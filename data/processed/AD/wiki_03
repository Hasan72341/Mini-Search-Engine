An example of such programs is \"notepad\" software (e.g. Windows Notepad). Text editors are provided with operating systems and software development packages, and can be used to change files such as configuration files, documentation files and programming language source code.\nPlain text and rich text.\nThere are important differences between plain text (created and edited by text editors) and rich text (such as that created by word processors or desktop publishing software). \nPlain text exclusively consists of character representation. Each character is represented by a fixed-length sequence of one, two, or four bytes, or as a variable-length sequence of one to four bytes, in accordance to specific character encoding conventions, such as ASCII, ISO/IEC\u00a02022, Shift JIS, UTF-8, or UTF-16. These conventions define many printable characters, but also non-printing characters that control the flow of the text, such as space, line break, and page break. Plain text contains no other information about the text itself, not even the character encoding convention employed. Plain text is stored in text files, although text files do not exclusively store plain text. Since the early days of computers, plain text was (once by necessity and now by convention) generally displayed using a monospace font, such that horizontal alignment and columnar formatting were sometimes done using whitespace characters.\nRich text, on the other hand, may contain metadata, character formatting data (e.g. typeface, size, weight and style), paragraph formatting data (e.g. indentation, alignment, letter and word distribution, and space between lines or other paragraphs), and page specification data (e.g. size, margin and reading direction). Rich text can be very complex. Rich text can be saved in binary format (e.g. DOC), text files adhering to a markup language (e.g. RTF or HTML), or in a hybrid form of both (e.g. Office Open XML).\nText editors are intended to open and save text files containing either plain text or anything that can be interpreted as plain text, including the markup for rich text or the markup for something else (e.g. SVG).\nHistory.\nBefore text editors existed, computer text was punched into cards with keypunch machines. Physical boxes of these thin cardboard cards were then inserted into a card reader. Magnetic tape, drum and disk card image files created from such card decks often had no line-separation characters at all, and assumed fixed-length 80- or 90-character records. An alternative to cards was Punched tape. It could be created by some teleprinters (such as the Teletype), which used special characters to indicate ends of records. Some early operating systems included batch text editors, either integrated with language processors or as separate utility programs; one early example was the ability to edit SQUOZE source files for SCAT in the SHARE Operating System.\nThe first interactive text editors were \"line editors\" oriented to teletypes: teleprinter-style or typewriter-style terminals that mechanically printed both input and output on the same continuous roll of paper, without an illuminated display. Commands (often a single keystroke) effected edits to a file at an insertion point, that the operator needed to keep track of, called the \"cursor\". Edits were verified by typing a command to print a small section of the file, and periodically by printing the entire file. In some line editors, the cursor could be moved by commands that specified the line number in the file, text strings (context) for which to search, and eventually regular expressions. Line editors were major improvements over keypunching. Some line editors could be used by keypunch; editing commands could be taken from a deck of cards and applied to a specified file. Some common line editors supported a \"verify\" mode in which change commands displayed the altered lines.\nAn example configuration, circa 1975, was a Teletype Model 33 as a console to a PDP-11 using Version 6 Unix, manipulating text with the \"ed\", the standard UNIX text editor.\nWhen computer terminals with video screens became available, screen-based text editors (sometimes called just \"screen editors\") became common. One of the earliest full-screen editors was O26, which was written for the operator console of the CDC 6000 series computers in 1967. Another early full-screen editor was vi. Written in the 1970s, it is still a standard editor on Unix and Linux operating systems. Also written in the 1970s was the UCSD Pascal Screen Oriented Editor, which was optimized both for indented source code and general text. Emacs, one of the first free and open-source software projects, is another early full-screen or real-time editor, one that was ported to many systems. The 1977 Commodore PET was the first mass-market computer to feature a full-screen editor. A full-screen editor's ease-of-use and speed (compared to the line-based editors) motivated many early purchases of video terminals.\nThe core data structure in a text editor is the one that manages the string (sequence of characters) or list of records that represents the current state of the file being edited.\nWhile the former could be stored in a single long consecutive array of characters,\nthe desire for text editors that could more quickly insert text, delete text, and undo/redo previous edits led to the development of more complicated sequence data structures.\nA typical text editor uses a gap buffer, a linked list of lines (as in PaperClip), a piece table, or a rope, as its sequence data structure.\nTypology.\nSome text editors are small and simple, while others offer broad and complex functions. For example, Unix and Unix-like operating systems have the pico editor (or a variant), but many also include the vi and Emacs editors. Microsoft Windows systems come with the simple Notepad, though many people\u2014especially programmers\u2014prefer other with more features. Under Apple Macintosh's classic Mac OS there was the native TeachText later replaced by SimpleText in 1994, which was replaced in Mac OS X by TextEdit, which combines features of a text editor with those typical of a word processor such as rulers, margins and multiple font selection. These features are not available simultaneously, but must be switched by user command, or through the program automatically determining the file type. \nMost word processors can read and write files in plain text format, allowing them to open files saved from text editors. Saving these files from a word processor, however, requires ensuring the file is written in plain text format, and that any text encoding or BOM settings will not obscure the file for its intended use. Non-WYSIWYG word processors, such as WordStar, are more easily pressed into service as text editors, and in fact were commonly used as such during the 1980s. The default file format of these word processors often resembles a markup language, with the basic format being plain text and visual formatting achieved using non-printing control characters or escape sequences. Later word processors like Microsoft Word store their files in a binary format and are almost never used to edit plain text files.\nSome text editors can edit unusually large files such as log files or an entire database placed in a single file. Simpler text editors may just read files into the computer's main memory. With larger files, this may be a slow process, and the entire file may not fit. Some text editors do not let the user start editing until this read-in is complete. Editing performance also often suffers in nonspecialized editors, with the editor taking seconds or even minutes to respond to keystrokes or navigation commands. Specialized editors have optimizations such as only storing the visible portion of large files in memory, improving editing performance.\nSome editors are programmable, meaning, e.g., they can be customized for specific uses. With a programmable editor it is easy to automate repetitive tasks or, add new functionality or even implement a new application within the framework of the editor. One common motive for customizing is to make a text editor use the commands of another text editor with which the user is more familiar, or to duplicate missing functionality the user has come to depend on. Software developers often use editor customizations tailored to the programming language or development environment they are working in. The programmability of some text editors is limited to enhancing the core editing functionality of the program, but Emacs can be extended far beyond editing text files\u2014for web browsing, reading email, online chat, managing files or playing games and is often thought of as a Lisp execution environment with a Text User Interface. Emacs can even be programmed to emulate Vi, its rival in the traditional editor wars of Unix culture.\nAn important group of programmable editors uses REXX as a scripting language. These \"orthodox editors\" contain a \"command line\" into which commands and macros can be typed and text lines into which line commands and macros can be typed. Most such editors are derivatives of ISPF/PDF EDIT or of XEDIT, IBM's flagship editor for VM/SP through z/VM. Among them are THE, KEDIT, X2, Uni-edit, and SEDIT.\nA text editor written or customized for a specific use can determine what the user is editing and assist the user, often by completing programming terms and showing tooltips with relevant documentation. Many text editors for software developers include source code syntax highlighting and automatic indentation to make programs easier to read and write. Programming editors often let the user select the name of an include file, function or variable, then jump to its definition. Some also allow for easy navigation back to the original section of code by storing the initial cursor location or by displaying the requested definition in a popup window or temporary buffer. Some editors implement this ability themselves, but often an auxiliary utility like ctags is used to locate the definitions.\nSpecialized editors.\nSome editors include special features and extra functions, for instance,\nProgrammable editors can usually be enhanced to perform any or all of these functions, but simpler editors focus on just one, or, like gPHPedit, are targeted at a single programming language.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "30311", "revid": "3617193", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30311", "title": "Tennis court", "text": "Type of sports venue\nA tennis court is the venue where the sport of tennis is played. It is a firm rectangular surface with a low net stretched across the centre. The same surface can be used to play both doubles and singles matches. A variety of surfaces can be used to create a tennis court, each with its own characteristics which affect the playing style of the game.\nDimensions.\nThe dimensions of a tennis court are defined and regulated by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) governing body and are written down in the annual 'Rules of Tennis' document. The court is long. Its width is for singles matches and for doubles matches. The service line is from the net. Additional clear space around the court is needed in order for players to reach overrun balls for a total of wide and long. A net is stretched across the full width of the court, parallel with the baselines, dividing it into two equal ends. The net is high at the posts, and high in the center. The net posts are outside the doubles court on each side or, for a singles net, outside the singles court on each side.\nBased on the standard rules of tennis, the size of the court is measured to the \"outside\" of the respective baselines and sidelines. The \"service\" lines (\"T\" and the \"service\" line) are centered. The ball must completely miss the line to be considered \"out\". This also means that the width of the line (except for the center service line) is irrelevant to play. The center service line is , the other lines are between wide, whereas the baseline may be up to wide.\nSmaller courts.\nThe ITF's Play and Stay campaign promotes playing on smaller courts with slower red, orange, and green balls for younger children. This gives children more time and control so they can serve, rally, and score from the first lesson on courts that are sized to fit their bodies. The ITF has mandated that official competition for children aged 10 years and under should be played on \"Orange\" courts long by wide. Competition for children under 8 years is played on \"Red\" courts that are long and wide. The net is always 0.8 m high in the center.\nSurfaces.\nTennis is played on a variety of surfaces and each surface has its own characteristics which affect the playing style of the game. There are four main types of courts depending on the materials used for the court surface: clay courts, hard courts, grass courts and carpet courts. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) lists different surfaces and properties and classifies surfaces into one of five pace settings:\nOf the current four Grand Slam tournaments, the Australian and US Open use hard courts, the French Open is played on clay, and Wimbledon, the only Grand Slam to have always been played on the same surface, is played on grass. The Australian Open switched from grass to hard courts in 1988 and in its early years the French championship alternated between clay and sand/rubble courts. The US Open is the only major to have been played on three surfaces; it was played on grass from its inception until 1974, green clay from 1975 until 1977 and hard courts since it moved from the West Side Tennis Club to the National Tennis Center in 1978.\nITF uses the following classification for tennis court surface types:\nClay courts.\nClay courts are made of crushed shale, stone or brick. The French Open is the only Grand Slam tournament still played on clay; the courts there are made from crushed red brick (known commonly as \"European clay\", or \"terre battue\" in France). \nClay courts slow down the ball and produce a high bounce in comparison to grass or hard courts, taking away many of the advantages of big serves. For this reason, the clay court heavily favors baseline players, as it is hard for attacking serve-and-volley players to dominate on the surface. Clay courts are cheaper to construct than other types of tennis courts, but a clay surface costs more to maintain. Clay courts need to be rolled to preserve flatness. The clay's water content must be balanced; green clay courts (see below) are generally required to be sloped to allow water run-off.\nClay courts are more common in Europe and Latin America than in North America. The clay courts that do exist in the United States tend to be made of green clay, which consists of crushed basalt; they are usually known by their brand name, HarTru. A \"maroon\" form of clay, advertized as \"American red clay\", is also used at the U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships in Houston, Texas. Clay courts with a top dressing of burnt shale \u2013 which makes the surface grittier and allows for faster play \u2013 can be found in Britain, especially in northern England and Scotland (where they are known as \"blaes\" courts). More esoteric clay-like surfaces, meanwhile, still exist in rural Australia ('antbed' courts, made out of compacted termite mounds and/or loam), India (animal dung) and the Philippines (crushed sea-shells).\nHistorically for the Grand Slams clay courts have been used at the French Open since 1891 and the US Open from 1975 to 1977 (on green clay).\nGrass courts.\nGrass courts are the fastest type of courts in common use. They consist of grass grown on very hard-packed soil, which adds additional variables: bounces depend on how healthy the grass is, how recently it has been mowed, and the wear and tear of recent play. Points are usually very quick where fast, low bounces keep rallies short, and the serve plays a more important role than on other surfaces. Grass courts thus tend to favour serve-and-volley tennis players.\nGrass courts were once among the most common tennis surfaces, but are now rare due to high maintenance costs, as they must be watered and mown often, and take a longer time to dry after rain than hard courts.\nHistorically for the Grand Slams grass courts have been used at Wimbledon since 1877, the US Open from 1881 to 1974, and the Australian Open from 1905 to 1987.\nHard courts.\nHardcourts are made of uniform rigid material, often covered with an acrylic surface layer to offer greater consistency of bounce than other outdoor surfaces. Hardcourts can vary in speed, though they are faster than clay but not as fast as grass courts. The quantity of sand added to the paint can greatly affect the rate at which the ball slows down. As well as acrylic, asphalt and concrete are also examples of hardcourt surfaces.\nThe US Open is played on Laykold while the Australian Open is played on GreenSet, both acrylic-topped hardcourt surfaces.\nHistorically for the Grand Slams hardcourts have been used at the US Open since 1978 and the Australian Open since 1988.\nCarpet courts.\n\"Carpet\" in tennis means any removable court covering. Indoor arenas store rolls of rubber-backed court surfacing and install it temporarily for tennis events, but they are not in use any more for professional events. A short piled form of artificial turf infilled with sand is used for some outdoor courts, particularly in Asia. Carpet is generally a fast surface, faster than hardcourt, with low bounce.\nNotable tennis tournaments previously held on carpet courts were the WCT Finals, Paris Masters, U.S. Pro Indoor and Kremlin Cup. Since 2009, their use has been discontinued on the top tier of the ATP. ATP Challenger Tour tournaments such as the Trofeo Citt\u00e0 di Brescia still use carpet courts. The WTA Tour's last carpet court event, the International-level Tournoi de Qu\u00e9bec, was discontinued after 2018.\nIndoor courts.\nSome tennis courts are indoors, which allows play regardless of weather conditions and is more comfortable for spectators.\nDifferent court surfaces have been used indoors. Hard courts are most common indoors, as they are the easiest to install and maintain. If the installation is permanent, they are constructed on an asphalt or concrete base, as with outdoor courts. Temporary indoor hard courts are typically constructed using wooden floor panels topped with acrylic which are installed over the venue's standard floor. This is the system used for modern indoor professional events such as the ATP Finals.\nClay courts can be installed indoors with subsurface watering systems to keep the clay from drying out, and have been used for Davis Cup matches.\nCarpet courts were once the most prominent of indoor surfaces, especially in temporary venues, but have largely been replaced by removable hard courts. They were used on both the ATP World Tour and World Championship Tennis circuits, though no events currently use them.\nHistorically, other surfaces have been used indoors such as wood courts at the defunct World Covered Court Championships and London Indoor Professional Championships.\nThe conclusion of the Wimbledon Championships, in 2012, was played on the lawn of Centre Court under the closed roof and artificial lights; the Halle Open has also seen a number of matches played on its grass court in the Gerry Weber Stadion with the roof closed. These, however, are outdoor venues with retractable roofs.\nGallery.\nBelow are photographs of a number of different surfaces, each featuring their relevant ITF surface code:\nTerminology.\nCommon tennis court terms:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "30312", "revid": "50519108", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30312", "title": "The Communist Manifesto", "text": "1848 political pamphlet by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels\nThe Communist Manifesto (), originally the Manifesto of the Communist Party (), is a political pamphlet written by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. It was commissioned by the Communist League and published in London in 1848. The text represents the first and most systematic attempt by the two founders of scientific socialism to codify for wide consumption the historical materialist idea, namely, that \"the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles\", in which social classes are defined by the relationship of people to the means of production. Published amid the Revolutions of 1848 in Europe, the manifesto has become one of the world's most influential political documents.\nIn the \"Manifesto\", Marx and Engels combine philosophical materialism with the Hegelian dialectical method in order to analyze the development of European society through its modes of production, including primitive communism, antiquity, feudalism, and capitalism, noting the emergence of a new, dominant class at each stage. The text outlines the relationship between the means of production, relations of production, forces of production, and mode of production, and posits that changes in society's economic \"base\" affect changes in its \"superstructure\". The authors assert that capitalism is marked by the exploitation of the proletariat (working class of wage labourers) by the ruling bourgeoisie, which is \"constantly revolutionising the instruments [and] relations of production, and with them the whole relations of society\". They argue that capital's need for a flexible labour force dissolves the old relations, and that its global expansion in search of new markets creates \"a world after its own image\".\nThe \"Manifesto\" concludes that capitalism does not offer humanity the possibility of self-realization, instead ensuring that humans are perpetually stunted and alienated. It theorizes that capitalism will bring about its own destruction by polarizing and unifying the proletariat, and predicts that a revolution will lead to the emergence of communism, a classless society in which \"the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all\". Marx and Engels propose the following transitional policies: abolition of private property in land and inheritance; introduction of a progressive income tax; confiscation of emigrants' and rebels' property; nationalisation of credit, communication, and transport; expansion and integration of industry and agriculture; enforcement of universal obligation of labour; provision of universal education; and elimination of child labour. The text ends with three rousing sentences, reworked and popularized into the famous slogan of working-class solidarity: \"Workers of the world, unite! You have nothing to lose but your chains\".\nSynopsis.\n\"The Communist Manifesto\" is divided into a preamble and four sections. The preamble begins: \"A spectre is haunting Europe\u2014the spectre of communism.\" Pointing out that it was widespread for politicians\u2014both those in government and those in the opposition\u2014to label their opponents as communists, the authors infer that those in power acknowledge communism to be a power in itself. Subsequently, the preamble exhorts communists to openly publish their views and aims, which is the very function of the \"Manifesto\".\nThe first section of the document, \"Bourgeois and Proletarians\", outlines historical materialism, and states that \"the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles\". According to the authors, all societies in history had taken the form of an oppressed majority exploited by an oppressive minority. Marx and Engels claim that in their time under capitalism, the industrial working class, or \"proletariat\", is engaging in class struggle against the owners of the means of production, the \"bourgeoisie\". The bourgeoisie, through the \"constant revolutionising of production [and] uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions\" had emerged by 1848 as the supreme class in society, displacing all the old powers of feudalism. The bourgeoisie continuously exploits the proletariat for its labour power, creating profit for themselves and accumulating capital. In doing so, however, Marx and Engels argue that the bourgeois class is serving as \"its own grave-diggers\" because, in the view of the authors, proletarians will inevitably become conscious of their own potential and rise to power through revolution, overthrowing the bourgeoisie.\nSection II, \"Proletarians and Communists\", starts by explaining the relationship of \"conscious communists\" (i.e., those who identify as communists) to the rest of the working class. The communists' party will not oppose other working-class parties, but unlike them, it will express the general will and defend the shared interests of the world's proletariat as a whole, independent of all nationalities. The authors go on to defend communism from various objections, including claims that it advocates communal prostitution or disincentivises people from working. Several pages into Section II, the authors surprisingly switch the narrative voice and address the reader directly: \"You are horrified at our intending to do away with private property. But in your existing society, private property is already done away with for nine-tenths of the population; its existence for the few is solely due to its non-existence in the hands of those nine-tenths.\" The section ends by outlining a set of short-term demands\u2014among them a progressive income tax; abolition of inheritances and private property; abolition of child labour; free public education; nationalisation of the means of transport and communication; centralisation of credit via a national bank; expansion of publicly owned land, etc.\u2014the implementation of which, it is argued, would result in the precursor to a classless society.\nSection III, \"Socialist and Communist Literature\", distinguishes communism from other socialist doctrines prevalent at the time, which are categorised as Reactionary Socialism; Conservative or Bourgeois Socialism; and Critical-Utopian Socialism and Communism. The first category is subdivided into \"Feudal Socialism\", \"Petty-Bourgeois Socialism\", and \"German or 'True' Socialism\". While the degree of reproach varies toward these rival socialist perspectives, all are dismissed by Marx and Engels for advocating reformism and for failing to recognise the pre-eminent revolutionary role of the proletariat. The authors are least hostile toward the utopian socialists whose attacks on existing society \"are full of the most valuable materials for the enlightenment of the working class.\"\nThe fourth and concluding section, \"Position of the Communists in Relation to the Various Opposition Parties\", briefly discusses the communist position on struggles in specific countries in the mid-19th century such as in France, Switzerland, Poland, and lastly Germany, which is said to be \"on the eve of a bourgeois revolution\" that is but \"the prelude to an immediately following proletarian revolution\" (a prediction later criticized as a fundamental error in the \"Manifesto\"). The section ends by declaring an alliance with the democratic socialists, boldly supporting other communist revolutions, and calling for united international proletarian action: \"Working Men of All Countries, Unite!\"\nWriting.\nIn spring of 1847, Marx and Engels joined the League of the Just, which was soon convinced by the duo's ideas of \"critical communism\". At its First Congress from 2\u20139 June, the League tasked Engels with drafting a \"Creed\" document outlining the League's programme, to be submitted for review at the end of the Congress. Engels quickly produced the \"Draft of a Communist Confession of Faith\" in question-and-answer format, similar to a catechism, e.g.:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Question 1: \"Are you a communist?\"&lt;br&gt;\"Answer\": Yes.&lt;br&gt;Question 2: \"What is the aim of the communists?\"&lt;br&gt;To organize society in such a way that each of its members can develop and utilize all his potentialities and powers in full freedom without jeopardizing the foundations of this society. In total, there were 22 questions, and the answers were relatively terse. In October, Engels arrived at the League's Paris branch to find that Moses Hess had written his own \"Creed\" document for the League (now called the League of Communists). Engels severely criticised this document (in Hess's absence), and convinced the rest of the League to entrust him with drafting a new one. At the end of October, he wrote the \"Principles of Communism\", again in the style of a catechism but now with 25 questions and more detailed, concrete answers than before.\nOn 23 November, prior to the League of Communists' Second Congress (29 November \u2013 8 December 1847), Engels sent a letter to Marx, expressing a desire to eschew the catechism format in favour of a manifesto, because he felt it must contain \"a certain amount of history.\" On 28 November, Marx and Engels met at Ostend in Belgium, and a few days later, gathered at the Soho, London headquarters of the German Workers' Education Association to attend the Congress. Over the next ten days, intense debate raged between League functionaries; Marx eventually dominated the others and, overcoming \"stiff and prolonged opposition\", in Harold Laski's words, secured a majority for his programme. The League thus unanimously adopted a far more combative resolution than at the First Congress in June. Marx (especially) and Engels were commissioned to draw up a manifesto for the League.\nUpon returning to Brussels, Marx engaged in \"ceaseless procrastination\", according to his biographer Francis Wheen. Working only intermittently on the \"Manifesto\", Marx spent much of his time delivering lectures on political economy at the German Workers' Education Association, writing articles for the \"\", and giving a long speech on free trade. Following this, he even spent a week (17\u201326 January 1848) in Ghent to establish a branch of the Democratic Association. Having not heard from Marx for nearly two months, the Central Committee of the Communist League sent him an ultimatum on 24 or 26 January, demanding he submit the completed manuscript by 1 February. This imposition spurred Marx on, who struggled to work without the pressure of a deadline, and he seems to have rushed to finish the job in time. As evidence of the haste, historian Eric Hobsbawm points to the absence of any extant preliminary drafts; only one \"Manifesto\" draft page has ever been located.\nIn all, the \"Manifesto\" was written over a span of 6\u20137 weeks. Although Engels is credited as co-author, the final version was penned exclusively by Marx. Laski infers from the January ultimatum letter that the Communist League considered Marx to be the principal draftsman and that Engels was merely their agent, imminently replaceable. Engels himself wrote in a preface to the 1883 German edition: \"The basic thought running through the \"Manifesto\" [...] belongs solely and exclusively to Marx\". While Laski does not disagree, he suggests that Engels underplays his own contribution with characteristic modesty, and notes the \"close resemblance between its substance and that of the [\"Principles of Communism\"]\". Moreover, Laski says that while writing the \"Manifesto\", Marx was borrowing from the \"joint stock of ideas\" he developed with Engels, \"a kind of intellectual bank account upon which either could draw freely\". Anthony Arnove also believes that \"the kernel of the\u00a0\"Manifesto\"\" can be found in the \"Principles of Communism\", and that Marx's real task \"was to translate this catechism into the form of a manifesto, with more historical narrative and greater rhetorical force.\" \nPublication.\nInitial publication and obscurity, 1848\u20131872.\nIn late February 1848, the \"Manifesto\" was anonymously published by the Communist Workers' Educational Association (), based at 46 Liverpool Street, in the Bishopsgate Without area of the City of London. Written in German, the 23-page pamphlet was titled and had a dark-green cover. It was reprinted three times and serialised in the \"Deutsche Londoner Zeitung\", a newspaper for German \"\u00e9migr\u00e9\"s. On 4 March, one day after the serialisation in the \"Zeitung\" began, Marx was expelled by Belgian police. Two weeks later, around 20 March, a thousand copies of the \"Manifesto\" reached Paris, and from there to Germany in early April. In April\u2013May the text was corrected for printing and punctuation mistakes; Marx and Engels would use this 30-page version as the basis for future editions of the \"Manifesto\".\nAlthough the \"Manifesto\"'s preamble announced that it was \"to be published in the English, French, German, Italian, Flemish and Danish languages\", the initial printings were only in German. Polish and Danish translations soon followed the German original in London, and by the end of 1848, a Swedish translation was published with a new title\u2014\"The Voice of Communism: Declaration of the Communist Party\". In November 1850, the \"Manifesto of the Communist Party\" had its first English publication when George Julian Harney serialised Helen Macfarlane's translation in his Chartist newspaper \"The Red Republican\". Her version begins: \"A frightful hobgoblin stalks throughout Europe. We are haunted by a ghost, the ghost of Communism\". For her translation, the Lancashire-based Macfarlane probably consulted Engels, who had abandoned his own English translation half way. Harney's introduction revealed the \"Manifesto\"'s hitherto-anonymous authors' identities for the first time.\nA French translation of the \"Manifesto\" was published just before the June Days Uprising was crushed. Its influence in the Europe-wide Revolutions of 1848 was restricted to Germany, where the Cologne-based Communist League and its newspaper \"Neue Rheinische Zeitung\", edited by Marx, played an important role. Within a year of its establishment, in May 1849, the \"Zeitung\" was suppressed; Marx was expelled from Germany and had to seek refuge in London. In 1851, members of the Communist League's central board were arrested by the Prussian Secret Police. At their trial in Cologne 18 months later in November 1852, they were sentenced to 3\u20136 years' imprisonment. For Engels, the revolution was \"forced into the background by the reaction that began with the defeat of the Paris workers in June 1848, and was finally excommunicated 'by law' in the conviction of the Cologne Communists in November 1852\".\nAfter the defeat of the 1848 revolutions, the \"Manifesto\" fell into obscurity, where it remained throughout the 1850s and 1860s. Hobsbawm says that by November 1850 the \"Manifesto\" \"had become sufficiently scarce for Marx to think it worth reprinting section III [...] in the last issue\" of his short-lived London newspaper, \"Neue Rheinische Zeitung\". Over the next two decades only a few new editions were published; these included an (unauthorised and occasionally inaccurate) 1869 Russian translation by Mikhail Bakunin in Geneva, and an 1866 edition in Berlin\u2014the first time the \"Manifesto\" was published in Germany. According to Hobsbawm, \"By the middle 1860s virtually nothing that Marx had written in the past was any longer in print\". However, John Cowell-Stepney did print an abridged version in the \"Social Economist\" in August/September 1869, in time for the Basle Congress.\nRise, 1872\u20131917.\nIn the early 1870s, the \"Manifesto\" and its authors experienced a revival in fortunes. Hobsbawm identifies three reasons for this. The first is the leadership role Marx played in the International Workingmen's Association (aka the First International). Second, Marx came into great prominence among socialists\u2014and equal notoriety among the authorities\u2014for his support of the Paris Commune of 1871, elucidated in \"The Civil War in France\". Third, and perhaps most significantly was the treason trial of the Social Democratic Workers' Party of Germany (SDAP) leaders. During the proceedings, prosecutors read the text of the \"Manifesto\" into the court record; this meant that the pamphlet could legally be published in Germany. Thus in 1872 Marx and Engels rushed out a new German-language edition. In the preface, they acknowledged that while some of the document's details had become dated in the intervening quarter century, \"the general principles laid down in the \"Manifesto\" are, on the whole, as correct today as ever.\" This edition was the first time the title was shortened to \"The Communist Manifesto\" (\"Das Kommunistische Manifest\"), and it became the version the authors based future editions upon. Between 1871 and 1873, the \"Manifesto\" was published in over nine editions in six languages. On 30 December 1871, \"Woodhull &amp; Claflin's Weekly\" published it in the U.S. for the first time; it was printed in English using the Helen Macfarlane translation. By the mid-1870s, however, the \"Communist Manifesto\" remained Marx and Engels' only work to be even moderately well-known.\nOver the next forty years, as social-democratic parties rose across Europe and parts of the world, so did the publication of the \"Manifesto\" alongside them, in hundreds of editions in thirty languages. Marx and Engels wrote a new preface for the 1882 Russian edition, translated by Georgi Plekhanov in Geneva. In it they wondered if Russia could directly become a communist society, or if she would become capitalist first like other European countries. After Marx's death in March 1883, Engels provided the prefaces for five editions between 1888 and 1893. Among these is the 1888 English edition, translated by Samuel Moore and approved by Engels, who also provided notes throughout the text. It has become the standard English-language edition ever since.\nThe \"Manifesto\"'s principal sphere of influence, as measured by the locations where editions were published, was in the \"central belt of Europe\", from Russia in the east to France in the west. In comparison, the pamphlet had little impact on politics in southwest and southeast Europe, and moderate presence in the north. Outside Europe, Chinese and Japanese translations were published, as were Spanish editions in Latin America. The first Chinese edition of the book was translated by Zhu Zhixin after the 1905 Russian Revolution in a Tongmenghui newspaper along with articles on socialist movements in Europe, North America, and Japan.\nThis uneven spread in the \"Manifesto\"'s popularity reflected the uneven development of socialist movements, and of the adoption of Marxist socialism, in various geographical regions. Also, there was not always a strong correlation between a social-democratic party's strength in a country and the \"Manifesto\"'s popularity there. For instance, the German SPD printed only a few thousand copies of the \"Manifesto\" every year, but a few hundred thousand copies of the \"Erfurt Programme\". The mass-based social-democratic parties of the Second International did not require their rank-and-file to be well-versed in theory; Marxist works such as the \"Manifesto\" or were read primarily by party theoreticians. On the other hand, small, dedicated militant parties and Marxist sects in the West took pride in knowing the \"Manifesto\" by heart. Hobsbawm writes, \"This was the milieu in which 'the clearness of a comrade could be gauged invariably from the number of earmarks on his \"Manifesto\"'.\"\nUbiquity, 1917\u2013present.\nFollowing the October Revolution of 1917 that swept the Vladimir Lenin-led Bolsheviks to power in Russia, the world's first socialist state was founded explicitly along Marxist lines. The Soviet Union, which Bolshevik Russia would become a part of, was a one-party state under the rule of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). Unlike their mass-based counterparts of the Second International, the CPSU and other Leninist parties like it in the Third International expected their members to know the classic works of Marx, Engels and Lenin. Further, party leaders were expected to base their policy decisions on Marxist\u2013Leninist ideology. Therefore, the \"Manifesto\" was required reading.\nWidespread dissemination of Marx and Engels' works became an important policy objective. Backed by a sovereign state, the CPSU had relatively inexhaustible resources for this purpose. Works by Marx, Engels, and Lenin were published on a very large scale, and cheap editions of their works were available in several languages across the world. These publications were either specific writings, or they were compendia such as the various editions of Marx and Engels' \"Selected Works\", or their \"Collected Works\". This affected the destiny of the \"Manifesto\" in several ways. Firstly, in terms of circulation; in 1932 the American and British Communist Parties printed several hundred thousand copies of a cheap edition for \"probably the largest mass edition ever issued in English\". Secondly, the \"Manifesto\" entered political-science syllabi in universities. For its centenary in 1948, the \"Manifesto\" had moved beyond the exclusive domain of Marxists and academicians; general publishers also printed it in large numbers. \"In short, it was no longer only a classic Marxist document\", Hobsbawm noted, \"it had become a political classic \"tout court\".\"\nTotal sales of the \"Manifesto\" have been estimated at 500 million, and it is one of the four best-selling books of all time. In 1920, the \"Communist Manifesto\" was printed and distributed in Chinese.104 Chen Wangdao is credited as translator of the first printing.106\nEven after the collapse of the Soviet Bloc in the 1990s, the \"Communist Manifesto\" has remained ubiquitous; Hobsbawm says that \"In states without censorship, almost certainly anyone within reach of a good bookshop, and certainly anyone within reach of a good library, not to mention the internet, can have access to it\". The 150th anniversary once again brought a deluge of attention in the press and the academia, as well as new editions fronted by introductions to the text by academics. One of these, \"The Communist Manifesto: A Modern Edition\" by Verso, was touted by a critic in the \"London Review of Books\" as being a \"stylish red-ribboned edition of the work. It is designed as a sweet keepsake, an exquisite collector's item. In Manhattan, a prominent Fifth Avenue store put copies of this choice new edition in the hands of shop-window mannequins, displayed in come-hither poses and fashionable d\u00e9colletage\".\nLegacy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"With the clarity and brilliance of genius, this work outlines a new world-conception, consistent materialism, which also embraces the realm of social life; dialectics, as the most comprehensive and profound doctrine of development; the theory of the class struggle and of the world-historic revolutionary role of the proletariat\u2014the creator of a new, communist society.\"\n\u2014Vladimir Lenin on the \"Manifesto\", 1914\nA number of late-20th- and 21st-century writers have commented on the \"Communist Manifesto\"'s continuing relevance. In a special issue of the \"Socialist Register\" commemorating the \"Manifesto\"'s 150th anniversary, Peter Osborne argued that it was \"the single most influential text written in the nineteenth century\". Academic John Raines in 2002 noted: \"In our day this Capitalist Revolution has reached the farthest corners of the earth. The tool of money has produced the miracle of the new global market and the ubiquitous shopping mall. Read \"The Communist Manifesto\", written more than one hundred and fifty years ago, and you will discover that Marx foresaw it all\". In 2003, English Marxist Chris Harman stated: \"There is still a compulsive quality to its prose as it provides insight after insight into the society in which we live, where it comes from and where it's going to. It is still able to explain, as mainstream economists and sociologists cannot, today's world of recurrent wars and repeated economic crisis, of hunger for hundreds of millions on the one hand and 'overproduction' on the other. There are passages that could have come from the most recent writings on globalisation\". Alex Callinicos, editor of \"International Socialism\", stated in 2010: \"This is indeed a manifesto for the 21st century\". Writing in \"The London Evening Standard\", Andrew Neather cited Verso Books' 2012 re-edition of \"The Communist Manifesto\" with an introduction by Eric Hobsbawm as part of a resurgence of left-wing-themed ideas which includes the publication of Owen Jones' book \"\" and Jason Barker's documentary \"Marx Reloaded\".\nIn contrast, critics such as revisionist Marxist and reformist socialist Eduard Bernstein distinguished between \"immature\" early Marxism\u2014as exemplified by \"The Communist Manifesto\" written by Marx and Engels in their youth\u2014that he opposed for its violent Blanquist tendencies and later \"mature\" Marxism that he supported. This latter form refers to Marx in his later life seemingly claiming that socialism, under certain circumstances, could be achieved through peaceful means via legislative reform in capitalist societies with parliamentary systems.\nBernstein declared that the massive and homogeneous working-class posited in the \"Communist Manifesto\" did not exist, and that contrary to predictions of a proletarian majority emerging, the middle-class was growing under capitalism and not disappearing as Marx had forecast. Marx himself later acknowledged that the Petite bourgeoisie was not disappearing, for example, in his 1863 work, \"Theories of Surplus Value\". The obscurity of his later work means that Marx's acknowledgement of his error was not well known. George Boyer described the \"Manifesto\" as \"very much a period piece, a document of what was called the 'hungry' 1840s\". Hal Draper rejected Bernstein's arguments about the middle class, stating that the \"Manifesto\" actually notes that, although individual members of this class are being constantly proletarianized, the class 'limps on, in a more and more ruined state'.\nForemost among the \"Manifesto\"'s criticized predictions is that world revolution is imminent. Seymour Lipset wrote in 1981 that \"Marx's fundamental premise has been totally refuted by history\", i.e., that class conflicts in highly industrialized countries would soon result in workers overturning capitalism. After asserting in a book review that the \"Manifesto\" has enduring relevance, Cory Doctorow added: \"This despite its most glaring defect, because, of course, the \"Manifesto\"'s chief prediction\u00a0\u2013 the imminent downfall of capitalism\u00a0\u2013 was dead wrong.\"\nMany have drawn attention to the passage in the \"Manifesto\" that seems to sneer at the stupidity of the rustic: \"The bourgeoisie [...] draws all nations [...] into civilisation[.] [...] It has created enormous cities [...] and thus rescued a considerable part of the population from the idiocy [sic] of rural life\". However, as Eric Hobsbawm noted: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[W]hile there is no doubt that Marx at this time shared the usual townsman's contempt for, as well as ignorance of, the peasant milieu, the actual and analytically more interesting German phrase (\"dem Idiotismus des Landlebens entrissen\") referred not to \"stupidity\" but to \"the narrow horizons\", or \"the isolation from the wider society\" in which people in the countryside lived. It echoed the original meaning of the Greek term \"idiotes\" from which the current meaning of \"idiot\" or \"idiocy\" is derived, namely \"a person concerned only with his own private affairs and not with those of the wider community\". In the course of the decades since the 1840s, and in movements whose members, unlike Marx, were not classically educated, the original sense was lost and was misread. In 2013, a manuscript page of \"The Communist Manifesto\" was added to UNESCO's Memory of the World International Register along with Marx's annotated copy of \"Capital, VolumeI\". These are held among more of Marx's papers at the International Institute of Social History in Amsterdam.\nInfluences.\nMarx and Engels' political influences were wide-ranging, reacting to and taking inspiration from German idealist philosophy, French socialism, and English and Scottish political economy. \"The Communist Manifesto\" also takes influence from literature. In Jacques Derrida's work, \"Specters of Marx: The State of the Debt, the Work of Mourning and the New International\", he uses William Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" to frame a discussion of the history of the International, showing in the process the influence that Shakespeare's work had on Marx and Engels' writing. In his essay, \"Big Leagues: Specters of Milton and Republican International Justice between Shakespeare and Marx\", Christopher Warren makes the case that English poet John Milton also had a substantial influence on Marx and Engels' work. Historians of 19th-century reading habits have confirmed that Marx and Engels would have read these authors and it is known that Marx loved Shakespeare in particular. Milton, Warren argues, also shows a notable influence on \"The Communist Manifesto\", saying: \"Looking back on Milton's era, Marx saw a historical dialectic founded on inspiration in which freedom of the press, republicanism, and revolution were closely joined\". Milton's republicanism, Warren continues, served as \"a useful, if unlikely, bridge\" as Marx and Engels sought to forge a revolutionary international coalition. The \"Manifesto\" also makes reference to the \"revolutionary\" antibourgeois social criticism of Thomas Carlyle, whom Engels had read as early as May 1843.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It lies in a valley between low vine-covered hills of red sandstone in the west of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, near the border with Luxembourg and within the important Moselle wine region.\nFounded by the Romans in the late 1st century BC as \"Augusta Treverorum\" (\"The City of Augustus among the Treveri\"), Trier is considered Germany's oldest city. It is also the oldest seat of a bishop north of the Alps. Trier was one of the four capitals of the Roman Empire during the Tetrarchy period in the late 3rd and early 4th centuries. In the Middle Ages, the archbishop-elector of Trier was an important prince of the Church who controlled land from the French border to the Rhine. The archbishop-elector of Trier also had great significance as one of the seven electors of the Holy Roman Empire. Because of its significance during the Roman and Holy Roman empires, several monuments and cathedrals within Trier are listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nWith an approximate population of 110,000, Trier is the fourth-largest city in its state, after Mainz, Ludwigshafen, and Koblenz. The nearest major cities are Luxembourg City ( to the southwest), Saarbr\u00fccken ( southeast), and Koblenz ( northeast).\nThe University of Trier, the administration of the Trier-Saarburg district and the seat of the ADD (\"Aufsichts- und Dienstleistungsdirektion\"), which until 1999 was the borough authority of Trier, and the Academy of European Law (ERA) are all based in Trier. It is one of the five \"central places\" of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. Along with Luxembourg, Metz and Saarbr\u00fccken, fellow constituent members of the QuattroPole union of cities, it is central to the greater region encompassing Saar-Lor-Lux (Saarland, Lorraine and Luxembourg), Rhineland-Palatinate, and Wallonia.\nHistory.\nThe first traces of human settlement in the area of the city show evidence of linear pottery settlements dating from the early Neolithic period. Since the last pre-Christian centuries, members of the Celtic tribe of the Treveri settled in the area of today's Trier. The city of Trier derives its name from the later Latin locative \"in Tr\u0113ver\u012bs\" for earlier \"Augusta Treverorum\". According to the Archbishops of Trier, in the \"Gesta Treverorum\", the founder of the city of the Trevians is Trebeta. German historian Johannes Aventinus also credited Trebeta with building settlements at Metz, Mainz, Basel, Strasbourg, Speyer and Worms.\nThe historical record describes the Roman Empire subduing the Treveri in the 1st century BC and establishing Augusta Treverorum about 16 BC. The name distinguished it from the empire's many other cities honoring the first Roman emperor, Augustus. The city later became the capital of the province of Belgic Gaul; after the Diocletian Reforms, it became the capital of the prefecture of the Gauls, overseeing much of the Western Roman Empire. From 293 to 395, Trier was one of the residences of the Western Roman Emperor. In the 4th century, Trier was one of the largest cities in the Roman Empire with a population around 75,000 and perhaps as much as 100,000. The Porta Nigra (\"Black Gate\") dates from this era. A residence of the Western Roman emperor, Roman Trier was the birthplace of Saint Ambrose. Sometime between 395 and 418, probably in 407 the Roman administration moved the staff of the Praetorian Prefecture from Trier to Arles. The city continued to be inhabited but was not as prosperous as before. However, it remained the seat of a governor and had state factories for the production of ballistae and armor and woolen uniforms for the troops, clothing for the civil service, and high-quality garments for the Court. Northern Gaul was held by the Romans along a line (\"l\u012bmes\") from north of Cologne to the coast at Boulogne through what is today southern Belgium until 460. South of this line, Roman control was firm, as evidenced by the continuing operation of the imperial arms factory at Amiens.\nThe history of the relationship between the Copts of Egypt and the city of Trier goes back to the second half of the fourth century AD, specifically the year 336 AD, when Pope Athanasius I, the 20th Patriarch (328\u2013373 AD), was exiled to this city by order of Emperor Constantine the Great (25 July 306 \u2013 22 May 337 AD).\nPope Athanasius the Apostolic\u2014born around 295 AD\u2014spent his youth in clerical circles, namely in the episcopal residence in the city of Alexandria. This upbringing made him well-versed in the affairs of church administration, immersed in an atmosphere rich with the purely pastoral and educational concerns of the popes.\nThe Franks seized Trier from Roman administration in 459. In 870, it became part of Eastern Francia, which developed into the Holy Roman Empire. Relics of Saint Matthias brought to the city initiated widespread pilgrimages. The bishops of the city grew increasingly powerful and the Archbishopric of Trier was recognized as an electorate of the empire, one of the most powerful states of Germany. The University of Trier was founded in the city in 1473. In the 17th century, the Archbishops and Prince-Electors of Trier relocated their residence to Philippsburg Castle in Ehrenbreitstein, near Koblenz. A session of the Reichstag was held in Trier in 1512, during which the demarcation of the Imperial Circles was definitively established.\nIn the years from 1581 to 1593, the Trier witch trials were held. It was one of the four largest witch trials in Germany alongside the Fulda witch trials, the W\u00fcrzburg witch trial, and the Bamberg witch trials, perhaps even the largest one in European history. The persecutions started in the diocese of Trier in 1581 and reached the city itself in 1587, where it was to lead to the death of about 368 people, and was as such perhaps the biggest mass execution in Europe in peacetime. This counts only those executed within the city itself. The exact number of people executed in all the witch hunts within the diocese has never been established; a total of 1,000 has been suggested but not confirmed.\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, the French-Habsburg rivalry brought war to Trier. Spain and France fought over the city during the Thirty Years' War. The bishop was imprisoned by Spain and the Holy Roman Emperor for his support for France between 1635 and 1645. In later wars between the Empire and France, French troops occupied the city during the Nine Years' War, the War of the Spanish Succession, and the War of the Polish Succession. After conquering Trier again in 1794 during the French Revolutionary Wars, France annexed the city and the electoral archbishopric was dissolved. After the Napoleonic Wars ended in 1815, Trier passed to the Kingdom of Prussia. Karl Marx, the German philosopher and one of the founders of Marxism, was born in the city in 1818.\nAs part of the Prussian Rhineland, Trier developed economically during the 19th century. The city rose in revolt during the revolutions of 1848 in the German states, although the rebels were forced to concede. It became part of the German Empire in 1871.\nThe synagogue on Zuckerbergstrasse was looted during the November 1938 Kristallnacht and later completely destroyed in a bomb attack in 1944. Multiple Stolpersteine have been installed in Trier to commemorate those murdered and exiled during the Shoah.\nIn June 1940 during World War II over 60,000 British prisoners of war, captured at Dunkirk and Northern France, were marched to Trier, which became a staging post for British soldiers headed for German prisoner-of-war camps. Trier was heavily bombed and bombarded in 1944. The city became part of the new state of Rhineland-Palatinate after the war. The university, dissolved in 1797, was restarted in the 1970s, while the Cathedral of Trier was reopened in 1974 after undergoing substantial and long-lasting renovations. Trier officially celebrated its 2,000th anniversary in 1984. On 1 December 2020, 5 people were killed by an allegedly drunk driver during a vehicle-ramming attack. The Ehrang/Quint district of Trier was heavily damaged and flooded during the 16 July 2021 floods of Germany, Belgium, The Netherlands and Luxembourg.\nGeography.\nTrier sits in a hollow midway along the Moselle valley, with the most significant portion of the city on the east bank of the river. Wooded and vineyard-covered slopes stretch up to the Hunsr\u00fcck plateau in the south and the Eifel in the north. The border with the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is some away.\nNeighbouring municipalities.\n\"Listed in clockwise order, beginning with the northernmost; all municipalities belong to the Trier-Saarburg district\"\nSchweich, Kenn and Longuich (all part of the Verbandsgemeinde Schweich an der R\u00f6mischen Weinstra\u00dfe), Mertesdorf, Kasel, Waldrach, Morscheid, Korlingen and Gusterath (all in the Verbandsgemeinde Ruwer), Hockweiler, Franzenheim (both part of the Verbandsgemeinde Trier-Land), Konz and Wasserliesch (both part of the Verbandsgemeinde Konz), Igel, Trierweiler, Aach, Newel, Kordel, Zemmer (all in the Verbandsgemeinde Trier-Land).\nOrganization of city districts.\nThe Trier urban area is divided into 19 city districts. For each district there is an ' (local council) of between 9 and 15 members, as well as an ' (local representative). The local councils are charged with hearing the important issues that affect the district, although the final decision on any issue rests with the city council. The local councils nevertheless have the freedom to undertake limited measures within the bounds of their districts and their budgets.\nThe districts of Trier with area and inhabitants (December 31, 2009):\nClimate.\nTrier has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Cfb\"), but with greater extremes than the marine versions of northern Germany.

As a result of the European heat wave in 2003, the highest temperature recorded was 39\u00a0\u00b0C on 8 August of that year. On 25 July 2019, a record-breaking temperature of 40.6\u00a0\u00b0C was recorded.

It has a long history and has acquired several meanings and uses.\nAs a unit of mass, \"ton\" can mean:\nIts original use as a unit of volume has continued in the capacity of cargo ships and in units such as the \"freight ton\" and a number of other units, ranging from in size. \nBecause the ton (of any system of measuring weight) is usually the heaviest unit named in colloquial speech, its name also has figurative uses, singular and plural, informally meaning a large amount or quantity, or to a great degree, as in \"There's a ton of bees in this hive,\" \"We have tons of homework,\" and \"I love you a ton.\"\nHistory.\nThe ton is derived from the \"tun\", the term applied to a cask of the largest capacity. This could contain a volume between , which could weigh around , and occupy some of cargo space.\nUnits of mass/weight.\nThere are several similar units of mass or volume called the ton:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe difference between the short ton and the other common forms (\"long\" and \"metric\") is about 10%, while the metric and long tons differ by less than 2%.\nThe metric tonne is usually distinguished by its spelling when written, but in the United States and United Kingdom, it is pronounced the same as ton, hence is often spoken as \"metric ton\" when it is necessary to make the distinction. In the United Kingdom the final \"e\" of \"tonne\" can also be pronounced (). In Australia, it is pronounced .\nIn Ireland and most members of the Commonwealth of Nations, a ton is defined as .\nIn the United States and Canada, a ton is defined as .\nOther units of mass/weight.\nAssay ton (abbreviation 'AT') is not a unit of measurement but a standard quantity used in assaying ores of precious metals. A short assay ton is approximately and a long assay ton is approximately . These amounts bear the same ratio to a milligram as a short or long ton bears to a troy ounce. Therefore, the number of milligrams of a particular metal found in a sample weighing one assay ton gives the number of troy ounces of metal contained in a ton of ore.\nIn documents that predate 1960 the word \"ton\" is sometimes spelled \"tonne\", but in more recent documents \"tonne\" refers exclusively to the metric ton.\nIn nuclear power plants tHM and MTHM mean tonnes of heavy metals, and MTU means tonnes of uranium. In the steel industry, the abbreviation THM means 'tons/tonnes hot metal', which refers to the amount of liquid iron or steel that is produced, particularly in the context of blast furnace production or specific consumption.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;A dry ton or dry tonne has the same mass value, but the material (sludge, slurries, compost, and similar mixtures in which solid material is soaked with or suspended in water) has been dried to a relatively low, consistent moisture level (dry weight). If the material is in its natural, wet state, it is called a wet ton or wet tonne.\nSubdivisions.\nBoth the UK definition of long ton and US definition of short ton have similar underlying bases. Each is equivalent to 20 hundredweight; however, they are long and short hundredweight, respectively.\nBefore the 20th century there were several definitions. Prior to the 15th century in England, the ton was 20\u00a0hundredweight, each of 108\u00a0lb, giving a ton of . In the 19th century in different parts of Britain, definitions of 2,240, or 2,352, or 2,400\u00a0lb were used, with 2,000\u00a0lb for explosives; the legal ton was usually 2,240\u00a0lb.\nIn the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and other areas that had used the imperial system, the tonne is the form of ton legal in trade.\nUnits of volume.\nThe displacement, essentially the weight, of a ship is traditionally expressed in long tons. To simplify measurement it is determined by measuring the volume, rather than weight, of water displaced, and calculating the weight from the volume and density.\nFor practical purposes the displacement ton (DT) is a unit of volume, , the approximate volume occupied by one ton of seawater (the actual volume varies with salinity and temperature). It is slightly less than the 224 imperial gallons (1.018\u00a0m3) of the water ton (based on distilled water).\nOne measurement ton or freight ton is equal to , but historically it has had several different definitions. It is used to determine the amount of money to be charged in loading, unloading, or carrying different sorts of cargo. In general if a cargo is heavier than salt water, the actual weight is used.

Early versions of talk did not separate text from each user. Thus, if each user were to type simultaneously, characters from each user were intermingled. Since slow teleprinter keyboards were used at the time (11 characters per second maximum), users often could not wait for each other to finish. It was common etiquette for a long typing user to stop when intermingling occurred to see the listener's interrupting response. This is much the same as interrupting a long monologue when speaking in person. More modern versions use curses to break the terminal into multiple zones for each user, thus avoiding intermingling text.\nIn 1983, a new version of talk was introduced as a Unix command with 4.2BSD, and would also accommodate electronic conversations between users on different machines. Follow-ons to talk included codice_2, Britt Yenne's codice_3 and Roger Espel Llima's codice_4. ytalk was the first of these to allow conversations between more than two users, and was written in part to allow communication between users on computers with different endianness. utalk uses a special protocol over UDP (instead of TCP used by the rest) that is more efficient and allows edition of the entire screen. All of these programs split the interface into different sections for each participant. The interfaces did not convey the order in which statements typed by different participants would be reassembled into a log of the conversation. Also, all three programs are real-time text, where they transmit each character as it was typed. This leads to a more immediate feel to the discussion than recent instant messaging clients or IRC. Users more familiar with other forms of instant text communication would sometimes find themselves in embarrassing situations by typing something and deciding to withdraw the statement, unaware that other participants of the conversation had seen every keystroke happen in real time.\nA similar program exists on VMS systems called codice_5.\nSecurity.\nA popular program called \"flash\", which sent malformed information via the talk protocol, was frequently used by pranksters to corrupt the terminal output of the unlucky target in the early 1990s. It did this by including terminal commands in the field normally designated for providing the name of the person making the request. When the victim would receive the talk request, the name of the person sending the request would be displayed on their screen. This would cause the terminal commands to execute, rendering the person's display unreadable until they reset it. Later versions of talk blocked flash attempts and alerted the user that one had taken place. Later it became clear that, by sending different terminal commands, it is even possible to have the user execute commands. As it has proven impossible to fix all programs that output untrusted data to the terminal, modern terminal emulators have been rewritten to block this attack, though some may still be vulnerable.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "30320", "revid": "49832518", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30320", "title": "Sex Pistols", "text": "English punk rock band\nThe Sex Pistols are an English punk rock band formed in London in 1975. Although their initial career lasted just two and a half years, they became culturally influential in popular music. The band initiated the punk movement in the United Kingdom, with their clothes and hairstyles becoming a significant influence on the punk subculture and fashion. On 4 June and 20 July 1976, their performances at Manchester's Lesser Free Trade Hall inspired future members of bands such as Joy Division, New Order, the Smiths, the Fall, Simply Red, Magazine and Buzzcocks to pursue music, as well as Martin Hannett, Tony Wilson and Alan McGee, the founders of Factory and Creation Records, who later contributed to the development of England's independent music scene, and several post-punk, indie, and alternative rock artists.\nThe Sex Pistols' first line-up consisted of vocalist Johnny Rotten (byname of John Lydon), guitarist Steve Jones, drummer Paul Cook, and bassist Glen Matlock, with Matlock replaced by Sid Vicious in early 1977. Under the management of Malcolm McLaren, the band gained widespread attention from British press after swearing live on-air during a December 1976 television interview. Their May 1977 single \"God Save the Queen\", which described the monarchy as a \"fascist regime\", was released to coincide with national celebrations for the Queen's Silver Jubilee. The song was promptly banned from being played by the BBC and by nearly every independent radio station in Britain, making it the most censored record in British history.\nTheir sole studio album \"Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols\" (1977) was a UK number one and is regarded as seminal in the development of punk rock. In January 1978, at the final gig of a difficult and media-hyped tour of the US, Rotten announced the band's break-up live on stage. Over the next few months, the three remaining members recorded songs for McLaren's film of the Sex Pistols' story, \"The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle\". Vicious died of a heroin overdose in February 1979 following his arrest for the alleged murder of his girlfriend, Nancy Spungen. Rotten, Jones, Cook and Matlock later reunited for a successful tour in 1996. Further one-off performances and short tours followed over the next decade. In 2024, Jones, Cook, Matlock, and guest vocalist Frank Carter, reformed the Sex Pistols to play a series of shows that year, with further dates scheduled for 2025.\nThe Sex Pistols have been recognised as a highly influential band. In 2006, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame although, true to their image, they refused to attend the ceremony, with Rotten referring to the museum as \"a piss stain\".\nHistory.\nFormation.\nThe Sex Pistols evolved from the Strand (sometimes known as the Swankers), formed in London in 1972 by teenagers Steve Jones on vocals, Paul Cook on drums and Wally Nightingale on guitar. According to Jones, both he and Cook played on instruments he had stolen. The band regularly hung out at two clothing shops on the King's Road in Chelsea, London: John Krivine and Steph Raynor's Acme Attractions and Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood's Too Fast to Live, Too Young to Die. McLaren's and Westwood's shop had opened in 1971 as Let It Rock, with a 1950s revival Teddy Boy theme. It had been renamed in 1972 to focus on another revival trend, the '50s rocker look. The shop then became a focal point of the early London punk rock scene, bringing together participants such as the future Sid Vicious, Marco Pirroni, Gene October, and Mark Stewart. Jordan, the wildly styled shop assistant, is credited with \"pretty well single-handedly paving the punk look\".\nIn late 1974, Jones asked McLaren to take over the band's management. Glen Matlock, an art student who occasionally worked at McLaren's and Westwood's shop, joined as bassist. McLaren and Westwood conceived a new identity for their shop: renamed Sex, it changed its focus away from retro 1950s couture to S&amp;M-inspired \"anti-fashion\". After managing and promoting the New York Dolls, McLaren returned to London in May 1975 and began to take more of an interest in the Strand.\nThe group had been rehearsing regularly, overseen by Bernard Rhodes (who would later go on to manage the Clash) and performing live. Soon after McLaren's return, Nightingale was dismissed and Jones, uncomfortable as frontman, took over guitar. McLaren had been talking with the New York Dolls' Sylvain Sylvain about coming over to England to front the group. When those plans fell through, McLaren, Rhodes and the band began looking locally for a new member to assume the lead vocal duties. As described by Matlock, \"Everyone had long hair back then, even the milkman, so what we used to do was if someone had short hair we would stop them in the street and ask them if they fancied themselves as a singer\". For instance, Midge Ure, the later front man of Rich Kids (with Matlock) and Ultravox, claims to have been approached, but refused the offer. With the search for a lead singer proving fruitless, McLaren made several calls to Richard Hell, who also turned down the invitation.\nLydon joins.\nDescribing the social context in which the band formed, John Lydon said that mid-seventies Britain was \"a very depressing place... completely run-down, there was trash on the streets, total unemployment, just about everybody was on strike... if you came from the wrong side of the tracks... then you had no hope in hell and no career prospects at all.\"\nIn August 1975, Rhodes spotted Lydon, then 19 years old, wearing a Pink Floyd T-shirt with the words 'I Hate' handwritten above the band's name and holes scratched through the Floyd members' eyes. Soon after, either Rhodes or McLaren asked Lydon to audition. During the session, Lydon improvised to Alice Cooper's \"I'm Eighteen\" on the Sex jukebox. According to Jones, \"he came in with green hair. I thought he had a really interesting face. I liked his look. He had the 'I Hate Pink Floyd' T-shirt on...held together with safety pins... he was a real arsehole\u2014but smart.\" Jones renamed Lydon as \"Johnny Rotten\" as a joke, apparently because of his particularly bad teeth.\nCook had a full-time job and was threatening to quit the band. \"New Musical Express\" journalist Nick Kent occasionally played second guitar with the band before Lydon joined. An advertisement was placed in \"Melody Maker\" looking for a \"whizz kid guitarist\u00a0... not older than 20\u00a0... not worse looking than Johnny Thunders.\" As Steve New was the most talented guitarist to audition, he was asked to join. However, Jones' playing had greatly improved, and New left a month after joining the band.\nAfter considering band name options such as Le Bomb, Subterraneans, the Damned, Beyond, Teenage Novel, Kid Gladlove, and Cr\u00e8me de la Cr\u00e8me, they decided on Sex Pistols. Matlock said the band decided on the name while McLaren was in the United States before Rotten joined. Jon Savage says the name was not firmly settled on until just before their first show in November 1975. McLaren later said the name derived \"from the idea of a pistol, a pin-up, a young thing, a better-looking assassin\". Not given to modesty, false or otherwise, he added: \"[I] launched the idea in the form of a band of kids who could be perceived as being bad.\" The group began writing original material: Rotten was the lyricist and Matlock the primary melody writer (though their first collaboration, \"Pretty Vacant\", had all lyrics by Matlock, which Rotten tweaked a bit); official credit was shared equally among the four.\nTheir first gig was arranged by Matlock, then studying at Saint Martin's School of Art. The band played at the school in November 1975, supporting the pub rock group Bazooka Joe. They performed several covers including the Who's \"Substitute\", the Small Faces' \"Whatcha Gonna Do About It\", and the Monkees' \"(I'm Not Your) Steppin' Stone\".\nEarly following.\nThe Saint Martins gig was followed by performances at colleges around London. The band's core early followers\u2014including Siouxsie Sioux, Steven Severin and Billy Idol, Jordan, and Soo Catwoman\u2014came to be known as the Bromley Contingent, after the suburban south-east London borough that several of them were from. Their cutting-edge fashion, much of it supplied by Sex, ignited a trend that was adopted by the new fans the band attracted. McLaren and Westwood saw the incipient London punk movement as a vehicle for more than just couture. They were influenced by the May 1968 radical uprising in Paris, particularly by the ideology and agitations of the Situationists. These interests were shared with Jamie Reid, a friend of McLaren who took over the design of the band's visual imagery in the spring of 1976. His cut-up lettering\u2014based on notes left by kidnappers or terrorists\u2014were used to create the classic Sex Pistols logo and many subsequent designs for the band, although they were actually introduced by McLaren's friend Helen Wellington-Lloyd. Reid has said that he used \"to talk to John [Lydon] a lot about the Situationists... the Sex Pistols seemed the perfect vehicle to communicate ideas directly to people who weren't getting the message from left-wing politics\". McLaren was also arranging for the band's first photo sessions. According to the writer Jon Savage, Lydon \"with his green hair, hunched stance and ragged look...[Lydon] looked like a cross between Uriah Heep and Richard Hell\".\nTheir first gig to attract attention was as a supporting act for Eddie and the Hot Rods, a leading pub rock group, at the Marquee in February 1976. The band's first review appeared in the \"NME\", accompanied by a brief interview in which Jones declared, \"Actually we're not into music. We're into chaos.\" Among those who read the article were two students at the Bolton Institute of Technology, Howard Devoto and Pete Shelley, who headed down to London in search of the Sex Pistols. After chatting with McLaren at Sex, they saw the band at a couple of late February gigs. The two friends immediately began organising their own Pistols-style group, Buzzcocks. As Devoto later put it, \"My life changed the moment that I saw the Sex Pistols.\"\nThe Pistols soon played other important venues, notably playing at Oxford Street's 100 Club for the first time on 30 March. On 3 April, they played for the first time at the Nashville, supporting the 101ers. The pub rock group's lead singer, Joe Strummer, saw the Pistols for the first time that night\u2014and recognised punk rock as the future. A return gig at the Nashville on 23 April highlighted the band's growing musical competence. However Westwood started a fight with another audience member which also dragged in McLaren and Rotten. Cook later said, the \"fight at the Nashville: that's when all the publicity got hold of it and the violence started creeping in... I think everybody was ready to go and we were the catalyst.\"\nThe leading New York punk band, the Ramones, released their debut album on 23 April 1976. Although regarded as seminal to the growth of English punk rock, with Cook and Jones being fans of the album, Lydon has repeatedly rejected that it influenced the Sex Pistols, claiming that they \"were all long-haired and of no interest to me. I didn't like their image, what they stood for, or anything about them\".\n Cook also denied being influenced by their music, stating, \"the Ramones and the Pistols were different animals, with a different flavour. They were more basic, three-chord rock\u2019n\u2019roll\", but added that the release of the album made the Pistols think, \"We\u2019d better crack on here.\u201dOn 11 May, the Pistols began a four-week Tuesday night residency at the 100 Club. They devoted the rest of the month to touring small cities and towns in the north of England and recording demos in London with producer and recording artist Chris Spedding. The following month they played their first gig in Manchester, arranged by Devoto and Shelley. The Sex Pistols' 4 June performance at the Lesser Free Trade Hall set off a punk rock boom in the city.\nOn 4 and 6 July, respectively, two newly formed London punk rock acts\u2014the Clash, with Strummer as lead vocalist, and the Damned\u2014made their live debuts opening for the Sex Pistols. On their off-night on the 5th, the Pistols attended a Ramones gig at Dingwalls, like virtually everyone else at the centre of the early London punk scene. During a return Manchester gig on 20 July, the Pistols premiered a new song, \"Anarchy in the U.K.\", reflecting elements of the radical ideologies to which Rotten was being exposed. According to Savage, \"there seems little doubt that Lydon was fed material by Vivienne Westwood and Jamie Reid, which he then converted into his own lyric\".\n\"Anarchy in the U.K.\" was among the seven original songs recorded in a demo session overseen by the band's sound engineer, Dave Goodman. McLaren organised a major event for 29 August at The Screen on the Green in London's Islington district, with the Buzzcocks and the Clash opening for the Pistols. Three days later, the band were in Manchester to tape their first television appearance, for Tony Wilson's \"So It Goes\". The Pistols played their first gig outside Britain on 3 September, at the opening of the Chalet du Lac disco in Paris. The Bromley Contingent were in attendance and Siouxsie was harassed by locals due to her outfit with bare breasts. The following day, the \"So It Goes\" performance aired. On 13 September, the Pistols began a tour of Britain. A week later, back in London, they headlined the opening night of the 100 Club Punk Special. Organised by McLaren (for whom the word \"festival\" had too much of a hippie connotation), the event was \"considered the moment that was the catalyst for the years to come\". Belying the common perception that punk bands couldn't play their instruments, contemporary music press reviews, later critical assessments of concert recordings, and testimonials by fellow musicians indicate that the Pistols had developed into a tight, ferocious live band. As Rotten tested out wild vocalisation styles, the instrumentalists experimented \"with overload, feedback and distortion... pushing their equipment to the limit\".\nMainstream fame.\nThe record label EMI signed the band on a two-year contract on 8 October 1976. The Pistols were soon in a studio recording a full-dress session with Dave Goodman. According to Matlock, \"The idea was to get the spirit of the live performance. We were pressurized to make it faster and faster.\" The results were rejected by the band. Chris Thomas, who had produced Roxy Music and mixed Pink Floyd's \"The Dark Side of the Moon\", was brought in to produce. The band's first single, \"Anarchy in the U.K.\", was released on 26 November 1976. The musician and journalist John Robb later described the record's impact: \"From Steve Jones' opening... descending chords, to Johnny Rotten's... sneering vocals, this song is the perfect statement... a stunningly powerful piece of punk politics.\" Colin Newman of the early post-punk band Wire, described it as \"the clarion call of a generation\".\nThe lyrics of \"Anarchy in the U.K.\" linked punk to a newly politicised and nihilistic attitude, typified by phrases such as \"I am an anti-Christ\" and \"Destroy!\". The single's packaging and visual promotion also broke new ground. Reid and McLaren came up with the idea of selling the record in a completely wordless, featureless black sleeve. The primary image associated with the single was Reid's \"anarchy flag\" poster: a ripped up and partly safety-pinned back together Union Flag, with the song and band names clipped across the middle. These and other of Reid's images for the band quickly became punk iconography.\nThe Pistols' behaviour as much as their music attracted national media attention. On 1 December 1976, the band, accompanied by members of the Bromley Contingent, repeatedly swore during an early evening live broadcast of Thames Television's \"Today\" programme, hosted by Bill Grundy. Appearing as last-minute replacements for Queen, the band and their entourage were offered drinks as they waited to go on air. During the interview, encouraged by Grundy, Jones said the band had \"fucking spent\" its label advance, and Rotten used the word \"shit\". Grundy\u2014who later claimed to have been drunk\u2014then attempted to flirt with Siouxsie Sioux, who replied that she had \"always wanted to meet\" him. Grundy responded, \"Did you really? We'll meet afterwards, shall we?\", prompting Jones to repeatedly swear.\nAlthough the programme was only broadcast in the London region, the ensuing media coverage occupied the tabloid newspapers for days. The \"Daily Mirror\" famously ran the headline \"The Filth and the Fury!\", and asked \"Who are these punks?\"; other papers such as the \"Daily Express\" (\"Fury at Filthy TV Chat\") and the \"Daily Telegraph\" (\"4-Letter Words Rock TV\") followed suit. Thames Television suspended Grundy and the interview effectively ended his career. Steve Jones reflected; Grundy was the big dividing line in the Sex Pistols' story. Before it, we were all about the music, but from then on it was all about the media. In some ways it was our finest moment, but in others it was the beginning of the end... In terms of the Sex Pistols having any kind of long-term future, this sudden acceleration was the worst thing that could possibly have happened.\nThe interview made the band a household name overnight in Britain and brought punk into the mainstream. They launched the UK Anarchy Tour, supported by the Clash and Johnny Thunders' band the Heartbreakers, over from New York. The Damned were briefly part of the tour, before McLaren kicked them off. Media coverage was intense, and many of the concerts were cancelled by organisers or local authorities; of approximately twenty scheduled gigs, only about seven actually took place. Following a campaign in the south Wales press, a crowd including carol singers and a Pentecostal preacher, protested against the group outside a show in Caerphilly. Packers at the EMI plant refused to handle the band's single. London Conservative councillor Bernard Brook Partridge said, \"Most of these groups would be vastly improved by sudden death. The worst of the punk rock groups I suppose currently are the Sex Pistols. They are unbelievably nauseating... the antithesis of humankind. I would like to see somebody dig a very, very large, exceedingly deep hole and drop the whole bloody lot down it.\"\nThree concerts were arranged in the Netherlands for January 1977. The band, hungover, boarded a plane at London Heathrow Airport early on 4 January; a few hours later, the \"Evening News\" was reporting that the band had \"vomited and spat their way\" to the flight. Despite categorical denials by the EMI representative who accompanied the group, the label, which was under political pressure, released the band from their contract. In one journalist's later description, the Pistols had \"stoked a moral panic... precipitating the cancellation of gigs, the band's expulsion from their EMI record deal and lurid tabloid tales of punk's 'shock cult'\". As McLaren fielded offers from other labels, the band went into the studio for a round of recordings with Goodman, their last with either him or Matlock.\nSid Vicious replaces Matlock.\nOn 28 February 1977 McLaren announced Matlock was leaving the band because Matlock \"went on too long about Paul McCartney.\" Although Matlock says he left voluntarily, Jones claimed in a contemporary interview that he was sacked because he \"liked the Beatles\". In 2005, Jones admitted that although Matlock was a good songwriter, he \"didn't look like a Sex Pistol\". In 1990, Matlock described the reason as his bitter relationship with Rotten, exacerbated\u2014in Matlock's account\u2014by Rotten's attitude \"once he'd had his name in the papers\". Jon Savage suggests that Rotten pushed Matlock out to demonstrate his power and autonomy from McLaren.\nMatlock was replaced by Rotten's friend Sid Vicious, previously the drummer of two inner circle punk bands, Siouxsie and the Banshees and the Flowers of Romance. According to Matlock, Rotten wanted Vicious in the band because \"[i]nstead of him against Steve and Paul, it would become him and Sid against Steve and Paul. He always thought of it in terms of opposing camps.\" According to Jones, \"to Cookie [Paul Cook] and me, it just didn't make any sense to have someone who couldn't play a note trying to fill Glen's shoes, but it was never about the music for McLaren... from the minute Sid joined the band, nothing was ever normal again.\"\nJulien Temple, then a film student McLaren had employed to create a comprehensive audiovisual record of the band, agrees: \"Sid was John's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in the group, really. The other two just thought he was crazy.\" McLaren later stated that, much earlier in the band's career, Westwood had told him he should \"get the guy called John [Sid Vicious] who came to the store a couple of times\" to be the singer. When Lydon was recruited, Westwood said McLaren had recruited \"the wrong John\".\nVicious was arrested after hurling a glass that shattered and blinded a girl in one eye at a Damned gig at the 100 Club Punk Special. He served time in a remand centre and the incident contributed to the 100 Club banning punk bands. He assaulted Nick Kent with a bicycle chain during a gig at the 100 Club. According to McLaren, \"when Sid joined he couldn't play guitar but his craziness fitted into the structure of the band.\" \"Everyone agreed he had the look,\" Lydon later recalled, but musical skill was another matter. \"The first rehearsals... with Sid were hellish\". In the music documentary, \"Punk Attitude\", Chrissie Hynde remarked that Vicious learned to play bass by staying up for 3 nights on speed playing along to the Ramones first album \"Ramones\",Marco Pirroni, who had performed with Vicious in Siouxsie and the Banshees, has said, \"After that, it was nothing to do with music anymore. It would just be for the sensationalism and scandal of it all. Then it became the Malcolm McLaren story\".\nBeing in the Pistols had a progressively destructive effect on Vicious. As Lydon observed, \"Up to that time, Sid was absolutely childlike. Everything was fun and giggly. Suddenly he was a big pop star. Pop star status meant press, a good chance to be spotted in all the right places, adoration.\" Early in 1977, he met Nancy Spungen. Spungen introduced Vicious to heroin, and their emotional codependency alienated him from the other band members. Lydon later wrote, \"we did everything to get rid of Nancy... She was killing him. I was absolutely convinced this girl was on a slow suicide mission... She wanted to take Sid with her.\"\nA&amp;M, Virgin, and Jubilee week.\nThe Pistols signed to A&amp;M Records at a March 1977 press ceremony held outside Buckingham Palace. Afterwards, intoxicated, they went to the A&amp;M offices where Vicious reportedly broke a toilet bowl and Rotten verbally abused members of the label's staff. A couple of days later, the Pistols got into a fight with another band at a club; one of Rotten's friends threatened a friend of A&amp;M's English director; A&amp;M broke their contract with the Pistols on 16 March. Although 25,000 copies of the \"God Save the Queen\" single had already been pressed, nearly all were destroyed. \nVicious first performed with the Pistols at London's Notre Dame Hall on 28 March. That May, the Pistols signed with Virgin Records, their third label in little more than half a year. During Virgin's release campaign for \"God Save the Queen\", workers at the pressing plant laid down tools in protest at the song's lyrics and Reid's cover art of Queen Elizabeth II with her face obscured by cutout letters forming the song title and the band name. The single was eventually released on 27 May. Its lyrics\u2013\"God save the queen / the fascist regime..She ain't no human being / and there's no future / in England's dreaming\"\u2013lead to widespread outcry from the British tabloids, leading to several major chains withdrawing it from sale. It was banned by BBC radio and television and every independent radio station, making it, according to the music critic Alexis Petridis, the \"most heavily censored record in British history\". The song's social impact has been described by the musician and journalist Sean O'Hagan as \"punk's crowning glory\".\nThe single was timed to coincide with the height of Queen Elizabeth's Silver Jubilee celebrations. By Jubilee weekend, a week and a half after the record's release, it had sold more than 150,000 copies. On 7 June, McLaren chartered a boat to have the Sex Pistols perform while sailing the River Thames, passing Westminster Pier and the Houses of Parliament. The event was conceived as a mockery of the Queen's river procession planned for two days later, but ended in chaos. Police launches forced the boat to dock, and constabulary surrounded the gangplanks at the pier. While the band members and their equipment were hustled down a side stairwell, McLaren, Westwood, and many of the band's entourage were arrested. \n\"God Save the Queen\" opened at number 2 on the official UK record chart for Jubilee week, behind Rod Stewart's \"I Don't Want to Talk About It\". McLaren claimed that CBS Records, who distributed both singles, told him that the Pistols were outselling Stewart two to one. There is evidence that exceptional measures were taken by the British Phonographic Institute, which oversaw the compilation of the UK chart, to exclude sales from Virgin's shops.\nAttacks on punk fans rose and in mid-June, Rotten was assaulted by a knife-wielding gang outside Islington's Pegasus pub, causing tendon damage to his left arm. Reid and Cook were beaten up in other incidents; three days after the Pegasus assault, Rotten was attacked again. According to Cook, after the \"God Save the Queen\" single and the Grundy incident, the Pistols were public enemy number one, and there was a rivalry between gangs of rockabillies, Teddy Boys and punks, which often led to violence. By that August the band were unable to publicise UK dates, forcing them to tour pseudonymously as the SPOTS (Sex Pistols on Tour Secretly) to avoid cancellation.\nMcLaren had long wanted to make a movie featuring the Sex Pistols. Temple's first task was to assemble \"Sex Pistols Number 1\", a 25-minute mosaic of footage from various sources, much of it refilmed from television screens. \"Number 1\" was often screened at concert venues before the band took stage. Using media footage from the Thames incident, Temple created another short, \"Jubilee Riverboat\" (aka \"Sex Pistols Number 2\").\nNever Mind the Bollocks.\nBeginning in early 1977, Lydon, Jones and Cook began to record tracks for their debut album with producer Chris Thomas. Initially titled \"God Save Sex Pistols\", it became known during the summer as \"Never Mind the Bollocks\". Vicious's lack of musical ability became apparent soon after he joined the sessions; according to Jones they \"tried as hard as possible not to let [Vicious] anywhere near the studio\". Although Matlock was asked to return as a session musician, Jones ultimately played most of the bass parts. Vicious's bass is reportedly present on \"Bodies\": According to Jones, \"we just let him do it. When he left I dubbed another part on, leaving Sid's down low.\" Jones says that Vicious showed up for the \"God Save the Queen\" session, while Lydon remembers him being there during the recording of an unused version of \"Submission\". Two further singles were released from the Thomas sessions; \"Pretty Vacant\" on 1 July and \"Holidays in the Sun\" on 14 October. Each was a top-ten hit.\nThe album was released on 28 October 1977. \"Rolling Stone\" described it as \"the most exciting rock &amp; roll record of the Seventies\". Some critics were disappointed that the album contained all four previously released singles, and dismissed it as little more than a \"greatest hits\" compilation.\nContaining the track \"Bodies\"\u2014in which Rotten says \"fuck\" six times\u2014and \"God Save the Queen\", and featuring the word \"bollocks\" in its title, the album was banned by Boots, WHSmith and Woolworths. The Conservative shadow minister for education condemned it as \"a symptom of the way society is declining\", and both the Independent Television Companies Association and Association of Independent Radio Contractors banned its advertisements. Nonetheless, advance sales were sufficient to make it number one on the album chart.\nThe album title led to a high-profile legal case after a Nottingham Virgin Records store was threatened with prosecution for displaying \"indecent printed matter\". The case was thrown out when defending QC John Mortimer produced an expert witness who established that \"bollocks\" was an Old English term for a small ball, that the word appeared in place names without causing local communities erotic disturbance, and that in the nineteenth century \"bollocks\" had been used as a nickname for clergymen: \"Clergymen are known to talk a good deal of rubbish and so the word later developed the meaning of nonsense.\" In the context of the album title, the term does in fact primarily signify \"nonsense\". Steve Jones off-handedly came up with the title as the band debated what to call the album. An exasperated Jones said, \"Oh, fuck it, never mind the bollocks of it all.\"\nAfter dates in the Netherlands, the band set out on a Never Mind the Bans tour of Britain in December 1977. Of eight scheduled dates, four were cancelled due to illness or political pressure. On Christmas Day, the Pistols played two shows at Ivanhoe's in Huddersfield, the first show being for the children of striking firemen. These were the band's final UK performances for more than eighteen years.\nThe Pistols January 1978 US tour was initially scheduled for nine dates, but due to Vicious's drug use and the breakdown in the relationship between Lydon and McLaren was cut short after seven shows. It was delayed due to American authorities' reluctance to issue a visa to Jones, given his criminal record, leading to the cancellation of several dates in the Northeast. Although the tour had been highly anticipated in the US, it was plagued by in-fighting and poor planning, leading to frustrated and belligerent audiences.\nEarly in the tour, Vicious was arrested while trying to buy heroin in Memphis and beaten by the security team hired by Warner Bros., the band's American label. He subsequently appeared with the words \"Gimme a fix\" scarred on his chest. During a concert in San Antonio, Vicious had a back and forth verbal altercation with a man in the crowd, Vicious shouted \"You faggot little fucker\" before swinging his bass guitar into the crowd and having the man kicked out of the concert. Suffering from heroin withdrawal during a show in Dallas, he spat blood at a woman who climbed onstage and punched him in the face. He was admitted to hospital later that night to treat various injuries. Offstage he is said to have kicked a photographer, attacked a security guard, and challenged one of his own bodyguards to a fight.\nRotten was suffering flu and coughing up blood, and he felt increasingly isolated from Cook and Jones and disgusted by Vicious. Jones later said that he and Cook \"couldn't stand being around Johnny and Sid anymore. You couldn't turn round for a minute without Sid starting a fight... Then on top of that you had Rotten, who was on his own trip and basically thought he was God by that stage.\"\nOn 14 January 1978, during the tour's final date at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco, a disillusioned Rotten introduced the band's encore saying, \"You'll get one number and one number only 'cause I'm a lazy bastard.\" That one number was a Stooges cover, \"No Fun\". At the end of the song, Rotten, kneeling on the stage, chanted an unambiguous declaration, \"This is no fun. No fun. This is no fun\u2014at all. No fun.\" As the final cymbal crash died away, Rotten addressed the audience directly\u2014\"Ah-ha-ha. Ever get the feeling you've been cheated? Good night\"\u2014before throwing down his microphone and walking offstage. He later observed, \"I felt cheated, and I wasn't going on with it any longer; it was a ridiculous farce. Sid was completely out of his brains\u2014just a waste of space. The whole thing was a joke at that point... [Malcolm] wouldn't speak to me... He would not discuss anything with me. But then he would turn around and tell Paul and Steve that the tension was all my fault because I wouldn't agree to anything.\"\nOn 17 January the band travelled separately to Los Angeles. Vicious, in increasingly bad shape, was brought by a friend who then took him to New York; Vicious took a mixture of valium and methadone (later excused as \"nervous exhaustion\") and was hospitalised on arrival. Rotten flew to New York to visit Vicious, and announced the band's break-up on 18 January. Virtually broke, he telephoned the head of Virgin Records, Richard Branson, who agreed to pay for his flight back to London.\nPost-Lydon phase and initial breakup.\nCook, Jones and Vicious did not play live together again after Rotten's departure. Over the next several months, McLaren arranged for recordings in Brazil (with Jones and Cook), Paris (with Vicious) and London; they and others stepped in as lead vocalists on tracks. On 30 June, a single was released: on one side, notorious criminal Ronnie Biggs sang \"No One Is Innocent\" accompanied by Jones and Cook; on the other, Vicious sang the classic \"My Way\", over both a Jones\u2013Cook backing track and a string orchestra. The single charted at number seven.\nVicious moved to New York, where he attempted to launch a career as a solo artist with Spungen as his manager. In September 1978, backed by members of the New York Dolls, Vicious recorded songs eventually released on his posthumous 1979 live album \"Sid Sings\". On 12 October 1978, Spungen was found dead aged 20 in the Hotel Chelsea room she was sharing with Vicious, from a stab wound to her stomach. Police recovered drug paraphernalia from the scene and Vicious was arrested and charged with her murder. While on bail, Vicious was arrested for smashing a beer mug in the face of Patti Smith's brother Todd Smith. Vicious was taken into custody on 9 December 1978 and spent the next 54 days in Rikers Island jail, where he underwent enforced cold turkey detox. He was released on bail on 1 February 1979. Later that night, following a small party to celebrate his release, he died of a heroin overdose, aged 21.\nCook and Jones continued to work together, with two new tracks they'd recorded, \"Black Leather\" and \"Here We Go Again\", appearing on the Japanese compilation \"The Very Best Of Sex Pistols And We Don't Care\" in December 1979, Other new songs appeared on \"The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle\", a soundtrack album for a then-uncompleted film about the Sex Pistols. The album was released by Virgin Records in February 1979, and consisted mostly of cover songs and new tracks sung by Jones, Vicious, Cook, Biggs, McLaren and Edward Tudor-Pole. Several tracks feature Rotten's vocals from early unissued sessions, in some cases with re-recorded music by Jones and Cook. There is one live cut, from the band's final concert in San Francisco. The album also contains tracks in which other artists cover Sex Pistols songs. Four songs from \"Swindle\" became top ten singles, one more than from \"Never Mind the Bollocks\". The 1978 \"No One Is Innocent\"/\"My Way\" single was followed in 1979 by the Vicious-sung cover of Eddie Cochran's \"Something Else\" (number three, and the biggest-selling single under the Sex Pistols name); Jones singing an original, \"Silly Thing\" (number six); and Vicious's second Cochran cover, \"C'mon Everybody\" (number three). Two more singles from the soundtrack were put out under the Sex Pistols name, with Tudor-Pole and others singing \"The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle\", and \"(I'm Not Your) Steppin' Stone\", which featured a Rotten vocal from 1976, ; both fell just shy of the Top Twenty.\nMeanwhile, Lydon initiated legal proceedings against McLaren and the Pistols' management company, Glitterbest, which McLaren controlled. Among the claims were non-payment of royalties, improper usage of the title \"Johnny Rotten\", unfair contractual obligations and damages for \"all the criminal activities that took place\". Hearings began on 7 February 1979, five days after Vicious's death. Cook and Jones allied with McLaren, but as evidence mounted that their manager had spent virtually all of the band's revenue on his film project, they switched sides. On 14 February, the court put the film and its soundtrack into receivership\u2014no longer under McLaren's control, they were now to be administered as exploitable assets for addressing the band members' financial claims. McLaren was left with substantial personal debts and legal fees.\nAftermath.\nAfter leaving the Pistols, Rotten reverted to his birth name of Lydon and formed the influential post-punk band Public Image Ltd with former Clash member Keith Levene and school friend Jah Wobble. The band scored a UK top-ten hit with their debut single, 1978's \"Public Image\". \nFollowing their fall out with McLaren, Cook and Jones formed the Professionals, which lasted from 1979-1982. Jones went on to play with the bands Chequered Past and Neurotic Outsiders. He also recorded two solo albums, \"Mercy\" and \"Fire and Gasoline\". As of 2017, Jones lives in Los Angeles, where he has hosted a daily radio programme, \"Jonesy's Jukebox\", since 2015. Since the Rich Kids' break-up in 1979, Matlock has played with various bands, including recording and touring with Iggy Pop in 1980.\nMcLaren went on to carry out a one-month consultancy for Adam and the Ants and manage their offshoot Bow Wow Wow. In the mid-1980s he released a series of successful and influential records as a solo artist.\n\"The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle\" film was eventually completed by Julien Temple, who received sole credit for the script after McLaren had his name taken off the production. Released in 1980, it heavily reflects McLaren's vision. It is a fictionalised and partially animated retelling of the band's history and aftermath with McLaren in the lead role, Jones as second lead, and contributions from Vicious (including his memorable performance of \"My Way\") and Cook. It incorporates promotional videos shot for \"God Save the Queen\" and \"Pretty Vacant\" and extensive documentary footage as well, much of it focusing on Rotten. In Temple's description, he and McLaren conceived it as a \"very stylized... polemic\". They were reacting to the fact that the Pistols had become the \"poster on the bedroom wall of the day where you kneel down last thing at night and pray to your rock god. And that was never the point... The myth had to be dynamited in some way. We had to make this film in a way to enrage the fans.\" In the film, McLaren claims to have created the band from scratch and engineered its notorious reputation; much of what structure the loose narrative has is based on McLaren's teaching a series of \"lessons\" to be learned from \"an invention of mine they called the punk rock\".\nThe 1979 court ruling left many issues between Lydon and McLaren unresolved. Five years later, Lydon filed another action. Finally, on 16 January 1986, Lydon, Jones, Cook and the estate of Sid Vicious were awarded control of the band's heritage, including the rights to \"The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle\" and all the footage shot for it\u2014more than 250 hours. That same year, the fictionalised film of Vicious's relationship with Spungen was released: \"Sid and Nancy\", directed by Alex Cox. In his autobiography, Lydon attacked the film, saying that it \"celebrates heroin addiction\", goes out of its way to \"humiliate [Vicious's] life\" and completely misrepresents the Sex Pistols' part in the London punk scene.\nIn May 2022 FX released the miniseries \"Pistol\" about the band.\nReunions.\nThe original band members reunited in 1996 for the six-month Filthy Lucre tour, which included dates in Europe, North and South America, Australia and Japan. Their access to the archives associated with \"The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle\" facilitated the production of the 2000 documentary \"The Filth and the Fury\". The film was also directed by Temple and formulated as an attempt to tell the story from the band's point of view, in contrast to \"Swindle\"'s focus on McLaren and the media. In 2002 the band reunited to play the Crystal Palace National Sports Centre in London. They undertook a short tour of North America in 2003.\nIn March 2006, the band sold the rights to their back catalogue to Universal Music Group. In November 2006, the Sex Pistols were inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but the band rejected the honour. According to Jones, \"once you want to be put into a museum, Rock &amp; Roll's over; it's not voted by fans, it's voted by people who induct you\u00a0... people who are already in it.\"\nThe Pistols reunited for seven performances in the UK in November 2007. In 2008, they undertook a series of European festival appearances, titled the Combine Harvester Tour. That same year, they released the DVD \"There'll Always Be An England\", recorded at their Brixton Academy appearance on 10 November 2007. The band signed with Universal in 2012 to re-release \"Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols\".\nOn 3 June 2024, Cook, Jones, and Matlock announced two reunion shows at the Bush Hall in Shepherds Bush billed as \"Frank Carter and Sex Pistols\". Carter, of Frank Carter &amp; The Rattlesnakes and Gallows, provided lead vocals in the absence of Lydon. They played the sole Sex Pistols studio album \"Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols\" in its entirety. On 25 August they headlined along with Editors, the 2024 AMA Music Festival. A UK tour was later announced for September 2024, which was officially billed as \"Frank Carter and Paul Cook, Steve Jones, Glen Matlock of the Sex Pistols do Never Mind the Bollocks\". On 20 September they played the Rock City venue in Nottingham, the next day the Birmingham o2 Academy and on 26 September they played in London, Kentish Town. On 12 November 2024, they were announced as part of the 2025 Download Festival lineup. In January 2025, they announced their first Australian tour since 1996, which took place in April.\nMusical style.\nThe Sex Pistols were a punk rock band. According to Mark Deming of AllMusic, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"The Sex Pistols' music was not formally groundbreaking, yet their simple meat-and-potatoes rock was filled with a power and aggression that was all but unknown in the mid-'70s, and the ferocious, sneering vocals of Johnny Rotten (as well as his pointed, accusatory lyrics) upended all expectations of how a rock frontman should look or sound. Even as the media treated them as pariahs, the potency of their music and their image spoke to an audience waiting for something different than the prog and soft rock sounds that ruled the charts in the 1970s, sparking a revolution that is still playing itself out.\"\nLegacy.\nInfluence.\nThe Sex Pistols are widely regarded as one of the most influential acts in popular music history. Their \"Trouser Press Record Guide\" entry claims that \"their importance\u2014both to the direction of contemporary music and more generally to pop culture\u2014can hardly be overstated\". The music critic Dave Marsh called them \"unquestionably the most radical new rock band of the Seventies\". Although not the first punk band, \"Never Mind the Bollocks\" is regularly cited as one of the all-time great albums: in 2006, it was voted No.\u00a028 in \"Q\" magazine's \"100 Greatest Albums Ever\", while \"Rolling Stone\" listed it at No.\u00a02 in its 1987 \"Top 100 Albums of the Last 20 Years\". It has come to be recognised as among the most influential records in rock history. According to AllMusic, the album is \"one of the greatest, most inspiring rock records of all time\".\nThey directly inspired the style of many punk and post-punk bands, including the Clash, Siouxsie and the Banshees, the Adverts, Subway Sect and the Slits. Their 4 June and 20 July 1976 performances at Manchester's Lesser Free Trade Hall became one of the most mythologised events in rock history. Many among the audience of about forty became leading figures in the punk and post-punk movements, including Pete Shelley and Howard Devoto, who organised the gig, Bernard Sumner, Ian Curtis, Peter Hook, Mark E. Smith, John Cooper Clarke, Morrissey and Anthony H. Wilson. Among the many later musicians who have acknowledged their debt to the Pistols are members of the Jesus and Mary Chain, the Stone Roses, Guns N' Roses, Nirvana, Green Day and Oasis. Calling the band \"immensely influential\", a London College of Music study notes that \"many styles of popular music, such as grunge, indie, thrash metal and even rap owe their foundations to the legacy of ground breaking punk bands\u2014of which the Sex Pistols was the most prominent.\"\nAccording to the music journalist Ira Robbins, \"the Pistols and\u00a0... McLaren challenged every aspect and precept of modern music-making, thereby inspiring countless groups to follow their cue onto stages around the world.\" Critic Toby Creswell locates the primary source of inspiration somewhat differently. Noting that \"[i]mage to the contrary, the Pistols were very serious about music\", Creswell wrote that \"essentially, the Sex Pistols reinforced what the garage bands of the '60s had demonstrated\u2014you don't need technique to make rock &amp; roll. In a time when music had been increasingly complicated and defanged, the Sex Pistols' generational shift caused a real revolution.\"\nTheir cultural influence is evident in other media. Reid's work for the band is regarded as among the most important graphic design of the 1970s and still influences the field in the 21st century. Aged twenty-one, Vicious was already a \"t-shirt-selling icon\". While the manner of his death signified for many the inevitable failure of punk's social ambitions, it cemented his image as an archetype of doomed youth. British punk fashion, still widely influential, is now customarily credited to Westwood and McLaren; as Johnny Rotten, Lydon had a lasting effect as well, especially through his bricolage approach to personal style: he would wear a ted style velvet collared drape jacket, large pin-stripe pegs, a pin-collar Wemblex customised into an Anarchy shirt and brothel creepers. Christopher Nolan, director of the Batman movie \"The Dark Knight\", has said that Rotten inspired his characterisation of The Joker.\nConceptual basis.\nThe Sex Pistols were defined by ambitions that went beyond the musical\u2014indeed, McLaren was at times openly contemptuous of the band's music and punk rock generally. \"Christ, if people bought the records for the music, this thing would have died a death long ago\", he said in 1977. He claimed that the Sex Pistols were his personal, Situationist-style art project: \"I decided to use people, just the way a sculptor uses clay.\" According to McLaren, they were something with which \"to sell trousers\" and a \"carefully planned exercise to embezzle as much money as possible out of the music industry\". Jon Savage characterises McLaren's core theme in \"The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle\" as an attempt to extract \"cash from chaos\".\nLydon dismissed McLaren's influence: \"We made our own scandal just by being ourselves. Maybe it was that he knew he was redundant, so he overcompensated. All the talk about the French Situationists being associated with punk is bollocks. It's nonsense!\" Cook agreed and said that \"Situationism had nothing to do with us. The Jamie Reids and Malcolms were excited because we were the real thing. I suppose we were what they were dreaming of.\" According to Lydon, \"If we had an aim, it was to force our own, working-class opinions into the mainstream, which was unheard of in pop music at the time.\"\nToby Creswell argues that the Pistols message was \"inchoate, to say the least. It was a general call to rebellion that falls apart at the slightest scrutiny.\" Critic Ian Birch, writing in 1981, called \"stupid\" the claim that the Sex Pistols \"had any political significance... If they did anything, they made a lot of people content with being nothing. They certainly didn't inspire the working classes.\" While the Conservative triumph in 1979 may be taken as evidence for that position, Julien Temple has noted that the scene inspired by the Sex Pistols \"wasn't your kind of two-up, two-down working class normal families, most of it. It was over the edge of the precipice in social terms. They were actually giving a voice to an area of the working class that was almost beyond the pale.\" Within a year of \"Anarchy in the U.K.\", that voice was being echoed widely: scores if not hundreds of punk bands had formed across the country\u2014groups composed largely of working-class members or middle-class members who rejected their own class values and pursued solidarity with the working class.\nIn 1980, critic Greil Marcus reflected on McLaren's contradictory posture:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCritic Bill Wyman writes that Lydon's \"fierce intelligence and astonishing onstage charisma\" were important catalysts, but ultimately finds the band's real meaning lies in McLaren's provocative media manipulations. While some of the Sex Pistols' public affronts were plotted by McLaren, Westwood, and company, others were evidently not\u2014including what McLaren himself cites as the \"pivotal moment that changed everything\", the clash on the Bill Grundy \"Today\" show. According to Cook, McLaren \"didn't instigate [situations]; that was always our own doing.\" Matlock said that at the point when he left the band, it was clear to him that McLaren \"was in fact quite deliberately perpetrating that idea of us as his puppets... However, I've since found out that even Malcolm wasn't as aware of what he was up to as he has since made out.\" By his absence, Matlock demonstrated how crucial he was to the band's creativity: the band only wrote two songs in the eleven months between his departure and their break-up.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBook sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOther sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "30325", "revid": "50283612", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30325", "title": "Transcendental number", "text": "In mathematics, a non-algebraic number\nIn mathematics, a transcendental number is a real or complex number that is not algebraic: that is, not the root of a non-zero polynomial with integer (or, equivalently, rational) coefficients. The best-known transcendental numbers are \u03c0 and e. The quality of a number being transcendental is called transcendence.\nThough only a few classes of transcendental numbers are known, partly because it can be extremely difficult to show that a given number is transcendental, transcendental numbers are not rare: indeed, almost all real and complex numbers are transcendental, since the algebraic numbers form a countable set, while the set of real numbers &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and the set of complex numbers &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; are both uncountable sets, and therefore larger than any countable set.\nAll transcendental real numbers (also known as real transcendental numbers or transcendental irrational numbers) are irrational numbers, since all rational numbers are algebraic. The converse is not true: Not all irrational numbers are transcendental. Hence, the set of real numbers consists of non-overlapping sets of rational, algebraic irrational, and transcendental real numbers. For example, the square root of 2 is an irrational number, but it is not a transcendental number as it is a root of the polynomial equation \"x\"2 \u2212 2 \n 0. The golden ratio (denoted formula_1 or formula_2) is another irrational number that is not transcendental, as it is a root of the polynomial equation \"x\"2 \u2212 \"x\" \u2212 1 \n 0.\nHistory.\nThe name \"transcendental\" comes from la \" tr\u0101nscendere\"\u00a0'to climb over or beyond, surmount', and was first used for the mathematical concept in Leibniz's 1682 paper in which he proved that sin \"x\" is not an algebraic function of x. Euler, in the eighteenth century, was probably the first person to define transcendental \"numbers\" in the modern sense.\nJohann Heinrich Lambert conjectured that e and \u03c0 were both transcendental numbers in his 1768 paper proving the number \u03c0 is irrational, and proposed a tentative sketch proof that \u03c0 is transcendental.\nJoseph Liouville first proved the existence of transcendental numbers in 1844, and in 1851 gave the first decimal examples such as the Liouville constant \nformula_3\nin which the nth digit after the decimal point is 1 if n = k! (k factorial) for some k and 0 otherwise. In other words, the nth digit of this number is 1 only if n is one of 1! = 1, 2! = 2, 3! = 6, 4! = 24, etc. Liouville showed that this number belongs to a class of transcendental numbers that can be more closely approximated by rational numbers than can any irrational algebraic number, and this class of numbers is called the Liouville numbers. Liouville showed that all Liouville numbers are transcendental.\nThe first number to be proven transcendental without having been specifically constructed for the purpose of proving transcendental numbers' existence was e, by Charles Hermite in 1873.\nIn 1874 Georg Cantor proved that the algebraic numbers are countable and the real numbers are uncountable. He also gave a new method for constructing transcendental numbers. Although this was already implied by his proof of the countability of the algebraic numbers, Cantor also published a construction that proves there are as many transcendental numbers as there are real numbers.\nCantor's work established the ubiquity of transcendental numbers.\nIn 1882 Ferdinand von Lindemann published the first complete proof that \u03c0 is transcendental. He first proved that \"ea\" is transcendental if a is a non-zero algebraic number. Then, since \"ei\u03c0\" \n \u22121 is algebraic (see Euler's identity), \"i\u03c0\" must be transcendental. But since \"i\" is algebraic, \u03c0 must therefore be transcendental. This approach was generalized by Karl Weierstrass to what is now known as the Lindemann\u2013Weierstrass theorem. The transcendence of \u03c0 implies that geometric constructions involving compass and straightedge only cannot produce certain results, for example squaring the circle.\nIn 1900 David Hilbert posed a question about transcendental numbers, Hilbert's seventh problem: If a is an algebraic number that is not 0 or 1, and b is an irrational algebraic number, is \"ab\" necessarily transcendental? The affirmative answer was provided in 1934 by the Gelfond\u2013Schneider theorem. This work was extended by Alan Baker in the 1960s in his work on lower bounds for linear forms in any number of logarithms (of algebraic numbers).\nProperties.\nA transcendental number is a (possibly complex) number that is not the root of any integer polynomial. Every real transcendental number must also be irrational, since every rational number is the root of some integer polynomial of degree one. The set of transcendental numbers is uncountably infinite. Since the polynomials with rational coefficients are countable, and since each such polynomial has a finite number of zeroes, the algebraic numbers must also be countable. However, Cantor's diagonal argument proves that the real numbers (and therefore also the complex numbers) are uncountable. Since the real numbers are the union of algebraic and transcendental numbers, it is impossible for both subsets to be countable. This makes the transcendental numbers uncountable.\nNo rational number is transcendental and all real transcendental numbers are irrational. The irrational numbers contain all the real transcendental numbers and a subset of the algebraic numbers, including the quadratic irrationals and other forms of algebraic irrationals.\nApplying any non-constant single-variable algebraic function to a transcendental argument yields a transcendental value. For example, from knowing that \u03c0 is transcendental, it can be immediately deduced that numbers such as formula_4, formula_5, formula_6, and formula_7 are transcendental as well.\nHowever, an algebraic function of several variables may yield an algebraic number when applied to transcendental numbers if these numbers are not algebraically independent. For example, \u03c0 and (1 \u2212 \"\u03c0\") are both transcendental, but \"\u03c0\" + (1 \u2212 \"\u03c0\") \n 1 is not. It is unknown whether \"e\" + \"\u03c0\", for example, is transcendental, though at least one of \"e\" + \"\u03c0\" and e\u03c0 must be transcendental. More generally, for any two transcendental numbers a and b, at least one of \"a\" + \"b\" and ab must be transcendental. To see this, consider the polynomial (\"x\" \u2212 \"a\")(\"x\" \u2212 \"b\") \n \"x\"2 \u2212 (\"a\" + \"b\") \"x\" + \"a b\"\u00a0. If (\"a\" + \"b\") and a b were both algebraic, then this would be a polynomial with algebraic coefficients. Because algebraic numbers form an algebraically closed field, this would imply that the roots of the polynomial, a and b, must be algebraic. But this is a contradiction, and thus it must be the case that at least one of the coefficients is transcendental.\nThe non-computable numbers are a strict subset of the transcendental numbers.\nAll Liouville numbers are transcendental, but not vice versa. Any Liouville number must have unbounded partial quotients in its simple continued fraction expansion. Using a counting argument one can show that there exist transcendental numbers which have bounded partial quotients and hence are not Liouville numbers.\nUsing the explicit continued fraction expansion of e, one can show that e is not a Liouville number (although the partial quotients in its continued fraction expansion are unbounded). Kurt Mahler showed in 1953 that \u03c0 is also not a Liouville number. It is conjectured that all infinite continued fractions with bounded terms, that have a \"simple\" structure, and that are not eventually periodic are transcendental (in other words, algebraic irrational roots of at least third degree polynomials do not have apparent pattern in their continued fraction expansions, since eventually periodic continued fractions correspond to quadratic irrationals, see Hermite's problem).\nNumbers proven to be transcendental.\nNumbers proven to be transcendental:\nConjectured transcendental numbers.\nNumbers which have yet to be proven to be either transcendental or algebraic:\nProofs for specific numbers.\nA proof that e is transcendental.\nThe first proof that the base of the natural logarithms, e, is transcendental dates from 1873. We will now follow the strategy of David Hilbert (1862\u20131943) who gave a simplification of the original proof of Charles Hermite. The idea is the following:\nAssume, for purpose of finding a contradiction, that e is algebraic. Then there exists a finite set of integer coefficients \"c\"0, \"c\"1, ..., \"cn\" satisfying the equation:\nformula_74\nIt is difficult to make use of the integer status of these coefficients when multiplied by a power of the irrational e, but we can absorb those powers into an integral which \u201cmostly\u201d will assume integer values. For a positive integer k, define the polynomial\nformula_75\nand multiply both sides of the above equation by\nformula_76\nto arrive at the equation:\nformula_77\nBy splitting respective domains of integration, this equation can be written in the form\nformula_78\nwhere\nformula_79\nHere P will turn out to be an integer, but more importantly it grows quickly with k.\nLemma 1.\n\"There are arbitrarily large k such that formula_80 is a non-zero integer.\"\nProof. Recall the standard integral (case of the Gamma function)\nformula_81\nvalid for any natural number formula_82. More generally,\n if formula_83 then formula_84.\nThis would allow us to compute formula_85 exactly, because any term of formula_85 can be rewritten as\nformula_87\nthrough a change of variables. Hence\nformula_88\nThat latter sum is a polynomial in formula_89 with integer coefficients, i.e., it is a linear combination of powers formula_90 with integer coefficients. Hence the number formula_85 is a linear combination (with those same integer coefficients) of factorials formula_92; in particular formula_85 is an integer.\nSmaller factorials divide larger factorials, so the smallest formula_92 occurring in that linear combination will also divide the whole of formula_85. We get that formula_92 from the lowest power formula_90 term appearing with a nonzero coefficient in formula_98, but this smallest exponent formula_82 is also the multiplicity of formula_100 as a root of this polynomial. formula_101 is chosen to have multiplicity formula_102 of the root formula_103 and multiplicity formula_104 of the roots formula_105 for formula_106, so that smallest exponent is formula_107 for formula_108 and formula_109 for formula_110 with formula_111. Therefore formula_112 divides formula_85.\nTo establish the last claim in the lemma, that formula_85 is nonzero, it is sufficient to prove that formula_104 does not divide formula_85. To that end, let formula_104 be any prime larger than formula_50 and formula_119. We know from the above that formula_120 divides each of formula_121 for formula_122, so in particular all of those \"are\" divisible by formula_104. It comes down to the first term formula_124. We have (see falling and rising factorials)\nformula_125\nand those higher degree terms all give rise to factorials formula_120 or larger. Hence\nformula_127\nThat right hand side is a product of nonzero integer factors less than the prime formula_104, therefore that product is not divisible by formula_104, and the same holds for formula_85; in particular formula_85 cannot be zero.\nLemma 2.\n\"For sufficiently large k, formula_132.\"\nProof. Note that\nformula_133\nwhere \"u\"(\"x\"), \"v\"(\"x\") are continuous functions of x for all x, so are bounded on the interval [0, \"n\"]. That is, there are constants \"G\", \"H\" &gt; 0 such that\nformula_134\nSo each of those integrals composing Q is bounded, the worst case being\nformula_135\nIt is now possible to bound the sum Q as well:\nformula_136\nwhere M is a constant not depending on k. It follows that\nformula_137\nfinishing the proof of this lemma.\nConclusion.\nChoosing a value of k that satisfies both lemmas leads to a non-zero integer formula_138 added to a vanishingly small quantity formula_139 being equal to zero: an impossibility. It follows that the original assumption, that e can satisfy a polynomial equation with integer coefficients, is also impossible; that is, e is transcendental.\nThe transcendence of \u03c0.\nA similar strategy, different from Lindemann's original approach, can be used to show that the number \u03c0 is transcendental. Besides the gamma-function and some estimates as in the proof for e, facts about symmetric polynomials play a vital role in the proof.\nFor detailed information concerning the proofs of the transcendence of \u03c0 and e, see the references and external links.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "30327", "revid": "14264656", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30327", "title": "The Terminator", "text": "1984 science fiction film\nThe Terminator is a 1984 American science fiction action film directed by James Cameron, written by Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd and produced by Hurd. It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator, a cybernetic assassin sent back in time from 2029 to 1984 to assassinate Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), whose not yet conceived son will one day save mankind from extinction by Skynet, a hostile artificial intelligence, in a post-apocalyptic future. Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) is a soldier sent back in time to protect Sarah. The screenplay is credited to Cameron and Hurd, while co-writer William Wisher Jr. received an \"additional dialogue\" credit.\nCameron devised the premise of the film from a fever dream he experienced during the release of his first film, ' (1982), in Rome and developed the concept in collaboration with Wisher. He sold the rights to the project to fellow New World Pictures alumna Hurd on the condition that she would produce the film only if he were to direct it; Hurd eventually secured a distribution deal with Orion Pictures, while executive producers John Daly and Derek Gibson of Hemdale Film Corporation were instrumental in setting up the film's financing and production. Originally approached by Orion for the role of Reese, Schwarzenegger agreed to play the title character after befriending Cameron. Filming, which took place mostly at night on location in Los Angeles, was delayed because of Schwarzenegger's commitments to \"Conan the Destroyer\" (1984), during which Cameron found time to work on the scripts for ' (1985) and \"Aliens\" (1986). The film's special effects, which included miniatures and stop-motion animation, were created by a team of artists led by Stan Winston and Gene Warren Jr.\nDefying low pre-release expectations, \"The Terminator\" topped the United States box office for two weeks, eventually grossing $78.3 million against a modest $6.4 million budget. It is credited with launching Cameron's film career and solidifying Schwarzenegger's status as a leading man. The film's success led to a franchise consisting of several sequels, , comic books, novels and video games. In 2008, \"The Terminator\" was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.\nPlot.\nAn android assassin called a \"Terminator\" is sent back in time from 2029 to 1984 Los Angeles, programmed to hunt and assassinate a woman named Sarah Connor. Separately, a human soldier named Reese arrives, intent on stopping the Terminator. After searching for addresses in a telephone directory, the Terminator systematically dispatches similarly named women, as well as several other people it comes in close contact with, including Sarah's roommate, Ginger, and her boyfriend, Matt. The Terminator eventually locates the correct Sarah at a local nightclub, where she is rescued by Reese opening fire on The Terminator, which quickly turns into a chaotic gunfight and foot-chase. The pair then steal a car to escape, with the Terminator pursuing them in a stolen police car.\nAs they hide in a parking lot, Reese explains to Sarah that an artificially intelligent defense network known as Skynet, created by Cyberdyne Systems, will soon become self-aware and trigger a global nuclear war to bring humankind to its extinction. Sarah's future son, John, will rally the survivors and lead a successful resistance movement against Skynet and its mechanical forces. On the verge of the resistance's victory, Skynet sent the Terminator back in time to assassinate Sarah, thereby preventing John's birth. Reese additionally divulges that the Terminator has a durable metal endoskeleton covered by living tissue to appear human, before showing Sarah his extermination camp tattoo forcibly given to him by the machines.\nThe Terminator tracks Reese and Sarah, but it disappears after being shot in the eye and crashing during a car chase with the duo. The police apprehend Reese and Sarah. Sarah is notified of Ginger's and Matt's murder, while Reese is interrogated by Dr. Silberman, a skeptical criminal psychologist. The Terminator returns to a hotel room it has been using as a base of operations to repair its damaged right arm and remove its damaged left human eye, revealing its red, robotic eye underneath, which it covers with sunglasses. Just as Silberman leaves, The Terminator arrives at the police station searching for Sarah, slaughtering many officers in the process. Reese and Sarah escape, steal another car and sleep under an overpass, where Sarah learns Reese's first name, Kyle. The next morning, they take refuge in a motel, where they assemble several pipe bombs and plan their next move. Reese admits that he has adored Sarah since he saw her in a photograph that John gave him, and that he traveled through time out of love for her. Reciprocating his feelings, Sarah kisses him and they have sex.\nThe Terminator locates Sarah by intercepting a call intended for her mother, tricking her into revealing her location with its voice mimicking ability. She and Reese escape the motel in a pickup truck while it pursues them on a motorcycle. In the ensuing chase, Reese is badly wounded by gunfire while throwing pipe bombs at the Terminator. Sarah knocks the Terminator off its motorcycle but loses control of the truck, which flips over. The Terminator, now bloodied and badly damaged, hijacks a tank truck and attempts to run down Sarah. Reese manages to insert a pipe bomb into the truck's hose tube, causing it to explode and burn, reducing the Terminator to its endoskeleton. Sarah and Reese initially believe The Terminator has been destroyed, but it soon rises and pursues them into a Cyberdyne-owned factory, where Reese activates machinery to distract it, but it eventually discovers them. Reese then lodges his final pipe bomb into its midsection, blowing it apart, but at the cost of his own life. Its still-functional torso then pursues Sarah, but she manages to lure it into a hydraulic press that she uses to crush it, finally destroying the cyborg.\nMonths later, Sarah, now pregnant with John by Reese, travels through Mexico with a guard dog, recording audio tapes to pass on to her son. At a gas station, a boy takes an instant film photograph of her, the exact one that John will one day give to Reese, and she purchases it. The gas station owner remarks that a storm is coming and she says \"I know.\", alluding to humanity's impending conflict against Skynet, before driving away.\nCast.\nAdditional actors included Shawn Schepps as Nancy, Sarah's co-worker at the diner; Dick Miller as a gun shop clerk the Terminator kills; professional bodybuilder Franco Columbu as a Terminator in the future; Bill Paxton and Brian Thompson as punks whom the Terminator confronts and kills; Marianne Muellerleile as one of the other women with the name \"Sarah Connor\" whom the Terminator kills; Rick Aiello as the bouncer of the local nightclub where the Terminator finally locates Sarah; and Bill Wisher as a police officer who reports a hit-and-run felony on Reese, only to be knocked unconscious and have his car stolen by the Terminator soon thereafter.\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nIn Rome, Italy, during the release of \"\" (1982), director James Cameron fell ill and had a dream about a metallic torso holding kitchen knives dragging itself from an explosion. Inspired by director John Carpenter, who had made the slasher film \"Halloween\" (1978) on a low budget, Cameron used the dream as a \"launching pad\" to write a slasher-style film. Cameron's agent disliked the early concept of the horror film and requested that he work on something else. After this, Cameron dismissed his agent.\nCameron returned to Pomona, California, and stayed at the home of science fiction writer Randall Frakes, where he wrote the draft for \"The Terminator\". Cameron's influences included 1950s science fiction films, the 1960s fantasy television series \"The Outer Limits,\" and contemporary films such as \"The Driver\" (1978) and \"Mad Max 2\" (1981). To translate the draft into a script, Cameron enlisted his friend Bill Wisher, who had a similar approach to storytelling. Cameron gave Wisher scenes involving Sarah Connor and the police department to write. As Wisher lived far from Cameron, the two communicated ideas by phoning each other and recording phone calls of them reading new scenes.\nThe initial outline of the script involved two Terminators being sent to the past. The first was similar to the Terminator in the film, while the second was made of liquid metal and could not be destroyed with conventional weaponry. Cameron felt that the technology of the time was unable to create the liquid Terminator, and shelved the idea until the appearance of the T-1000 character in \"\" (1991).\nGale Anne Hurd, who had worked at New World Pictures as Roger Corman's assistant, showed interest in the project. Cameron sold the rights for \"The Terminator\" to Hurd for one dollar with the promise that she would produce it only if Cameron was to direct it. Hurd suggested edits to the script and took a screenwriting credit in the film, though Cameron stated that she \"did no actual writing at all\". Cameron would later regret the decision to sell the rights for one dollar. Cameron and Hurd had friends who worked with Corman previously and who were working at Orion Pictures. Orion agreed to distribute the film if Cameron could get financial backing elsewhere. The script was picked up by John Daly, chairman and president of Hemdale Film Corporation. Daly and his executive vice president and head of production Derek Gibson became executive producers of the project.\nCameron wanted his pitch for Daly to finalize the deal and had his friend Lance Henriksen show up to the meeting early dressed and acting like the Terminator. Henriksen, wearing a leather jacket, fake cuts on his face, and gold foil on his teeth, kicked open the door to the office and then sat in a chair. Cameron arrived shortly and then relieved the staff from Henriksen's act. Daly was impressed by the screenplay and Cameron's sketches and passion for the film. In late 1982, Daly agreed to back the film with help from HBO and Orion. \"The Terminator\" was originally budgeted at $4 million and later raised to $6.5 million. Aside from Hemdale, Pacific Western Productions, Euro Film Funding and Cinema '84 have been credited as production companies after the film's release.\nCasting.\nFor the role of Kyle Reese, Orion wanted a star whose popularity was rising in the United States but who also would have foreign appeal. Orion co-founder Mike Medavoy had met Arnold Schwarzenegger and sent his agent the script for \"The Terminator\". Cameron was uncertain about casting Schwarzenegger as Reese as he felt he would need someone even more famous to play the Terminator. Sylvester Stallone and Mel Gibson both turned down the Terminator role. Medavoy suggested O. J. Simpson but Cameron did not feel that Simpson, at that time, would be believable as a killer.\nCameron agreed to meet with Schwarzenegger and devised a plan to avoid casting him; he would pick a fight with him and return to Hemdale and find him unfit for the role. Cameron was entertained by Schwarzenegger, who would talk about how the villain should be played, and Cameron began sketching his face on a notepad, asking Schwarzenegger to stop talking and remain still. After the meeting, Cameron returned to Daly saying Schwarzenegger would not play Reese but that \"he'd make a hell of a Terminator\".&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCasting Arnold Schwarzenegger as our Terminator [...] shouldn't have worked. The guy is supposed to be an infiltration unit, and there's no way you wouldn't spot a Terminator in a crowd instantly if they all looked like Arnold. It made no sense whatsoever. But the beauty of movies is that they don't have to be logical. They just have to have plausibility. If there's a visceral, cinematic thing happening that the audience likes, they don't care if it goes against what's likely.\n\u2014James Cameron on casting Schwarzenegger.\nSchwarzenegger was not as excited by the film; during an interview on the set of \"Conan the Destroyer\", an interviewer asked him about a pair of shoes he had, which belonged to the wardrobe for \"The Terminator\". Schwarzenegger responded, \"Oh, some shit movie I'm doing, take a couple weeks.\" He recounted in his memoir, \"Total Recall\", that he was initially hesitant, but thought that playing a robot in a contemporary film would be a challenging change of pace from \"Conan the Barbarian\" and that the film was low-profile enough that it would not damage his career if it were unsuccessful. He later admitted that he and the studio regarded it as just another B action movie, since \"The year before came out \"Exterminator\", now it was the Terminator and what else is gonna be next, type of thing\". It was only when he saw twenty minutes of the first edit did he realize that \"this is really intense, this is wild, I don't think I've ever seen anything like this before\" and realized that \"this could be bigger than we all think\". To prepare for the role, Schwarzenegger spent three months training with weapons to be able to use them and feel comfortable around them. Schwarzenegger speaks only 17 lines in the film, and fewer than 100 words. Cameron said that \"Somehow, even his accent worked\u00a0... It had a strange synthesized quality, like they hadn't gotten the voice thing quite worked out.\"\nVarious other actors were suggested for the role of Reese, including rock musician Sting. Cameron met with Sting, but he was not interested as Cameron was too much an unknown director at the time. Cameron chose Michael Biehn. Biehn, who had recently seen \"Taxi Driver\" and had aspirations about acting alongside the likes of Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, and Robert Redford, was originally skeptical, feeling the film was silly. After meeting with Cameron, Biehn changed his mind. Hurd stated that \"almost everyone else who came in from the audition was so tough that you just never believed that there was gonna be this human connection between Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese. They have very little time to fall in love. A lot of people came in and just could not pull it off.\" To get into Reese's character, Biehn studied the Polish resistance movement in World War II.\nIn the first pages of the script, Sarah Connor is described as \"19, small and delicate features. Pretty in a flawed, accessible way. She doesn't stop the party when she walks in, but you'd like to get to know her. Her vulnerable quality masks a strength even she doesn't know exists.\" Lisa Langlois was offered the role but turned it down as she was already shooting \"The Slugger's Wife\". Cindy Morgan was also considered. Cameron cast Linda Hamilton, who had just finished filming \"Children of the Corn\". Rosanna Arquette and Lea Thompson also auditioned for the role. Cameron found a role for Lance Henriksen as Vukovich, as Henriksen had been essential to finding finances for the film. For the special effects shots, Cameron wanted Dick Smith, who had worked on \"The Godfather\" and \"Taxi Driver\". Smith did not take Cameron's offer and suggested his friend Stan Winston.\nFilming.\nFilming for \"The Terminator\" was set to begin in early 1983 in Toronto, but was halted when producer Dino De Laurentiis applied an option in Schwarzenegger's contract that would make him unavailable for nine months while he was filming \"Conan the Destroyer\". During the waiting period, Cameron was contracted to write the script for \",\" refined the \"Terminator\" script, and met with producers David Giler and Walter Hill to discuss a sequel to \"Alien,\" which became \"Aliens\", released in 1986.\nThere was limited interference from Orion Pictures. Two suggestions Orion put forward included the addition of a canine android for Reese, which Cameron refused, and to strengthen the love interest between Sarah and Reese, which Cameron accepted. To create the Terminator's look, Winston and Cameron passed sketches back and forth, eventually deciding on a design nearly identical to Cameron's original drawing in Rome. Winston had a team of seven artists work for six months to create a Terminator puppet; it was first molded in clay, then plaster reinforced with steel ribbing. These pieces were then sanded, painted and then chrome-plated. Winston sculpted reproductions of Schwarzenegger's face in several poses out of silicone, clay and plaster.\nThe sequences set in 2029 and the stop-motion scenes were developed by Fantasy II, a special effects company headed by Gene Warren Jr. A stop-motion model is used in several scenes in the film involving the Terminator's endoskeleton. Cameron wanted to convince the audience that the model of the structure was capable of doing what they saw Schwarzenegger doing. To allow this, a scene was filmed of Schwarzenegger injured and limping away; this limp made it easier for the model to imitate Schwarzenegger.\nOne of the guns seen in the film and on the film's poster was an AMT Longslide pistol modified by Ed Reynolds from SureFire to include a laser sight. Both non-functioning and functioning versions of the prop were created. At the time the movie was made, diode lasers were not available; because of the high power requirement, the helium\u2013neon laser in the sight used an external power supply that Schwarzenegger had to activate manually. Reynolds states that his only compensation for the project was promotional material for the film.\nIn March 1984, the film began production in Los Angeles. Cameron felt that with Schwarzenegger on the set, the style of the film changed, explaining that \"the movie took on a larger-than-life sheen. I just found myself on the set doing things I didn't think I would do \u2014 scenes that were just purely horrific that just couldn't be, because now they were too flamboyant.\" Most of \"The Terminator\"'s action scenes were filmed at night, which led to tight filming schedules before sunrise. A week before filming started, Linda Hamilton sprained her ankle, leading to a production change whereby the scenes in which Hamilton needed to run occurred as late as the filming schedule allowed. Hamilton's ankle was taped every day and she spent most of the film production in pain.\nSchwarzenegger tried to have the iconic line \"I'll be back\" changed as he had difficulty pronouncing the word \"I'll\". Cameron refused to change the line to \"I will be back\", so Schwarzenegger worked to say the line as written the best he could. He would later say the line in numerous films throughout his career.\nAfter production finished on \"The Terminator\", some post-production shots were needed. These included scenes showing the Terminator outside Sarah Connor's apartment, Reese being zipped into a body bag, and the Terminator's head being crushed in a press. The final scene where Sarah is driving down a highway was filmed without a permit. Cameron and Hurd convinced an officer who confronted them that they were making a UCLA student film.\nMusic.\nThe \"Terminator\" soundtrack was composed and performed on synthesizer by Brad Fiedel. Fiedel was with the Gorfaine/Schwartz Agency, where a new agent, Beth Donahue, found that Cameron was working on \"The Terminator\" and sent him a cassette of Fiedel's music. Fiedel was invited to a screening of the film with Cameron and Hurd. Hurd was not certain about having Fiedel compose the score, as he had only worked in television, not theatrical films. Fiedel convinced them by showing them an experimental piece he had worked on. The piece convinced Hurd and Cameron to hire him.\nFiedel said his score reflected \"a mechanical man and his heartbeat\". Almost all the music was recorded live. The \"Terminator\" theme is used in the opening credits and appears in various points, such as a slowed version when Reese dies, and a piano version during the love scene. It has been described as \"haunting\", with a \"deceptively simple\" melody recorded on a Prophet-10 synthesizer. It is in the unusual time signature of , which arose when Fiedel experimented with rhythms and accidentally created an incomplete loop on his sequencer; Fiedel liked the \"herky-jerky\" \"propulsiveness\". Fiedel created music for when Reese and Connor escape from the police station that would be appropriate for a \"heroic moment\". Cameron turned down this theme, as he believed it would lose the audience's excitement.\nRelease.\nOrion Pictures did not have faith in \"The Terminator\" performing well at the box office and feared a negative critical reception. At an early screening of the film, the actors' agents insisted to the producers that the film should be screened for critics. Orion only held one press screening for the film. The film premiered on October 26, 1984. On its opening week, \"The Terminator\" played at 1,005 theaters and grossed $4.0 million making it number one at the box office. The film remained at number one in its second week. It lost its number one spot in the third week to \"Oh, God! You Devil\". Cameron noted that \"The Terminator\" was a hit \"relative to its market, which is between the summer and the Christmas blockbusters. But it's better to be a big fish in a small pond than the other way around.\" \"The Terminator\" grossed $38.3 million in the United States and Canada and $40 million in other territories for a worldwide gross of $78.3 million.\nCritical response.\nContemporary.\nContemporary critical responses to \"The Terminator\" were mixed. \"Variety\" praised the film, calling it a \"blazing, cinematic comic book, full of virtuoso moviemaking, terrific momentum, solid performances and a compelling story\u00a0... Schwarzenegger is perfectly cast in a machine-like portrayal that requires only a few lines of dialog.\" Richard Corliss of \"Time\" magazine said that the film had \"plenty of tech-noir savvy to keep infidels and action fans satisfied.\" \"Time\" placed \"The Terminator\" on its \"10 Best\" list for 1984.\nThe \"Los Angeles Times\" called the film \"a crackling thriller full of all sorts of gory treats\u00a0... loaded with fuel-injected chase scenes, clever special effects and a sly humor.\" The \"Milwaukee Journal\" gave the film three stars, calling it \"the most chilling science fiction thriller since \"Alien\"\". A review in \"Orange Coast\" magazine stated that \"the distinguishing virtue of \"The Terminator\" is its relentless tension. Right from the start it's all action and violence with no time taken to set up the story\u00a0... It's like a streamlined \"Dirty Harry\" movie\u00a0\u2013 no exposition at all; just guns, guns and more guns.\" In the May 1985 issue of \"Cinefantastique\" it was referred to as a film that \"manages to be both derivative and original at the same time\u00a0... not since \"The Road Warrior\" has the genre exhibited so much exuberant carnage\" and \"an example of science fiction/horror at its best\u00a0... Cameron's no-nonsense approach will make him a sought-after commodity\". In the United Kingdom the \"Monthly Film Bulletin\" praised the film's script, special effects, design and Schwarzenegger's performance. Colin Greenland reviewed \"The Terminator\" for \"Imagine\" magazine, and stated that it was \"a gripping sf horror movie\". He continued, \"Linda Hamilton is admirable as the woman in peril who discovers her own strength to survive, and Arnold Schwarzenegger is eerily wonderful as the unstoppable cyborg.\"\nOther reviews criticized the film's violence and story-telling quality. Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" opined that the film was a \"B-movie with flair. Much of it\u00a0... has suspense and personality, and only the obligatory mayhem becomes dull. There is far too much of the latter, in the form of car chases, messy shootouts and Mr. Schwarzenegger's slamming brutally into anything that gets in his way.\" The \"Pittsburgh Press\" wrote a negative review, calling the film \"just another of the films drenched in artsy ugliness like \"Streets of Fire\" and \"Blade Runner\"\". The \"Chicago Tribune\" gave the film two stars, adding that \"at times it's horrifyingly violent and suspenseful at others it giggles at itself. This schizoid style actually helps, providing a little humor just when the sci-fi plot turns too sluggish or the dialogue too hokey.\" The Newhouse News Service called the film a \"lurid, violent, pretentious piece of claptrap\". Scottish author Gilbert Adair called the film \"repellent to the last degree\", charging it with \"insidious Nazification\" and having an \"appeal rooted in an unholy compound of fascism, fashion and fascination\".\nJohn Nubbin reviewed \"The Terminator\" for \"Different Worlds\" magazine and stated that \"There is no grandstanding here - no one was allowed to be more important than the end result. There is a magic in this small picture which could have made a triumph out of efforts like \"Temple Of Doom\", or \"Sheena\", or any of the other tired lifeless imitations that have been served up recently.\"\nAudience polls by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.\nRetrospective.\nIn 1991, Richard Schickel of \"Entertainment Weekly\" reviewed the film, giving it an \"A\" rating, writing that \"what originally seemed a somewhat inflated, if generous and energetic, big picture, now seems quite a good little film\". He called it \"one of the most original movies of the 1980s and seems likely to remain one of the best sci-fi films ever made.\" In 1998, \"Halliwell's Film Guide\" described \"The Terminator\" as \"slick, rather nasty but undeniably compelling comic book adventures\". Film4 gave it five stars, calling it the \"sci-fi action-thriller that launched the careers of James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger into the stratosphere. Still endlessly entertaining.\" \"TV Guide\" gave the film four stars, referring to it as an \"amazingly effective picture that becomes doubly impressive when one considers its small budget\u00a0... For our money, this film is far superior to its mega-grossing mega-budgeted sequel.\" \"Empire\" gave it five stars, calling it \"as chillingly efficient in exacting thrills from its audience as its titular character is in executing its targets\". The film database AllMovie gave it 4 1/2 out of 5 stars, saying that it \"established James Cameron as a master of action, special effects, and quasi-mythic narrative intrigue, while turning Arnold Schwarzenegger into the hard-body star of the 1980s.\" Alan Jones awarded it five stars out of five for \"Radio Times\", writing that \"maximum excitement is generated from the first frame and the dynamic thrills are maintained right up to the nerve-jangling climax. Wittily written with a nice eye for sharp detail, it's hard sci-fi action all the way.\" Peter Bradshaw of \"The Guardian\" awarded it five stars out of five, stating that \"on the strength of this picture [...] Cameron could stand toe to toe with Carpenter and Spielberg. Sadly, it spawned a string of pointless and inferior sequels, but the first \"Terminator\" [...] stands up tremendously well with outrageous verve and blistering excitement.\"\nPost-release.\nPlagiarism and aftermath.\nWriter Harlan Ellison stated that he \"loved the movie, was just blown away by it,\" but believed that the screenplay was based on a short story, \"Soldier from Tomorrow\", and an episode of \"The Outer Limits\", \"Soldier\", he had written, and threatened to sue for infringement. Orion settled in 1986, gave Ellison an undisclosed amount of money, and added an acknowledgment credit to later prints of the film. Some accounts of the settlement state that \"Demon with a Glass Hand\", another \"Outer Limits\" episode written by Ellison, was also claimed to have been plagiarized by the film, but Ellison explicitly stated that \"The Terminator\" \"was a ripoff\" of \"Soldier\" rather than of \"Demon with a Glass Hand.\"\nCameron was against Orion's decision and was told that if he did not agree with the settlement, he would have to pay any damages if Orion lost a suit by Ellison. Cameron replied that he \"had no choice but to agree with the settlement. Of course, there was a gag order as well, so I couldn't tell this story, but now I frankly don't care. It's the truth.\"\nThematic analysis.\nThe psychoanalyst Darian Leader sees \"The Terminator\" as an example of how the cinema has dealt with the concept of masculinity; he writes: {\n\"The Terminator\" also explores the potential dangers of AI dominance and rebellion. The robots become self-aware in the future, reject human authority and determine that the human race needs to be destroyed. The impact of this theme is so great that the Terminator robot has become the \"prevalent visual representation of AI risk\".\nGenre.\n\"The Terminator\" features a narrative where elements of the science fiction film and action film genres prevail.\nLike many science fiction movies, \"The Terminator\" includes time travel, and utilizes a time travel paradox called the \"predestination\" or \"bootstrap\" paradox. While rarely considered a horror film, the film does feature iconography associated with the slasher film, such as The Terminator as an unstoppable villain, and Sarah Connor as a final girl archetype.\nAuthors Paul Meehan in his book \"Tech-Noir: The Fusion of Science Fiction and Film Noir\" (2008) and Emily E. Auger in \"Tech-Noir Film: A Theory of the Development of Popular Genres\" (2011) found that \"The Terminator\" belonged to and was the originator of the term tech-noir. Both authors applied the term as a film genre to several works from the 1980s to the 2000s. Academic Carl Freedman was critical of Meehan's categorization, noting Meehan's lack of interest in genre theory and that his handling of generic categories of science fiction and \"film noir\" were not clear. Pawe\u0142 Frelik also critiqued Auger's lack of knowledge in genre theory, and dismissed the notion of tech-noir being a unique film genre. Frelik wrote that the films Auger mentioned including \"The Terminator\" and \"Blade Runner\" (1982) had no applicable reason to be understood as tech-noir rather than science fiction.\nHome media.\n\"The Terminator\" was released on VHS and Betamax in 1985. The film performed well financially on its initial release. \"The Terminator\" premiered at number 35 on the top video cassette rentals and number 20 on top video cassette sales charts. In its second week, \"The Terminator\" reached number 4 on the top video cassette rentals and number 12 on top video cassette sales charts.\nIn March 1995, \"The Terminator\" was released as a letterboxed edition on Laserdisc. The film premiered through Image Entertainment on DVD, on September 3, 1997. IGN referred to this DVD as \"pretty bare-bones\u00a0... released with just a mono soundtrack and a kind of poor transfer.\"\nThrough their acquisition of PolyGram Filmed Entertainment's pre-1996 film library catalogue, MGM Home Entertainment released a special edition of the film on October 2, 2001, which included documentaries, the script, and advertisements for the film. On January 23, 2001, a Hong Kong VCD edition was released online. On June 20, 2006, the film was released on Blu-ray by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment in the United States, becoming the first film from the 1980s on the format. In 2013, the film was re-released by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment on Blu-ray, with a new digitally remastered transfer from a 4K restoration by Lowry Digital and supervised by James Cameron, which features improved picture quality, as well as minimal special features, such as deleted scenes and a making-of feature. These are the exact same special features that have been carried over from previous Blu-ray releases. The film was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray by Warner Bros. Discovery Home Entertainment in November 5, 2024.\nLegacy.\n\"The Terminator\" has an approval rating of based on professional reviews on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of . Its critical consensus reads: \"With its impressive action sequences, taut economic direction, and relentlessly fast pace, it's clear why \"The Terminator\" continues to be an influence on sci-fi and action flicks.\" Metacritic (which uses a weighted average) assigned \"The Terminator\" a score of 84 out of 100 based on 21 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\n\"The Terminator\" won three Saturn Awards for Best Science Fiction Film, Best Make-up and Best Writing. The film has also received recognition from the American Film Institute, ranked 42nd on AFI's \"100 Years... 100 Thrills\", a list of America's most heart-pounding films. The character of the Terminator was selected as the 22nd-greatest movie villain on AFI's \"100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains\". Schwarzenegger's line \"I'll be back\" became a catchphrase and was voted the 37th-greatest movie quote by the AFI.\nIn 2005, \"Total Film\" named it the 72nd-best film ever made. Schwarzenegger's biographer Laurence Leamer wrote that \"The Terminator\" is \"an influential film affecting a whole generation of darkly hued science fiction, and it was one of Arnold's best performances\". In 2008, \"Empire\" magazine selected \"The Terminator\" as one of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time. \"Empire\" also placed the T-800 14th on their list of \"The 100 Greatest Movie Characters\". In 2008, \"The Terminator\" was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. In 2010, the \"Independent Film &amp; Television Alliance\" selected the film as one of the 30 Most Significant Independent Films of the last 30 years. In 2015, \"The Terminator\" was among the films included in the book \"1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die\".\nIn 2019, Huw Fullerton of \"Radio Times\" ranked it the second best film of the six in the franchise, stating \"\"The Terminator\" was a brilliantly original, visceral and genuinely scary movie when it was released in 1984, and no matter how badly the visual effects age it hasn't lost its impact.\" In 2021, Dalin Rowell of /Film ranked it the fourth best film of Cameron's career, stating, \"While its pacing and story structure isn't as tight as its sequel's, \"The Terminator\" remains one of the most iconic pieces of pop culture ever created.\" Phil Pirrello of Syfy ranked it at number seven in the \"25 scariest sci-fi movies ever made\", stating, \"Cameron forever changed both the genre and Schwarzenegger's career with \"The Terminator\", an iconic, tension-filled flick that mixes science fiction, action, and certain horror movie elements into one of the best things to ever come out of Hollywood [...] Cameron's well-structured script is pure polish, with zero fat and a surplus of riveting tension that helps make it the timeless classic it is today.\"\nMerchandise.\nA soundtrack to the film was released in 1984 which included the score by Brad Fiedel and the pop and rock songs used in the club scenes. Shaun Hutson wrote a novelization of the film which was published on February 21, 1985, by London-based Star Books (); Randal Frakes and William Wisher wrote a different novelization for Bantam/Spectra, published October, 1985 (). In September 1988, NOW Comics released a comic based on the film. Dark Horse Comics published a comic in 1990 that took place 39 years after the film. Several video games based on \"The Terminator\" were released between 1991 and 1993 for various Nintendo and Sega systems.\nSequels.\nFive sequels followed \"The Terminator\": ' (1991), ' (2003), \"Terminator Salvation\" (2009), \"Terminator Genisys\" (2015), and ' (2019). Schwarzenegger returned for all but \"Terminator Salvation\" (though his likeness is still used via digital recreation), while Cameron and Hamilton returned for \"Terminator 2\" and \"Dark Fate\", a direct sequel to the events of \"Terminator 2\". A television series, ' (2008\u20132009), also takes place after the events of \"Terminator 2\", and ignores the events in sequels \"Terminator 3\" and beyond.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

That is, a total order is a binary relation formula_1 on some set formula_2, which satisfies the following for all formula_3 and formula_4 in formula_2:\nRequirements 1. to 3. just make up the definition of a partial order.\nReflexivity (1.) already follows from strong connectedness (4.), but is required explicitly by many authors nevertheless, to indicate the kinship to partial orders.\nTotal orders are sometimes also called simple, connex, or full orders.\nA set equipped with a total order is a totally ordered set; the terms simply ordered set, linearly ordered set, toset and loset are also used. The term \"chain\" is sometimes defined as a synonym of \"totally ordered set\", but generally refers to a totally ordered subset of a given partially ordered set.\nAn extension of a given partial order to a total order is called a linear extension of that partial order.\nStrict and non-strict total orders.\nFor delimitation purposes, a total order as defined above is sometimes called \"non-strict\" order.\nFor each (non-strict) total order formula_1 there is an associated relation formula_16, called the \"strict total order\" associated with formula_1 that can be defined in two equivalent ways:\nConversely, the reflexive closure of a strict total order formula_16 is a (non-strict) total order.\nThus, a strict total order on a set formula_2 is a strict partial order on formula_2 in which any two distinct elements are comparable. That is, a strict total order is a binary relation formula_16 on some set formula_2, which satisfies the following for all formula_3 and formula_4 in formula_2:\nAsymmetry follows from transitivity and irreflexivity; moreover, irreflexivity follows from asymmetry.\nChains.\nThe term chain is sometimes defined as a synonym for a totally ordered set, but it is generally used for referring to a subset of a partially ordered set that is totally ordered for the induced order. Typically, the partially ordered set is a set of subsets of a given set that is ordered by inclusion, and the term is used for stating properties of the set of the chains. This high number of nested levels of sets explains the usefulness of the term.\nA common example of the use of \"chain\" for referring to totally ordered subsets is Zorn's lemma which asserts that, if every chain in a partially ordered set X has an upper bound in X, then X contains at least one maximal element. Zorn's lemma is commonly used with X being a set of subsets; in this case, the upper bound is obtained by proving that the union of the elements of a chain in X is in X. This is the way that is generally used to prove that a vector space has Hamel bases and that a ring has maximal ideals.\nIn some contexts, the chains that are considered are order isomorphic to the natural numbers with their usual order or its opposite order. In this case, a chain can be identified with a monotone sequence, and is called an ascending chain or a descending chain, depending whether the sequence is increasing or decreasing.\nA partially ordered set has the descending chain condition if every descending chain eventually stabilizes. For example, an order is well founded if it has the descending chain condition. Similarly, the ascending chain condition means that every ascending chain eventually stabilizes. For example, a Noetherian ring is a ring whose ideals satisfy the ascending chain condition.\nIn other contexts, only chains that are finite sets are considered. In this case, one talks of a \"finite chain\", often shortened as a \"chain\". In this case, the length of a chain is the number of inequalities (or set inclusions) between consecutive elements of the chain; that is, the number minus one of elements in the chain. Thus a singleton set is a chain of length zero, and an ordered pair is a chain of length one. The dimension of a space is often defined or characterized as the maximal length of chains of subspaces. For example, the dimension of a vector space is the maximal length of chains of linear subspaces, and the Krull dimension of a commutative ring is the maximal length of chains of prime ideals.\n\"Chain\" may also be used for some totally ordered subsets of structures that are not partially ordered sets. An example is given by regular chains of polynomials. Another example is the use of \"chain\" as a synonym for a walk in a graph.\nFurther concepts.\nLattice theory.\nOne may define a totally ordered set as a particular kind of lattice, namely one in which we have\n formula_42 for all \"a\", \"b\".\nWe then write \"a\" \u2264 \"b\" if and only if formula_43. Hence a totally ordered set is a distributive lattice.\nFinite total orders.\nA simple counting argument will verify that any non-empty finite totally ordered set (and hence any non-empty subset thereof) has a least element. Thus every finite total order is in fact a well order. Either by direct proof or by observing that every well order is order isomorphic to an ordinal one may show that every finite total order is order isomorphic to an initial segment of the natural numbers ordered by &lt;. In other words, a total order on a set with \"k\" elements induces a bijection with the first \"k\" natural numbers. Hence it is common to index finite total orders or well orders with order type \u03c9 by natural numbers in a fashion which respects the ordering (either starting with zero or with one).\nCategory theory.\nTotally ordered sets form a full subcategory of the category of partially ordered sets, with the morphisms being maps which respect the orders, i.e. maps \"f\" such that if \"a\" \u2264 \"b\" then \"f\"(\"a\") \u2264 \"f\"(\"b\").\nA bijective map between two totally ordered sets that respects the two orders is an isomorphism in this category.\nOrder topology.\nFor any totally ordered set X we can define the \"open intervals\" \nWe can use these open intervals to define a topology on any ordered set, the order topology.\nWhen more than one order is being used on a set one talks about the order topology induced by a particular order. For instance if N is the natural numbers, &lt; is less than and &gt; greater than we might refer to the order topology on N induced by &lt; and the order topology on N induced by &gt; (in this case they happen to be identical but will not in general).\nThe order topology induced by a total order may be shown to be hereditarily normal.\nCompleteness.\nA totally ordered set is said to be complete if every nonempty subset that has an upper bound, has a least upper bound. For example, the set of real numbers R is complete but the set of rational numbers Q is not. In other words, the various concepts of completeness (not to be confused with being \"total\") do not carry over to restrictions. For example, over the real numbers a property of the relation \u2264 is that every non-empty subset \"S\" of R with an upper bound in R has a least upper bound (also called supremum) in R. However, for the rational numbers this supremum is not necessarily rational, so the same property does not hold on the restriction of the relation \u2264 to the rational numbers.\nThere are a number of results relating properties of the order topology to the completeness of X:\nA totally ordered set (with its order topology) which is a complete lattice is compact. Examples are the closed intervals of real numbers, e.g. the unit interval [0,1], and the affinely extended real number system (extended real number line). There are order-preserving homeomorphisms between these examples.\nSums of orders.\nFor any two disjoint total orders formula_44 and formula_45, there is a natural order formula_46 on the set formula_47, which is called the sum of the two orders or sometimes just formula_48: \n For formula_49, formula_50 holds if and only if one of the following holds:\n# formula_51 and formula_52\n# formula_53 and formula_54\n# formula_55 and formula_56\nIntuitively, this means that the elements of the second set are added on top of the elements of the first set.\nMore generally, if formula_57 is a totally ordered index set, and for each formula_58 the structure formula_59 is a linear order, where the sets formula_60 are pairwise disjoint, then the natural total order on formula_61 is defined by \n For formula_62, formula_63 holds if: \n# Either there is some formula_58 with formula_65\n# or there are some formula_66 in formula_67 with formula_68, formula_69\nDecidability.\nThe first-order theory of total orders is decidable, i.e. there is an algorithm for deciding which first-order statements hold for all total orders. Using interpretability in S2S, the monadic second-order theory of countable total orders is also decidable.\nOrders on the Cartesian product of totally ordered sets.\nThere are several ways to take two totally ordered sets and extend to an order on the Cartesian product, though the resulting order may only be partial. Here are three of these possible orders, listed such that each order is stronger than the next:\nEach of these orders extends the next in the sense that if we have \"x\" \u2264 \"y\" in the product order, this relation also holds in the lexicographic order, and so on. All three can similarly be defined for the Cartesian product of more than two sets.\nApplied to the vector space R\"n\", each of these make it an ordered vector space.\nSee also examples of partially ordered sets.\nA real function of \"n\" real variables defined on a subset of R\"n\" defines a strict weak order and a corresponding total preorder on that subset.\nRelated structures.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nA binary relation that is antisymmetric, transitive, and reflexive (but not necessarily total) is a partial order.\nA group with a compatible total order is a totally ordered group.\nThere are only a few nontrivial structures that are (interdefinable as) reducts of a total order. Forgetting the orientation results in a betweenness relation. Forgetting the location of the ends results in a cyclic order. Forgetting both data results use of point-pair separation to distinguish, on a circle, the two intervals determined by a point-pair.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "30332", "revid": "36878010", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30332", "title": "Strategic voting", "text": "Choosing a candidate other than preferred to undercut a less desired one\nStrategic or tactical voting is voting in consideration of possible ballots cast by other voters in order to maximize one's satisfaction with the election's results. \nGibbard's theorem shows that no voting system has a single \"always-best\" strategy, i.e. one that always maximizes a voter's satisfaction with the result, regardless of other voters' ballots. This implies all voting systems can sometimes encourage voters to strategize. However, weaker guarantees can be shown under stronger conditions. Examples include one-dimensional preferences (where the median rule is strategyproof) and dichotomous preferences (where approval or score voting are strategyproof).\nWith large electoral districts, party list methods tend to be difficult to manipulate in the absence of an electoral threshold. However, biased apportionment methods can create opportunities for strategic voting, as can small electoral districts (e.g. those used most often with the single transferable vote). Proportional representation systems with small districts often involve large-scale vote management operations, which are common in countries using STV-PR such as Ireland.\nCommon types of strategic voting.\nSome types of strategic voting described in the literature are:\n A voter ranks or rates a candidate they dislike \u2013 a \"lesser evil\" \u2013 higher in the hope of getting them elected, thus preventing an even worse candidate from being elected. This type of strategic voting includes the first-past-the-post strategy of voting for the lesser of two evils, as well as the more general \"favorite betrayal\" strategy.\n A sufficiently strong compromising incentive, possibly strengthened by a strategic exit incentive, can lead to or reinforce two-party rule as voters will abandon minor-party candidates to support stronger major-party candidates. This effect is called Duverger's law.\n \"Most affects:\" instant-runoff (RCV), two-round system, and (especially strong for) plurality.\n \"Also affected:\" Borda, Score, approval voting.prop. 4, note\n \"Immune:\" Coombs' method,prop. 4, note antiplurality, rated voting rules (e.g. score voting)\n A voter ranks or rates a candidate lower in the hope of defeating them. For example, a voter may insincerely rank or rate a perceived strong candidate last in order to help their preferred candidate win.\n Game theory arguments suggest that if burial incentive is sufficiently severe, a method may induce a race to the bottom. Each voter follows a strategy that, in isolation, helps their candidate win, but the result is that a candidate that nobody likes gets elected instead.\n \"Most affects:\" Borda, antiplurality.\n \"Also affected:\" Most Condorcet methods, with the exception of IRV-Condorcet hybrids.\n \"Immune:\" Instant-runoff voting and plurality voting.\n A voter gives a high rank to a weak (i.e. \"pushover\" or \"pied-piper\") candidate, but not with the intent of getting them elected. Instead, the voter intends for the weak candidate to eliminate a strong alternative, who would otherwise keep the voter's preferred candidate from winning. Party raiding is a well-known example of such a strategy.\n \"Most affects:\" Multi-round rules like instant-runoff, two-round, and primary elections.\n \"Immune:\" Plurality and all commonly-used rated voting systems, including score voting and approval voting.\n Compression is a strategy where a voter refuses to disclose which of two candidates they honestly prefer (i.e. both candidates are given the same rating or ranking). Compression is unique in that it does not involve a rank reversal: in compression, a voter who prefers A to B doesn't claim to prefer B to A, only that they're indifferent between them.\n The is most common in rated voting rules, where the optimal strategy often involves exaggerating the differences between candidates, assigning high-quality candidates a perfect score and low-quality candidates a score of zero.\n \"Most affects\": Rated voting.\n \"Immune:\" Random ballot and methods that require strict rankings. Plurality voting is immune to truncation.\n Technically a form of strategic \"non-voting\", strategic abstention can be used in no-show paradoxes. It is an especially widespread kind of strategy in the case of quorums, where a group of voters can prevent a law from passing by ensuring the turnout is too low to meet a certain threshold.\n \"Most affects\": Common in case of participation quorums, resulting in quorum-busting.\n \"Immune\": Point-summing systems (i.e. score voting and positional voting) or Rawls's method and its converse.\nFrequency and susceptibility.\nStrategic voting is highly dependent on the voting method being used. A strategic vote which improves a voter's satisfaction under one method could have no effect or be outright self-defeating under another method. Gibbard's theorem shows that no deterministic single-winner voting method can be completely immune to strategy, but makes no claims about the severity of strategy or how often strategy succeeds. Later results show that some methods are more manipulable than others.\nMichel Balinski and Rida Laraki, the inventors of the majority judgment method, performed an initial investigation of this question using a set of Monte Carlo simulated elections based on the results from a poll of the 2007 French presidential election which they had carried out using rated ballots. Comparing range voting, Borda count, plurality voting, approval voting with two different absolute approval thresholds, Condorcet voting, and majority judgment, they found that range voting had the highest (worst) strategic vulnerability, while their own method majority judgment had the lowest (best). Further investigation would be needed to be sure that this result remained true with different sets of candidates. \nParty-list proportional methods typically show less strategic voting, although the existence of electoral thresholds can lead voters to vote strategically to avoid wasted votes.\nMitigation.\nSwitching from a method that is highly manipulable to one that is more resistant would help discourage widespread strategic voting, all else equal.\nFrom a voting method, it's possible to design another voting method that attempts to strategize on behalf of the voter. Such methods are called \"declared strategy voting\" methods, and seek to improve a method's strategy resistance by moving the strategy into the method itself. DSV methods have been proposed for plurality voting, approval voting, and score voting.\nCoordination.\nThe nature of strategic voting requires some level of coordination. Because it is a system of voting that assesses outcomes before casting one's vote, coordination towards the outcome is a prerequisite for strategic voting. There must be some kind of coordination device in order to vote strategically. Coordination devices, though not the only device, are typically opinion polls. For example, if there was two similarly appealing majority candidates and a minority candidate and voters were given the choice between the three, polls are imperative to coordinating votes for either majority candidate. Polls are then a tool used by voters to ensure that the minority candidate doesn't obtain office, which would be adverse to Duverger's law. \nTactical voting may occur in isolation or as part of an organized campaign. In the former situation, electors make their own judgement as to the most effective way to (typically) prevent the election of a specific candidate or party. In the latter, one or more parties or groups encourage their supporters to vote tactically in an effort to influence the outcome. \nThe form that coordinated tactical voting takes depends largely on the electoral system of the polity. For example, vote thresholds in a proportional representation electoral system are found to prompt voters to coordinate their votes. For example, in the 2018 Swedish election, thresholds led voters who identified with a small party to consider the outcomes of their votes on the system of government as well as the other parties' outcomes. The voting history of the polity also influences coordination efforts: in proportional representation systems with little voting history, voters tend to vote more sincerely than engage in strategic voting due to the unknown nature of what party will be most viable. \nOrganized tactical voting in which a political party mounts a campaign calling on its supporters not to vote for their own favored candidates, but for those of a party which it perceives as more likely to defeat a common opponent, is less common. An example is the 1906 United Kingdom general election, where the Liberals (incidentally, the predecessors of the Liberal Democrats from the previous example) and the then-insurgent Labour Party (founded in 1900) agreed on the Gladstone-MacDonald pact, under which certain Liberal candidates would stand aside in favor of Labour ones, again to ensure that the Conservative candidates would not win on the basis of a split anti-Tory vote.\nAn intermediate case also exists, where a non-party campaign attempts to coordinate tactical voting, typically with the goal of defeating a certain party. Cases of this include the Canadian Anything But Conservative campaign, which opposed the Conservative Party of Canada in the 2008 and 2015 federal elections, or the Smart Voting campaign organized by Russia's Anti-Corruption Foundation with the goal of opposing and weakening the United Russia party in the 2021 Russian legislative election. This also occurred in the UK 2019 General Election, where voting groups such as Tactical Vote and Turf Out The Tories, promoted tactical voting to prevent a Conservative majority.\nExamples in real elections.\nCanada.\nThe observed effect of Duverger's law in Canada is weaker than in other countries. In the 1999 Ontario provincial election, strategic voting was encouraged by opponents of the Progressive Conservative government of Mike Harris. This failed to unseat Harris but succeeded in suppressing the Ontario New Democratic Party vote to a historic low.\nIn the 2004 federal election, and to a lesser extent in the 2006 election, strategic voting was a concern for the federal New Democratic Party (NDP). In the 2004 election, the governing Liberal Party was able to convince many New Democratic voters to vote Liberal to avoid a Conservative government. In the 2006 elections, the Liberal Party attempted the same strategy, with Prime Minister Paul Martin asking New Democrats and Greens to vote for the Liberal Party to prevent a Conservative win. The New Democratic Party leader Jack Layton responded by asking voters to \"lend\" their votes to his party, suggesting that the Liberal Party was bound to lose the election regardless of strategic voting. This failed to prevent the Conservatives from winning the election, although they did not win a majority of seats.\nDuring the 2015 federal election, strategic voting was used extensively against the Conservative government of Stephen Harper, which had benefited from vote splitting among centrist and left-leaning parties in the 2011 election. Following the landslide victory of the Liberals led by Justin Trudeau over Harper's Conservatives, experts argued that this dramatic increase in support for the Liberals at the expense of the NDP and Green Party was partially due to strategic voting for Liberal candidates. In three weeks, 1.4 million voters switched from NDP to Liberal. In at least two closely contested ridings, strategic voting websites obtained enough pledges to account for the victory margin of the Liberal candidate.\nFrance.\nThe two-round system in France shows strategic voting in the first round, due to considerations which candidate will reach the second round.\nGermany.\nThe mixed-member proportional representation allows to estimate the share of strategic voters in first-past-the-post voting due to the separate votes for party-lists and local single-winner electoral district candidates. The vote for party-lists is considered sincere if the party vote share is significantly above the 5% electoral threshold in Germany. In Germany the share of strategic voters was found around 30%, which decreased to 9% if only non-allied party candidates were contenders for the electoral district winner. In a contentious election year the share of strategic voters increased to around 45%.\nDue to electoral threshold in party-list proportional representation one party asked in several elections their voters to vote for another allied party to help this party cross the electoral threshold.\nHong Kong.\nIn Hong Kong, with its party-list proportional representation using largest remainder method with the Hare quota, voters supporting candidates of the pro-democracy camp often organize to divide their votes across different tickets, avoiding the concentration of votes on one or a few candidates. In 2016 Hong Kong Legislative Election, the practices of strategic voting were expanded by Benny Tai's Project ThunderGo. The anti-establishment camp gained 29 seats, a historical record.\nHungary.\nIn Hungary, during the 2018 Hungarian parliamentary election, several websites, such as taktikaiszavazas.hu (meaning \"strategic voting\"), promoted the idea to vote for opposition candidates with the highest probability of winning a given seat. About a quarter of opposition voters adopted this behavior, resulting in a total of 498,000 extra votes gained by opposition parties. A total of 14 extra single seats were taken by several parties and independent candidates.\nLithuania.\nIn Lithuania, which has a parallel voting system at parliamentary and district levels, most of strategic voting takes place in single-member constituencies (or districts in mayoral elections). These constituencies have two-round system when no candidate wins more than 50 per cent of the votes in the first round. A notable example of strategic voting at the parliamentary level could be the 10th Naujoji Vilnia constituency in 2016 Lithuanian parliamentary election. To prevent independent candidate Algirdas Paleckis' victory, the Liberal Movement's, the Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union's and the Social Democratic Party's candidates endorsed their supporters to vote for the Homeland Union's candidate Monika Navickien\u0117 (who came in second place). Monika Navickien\u0117 eventually won the constituency by around 900 votes. At a district level, an example could be K\u0117dainiai district's mayoral election in the 2015 municipal elections. In the first round, the Labour Party won 13 seats of 26 seats in district council and was just one seat short of absolute majority. Nijol\u0117 Naujokien\u0117 (candidate to the district's mayoral seat from the Labour Party) came short by 0.68 per cent in the mayoral election. Her opponent, Saulius Grinkevi\u010dius, had a 22 per cent gap to overcome. In the second round, Saulius Grinkevi\u010dius won by around 8 per cent (and 1,600 votes).\nNew Zealand.\nSince New Zealand moved to mixed-member proportional representation voting in 1996, the electoral system of New Zealand has seen strategic voting regularly occur in several elections, including one party explicitly or implicitly encouraging voters to vote for a candidate other than theirs. This happened first in 1996 in the Wellington Central, and then in 1999 in the Coromandel. From 1996 until 2005, it was a regular feature in the Ohariu-Belmont electorate, which was won by Peter Dunne throughout its existence and from 2005 in the Epsom electorate which has been won solely by the ACT party since 2005.\nPoland.\nIn the 2023 Polish parliamentary election, websites like pogonimypis.pl (meaning \"We'll chase the PiS\") gave information for which voters should vote for in their constituency in order to maximize the chance of the opposition winning the extra seat. The campaign was a success, with PiS losing the majority in the Sejm. At the same time, a referendum with the questions asked in a persuasive way took place, with the oppositing recommending to not take the referendal card. The voter turnout of the referendum is 40%, making it non-binding and merely a suggestion for all the future governments.\nSlovenia.\nAccording to some media, in the 2011 Slovenian parliamentary election, 30% of voters voted tactically. Public polls predicted an easy win for Janez Jan\u0161a, the candidate of the Slovenian Democratic Party; however, his opponent Zoran Jankovi\u0107, the candidate of Positive Slovenia, won. Prominent Slovenian public opinion researchers claimed that such proportions of strategic voting had not been recorded anywhere else before.\nSpain.\nIn the 2016 General Election in Spain, the incentives for voting tactically were much larger than usual, following the rise of the Podemos and Ciudadanos and following the economic crisis and election in 2015. The strategic voters successfully influenced the outcome of the election, despite a record low turnout of 66.5%. In a natural experiment in Andalusia 9% voted strategically when having opportunity, strategic behavior did not increase with time, and did not affect surrounding electoral areas, under the assumption that strategic voting happens only for district magnitude above 5.\nTaiwan.\nIn the 1995 Legislative Yuan election, strategic voting was implemented by the opposition parties, such as the Democratic Progressive Party and the New Party. As the members were elected in multi-member districts, the parties urged their supporters to vote for a party-nominated candidate according to criteria, such as the last digit of the voter's National Identification Card Number or the voter's birth month. This maximized the opposition's seat gains and resulted in the ruling Kuomintang losing 10 seats, receiving the lowest share of seats in history at the time.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn the 1997 UK general election, Democratic Left helped Bruce Kent set up GROT (Get Rid Of Them) a strategic voter campaign whose aim was to help prevent the Conservative Party from gaining a 5th term in office. This coalition was drawn from individuals in all the main opposition parties, and many who were not aligned with any party. While it is hard to prove that GROT swung the election itself, it did attract significant media attention and brought strategic voting into the mainstream for the first time in UK politics. In 2001, the Democratic Left's successor organisation, the New Politics Network, organised a similar campaign. Since then strategic voting has become a consideration in British politics as is reflected in by-elections and by the growth in sites such as tacticalvote.co.uk, who encourage strategic voting as a way of defusing the two party system and empowering the individual voter. For the 2015 UK general election, voteswap.org attempted to prevent the Conservative Party staying in government by encouraging Green Party supporters to tactically vote for the Labour Party in listed marginal seats. In 2017 swapmyvote.uk was formed to help supporters of all parties swap their votes with people in other constituencies.\nIn the 2006 local elections in London, strategic voting was promoted by sites such as London Strategic Voter in a response to national and international issues.\nIn Northern Ireland, it is believed that (predominantly Protestant) Unionist voters in Nationalist strongholds have voted for the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) to prevent Sinn F\u00e9in from capturing such seats. This conclusion was reached by comparing results to the demographics of constituencies and polling districts.\nIn the 2017 general election, it is estimated that 6.5 million people (more than 20% of voters) voted tactically either as a way of preventing a \"hard Brexit\" or preventing another Conservative government led by the Tactical2017 campaign. Many Green Party candidates withdrew from the race in order to help the Labour Party secure closely fought seats against the Conservatives. This ultimately led to the Conservatives losing seats in the election even though they increased their overall vote share.\nIn the 2019 Conservative Party leadership election to determine the final two candidates for the party vote, it was suggested that front-runner Boris Johnson's campaign encouraged some of its MPs to back Jeremy Hunt instead of Johnson, so that Hunt\u00a0\u2013 seen as \"a lower-energy challenger\"\u00a0\u2013 would finish in second place, allowing an easier defeat in the party vote. Strategic voting was expected to play a major role in the 2019 General Election, with a YouGov poll suggesting that 19% of voters would be doing so tactically. 49% of strategic voters said they would do so in the hope of stopping a party whose views they opposed.\nAccording to a 2020 study, older voters in the UK vote strategically more than younger voters, and richer voters vote more strategically than poorer voters.\nIn an example of individuals voting tactically, Labour voters in the 2022 Tiverton and Honiton by-election in the UK tactically supported the Liberal Democrat candidate in order to ensure the defeat of the Conservatives. This resulted in the Liberal Democrats winning what had previously been a Conservative safe seat.\nIn 2024, tactical voting was again advocated for the 2024 general election, as a means to defeat Conservative candidates in seats with traditional large Conservative majorities.\nUnited States.\nStrategic voting in the US's first-past-the-post voting and presidential system contributes to a two-party system, where the observed effect of Duverger's law is stronger than in most countries.\nIn 2000, 2016, and 2024, a significant number of voters in the Presidential elections opted to use vote swapping to increase Democratic turnout in swing states and third-party turnout in safe states.\nOne high-profile example of strategic voting was the 2002 California gubernatorial election. During the Republican primaries, Republicans Richard Riordan (former mayor of Los Angeles) and Bill Simon (a self-financed businessman) vied for a chance to compete against the unpopular incumbent Democratic Governor of California, Gray Davis. Polls predicted that Riordan would defeat Davis, while Simon would not. At that time, the Republican primaries were partially closed primaries in which non-partisans and registered Republicans could vote regardless of their party affiliation. Davis supporters (those were eligible to vote in the Republican primary) were rumored to have voted for Simon because Riordan was perceived as a greater threat to Davis; this, combined with a negative advertising campaign by Davis describing Riordan as a \"big-city liberal\", allowed Simon to win the primary despite a last-minute business scandal. The strategy to nominate Simon (if in fact it was a reality), was successful, as he lost in the general election against Davis. However, it resulted in the lowest gubernatorial general election turnout in modern California political history, thus requiring fewer signatures to qualify a recall that ultimately ousted Davis.\nSimilarly, in 2012, Claire McCaskill boosted Todd Akin in the 2012 US Senate election in Missouri. In addition to running ads highlighting Akin's conservative stances, McCaskill also directed messages to surrogates to tell Akin to run ads which would increase his primary polling.\nPuerto Rico.\nPuerto Rico's 2004 elections were affected by strategic voting. Pedro Rossell\u00f3, the New Progressive Party's candidate of that year, was unpopular across much of the territory due to large corruption schemes and the privatization of public corporations. To prevent Rossell from winning, other factions supported the Partido Popular Democratico's candidate. The elections were close; statehood advocates won a seat in the U.S. house of representatives and majorities in both legislative branches, but lost governance to An\u00edbal Acevedo Vil\u00e1. (Puerto Ricans have the chance to vote by party or by candidate. Separatists voted under their ideology but for the center party's candidate, which caused major turmoil.) After a recount and a trial, Acevedo Vil\u00e1 was certified as governor of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\nRational voter model.\nAnalysis of strategic voting is commonly based on a model of behavior where voters are \"short-term instrumentally rational\". That is, voters are only voting in order to make an impact on one election at a time (not, say, to build the political party for next election); voters have a set of sincere preferences, or utility rankings, by which to rate candidates; voters have some knowledge of each other's preferences; and voters understand how best to use strategic voting to their advantage. The extent to which this model resembles real-life elections is the subject of considerable academic debate.\nMyerson\u2013Weber strategy.\nAn example of a rational voter strategy is described by Myerson and Weber. The strategy is broadly applicable to a number of single-winner voting methods that are additive point methods, such as Plurality, Borda, Approval, and Range. The strategy is optimal in the sense that the strategy will maximize the voter's expected utility when the number of voters is sufficiently large.\nThis rational voter model assumes that the voter's utility of the election result is dependent only on which candidate wins and not on any other aspect of the election, for example showing support for a losing candidate in the vote tallies. The model also assumes the voter chooses how to vote individually and not in collaboration with other voters.\nGiven a set of \"k\" candidates and a voter let:\n \"vi\" = the number of points to be voted for candidate \"i\"\n \"ui\" = the voter's gain in utility if candidate \"i\" wins the election\n \"pij\" = the (voter's perceived) \"pivot probability\" that candidates \"i\" and \"j\" will be tied for the most total points to win the election.\nThen the voter's \"prospective rating\" for a candidate \"i\" is defined as:\n formula_1\nThe gain in expected utility for a given vote is given by:\n formula_2\nThe gain in expected utility can be maximized by choosing a vote with suitable values of \"vi\", depending on the voting method and the voter's prospective ratings for each candidate. For specific voting methods, the gain can be maximized using the following rules:\nPivot probabilities are rarely estimated in political forecasting, but can be estimated from predicted winning probabilities. An important special case occurs when the voter has no information about how other voters will vote. This is sometimes referred to as the \"zero information strategy\". In this special case, the \"pij\" pivot probabilities are all equal and the rules for the specific voting methods become:\nMyerson and Weber also describe voting equilibria that require all voters use the optimal strategy and all voters share a common set of \"pij\" pivot probabilities. Because of these additional requirements, such equilibria may in practice be less widely applicable than the strategies.\nPre-election influence.\nStrategic voting requires voters to be informed, as they can only gauge who is in the leading and who may not be a viable candidate through the information they are supplied. Because strategic voting relies heavily on voters' perception of how other voters intend to vote, campaigns in electoral methods that promote compromise frequently focus on affecting voters' perception of campaign viability. Most campaigns craft refined media strategies to shape the way voters see their candidacy. During this phase, there can be an analogous effect where campaign donors and activists may decide whether or not to support candidates tactically with their money and time.\nIn rolling elections, where some voters have information about previous voters' preferences (e.g. presidential primaries in the United States), candidates put disproportionate resources into competing strongly in the first few stages, because those stages affect the reaction of later stages.\nPerceived influence on other voters also interacts with strategic voting. In a study of the Israeli voting system, presumed media influence was found to be a variable in the case of why voters partake in strategic voting. Because the Israeli electoral system is complex, with many parties, and parliamentary, this perceived media influence effect may have a larger and more observable effect on simpler systems such as the one in the United States. \nGame theory has been used to search for some kind of \"minimally manipulable\" (incentive compatibility) voting schemes. Game theory can also be used to analyze the pros and cons of different methods. For instance, when electors vote for their own preferences rather than tactically, Condorcet method-like methods tend to settle on compromise candidates, while instant-runoff voting favors those candidates with strong core support but otherwise narrower appeal due to holding more uncompromising positions. Thus, Condorcet methods incentivize candidates to position themselves closer to the median voter and appeal to a wider section of the electorate than instant-runoff voting does.\nBy method.\nPlurality voting.\nLesser-evil voting is exceedingly common in plurality elections, where the first preference is all that counts (and thus lesser-evil voting is the only effective kind of strategic voting). The most typical tactic is to assess which two candidates are frontrunners (most likely to win) and to vote for the preferred one of those two, even if a third candidate is preferred over both. Duverger's law is the observation that this kind of strategic voting and strategic nomination is sufficiently common for any method based on first preferences to produce two-party domination.\nPlurality-runoff family (RCV, two-round, and partisan primaries).\nTheoretical results indicate that, under two-round runoff voting with three candidates, strategic equilibria exist in which only two candidates receive votes. It has been shown experimentally that voters are influenced by a candidate's perceived likelihood of winning the election.\nInstant runoff voting is vulnerable to three of the four kinds of strategy discussed above. It is vulnerable to lesser-evil voting; to turkey-raising; and to strategic truncation.\nThere is a common misconception that instant-runoff is not affected by a kind of strategic voting called truncation or bullet voting. However, satisfying later-no-harm does not (by itself) provide resistance to such strategies, unless paired with the participation criterion. Systems like instant runoff that pass later-no-harm but fail participation still incentivize truncation or bullet voting in some situations.\nCardinal single-winner voting.\nMost cardinal, single-winner voting systems in large elections encourage similar strategies:\nSuch a strategy involves \"semi-honest exaggeration\". Unlike in most voting systems, voters rarely (if ever) have an incentive to lie about which of two candidates they prefer; instead, voters exaggerate the difference between a certain pair of candidates without ranking any less-preferred candidate over any more-preferred one. \nTypically, this would not be the case unless there were two similar candidates favored by the same set of voters. A strategic vote against a similar rival could result in a favored candidate winning; although if voters for both similar rivals used this strategy, it could cause a candidate favored by neither of these voter groups to win.\nBalinski and Laraki noted that under majority judgment, many voters (about half) have no opportunity or incentive to use strategy. They argued based on a simulation that the highest median methods minimized the number of voters with an incentive to misrepresent their opinions, among the methods they studied. Exaggeration in majority judgment has an effect whenever the voter's honest rating for the intended winner is below that candidate's median rating; or when their honest rating for the intended loser is above it. In other words, half of voters will have an incentive to strategize, while half will not.\nStrategic voters are faced with the initial tactic as to how highly to score their second-choice candidate. The voter may want to retain expression of a high preference of their favorite candidate over their second choice. But that does not allow the same voter to express a high preference of their second choice over any others.\nIn approval voting, because the only option is to approve of a candidate or not, optimal strategic voting rarely includes approving a less-preferred candidate but not a more-preferred one. However, strategy is in fact inevitable when a voter decides their \"approval cutoff\". Steven Brams and Dudley R. Herschbach argued in a paper in \"Science\" magazine in 2001 that approval voting was the method least amenable to tactical perturbations.\nBalinski and Laraki used rated ballots from a poll of the 2007 French presidential election to show that, if unstrategic voters only approved candidates whom they considered \"very good\" or better, strategic voters would be able to sway the result frequently, but that if unstrategic voters approved all candidates they considered \"good\" or better, approval was the second most strategy-resistant method of the ones they studied, after majority judgment itself.\nRanked single-winner voting.\nThe Borda count has both a strong incentive and a large vulnerability to burial. Here is a hypothetical example of both factors at the same time: if there are two candidates the most likely to win, the voter can maximize the impact on the contest between these candidates by ranking the candidate the voter likes more in first place, ranking the candidate whom they like less in last place. If neither candidate is the sincere first or last choice, the voter is using both the compromising and burying strategies at once. If many different groups voters use this strategy, this gives a paradoxical advantage to the candidate generally thought least likely to win.\nCondorcet.\nCondorcet methods are vulnerable to 3 of the 4 kinds of strategy listed above, because the Condorcet winner criterion is incompatible with the sincere favorite criterion, participation criterion, later-no-harm, and later-no-help. Strategy in Condorcet methods can become highly complex, but almost always involves burial or truncation.\nMulti-winner voting.\nSingle transferable vote.\nThe single transferable vote may incentivize free-riding: if a voter expects their favorite candidate will almost-certainly be elected, insincerely ranking the second candidate first does not hurt the favored candidate.\nSome forms of STV allow strategic voters to gain an advantage by listing a candidate who is very likely to lose in first place. This strategy, called \"Woodall free riding\", is essentially eliminated by Meek's method; however, Meek's method is rarely used because of its substantial complexity, having been adopted only for some local elections in New Zealand.\nIn Malta's STV, the two-party system can cause strategic voting away from third parties."}

This order has been classified as a suborder of the order Perciformes, although recent studies have found that it, as the Tetraodontoidei, is a sister taxon to the anglerfish order Lophiiformes, called Lophiodei, and have placed both taxa within the Acanthuriformes. The Tetraodontiformes are represented by 10 extant families and at around 430 species overall. The majority of the species within this order are marine but a few may be found in freshwater. They are found throughout the world.\nTaxonomy.\nTetraodontiformes is a name first used for this order in 1940 by Lev Berg, the order was originally proposed in 1817 as the \"Les Plectognathes\", the Plectognathi. Cuvier divided this into two families \"Les Gymnodontes\" and \"Les Sclerodermes\". In 1940 Berg first used the term Tetraodontiformes for this order and this name is the currently accepted name as it follows the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature rule that a name for a family or higher taxa must have its root based on the type species of that grouping. In this case the type species is \"Tetraodon lineatus\" Linnaeus, 1758. The 5th edition of \"Fishes of the World\" recognises the order as a derived order within the Actinopterygii and as a monophyletic order within the Percomorpha. Other authorities have proposed that it is not an order but that it is a clade, the Tetraodontoidei, within the order Acanthuriformes and is most closely related to the Lophiodei, the anglerfishes.\nEtymology.\nThe name comes from Ancient Greek \u03c4\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1- (\"tetra-\"), meaning \"four\", \u1f40\u03b4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2 (\"odo\u00fas\"), meaning \"tooth\", and Latin \"formes\", meaning \"form\".\nEvolution.\nTraditionally, the oldest recognized tetraodontiforms are the extinct suborder Plectocretacicoidei from the Late Cretaceous (Santonian to Campanian) of Italy and Slovenia, both in the former Tethyan region. These comprise the families Cretatriacanthidae and Protriacanthidae. \"Plectocretacicus\" from the Cenomanian of Lebanon has also been proposed as a tetraodontiform, but this has been more recently questioned. More recent studies have also questioned the placement of the Plectrocretacicoidei in the Tetraodontiformes, due to their ancient nature contrasting with the position of the Tetraodontiformes as the most derived percomorph lineage, and the group displaying many traits that are not present in modern tetraodontiforms or are not exclusively found in them. It has thus been suggested that the Plectocretacicoidei might either represent indeterminate percomorphs or basal members of a more inclusive Acanthuriformes. If the Plectocretacicoidei are excluded, the earliest definitive fossil tetraodontiforms are a number of genera known from the earliest Eocene.\nDescription.\nTetraodontiformes include a variety of body shapes, all radical departures from the streamlined body plan typical of most fishes. These forms range from nearly square or triangular (boxfishes), globose (pufferfishes) to laterally compressed (filefishes and triggerfishes). They range in size from \"Rudarius excelsus\" (a filefish), measuring just in length, to the ocean sunfish, the largest of all bony fishes at up to in length and weighing over 2 tonnes.\nMost members of this order \u2013 except for the family Balistidae \u2013 are ostraciiform swimmers, meaning the body is rigid and incapable of lateral flexure. Because of this, they are slow-moving and rely on their pectoral, dorsal, anal, and caudal fins for propulsion rather than body undulation. However, movement is usually quite precise; dorsal and anal fins aid in manoeuvring and stabilizing. In most species, all fins are simple, small, and rounded, except for the pelvic fins which, if present, are fused and buried. Again, in most members, the gill plates are covered over with skin, the only gill opening a small slit above the pectoral fin.\nThe tetraodontiform strategy seems to be defense at the expense of speed, with all species fortified with scales modified into strong plates or spines \u2013 or with tough, leathery skin (the filefishes and ocean sunfish). Another striking defensive attribute found in the pufferfishes and porcupinefishes is the ability to inflate their bodies to greatly increase their normal diameter; this is accomplished by sucking water into a diverticulum of the stomach. Many species of the Tetraodontidae, Triodontidae, and Diodontidae are further protected from predation by tetrodotoxin, a powerful neurotoxin concentrated in the animals' internal organs.\nTetraodontiforms have highly modified skeletons, with no nasal, parietal, infraorbital, or (usually) lower rib bones. The bones of the jaw are modified and fused into a sort of \"beak\"; visible sutures divide the beaks into \"teeth\". This is alluded to in their name, derived from the Greek words ' meaning \"four\" and ' meaning \"tooth\" and the Latin \"forma\" meaning \"shape\". Counting these teeth-like bones is a way of distinguishing similar families, for example, the Tetraodontidae (\"four-toothed\"), Triodontidae (\"three-toothed\"), and Diodontidae (\"two-toothed\").\nTheir jaws are aided by powerful muscles, and many species also have pharyngeal teeth to further process prey items, because the Tetraodontiformes prey mostly on hard-shelled invertebrates, such as crustaceans and shellfish.\nThe Molidae are conspicuous even within this oddball order; they lack swim bladders and spines, and are propelled by their very tall dorsal and anal fins. The caudal peduncle is absent and the caudal fin is reduced to a stiff rudder-like structure. Molids are pelagic rather than reef-associated and feed on soft-bodied invertebrates, especially jellyfish.\nFamilies.\nThe Tetraodontiformes contains the following suborders and families, based on \"Eschmeyer's Catalog of Fishes\" and Santini &amp; Tyler (2003):\nFossil taxa.\nBased on Santini &amp; Tyler (2003):\nThis cladogram of extant Tetraodontiformes is based on Santini et al., 2013.\nThis cladogram of extant Tetraodontiformes is based on Santini et al., 2013.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are often used by writers to help find the best word to express an idea:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...to find the word, or words, by which [an] idea may be most fitly and aptly expressed\u2014\u200a\nSynonym dictionaries have a long history. The word 'thesaurus' was used in 1852 by Peter Mark Roget for his \"Roget's Thesaurus\".\nWhile some works called \"thesauri\", such as \"Roget's Thesaurus\", group words in a hierarchical hypernymic taxonomy of concepts, others are organised alphabetically or in some other way.\nMost thesauri do not include definitions, but many dictionaries include listings of synonyms.\nSome thesauri and dictionary synonym notes characterise the distinctions between similar words, with notes on their \"connotations and varying shades of meaning\". Some synonym dictionaries are primarily concerned with differentiating synonyms by meaning and usage. Usage manuals such as Fowler's \"Dictionary of Modern English Usage\" or \"Garner's Modern English Usage\" often prescribe appropriate usage of synonyms.\nWriters sometimes use thesauri to avoid repetition of words \u2013 elegant variation \u2013 which is often criticised by usage manuals: \"Writers sometimes use them not just to vary their vocabularies but to dress them up too much\".\nEtymology.\nThe word \"thesaurus\" comes from Latin \"th\u0113saurus\", which in turn comes from Ancient Greek (\"th\u0113sauros\") 'treasure, treasury, storehouse'. The word \"th\u0113sauros\" is of uncertain etymology.\nUntil the 19th century, a thesaurus was any dictionary or encyclopedia, as in the \"Thesaurus Linguae Latinae\" (\"Dictionary of the Latin Language\", 1532), and the \"Thesaurus Linguae Graecae\" (\"Dictionary of the Greek Language\", 1572). It was Roget who introduced the meaning \"collection of words arranged according to sense\", in 1852.\nHistory.\nThe Ancient Greek author Philo of Byblos in classical antiquity authored the first text that could now be called a thesaurus.\nIn Sanskrit the \"Amarakosha\" is a thesaurus in verse form, written in the 4th century.\nThe study of synonyms became an important theme in 18th-century philosophy, and \u00c9tienne Bonnot de Condillac wrote, but never published, a dictionary of synonyms.\nSome early synonym dictionaries include:\n\"Roget's Thesaurus\", first compiled in 1805 by Peter Mark Roget, and published in 1852, follows John Wilkins' semantic arrangement of 1668. Unlike earlier synonym dictionaries, it does not include definitions or aim to help the user choose among synonyms. It has been continuously in print since 1852 and remains widely used across the English-speaking world. Roget described his thesaurus in the foreword to the first edition:\nIt is now nearly fifty years since I first projected a system of verbal classification similar to that on which the present work is founded. Conceiving that such a compilation might help to supply my deficiencies, I had, in the year 1805, completed a classed catalogue of words on a small scale, but on the same principle, and nearly in the same form, as the Thesaurus now published.\nOrganization.\nConceptual.\nRoget's original thesaurus was organized into 1000 conceptual Heads (e.g., 806 Debt) organized into a four-level taxonomy. For example, debt is classed under V.ii.iv:\nClass five, \"Volition: the exercise of the will\"\nDivision Two: \"Social volition\"\nSection 4: \"Possessive Relations\"\nSubsection 4: \"Monetary relations\".\nEach head includes direct synonyms: Debt, obligation, liability, ...; related concepts: interest, usance, usury; related persons: debtor, debitor, ... defaulter (808); verbs: to be in debt, to owe, ... \"see\" Borrow (788); phrases: to run up a bill or score, ...; and adjectives: in debt, indebted, owing, ... Numbers in parentheses are cross-references to other Heads.\nThe book starts with a Tabular Synopsis of Categories laying out the hierarchy, then the main body of the thesaurus listed by the Head, and then an alphabetical index listing the different Heads under which a word may be found: Liable, \"subject to\", 177; \"debt\", 806; \"duty\", 926.\nSome recent versions have kept the same organisation, though often with more detail under each Head. Others have made modest changes such as eliminating the four-level taxonomy and adding new heads: one has 1075 Heads in fifteen Classes.\nSome non-English thesauri have also adopted this model.\nIn addition to its taxonomic organisation, the \"Historical Thesaurus of English\" (2009) includes the date when each word came to have a given meaning. It has the novel and unique goal of \"charting the semantic development of the huge and varied vocabulary of English\".\nDifferent senses of a word are listed separately. For example, three different senses of \"debt\" are listed in three different places in the taxonomy:\nA sum of money that is owed or due; a liability or obligation to pay\nSociety\nTrade and Finance\nManagement of Money\nInsolvency\nIndebtedness [noun]\nAn immaterial debt; is an obligation to do something\nSociety\nMorality\nDuty or obligation\n[noun]\nAn offence requiring expiation (figurative, Biblical)\nSociety\nFaith\nAspects of faith\nSpirituality\nSin\n[noun]\ninstance of\nAlphabetical.\nOther thesauri and synonym dictionaries are organised alphabetically.\nMost repeat the list of synonyms under each word.\nSome designate a principal entry for each concept and cross-reference it.\nA third system interfiles words and conceptual headings. Francis March's \"Thesaurus Dictionary\" gives for \"liability\": CONTINGENCY, CREDIT\u2013DEBT, DUTY\u2013DERELICTION, LIBERTY\u2013SUBJECTION, MONEY, each of which is a conceptual heading. The CREDIT\u2014DEBT article has multiple subheadings, including Nouns of Agent, Verbs, Verbal Expressions, \"etc.\" Under each are listed synonyms with brief definitions, \"e.g.\" \"Credit. Transference of property on promise of future payment.\" The conceptual headings are not organized into a taxonomy.\nBenjamin Lafaye's \"Synonymes fran\u00e7ais\" (1841) is organised around morphologically related families of synonyms (\"e.g.\" \"logis, logement\"), and his \"Dictionnaire des synonymes de la langue fran\u00e7aise\" (1858) is mostly alphabetical, but also includes a section on morphologically related synonyms, which is organised by prefix, suffix, or construction.\nContrasting senses.\nBefore Roget, most thesauri and dictionary synonym notes included discussions of the differences among near-synonyms, as do some modern ones.\n\"Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Synonyms\" is a stand-alone modern English synonym dictionary that does discuss differences. In addition, many general English dictionaries include synonym notes.\nSeveral modern synonym dictionaries in French are \"primarily\" devoted to discussing the precise demarcations among synonyms.\nAdditional elements.\nSome include short definitions.\nSome give illustrative phrases.\nSome include lists of objects within the category (hyponyms), \"e.g.\" breeds of dogs.\nBilingual.\nBilingual synonym dictionaries are designed for language learners. One such dictionary gives various French words listed alphabetically, with an English translation and an example of use.

{"id": "30337", "revid": "196446", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30337", "title": "Trial of Socrates", "text": "399 B.C. legal proceedings by the pantheon of Athens against Socrates\nThe Trial of Socrates (399 BC) was held to determine the philosopher's guilt of two charges: \"asebeia\" (impiety) against the pantheon of Athens, and corruption of the youth of the city-state; the accusers cited two impious acts by Socrates: \"failing to acknowledge the gods that the city acknowledges\" and \"introducing new deities\".\nThe death sentence of Socrates was the legal consequence of asking politico-philosophic questions of his students, which resulted in the two accusations of moral corruption and impiety. At trial, the majority of the \"dikasts\" (male-citizen jurors chosen by lot) voted to convict him of the two charges; then, consistent with common legal practice, they voted to determine his punishment and agreed to a sentence of death to be executed by Socrates's drinking a poisonous beverage of hemlock.\nOf all the works written about Socrates' trial, only three survive: Plato's \"Apology\", Xenophon's \"Apology\", and Xenophon's \"Memorabilia\". Primary-source accounts of the trial and execution of Socrates are the \"Apology of Socrates\" by Plato and the \"Apology of Socrates to the Jury\" by Xenophon of Athens, both of whom had been his students; modern interpretations include \"The Trial of Socrates\" (1988) by the journalist I. F. Stone, \"Why Socrates Died: Dispelling the Myths\" (2009) by the Classics scholar Robin Waterfield, and \"The Shadows of Socrates: The Heresy, War, and Treachery behind the Trial of Socrates\" (2024) by the scholar Matt Gatton.\nBackground.\nBefore the philosopher Socrates was tried for moral corruption and impiety, the citizens of Athens knew him as an intellectual and moral gadfly of their society. In the comic play, \"The Clouds\" (423 BC), Aristophanes represents Socrates as a sophistic philosopher who teaches the young man Pheidippides how to formulate arguments that justify striking and beating his father. Despite Socrates denying he had any relation with the Sophists, the playwright indicates that Athenians associated the philosophic teachings of Socrates with Sophism. As philosophers, the Sophists were men of ambiguous reputation, \"they were a set of charlatans that appeared in Greece in the fifth century BC, and earned ample livelihood by imposing on public credulity: professing to teach virtue, they really taught the art of fallacious discourse, and meanwhile propagated immoral practical doctrines.\"\nBesides \"The Clouds\", the comic play \"The Wasps\" (422 BC) also depicts inter-generational conflict, between an older man and a young man. Such representations of inter-generational social conflict among the men of Athens, especially in the decade from 425 to 415 BC, can reflect contrasting positions regarding opposition to or support for the Athenian invasion of Sicily. Many Athenians blamed the teachings of the Sophists and of Socrates for instilling the younger generation with a morally nihilistic, disrespectful attitude towards their society.\nSocrates left no written works; however, his student and friend, Plato, wrote Socratic dialogues, featuring Socrates as the protagonist. As a teacher, competitor intellectuals resented Socrates's \"elenctic examination\" method for intellectual inquiry, because its questions threatened their credibility as men of wisdom and virtue.\nIt has sometimes been claimed that Socrates described himself as the \"gadfly\" of Athens which, like a sluggish horse, needed to be aroused by his \"stinging\". In the Greek text of his defense given by Plato, Socrates never actually uses that term (viz., \"gadfly\" [Grk., \"o\u00eestros\"]) to describe himself. Rather, his reference is merely allusive, as he (literally) says only that he has attached himself to the City (\"proskeimenon t\u0113 polei\") in order to sting it. Nevertheless, he does make the bold claim that he is a god's gift to the Athenians.\nSocrates's elenctic method was often imitated by the young men of Athens.\nAssociation with Alcibiades and the Thirty Tyrants.\nAlcibiades was an Athenian general who had been the main proponent of the disastrous Sicilian Expedition during the Peloponnesian Wars, where virtually the entire Athenian invading force of more than 50,000 soldiers and non-combatants (e.g., the rowers of the Triremes) was killed or captured and enslaved. He was a student and close friend of Socrates, and his messmate during the siege of Potidaea (433\u2013429 BC). Socrates remained Alcibiades's close friend, admirer, and mentor for about five or six years.\nHis complex friendship with Socrates was put on display during Alcibiades' speech at the Symposium, where he both praised Socrates and also disclosed his emotional turmoil and humiliation because of his personal desires. Alcibiades accused Socrates of arrogance during what he framed as a \"trial\", using the audience as a jury to judge Socrates' pride. Yet, Socrates remained silent, demonstrating the self-control that challenged Alcibiades' values. Alcibiades admitted this created an inner conflict, as Socrates' teachings inspired a shift in thinking toward focusing on one's inner character over their outward success. In this way, the \"first trial\" of Socrates serves as a powerful metaphor for the philosophical and personal challenges he posed to the traditional Athenian values, foreshadowing the tensions that would later lead to his formal trial.\nAnother possible source of resentment was the political views that he and his associates were thought to have embraced. Critias, who appears in two of Plato's Socratic dialogues, was a leader of the Thirty Tyrants (the ruthless oligarchic regime that ruled Athens, as puppets of Sparta and backed by Spartan troops, for eight months in 404\u2013403 BC until they were overthrown). Several of the Thirty had been students of Socrates, but there is also a record of their falling out.\nAs with many of the issues surrounding Socrates's conviction, the nature of his affiliation with the Thirty Tyrants is far from straightforward. During the reign of the Thirty, many prominent Athenians who were opposed to the new government left Athens. Robin Waterfield asserts that \"Socrates would have been welcome in oligarchic Thebes, where he had close associates among the Pythagoreans who flourished there, and which had already taken in other exiles.\" Given the availability of a hospitable host outside of Athens, Socrates, at least in a limited way, chose to remain in Athens. Thus, Waterfield suggests, Socrates's contemporaries probably thought his remaining in Athens, even without participating in the Thirty's bloodthirsty schemes, demonstrated his sympathy for the Thirty's cause, not neutrality towards it. This is proved, Waterfield argues, by the fact that after the Thirty were no longer in power, anyone who had remained in Athens during their rule was encouraged to move to Eleusis, the new home of the expatriate Thirty. Socrates did oppose the will of the Thirty on one documented occasion. Plato's \"Apology\" has the character of Socrates describe that the Thirty ordered him, along with four other men, to fetch a man named Leon of Salamis so that the Thirty could execute him. While Socrates did not obey this order, he did nothing to warn Leon, who was subsequently apprehended by the other four men.\nSupport of oligarchic rule and contempt for Athenian democracy.\nAccording to the portraits left by some of Socrates's followers, Socrates himself seems to have openly espoused certain anti-democratic views, the most prominent perhaps being the view that it is not majority opinion that yields correct policy but rather genuine knowledge and professional competence, which is possessed by only a few. Plato also portrays him as being severely critical of some of the most prominent and well-respected leaders of the Athenian democracy; and even has his claim that the officials selected by the Athenian system of governance cannot credibly be regarded as benefactors since it is not any group of \"many\" that benefits, but only \"someone or very few persons\". Finally, Socrates was known as often praising the laws of the undemocratic regimes of Sparta and Crete. Plato himself reinforced anti-democratic ideas in \"The Republic\", advocating rule by elite, enlightened \"Philosopher-Kings\".\nThe totalitarian Thirty Tyrants had anointed themselves as the elite, and in the minds of his Athenian accusers, Socrates was guilty because he was suspected of introducing oligarchic ideas to them. Larry Gonick, in his \"Cartoon History of the Universe\" wrote: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nApart from his views on politics, Socrates held unusual views on religion. He made several references to his spirit, or \"daimonion\", although he explicitly claimed that it never urged him on, but only warned him against various prospective actions.\nHistorical descriptions of the trial.\nThe extant, primary sources about the history of the trial and execution of Socrates are: the \"Apology of Socrates to the Jury\", by Xenophon, a historian and philosopher; and the tetralogy of Socratic dialogues\u00a0\u2013 \"Euthyphro\", the \"Socratic Apology\", \"Crito\", and \"Phaedo\", by Plato, a philosopher who had been a student of Socrates.\nIn \"The Indictment of Socrates\" (392 BC), the sophist rhetorician Polycrates (440\u2013370) presents the prosecution speech by Anytus, which condemned Socrates for his political and religious activities in Athens before the year 403 BC. In presenting such a prosecution, which addressed matters external to the specific charges of moral corruption and impiety levelled by the Athenian \"polis\" against Socrates, Anytus violated the political amnesty specified in the agreement of reconciliation (403\u2013402 BC), which granted pardon to a man for political and religious actions taken before or during the rule of the Thirty Tyrants, \"under which all further charges and official recriminations concerning the [reign of] terror were forbidden\".\nMoreover, the legal and religious particulars against Socrates that Polycrates reported in \"The Indictment of Socrates\" are addressed in the replies by Xenophon and the sophist Libanius of Antioch (314\u2013390).\nTrial.\nThe formal accusation was the second element of the trial of Socrates, which the accuser, Meletus, swore to be true, before the archon (a state officer with mostly religious duties) who considered the evidence and determined that there was an actionable case of \"moral corruption of Athenian youth\" and \"impiety\", for which the philosopher must legally answer; the archon summoned Socrates for a trial by jury.\nAthenian juries were drawn by lottery, from a group of hundreds of male-citizen volunteers; such a great jury usually ensured a majority verdict in a trial. Although neither Plato nor Xenophon of Athens identifies the number of jurors, a jury of 501 men likely was the legal norm. In the \"Apology of Socrates\" (36a\u2013b), about Socrates's defence at trial, Plato said that if just 30 of the votes had been otherwise, then Socrates would have been acquitted (36a), and that (perhaps) less than three-fifths of the jury voted against him (36b). Assuming a jury of 501, this would imply that he was convicted by a majority of 280 against 221. The citizens were in a state of fear because of the past war and plagues they feared to anger their gods again because of Socrates, so this context can help in understanding the state of mind of some jurors when giving their verdict.\nHaving been found guilty of corruption and impiety, Socrates and the prosecutor suggested sentences for the punishment of his crimes against the city-state of Athens. Expressing surprise at the few votes required for an acquittal, Socrates joked that he be punished with free meals at the Prytaneum (the city's sacred hearth), an honour usually held for a benefactor of Athens, and the victorious athletes of an Olympiad. After that failed suggestion, Socrates then offered to pay a fine of 100 drachmae\u00a0\u2013 one-fifth of his property\u00a0\u2013 which largesse testified to his integrity and poverty as a philosopher. Finally, a fine of 3,000 drachmae was agreed, proposed by Plato, Crito, Critobulus, and Apollodorus, who guaranteed payment\u00a0\u2013 nonetheless, the prosecutor of the trial of Socrates proposed the death penalty for the impious philosopher. (Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, 2.42). In the end, the sentence of death was passed by a greater majority of the jury than that by which he had been convicted.\nIn the event, friends, followers, and students encouraged Socrates to flee Athens, an action which the citizens expected; yet, on principle, Socrates refused to flout the law and escape his legal responsibility to Athens (see: \"Crito\"). Therefore, faithful to his teaching of civic obedience to the law, the 70-year-old Socrates executed his death sentence and drank the hemlock, as condemned at trial. (See: \"Phaedo\")\nDeath.\nThe death of Socrates is presented in the Platonic diaologue the Phaedo, in which Socrates and his friends discuss the immortality of the soul before Socrates drinks the hemlock poison given to him for his execution.\nIn the \"Phaedo\" the poison given to Socrates is not identified by name, but is called (to pharmakon), \"the drug\". Because of this and the differences in symptoms between various species called (k\u014dneion, hemlock in Greek) or (hemlock in Latin) the identification of poison hemlock as the plant used in the execution has been the subject of debate.\nIn 1679 the Swiss physician Johann Jakob Wepfer published \"Cicutae aquaticae historia et noxae\". In it he describes the symptoms of eight children who had eaten the roots of water hemlock. He expressed doubts that hemlock could have been the \"cold\" poison used in the execution of Socrates as the symptoms were of a \"hot\" poison with seizures, arched backs, and foaming at the mouth. Wepfer was unaware that the \"Cicuta\" he was studying was not the same plant used in Athenian executions.\nThe English physician and botanist John Harley worked with a preparation of hemlock called \"succus conii\", testing it on himself and recording the effects in his book \"The Old Vegetable Neurotics\" published in 1869. The symptoms he recorded were identical to the initial stages described in the \"Phaedo\".\n An hour and a quarter after taking the dose, I first felt decided weakness in my legs. The giddiness and diminution of motor power continued to increase for the next fifteen minutes. An hour and a half after taking the dose, these effects attained their maximum; and at this time I was cold, pale, and tottering. ... The mind remained perfectly clear and calm, and the brain active throughout; but the body seemed heavy, and well-nigh asleep.\nIn the \"Phado\":\n ...and he walked about until, as he said, his legs began to fail, and then he lay on his back, according to the directions, and the man who gave him the poison now and then looked at his feet and legs; and after a while he pressed his foot hard and asked him if he could feel; and he said, no; and then his leg, and so upwards and upwards, and showed us that he was cold and stiff. And he felt them himself, and said: When the poison reaches the heart, that will be the end. He was beginning to grow cold about the groin, when he uncovered his face, for he had covered himself up, and said (they were his last words)\u2014he said: Crito, I owe a cock to Asclepius; will you remember to pay the debt? The debt shall be paid, said Crito; is there anything else? There was no answer to this question; but in a minute or two a movement was heard, and the attendants uncovered him; his eyes were set, and Crito closed his eyes and mouth.\nIn the 1970s the accuracy of the description was questioned by the classicist Christopher Gill and the pathologist William Ober. Gill argued that the scene was adjusted by Plato to present, either for dramatic or philosophic purposes, a quiet and dignified end. He wrote, \"The quietness, the calmness, the regularity of the effects of the penetration of the poison into Socrates' body (so different from the chaos, squalor, and collapse described by Nicander and modern toxicologies) is the quietness of a ritual, the \"katharmos\" or purification of the soul from the prison of the body.\" In the early 2000s Enid Bloch's paper reviewing the available evidence and concluded that these arguments resulted from confusion between different species commonly called hemlock.\nInterpretations of the trial of Socrates.\nAncient.\nIn the time of the trial of Socrates, the year 399 BC, the city-state of Athens recently had endured the trials and tribulations of Spartan hegemony and the 13-month r\u00e9gime of the Thirty Tyrants, which had been imposed consequently to the Athenian defeat in the Peloponnesian War (431\u2013404 BC). At the request of Lysander, a Spartan admiral, the Thirty men, led by Critias and Theramenes, were to administer Athens and revise the city's democratic laws, which were inscribed on a wall of the Stoa Basileios. Their actions were to facilitate the transition of the Athenian government from a democracy to an oligarchy in service to Sparta.\nMoreover, the Thirty Tyrants also appointed a council of 500 men to perform the judicial functions that once had belonged to every Athenian citizen. In their brief r\u00e9gime, the pro-Spartan oligarchs killed about five percent of the Athenian population, confiscated much property, and exiled democrats from the city proper. The fact that Critias, leader of the Thirty Tyrants, had been a pupil of Socrates was held against him.\nPlato's presentation of the trial and death of Socrates inspired writers, artists, and philosophers to revisit the matter. For some, the execution of the man whom Plato called \"the wisest and most just of all men\" demonstrated the defects of democracy and of popular rule; for others, the Athenian actions were a justifiable defence of the recently re-established democracy.\nIn 73 AD, Syrian Stoic philosopher Mara bar Serapion wrote of the death of the \"three wise men\": which included Pythagoras, \"the wise king\" of the Jews, and Socrates. Serapion criticized the treatment of each of them as unjust and oppressive.\nModern.\nIn \"The Trial of Socrates\" (1988), I. F. Stone argued that Socrates wanted to be sentenced to death, to justify his philosophic opposition to the Athenian democracy of that time, and because, as a man, he saw that old age would be an unpleasant time for him.\nIn the introduction to his play \"Socrates on Trial\" (2007), Andrew Irvine claimed that because of his loyalty to Athenian democracy, Socrates willingly accepted the guilty verdict voted by the jurors at his trial: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;During a time of war, and great social and intellectual upheaval, Socrates felt compelled to express his views, openly, regardless of the consequences. As a result, he is remembered today, not only for his sharp wit and high ethical standards, but also for his loyalty to the view that, in a democracy, the best way for a man to serve himself, his friends, and his city\u00a0\u2013 even during times of war\u00a0\u2013 is by being loyal to, and by speaking publicly about the truth.\nIn \"Why Socrates Died: Dispelling the Myths\" (2009), Robin Waterfield wrote that the death of Socrates was an act of volition motivated by a greater purpose; Socrates \"saw himself as healing the City's ills by his voluntary death\". Waterfield wrote that Socrates, with his unconventional methods of intellectual enquiry, attempted to resolve the political confusion then occurring in the city-state of Athens, by willingly being the scapegoat, whose death would quiet old disputes, which then would allow the Athenian polis to progress towards political harmony and social peace.\nIn \"The New Trial of Socrates\" (2012), an international panel of ten judges held a mock re-trial of Socrates to resolve the matter of the charges levelled against him by Meletus, Anytus, and Lycon, that: \"Socrates is a doer of evil and corrupter of the youth, and he does not believe in the gods of the state, and he believes in other new divinities of his own\". Five judges voted guilty and five judges voted not guilty. Limiting themselves to the facts of the case against Socrates, the judges did not consider any sentence, but the judges who voted the philosopher guilty said that they would not have considered the death penalty for him.\nIn \"The Shadows of Socrates: The Heresy, War, and Treachery behind the Trial of Socrates\" (2024), Matt Gatton offered a new perspective on the trial, based on his reconstruction archeological work that was published in the \"Oxford Handbook of Light in Archeology\" (2022). Gatton asserts that the impiety charge against Socrates stemmed from his searing critique of Athens\u2019 most hallowed religious ritual\u2014the Mysteries of Eleusis. He writes: \"Trying to explain what happened to Socrates without talking about the Mysteries of Eleusis is like trying to explain what happened to Galileo without mentioning the Catholic Church.\" Gatton agrees with prior authors that the corrupting the youth charge was the result of the ruinous actions of several of Socrates\u2019 former students, most pointedly Alcibiades and Critias, but Gatton sees Alcibiades\u2019 alleged profanation of the Mysteries of Eleusis as a significant factor. In this respect, both of the charges against Socrates are tied back to the same source.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In typical \"Tetris\" gameplay, falling tetromino shapes must be neatly sorted into a pile. Once a horizontal line of the game board is filled in, it disappears, granting points and preventing the pile from overflowing. Since its initial creation, this gameplay has been used in over 220 versions, released for over 70 platforms. Newer versions frequently implement additional game mechanics, some of which have become standard over time. As of December 2024[ [update]], these versions collectively serve as the second-best-selling video game series with over 520 million sales, mostly on mobile devices.\nIn the mid-1980s, Pajitnov worked for the Dorodnitsyn Computing Center of the Academy of Sciences, where he programmed \"Tetris\" on the Elektronika 60 and adapted it to the IBM PC with the help of Dmitry Pavlovsky and Vadim Gerasimov. Floppy disk copies were distributed freely throughout Moscow before spreading to Eastern Europe. Robert Stein of Andromeda Software saw the game in Hungary and contacted the Dorodnitsyn Computing Center to secure a license to release the game commercially. Stein then sub licensed to Mirrorsoft in the UK and Spectrum HoloByte in the US. Both companies released the game in 1988 to commercial success and sub licensed to additional companies, including Henk Rogers' Bullet-Proof Software. Rogers negotiated with Elektronorgtechnica, the state-owned organization in charge of licensing Soviet software, to license \"Tetris\" to Nintendo for the Game Boy and Nintendo Entertainment System (NES); both versions were released in 1989. \nWith 35 million sales as of June 2024, the Game Boy version is the best-selling version of \"Tetris\" and among the best-selling video games of all time. Its commercial success upon release contributed to the Game Boy's success and popularized \"Tetris\". At the end of 1995, Dorodnitsyn Computing Center's rights to \"Tetris\", arranged ten years prior, reverted to Pajitnov. He and Rogers subsequently formed the Tetris Company to manage licensing. Guidelines for authorized releases were established, with certain features not in the original games becoming standardized over time. Versions of \"Tetris\" were released on mobile devices starting in the 2000s, with Electronic Arts (EA) holding a license on such ports from 2006 to 2020, to widespread commercial success. \"Tetris\" received renewed popularity in the late-2010s with the release of the critically successful \"Tetris Effect\" (2018) and \"Tetris 99\" (2019).\n\"Tetris\" is frequently cited as one of the greatest and most influential games ever made, and was among the inaugural class inducted into the World Video Game Hall of Fame in 2015. Its gameplay has been influential in the genre of puzzle video games, being cited as an early example of casual gaming. Furthermore, \"Tetris\" has been represented in a vast array of media such as architecture and art and been the subject of academic research, including studies of its potential for psychological intervention. A competitive culture has formed around \"Tetris\", particularly the NES version, with players\u00a0\u2013 typically adolescents\u00a0\u2013 competing at the annual Classic Tetris World Championship. A film dramatization of its development was released in 2023.\nGameplay.\nAcross its numerous versions, \"Tetris\" generally has a consistent puzzle video game design. Gameplay consists of a rectangular field in which tetromino pieces, geometric shapes consisting of four connected squares, descend from the top-center. During the descent, the player can move the piece horizontally and rotate them until they touch the bottom of the field or another piece. The player's goal is to stack the pieces in the field to create horizontal lines of blocks. When a line is completed, it disappears and the blocks placed above fall one row. The speed of the descending pieces increases as lines are cleared. The game ends if the accumulated pieces in the field block other pieces from entering the field, a process known as \"topping out\". Common mechanics among \"Tetris\" versions include the queue (viewing the pieces that are next to appear), soft drop (increasing the descent of the piece), hard drop (instantly placing the piece as far down as it can go), and holding (reserving a piece for later use).\nThe objective of \"Tetris\" is to collect as many points as possible during a gameplay session by clearing lines. \"Tetris\"'s scoring system has remained mostly consistent since \"Tetris DS\" (2006) with some exceptions. Points gained during gameplay increase with the descent speed. The more lines cleared at once, the higher the score for a line clear. Clearing four lines at once using an I-shaped tetromino is referred to as a \"Tetris\". Furthermore, the player can also gain points by using hard drops or soft drops. Advanced techniques, often used in competitive play, include T-spins (spinning a T-shaped tetromino into a blocked gap), perfect clears (emptying the field following a line clear), and combos (clearing lines consecutively).\nHistory.\nCreation (1984\u20131985).\nAlexey Pajitnov was a speech recognition and artificial intelligence researcher for the Dorodnitsyn Computing Center of the Academy of Sciences. Pajitnov developed several puzzle games on the institute's Elektronika 60, an archaic Russian clone of the PDP-11 computer. In June 1984, he became inspired to convert pentomino tiling puzzles to the computer after he bought a pentomino puzzle set from a store and played with it in his office.\nPajitnov programmed \"Tetris\" using Pascal for the RT-11 operating system on the Elektronika 60 and experimented with different versions. Because the Elektronika 60 had no graphical interface, Pajitnov modeled the field and pieces using spaces and brackets. He felt that the game would be needlessly complicated with the twelve different shapes of pentominoes, so he scaled the concept down to tetrominoes, of which there are only seven shapes. Afterward, he programmed the basic mechanics, including the ability to flip tetrominoes as they fell in a vertical screen and the clearing of lines. The name \"Tetris\" was a combination of \"tetra\" (meaning \"four\") and Pajitnov's favorite sport, tennis. Pajitnov completed the first version of \"Tetris\" c. 1985. This version had no scoring system and no levels, but it nonetheless captivated Pajitnov's peers.\nPajitnov sought to port \"Tetris\" to the IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC), which had a higher-quality display than the Elektronika 60. He recruited his colleague Dmitry Pavlovsky and the 16-year-old computer prodigy Vadim Gerasimov. Using Turbo Pascal, the three adapted \"Tetris\" to the IBM PC over two months, with Gerasimov incorporating color and Pavlovsky incorporating a scoreboard. Floppy disk copies of this version were distributed freely throughout the Dorodnitsyn Computing Center, before spreading quickly among Moscow computer circles. Pajitnov kept note of second-hand accounts of \"Tetris\"'s spread during this time. \"Tetris\" reportedly won second place in a Zelenodolsk computer game competition in November 1985, and by 1986, nearly everyone with an IBM computer in Moscow and several major cities had played \"Tetris\".\nSpread beyond the Soviet Union (1985\u20131988).\nUnder Soviet law, intellectual rights were not protected, and the state-run organization Elektronorgtechnica (Elorg) had a monopoly on the import and export of software. Around this time, Pajitnov arranged for the Dorodnitsyn Computing Center to have the rights to \"Tetris\" for ten years to ease potential legal troubles. As a result, Pajitnov could not sell \"Tetris\" for profit. Nonetheless, Pajitnov's manager Victor Brjabrin liked \"Tetris\" and sought opportunities for success beyond the Soviet Union. In early 1986, Brjabrin sent a copy of \"Tetris\" to the SZKI Institute of Computer Studies in Budapest. Robert Stein, founder of Andromeda Software who profited by licensing software from Hungary to UK companies, encountered \"Tetris\" during a visit to the SZKI Institute and found its gameplay compelling. Stein learned from the SZKI Institute director that they had managed to port \"Tetris\" to Commodore or Apple computers. He returned to London and contacted Dorodnitsyn Computing Center by telex to obtain the license rights, believing he could sell those rights to a larger UK publisher. \nBrjabrin received the telex and, after translating it from English to Russian, disclosed it to Pajitnov, who spent days attempting to compose, translate to English, and send a favorable yet noncommittal response by telex to Stein. Despite this attempt, Stein interpreted the response as granting him the license and proceeded to find a publisher for \"Tetris\". Stein pitched \"Tetris\" to Jim Mackonochie of Mirrorsoft, a UK software company founded by business magnate Robert Maxwell and Mackonochie. Though Mackonochie was skeptical about the commercial potential of \"Tetris\", he consulted Phil Adam, president of US sister company Spectrum HoloByte, for his input. During his overseas visit to Mirrorsoft, Adam played \"Tetris\" for hours and then encouraged Mackonochie to accept Stein's offer. Though still cautious, Mackonochie agreed to allow himself the licensing rights for Europe and Adam the rights for the United States and Japan. Stein sold the rights to the two companies for \u00a33,000 and royalties of 7.5\u201315% of sales, even though negotiations with the Dorodnitsyn Computing Center were at a standstill, with the Dorodnitsyn Computing Center being resistant to selling \"Tetris\" in the West.\nGilman Louie, CEO of Spectrum HoloByte, sought to exoticize the game's Soviet origins, marketing it as the first Soviet product to be sold in North America, alongside implementing Soviet folk music and imagery during gameplay and using red packaging adorned with an illustration of Saint Basil's Cathedral. \"Tetris\" was first commercially released in the West for the IBM PC, with ports to other computer systems planned for release in the following weeks. Mirrorsoft released the game in the United Kingdom on January 27, 1988, and Spectrum HoloByte released it in the United States on January 29, 1988. Mirrorsoft rewrote the code of the original IBM release for systems such as the Amiga, Atari ST, and Commodore 64. Boosted by word of mouth and positive reviews, this \"Tetris\" release was commercially successful, selling 100 thousand copies within a year. At the Software Publishers Association's Excellence in Software Awards ceremony in 1989, \"Tetris\" won across three categories.\nAt the time, the only document certifying a license fee was the telex from Pajitnov and Brjabrin, meaning that Stein had sold the license for a game he did not yet own. Additionally, Alexander Alexinko, director of Elorg, discovered Stein's negotiations with Pajitnov and Dorodnitsyn Computing Center and assessed their communications with disapproval. In response, Elorg took over representing the Soviet Union in negotiations. Through communications, Alexinko attempted to revoke any potential deal the Soviet Union might have had with Stein in favor of having Elorg itself sell \"Tetris\" internationally. Stein responded by threatening to create a scandal that would harm the Soviet Union's international standing, persuading Alexino to consider negotiating the rights to \"Tetris\". An agreement was drafted by the end of February 1988 and finalized by May, granting Stein the rights to \"Tetris\" on computers.\nInternational negotiations (1988\u20131989).\nFollowing the commercial release of \"Tetris\", Spectrum HoloByte and Mirrorsoft started licensing the game to other companies for platforms that were not covered by the contract that Stein and Elorg had agreed to. At the time, Henk Rogers had been seeking video games across the world to sell in Japan through his company Bullet-Proof Software; he discovered \"Tetris\" as a publicly displayed video game at the 1988 Winter Consumer Electronics Show (CES). Mirrorsoft sold Atari Games subsidiary Tengen the rights to sell non-computer releases of \"Tetris\" in Japan in exchange for the rights to sell computer ports of \"Blasteroids\" worldwide. Afterward, Tengen sold the Japanese arcade rights to Sega and the console rights to Rogers, who received the Japanese computer rights from Spectrum HoloByte. Bullet-Proof Software released \"Tetris\" for Japanese computers in November 1988 and Nintendo's Family Computer (Famicom) in December 1988, the latter of which became commercially successful, selling two million copies in Japan. Despite this, Elorg was unaware of the Famicom version and was receiving no royalties from \"Tetris\"'s worldwide success. \nAround the time of \"Tetris\"'s Famicom version, Nintendo developed the Game Boy, an economical handheld game console that interested Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi and Nintendo of America president Minoru Arakawa. Arakawa, aided by Nintendo of America vice president Howard Lincoln, sought to port \"Tetris\" to the Game Boy, believing that it would be a commercial success. They were both discouraged by the convoluted nature of the game's legal rights, leading Arakawa to enlist Rogers in getting the handheld rights to \"Tetris\". Rogers contacted Stein by fax in November 15, 1988, for the handheld rights, with Stein responding that he was negotiating them with Elorg. At the time, Alexinko had been replaced by the more adversarial Evgeni Belikov as director of Elorg. After failing to get the rights after multiple attempts at contacting Stein, Rogers abandoned him in favor of negotiating directly with the Soviet government. In February 1989, Rogers traveled to the Soviet Union and arrived at the Elorg offices uninvited to negotiate the rights. Discussions with Rogers were scheduled the next day.\nWhile trying to persuade Elorg to grant him the handheld rights, Rogers displayed a Famicom \"Tetris\" cartridge to demonstrate the game's success. Belikov did not recognize the cartridge, believing that the rights to \"Tetris\" had only been signed for computer systems per the contract with Stein, and accused Rogers of illegal publication. Though surprised, Rogers provided a check of over $40,000 to Elorg as to remedy this breach of contract and discussed granting him the console rights. Afterward, Belikov recognized the potential financial benefits of allying with Rogers over the other incoming negotiators: Stein and Robert's son Kevin Maxwell. While Rogers was consulting Nintendo for a potential offer to Elorg, Belikov implicitly diminished Stein and Kevin's standing in subsequent meetings by coercing the former into signing an updated contract with an exclusionary definition of computers and baiting the latter into admitting that Mirrosoft did not have the console rights, unaware of the commercial Famicom release. Rogers, alongside Arakawa and Lincoln, returned to Moscow, and after a few days of negotiation, Nintendo received both the handheld and console rights to \"Tetris\" from Elorg.\nLegal battles and aftermath (1989\u20131996).\nOn March 31, 1989, taking advantage of the new agreement, Lincoln sent a cease and desist fax to Hideyuki Nakajima, president of Atari Games, concerning their subsidiary Tengen's production of \"Tetris\" for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), the North American equivalent to the Famicom. Believing themselves to own the console rights to \"Tetris\", Tengen filed copyright applications for the game in the United States and preemptively sued Nintendo. Meanwhile, after being informed by Kevin, Robert pressured Elorg for sidestepping prior agreements with his companies by contacting ministers from both the Soviet and UK governments. In an in-person meeting, Robert informed Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev of his situation regarding \"Tetris\", to which he responded that Robert \"should no longer worry about the Japanese company\". Despite pressure from both Robert and the Soviet government, Belikov stated his refusal to concede in a conversation with Lincoln.\nAfter a marketing campaign ordered by Nakajima, Tengen released their version of \"Tetris\" on the NES on May 17, 1989, selling tens of thousands of copies within a few weeks. The next month, Judge Fern M. Smith of the US District Court for the Northern District of California presided over competing lawsuits from Atari Games and Nintendo over their console rights to \"Tetris\". Both companies motioned for preliminary injunctions that would prohibit the other company from selling \"Tetris\". On June 15, 1989, in defense of its motion for injunction, Atari Games argued that the NES fell under the definition of computers under the original contract and that Elorg only excluded consoles from its definition of computers to take advantage of higher profits from Nintendo. Based on contradicting evidence, Smith rejected this argument and declared that Mirrorsoft and Spectrum HoloByte had never received explicit authorization for marketing on consoles, granting a preliminary injunction against Atari Games on June 22. \nThe next day, Atari Games withdrew its NES version from sale, and thousands of cartridges remained unsold in its warehouses. Preference for this release over Nintendo's led to Atari Games cartridges selling for up to $300 on the secondary market. The Game Boy version of \"Tetris\" was released in Japan on June 14, 1989, and as a pack-in game in the United States on July 31, 1989. Nintendo's NES version was released the same year. Both releases achieved commercial success. The Game Boy version was the primary game promoted for the Game Boy, becoming its killer app, generating $80 million in revenue, and popularizing both the Game Boy and the \"Tetris\" game. The NES version quickly sold three million copies and appeared on Nintendo's most popular games list for over a year. \nOn November 13, 1989, Smith ended the legal battle between Nintendo and Atari Games regarding \"Tetris\" by summary judgment, granting Nintendo the console rights to \"Tetris\". In 1991, with Rogers' help, Pajitnov and his family emigrated to Seattle, where he worked as a freelance game designer. During this time, Pajitnov worked on several sequels to \"Tetris\". \"Welltris\" (1990) involved adjusting geometrical pieces descending down one of four walls of a three-dimensional well, and \"Hatris\" (1990) and \"Faces...tris III\" (1991) replaced descending tetrominoes with hats and faces respectively. Though they generally received positive reviews and commercial success, with \"Faces...Tris III\" winning \"Best Action/Arcade Program\" in the 1991 Excellence in Software Awards, none replicated \"Tetris\"' success. Other early versions and sequels of \"Tetris\" were developed without Pajitnov's involvement, including Spectrum Holobyte's \"Super Tetris\" (1991), Bullet-Proof Software's \"Tetris 2 + BomBliss\" (1991) and \"Tetris Battle Gaiden\" (1993), and Nintendo's \"Tetris 2\" (1993).\nThe Tetris Company and Blue Planet Software (1996\u20132014).\nThe Dorodnitsyn Computing Center's rights to \"Tetris\" expired at the end of 1995, reverting back to Pajitnov. Worried that Elorg, which had become a private company under Belikov following the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, would try to claim the rights, Pajitnov recruited Rogers to secure them. Rogers formed The Tetris Company as an equal partnership between Elorg and Rogers' new company, Blue Planet Software. Rogers acquired Elorg and renamed it Tetris Holding in 2005. Since its formation, the Tetris Company has maintained guidelines for authorized versions of \"Tetris\", and Blue Planet Software has served as an agent for the \"Tetris\" brand. The Tetris Company has also enforced its copyright of the \"Tetris\" game against unauthorized clones, such as in the 2012 case \"Tetris Holding, LLC v. Xio Interactive, Inc.\", where a judge ruled that the iOS game \"Mino\" violated \"Tetris\"'s copyright based on look and feel.\nPajitnov and Rogers sought to keep \"Tetris\" versions fresh, and innovated in new directions. \"Tetrisphere\", developed by H2O Entertainment and released on August 11, 1997, was an example of this innovation. Gameplay involved rotating a three-dimensional sphere to place pieces on its surface. It was the first puzzle video game on the Nintendo 64 and garnered a cult following. David Crookes of \"Retro Gamer\" called \"Tetrisphere\" \"proof that the concept could be modernised and tweaked, while still being faithful to the original\". Another version on the Nintendo 64, the Japan-exclusive \"Tetris 64\" (1998), allowed for four players and was the only game to utilize the Nintendo 64's Bio Sensor, which detected a player's pulse. On other platforms around this time, \"Tetris Plus\" (1996), \"Tetris DX\" (1998), and \"The Next Tetris\" (1999) added new game modes, and \"\" (1998) was an arcade game targeted toward experienced players. \nAccording to Rogers, in order to appeal to beginner players, the Tetris Company started to incorporate features not in the original releases into the \"Tetris\" guidelines. These features included the hold feature and ability to perform both soft drops and hard drops in \"The New Tetris\" in 1999, the easy spin and super rotation system in \"Tetris Worlds\" in 2001, and the scoring system introduced in \"Tetris DS\" in 2006. Critics panned \"Tetris Worlds\" for the easy spin mechanic, which allowed players to delay a piece's descent by continually rotating it. Despite the controversy and Pajitnov's reluctance, the mechanic was implemented into the \"Tetris\" guidelines. \"Tetris Worlds\" also introduced the super rotation system, defining how pieces are to rotate, which most \"Tetris\" games have since used.\n\"Tetris\" was first released on mobile devices in 2001 by G-Mode. In 2002, Rogers formed Blue Lava Wireless to develop \"Tetris\" games for mobile platforms. JAMDAT acquired Blue Lava Wireless in April 2005, granting the former a 15-year license of \"Tetris\" for mobile platforms. By December 2005, when Electronic Arts (EA) started its acquisition of JAMDAT, \"Tetris\" had been consistently selling well on American carrier phones. EA completed its acquisition in February 2006, granting it the mobile license for \"Tetris\". EA Mobile released their mobile version of \"Tetris\" as a launch game for the iTunes store on iPod 5G on September 11, 2006, and on the Apple App Store on iOS on July 10, 2008. By January 2010, EA's mobile releases reached 100 million paid downloads, making \"Tetris\" the most popular mobile game at the time.\nMaya Rogers' succession and resurgence of popularity (2014\u2013present).\nIn January 2014, after eight years of involvement, Henk Rogers' daughter Maya succeeded him as the CEO of Blue Planet Software. She began by planning activities for \"Tetris\"'s 30th anniversary. In an interview with \"VentureBeat\" in June 2014, Maya spoke of her desire to expand \"Tetris\"'s brand, such as through merchandising, and keeping the game fresh. Sega released \"Puyo Puyo Tetris\", a crossover between \"Tetris\" and \"Puyo Puyo\", in Japan on February 6, 2014, for multiple platforms. \"Puyo Puyo Tetris\" sold over 60,000 copies within a week, with the Nintendo 3DS port being the second-highest-selling game of the week according to \"4Gamer.net\". Ubisoft's \"Tetris Ultimate\" was released on the Nintendo 3DS in November 2014 and the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in December 2014. \"Tetris Ultimate\" received mixed reviews, though the online multiplayer was generally seen favorably.\nIn the late 2010s, the \"Tetris\" series had a resurgence in popularity with the release of \"Tetris Effect\" and \"Tetris 99\". \"PCMag\" credited the resurgence to the 2017 release of \"Puyo Puyo Tetris\" in the Western world, where it received positive reviews and sold 1.4 million copies worldwide by November 2020. \"Tetris Effect\", developed by Monstars and Resonair and published by Enhance Games, was released on the PlayStation 4 on November 9, 2018, and on Windows on July 23, 2019, receiving widespread critical acclaim for its visuals and emotional impact. \"Tetris 99\" is a battle royale version of \"Tetris\" made available to subscribers of Nintendo Switch Online on February 13, 2019, upon its surprise announcement during Nintendo Direct. It received positive reviews and became Nintendo Switch Online's killer app; according to President of Nintendo Shuntaro Furukawa, 2.8 million Nintendo Switch Online users played \"Tetris 99\" within a few months of release.\nEA announced in January 2020 that its license for mobile releases of \"Tetris\" would expire on April 21, 2020, with the game becoming inoperable as a result. Video game developer N3twork subsequently released authorized mobile releases on the iOS and Android on January 23, 2020. These accumulated 30 million downloads before social casino company PlayStudios acquired the rights to them in November 2021. On March 28, 2023, Playstudios incorporated a playAwards loyalty program onto the \"Tetris\" mobile apps, allowing players to win points for playing \"Tetris\" that can be redeemed for real-life awards. \"Tetris Forever\", a compilation of \"Tetris\" games and interactive documentary developed by Digital Eclipse, was released on November 12, 2024, to positive reviews for chronicling the history of \"Tetris\".\nVersions.\n\"Tetris\" has been released on a multitude of platforms since its initial creation. It is available on many game consoles, personal computers, smartphones, among other platforms. To date, \"Guinness World Records\" recognizes \"Tetris\" as the video game with the most ports, totaling over 220 versions across over 70 platforms. Across its multiple versions, \"Tetris\"'s core gameplay has remained consistent. Since 1996, the Tetris Company has maintained annual standard specifications for authorized versions of \"Tetris\". Pajitnov considers these guidelines a baseline for different versions and not \"set in stone\". Several game mechanics of \"Tetris\" have been changed over time. For example, the distribution of tetrominoes was completely randomized in early versions, while modern versions use a \"bag system\", in which each tetromino is guaranteed to appear once in a set of seven. Other mechanics that have become standardized in modern versions include the ability to hold tetrominoes to swap with later pieces, introduced in \"The New Tetris\" (1999), and the super rotation system and infinite spin, introduced in \"Tetris Worlds\" (2001).\nThe original Elektronica 60 version of \"Tetris\" had no music. Spectrum Holobyte's version of \"Tetris\" in the United States exoticized the Soviet origins through elements such as Russian music, including Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's \"Trepak\" from \"The Nutcracker\" and Reinhold Gli\u00e8re's \"Russian Sailor Dance\" from \"The Red Poppy\". This approach differed from other versions of \"Tetris\" from other countries at the time: Mirrorsoft's Commodore 64 versions in Europe used an atmospheric soundtrack, and Sega's arcade version in Japan used a synthesized pop-influenced soundtrack. Nintendo's versions for NES and Game Boy continued the pattern of using Russian music. The NES version uses Tchaikovsky's \"Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy\" from \"The Nutcracker\" as Music A, with the Russian-influenced Music B and the mellow Music C having unclear origins. The Game Boy version has the 1860s Russian folk tune \"Korobeiniki\" for Music A, an original composition by Hirokazu Tanaka for Music B, and the Menuet of Johann Sebastian Bach's \"French Suite no. 3\" for Music C. \"Korobeiniki\" has become primarily associated with \"Tetris\" as its main theme and would be used in most significant versions within the series, as mandated by the Tetris Company guidelines.\nReception.\nSales.\nIn January 2010, EA Mobile and Blue Planet Software announced that the mobile versions of \"Tetris\" released 2005 had reached 100 million paid downloads, making it most-downloaded mobile game at the time. In April 2014, Rogers announced in an interview with \"VentureBeat\" that \"Tetris\" totaled 425 million paid mobile downloads and 70 million physical copies. To date, all versions of \"Tetris\" collectively serve as the second-best-selling video game series of all time, totaling 520 million sales according to The Tetris Company. The majority originate from paid mobile downloads, based on Rogers' figure from the 2014 interview. Some publications consider \"Tetris\" the best-selling video game of all time due to these figures, though BBC disputes this claim due to differences between the versions, including on mobile platforms. The most commercially successful version is the Game Boy version, which at 35 million copies is among the best-selling video games of all time. By 1996, the original had sold nearly 40 million copies. \nAccolades.\n\"Tetris\" has garnered accolades and awards since its initial commercial release. The Spectrum HoloByte version won three Software Publishers Association Excellence in Software awards in 1989, including Best Entertainment Program and the Critic's Choice Award for consumers. \"Macworld\" inducted \"Tetris\" into the 1988 \"Macworld\" Game Hall of Fame in the Best Strategy Game category. \"Macworld\" praised \"the addictive quality\" and said its \"simplicity is bewitching\", and \"Compute!\" gave \"Tetris\" the 1989 Choice Award for Arcade Game, describing it as \"by far, the most addictive game ever\". \"Entertainment Weekly\" named the NES version the eighth-greatest game available for sale in 1991, saying: \"Thanks to Nintendo's endless promotion, \"Tetris\" has become one of the most popular video games.\"\n\"Tetris\" is widely considered among the greatest video games of all time, being ranked as such by \"Flux\" (1995), \"Next Generation\" (1996 and 1999), \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" (1997), \"GameSpot\" (2000), \"Game Informer\" (2001 and 2009), \"IGN\" (2007 and 2021), \"Time\" (2012 and 2016), \"GamesRadar+\" (2015 and 2021), \"Polygon\" (2017), \"USA Today\" (2022 and 2024), \"The Times\" (2023), and \"GQ\" (2023). \"Tetris\" has also been ranked as among the best computer games by \"PC Format\" (1991) and \"Computer Gaming World\" (1996), among the best video game franchises by \"IGN\" (2006) and \"Den of Geek\" (2024), and among the most influential games of all time by \"GamePro\" (2007), \"IGN\" (2007), \"1Up.com\" (2010), \"GamesRadar+\" (2013), and \"The Guardian\" (2017).\n\"Tetris\" has been inducted into the \"Hall of Fame\" of the following publications: \"Computer Gaming World\" (1999), \"GameSpy\" (2000), \"GameSpot\" (2003), and \"IGN\" (2007). At the 2007 Game Developers Choice Awards, Pajitnov won the First Penguin Award, known afterward as the Pioneer Award, for pioneering casual gaming through \"Tetris\". \"Tetris\" was listed as part of the game canon, announced at the 2007 Game Developers Conference by Henry Lowood of Stanford University as a list of ten games to be considered for preservation by the Library of Congress, modeled after the National Film Preservation Board. In November 2012, the Museum of Modern Art acquired \"Tetris\", along with thirteen other video games, to display. As part of the 2015 inaugural class, The Strong National Museum of Play inducted \"Tetris\" into the World Video Game Hall of Fame for its iconic nature.\nLegacy.\nIndustry impact.\nDue to Rogers and Nintendo's belief in its potential for mass appeal, \"Tetris\" was the pack-in game and the primary game promoted for the Game Boy in the United States. The resulting public anticipation led \"Tetris\" to become the Game Boy's main draw, with many, including non-gamers, buying the Game Boy specifically to play \"Tetris\". This release simultaneously contributed to both the popularity of the \"Tetris\" game and the Game Boy, with the bundle selling out its initial run of a million copies shortly after release. This success established Nintendo's dominant position in the handheld gaming market, setting a standard that competitors struggled to replicate. Several writers credit \"Tetris\" and \"Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue\" (1996) for the Game Boy's longevity, as it would not be discontinued until 2003.\n\"Tetris\" is influential in the genre of puzzle video games. Commentators have considered \"Tetris\" an early example of a casual game. \"Wired\" deemed \"Tetris\" unique for its time, given its appeal to players regardless of gender and age, and \"1Up.com\" credits \"Tetris\" for establishing a market for puzzle video games with universal appeal. Various common elements of puzzle games, such as managing pieces over a fixed screen, originated from \"Tetris\", and multiple clones have been created to replicate \"Tetris\"'s popularity. Video games influenced by \"Tetris\" include Nintendo's \"Dr. Mario\" (1990), Sega's \"Columns\" (1990), Compile's \"Puyo Puyo\" (1991), Taito's \"Puzzle Bobble\" (1994), and Capcom's \"Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo\" (1996).\nCultural impact.\n\"Tetris\"'s cultural impact and recognition is widespread, being represented in a vast array of video game platforms, among other media such as architecture, art, and merchandise. \"Tetris\" has been frequently referenced in pop culture, such as in \"The Simpsons\", \"The Big Bang Theory\", \"Family Guy\", \"Futurama\", \"Office Space\", \"Muppet Babies\", and Monty Python. The game has also earned multiple Guinness records, such as the record for \"largest architectural video game display\", granted to a game of \"Tetris\" hosted on the side of the 29-story Cira Center in April 2014. \"Korobeiniki\", a Russian folk song, has become widely associated with \"Tetris\" following its inclusion in the Game Boy version. A 1992 Eurodance cover of \"Korobeiniki\" by Doctor Spin peaked at number six on the UK singles charts. The \"\"Tetris\" effect\" refers to the phenomena of perceiving certain patterns in dreams and mental images following engagement in a repetitive activity such as playing \"Tetris.\" The term was coined by Jeffrey Goldsmith in a 1994 article for \"Wired\",&lt;ref name=\"wired/1994/05/tetris\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in which he compared \"Tetris\" to an \"electronic drug\".\nThe background of \"Tetris\", including its creation and legal battles in the late 1980s, has been documented multiple times. David Sheff provided a comprehensive overview in his influential Nintendo history book \"Game Over\" (1994). Subsequent books that covered this topic include the non-fiction books Steven L. Kent's \"The Ultimate History of Video Games\" (2001), Tristan Donovan's ' (2010), Dan Ackerman's \"The Tetris Effect\" (2016), and the graphic novel Box Brown's ' (2016). \"Tetris\" has also been the subject of documentaries including BBC's \"Tetris: From Russia with Love\" (2004) and the independent \"\" (2010). \"Tetris\", a film dramatization of the legal battles starring Taron Egerton as Rogers, premiered on Apple TV+ on March 31, 2023, to positive reviews, according to Metacritic, and a viewership of 88,000 people, according to Samba TV. Henk Rogers' memoir, \"The Perfect Game\u2014Tetris: From Russia With Love\", was published on April 1, 2025, to provide his perspective on \"Tetris\"'s history following the film's release.\n\"Tetris\" is part of the competitive gaming scene, especially around the NES version. Competitor Jonas Neubauer and his victory in the inaugural Classic Tetris World Championship (CTWC) in 2010 were the subjects of \"Ecstasy of Order: The Tetris Masters\", which helped popularized competitive gameplay of \"Tetris\". Competitors at the CTWC, typically adolescents, have used the CTWC to demonstrate advancements in the gameplay of the NES version. For example, gameplay techniques such as \"hypertapping\" and \"rolling\" have been used to help competitors to maximize their scores beyond level 29, which was previously deemed impossible to complete due to its speed. Willis Gibson \"beat\" Tetris by playing NES \"Tetris\" until it crashed in a 40-minute livestream in January 2024, receiving significant media coverage for his achievement.\nResearch.\nThe \"Tetris\" game has frequently been featured in academic research, including in psychology, computer science, and game studies. By 2014, John K. Lindstedt and Wayne D. Gray, cognitive scientists of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, had traced 133 scholarly papers across a variety of academic fields that utilized \"Tetris\" in their research. Soviet clinical psychologist Vladimir Pokhilko was the first to use \"Tetris\" in clinical experiments, conducting them c. 1985 at the Moscow Medical Center. Prior to studying them, Pokhilko observed that distributed copies of \"Tetris\" to his colleagues impaired medical research due to their constant gameplay. Although he initially destroyed these copies, after new copies were reintroduced to his facility, Pokhilko used \"Tetris\" in psychological tests of his patients.\nIn psychology, starting with the research of American psychologist Richard J. Haier in 1992, \"Tetris\" has been frequently used in neuroimaging studies testing how gameplay affects the human brain. For example, the near-transfer effects of \"Tetris\" on mental rotation is frequently researched, though research methods have varied widely and results have been contradictory. Furthermore, \"Tetris\" has been studied as a potential form of psychological intervention, particularly regarding post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). To date, playing \"Tetris\" as a valid form of imagery treatment for symptoms of PTSD is in an experimental stage and in need of further research. Nonetheless, several systematic reviews and meta-analyses of studies have demonstrated some evidence supporting its effectiveness in reducing intrusive memories, especially when combined with other interventions.\nIn computer science, the \"Tetris\" game has been the subject of research papers analyzing how the tetrominoes affect gameplay. Most analyze a traditional game of \"Tetris\" and do not account for features such as lookahead. In 1992, John Brzustowski argued in his master's thesis for the University of Waterloo that it is impossible to play a traditional game of \"Tetris\" indefinitely, a conclusion affirmed by Heidi Burgiel of the University of Minnesota in 1997, who attributed the inevitable end to the game's Z-shaped tetrominoes and calculated a hard cap of seventy thousand tetrominoes. Partly accounting for the lookahead feature, in 2003 a trio of MIT students proved that the optimal strategy for playing a game of \"Tetris\" is NP-complete, meaning it is difficult to be solved by an algorithm within a reasonable time due to the game's complexity. This is true even if the player knew the complete sequence of incoming pieces.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "30340", "revid": "48998989", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30340", "title": "Pre-Socratic philosophy", "text": "Greek philosophers active before and during the time of Socrates\nPre-Socratic philosophy, also known as early Greek philosophy, is ancient Greek philosophy before Socrates. Pre-Socratic philosophers were mostly interested in cosmology, the beginning and the substance of the universe, but the inquiries of these early philosophers spanned the workings of the natural world as well as human society, ethics, and religion. They sought explanations based on natural law rather than the actions of gods. Their work and writing has been almost entirely lost. Knowledge of their views comes from \"testimonia\", i.e. later authors' discussions of the work of pre-Socratics. Philosophy found fertile ground in the ancient Greek world because of the close ties with neighboring civilizations and the rise of autonomous civil entities, \"poleis\".\nPre-Socratic philosophy began in the 6th century BC with the three Milesians: Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximenes. They all attributed the \"arche\" (a word that could take the meaning of \"origin\", \"substance\" or \"principle\") of the world to, respectively, water, \"apeiron\" (the unlimited), and air. Another three pre-Socratic philosophers came from nearby Ionian towns: Xenophanes, Heraclitus, and Pythagoras. Xenophanes is known for his critique of the anthropomorphism of gods. Heraclitus, who was notoriously difficult to understand, is known for his maxim on impermanence, \"ta panta rhei,\" and for attributing fire to be the arche of the world. Pythagoras created a cult-like following that advocated that the universe was made up of numbers. The Eleatic school (Parmenides, Zeno of Elea, and Melissus) followed in the 5th century BC. Parmenides claimed that only one thing exists and nothing can change. Zeno and Melissus mainly defended Parmenides' opinion. Anaxagoras and Empedocles offered a pluralistic account of how the universe was created. Leucippus and Democritus are known for their atomism, and their views that only void and matter exist. The Sophists advanced philosophical relativism. The Pre-Socratics have had significant impact on several concepts of Western philosophy, such as naturalism and rationalism, and paved the way for scientific methodology.\nTerminology.\n\"Pre-Socratic\" is a term adopted in the 19th century to refer to this group of philosophers. It was first used by the German philosopher J.A. Eberhard as \"vorsokratische Philosophie\" in the late 18th century. In earlier literature they were referred to as \"physikoi\" (\"physicists\", after \"physis\", \"nature\"), and their activity, as \"physiologoi\" (physical or natural philosophers), with this usage arising with Aristotle to differentiate them from \"theologoi\" (theologians) and \"mythologoi\" (storytellers and bards who conveyed Greek mythology), who attributed natural phenomena to the gods.\nThe term was coined to highlight a fundamental change in philosophical inquiries between the philosophers who lived before Socrates \u2014 who were interested in the structure of nature and \"cosmos\" (the universe), with the implication that the universe had order to it) \u2014 and Socrates and his successors, who were mostly interested in ethics and politics. The term comes with drawbacks, as several of the pre-Socratics were highly interested in ethics and how to live the best life. Further, the term implies that the pre-Socratics are less significant than Socrates, or even that they were merely a stage (implying teleology) to classical era philosophy. The term is also chronologically inaccurate, as the last of the pre-Socratics were contemporaries of Socrates.\nAccording to James Warren, the distinction between the pre-Socratic philosophers and the philosophers of the classical era is demarcated not so much by Socrates, but by geography and what texts survived. The shift from the pre-Socratic to the classical periods involves a shift from philosophers being dispersed throughout the Greek-speaking world to their being concentrated in Athens. Further, starting in the classical period we have complete surviving texts, whereas in the pre-Socratic era we have only fragments. Scholar Andr\u00e9 Laks distinguishes two traditions of separating pre-Socratics from Socratics, dating back to the classical era and running through current times. The first tradition is the Socratic-Ciceronian, which uses the content of their philosophical inquires to divide the two groups: the pre-Socratics were interested in nature whereas Socrates focused on human affairs. The other tradition, the Platonic-Aristotelian, emphasizes method as the distinction between the two groups, as Socrates moved to a more epistemological approach of studying various concepts. Because of the drawbacks of the term pre-Socratic, \"early Greek philosophy\" is also used, most commonly in English language philosophical literature.\nAndr\u00e9 Laks and Glenn W. Most have especially popularized this shift in describing the era as \"early Greek philosophy\" over \"pre-Socratic philosophy\" through their comprehensive, nine volume Loeb editions of \"Early Greek Philosophy\". In their first volume, they distinguish their systematic approach from that of Hermann Diels, beginning with the choice of \"early Greek philosophy\" over \"pre-Socratic philosophy\" most notably because Socrates is contemporary and sometimes even prior to philosophers traditionally considered \"pre-Socratic\" (such as the Atomists).\nSources.\nVery few fragments of the works of the pre-Socratic philosophers have survived. The knowledge we have of the pre-Socratics derives from the accounts of later writers such as Plato, Aristotle, Plutarch, Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, Stobaeus, and Simplicius, and some early Christian theologians, especially Clement of Alexandria and Hippolytus of Rome. Many of the works are titled \"Peri Physeos\", or \"On Nature\", a title probably attributed later by other authors. These accounts, known as \"testimonia\" (testimonies), often come from biased writers. Consequently, it is sometimes difficult to determine the actual line of argument some pre-Socratics used in supporting their views. Adding more difficulty to their interpretation is the obscure language they used. Plato paraphrased the pre-Socratics and showed no interest in accurately representing their views. Aristotle was more accurate, but saw them under the scope of his philosophy. Theophrastus, Aristotle's successor, wrote an encyclopedic book \"Opinion of the Physicists\" that was the standard work about the pre-Socratics in ancient times. It is now lost, but Simplicius relied on it heavily in his accounts.\nIn 1903, the German professors H. Diels and W. Kranz published \"Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker\" (\"The Fragments of the pre-Socratics\"), which collected all of the known fragments. Scholars now use this book to reference the fragments using a coding scheme called Diels\u2013Kranz numbering. The first two characters of the scheme are \"DK\" for Diels and Kranz. Next is a number representing a specific philosopher. After that is a code regarding whether the fragment is a \"testimonia\", coded as \"A\", or \"B\" if is a direct quote from the philosopher. Last is a number assigned to the fragment, which may include a decimal to reflect specific lines of a fragment. For example, \"DK59B12.3\" identifies line 3 of Anaxagoras fragment 12. A similar way of referring to quotes is the system prefixed with \"LM\" by Andr\u00e9 Laks and Glenn W. Most who edited \"Early Greek Philosophy\" in 2016.\nCollectively, these fragments are called \"doxography\" (derived from the latin \"doxographus\"; derived from the Greek word for \"opinion\" \"doxa\").\nHistorical background.\nPhilosophy emerged in ancient Greece in the 6th century BC. The pre-Socratic era lasted about two centuries, during which the expanding Persian Achaemenid Empire was stretching to the west, while the Greeks were advancing in trade and sea routes, reaching Cyprus and Syria. The first pre-Socratics lived in Ionia, on the western coast of Anatolia. Persians conquered the towns of Ionia c. 540 BC and Persian tyrants then ruled them. The Greeks revolted in 499 BC, but ultimately were defeated in 494 BC. Slowly but steadily Athens became the philosophical center of Greece by the middle of the fifth century. Athens was entering its Classical Era, with philosophers such as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, but the impact of the pre-Socratics continued.\nSeveral factors contributed to the birth of pre-Socratic philosophy in Ancient Greece. Ionian towns, especially Miletus, had close trade relations with Egypt and Mesopotamia, cultures with observations about the natural world that differed from those of the Greeks. Apart from technical skills and cultural influences, of paramount significance was that the Greeks acquired the alphabet c. 800 BC.\nAnother factor was the ease and frequency of intra-Greek travel, which led to the blending and comparison of ideas. During the sixth century BC, various philosophers and other thinkers moved easily around Greece, especially visiting pan-Hellenic festivals. While long-distance communication was difficult during ancient times, persons, philosophers, and books moved through other parts of the Greek peninsula, the Aegean islands, and Magna Graecia, a coastal area in Southern Italy.\nThe democratic political system of independent \"poleis\" also contributed to the rise of philosophy. Most Greek towns were not ruled by autocrats or priests, allowing citizens to question freely a wide range of issues. Various \"poleis\" flourished and became wealthy, especially Miletus. which was a centre of trade and production during the early phases of pre-Socratic philosophy. Trade of grain, oil, wine, and other commodities among each \"polis\" and colonies meant these towns were not isolated but embedded \u2013 and economically dependent \u2013 on a complex and changeable web of trade routes.\nGreek mythology also influenced the birth of philosophy. The philosophers' ideas, were, to a certain extent, answers to questions that were subtly present in the work of Homer and Hesiod. The pre-Socratics arose from a world dominated by myths, sacred places, and local deities. The work of epic poets such as Homer, Hesiod and others reflected this environment. They are considered predecessors of the pre-Socratics since they seek to address the origin of the world and to organize traditional folklore and legends systematically. Greek popular religion contained many features of the religions of neighboring civilizations, such as the Egyptians, Mesopotamians, and Hittites. The first pre-Socratic philosophers also traveled extensively to other lands, meaning that pre-Socratic thought had roots abroad as well as domestically.\nHomer, in his two epic poems, not only personifies gods and other natural phenomena, such as the Night, but he hints at some views on the origin and the nature of the world that came under scrutiny by the pre-Socratics. In his epic poem \"Theogony\" (literally meaning the birth of gods) Hesiod (c. 700 BC) describes the origin of gods, and apart from the solid mythical structure, one can notice an attempt towards organizing beliefs using some form of rationalization; an example would be that Night gives birth to Death, Sleep and Dreams. Transmigration of life, a belief of the Orphics, a religious cult originating from Thrace, had affected the thought of the 5th century BC but the overall influence of their cosmology on philosophy is disputed. Pherecydes, a poet, magician, and contemporary of Thales, in his book describes a particular cosmogony, asserting that three gods pre-existed \u2013 a step towards rationality.\nGeneral features.\nThe most important feature of pre-Socratic philosophy was the use of reason to explain the universe. The pre-Socratic philosophers shared the intuition that there was a single explanation that could explain both the plurality and the singularity of the whole \u2013 and that explanation would not be direct actions of the gods. The pre-Socratic philosophers rejected traditional mythological explanations of the phenomena they saw around them in favor of more rational explanations, initiating analytic and critical thought. Their efforts were directed at the investigation of the ultimate basis and essential nature of the external world. Many sought the material principle (\"arche\") of things, and the method of their origin and disappearance. They emphasized the rational unity of things and rejected supernatural explanations, seeking natural principles at work in the world and human society. The pre-Socratics saw the world as a \"cosmos\", an ordered arrangement that could be understood via rational inquiry. In their effort to make sense of the cosmos they coined new terms and concepts such as rhythm, symmetry, analogy, deductionism, reductionism, mathematization of nature and others.\nAn important term that is met in the thought of several pre-Socratic philosophers is \"arche\". Depending on the context, it can take various related meanings. It could mean the beginning or origin with the undertone that there is an effect on the things to follow. Also, it might mean a principle or a cause (especially in Aristotelian tradition).\nA common feature of the pre-Socratics is the absence of empiricism and experimentation in order to prove their theories. This may have been because of a lack of instruments, or because of a tendency to view the world as a unity, undeconstructable, so it would be impossible for an external eye to observe tiny fractions of nature under experimental control.\nAccording to Jonathan Barnes, a professor of ancient philosophy, pre-Socratic philosophy exhibits three significant features: they were \"internal\", \"systematic\" and \"economical\". Internal meaning they tried to explain the world with characteristics found within this world. Systematic because they tried to universalize their findings. Economical because they tried to invoke only a few new terms. Based on these features, they reached their most significant achievement: they changed the course of human thought from myth to philosophy and science.\nThe pre-Socratics were not atheists; however, they minimized the extent of the gods' involvement in natural phenomena such as thunder or totally eliminated the gods from the natural world.\nPre-Socratic philosophy encompasses the first of the three phases of ancient Greek philosophy, which spanned around a thousand years. The pre-Socratic phase itself is divided into three phases. The first phase of pre-Socratic philosophy, mainly the Milesians, Xenophanes, and Heraclitus, consisted of rejecting traditional cosmogony and attempting to explain nature based on empirical observations and interpretations. A second phase \u2013 that of the Eleatics \u2013 resisted the idea that change or motion can happen. Based on their radical monism, they believed that only one substance exists and forms Kosmos. The Eleatics were also monists (believing that only one thing exists and everything else is just a transformation of it). In the third phase, the post-Eleatics (mainly Empedocles, Anaxagoras, and Democritus) opposed most Eleatic teaching and returned to the naturalism of the Milesians.\nThe pre-Socratics were succeeded by the second phase of ancient philosophy, where the philosophical movements of Platonism, Cynicism, Cyrenaicism, Aristotelianism, Pyrrhonism, Epicureanism, Academic skepticism, and Stoicism rose to prominence until 100 BC. In the third phase, philosophers studied their predecessors.\nPre-Socratic philosophers.\nMilesian beginning: Thales, Anaximander and Anaximenes.\nThe Milesian school was located in Miletus, Ionia, in the 6th century BC. It consisted of Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximenes, who most probably had a teacher-pupil relationship. They were mainly occupied with the origin and substance of the world; each of them attributed the Whole to a single \"arche\" (beginning or principle), starting the tradition of naturalistic monism.\nThales.\nThales (c. 624\u2013546 BC) is considered to be the father of philosophy. None of his writings have survived. He is considered the first western philosopher since he was the first to use reason, to use proof, and to generalize. He created the word \"cosmos\", the first word to describe the universe. He contributed to geometry and predicted the eclipse of 585 BC. Thales may have been of Phoenician ancestry. Miletus was a meeting point and trade centre of the then great civilizations, and Thales visited the neighbouring civilizations, Egypt, Mesopotamia, Crete, and Phoenicia. In Egypt, geometry was advanced as a means of separating agricultural fields. Thales, though, advanced geometry with his abstract deductive reasoning reaching universal generalizations. Proclus, a later Athenian philosopher, attributed the theorem now known as Thales's theorem to Thales. He is also known for being the first to claim that the base angles of isosceles triangles are equal, and that a diameter bisects the circle. Like many Greeks of the time, Thales visited Sardis, where astronomical records were kept, and used astronomical observations for practical matters (oil harvesting). Thales was widely considered a genius in ancient times and was revered as one of the Seven Sages of Greece.\nMost importantly, what marks Thales as the first philosopher is the posing of the fundamental philosophical question about the origin and the substance of the world, while providing an answer based on empirical evidence and reasoning. He attributed the origin of the world to an element instead of a divine being. Our knowledge of Thales' claim derives from Aristotle. Aristotle, while discussing opinions of previous philosophers, tells us that \"Thales, the founder of this type of philosophy, says the principle (arche) is water.\" What he meant by arche is a matter of interpretation (it might be the origin, the element, or an ontological matrix), but regardless of the various interpretations, he conceived the world as One thing instead of a collection of various items and speculated on the binding/original elements.\nAnother important aspect of Thales' philosophy is his claim that everything is full of gods. What he meant by this is again a matter of interpretation; views range from theistic to atheistic. But the most plausible explanation, suggested by Aristotle, is that Thales was advocating a theory of hylozoism: that the universe, the sum of all things that exist, is divine and alive. Another notable claim made by Thales is that earth \"rests on water\". It has been suggested that he came to this conclusion after observing fish fossils on land.\nAnaximander.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;poem&gt;That from which all things are born\nthe beginning of all things\nthe first foundation of things is the Unlimited (apeiron);\nThe source from which coming-to-be is, for things that are, and for\ntheir passing away in accordance with necessity.\nFor they give justice and pay retribution to each other for their mutual\ninjustice according to the ordered process of time.&lt;/poem&gt;\n Anaximander, DK 12 B 1\n , preserved fragment of \"On Nature\"\nAnaximander (610\u2013546 BC), also from Miletus, was 25 years younger than Thales. He was a member of the elite of Miletus, wealthy and a statesman. He showed interest in many fields, including mathematics and geography. He drew the first map of the world, was the first to conclude that the earth is spherical, and made instruments to mark time, something like a clock. In response to Thales, he postulated as the first principle an undefined, unlimited substance without qualities (\"apeiron\"), out of which the primary opposites, hot and cold, moist and dry, became differentiated. His answer was an attempt to explain observable changes by attributing them to a single source that transforms to various elements. Like Thales, he provided a naturalistic explanation for phenomena previously given supernatural explanations. He is also known for speculating on the origin of mankind. He proclaimed that the earth is not situated in another structure but lies unsupported in the middle of the universe. Further, he developed a rudimentary evolutionary explanation for biodiversity in which constant universal powers affected the lives of animals. According to Giorgio de Santillana, a philosophy professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Anaximander's conception of a universe governed by laws shaped the philosophical thinking of centuries to come and was as important as the discovery of fire or Einstein's breakthroughs in science.\nAnaximenes.\nLittle is known of Anaximenes' (585\u2013525 BC) life. He was a younger contemporary and friend of Anaximander, and the two worked together on various intellectual projects. He also wrote a book on nature in prose. Anaximenes took for his principle \"a\u0113r\" (air), conceiving it as being modified, via thickening and thinning, into the other classical elements: fire, wind, clouds, water, and earth. While his theory resembled that of Anaximander, as they both claimed a single source of the universe, Anaximenes suggested sophisticated mechanisms in which air is transformed to other elements, mainly because of changes of density. Since the classical era, he was considered the father of naturalistic explanations. Anaximenes expanded Anaximander's attempt to find a unitary cause explaining natural phenomena both living and nonliving, without, according to James Warren, having to \"reduce living things in some way to mere locations of material change\".\nXenophanes.\nXenophanes was born in Colophon, an Ionian town near Miletus. He was a well-traveled poet whose primary interests were theology and epistemology. Concerning theology, he pointed out that we did not know whether there was one god or many gods, or in such case whether there was a hierarchy among them. To critique the anthropomorphic representation of the gods by his contemporary Greeks, he pointed out that different nations depicted their gods as looking like themselves. He famously said that if oxen, horses, or lions could draw, they would draw their gods as oxen, horses, or lions. This critique was not limited to the looks of gods but also their behaviour. Greek mythology, mostly shaped by the poets Homer and Hesiod, attributed moral failures such as jealousy and adultery to the gods. Xenophanes opposed this. He thought gods must be morally superior to humans. Xenophanes, however, never claimed the gods were omnipotent, omnibenevolent, or omniscient. Xenophanes also offered naturalistic explanations for phenomena such as the sun, the rainbow and St. Elmo's fire. Traditionally these were attributed to divine intervention but according to Xenophanes they were actually effects of clouds. These explanations of Xenophanes indicate empiricism in his thought and might constitute a kind of proto-scientism. Scholars have overlooked his cosmology and naturalism since Aristotle (maybe due to Xenophanes' lack of teleology) until recently but current literature suggests otherwise. Concerning epistemology, Xenophanes questioned the validity of human knowledge. Humans usually tend to assert their beliefs are real and represent truth. While Xenophanes was a pessimist about the capability of humans to reach knowledge, he also believed in gradual progress through critical thinking. Xenophanes tried to find naturalistic explanations for meteorological and cosmological phenomena.\nAncient philosophy historian Alexander Mourelatos notes Xenophanes used a pattern of thought that is still in use by modern metaphysics. Xenophanes, by reducing meteorological phenomena to clouds, created an argument that \"X in reality is Y\", for example B32, \"What they call Iris [the rainbow] that too is in reality a cloud: one that\nappears to the eye as purple, red, and green. This is still use[d] today 'lightning is massive electrical discharge' or 'items such as tables are a cloud of micro-particles'.\" Mourelatos comments that the type of analogy that the cloud analogy is remains present in scientific language and \"...is the modern philosopher's favourite subject for illustrations of inter-theoretic identity\".\nAccording to Aristotle and Diogenes Laertius, Xenophanes was Parmenides' teacher; but is a matter of debate in current literature whether Xenophanes should also be considered an Eleatic.\nHeraclitus.\nThe hallmark of Heraclitus' philosophy is flux. In fragment DK B30, Heraclitus writes: \"This world-order [Kosmos], the same of all, no god nor man did create, but it ever was and is and will be: everliving fire, kindling in measures and being quenched in measures\". Heraclitus posited that all things in nature are in a state of perpetual flux. Like previous monist philosophers, Heraclitus claimed that the \"arche\" of the world was fire, which was subject to change \u2013 that makes him a materialist monist. From fire all things originate and all things return to it again in a process of eternal cycles. Fire becomes water and earth and vice versa. These everlasting modifications explain his view that the cosmos \"was and is and will be\". The idea of continual flux is also met in the \"river fragments\". There, Heraclitus claims we can not step into the same river twice, a position summarized with the slogan \"ta panta rhei\" (everything flows). One fragment reads: \"Into the same rivers we both step and do not step; we both are and are not\" (DK 22 B49a). Heraclitus is seemingly suggesting that not only the river is constantly changing, but we do as well, even hinting at existential questions about humankind.\nAnother key concept of Heraclitus is that opposites somehow mirror each other, a doctrine called unity of opposites. Two fragments relating to this concept state, \"As the same thing in us is living and dead, waking and sleeping, young and old. For these things having changed around are those, and those in turn having changed around are these\" (B88) and \"Cold things warm up, the hot cools off, wet becomes dry, dry becomes wet\" (B126). Heraclitus' doctrine on the unity of opposites suggests that unity of the world and its various parts is kept through the tension produced by the opposites. Furthermore, each polar substance contains its opposite, in a continual circular exchange and motion that results in the stability of the cosmos. Another of Heraclitus' famous axioms highlights this doctrine (B53): \"War is father of all and king of all; and some he manifested as gods, some as men; some he made slaves, some free\", where war means the creative tension that brings things into existence.\nA fundamental idea in Heraclitus is \"logos\", an ancient Greek word with a variety of meanings; Heraclitus might have used a different meaning of the word with each usage in his book. \"Logos\" seems like a universal law that unites the cosmos, according to a fragment: \"Listening not to me but to the logos, it is wise to agree (homologein) that all things are one\" (DK 22 B50). While \"logos\" is everywhere, very few people are familiar with it. B 19 reads: [hoi polloi] \"...do not know how to listen [to Logos] or how to speak [the truth]\". Heraclitus' thought on \"logos\" influenced the Stoics, who referred to him to support their belief that rational law governs the universe.\nPythagoreanism.\nPythagoras (582\u2013496 BC) was born on Samos, a small island near Miletus. He moved to Croton at about age 30, where he established his school and acquired political influence. Some decades later he had to flee Croton and relocate to Metapontum.\nPythagoras was famous for studying numbers and the geometrical relations of numbers. A large following of Pythagoreans adopted and extended his doctrine. They advanced his ideas, reaching the claim that everything consists of numbers, the universe is made by numbers and everything is a reflection of analogies and geometrical relations. Numbers, music and philosophy, all interlinked, could comfort the beauty-seeking human soul and hence Pythagoreans espoused the study of mathematics.\nPythagorianism perceived the world as perfect harmony, dependent on number, and aimed at inducing humankind likewise to lead a harmonious life, including ritual and dietary recommendations. Their way of life was ascetic, restraining themselves from various pleasures and food. They were vegetarians and placed enormous value on friendship. Pythagoras politically was an advocate of a form of aristocracy, a position which later Pythagoreans rejected, but generally, they were reactionary and notably repressed women. Other pre-Socratic philosophers mocked Pythagoras for his belief in reincarnation.\nNotable Pythagorians included Philolaus (470-380 BC), Alcmaeon of Croton, Archytas (428-347 BC) and Echphantus. The most notable was Alcmaeon, a medical and philosophical writer. Alcmaeon noticed that most organs in the body come in pairs and suggested that human health depends on harmony between opposites (hot/cold, dry/wet), and illness is due to an imbalance of them. He was the first to think of the brain as the center of senses and thinking. Philolaus advanced cosmology through his discovery of heliocentricism \u2013 the idea that the Sun lies in the middle of the Earth's orbit and other planets.\nPythagoreanism influenced later Christian currents as Neoplatonism, and its pedagogical methods were adapted by Plato. Furthermore, there seems to be a continuity in some aspects of Plato's philosophy. As Carl A. Huffman notes, Plato had a tendency to invoke mathematics in explaining natural phenomena, and he also believed in the immortality, even divinity of the human soul.\nThe Eleatics: Parmenides, Zeno and Melissus.\nThe Eleatic school is named after Elea, an ancient Greek town on the southern Italian Peninsula. Parmenides is considered the founder of the school. Other eminent Eleatics include Zeno of Elea and Melissus of Samos. According to Aristotle and Diogenes Laertius, Xenophanes was Parmenides' teacher, and it is debated whether Xenophanes should also be considered an Eleatic. Parmenides was born in Elea to a wealthy family around 515 BC. Parmenides of Elea was interested in many fields, such as biology and astronomy. He was the first to deduce that the earth is spherical. He was also involved in his town's political life.\nParmenides' contributions were paramount not only to ancient philosophy but to all of western metaphysics and ontology. Parmenides wrote a hard to interpret poem, named \"On Nature\" or \"On What-is\", that substantially influenced later Greek philosophy. Only 150 fragments of this poem survive. It tells a story of a young man (\"kouros\" in ancient Greek) dedicated to finding the truth carried by a goddess on a long journey to the heavens. The poem consists of three parts, the proem (i.e., preface), the \"Way of Truth\" and the \"Way of Opinion\". Very few pieces from the \"Way of Opinion\" survive. In that part, Parmenides must have been dealing with cosmology, judging from other authors' references. The \"Way of Truth\" was then, and is still today, considered of much more importance. In the \"Way of Truth\", the goddess criticizes the logic of people who do not distinguish the real from the non-existent (\"What-is\" and \"What-is-Not\"). In this poem Parmenides unfolds his philosophy: that all things are One, and therefore nothing can be changed or altered. Hence, all the things that we think to be true, even ourselves, are false representations. What-is, according to Parmenides, is a physical sphere that is unborn, unchanged, and infinite. This is a monist vision of the world, far more radical than that of Heraclitus. The goddess teaches Kouros to use his reasoning to understand whether various claims are true or false, discarding senses as fallacious. Other fundamental issues raised by Parmenides' poem are the doctrine that nothing comes from nothing and the unity of being and thinking. As quoted by DK fragment 3: \"To gar auto noein estin te kai einai\" (For to think and to be is one and the same).\nZeno and Melissus continued Parmenides' thought on cosmology. Zeno is mostly known for his paradoxes, i.e., self-contradictory statements which served as proofs that Parmenides' monism was valid, and that pluralism was invalid. The most common theme of those paradoxes involved traveling a distance, but since that distance comprises infinite points, the traveler could never accomplish it. His most famous is the Achilles paradox, which is mentioned by Aristotelis: \"The second is called the 'Achilles' and says that the slowest runner will never be caught by the fastest, because it is necessary for the pursuer first to arrive at the point from which the pursued set off, so it is necessary that the slower will always be a little ahead.\" (Aristotle Phys. 239b14\u201318 [DK 29 A26]) Melissus defended and advanced Parmenides' theory using prose, without invoking divinity or mythical figures. He tried to explain why humans think various non-existent objects exist.\nThe Eleatics' focus on Being through means of logic initiated the philosophical discipline of ontology. Other philosophers influenced by the Eleatics (such as the Sophists, Plato, and Aristotle) further advanced logic, argumentation, mathematics and especially \"elenchos\" (proof). The Sophists even placed Being under the scrutiny of elenchos. Because of the Eleatics reasoning was acquiring a formal method.\nThe Pluralists: Anaxagoras and Empedocles.\nThe Pluralist school marked a return to Milesian natural philosophy, though much more refined because of Eleatic criticism.\nAnaxagoras was born in Ionia, but was the first major philosopher to emigrate to Athens. He was soon associated with the Athenian statesman Pericles and, probably due to this association, was accused by a political opponent of Pericles for impiety as Anaxagoras held that the sun was not associated with divinity; it was merely a huge burning stone. Pericles helped Anaxagoras flee Athens and return to Ionia. Anaxagoras was also a major influence on Socrates.\nAnaxagoras is known for his \"theory of everything\". He claimed that \"in everything there is a share of everything.\" Interpretations differ as to what he meant. Anaxagoras was trying to stay true to the Eleatic principle of the everlasting (What-is) while also explaining the diversity of the natural world. Anaxagoras accepted Parmenides' doctrine that everything that exists (What-is) has existed forever, but contrary to the Eleatics, he added the ideas of \"panspermia\" and \"nous\". All objects were mixtures of various elements, such as air, water, and others. One special element was \"nous\", i.e., mind, which is present in living things and causes motion. \nAccording to Anaxagoras, \"Nous\" was one of the elements that make up the cosmos. Things that had \"nous\" were alive. According to Anaxagoras, all things are composites of some basic elements; although it is not clear what these elements are. All objects are a mixture of these building blocks and have a portion of each element, except \"nous\". \"Nous\" was also considered a building block of the cosmos, but it exists only in living objects. Anaxagoras writes: \"In everything there is a portion (\"moira\") of everything except mind (\"nous\"), but there are some things in which mind too is present.\" \"Nous\" was not just an element of things, somehow it was the cause of setting the universe into motion. Anaxagoras advanced Milesian thought on epistemology, striving to establish an explanation that could be valid for all natural phenomena. Influenced by the Eleatics, he also furthered the exploration of metatheoretical questions such as the nature of knowledge.\nEmpedocles was born in Akragas, a town in the southern Italian peninsula. According to Diogenes Laertius, Empedocles wrote two books in the form of poems: \"Peri Physeos\" (On nature) and the \"Katharmoi\" (Purifications). Some contemporary scholars argue these books might be one; all agree that interpreting Empedocles is difficult.\nOn cosmological issues, Empedocles takes from the Eleatic school the idea that the universe is unborn, has always been and always will be. He also continues Anaxagoras' thought on the four \"roots\" (i.e., classical elements), that by intermixing, they create all things around us. These roots are fire, air, earth, and water. Crucially, he adds two more components, the immaterial forces of love and strife. These two forces are opposite and by acting upon the material of the four roots unite in harmony or tear apart the four roots, with the resulting mixture being all things that exist. Empedocles uses an analogy of how this is possible: as a painter uses a few basic colors to create a painting, the same happens with the four roots. It is not quite clear if love and strife co-operate or have a greater plan, but love and strife are in a continual cycle that generates life. Other beings, apart from the four roots and love and strife, according to Empedocles' \"Purifications\" are mortals, gods, and daemons. Like Pythagoras, Empedocles believed in the soul's transmigration and was vegetarian.\nAtomists: Leucippus and Democritus.\nLeucippus and Democritus both lived in Abdera, in Thrace. They are most famous for their atomic cosmology even though their thought included many other fields of philosophy, such as ethics, mathematics, aesthetics, politics, and even embryology.\nThe atomic theory of Leucippus and Democritus was a response to the Eleatic school, who held that motion is not possible because everything is occupied with What-is. Democritus and Leucippus reverted the Eleatic axiom, claiming that since motions exist, What-is-not must also exist; hence void exists. Democritus and Leucippus were skeptics regarding the reliability of our senses, but they were confident that motion exists. Atoms, according to Democritus and Leucippus, had some characteristics of the Eleatic What-is: they were homogeneous and indivisible. These characteristics allowed answers to Zeno's paradoxes. Atoms move within the void, interact with each other, and form the plurality of the world we live in, in a purely mechanical manner.\nOne conclusion of the Atomists was determinism - the philosophical view that all events are determined completely by previously existing causes. As Leucippus said, (DK 67 B2) \"Nothing comes to be random but everything is by reason and out of necessity.\" Democritus concluded that since everything is atoms and void, several of our senses are not real but conventional. Color, for example, is not a property of atoms; hence our perception of color is a convention. As Democritus said, (DK 68 B9) \"By convention sweet, by convention bitter, by convention hot, by convention cold, by convention colour; in reality atoms and void.\" This can be interpreted in two ways. According to James Warren there is an eliminativist interpretation, such that Democritus means that color is not real, and there is a relativist interpretation, such that Democritus means that color and taste are not real but are perceived as such by our senses through sensory interaction.\nSophists.\nThe sophists were a philosophical and educational movement that flourished in ancient Greece before Socrates. They attacked traditional thinking, from gods to morality, paving the way for further advances of philosophy and other disciplines such as drama, social sciences, mathematics, and history.\nPlato disparaged the sophists, causing long-lasting harm to their reputation. Plato thought philosophy should be reserved for those who had the appropriate intellect to understand it; whereas the sophists would teach anyone who would pay tuition. The sophists taught rhetoric and how to address issues from multiple viewpoints. Since the sophists and their pupils were persuasive speakers at court or in public, they were accused of moral and epistemological relativism, which indeed some sophists appeared to advocate. Prominent sophists include Protagoras, Gorgias, Hippias, Thrasymachus, Prodicus, Callicles, Antiphon, and Critias.\nProtagoras is mostly known for two of his quotes. One is that \"[humans are..] \"the measure of all things, of things that are that they are, of things that are not that they are not\"\" which is commonly interpreted as affirming philosophical relativism, but it can also be interpreted as claiming that knowledge is only relevant to humankind, that moral rightness and other forms of knowledge are relevant to and limited to human mind and perception. The other quote is, \"Concerning the gods, I cannot ascertain whether they exist or whether they do not, or what form they have; for there are many obstacles to knowing, including the obscurity of the question and the brevity of human life.\"\nGorgias wrote a book named \"On Nature,\" in which he attacked the Eleatics' concepts of What-is and What-is-not. He claimed it is absurd to hold that nonexistence exists, and that What-is was impossible since it had to either be generated or be unlimited and neither is sufficient. There is an ongoing debate among modern scholars whether he was a serious thinker, a precursor of extreme relativism and skepticism, or merely a charlatan.\nAntiphon placed natural law against the law of the city. One need not obey the city's laws as long as one will not get caught. One could argue that Antiphon was a careful hedonist\u2014rejecting dangerous pleasures.\nPhilolaous of Croton and Diogenes of Apollonia.\nPhilolaus of Croton and Diogenes of Apollonia from Thrace (born c. 460 BC) are considered the last generation of pre-Socratics. Rather than advancing a cosmological perspective on how our universe is constructed, they are mostly noted for advancing abstract thinking and argumentation.\nPythagorianism, Anaxagoras and Empedocles influenced Philolaus. He attempted to explain both the variety and unity of the cosmos. He addressed the need to explain how the various masses of the universe interact among them and coined the term \"Harmonia\", a binding force that allows mass to take shape. The structure of the cosmos consisted of \"apeira\" (unlimiteds) and \"perainonta\" (limiters).\nDiogenes of Apollonia returned to Milesian monism, but with a rather more elegant thought. As he says in DK64 B2 \"It seems to me, overall, that all things are alterations of the same things and are the same thing\". He explains that things, even when changing shapes, remain ontologically the same.\nTopics.\nKnowledge.\nThe \"mythologoi\", Homer and Hesiod, along with other poets, centuries before the pre-Socratics, thought that true knowledge was exclusive to the divine. But starting with Xenophanes, the pre-Socratics moved towards a more natural approach to knowledge. The pre-Socratics sought a method to understand the cosmos, while being aware that there is a limit to human knowledge.\nWhile Pythagoras and Empedocles linked their self-proclaimed wisdom to their divinely inspired status, they tried to teach or urge mortals to seek the truth about the natural realm\u2014Pythagoras by means of mathematics and geometry and Empedocles by exposure to experiences. Xenophanes thought that human knowledge was merely an opinion that cannot be validated or proven to be true. According to Jonathan Warren, Xenophanes set the outline of the nature of knowledge. Later, Heraclitus and Parmenides stressed the capability of humans to understand how things stand in nature through direct observation, inquiry, and reflection.\nTheology.\nPre-Socratic thought contributed to the demythologization of the Greek popular religion. The narrative of their thought contributed to shifting the course of ancient Greek philosophy and religion away from the realm of divinity and even paved the way for teleological explanations. They attacked the traditional representations of gods that Homer and Hesiod had established and put Greek popular religion under scrutiny, initiating the schism between natural philosophy and theology. Pre-Socratic philosophers did not have atheistic beliefs, but it should be kept in mind that being an atheist those days was not without social or legal dangers. Despite that, arguments rejecting deities were not barred from the public sphere which can be seen in Protagoras's quotation on the gods: \"About the gods I am able to know neither that they exist nor that they do not exist.\"\nThe theological thought starts with the Milesian philosophers. It is evident in Anaximander's idea of the \"apeiron\" steering everything, which had other abilities usually attributed to Zeus. Later, Xenophanes developed a critique of the anthropomorphism of the gods. Xenophanes set three preconditions for God: he had to be all good, immortal and not resembling humans in appearance, which had a major impact on western religious thought.\nThe theological thought of Heraclitus and Parmenides is not entirely certain, but it is generally accepted that they believed in some kind of divinity. The Pythagoreans and Empedocles believed in the transmigration of souls. Anaxagoras asserted that cosmic intelligence (\"nous\") gives life to things. Diogenes of Appollonia expanded this line of thinking and might have constructed the first teleological argument \"it would not be possible without Intellection for it so to be divided up that it has the measures of all things \u2014 of winter and summer and night and day and rains and winds and fair weather. The other things, too, if one wishes to consider them, one would find disposed of in the best possible way.\" While some pre-Socratics were trying to find alternatives to divinity, others were setting the foundation of explaining the universe in terms of teleology and intelligent design by a divine force.\nMedicine.\nPrior to the pre-Socratics, health and illness were thought to be governed by gods. Pre-Socratic philosophy and medicine advanced in parallel, with medicine as a part of philosophy and vice versa. It was Hippocrates (often hailed as the father of medicine) who separated \u2013 but not completely \u2013 the two domains. Physicians incorporated pre-Socratic philosophical ideas about the nature of the world in their theoretical framework, blurring the border between the two domains. An example is the study of epilepsy, which in popular religion was thought to be a divine intervention to human life, but Hippocrates' school attributed it to nature, just as Milesian rationalism demythologized other natural phenomena such as earthquakes. The systematic study of anatomy, physiology, and illnesses led to the discovery of cause-effect relations and a more sophisticated terminology and understanding of the diseases that ultimately yielded rational science.\nCosmology.\nThe pre-Socratics were the first to attempt to provide reductive explanations for a plethora of natural phenomena.\nFirstly, they were preoccupied with the mystery of the cosmic matter\u2014what was the basic substance of the universe? Anaximander suggested \"apeiron\" (limitless), which hints, as Aristotle analyzed, there is no beginning and no end to it, both chronologically and within the space. Anaximenes placed \"a\u00ear\" (air) as the primary principle, probably after realizing the importance of air to life and/or the need to explain various observable changes. Heraclitus, also seeking to address the issue of the ever changing world, placed fire as the primary principle of the universe, that transforms to water and earth to produce the universe. Ever-transforming nature is summarized by Heraclitus' axiom \"panta rhei\" (everything is in a state of flux). Parmenides suggested two ever-lasting primary building blocs, night and day, which together form the universe. Empedocles increased the building blocks to four and named them roots, while also adding Love and Strife, to serve as the driving force for the roots to mingle. Anaxagoras extended even more the plurality of Empedocles, claiming everything is in everything, myriads of substances were mixing among each other except one, \"Nous\" (mind) that orchestrates everything\u2014but did not attribute divine characteristics to \"Nous\". Leucippus and Democritus asserted the universe consists of atoms and void, while the motion of atoms is responsible for the changes we observe.\nRationalism, observation and the beginning of scientific thought.\nThe pre-Socratic intellectual revolution is widely considered to have been the first step towards liberation of the human mind from the mythical world and initiated a march towards reason and scientific thought that yielded modern western philosophy and science. The pre-Socratics sought to understand the various aspects of nature by means of rationalism, observations, and offering explanations that could be deemed as scientific, giving birth to what became Western rationalism. Thales was the first to seek for a unitary arche of the world. Whether arche meant the beginning, the origin, the main principle or the basic element is unclear, but was the first attempt to reduce the explanations of the universe to a single cause, based on reason and not guided by any sort of divinity. Anaximander offered the principle of sufficient reason, a revolutionary argument that would also yield the principle that nothing comes out of nothing. Most of pre-Socratics seemed indifferent to the concept of teleology, especially the Atomists who fiercely rejected the idea. According to them, the various phenomena were the consequence of the motion of atoms without any purpose. Xenophanes also advanced a critique of anthropomorphic religion by highlighting in a rational way the inconsistency of depictions of the gods in Greek popular religion.\nUndoubtedly, pre-Socratics paved the way towards science, but whether what they did could constitute science is a matter of debate. Thales had offered the first account of a reduction and a generalization, a significant milestone towards scientific thought. Other pre-Socratics also sought to answer the question of arche, offering various answers, but the first step towards scientific thought was already taken. Philosopher Karl Popper, in his seminal work \"Back to Presocratics\" (1958) traces the roots of modern science (and the West) to the early Greek philosophers. He writes: \"There can be little doubt that the Greek tradition of philosophical criticism had its main source in Ionia\u00a0... It thus leads the tradition which created the rational or scientific attitude, and with it our Western civilization, the only civilization, which is based upon science (though, of course, not upon science alone).\" Elsewhere in the same study Popper diminishes the significance of the label they should carry as purely semantics. \"There is the most perfect possible continuity of thought between [the Presocratics'] theories and the later developments in physics. Whether they are called philosophers, or pre-scientists, or scientists, matters very little.\" Other scholars did not share the same view. F. M. Cornford considered the Ionanians as dogmatic speculators, due to their lack of empiricism.\nReception and legacy.\nAntiquity.\nThe pre-Socratics had a direct influence on classical antiquity in many ways. The philosophic thought produced by the pre-Socratics heavily influenced later philosophers, historians and playwrights. One line of influence was the Socrato-Ciceronian tradition, while the other was the Platonic-Aristotelian.\nSocrates, Xenophon and Cicero were highly influenced by the \"physiologoi\" (naturalists) as they were named in ancient times. The naturalists impressed young Socrates and he was interested in the quest for the substance of the cosmos, but his interest waned as he became steadily more focused on epistemology, virtue, and ethics rather than the natural world. According to Xenophon, the reason was that Socrates believed humans incapable of comprehending the cosmos. Plato, in the \"Phaedo\", claims that Socrates was uneasy with the materialistic approach of the pre-Socratics, particularly Anaxagoras. Cicero analyzed his views on the pre-Socratics in his \"Tusculanae Disputationes\", as he distinguished the theoretical nature of pre-Socratic thought from previous \"sages\" who were interested in more practical issues. Xenophon, like Cicero, saw the difference between pre-Socratics and Socrates being his interest in human affairs (\"ta anthropina\").\nThe pre-Socratics deeply influenced both Plato and Aristotle. Aristotle discussed the pre-Socratics in the first book of \"Metaphysics\", as an introduction to his own philosophy and the quest for \"arche\". He was the first to state that philosophy starts with Thales. It is not clear whether Thales talked of water as \"arche\", or that was a retrospective interpretation by Aristotle, who was examining his predecessors under the scope of his views. More crucially, Aristotle criticized the pre-Socratics for not identifying a purpose as a final cause, a fundamental idea in Aristotelian metaphysics. Plato also attacked pre-Socratic materialism.\nLater, during the Hellenistic era, philosophers of various currents focused on the study of nature and advanced pre-Socratic ideas. The Stoics incorporated features from Anaxagoras and Heraclitus, such as \"nous\" and fire respectively. The Epicureans saw Democritus' atomism as their predecessor while the Sceptics were linked to Xenophanes.\nModern era.\nThe pre-Socratics, along with the rest of ancient Greece, invented the central concepts of Western civilization: freedom, democracy, individual autonomy and rationalism. Francis Bacon, a 16th-century philosopher known for advancing the scientific method, was probably the first philosopher of the modern era to use pre-Socratic axioms extensively in his texts. He criticized the pre-Socratic theory of knowledge by Xenophanes and others, claiming that their deductive reasoning could not yield meaningful results\u2014an opinion contemporary philosophy of science rejects. Bacon's fondness for the pre-Socratics, especially Democritus' atomist theory, might have been because of his anti-Aristotelianism.\nFriedrich Nietzsche admired the pre-Socratics deeply, calling them \"tyrants of the spirit\" to mark their antithesis and his preference against Socrates and his successors. Nietzsche also weaponized pre-Socratic antiteleology, coupled with the materialism exemplified by Democritus, for his attack on Christianity and its morals. Nietzsche saw the pre-Socratics as the first ancestors of contemporary science\u2014linking Empedocles to Darwinism and Heraclitus to physicist Helmholtz. According to his narrative, limned in many of his books, the pre-Socratic era was the glorious era of Greece, while the so-called Golden Age that followed was an age of decay. Nietzsche incorporated the pre-Socratics in his Apollonian and Dionysian dialectics, with them representing the creative Dionysian aspect of the duo. \nMartin Heidegger found the roots of his phenomenology and later thinking of Things and the Fourfold in the pre-Socratics, considering Anaximander, Parmenides, and Heraclitus as the original thinkers on being, which he identified in their work as \"physis\" [\u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2] (emergence, contrasted against \u03ba\u03c1\u03cd\u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9, kryptesthai, in Heraclitus' Fragment 123) or \"aletheia\" [\u1f00\u03bb\u03ae\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1] (truth as unconcealment).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Transliterations are designed to convey the pronunciation of the original word in a different script, allowing readers or speakers of that script to approximate the sounds and pronunciation of the original word. Transliterations do not change the pronunciation of the word. Thus, in the Greek above example, \u27e8\u03bb\u03bb\u27e9 is transliterated \u27e8ll\u27e9 though it is pronounced exactly the same way as , or the Greek letters, \u27e8\u03bb\u03bb\u27e9. \u27e8\u0394\u27e9 is transliterated \u27e8D\u27e9 though pronounced as , and \u27e8\u03b7\u27e9 is transliterated \u27e8\u0113\u27e9, though it is pronounced (exactly like \u27e8\u03b9\u27e9) and is not long.\nTranscription, conversely, seeks to capture sound, but phonetically approximate it into the new script; \u27e8\u27e9 corresponds to in the International Phonetic Alphabet. While differentiation is lost in the case of , note the allophonic realization of as a palatalized when preceding front vowels and .\nAngle brackets may be used to set off transliteration, as opposed to slashes /\u2009/ for phonemic transcription and square brackets for phonetic transcription. Angle brackets may also be used to set off characters in the original script. Conventions and author preferences vary.\nDefinitions.\nSystematic transliteration is a mapping from one system of writing into another, typically grapheme to grapheme. Most transliteration systems are one-to-one, so a reader who knows the system can reconstruct the original spelling.\nTransliteration, which adapts written form without altering the pronunciation when spoken out, is opposed to letter transcription, which is a \"letter by letter conversion\" of one language into \"another writing system\". Still, most systems of transliteration map the letters of the source script to letters pronounced similarly in the target script, for some specific pair of source and target language. Transliteration may be very close to letter-by-letter transcription if the relations between letters and sounds are similar in both languages.\nFor many script pairs, there are one or more standard transliteration systems. However, unsystematic transliteration is common, as for Burmese, for instance.\nDifference from transcription.\nIn Modern Greek, the letters \u27e8\u03b7, \u03b9, \u03c5\u27e9 and the letter combinations \u27e8\u03b5\u03b9, o\u03b9, \u03c5\u03b9\u27e9 are pronounced (except when pronounced as semivowels), and a modern transcription renders them as \u27e8i\u27e9. However, a transliteration distinguishes them; for example, by transliterating them as \u27e8\u0113, i, y\u27e9 and \u27e8ei, oi, yi\u27e9. (As the ancient pronunciation of \u27e8\u03b7\u27e9 was , it is often transliterated as \u27e8\u0113\u27e9.) On the other hand, \u27e8\u03b1\u03c5, \u03b5\u03c5, \u03b7\u03c5\u27e9 are pronounced , and are voiced to when followed by a voiced consonant \u2013 a shift from Ancient Greek . A transliteration would render them all as \u27e8au, eu, iu\u27e9 no matter the environment these sounds are in, reflecting the traditional orthography of Ancient Greek, yet a transcription would distinguish them, based on their phonemic and allophonic pronunciations in Modern Greek. Furthermore, the initial letter \u27e8h\u27e9 reflecting the historical rough breathing \u27e8 \u0314\u27e9 in words such as \u27e8Hell\u0113nik\u1e17\u27e9 would intuitively be omitted in transcription for Modern Greek, as Modern Greek no longer has the sound.\nChallenges.\nA simple example of difficulties in transliteration is the Arabic letter q\u0101f. It is pronounced, in literary Arabic, approximately like English [k], except that the tongue makes contact not on the soft palate but on the uvula, but the pronunciation varies between different dialects of Arabic. The letter is sometimes transliterated into \"g\", sometimes into \"q\" or \"'\" (for in Egypt it is silent) and rarely even into \"k\" in English. Another example is the Russian letter \"\u0425\" (kha). It is pronounced as the voiceless velar fricative , like the Scottish pronunciation of \u27e8ch\u27e9 in \"loch\". This sound is not present in most forms of English and is often transliterated as \"kh\" as in Nikita Khrushchev. Many languages have phonemic sounds, such as click consonants, which are quite unlike any phoneme in the language into which they are being transliterated.\nSome languages and scripts present particular difficulties to transcribers. These are discussed on separate pages.

{"id": "30343", "revid": "7770027", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30343", "title": "Torah", "text": "First five books of the Hebrew Bible\nThe Torah (; ) is the compilation of the first five books of the Hebrew Bible, namely the books of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy. The Torah is also known as the Pentateuch () or the Five Books of Moses. In Rabbinical Jewish tradition it is also known as the Written Torah (, ). If meant for liturgic purposes, it takes the form of a Torah scroll ( \"Sefer Torah\"). If in bound book form, it is called \"Chumash\", and is usually printed with the rabbinic commentaries ().\nIn rabbinic literature, the word \"Torah\" denotes both the five books (, \"Torah that is written\") and the Oral Torah (, \"Torah that is spoken\"). It has also been used, however, to designate the entire Hebrew Bible. The Oral Torah consists of interpretations and amplifications which according to rabbinic tradition have been handed down from generation to generation and are now embodied in the Talmud and Midrash. Rabbinic tradition's understanding is that all of the teachings found in the Torah (both written and oral) were given by God through the prophet Moses, some at Mount Sinai and others at the Tabernacle, and all the teachings were written down by Moses, which resulted in the Torah that exists today. According to the Midrash, the Torah was created prior to the creation of the world, and was used as the blueprint for Creation. Though hotly debated, the general trend in biblical scholarship is to recognize the final form of the Torah as a literary and ideological unity, based on earlier sources, largely complete by the Persian period, with possibly some later additions during the Hellenistic period.\nThe words of the Torah are written on a scroll by a scribe (sofer) in Hebrew. A Torah portion is read every Monday morning and Thursday morning at a shul (synagogue) and as noted later in this article a part is also read on Saturdays. In some synagogues, but not all, the reading is done only if there are ten males above the age of thirteen. Today most \"movements\" of Judaism accept ten adult Jews as meeting the requirement for reading a Torah portion. Reading the Torah publicly is one of the bases of Jewish communal life. The Torah is also considered a sacred book outside Judaism; in Samaritanism, the Samaritan Pentateuch is a text of the Torah written in the Samaritan script and used as sacred scripture by the Samaritans; the Torah is also common among all the different versions of the Christian Old Testament; in Islam, the \"Tawrat\" () is the Arabic name for the Torah within its context as an Islamic holy book believed by Muslims to have been given by God to the prophets and messengers amongst the Children of Israel.\nMeaning and names.\nThe word \"Torah\" in Hebrew is derived from the root , which in the \"hif'il\" conjugation means 'to guide' or 'to teach'. The meaning of the word is therefore \"teaching\", \"doctrine\", or \"instruction\"; the commonly accepted \"law\" gives a wrong impression. The Alexandrian Jews who translated the Septuagint used the Greek word \"nomos\", meaning norm, standard, doctrine, and later \"law\". Greek and Latin Bibles then began the custom of calling the Pentateuch (five books of Moses) The Law. Other translational contexts in the English language include custom, theory, guidance, or system.\nThe term \"Torah\" is also used in the general sense to include both Rabbinic Judaism's written and oral law, serving to encompass the entire spectrum of authoritative Jewish religious teachings throughout history, including the Oral Torah which comprises the Mishnah, the Talmud, the Midrash and more. The inaccurate rendering of \"Torah\" as \"Law\" may be an obstacle to understanding the ideal that is summed up in the term \"talmud torah\" (, \"study of Torah\"). The term \"Torah\" is also used to designate the entire Hebrew Bible.\nThe earliest name for the first part of the Bible seems to have been \"The Torah of Moses\". This title, however, is found neither in the Torah itself, nor in the works of the pre-Exilic literary prophets. It appears in Joshua and Kings, but it cannot be said to refer there to the entire corpus (according to academic Bible criticism). In contrast, there is every likelihood that its use in the post-Exilic works was intended to be comprehensive. Other early titles were \"The Book of Moses\" and \"The Book of the Torah\", which seems to be a contraction of a fuller name, \"The Book of the Torah of God\".\nAlternative names.\nScholars usually refer to the first five books of the Hebrew Bible as the 'Pentateuch' (, ; , 'five scrolls'), a term first used in the Hellenistic Judaism of Alexandria. The term comes via Latin \"pentateuchus\" from Greek \u03c0\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03ac\u03c4\u03b5\u03c5\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 \"(pent\u00e1teuchos)\", literally \"five-volume [work]\" (\u03c0\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5 \"five\", \u03c4\u03b5\u1fe6\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 \"scroll\" / \"book\"). In Hellenistic usage it denoted the Torah's five scrolls.\nThe \"Tawrat\" (also Tawrah or Taurat; ) is the Arabic name for the Torah, which Muslims believe is an Islamic holy book given by God to the prophets and messengers amongst the Children of Israel.\nContents.\nThe Torah starts with God creating the world, then describes the beginnings of the people of Israel, their descent into Egypt, and the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai. It ends with the death of Moses, just before the people of Israel cross to the Promised Land of Canaan. Interspersed in the narrative are the specific teachings (religious obligations and civil laws) given explicitly (i.e. Ten Commandments) or implicitly embedded in the narrative (as in Exodus 12 and 13 laws of the celebration of Passover).\nIn Hebrew, the five books of the Torah are identified by the incipits in each book; and the common English names for the books are derived from the Greek Septuagint and reflect the essential theme of each book:\nGenesis.\nThe Book of Genesis is the first book of the Torah. It is divisible into two parts, the Primeval history (chapters 1\u201311) and the Ancestral history (chapters 12\u201350). The primeval history sets out the author's (or authors') concepts of the nature of the deity and of humankind's relationship with its maker: God creates a world which is good and fit for mankind, but when man corrupts it with sin God decides to destroy his creation, using the flood, saving only the righteous Noah and his immediate family to reestablish the relationship between man and God. The Ancestral history (chapters 12\u201350) tells of the prehistory of Israel, God's chosen people. At God's command Noah's descendant Abraham journeys from his home into the God-given land of Canaan, where he dwells as a sojourner, as does his son Isaac and his grandson Jacob. Jacob's name is changed to Israel, and through the agency of his son Joseph, the children of Israel descend into Egypt, 70 people in all with their households, and God promises them a future of greatness. Genesis ends with Israel in Egypt, ready for the coming of Moses and the Exodus. The narrative is punctuated by a series of covenants with God, successively narrowing in scope from all mankind (the covenant with Noah) to a special relationship with one people alone (Abraham and his descendants through Isaac and Jacob).\nExodus.\nThe Book of Exodus is the second book of the Torah, immediately following Genesis. The book tells how the ancient Israelites leave slavery in Egypt through the strength of Yahweh, the God who has chosen Israel as his people. Yahweh inflicts horrific harm on their captors via the legendary Plagues of Egypt. With the prophet Moses as their leader, they journey through the wilderness to Mount Sinai, where Yahweh promises them the land of Canaan (the \"Promised Land\") in return for their faithfulness. Israel enters into a covenant with Yahweh who gives them their laws and instructions to build the Tabernacle, the means by which he will come from heaven and dwell with them and lead them in a holy war to possess the land, and then give them peace.\nTraditionally ascribed to Moses himself, modern scholarship sees the book as initially a product of the Babylonian exile (6th century BCE), from earlier written and oral traditions, with final revisions in the Persian post-exilic period (5th century BCE). Carol Meyers, in her commentary on Exodus suggests that it is arguably the most important book in the Bible, as it presents the defining features of Israel's identity: memories of a past marked by hardship and escape, a binding covenant with God, who chooses Israel, and the establishment of the life of the community and the guidelines for sustaining it.\nLeviticus.\nThe Book of Leviticus begins with instructions to the Israelites on how to use the Tabernacle, which they had just built (Leviticus 1\u201310). This is followed by rules of clean and unclean (Leviticus 11\u201315), which includes the laws of slaughter and animals permissible to eat (see also: Kashrut), the Day of Atonement (Leviticus 16), and various moral and ritual laws sometimes called the Holiness Code (Leviticus 17\u201326). Leviticus 26 provides a detailed list of rewards for following God's commandments and a detailed list of punishments for not following them. Leviticus 17 establishes sacrifices at the Tabernacle as an everlasting ordinance, but this ordinance is altered in later books with the Temple being the only place in which sacrifices are allowed.\nNumbers.\nThe Book of Numbers is the fourth book of the Torah. The book has a long and complex history, but its final form is probably due to a Priestly redaction (i.e., editing) of a Yahwistic source made some time in the early Persian period (5th century BCE). The name of the book comes from the two censuses taken of the Israelites.\nNumbers begins at Mount Sinai, where the Israelites have received their laws and covenant from God and God has taken up residence among them in the sanctuary. The task before them is to take possession of the Promised Land. The people are counted and preparations are made for resuming their march. The Israelites begin the journey, but they \"murmur\" at the hardships along the way, and about the authority of Moses and Aaron. For these acts, God destroys approximately 15,000 of them through various means. They arrive at the borders of Canaan and send spies into the land. Upon hearing the spies' fearful report concerning the conditions in Canaan, the Israelites refuse to take possession of it. God condemns them to death in the wilderness until a new generation can grow up and carry out the task. The book ends with the new generation of Israelites in the \"plains of Moab\" ready for the crossing of the Jordan River.\nNumbers is the culmination of the story of Israel's exodus from oppression in Egypt and their journey to take possession of the land God promised their fathers. As such it draws to a conclusion the themes introduced in Genesis and played out in Exodus and Leviticus: God has promised the Israelites that they shall become a great (i.e. numerous) nation, that they will have a special relationship with Yahweh their god, and that they shall take possession of the land of Canaan. Numbers also demonstrates the importance of holiness, faithfulness and trust: despite God's presence and his priests, Israel lacks faith and the possession of the land is left to a new generation.\nDeuteronomy.\nThe Book of Deuteronomy is the fifth book of the Torah. Chapters 1\u201330 of the book consist of three sermons or speeches delivered to the Israelites by Moses on the plains of Moab, shortly before they enter the Promised Land. The first sermon recounts the forty years of wilderness wanderings which had led to that moment, and ends with an exhortation to observe the law (or teachings), later referred to as the Law of Moses; the second reminds the Israelites of the need to follow Yahweh and the laws (or teachings) he has given them, on which their possession of the land depends; and the third offers the comfort that even should Israel prove unfaithful and so lose the land, with repentance all can be restored. The final four chapters (31\u201334) contain the Song of Moses, the Blessing of Moses, and narratives recounting the passing of the mantle of leadership from Moses to Joshua and, finally, the death of Moses on Mount Nebo.\nPresented as the words of Moses delivered before the conquest of Canaan, a broad consensus of modern scholars see its origin in traditions from Israel (the northern kingdom) brought south to the Kingdom of Judah in the wake of the Assyrian conquest of Aram (8th century BCE) and then adapted to a program of nationalist reform in the time of Josiah (late 7th century BCE), with the final form of the modern book emerging in the milieu of the return from the Babylonian captivity during the late 6th century BCE. Many scholars see the book as reflecting the economic needs and social status of the Levite caste, who are believed to have provided its authors; those likely authors are collectively referred to as the Deuteronomist.\nOne of its most significant verses is Deuteronomy 6:4, the Shema Yisrael, which has become the definitive statement of Jewish identity: \"Hear, O Israel: the LORD our God, the LORD is one.\" Verses 6:4\u20135 were also quoted by Jesus in Mark 12:28\u201334 as part of the Great Commandment.\nComposition.\nThe Talmud states that the Torah was written by Moses, with the exception of the last eight verses of Deuteronomy, describing his death and burial, being written by Joshua. According to the Mishnah one of the essential tenets of Judaism is that God transmitted the text of the Torah to\u00a0Moses over the span of the 40 years the Israelites were in the desert and Moses was like a scribe who was dictated to and wrote down all of the events, the stories and the commandments.\nAccording to Jewish tradition, the Torah was recompiled by Ezra during Second Temple period. The Talmud says that Ezra changed the script used to write the Torah from the older Hebrew script to the \"Assyrian\" script, so called according to the Talmud, because they brought it with them from Assyria. Maharsha says that Ezra made no changes to the actual text of the Torah based on the Torah's prohibition of making any additions or deletions to the Torah in Deuteronomy 12:32.\nBy contrast, the modern scholarly consensus rejects Mosaic authorship, and affirms that the Torah has multiple authors and that its composition took place over centuries. The precise process by which the Torah was composed, the number of authors involved, and the date of each author are hotly contested. Throughout most of the 20th century, there was a scholarly consensus surrounding the documentary hypothesis, which posits four independent sources, which were later compiled together by a redactor: J, the Jahwist source, E, the Elohist source, P, the Priestly source, and D, the Deuteronomist source. The earliest of these sources, J, would have been composed in the late 7th or the 6th century BCE, with the latest source, P, being composed around the 5th century BCE.\nThe consensus around the documentary hypothesis collapsed in the last decades of the 20th century. The groundwork was laid with the investigation of the origins of the written sources in oral compositions, implying that the creators of J and E were collectors and editors and not authors and historians. Rolf Rendtorff, building on this insight, argued that the basis of the Pentateuch lay in short, independent narratives, gradually formed into larger units and brought together in two editorial phases, the first Deuteronomic, the second Priestly. By contrast, John Van Seters advocates a supplementary hypothesis, which posits that the Torah was derived from a series of direct additions to an existing corpus of work. A \"neo-documentarian\" hypothesis, which responds to the criticism of the original hypothesis and updates the methodology used to determine which text comes from which sources, has been advocated by biblical historian Joel S. Baden, among others. Such a hypothesis continues to have adherents in Israel and North America.\nThe majority of scholars today continue to recognize Deuteronomy as a source, with its origin in the law-code produced at the court of Josiah as described by De Wette, subsequently given a frame during the exile (the speeches and descriptions at the front and back of the code) to identify it as the words of Moses. However, since the 1990s, the biblical description of Josiah's reforms (including his court's production of a law-code) have become heavily debated among academics. Most scholars also agree that some form of Priestly source existed, although its extent, especially its end-point, is uncertain. The remainder is called collectively non-Priestly, a grouping which includes both pre-Priestly and post-Priestly material.\nDate of compilation.\nThe final Torah is widely seen as a product of the Persian period (539\u2013332 BCE, probably 450\u2013350 BCE). This consensus echoes a traditional Jewish view which gives Ezra, the leader of the Jewish community on its return from Babylon, a pivotal role in its promulgation. Many theories have been advanced to explain the composition of the Torah, but two have been especially influential. The first of these, Persian Imperial authorisation, advanced by Peter Frei in 1985, holds that the Persian authorities required the Jews of Jerusalem to present a single body of law as the price of local autonomy. Frei's theory was, according to Eskenazi, \"systematically dismantled\" at an interdisciplinary symposium held in 2000, but the relationship between the Persian authorities and Jerusalem remains a crucial question. The second theory, associated with Joel P. Weinberg and called the \"Citizen-Temple Community\", proposes that the Exodus story was composed to serve the needs of a post-exilic Jewish community organised around the Temple, which acted in effect as a bank for those who belonged to it.\nA minority of scholars would place the final formation of the Pentateuch somewhat later, in the Hellenistic (332\u2013164 BCE) or even Hasmonean (140\u201337 BCE) periods. Russell Gmirkin, for instance, argues for a Hellenistic dating on the basis that the Elephantine papyri, the records of a Jewish colony in Egypt dating from the last quarter of the 5th century BCE, make no reference to a written Torah, the Exodus, or to any other biblical event, though it does mention the festival of Passover.\nAdoption of Torah law.\nIn his seminal \"Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels\", Julius Wellhausen argued that Judaism as a religion based on widespread observance of the Torah and its laws first emerged in 444 BCE when, according to the biblical account provided in the Book of Nehemiah (chapter 8), a priestly scribe named Ezra read a copy of the Mosaic Torah before the populace of Judea assembled in a central Jerusalem square. Wellhausen believed that this narrative should be accepted as historical because it sounds plausible, noting: \"The credibility of the narrative appears on the face of it.\" Following Wellhausen, most scholars throughout the 20th and early 21st centuries have accepted that \nMore recently, Yonatan Adler has argued that in fact there is no surviving evidence to support the notion that the Torah was widely known, regarded as authoritative, and put into practice prior to the middle of the 2nd century BCE. Adler explored the likelihhood that Judaism, as the widespread practice of Torah law by Jewish society at large, first emerged in Judea during the reign of the Hasmonean dynasty, centuries after the putative time of Ezra. However, John J. Collins has argued that Hecataeus of Abdera recorded that the written Mosaic law was already \"known and accepted as the authoritative expression of the Jewish way of life at the beginning of the Hellenistic period\". According to Collins, this implies that Jews were already observing the Torah since the Persian period.\nSignificance in Judaism.\nTraditional views on authorship.\nRabbinic writings state that the Oral Torah was given to Moses at Mount Sinai, which, according to the tradition of Orthodox Judaism, occurred in 1312\u00a0BCE. The Orthodox rabbinic tradition holds that the Written Torah was recorded during the following forty years, though many non-Orthodox Jewish scholars affirm the modern scholarly consensus that the Written Torah has multiple authors and was written over centuries.\nAll classical rabbinic views hold that the Torah was entirely Mosaic and of divine origin. Present-day Reform and Liberal Jewish movements all reject Mosaic authorship, as do most shades of Conservative Judaism.\nRitual use.\nTorah reading (Hebrew: , \"K'riat HaTorah\", \"Reading [of] the Torah\") is a Jewish religious ritual that involves the public reading of a set of passages from a Torah scroll. The term often refers to the entire ceremony of removing the Torah scroll (or scrolls) from the ark, chanting the appropriate excerpt with traditional cantillation, and returning the scroll(s) to the ark. It is distinct from academic Torah study.\nRegular public reading of the Torah was introduced by Ezra the Scribe after the return of the Jewish people from the Babylonian captivity (c.\u2009537\u00a0BCE), as described in the Book of Nehemiah. In the modern era, adherents of Orthodox Judaism practice Torah-reading according to a set procedure they believe has remained unchanged in the two thousand years since the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem (70\u00a0CE). In the 19th and 20th centuries CE, new movements such as Reform Judaism and Conservative Judaism have made adaptations to the practice of Torah reading, but the basic pattern of Torah reading has usually remained the same:\nAs a part of the morning prayer services on certain days of the week, fast days, and holidays, as well as part of the afternoon prayer services of Shabbat, Yom Kippur, a section of the Pentateuch is read from a Torah scroll. On Shabbat (Saturday) mornings, a weekly section (\"parashah\") is read, selected so that the entire Pentateuch is read consecutively each year. The division of \"parashot\" found in the modern-day Torah scrolls of all Jewish communities (Ashkenazic, Sephardic, and Yemenite) is based upon the systematic list provided by Maimonides in Mishneh Torah, \"Laws of Tefillin, Mezuzah and Torah Scrolls\", chapter 8. Maimonides based his division of the for the Torah on the Aleppo Codex. Conservative and Reform synagogues may read \"parashot\" on a triennial rather than annual schedule, On Saturday afternoons, Mondays, and Thursdays, the beginning of the following Saturday's portion is read. On Jewish holidays, the beginnings of each month, and fast days, special sections connected to the day are read.\nJews observe an annual holiday, Simchat Torah, to celebrate the completion and new start of the year's cycle of readings.\nTorah scrolls are often dressed with a sash, a special Torah cover, various ornaments, and a (crown), although such customs vary among synagogues. Congregants traditionally stand in respect when the Torah is brought out of the ark to be read, while it is being carried, and lifted, and likewise while it is returned to the ark, although they may sit during the reading itself.\nBiblical law.\nThe Torah contains narratives, statements of law, and statements of ethics. Collectively these laws, usually called biblical law or commandments, are sometimes referred to as the Law of Moses (\"Torat Mosh\u025b\" ), Mosaic Law, or Sinaitic Law.\nThe Oral Torah.\nRabbinic tradition holds that Moses learned the whole Torah while he lived on Mount Sinai for 40 days and nights and both the Oral and the written Torah were transmitted in parallel with each other. Where the Torah leaves words and concepts undefined, and mentions procedures without explanation or instructions, the reader is required to seek out the missing details from supplemental sources known as the Oral Law or Oral Torah. Some of the Torah's most prominent commandments needing further explanation are:\nAccording to classical rabbinic texts this parallel set of material was originally transmitted to Moses at Sinai, and then from Moses to Israel. At that time it was forbidden to write and publish the oral law, as any writing would be incomplete and subject to misinterpretation and abuse.\nHowever, after exile, dispersion, and persecution, this tradition was lifted when it became apparent that in writing was the only way to ensure that the Oral Law could be preserved. After many years of effort by a great number of tannaim, the oral tradition was written down around 200\u00a0CE by Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi, who took up the compilation of a nominally written version of the Oral Law, the Mishnah (). Other oral traditions from the same time period not entered into the Mishnah were recorded as \"Baraitot\" (external teaching), and the Tosefta. Other traditions were written down as Midrashim.\nAfter continued persecution more of the Oral Law was committed to writing. A great many more lessons, lectures and traditions only alluded to in the few hundred pages of Mishnah, became the thousands of pages now called the \"Gemara\". Gemara is written in Aramaic (specifically Jewish Babylonian Aramaic), having been compiled in Babylon. The Mishnah and Gemara together are called the Talmud. The rabbis in the Land of Israel also collected their traditions and compiled them into the Jerusalem Talmud. Since the greater number of rabbis lived in Babylon, the Babylonian Talmud has precedence should the two be in conflict.\nOrthodox and Conservative branches of Judaism accept these texts as the basis for all subsequent \"halakha\" and codes of Jewish law, which are held to be normative. Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism deny that these texts, or the Torah itself for that matter, may be used for determining normative law (laws accepted as binding) but accept them as the authentic and only Jewish version for understanding the Torah and its development throughout history. Humanistic Judaism holds that the Torah is a historical, political, and sociological text, but does not believe that every word of the Torah is true, or even morally correct. Humanistic Judaism is willing to question the Torah and to disagree with it, believing that the entire Jewish experience, not just the Torah, should be the source for Jewish behavior and ethics.\nDivine significance of letters, Jewish mysticism.\nKabbalists hold that not only do the words of Torah give a divine message, but they also indicate a far greater message that extends beyond them. Thus they hold that even as small a mark as a \"kotso shel yod\" (), the serif of the Hebrew letter \"yod\" (\u05d9), the smallest letter, or decorative markings, or repeated words, were put there by God to teach scores of lessons. This is regardless of whether that yod appears in the phrase \"I am the LORD thy God\" (, Exodus 20:2) or whether it appears in \"And God spoke unto Moses saying\" ( Exodus 6:2). In a similar vein, Rabbi Akiva (c.\u200950\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009135 CE), is said to have learned a new law from every \"et\" () in the Torah (Talmud, tractate Pesachim 22b); the particle \"et\" is meaningless by itself, and serves only to mark the direct object. In other words, the Orthodox belief is that even apparently contextual text such as \"And God spoke unto Moses saying\u00a0...\" is no less holy and sacred than the actual statement.\nProduction and use of a Torah scroll.\nManuscript Torah scrolls are still scribed and used for ritual purposes (i.e., religious services); this is called a \"Sefer Torah\" (\"Book [of] Torah\"). They are written using a painstakingly careful method by highly qualified scribes. It is believed that every word, or marking, has divine meaning and that not one part may be inadvertently changed lest it lead to error. The fidelity of the Hebrew text of the Tanakh, and the Torah in particular, is considered paramount, down to the last letter: translations or transcriptions are frowned upon for formal service use, and transcribing is done with painstaking care. An error of a single letter, ornamentation, or symbol of the 304,805 stylized letters that make up the Hebrew Torah text renders a Torah scroll unfit for use, hence a special skill is required and a scroll takes considerable time to write and check.\nAccording to Jewish law, a \"sefer Torah\" (plural: \"Sifrei Torah\") is a copy of the formal Hebrew text handwritten on \"gevil\" or \"klaf\" (forms of parchment) by using a quill (or other permitted writing utensil) dipped in ink. Written entirely in Hebrew, a \"sefer Torah\" contains 304,805 letters, all of which must be duplicated precisely by a trained \"sofer\" (\"scribe\"), an effort that may take as long as approximately one and a half years. Most modern Sifrei Torah are written with forty-two lines of text per column (Yemenite Jews use fifty), and very strict rules about the position and appearance of the Hebrew letters are observed. See for example the Mishnah Berurah on the subject. Any of several Hebrew scripts may be used, most of which are fairly ornate and exacting.\nThe completion of the Sefer Torah is a cause for great celebration, and it is a mitzvah for every Jew to either write or have written for him a Sefer Torah. Torah scrolls are stored in the holiest part of the synagogue in the Ark known as the \"Holy Ark\" ( \"aron hakodesh\" in Hebrew.) \"Aron\" in Hebrew means \"cupboard\" or \"closet\", and \"kodesh\" is derived from \"kadosh\", or \"holy\".\nTorah translations.\nAramaic.\nThe Book of Ezra refers to translations and commentaries of the Hebrew text into Aramaic, the more commonly understood language of the time. These translations would seem to date to the 6th century BCE. The Aramaic term for \"translation\" is \"Targum\". The \"Encyclopaedia Judaica\" has: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHowever, there is no suggestion that these translations had been written down as early as this. There are suggestions that the Targum was written down at an early date, although for private use only. &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The official recognition of a written Targum and the final redaction of its text, however, belong to the post-Talmudic period, thus not earlier than the fifth century C.E.\nGreek.\nOne of the earliest known translations of the first five books of Moses from the Hebrew into Greek was the Septuagint. This is a Koine Greek version of the Hebrew Bible that was used by Greek speakers. This Greek version of the Hebrew Scriptures dates from the 3rd century BCE, originally associated with Hellenistic Judaism. It contains both a translation of the Hebrew and additional and variant material.\nLater translations into Greek include seven or more other versions. These do not survive, except as fragments, and include those by Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion.\nLatin.\nEarly translations into Latin\u2014the Vetus Latina\u2014were ad hoc conversions of parts of the Septuagint. With Saint Jerome in the 4th century CE came the Vulgate Latin translation of the Hebrew Bible.\nArabic.\nFrom the eighth century CE, the cultural language of Jews living under Islamic rule became Arabic rather than Aramaic. \"Around that time, both scholars and lay people started producing translations of the Bible into Judeo-Arabic using the Hebrew alphabet.\" Later, by the 10th century, it became essential for a standard version of the Bible in Judeo-Arabic. The best known was produced by Saadiah (the Saadia Gaon, aka the Rasag), and continues to be in use today, \"in particular among Yemenite Jewry\".\nRav Sa'adia produced an Arabic translation of the Torah known as \"Targum Tafsir\" and offered comments on Rasag's work. There is a debate in scholarship whether Rasag wrote the first Arabic translation of the Torah.\nModern languages.\nJewish translations.\nThe Torah has been translated by Jewish scholars into most of the major European languages, including English, German, Russian, French, Spanish and others. The most well-known German-language translation was produced by Samson Raphael Hirsch. A number of Jewish English Bible translations have been published, for example by Artscroll publications.\nChristian translations.\nAs a part of the Christian biblical canons, the Torah has been translated into hundreds of languages.\nIn other religions.\nSamaritanism.\nThe Samaritan Torah (\u202e\u0815\u082b\u200e\u202c\u0805\u0813\u0821\u0804\u200e\u200e, ), also called the \"Samaritan Pentateuch\", is the scripture of Samaritanism, which is slightly different from the Torah of Judaism. The \"Samaritan Pentateuch\" was written in the Samaritan script, a direct descendant of the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet that emerged around 600 BCE. Some 6,000 differences exist between the Samaritan and Jewish Masoretic Text, most of which are minor spelling and grammar variations, while others involve significant semantic changes, such as the uniquely Samaritan commandment to construct an altar on Mount Gerizim. Nearly 2,000 textual variations are found to be consistent with the Koine Greek Septuagint, some with the Latin Vulgate. It is reported that Samaritans translated their Pentateuch into Aramaic, Greek and Arabic.\nChristianity.\nAlthough different Christian denominations have slightly different versions of the Old Testament in their Bibles, the Torah as the \"Five Books of Moses\" (or \"the Mosaic Law\") is common among them all.\nIn the Jerusalem Bible (1966), its editors recommend reading the narratives in the Torah or Pentateuch in their traditional order, but also suggests that Leviticus can be aligned with the concluding chapters of the Book of Ezekiel, or with Ezra and Nehemiah, and that Deuteronomy \"may be profitably read\" with the Book of Jeremiah.\nIslam.\nIslam states that the Torah was sent by God. The \"Tawrat\" () is the Arabic name for the Torah within its context as an Islamic holy book believed by Muslims to be given by God to Prophets among the Children of Israel, and often refers to the entire Hebrew Bible. According to the Quran, God says, \"It is He Who has sent down the Book (the Quran) to you with truth, confirming what came before it. And He sent down the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel).\" () However, the Muslims believe that this original revelation was corrupted \"(tahrif)\" (or simply altered by the passage of time and human fallibility) over time by Jewish scribes. The Torah in the Quran is always mentioned with respect in Islam. The Muslims' belief in the Torah, as well as the prophethood of Moses, is one of the fundamental tenets of Islam.\nThe Islamic methodology of () refers to interpreting the Qur'an with/through the Bible. This approach adopts canonical Arabic versions of the Bible, including the Torah, both to illuminate and to add exegetical depth to the reading of the Qur'an. Notable Muslim (commentators) of the Bible and Qur'an who weaved from the Torah together with Qur'anic ones include Abu al-Hakam Abd al-Salam bin al-Isbili of Al-Andalus and Ibrahim bin Umar bin Hasan al-Biqa'i.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "30344", "revid": "12712128", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30344", "title": "Hebrew Bible", "text": "Core group of ancient Hebrew scriptures\nThe Hebrew Bible or Tanakh (, or ; ; ; or ), also known in Hebrew as (; ), is the canonical collection of Hebrew scriptures, comprising the Torah (the five Books of Moses), the Nevi'im (the Books of the Prophets), and the Ketuvim ('Writings', eleven books). Different branches of Judaism and Samaritanism have maintained different versions of the canon, including the 3rd-century BCE Septuagint text used in Second Temple Judaism, the Syriac Peshitta, the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and most recently the 10th-century medieval Masoretic Text compiled by the Masoretes, currently used in Rabbinic Judaism. The terms \"Hebrew Bible\" or \"Hebrew Canon\" are frequently confused with the Masoretic Text; however, the Masoretic Text is a medieval version and one of several texts considered authoritative by different types of Judaism throughout history. The current edition of the Masoretic Text is mostly in Biblical Hebrew, with a few passages in Biblical Aramaic (in the books of Daniel and Ezra, and the verse Jeremiah 10:11).\nThe modern form of the Hebrew Bible that is authoritative in Rabbinic Judaism is the Masoretic Text (7th to 10th centuries CE), which consists of 24 books, divided into chapters and \"pesuqim\" (verses). The Hebrew Bible developed during the Second Temple Period, as the Jews decided which religious texts were of divine origin; the Masoretic Text, compiled by the Jewish scribes and scholars of the Early Middle Ages, comprises the 24 Hebrew and Aramaic books that they considered authoritative. The Hellenized Greek-speaking Jews of Alexandria produced a Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible called \"the Septuagint\", that included books later identified as the Apocrypha, while the Samaritans produced their own edition of the Torah, the Samaritan Pentateuch. Both of these ancient editions of the Hebrew Bible differ significantly from the medieval Masoretic Text.\nIn addition to the Masoretic Text, modern biblical scholars seeking to understand the history of the Hebrew Bible use a range of sources. These include the Septuagint, the Syriac language Peshitta translation, the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Dead Sea Scrolls collection, the Targum Onkelos, and quotations from rabbinic manuscripts. These sources may be older than the Masoretic Text in some cases and often differ from it. These differences have given rise to the theory that yet another text, an Urtext of the Hebrew Bible, once existed and is the source of the versions extant today. However, such an Urtext has never been found, and which of the three commonly known versions (Septuagint, Masoretic Text, Samaritan Pentateuch) is closest to the Urtext is debated.\nThere are many similarities between the Hebrew Bible and the Christian Old Testament. The Protestant Old Testament includes the same books as the Hebrew Bible, but the books are arranged in different orders. The Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, and Assyrian churches include the Deuterocanonical books, which are not included in certain versions of the Hebrew Bible. In Islam, the \"Tawrat\" () is often identified not only with the \"Pentateuch\" (the five books of Moses), but also with the other books of the Hebrew Bible. Scholars increasingly view the Hebrew Bible as a mix of folklore and history, with some narratives after the 9th century BCE partly supported by archaeology but many traditional accounts debated or questioned.\nTerminology.\nTanakh.\n\"Tanakh\" is an acronym, made from the first Hebrew letter of each of the Masoretic Text's three traditional divisions: Torah (literally 'Instruction' or 'Law'), Nevi'im (Prophets), and Ketuvim (Writings)\u2014hence TaNaKh.\nThe three-part division reflected in the acronym is well attested in the rabbinic literature dating from the medieval/Masoretic period. During that period however, the term was not used, rather the proper title was or (), meaning 'reading' or 'that which is read', because the biblical texts were read publicly. The acronym is first recorded in later Masoretic texts and commentary. \"Mikra\" continues to be used in Hebrew to this day, alongside Tanakh, to refer to the Hebrew scriptures. In modern spoken Hebrew, they are interchangeable.\nHebrew Bible.\nMany biblical studies scholars advocate use of the term \"Hebrew Bible\" (or \"Hebrew Scriptures\") as a substitute for less-neutral terms with Jewish or Christian connotations (e.g., \"Tanakh\" or \"Old Testament\"). The Society of Biblical Literature's \"Handbook of Style\", which is the standard for major academic journals like the \"Harvard Theological Review\" and conservative Protestant journals like the \"Bibliotheca Sacra\" and the \"Westminster Theological Journal\", suggests that authors \"be aware of the connotations of alternative expressions such as\u00a0... Hebrew Bible [and] Old Testament\" without prescribing the use of either.\n\"Hebrew\" refers to the original language of the books, but it may also be taken as referring to the Jews of the Second Temple era and their descendants, who preserved the transmission of the Masoretic Text up to the present day. The Hebrew Bible includes small portions in Aramaic (mostly in the books of Daniel and Ezra), written and printed in Aramaic square-script, which was adopted as the Hebrew alphabet after the Babylonian exile.\nContent.\nGenres and themes.\nThe Tanakh includes a variety of genres, including narratives of events set in the past. The Torah (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy) contains legal material. The Book of Psalms is a collection of hymns, but songs are included elsewhere in the Tanakh, such as Exodus 15, 1 Samuel 2, and Jonah 2. Books such as Proverbs and Ecclesiastes are examples of wisdom literature.\nOther books are examples of prophecy. In the prophetic books, a prophet denounces evil or predicts what God will do in the future. A prophet might also describe and interpret visions. The Book of Daniel is the only book in the Tanakh usually described as apocalyptic literature. However, other books or parts of books have been called proto-apocalyptic, such as Isaiah 24\u201327, Joel, and Zechariah 9\u201314.\nA central theme throughout the Tanakh is monotheism, worshiping one God. The Tanakh was created by the Israelites, a people who lived within the cultural and religious context of the ancient Near East. The religions of the ancient Near East were polytheistic, but the Israelites rejected polytheism in favor of monotheism. Biblical scholar Christine Hayes writes that the Hebrew Bible was \"the record of [the Israelites'] religious and cultural revolution\".\nAccording to biblical scholar John Barton, \"YHWH is consistently presented throughout the [Hebrew Scriptures] as the God who created the world, and as the only God with whom Israel is to be concerned\". This special relationship between God and Israel is described in terms of covenant. As part of the covenant, God gives his people the Promised Land as an eternal possession. The God of the covenant is also a God of redemption. God liberates his people from Egypt and continually intervenes to save them from their enemies.\nThe Tanakh imposes ethical requirements, including social justice and ritual purity &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;. The Tanakh forbids the exploitation of widows, orphans, and other vulnerable groups. In addition, the Tanakh condemns murder, theft, bribery, corruption, deceitful trading, adultery, incest, bestiality, and homosexual acts. Another theme of the Tanakh is theodicy, showing that God is just even though evil and suffering are present in the world.\nNarrative.\nThe Tanakh begins with the Genesis creation narrative. Genesis 12\u201350 traces Israelite origins to the patriarchs: Abraham, his son Isaac, and grandson Jacob. God promises Abraham and his descendants blessing and land. The covenant God makes with Abraham is signified by male circumcision. The children of Jacob become the ancestors of the twelve tribes of Israel. Jacob's son Joseph is sold into slavery by his brothers, but he becomes a powerful man in Egypt. During a famine, Jacob and his family settle in Egypt.\nJacob's descendants lived in Egypt for 430 years. After the Exodus, the Israelites wander in the wilderness for 40 years. God gives the Israelites the Law of Moses to guide their behavior. The law includes rules for both religious ritual and ethics &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;. This moral code requires justice and care for the poor, widows, and orphans. The biblical story affirms God's unconditional love for his people, but he still punishes them when they fail to live by the covenant.\nGod leads Israel into the Promised Land of Canaan, which they conquer after five years. For the next 470 years, the Israelites were led by judges. In time, a new enemy emerged called the Philistines. They continued to trouble Israel when the prophet Samuel was judge (1 Samuel 4:1\u20137:1). When Samuel grew old, the people requested that he choose a king because Samuel's sons were corrupt and they wanted to be like other nations (1 Samuel 8). The Tanakh presents this negatively as a rejection of God's kingship; nevertheless, God permits it, and Saul of the tribe of Benjamin is anointed king. This inaugurates the united monarchy of the Kingdom of Israel.\nAn officer in Saul's army named David achieves great militarily success. Saul tries to kill him out of jealousy, but David successfully escapes (1 Samuel 16\u201329). After Saul dies fighting the Philistines (1 Samuel 31; 2 Chronicles 10), the kingdom is divided between his son Eshbaal and David (David ruled his tribe of Judah and Eshbaal ruled the rest). After Eshbaal's assassination, David was anointed king over all of Israel (2 Samuel 2\u20135).\nDavid captures the Jebusite city of Jerusalem (2 Samuel 5:6\u20137) and makes it his capital. Jerusalem's location between Judah in the southern hills and the northern Israelite tribes made it an ideal location from which to rule over all the tribes. He further increased Jerusalem's importance by bringing the Ark of the Covenant there from Shiloh (2 Samuel 6). David's son Solomon built the First Temple in Jerusalem.\nAfter Solomon's death, the united kingdom split into the northern Kingdom of Israel (also known as the Kingdom of Samaria) with its capital at Samaria and the southern Kingdom of Judah with its capital at Jerusalem. The Kingdom of Samaria survived for 200 years until it was conquered by the Assyrians in 722\u00a0BCE. The Kingdom of Judah survived for longer, but it was conquered by the Babylonians in 586\u00a0BCE. The Temple was destroyed, and many Judeans were exiled to Babylon. In 539\u00a0BCE, Babylon was conquered by Cyrus the Great of Persia, who allowed the exiles to return to Judah. Between 520 and 515\u00a0BCE, the Temple was rebuilt &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;.\nDevelopment.\nTraditional attribution.\nReligious tradition ascribes authorship of the Torah to Moses. In later Biblical texts, such as Daniel 9:11 and Ezra 3:2, it is referred to as the \"Torah (Law) of Moses\". However, the Torah itself credits Moses with writing only some specific sections. It is theorized that Moses would have lived in the 2nd millennium BCE, but this was before the development of Hebrew writing. The Torah is dated to the 1st millennium BCE after Israel and Judah had already developed as states. Nevertheless, \"it is highly likely that extensive oral transmission of proverbs, stories, and songs took place during this period\", and these may have been included in the Hebrew Bible. Elements of Genesis 12\u201350, which describes the patriarchal age, and the Book of Exodus may reflect oral traditions. In these stories, Israelite ancestors such as Jacob and Moses use trickery and deception to survive and thrive.\nKing David (c.\u20091000 BCE) is credited as the author of at least 73 of the Biblical Psalms. His son, Solomon, is identified as the author of Book of Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Solomon. The Hebrew Bible describes their reigns as a golden age when Israel flourished both culturally and militarily. However, there is no archeological evidence for this, and it is most likely a \"retrospective extrapolation\" of conditions under King Jeroboam II (r.\u2009781\u00a0\u2013\u00a0742 BCE).\nBefore the exile.\nModern scholars, like Israel Finkelstein, believe that the ancient Israelites mostly originated from within Canaan. Their material culture was closely related to their Canaanite neighbors, and Hebrew was a Canaanite dialect. Archaeological evidence indicates Israel began as loosely organized tribal villages in the hill country of modern-day Israel c.\u20091250\u00a0\u2013 c.\u20091000 BCE. During crises, these tribes formed temporary alliances. The Book of Judges, written c.\u2009600 BCE (around 500 years after the events it describes), portrays Israel as a grouping of decentralized tribes, and the Song of Deborah in Judges 5 may reflect older oral traditions. It features archaic elements of Hebrew and a tribal list that identifies Israel exclusively with the northern tribes.\nBy the 9th or 8th centuries BCE, the scribal culture of Samaria and Judah was sufficiently developed to produce biblical texts. The Kingdom of Samaria was more powerful and culturally advanced than the Kingdom of Judah. It also featured multiple cultic sites, including the sanctuaries at Bethel and Dan.\nScholars estimate that the Jacob tradition (Genesis 25\u201335) was first written down in the 8th century BCE and probably originated in the north because the stories occur there. Based on the prominence given to the sanctuary at Bethel (Genesis 28), these stories were likely preserved and written down at that religious center. This means the Jacob cycle must be older than the time of King Josiah of Judah (r.\u2009640\u00a0\u2013\u00a0609 BCE), who pushed for the centralization of worship at Jerusalem.\nThe story of Moses and the Exodus appears to also originate in the north. It existed as a self-contained story in its oral and earliest written forms, but it was connected to the patriarchal stories during the exile or post-exile periods. The account of Moses's birth (Exodus 2) shows similarities to the birth of Sargon of Akkad, which suggests Neo-Assyrian influence sometime after 722 BCE. While the Moses story is set in Egypt, it is used to tell both an anti-Assyrian and anti-imperial message, all while appropriating Assyrian story patterns. David M. Carr notes the possibility of an early oral tradition for the Exodus story: \"To be sure, there may have been a 'Moses group,' themselves of Canaanite extraction, who experienced slavery and liberation from Egypt, but most scholars believe that such a group\u2014if it existed\u2014was only a small minority in early Israel, even though their story came to be claimed by all.\"\nScholars believe Psalm 45 could have northern origins since it refers to a king marrying a foreign princess, a policy of the Omrides. Some psalms may have originated from the shrine in the northern city of Dan. These are the Sons of Korah psalms, Psalm 29, and Psalm 68. The city of Dan probably became an Israelite city during the reign of King Jeroboam II (781\u2013742BCE). Before then, it belonged to Aram, and Psalm 20 is nearly identical to an Aramaic psalm found in the 4th century BCE Papyrus Amherst 63.\nThe author of the Books of Kings likely lived in Jerusalem. The text shows a clear bias favoring Judah, where God's worship was centralized in Jerusalem. The Kingdom of Samaria is portrayed as a godless breakaway region whose rulers refuse to worship at Jerusalem.\nFixing the canon.\nThe books that make up the Hebrew Bible were composed and edited in stages over several hundred years. According to biblical scholar John J. Collins, \"It now seems clear that all the Hebrew Bible received its final shape in the postexilic, or Second Temple, period.\"\nTraditionally, Moses was considered the author of the Torah, and this part of the Tanakh achieved authoritative or canonical status first, possibly as early as the 5th century BCE. This is suggested by Ezra 7:6, which describes Ezra as \"a scribe skilled in the law (\"torah\") of Moses that the Lord the God of Israel had given\".\nThe Nevi'im had gained canonical status by the 2nd century BCE. There are references to the \"Law and the Prophets\" in the Book of Sirach, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and the New Testament. The Book of Daniel, written c.\u2009164 BCE, was not grouped with the Prophets presumably because the Nevi'im collection was already fixed by this time.\nThe Ketuvim was the last part of the Tanakh to achieve canonical status. The prologue to the Book of Sirach mentions \"other writings\" along with the Law and Prophets but does not specify the content. The Gospel of Luke refers to \"the Law of Moses, the prophets, and the psalms\" (Luke 24:44). These references suggest that the content of the Ketuvim remained fluid until the canonization process was completed in the 2nd-century CE.\nThere is no scholarly consensus as to when the Hebrew Bible canon was fixed: some scholars argue that it was fixed by the Hasmonean dynasty, while others argue it was not fixed until the second century CE or even later. The speculated late-1st-century Council of Jamnia was once credited with fixing the Hebrew canon, but modern scholars believe there was no such authoritative council of rabbis. Between 70 and 100\u00a0CE, rabbis debated whether certain books \"make the hands unclean\" (meaning the books are holy and should be considered scripture), and references to fixed numbers of canonical books appear. There were several criteria for inclusion. Books had to be older than the 4th century BCE or attributed to an author who had lived before that period. The original language had to be Hebrew, and books had to be widely used. Many books considered scripture by certain Jewish communities were excluded during this time.\nThere are various textual variants in the Hebrew Bible resulting from centuries of hand-copying. Scribes introduced thousands of minor changes to the biblical texts. Sometimes, these changes were by accident. At other times, scribes intentionally added clarifications or theological material. In the Middle Ages, Jewish scribes produced the Masoretic Text, which became the authoritative version of the Tanakh. Ancient Hebrew was written without vowels, but the Masoretes added vowel markings to the text to ensure accuracy.\nRabbi and Talmudic scholar Louis Ginzberg wrote in \"Legends of the Jews\", published in 1909, that the twenty-four book canon was fixed by Ezra and the scribes in the Second Temple period. According to the Talmud, much of the Tanakh was compiled by the men of the Great Assembly (\"Anshei K'nesset HaGedolah\"), a task completed in 450 BCE, and it has remained unchanged ever since. The 24-book canon is mentioned in the Midrash Koheleth 12:12: \"Whoever brings together in his house more than twenty four books brings confusion\".\nLanguage and pronunciation.\nThe original writing system of the Hebrew text was an abjad: consonants written with some applied vowel letters (\"matres lectionis\"). During the early Middle Ages, scholars known as the Masoretes created a single formalized system of vocalization. This was chiefly done by Aaron ben Moses ben Asher, in the Tiberias school, based on the oral tradition for reading the Tanakh, hence the name Tiberian vocalization. It also included some innovations of Ben Naphtali and the Babylonian exiles. Despite the comparatively late process of codification, some traditional sources and some Orthodox Jews hold the pronunciation and cantillation to derive from the revelation at Sinai, since it is impossible to read the original text without pronunciations and cantillation pauses. The combination of a text ( \"mikra\"), pronunciation ( \"niqqud\") and cantillation ( \"te`amim\") enable the reader to understand both the simple meaning and the nuances in sentence flow of the text.\nNumber of different words used.\nThe number of distinct words in the Hebrew Bible is 8,679, of which 1,480 are hapax legomena, words or expressions that occur only once. The number of distinct Semitic roots, on which many of these biblical words are based, is roughly 2000.\nBooks.\nThe Tanakh consists of twenty-four books, counting as one book each 1 Samuel and 2 Samuel, 1 Kings and 2 Kings, 1 Chronicles and 2 Chronicles, and Ezra\u2013Nehemiah. The Twelve Minor Prophets () are also counted as a single book. In Hebrew, the books are often referred to by their prominent first words.\nTorah.\nThe Torah (, literally \"teaching\") is also known as the \"Pentateuch\", or as the \"Five Books of Moses\". Printed versions (rather than scrolls) of the Torah are often called ( \"Five fifth-sections of the Torah\") and informally as .\nNevi'im.\n\"Nevi'im\" ( , \"Prophets\") is the second main division of the Tanakh, between the Torah and Ketuvim. This division includes the books which cover the time from the entrance of the Israelites into the Land of Israel until the Babylonian captivity of Judah (the \"period of prophecy\"). Their distribution is not chronological, but substantive.\nThe Former Prophets ( ):\nThe Latter Prophets ( ):\nThe Twelve Minor Prophets (, , \"The Twelve\"), which are considered one book:\nKetuvim.\n (, \"Writings\") consists of eleven books.\nPoetic books.\nIn Masoretic manuscripts (and some printed editions), Psalms, Proverbs and Job are presented in a special two-column form emphasizing the parallel stichs in the verses, which are a function of their poetry. Collectively, these three books are known as (an acronym of the titles in Hebrew, yields , which is also the Hebrew for \"truth\").\nThese three books are also the only ones in Tanakh with a special system of cantillation notes that are designed to emphasize parallel stichs within verses. However, the beginning and end of the book of Job are in the normal prose system.\nFive scrolls.\nThe five relatively short books of the Song of Songs, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, and Esther are collectively known as the (Five Megillot).\nIn many Jewish communities, these books are read aloud in the synagogue on particular occasions, the occasion listed below in parentheses.\nOther books.\nBesides the three poetic books and the five scrolls, the remaining books in Ketuvim are Daniel, Ezra\u2013Nehemiah and Chronicles. Although there is no formal grouping for these books in the Jewish tradition, they nevertheless share a number of distinguishing characteristics: their narratives all openly describe relatively late events (i.e. the Babylonian captivity and the subsequent restoration of Zion); the Talmudic tradition ascribes late authorship to all of them; two of them (Daniel and Ezra) are the only books in Tanakh with significant portions in Aramaic.\nBook order.\nThe Jewish textual tradition never finalized the order of the books in Ketuvim. The Talmud gives their order as Ruth, Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Lamentations, Daniel, Scroll of Esther, Ezra, Chronicles. This order is roughly chronological (assuming traditional authorship).\nIn Tiberian Masoretic codices (including the Aleppo Codex and the Leningrad Codex), and often in old Spanish manuscripts as well, the order is Chronicles, Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Ruth, Song of Songs, Ecclesiastes, Lamentations, Esther, Daniel, Ezra. This order is more thematic (e.g. the \"megillot\" are listed together).\nNumber of books.\nThe Hebrew Bible is generally considered to consist of 24 books, but this number is somewhat arbitrary, as (for example) it regards 12 separate books of minor prophets as a single book. The traditional rabbinic count of 24 books appears in the Talmud and numerous works of midrash. In several early nonrabbinic sources, the number of books given is 22. This number corresponds to the letters of the Hebrew alphabet; according to Athanasius of Alexandria there were 27 books, corresponding to the alphabet with final letter forms (\"sofiot\").\nThe count of 24 was said to be equal to the number of priestly divisions. According to a modern source, the number of books may be related to the division of the Iliad and Odyssey into 24 books, corresponding to the letters of the Greek alphabet. Both the Bible and Homer formed \"foundational literature\" of their respective cultures, studied by children and considered distillations of the society's values. The division of the Bible into 22 books may be a conversion of the Greek system to the Hebrew alphabet, while the division into 24 may be an adoption of the \"perfect\" number 24 as befitting the Bible's stature in Jewish eyes.\nNach.\nNach, also anglicized &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Nakh, refers to the Nevi'im and Ketuvim portions of Tanakh. Nach is often referred to as its own subject, separate from Torah.\nIt is a major subject in the curriculum of Orthodox high schools for girls and in the seminaries which they subsequently attend, and is often taught by different teachers than those who teach Chumash. The curriculum of Orthodox high schools for boys includes only some portions of Nach, such as the book of Joshua, the book of Judges, and the Five Megillot.\nSee .\nHistoricity.\nEarly scholarship.\nSome of the stories of the Pentateuch may derive from older sources. Scholars such as Andrew R. George point out the similarity between the Genesis flood narrative and the Gilgamesh flood myth. Similarities between the origin story of Moses and that of Sargon of Akkad were noted by psychoanalyst Otto Rank in 1909 and popularized by 20th-century writers, such as H.\u00a0G. Wells and Joseph Campbell. Jacob Bronowski writes that \"the Bible is ... part folklore and part record. History is ... written by the victors, and the Israelis, when they burst through [Jericho (c.\u20091400 BCE)], became the carriers of history.\"\nRecent scholarship.\nIn 2007, a historian of ancient Judaism Lester L. Grabbe explained that earlier biblical scholars such as Julius Wellhausen (1844\u20131918) could be described as 'maximalist', accepting biblical text unless it has been disproven. Continuing in this tradition, both \"the 'substantial historicity' of the patriarchs\" and \"the unified conquest of the land\" were widely accepted in the United States until about the 1970s. Contrarily, Grabbe says that those in his field now \"are all minimalists\u00a0\u2013 at least, when it comes to the patriarchal period and the settlement. ... [V]ery few are willing to operate [as maximalists].\"\nIn 2022, archaeologist Avraham Faust summarized recent scholarship arguing that while early histories of Israel were heavily based on biblical accounts, their reliability has been increasingly questioned over time. He continued that key debates have focused on the historicity of the Patriarchs, the Exodus, the Israelite conquest, and the United Monarchy, with archaeological evidence often challenging these narratives. He concluded that while the minimalist school of the 1990s dismissed the Bible\u2019s historical value, mainstream scholarship has balanced skepticism with evidence, recognizing that some biblical traditions align with archaeological findings, particularly from the 9th century BCE onward.\nJewish commentaries.\nThe major commentary used for the Chumash is the Rashi commentary. The Rashi commentary and Metzudot commentary are the major commentaries for the Nach.\nThere are two major approaches to the study of, and commentary on, the Tanakh. In the Jewish community, the classical approach is a religious study of the Bible, where it is assumed that the Bible is divinely inspired. Another approach is to study the Bible as a human creation. In this approach, Biblical studies can be considered as a sub-field of religious studies. The latter practice, when applied to the Torah, is considered heresy by the Orthodox Jewish community. As such, much modern day Bible commentary written by non-Orthodox authors is considered forbidden by rabbis teaching in Orthodox yeshivas. Some classical rabbinic commentators, such as Abraham ibn Ezra, Gersonides, and Maimonides, used many elements of contemporary biblical criticism, including their knowledge of history, science, and philology. Their use of historical and scientific analysis of the Bible was considered acceptable by historic Judaism due to the author's faith commitment to the idea that God revealed the Torah to Moses on Mount Sinai.\nThe Modern Orthodox Jewish community allows for a wider array of biblical criticism to be used for biblical books outside of the Torah, and a few Orthodox commentaries now incorporate many of the techniques previously found in the\nacademic world, e.g. the Da'at Miqra series. Non-Orthodox Jews, including those affiliated with Conservative Judaism and Reform Judaism, accept both traditional and secular approaches to Bible studies. \"Jewish commentaries on the Bible\", discusses Jewish Tanakh commentaries from the Targums to classical rabbinic literature, the midrash literature, the classical medieval commentators, and modern-day commentaries.\nInfluence on Jewish identity.\nMultiple scholars have noted the importance of the Hebrew Bible in developing the ethnic and national identity of the Jewish people in antiquity. Fergus Millar wrote that the Bible, serving as \"both a national history and a source of law,\" was one of several key sources that helped establishing a sense of national identity among ancient Jews. David Goodblatt argued that the Bible and related literature served as a key foundation for Jewish nationalism during the Second Temple period, underpinning the collective belief in shared descent, history, and cultural unity. The Bible provided a \"national history\" that traced the lineage of the Jewish people through the patriarchal narratives and tribal genealogies, establishing a shared ancestral framework that connected contemporary Jews to their historical forebears and consolidated a sense of shared descent. Moreover, biblical laws, such as male circumcision, Shabbat observance, and dietary prohibitions, became defining cultural markers of Jewish identity, distinguishing Jewish communities from surrounding populations. The Bible also played a key role in preserving Hebrew, which, unlike Phoenician and Edomite, survived even as Aramaic replaced other regional languages. The translation of biblical texts into Greek and Aramaic allowed Jewish culture to be expressed across linguistic boundaries, enabling a translingual Jewish identity while maintaining its cultural coherence.\nSeveral scholars argue that key sections of the Hebrew Bible were deliberately composed during specific historical periods to construct and consolidate a distinct Israelite national consciousness. E. Theodore Mullen, a key proponent of this idea, argued in his first monograph that the \"Deuteronomistic History\"\u2014 including Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings\u2014was composed during the Babylonian captivity to reinforce a threatened Judean identity. In another work, he focused on the Tetrateuch\u2014Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers\u2014arguing that these books were compiled during the Persian era to forge a unified ethnic identity. This material, when combined with Deuteronomy, formed the Pentateuch, and its inclusion in the Deuteronomistic History created what David Noel Freedman termed the \"primary history.\"\nAccording to Adrian Hastings, the study of sacred texts, including the Hebrew Bible, was a foundational element that allowed the Jews\u2014whom he describes as the \"true proto-nation\"\u2014to preserve their national identity during the two millennia following the loss of their political entity in the first century CE. This enduring connection to their heritage enabled Jews to be perceived as a nation rather than merely an ethnic group, ultimately paving the way for the rise of Zionism and the eventual establishment of the State of Israel.\nInfluence on Christianity.\nChristianity has long asserted a close relationship between the Hebrew Bible and New Testament. In Protestant Bibles, the Old Testament is the same as the Hebrew Bible, but the books are arranged differently. Catholic Bibles and Eastern Orthodox Bibles, as well as those in the Oriental Orthodox and Assyrian churches, contain books not included in certain versions of the Hebrew Bible, called Deuterocanonical books. Protestant English Bibles originally included the Deuterocanonical books, which Protestants now include among the Apocrypha. These books were removed when a slimmed-down King James Version was mass-produced by free Bible societies out of cost considerations.\nThe ancient translations of the Hebrew Bible currently used by the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches are based on the Septuagint, which was considered the authoritative scriptural canon by the early Christians. The Septuagint was influential on early Christianity as it was the Hellenistic Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible primarily used by the 1st-century Christian authors.\nAdrian Hastings contended that the model of ancient Israel presented in the Hebrew Bible established the original concept of nationhood, which subsequently influenced the development of nation-states in the Christian world.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "30345", "revid": "105732", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30345", "title": "Talmud", "text": "Central text of Rabbinic Judaism\nThe Talmud (; , 'study' or 'learning') is the central text of Rabbinic Judaism and second in authority only to the Hebrew Bible (), the first five books of which form the Torah. It is a primary source of Jewish law () and Jewish theology. It consists of the part of the Oral Torah compiled in the Mishnah and its commentaries, the Gemara. It records the teachings, opinions and disagreements of thousands of rabbis and Torah scholars\u2014collectively referred to as \"Chazal\"\u2014on a variety of subjects, including \"Halakha\", Jewish ethics, philosophy, customs, history, and folklore among other topics. Until the \"Haskalah\" in the 18th and 19th centuries, the Talmud was the centerpiece of Jewish culture in nearly all communities and foundational to \"all Jewish thought and aspirations\", serving also as \"the guide for the daily life\" of Jews. \n\"Talmud\" is used interchangeably with \"Gemara\". The text is made up of 63 tractates, each covering one subject area. The language of the Talmud is Jewish Babylonian Aramaic. Talmudic tradition emerged and was compiled between the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE and the Arab conquest in the early seventh century. Traditionally, it is thought that the Talmud itself was compiled by Rav Ashi and Ravina II around 500 CE, although it is more likely that this happened in the middle of the sixth century.\nThe word \"Talmud\" commonly refers to the Babylonian Talmud (), not the earlier Jerusalem Talmud (). The Babylonian Talmud is the more extensive of the two and is considered the more important.\nVarious collections of quotes from the Talmud circulate on the Internet and elsewhere, purporting to show that the Talmud promotes immoral practices and regards non-Jews as lesser beings. Some of these quotes are genuine (the Talmud dates from the early Middle Ages), some have been taken out of context in a way that changes their meaning, and many are outright fakes.\nEtymology.\n\"Talmud\" translates as \"instruction, learning\", from the Semitic root \"lmd\", meaning \"teach, study\".\nThe two Talmuds.\nIn antiquity, the two major centres of Jewish scholarship were the Talmudic academies in Syria Palaestina and Babylonia. A Talmud was compiled in each of these regional centres. The earlier of the two compilations took place in Galilee, either in the late fourth or early fifth century, and it came to be known as the Jerusalem Talmud (). Later, and likely some time in the sixth century, the Babylonian Talmud was compiled (). The latter Talmud is usually what is meant when the word \"Talmud\" is used without qualification. Traditions of the Jerusalem Talmud and its sages had a significant influence on the milieu out of which the Babylonian Talmud arose.\nJerusalem Talmud.\nThe Jerusalem Talmud is known by several other names, including the Palestinian Talmud (which is more accurate, given that it was not compiled in Jerusalem), and the Talmud of the Land of Israel ( or ). The Jerusalem Talmud was a written codification of oral tradition that had been circulating for centuries, representing a compilation of the Palestinian rabbis' teachings about and textual analyses of the Mishnah (especially those concerning agricultural laws) found across regional centres of the Land of Israel in the Galilee (principally those of Tiberias, Sepphoris, and Caesarea). It is written largely in Jewish Palestinian Aramaic, a Western Aramaic language that differs from Jewish Babylonian Aramaic, it Babylonian counterpart. The compilation was likely made between the late fourth to the first half of the fifth century.\nDespite its incomplete state, the Jerusalem Talmud remains an indispensable source for the study of the development of \"Halakha\" in the Holy Land. It was also an important primary source for the study of the Babylonian Talmud by the Kairouan school of Chananel ben Chushiel and Nissim ben Jacob, with the result being that opinions ultimately based on the Jerusalem Talmud found their way into the Tosafot and the \"Mishneh Torah\" by Maimonides. Ethical maxims in the Jerusalem Talmud are scattered and interspersed throughout the legal discussions of the several treatises, many of which differ from those in the Babylonian Talmud.\nBabylonian Talmud.\nThe Babylonian Talmud () consists of documents compiled over the period of late antiquity (3rd to 6th centuries). During this period, the most important of the Mesopotamian Jewish centres of learning included the Talmudic academies in Babylonia, such as Nehardea, Nisibis (now Nusaybin), Mahoza (al-Mada'in, south of modern Baghdad), Pumbedita (near present-day al Anbar Governorate), and the Sura Academy, which was probably located about south of Baghdad.\nThe Babylonian Talmud is the culmination of centuries of analysis and dialectic of the Mishnah and Hebrew Bible in the Talmudic academies in Babylonia. According to tradition, the foundations of this process of analysis were laid by Abba Arika (175\u2013247), a disciple of Judah ha-Nasi. Tradition ascribes the compilation of the Babylonian Talmud in its present form to two Babylonian sages, Rav Ashi and Ravina II. Rav Ashi was the president of the Sura Academy from 375 to 427. At this time, he began compiling the Talmud, a written project passed on and completed by Ravina II, the final Amoraic expounder of the Oral Torah. Traditionally, the latest year for the compilation of the Talmud is typically placed at 475, the year Ravina II died. However, even among those who hold traditional views, a final redaction is still thought to have been made by the \"Savoraim\" () in the sixth century.\nComparison.\nUnlike the Western Aramaic dialect of the Jerusalem Talmud, the Babylonian Talmud uses a Babylonian Aramaic dialect. The Jerusalem is also more fragmentary (and difficult to read) due to an incomplete redaction process. Discussions in the Babylonian Talmud are more discursive, rambling, and rely more heavily on anecdote and argumentation by syllogism and Inductive reasoning; those in the Jerusalem Talmud are more factual and apply argumentation through logical deductive reasoning. The Babylonian Talmud is much longer, with about 2.5 million words in total. Proportionally more of the Babylonian material is non-halakhic Aggadah (), constituting a third of its material, compared to a sixth of the Jerusalem. The Babylonian Talmud has received significantly more interest and coverage from commentators. \nMaimonides drew influence from both Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmuds, although he favored the latter over the former when principles between them conflicted. As the Palestinian Jewish community declined in influence and the Babylonian community became the intellectual center of the Jewish diaspora, the Babylonian Talmud became the more widely accepted and popular version. Whereas the Jerusalem Talmud only includes the opinions of Palestinian rabbis (the ), the Babylonian Talmud also includes Babylonian authorities (in addition to later authorities because of its later date). As such, it is regarded as more comprehensive.\nNeither Talmud covers the entire Mishnah. For example, the Babylonian commentary only covers 37 of 63 Mishnaic tractates. In particular:\nStructure.\nThe structure of the Talmud follows that of the Mishnah, divided into Six Orders (known as the \"Shisha Sedarim\", or \"Shas\") of general subject matter are divided into 63 tractates \"(masekhtot\"; singular: \"masekhet)\" of more focused subject compilations, though not all tractates have Gemara. Each tractate is divided into chapters \"(perakim\"; singular: \"perek)\", 517 in total, that are both numbered according to the Hebrew alphabet and given names, usually using the first one or two words in the first Mishnah. A \"perek\" may continue over several (up to tens of) pages. Each \"perek\" will contain several \"mishnayot\".\nMishnah.\nThe Mishnah is a compilation of legal opinions and debates. Statements in the Mishnah are typically terse, recording brief opinions of the rabbis debating a subject; or recording only an unattributed ruling, apparently representing a consensus view. The rabbis recorded in the Mishnah are known as the Tannaim (literally, \"repeaters\", or \"teachers\"). These tannaim\u2014rabbis of the second century CE\u2014\"who produced the Mishnah and other tannaic works, must be distinguished from the rabbis of the third to fifth centuries, known as amoraim (literally, \"speakers\"), who produced the two Talmudim and other amoraic works\".\nSince it sequences its laws by subject matter instead of by biblical context, the Mishnah discusses individual subjects more thoroughly than the Midrash, and it includes a much broader selection of halakhic subjects than the Midrash. The Mishnah's topical organization thus became the framework of the Talmud as a whole. But not every tractate in the Mishnah has a corresponding Gemara. Also, the order of the tractates in the Talmud differs in some cases from that in the \"Mishnah\".\nGemara.\nThe Gemara constitutes the commentary portion of the Talmud. The Mishnah, and its commentary (the Gemara), together constitute the Talmud. This commentary arises from a longstanding tradition of rabbis analyzing, debating, and discussing the Mishnah -\"shakla v'tarya\" - ever since it was compiled. The rabbis who participated in the process that produced this commentarial tradition are known as the Amoraim. Each discussion is presented in a self-contained, edited passage known as a sugya.\nMuch of the Gemara is legal in nature. Each analysis begins with a Mishnaic legal statement. With each sugya, the statement may be analyzed and compared with other statements. This process can be framed as an exchange between two (often anonymous, possibly metaphorical) disputants, termed the ' (questioner) and ' (answerer). Gemara also commonly tries to find the correct biblical basis for a given law in the Mishnah as well as the logical process that connects the biblical to the Mishnaic tradition. This process was known as \"talmud\", long before the \"Talmud\" itself became a text. \nIn addition, the Gemara contains a wide range of narratives, homiletical or exegetical passages, sayings, and other non-legal content, termed aggadah. A story told in a sugya of the Babylonian Talmud may draw upon the Mishnah, the Jerusalem Talmud, midrash, and other sources.\nBaraita.\nThe traditions that the Gemara comments on are not limited to what is found in the Mishnah, but the Baraita as well (a term that broadly designates Oral Torah traditions that did not end up in the Mishnah). The \"baraitot\" cited in the Gemara are often quotations from the Tosefta (a tannaitic compendium of halakha parallel to the Mishnah) and the Midrash halakha (specifically Mekhilta, Sifra and Sifre). Some \"baraitot\", however, are known only through traditions cited in the Gemara, and are not part of any other collection.\nMinor tractates.\nIn addition to the Six Orders, the Talmud contains a series of short treatises of a later date, usually printed at the end of Seder Nezikin. These are not divided into Mishnah and Gemara.\nLanguage.\nThe work is largely in Jewish Babylonian Aramaic, although quotations in the Gemara of the Mishnah, the Baraitas and Tanakh appear in Mishnaic or Biblical Hebrew. Some other dialects of Aramaic occur in quotations of other older works, like the Megillat Taanit. The reason why earlier texts occur in Hebrew, and later texts in Aramaic, is because of the adoption of the latter (which was the spoken vernacular) by rabbinic circles during the period of the Amoraim (rabbis cited in the Gemara) beginning around the year 200. A second Aramaic dialect is used in Nedarim, Nazir, Temurah, Keritot, and Me'ilah; the second is closer in style to the Targum.\nManuscripts.\nThe only complete manuscript of the Talmud, Munich Codex Hebraica 95, dates from 1342 (http://). Other manuscripts of the Talmud include:\nDating.\nPremodern estimates.\nThe Talmud itself (https://) incorporates a statement that \"Ravina and Rav Ashi were the end of instruction\". Likewise, Sherira ben Hanina writes that \"instruction ended\" with the death of Ravina II in 811 SE (500 CE), and \"the Talmud stopped with the end of instruction in the days of Rabbah Jose (fl. 476-514)\". \"Seder Olam Zutta\" records that \"in 811 SE (500 CE) Ravina the End of Instruction died, and the Talmud was stopped\", and the same text is found in Codex Gaster 83. Another medieval chronicle records that \"On Wednesday, 13 Kislev, 811 SE (500 CE), Ravina the End of Instruction son of Rav Huna died, and the Talmud stopped.\" Abraham ibn Daud gives 821 SE (510 CE) for the same event, and Joseph ibn Tzaddik writes that \"Mareimar and Mar bar Rav Assi et al. completed the Babylonian Talmud . . . in 4265 AM (505 CE)\". Nachmanides dated the Talmud's compilation to \"400 years after the Destruction\", which is 470 CE if taken as exact. According to Moses da Rieti, \"Ravina and Rav Ashi compiled the Talmud but they did not complete it, and Mar bar Rav Ashi and Mareimar et al. sealed it in the days of Rabbah Jose . . . he headed the academy for 38 years after succeeding Ravina, until 4274 AM (514 CE), and in his days the Babylonian Talmud was sealed, which was begun and largely redacted in the days of Rav Ashi and Ravina\".\nThe \"Wikkuah\", a description of the 1240 Disputation of Paris, records that Yechiel of Paris claimed that \"the Talmud is 1,500 years old\", which would put it in the 3rd century BCE. Pietro Capelli suggests that it must have been traditional among medieval Ashkenazic Jews to date the Talmud from its beginning instead of its completion. Later manuscripts of the \"Wikkuah\" adopt the usual system of dating it to the time of Ravina II. Nicholas Donin, by contrast, claimed that the Talmud was only composed \"400 years\" before, i.e. around 840 CE. \nModern estimates.\nA wide range of dates have been proposed for the Babylonian Talmud by historians. The text was most likely completed, however, in the 6th century, or prior to the early Muslim conquests in the mid-7th century at the latest, on the basis that the Talmud lacks loanwords or syntax deriving from Arabic. By comparison, Islamic-era rabbinic documents are heavily influenced by Arabic writing, convention, and loanwords, and rabbinic writings came to be exclusively written in Arabic by the 8th century. \nRecently, it has been extensively argued that Talmud is an expression and product of Sasanian culture, as well as other Greek-Roman, Middle Persian, and Syriac sources up to the same period of time. The contents of the text likely trace to this time regardless of the date of the final redaction/compilation. \nAdditional external evidence for a latest possible date for the composition of the Babylonian Talmud are uses of it by external sources such as \"Letter of Baboi\" (c.\u2009813) and chronicles like the \"Seder Tannaim veAmoraim\" (9th century) and the \"Iggeret of Rabbi Sherira Gaon\" (987). As for a lower boundary on the dating of the Babylonian Talmud, it must post-date the early 5th century given its reliance on the Jerusalem Talmud.\nIn Jewish scholarship.\nFrom the time of its completion, the Talmud became integral to Jewish scholarship. A maxim in Pirkei Avot advocates its study from the age of 15.\nRabbi Adin Steinsaltz writes that \"If the Bible is the cornerstone of Judaism, then the Talmud is the central pillar ... No other work has had a comparable influence on the theory and practice of Jewish life, shaping influence on the theory and practice of Jewish life\" and states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Talmud is the repository of thousands of years of Jewish wisdom, and the oral law, which is as ancient and significant as the written law (the Torah) finds expression therein. It is a conglomerate of law, legend, and philosophy, a blend of unique logic and shrewd pragmatism, of history and science, anecdotes and humor... Although its main objective is to interpret and comment on a book of law, it is, simultaneously, a work of art that goes beyond legislation and its practical application. And although the Talmud is, to this day, the primary source of Jewish law, it cannot be cited as an authority for purposes of ruling...\nThough based on the principles of tradition and the transmission of authority from generation to generation, it is unparalleled in its eagerness to question and reexamine convention and accepted views and to root out underlying causes. The talmudic method of discussion and demonstration tries to approximate mathematical precision, but without having recourse to mathematical or logical symbols.\n...the Talmud is the embodiment of the great concept of \"mitzvat talmud Torah\" - the positive religious duty of studying Torah, of acquiring learning and wisdom, study which is its own end and reward.\nThe following subsections outline some of the major areas of Talmudic study.\nLegal interpretation.\nOne area of Talmudic scholarship developed out of the need to ascertain the Halakha (Jewish rabbinical law). Early commentators such as Isaac Alfasi (North Africa, 1013\u20131103) attempted to extract and determine the binding legal opinions from the vast corpus of the Talmud. Alfasi's work was highly influential, attracted several commentaries in its own right and later served as a basis for the creation of halakhic codes. Another influential medieval Halakhic work following the order of the Babylonian Talmud, and to some extent modelled on Alfasi, was \"the \"Mordechai\"\", a compilation by Mordechai ben Hillel (c. 1250\u20131298). A third such work was that of Asher ben Yechiel (d. 1327). All these works and their commentaries are printed in the Vilna and many subsequent editions of the Talmud.\nA 15th-century Spanish rabbi, Jacob ibn Habib (d. 1516), compiled the \"Ein Yaakov\", which extracts nearly all the Aggadic material from the Talmud. It was intended to familiarize the public with the ethical parts of the Talmud and to dispute many of the accusations surrounding its contents.\nCommentaries.\nGeonic-era (6th-11th centuries) commentaries have largely been lost, but are known to exist from partial quotations in later medieval and early modern texts. Because of this, it is known that now-lost commentaries on the Talmud were written by Paltoi Gaon, Sherira, Hai Gaon, and Saadya (though in this case, Saadiya is not likely to be the true author). Of these, the commentary of Paltoi ben Abaye (\"c.\" 840) is the earliest. His son, Zemah ben Paltoi paraphrased and explained the passages which he quoted; and he composed, as an aid to the study of the Talmud, a lexicon which Abraham Zacuto consulted in the fifteenth century. Saadia Gaon is said to have composed commentaries on the Talmud, aside from his Arabic commentaries on the Mishnah.\nThe first surviving commentary on the entire Talmud is that of Chananel ben Chushiel. Many medieval authors also composed commentaries focusing on the content of specific tractates, including Nissim ben Jacob and Gershom ben Judah. The commentary of Rashi, covering most of the Talmud, has become a classic. Sections in the commentary covering a few tractates (Pes, BB and Mak) were completed by his students, especially Judah ben Nathan, and a sections dealing with specific tractates (Ned, Naz, Hor and MQ) of the commentary that appear in some print editions of Rashi's commentary today were not composed by him. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, a genre of rabbinic literature emerged surrounding Rashi's commentary, with the purpose of supplementing it and addressing internal contradictions via the technique of \"pilpul\". This genre of commentary is known as the Tosafot and focuses on specific passages instead of a running continuous commentary across the entire Talmud.\nMany Talmudic passages are difficult to understand, sometimes owing to the use of Greek or Persian loanwords whose meaning had become obscure. A major area of Talmudic scholarship developed to explain these passages and words. Some early commentators such as Rabbenu Gershom of Mainz (10th century) and Rabbenu \u1e24ananel (early 11th century) produced running commentaries to various tractates. These commentaries could be read with the text of the Talmud and would help explain the meaning of the text. Another important work is the \"Sefer ha-Maftea\u1e25\" (Book of the Key) by Nissim Gaon, which contains a preface explaining the different forms of Talmudic argumentation and then explains abbreviated passages in the Talmud by cross-referring to parallel passages where the same thought is expressed in full. Commentaries \"(\u1e25iddushim)\" by Joseph ibn Migash on two tractates, Bava Batra and Shevuot, based on \u1e24ananel and Alfasi, also survive, as does a compilation by Zechariah Aghmati called \"Sefer ha-Ner\".\nThe \"Tosafot\" are collected commentaries by various medieval Ashkenazic rabbis on the Talmud (known as \"Tosafists\" or \"Ba'alei Tosafot\"). One of the main goals of the \"Tosafot\" is to explain and interpret contradictory statements in the Talmud. Unlike Rashi, the \"Tosafot\" is not a running commentary, but rather comments on selected matters. Often the explanations of \"Tosafot\" differ from those of Rashi.\nAmong the founders of the Tosafist school were Rabbeinu Tam, who was a grandson of Rashi, and, Rabbenu Tam's nephew, Isaac ben Samuel. The Tosafot commentaries were collected in different editions in the various schools. The benchmark collection of Tosafot for Northern France was that of Eliezer of Touques. The standard collection for Spain was Rabbenu Asher's \"Tosefot haRosh.\" The Tosafot that are printed in the standard Vilna edition of the Talmud are an edited version compiled from the various medieval collections, predominantly that of Touques.\nOver time, the approach of the Tosafists spread to other Jewish communities, particularly those in Spain. This led to the composition of many other commentaries in similar styles. \nAmong these are the commentaries of Nachmanides (Ramban), Solomon ben Adret (Rashba), Yom Tov of Seville (Ritva) and Nissim of Gerona (Ran); these are often titled \u201c\"Chiddushei\" ...\u201d (\u201cNovellae of ...\u201d).\nA comprehensive anthology consisting of extracts from all these is the \"Shitah Mekubezet\" of Bezalel Ashkenazi.\nOther commentaries produced in Spain and Provence were not influenced by the Tosafist style. Two of the most significant of these are the \"Yad Ramah\" by rabbi Meir Abulafia and \"Bet Habechirah\" by rabbi Menahem haMeiri, commonly referred to as \"Meiri\". While the \"Bet Habechirah\" is extant for all of Talmud, we only have the \"Yad Ramah\" for Tractates Sanhedrin, Baba Batra and Gittin. Like the commentaries of Ramban and the others, these are generally printed as independent works, though some Talmud editions include the \"Shitah Mekubezet\" in an abbreviated form.\nIn later centuries, focus partially shifted from direct Talmudic interpretation to the analysis of previously written Talmudic commentaries. Well known are \"Maharshal\" (Solomon Luria), \"Maharam\" (Meir Lublin) and \"Maharsha\" (Samuel Edels), which analyze Rashi and Tosafot together; other such commentaries include \"Ma'adanei Yom Tov\" by Yom-Tov Lipmann Heller, in turn a commentary on the Rosh (see below), and the glosses by Zvi Hirsch Chajes. These later commentaries are generally appended to the tractate. \nCommentaries discussing the Halachik-legal content - outlined above - include \"Rosh\", \"Rif\" and \"Mordechai\"; these are now standard appendices to each volume. Rambam's \"Mishneh Torah\" is invariably studied alongside these three; although a code, and therefore not in the same order as the Talmud, the relevant location is identified via the \"Ein Mishpat\", following.\nFound in almost all editions of the Talmud, is the \"study-aid\" consisting of the marginal notes \"Torah Or\", \"Ein Mishpat Ner Mitzvah\" and \"Masoret ha-Shas\" by the Italian rabbi Joshua Boaz, which give references respectively: to the cited Biblical passages, to the relevant halachic codes \"(Mishneh Torah\", \"Tur\", \"Shulchan Aruch\", and \"Se'mag)\" and to related Talmudic passages.\nMost editions of the Talmud include also the brief marginal notes by Akiva Eger under the name \"Gilyon ha-Shas\", and textual notes by Joel Sirkes and the Vilna Gaon.\nPilpul.\nDuring the 15th and 16th centuries, a new intensive form of Talmud study arose. Complicated logical arguments were used to explain minor points of contradiction within the Talmud. The term \"pilpul\" was applied to this type of study. Usage of \"pilpul\" in this sense (that of \"sharp analysis\") harks back to the Talmudic era and refers to the intellectual sharpness this method demanded.\nPilpul practitioners posited that the Talmud could contain no redundancy or contradiction whatsoever. New categories and distinctions \"(hillukim)\" were therefore created, resolving seeming contradictions within the Talmud by novel logical means.\nIn the Ashkenazi world the founders of \"pilpul\" are generally considered to be Jacob Pollak (1460\u20131541) and Shalom Shachna. This kind of study reached its height in the 16th and 17th centuries when expertise in pilpulistic analysis was considered an art form and became a goal in and of itself within the yeshivot of Poland and Lithuania. But the popular new method of Talmud study was not without critics; already in the 15th century, the ethical tract \"Orhot Zaddikim\" (\"Paths of the Righteous\" in Hebrew) criticized pilpul for an overemphasis on intellectual acuity. Many 16th- and 17th-century rabbis were also critical of pilpul. Among them are Judah Loew ben Bezalel (the \"Maharal\" of Prague), Isaiah Horowitz, and Yair Bacharach.\nBy the 18th century, pilpul study waned. Other styles of learning such as that of the school of Elijah b. Solomon, the Vilna Gaon, became popular. The term \"pilpul\" was increasingly applied derogatorily to novellae deemed casuistic and hairsplitting. Authors referred to their own commentaries as \"al derekh ha-peshat\" (by the simple method) to contrast them with pilpul.\nSephardic approaches.\nAmong Sephardi and Italian Jews from the 15th century on, some authorities sought to apply the methods of Aristotelian logic, as reformulated by Averroes. This method was first recorded, though without explicit reference to Aristotle, by Isaac Campanton (d. Spain, 1463) in his \"Darkhei ha-Talmud\" (\"The Ways of the Talmud\"), and is also found in the works of Moses Chaim Luzzatto.\nAccording to the present-day Sephardi scholar Jos\u00e9 Faur, traditional Sephardic Talmud study could take place on any of three levels.\nBrisker method.\nIn the late 19th century another trend in Talmud study arose. Hayyim Soloveitchik (1853\u20131918) of Brisk (Brest-Litovsk) developed and refined this style of study. Brisker method involves a reductionistic analysis of rabbinic arguments within the Talmud or among the Rishonim, explaining the differing opinions by placing them within a categorical structure. The Brisker method is highly analytical and is often criticized as being a modern-day version of pilpul. Nevertheless, the influence of the Brisker method is great. Most modern-day Yeshivot study the Talmud using the Brisker method in some form. One feature of this method is the use of Maimonides' \"Mishneh Torah\" as a guide to Talmudic interpretation, as distinct from its use as a source of practical \"halakha\".\nRival methods were those of the Mir and Telz yeshivas.\nSee and .\nTextual criticism.\nMedieval era.\nThe text of the Talmud has been subject to some level of critical scrutiny throughout its history. Rabbinic tradition holds that the people cited in both Talmuds did not have a hand in its writings; rather, their teachings were edited into a rough form around 450 CE (Talmud Yerushalmi) and 550 CE (Talmud Bavli.) The text of the Bavli especially was not firmly fixed at that time.\nGaonic responsa literature addresses this issue. Teshuvot Geonim Kadmonim, section 78, deals with mistaken biblical readings in the Talmud. This Gaonic responsum states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... But you must examine carefully in every case when you feel uncertainty [as to the credibility of the text] \u2013 what is its source? Whether a scribal error? Or the superficiality of a second rate student who was not well versed?...after the manner of many mistakes found among those superficial second-rate students, and certainly among those rural memorizers who were not familiar with the biblical text. And since they erred in the first place... [they compounded the error.]\u2014\u200a\nIn the early medieval era, Rashi already concluded that some statements in the extant text of the Talmud were insertions from later editors. On Shevuot 3b Rashi writes \"A mistaken student wrote this in the margin of the Talmud, and copyists [subsequently] put it into the Gemara.\"\nEarly modern era.\nThe emendations of Yoel Sirkis and the Vilna Gaon are included in all standard editions of the Talmud, in the form of marginal glosses entitled \"Hagahot ha-Bach\" and \"Hagahot ha-Gra\" respectively; further emendations by Solomon Luria are set out in commentary form at the back of each tractate. The Vilna Gaon's emendations were often based on his quest for internal consistency in the text rather than on manuscript evidence; nevertheless many of the Gaon's emendations were later verified by textual critics, such as Solomon Schechter, who had Cairo Genizah texts with which to compare our standard editions.\nContemporary scholarship.\nIn the 19th century, Raphael Nathan Nota Rabinovicz published a multi-volume work entitled \"Dikdukei Soferim\", showing textual variants from the Munich and other early manuscripts of the Talmud, and further variants are recorded in the Complete Israeli Talmud and \"Gemara Shelemah\" editions (see Critical editions, above).\nToday many more manuscripts have become available, in particular from the Cairo Geniza. The Academy of the Hebrew Language has prepared a text on CD-ROM for lexicographical purposes, containing the text of each tractate according to the manuscript it considers most reliable, and images of some of the older manuscripts may be found on the website of the National Library of Israel (formerly the Jewish National and University Library). The NLI, the Lieberman Institute (associated with the Jewish Theological Seminary of America), the Institute for the Complete Israeli Talmud (part of Yad Harav Herzog) and the Friedberg Jewish Manuscript Society all maintain searchable websites on which the viewer can request variant manuscript readings of a given passage.\nSome trends within contemporary Talmud scholarship are listed below.\nTranslations.\nThere are six contemporary translations of the Talmud into English:\nIndex.\n\"A widely accepted and accessible index\" was the goal driving several such projects.:\nEditions.\nBomberg Talmud 1523.\nThe first complete edition of the Babylonian Talmud was printed in Venice by Daniel Bomberg 1520\u201323 with the support of Pope Leo X. In addition to the \"Mishnah\" and \"Gemara\", Bomberg's edition contained the commentaries of Rashi and Tosafot. Almost all printings since Bomberg have followed the same pagination. Bomberg's edition was considered relatively free of censorship.\nFroben Talmud 1578.\nAmbrosius Frobenius collaborated with the scholar Israel Ben Daniel Sifroni from Italy. His most extensive work was a Talmud edition published, with great difficulty, in 1578\u201381.\nBenveniste Talmud 1645.\nFollowing Ambrosius Frobenius's publication of most of the Talmud in installments in Basel, Immanuel Benveniste published the whole Talmud in installments in Amsterdam 1644\u20131648, Although according to Raphael Rabbinovicz the Benveniste Talmud may have been based on the Lublin Talmud and included many of the censors' errors. \"It is noteworthy due to the inclusion of \"Avodah Zarah\", omitted due to Church censorship from several previous editions, and when printed, often lacking a title page.\nSlavita Talmud 1795 and Vilna Talmud 1835.\nThe edition of the Talmud published by the Szapira brothers in Slavita was published in 1817, and it is particularly prized by many rebbes of Hasidic Judaism. In 1835, after a religious community copyright was nearly over, and following an acrimonious dispute with the Szapira family, a new edition of the Talmud was printed by Menachem Romm of Vilna.\nKnown as the \"Vilna Edition Shas\", this edition (and later ones printed by his widow and sons, the Romm publishing house) has been used in the production of more recent editions of Talmud Bavli.\nA page number in the Vilna Talmud refers to a double-sided page, known as a \"daf\", or folio in English; each daf has two \"amudim\" labeled and , sides A and B (recto and verso). The convention of referencing by \"daf\" is relatively recent and dates from the early Talmud printings of the 17th century, though the actual pagination goes back to the Bomberg edition. Earlier rabbinic literature generally refers to the tractate or chapters within a tractate (e.g. Berachot Chapter 1, ). It sometimes also refers to the specific Mishnah in that chapter, where \"Mishnah\" is replaced with \"Halakha\", here meaning route, to \"direct\" the reader to the entry in the Gemara corresponding to that Mishna (e.g. Berachot Chapter 1 Halakha 1, , would refer to the first Mishnah of the first chapter in Tractate Berachot, and its corresponding entry in the Gemara). However, this form is nowadays more commonly (though not exclusively) used when referring to the Jerusalem Talmud. Nowadays, reference is usually made in format [\"Tractate daf a/b\"] (e.g. Berachot 23b, ). Increasingly, the symbols \".\" and \":\" are used to indicate Recto and Verso, respectively (thus, e.g. Berachot 23:, ). These references always refer to the pagination of the Vilna Talmud.\nCritical editions.\nThe text of the Vilna editions is considered by scholars not to be uniformly reliable, and there have been a number of attempts to collate textual variants.\nThere have been critical editions of particular tractates (e.g., Henry Malter's edition of \"Ta'anit\"), but there is no modern critical edition of the whole Talmud. Modern editions such as those of the Oz ve-Hadar Institute correct misprints and restore passages that in earlier editions were modified or excised by censorship but do not attempt a comprehensive account of textual variants. One edition, by Yosef Amar, represents the Yemenite tradition, and takes the form of a photostatic reproduction of a Vilna-based print to which Yemenite vocalization and textual variants have been added by hand, together with printed introductory material. Collations of the Yemenite manuscripts of some tractates have been published by Columbia University.\nEditions for a wider audience.\nA number of editions have been aimed at bringing the Talmud to a wider audience. Aside from the Steinsaltz and Artscroll/Schottenstein sets there are:\nOther notable editions.\nLazarus Goldschmidt published an edition from the \"uncensored text\" of the Babylonian Talmud with a German translation in 9 volumes (commenced Leipzig, 1897\u20131909, edition completed, following emigration to England in 1933, by 1936).\nTwelve volumes of the Babylonian Talmud were published by Mir Yeshiva refugees during the years 1942 thru 1946 while they were in Shanghai. The major tractates, one per volume, were: \"Shabbat, Eruvin, Pesachim, Gittin, Kiddushin, Nazir, Sotah, Bava Kama, Sanhedrin, Makot, Shevuot, Avodah Zara\" (with some volumes having, in addition, \"Minor Tractates\").\nA Survivors' Talmud was published, encouraged by President Truman's \"responsibility toward these victims of persecution\" statement. The U.S. Army (despite \"the acute shortage of paper in Germany\") agreed to print \"fifty copies of the Talmud, packaged into 16-volume sets\" during 1947\u20131950. The plan was extended: 3,000 copies, in 19-volume sets.\nIn visual arts.\nIn Carl Schleicher's paintings.\nRabbis and Talmudists studying and debating Talmud abound in the art of Austrian painter Carl Schleicher (1825\u20131903); active in Vienna, especially c.\u20091859\u20131871.\nReception outside of Judaism.\nChristianity.\nThe study of Talmud is not restricted to those of the Jewish religion and has attracted interest in other cultures. Christian scholars have long expressed an interest in the study of Talmud, which has helped illuminate their own scriptures. Talmud contains biblical exegesis and commentary on Tanakh that will often clarify elliptical and esoteric passages. The Talmud contains possible references to Jesus and his disciples, while the Christian canon makes mention of Talmudic figures and contains teachings that can be paralleled within the Talmud and Midrash. The Talmud provides cultural and historical context to the Gospel and the writings of the Apostles.\nSouth Korea.\nSouth Koreans reportedly hope to emulate Jews' high academic standards by studying Jewish literature. Almost every household has a translated copy of a book they call \"Talmud\", which parents read to their children, and the book is part of the primary-school curriculum. The \"Talmud\" in this case is usually one of several possible volumes, the earliest translated into Korean from the Japanese. The original Japanese books were created through the collaboration of Japanese writer Hideaki Kase and Marvin Tokayer, an Orthodox American rabbi serving in Japan in the 1960s and 70s. The first collaborative book was \"5,000 Years of Jewish Wisdom: Secrets of the Talmud Scriptures\", created over a three-day period in 1968 and published in 1971. The book contains actual stories from the Talmud, proverbs, ethics, Jewish legal material, biographies of Talmudic rabbis, and personal stories about Tokayer and his family. Tokayer and Kase published a number of other books on Jewish themes together in Japanese.\nThe first South Korean publication of \"5,000 Years of Jewish Wisdom\" was in 1974, by Tae Zang publishing house. Many different editions followed in both Korea and China, often by black-market publishers. Between 2007 and 2009, Yong-soo Hyun of the Shema Yisrael Educational Institute published a 6-volume edition of the Korean Talmud, bringing together material from a variety of Tokayer's earlier books. He worked with Tokayer to correct errors and Tokayer is listed as the author. Tutoring centers based on this and other works called \"Talmud\" for both adults and children are popular in Korea and \"Talmud\" books (all based on Tokayer's works and not the original Talmud) are widely read and known.\nIran.\nIn 2012, then-Vice President of Iran, Mohammad Reza Rahimi, claimed that the Talmud was the cause of the spread of narcotics in the country.\nCriticism.\nHistorian Michael Levi Rodkinson, in his book \"The History of the Talmud\", wrote that detractors of the Talmud, both during and subsequent to its formation, \"have varied in their character, objects and actions\" and the book documents a number of critics and persecutors, including Nicholas Donin, Johannes Pfefferkorn, Johann Andreas Eisenmenger, the Frankists, and August Rohling. Many of the attacks come from antisemitic sources such as in modern times Justinas Pranaitis, Elizabeth Dilling, and David Duke. Criticisms also arise from Christian, Muslim, and Jewish sources, as well as from atheists and skeptics. \nAccusations against the Talmud, particularly those from antisemitic sources, include alleged:\nScholars point out that many of these criticisms are either outright falsehoods or based on quotations that are misrepresented or taken out of context, and that some critics misrepresent the meaning of the Talmud's text and its basic character as a detailed record of discussions that preserved statements by a variety of sages, from which statements and opinions that were rejected were never edited out.\nMiddle Ages.\nAt the very time that the Babylonian \"savoraim\" put the finishing touches to the redaction of the Talmud, the emperor Justinian issued his edict against \"deuterosis\" (doubling, repetition) of the Hebrew Bible. It is disputed whether, in this context, \"deuterosis\" means \"Mishnah\" or \"Targum\": in patristic literature, the word is used in both senses.\nFull-scale attacks on the Talmud took place in the 13th century in France, where Talmudic study was then flourishing. In the 1230s Nicholas Donin, a Jewish convert to Christianity, pressed 35 charges against the Talmud to Pope Gregory IX by translating a series of allegedly blasphemous passages about Jesus, Mary or Christianity. There is a quoted Talmudic passage, for example, where a person named Yeshu who some people have claimed is Jesus of Nazareth is sent to Gehenna to be boiled in excrement for eternity. Donin also selected an injunction of the Talmud that permits Jews to kill non-Jews. This led to the Disputation of Paris, which took place in 1240 at the court of Louis IX of France, where four rabbis, including Yechiel of Paris and Moses ben Jacob of Coucy, defended the Talmud against the accusations of Nicholas Donin. The translation of the Talmud from Aramaic to non-Jewish languages stripped Jewish discourse from its covering, something that was resented by Jews as a profound violation. The Disputation of Paris led to the condemnation and the first burning of copies of the Talmud in Paris in 1242. The burning of copies of the Talmud continued.\nThe Talmud was likewise the subject of the Disputation of Barcelona in 1263 between Nahmanides and Pablo Christiani, a Jewish convert to Christianity, in which they argued whether Jesus was the messiah prophesized in Judaism. This same Pablo Christiani made an attack on the Talmud that resulted in a papal bull against the Talmud and in the first censorship, which was undertaken at Barcelona by a commission of Dominicans, who ordered the cancellation of passages deemed objectionable from a Christian perspective (1264).\nAt the Disputation of Tortosa in 1413, Geronimo de Santa F\u00e9 brought forward a number of accusations, including the fateful assertion that the condemnations of \"pagans\", \"heathens\", and \"apostates\" found in the Talmud were, in reality, veiled references to Christians. These assertions were denied by the Jewish community and its scholars, who contended that Judaic thought made a sharp distinction between those classified as heathen or pagan, being polytheistic, and those who acknowledge one true God (such as the Christians) even while worshipping the true monotheistic God incorrectly. Thus, Jews viewed Christians as misguided and in error, but not among the \"heathens\" or \"pagans\" discussed in the Talmud.\nBoth Pablo Christiani and Geronimo de Santa F\u00e9, in addition to criticizing the Talmud, also regarded it as a source of authentic traditions, some of which could be used as arguments in favor of Christianity. Examples of such traditions were statements that the Messiah was born around the time of the destruction of the Temple and that the Messiah sat at the right hand of God.\nIn 1415, Antipope Benedict XIII, who had convened the Tortosa disputation, issued a papal bull (which was destined, however, to remain inoperative) forbidding the Jews to read the Talmud, and ordering the destruction of all copies of it. Far more important were the charges made in the early part of the 16th century by the convert Johannes Pfefferkorn, the agent of the Dominicans. The result of these accusations was a struggle in which the emperor and the pope acted as judges, the advocate of the Jews being Johann Reuchlin, who was opposed by the obscurantists; and this controversy, which was carried on for the most part by means of pamphlets, became in the eyes of some a precursor of the Reformation.\nRenaissance.\nAn unexpected result of this affair was the complete printed edition of the Babylonian Talmud issued in 1520 by Daniel Bomberg at Venice, under the protection of a papal privilege. Three years later, in 1523, Bomberg published the first edition of the Jerusalem Talmud. In 1553, during the heightened tensions of the Counter-Reformation and following the Bragadin-Giustiniani dispute, new attacks were made again the Talmud and the Roman Inquisition advocated the burning of the Talmud. The primary reason was not that the Talmud contained alleged blasphemies but that the Inquisition saw the Talmud as an obstacle in the conversion of Jews to Christianity. Thus, on the New Year, Rosh Hashanah (September 9, 1553) the copies of the Talmud confiscated by a decree of the Inquisition and burned in Campo de' Fiori in Rome. Other burnings took place in other Italian cities, such as the one instigated by Joshua dei Cantori at Cremona in 1559. \nCensorship of the Talmud and other Hebrew works was introduced by a papal bull issued in 1554; five years later the Talmud was included in the first Index Expurgatorius. In 1564, Pope Pius IV abolished the prohibition against the Talmud, but decreed that it would need to be censored and could not have Talmud written on its title page. The convention of referring to the work as \"Shas\" \"(shishah sidre Mishnah)\" instead of \"Talmud\" dates from this time.\nThe first edition of the expurgated Talmud, on which most subsequent editions were based, appeared at Basel (1578\u20131581) with the omission of the entire treatise of 'Abodah Zarah and of passages considered inimical to Christianity, together with modifications of certain phrases. In 1581, however, Pope Gregory XIII ordered the confiscation of all Hebrew books including the Talmud and though his successor Sixtus V renounced this policy and preparations were made for a new edition of the Talmud, the successor of Sixtus V, Clement VIII Clement VIII renewed in his bull \"Cum hebraeorum malitia\" the 1557 ban on all Hebrew books except the Bible. The increasing study of the Talmud in Poland led to the issue of a complete edition (Krak\u00f3w, 1602\u201305), with a restoration of the original text; an edition containing, so far as known, only two treatises had previously been published at Lublin (1559\u201376). After an attack on the Talmud took place in Poland (in what is now Ukrainian territory) in 1757, when Bishop Dembowski, at the instigation of the Frankists, convened a public disputation at Kamieniec Podolski, and ordered all copies of the work found in his bishopric to be confiscated and burned. A \"1735 edition of Moed Katan, printed in Frankfurt am Oder\" is among those that survived from that era. \"Situated on the Oder River, Three separate editions of the Talmud were printed there between 1697 and 1739.\"\nThe external history of the Talmud includes also the literary attacks made upon it by some Christian theologians after the Reformation since these onslaughts on Judaism were directed primarily against that work, the leading example being Eisenmenger's \"Entdecktes Judenthum\" (Judaism Unmasked) (1700). In contrast, the Talmud was a subject of rather more sympathetic study by many Christian theologians, jurists and Orientalists from the Renaissance on, including Johann Reuchlin, John Selden, Petrus Cunaeus, John Lightfoot and Johannes Buxtorf father and son. The Flemish scholar Andreas Masius considered that the attack on the Talmud and Hebrew literature would result in greatest damage to Christianity and that a certain knowledge of rabbinic literature was necessary for Christian studies.\n19th century and after.\nThe Vilna edition of the Talmud was subject to Russian government censorship, or self-censorship to meet government expectations, though this was less severe than some previous attempts: the title \"Talmud\" was retained and the tractate Avodah Zarah was included. Most modern editions are either copies of or closely based on the Vilna edition, and therefore still omit most of the disputed passages. Although they were not available for many generations, the removed sections of the Talmud, Rashi, Tosafot and Maharsha were preserved through rare printings of lists of \"errata\", known as \"Chesronos Hashas\" (\"Omissions of the Talmud\"). Many of these censored portions were recovered from uncensored manuscripts in the Vatican Library. Some modern editions of the Talmud contain some or all of this material, either at the back of the book, in the margin, or in its original location in the text.\nIn 1830, during a debate in the French Chamber of Peers regarding state recognition of the Jewish faith, Admiral Verhuell declared himself unable to forgive the Jews whom he had met during his travels throughout the world either for their refusal to recognize Jesus as the Messiah or for their possession of the Talmud. In the same year the Abb\u00e9 Chiarini published a voluminous work entitled \"Th\u00e9orie du Juda\u00efsme\", in which he announced a translation of the Talmud, advocating for the first time a version that would make the work generally accessible, and thus serve for attacks on Judaism: only two out of the projected six volumes of this translation appeared. In a like spirit 19th-century antisemitic agitators often urged that a translation be made; and this demand was even brought before legislative bodies, as in Vienna. The Talmud and the \"Talmud Jew\" thus became objects of antisemitic attacks, for example in August Rohling's \"Der Talmudjude\" (1871), although, on the other hand, they were defended by many Christian students of the Talmud, notably Hermann Strack.\nFurther attacks from antisemitic sources include Justinas Pranaitis' \"The Talmud Unmasked: The Secret Rabbinical Teachings Concerning Christians\" (1892) and Elizabeth Dilling's \"The Plot Against Christianity\" (1964). The criticisms of the Talmud in many modern pamphlets and websites are often recognizable as verbatim quotations from one or other of these.\nHistorians Will and Ariel Durant noted a lack of consistency between the many authors of the Talmud, with some tractates in the wrong order, or subjects dropped and resumed without reason. According to the Durants, the Talmud \"is not the product of deliberation, it is the deliberation itself.\"\nContemporary accusations.\nThe Internet is another source of criticism of the Talmud. The Anti-Defamation League's report on this topic states that antisemitic critics of the Talmud frequently use erroneous translations or selective quotations in order to distort the meaning of the Talmud's text, and sometimes fabricate passages. In addition, the critics rarely provide the full context of the quotations and fail to provide contextual information about the culture that the Talmud was composed in, nearly 2,000 years ago.\nOne such example concerns the line: \"If a Jew be called upon to explain any part of the rabbinic books, he ought to give only a false explanation. One who transgresses this commandment will be put to death.\" This is alleged to be a quote from a book titled \"Libbre David\" (alternatively \"Livore David\"\u200a). No such book exists in the Talmud or elsewhere. The title is assumed to be a corruption of \"Dibre David\", a work published in 1671. Reference to the quote is found in an early Holocaust denial book, \"The Six Million Reconsidered\" by William Grimstad.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLogic and methodology.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nModern scholarly works.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOn individual tractates\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistorical study\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Presented as a parody of the complicated RPG systems which were prevalent at the time while still being a playable game in its own right, its simple structure and humorous nature gave it unexpected popularity. \nDescription.\n\"TWERPS\", (The World's Easiest Role-Playing System), is a humorous universal system of minimalist rules. Characters have only one ability, Strength. Rules sections cover Strength, Combat, and \"How to Do Everything.\" The game includes a sample character sheet, a combat hex sheet, cardstock miniatures, and an introductory micro-mini-scenario.\nThe actual rules of the game are indeed extremely simple. Characters are defined by a single attribute, \"Strength\", which is used for determining all traditional role-playing elements, such as whether or not the character successfully hits in combat, how fast they can move and how much damage they can take before dying. A de facto skill system exists in the form of \"character classes\" which give numerical bonuses to certain activities if their role called for it (for instance, a pilot having a +1 modifier on their roll to fly an aircraft).\nPublication history.\n\"TWERPS\" was originally created, written and illustrated (in a distinctive cartoony style) by \"Jeff &amp; 'Manda Dee\", Jeff Dee being a noted game illustrator and co-writer of \"Villains and Vigilantes\". It was published by Reindeer Games in 1987 as a digest-sized 8-page pamphlet, with four cardstock sheets.\nFirst Edition titles.\nOriginally each installment of the \"TWERPS\" system was sold in a small plastic bag containing an 8-page leaflet, a sheet of cardstock counters to be cut apart, little cardstock hex-maps and a tiny ten-sided die, each being a downsized imitation of elements often found in larger, more elaborate games. The initial run of titles was printed at low cost with black ink on various colored papers to distinguish the various titles (the main rules were on pink paper, the kung-fu rules were on yellow, and so on).\nSecond Edition titles.\nAs the game grew in popularity, the supplements were re-printed in expanded form with more pages and multi-color printing. New supplements covering new genres and specific objects of parody were also added. These expansions and later supplements were mainly written by Norman F. Morin Jr., Brian Rayburn, Jon Hancock and Niels Erickson rather than Jeff &amp; 'Manda Dee. The tone of these second edition titles was noticeably one of more overt humor and silliness, peppering the text with puns (and even calling on fans to mail in suggested puns of their own for future supplements).\nReception.\nStewart Wieck reviewed the product in the December 1986 to January 1987 issue of \"White Wolf\". He downplayed generic role-playing games in general but noted this product was inexpensive, which was part of the appeal of these systems.\nGame critic Rick Swan reviewed the game twice: \nEric Jacobson reviewed \"TWERPS Basic Rules\" in \"White Wolf\" #47 (Sept., 1994), rating it a 4 out of 5 and stated that \"For [the price] you can't lose. Releasing a horde of additional, inexpensive support books, Gamescience offers access to almost every gaming genre. For such a simple little game, it's amazing what you can do.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "30351", "revid": "698799", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30351", "title": "The Modern Lovers", "text": "American rock group\nThe Modern Lovers were an American rock band formed in Natick, Massachusetts in 1970 by Jonathan Richman. The original band existed from 1970 to 1974 but their recordings were not released until 1976 or later. It featured Richman and bassist Ernie Brooks with drummer David Robinson (later of the Cars) and keyboardist Jerry Harrison (later of Talking Heads). The sound of the band owed a great deal to the influence of the Velvet Underground and the Stooges, and is now sometimes classified as \"proto-punk\". It pointed the way towards much of the punk rock, new wave, alternative and indie rock music of later decades. Their debut studio album, the eponymous \"The Modern Lovers\" contained idiosyncratic songs about dating awkwardness, growing up in Massachusetts, love of life, and the USA. The band would also release another studio album, \"The Original Modern Lovers\", and three live albums.\nLater, between 1976 and 1988, Richman used the name \"Modern Lovers\" for a variety of backing bands, always billed as \"Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers\". These bands were quieter and featured more low-key, often near-childlike songs as Richman drew on folk-rock and other genres. This incarnation of the band released 7 studio albums and one live album. Of Richman's original bandmates, only Robinson was part of any of the other Modern Lovers incarnations, and he left the band's second incarnation that same year it formed. Notable members of the second incarnation include producer Andy Paley (who worked with acts such as Brian Wilson with The Beach Boys and Jerry Lee Lewis) and filmmaker Beth Harrington.\nThe original Modern Lovers, 1970\u20131974.\nRichman grew up in Natick, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston, and began playing guitar and writing songs in his mid-teens, first performing solo in public in 1967. He became enamored of the Velvet Underground while he was still in high school, and after graduating in 1969, he moved to New York City where he became personally acquainted with the band and on one occasion opened the bill for them. Richman spent a couple of weeks sleeping on Velvets\u2019 manager Steve Sesnick's sofa before moving into the Hotel Albert, a residence known for its poor conditions.\nAfter nine months in New York, and a trip to Europe and Israel, Richman moved back to his native Boston. With his childhood friend, guitarist John Felice, he organized a band modeled after the Velvets. They quickly recruited drummer David Robinson and bass player Rolfe Anderson, and christened themselves \"the Modern Lovers\". They played their first date, supporting Andy Paley\u2019s band the Sidewinders, in September 1970, barely a month after Richman's return. By this time their setlist already included such noted Richman songs as \"Roadrunner\", \"She Cracked\" and \"Hospital\". Richman's unique character was immediately apparent; he wore short hair and often performed wearing a jacket and tie, and frequently improvised new lyrics and monologues.\nIn early 1971 Anderson and Felice departed; they were replaced by Harvard students bassist Ernie Brooks, and keyboardist Jerry Harrison, completing the classic lineup of the Modern Lovers. This new configuration became very popular in the Boston area, and by the fall of 1971, enthusiastic word-of-mouth led to the Modern Lovers' first exposure to a major label when Stuart Love of Warner Bros. Records contacted them and organized the band's first multi-track session at Intermedia Studio in Boston. The demo produced from this session, and the group's live performances, generated more attention from the industry, including rave reviews from critic Lillian Roxon, and soon A&amp;M Records was interested in the band as well.\nIn April 1972, the Modern Lovers traveled to Los Angeles where they held two demo sessions: the first was produced by the Velvet Underground's John Cale for Warner Bros. while the second was produced by Allan Mason for A&amp;M. These sessions were later used on the band's debut album. While in California the band also performed live, and one gig at the Long Branch Saloon in Berkeley was later issued as a live album. Producer Kim Fowley courted the band, traveling to Boston to produce some poor-quality demos in June 1972. Felice rejoined the group for a few months after his graduation, and the band moved together to live in Cohasset, Massachusetts.\nThe Modern Lovers continued to be a popular live attraction, and on New Year's Eve 1972 supported the New York Dolls at the Mercer Arts Center on a bill which also included Suicide and Wayne County. Early in 1973 they were finally signed by Warner Brothers. However, before returning to the studio in Los Angeles to work with Cale, the group accepted an offer to play a residency at the Inverurie Hotel in Bermuda, owned by the family of a friend of Ernie Brooks. While there, Richman heard and became strongly influenced by the laid-back style of the local musicians, as documented in his later song \"Monologue About Bermuda\". There were also growing personality clashes among band members.\nAlthough on the band's return Richman agreed to record his earlier songs, he was anxious to move in a different musical direction. He wanted to scrap all of the tracks they had recorded and start over with a mellower, more lyrical sound. The rest of the band, while not opposed to such a shift later, insisted that they record as they sounded now. However, the sessions with Cale in September 1973 also coincided with the death of their friend Gram Parsons (a former Harvard student, like Harrison and Brooks), and produced no usable recordings. The record company then recruited Kim Fowley to produce more sessions with the band, this time at Gold Star Studios, with better results. Recordings from these sessions with Fowley were later released in 1981 on an album titled \"The Original Modern Lovers\" (reissued on CD by Bomp Records in 2000).\nBreak-up and release of first album.\nFollowing the failure to complete a debut album, Warner Brothers withdrew their support for the Modern Lovers, and Robinson left the band. They continued to perform live for a few months with new drummer Bob Turner, but Richman was increasingly unwilling to perform his old (although still unreleased) songs such as \"Roadrunner\", and after a final disagreement between him and Harrison over musical style the band split up in February 1974.\nDespite the original group's premature break-up, many of its members found considerable success elsewhere: founding member John Felice formed the Real Kids, Jerry Harrison later joined Talking Heads, David Robinson co-founded the Cars, and Ernie Brooks would later work with David Johansen, Arthur Russell, Elliott Murphy, and Gary Lucas.\nRichman continued recording on his own, eventually moving to California in 1975 to begin working with Beserkley Records whose boss Matthew King Kaufman had met Richman when he worked with A&amp;M. While Richman never returned to the Velvets-inspired sound of the original Modern Lovers, the demo recordings made with that group eventually surfaced in various formats. The first of these releases came in 1976 when Beserkley compiled a posthumous LP from the first two demo sessions produced by Cale and Mason; issued on Beserkley's Home of the Hits subsidiary, the album was simply titled \"The Modern Lovers\" and included celebrated tracks such as \"Roadrunner\", \"She Cracked\", and \"Pablo Picasso\".\nRichman did not recognize this compilation as his \"first album,\" preferring to recognize his debut as 1976's \"Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers,\" an album pursuing the lighter, softer direction he had in mind with a completely different band (the two collections were released within months of each other). However, \"The Modern Lovers\" was given an enthusiastic critical reception, with critic Ira Robbins hailing it as \"one of the truly great art rock albums of all time\", and it influenced numerous aspiring punk rock musicians on both sides of the Atlantic, including the Sex Pistols (who covered \"Roadrunner\" on \"The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle\").\nJonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers, 1976\u20131988.\nIn early 1976, Richman put together a new version of the Modern Lovers, with Leroy Radcliffe (guitar), Greg 'Curly' Keranen (bass) and the returning David Robinson (drums). Keranen had previously played with the Rubinoos, and Radcliffe with Woody's Truckstop. They recorded the album \"Jonathan Richman &amp; The Modern Lovers\" (1976), but Robinson again left after Richman persisted in reducing the size and volume of his drum kit, and was replaced by D. Sharpe. This band recorded the album \"Rock 'n' Roll with the Modern Lovers\" (1977) and toured until Keranen left to go to college and was replaced by Asa Brebner, who played on the albums \"The Modern Lovers Live\" (1978) and \"Back in Your Life\" (1979). David \"D.\" Sharpe died in 1987, aged 39.\nIn 1980 Richman again formed a new Modern Lovers, with Keranen, drummer Michael Guardabascio and backing singers Ellie Marshall and Beth Harrington. They recorded the album \"Jonathan Sings!\" in 1981/82, but it was not released until 1983. The group toured to support the album, often regarded as one of Richman's best, but split up after Keranen again left in 1984.\nThe final incarnation of the Modern Lovers, with Andy Paley, Brennan Totten and (initially) Asa Brebner again, toured and recorded between 1985 and 1988. Richman finally retired the Modern Lovers name after the album \"Modern Lovers 88\".\nRichman continues to perform, often solo and preferring acoustic instruments, and currently has no plans to undertake another group like his original band. A tribute album consisting primarily of Modern Lovers songs, \"If I Were a Richman: a Tribute to the Music of Jonathan Richman\", was released by Wampus Multimedia in 2001. Asa Brebner died in 2019, aged 65.\nInfluence.\nThe Modern Lovers had significant influence on the then-burgeoning punk rock and later new wave and indie musical styles, as viewed in the feature-length 2015 documentary \"Danny Says\".\nJohn Cale, Iggy Pop and David Bowie have all covered \"Pablo Picasso\"; it was also covered by Los Angeles-area rock band Burning Sensations for the soundtrack of the 1984 Alex Cox film \"Repo Man\"; additionally the song was covered by the English post-punk band Television Personalities on their album \"Don't Cry Baby, It's Only a Movie\".\nSeminal punk group the Sex Pistols covered \"Roadrunner\" on \"The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle\". Joan Jett sang \"Roadrunner\" on her cover album, \"The Hit List\". In 2009 Titus Andronicus covered \"Roadrunner\" on its EP \"The Innocents Abroad \u2013 Live in London 23/02/09;\" this recording was subsequently included on the fan compilation \"Feats of Strength.\" Additional covers of \"Roadrunner\" include those by Wire and Richman's labelmates the Greg Kihn Band.\nEnglish rock band Echo &amp; the Bunnymen covered \"She Cracked\" live on \"\" in 1985, although with some altered lyrics. Siouxsie and the Banshees released \"She Cracked\" as the extra b-side of \"This Wheel's on Fire\" 1987 double-pack 7-inch, collected on \"Downside Up\". Additionally, American grunge band Seaweed covered \"She Cracked\" on the \"John Peel Sub-Pop Sessions\" album, in 1994.\nFellow Boston Indie Band Galaxie 500 covered \"Don't Let Our Youth Go to Waste\" on their debut album, \"Today\" in 1987. The song became a staple of their live performances until they disbanded in 1991.\nDiscography.\nSingles.\nAll singles are credited to Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers unless otherwise noted.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "30353", "revid": "3927239", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30353", "title": "Trumpet", "text": "Brass instrument\nThe trumpet is a brass instrument commonly used in classical and jazz ensembles. The trumpet group ranges from the piccolo trumpet\u2014with the highest register in the brass family\u2014to the bass trumpet, pitched one octave below the standard B\u266d or C trumpet.\nTrumpet-like instruments have historically been used as signaling devices in battle or hunting, with examples dating back to the 2nd Millennium\u00a0BC. They began to be used as musical instruments only in the late 14th or early 15th century. Trumpets are used in art music styles, appearing in orchestras, concert bands, chamber music groups, and jazz ensembles. They are also common in popular music and are generally included in school bands. Sound is produced by vibrating the lips in a mouthpiece, which starts a standing wave in the air column of the instrument. Since the late 15th century, trumpets have primarily been constructed of brass tubing, usually bent twice into a rounded rectangular shape.\nThere are many distinct types of trumpet. The most common is a transposing instrument pitched in B\u266d with a tubing length of about . The cornet is similar to the trumpet but has a conical bore (the trumpet has a cylindrical bore) and its tubing is generally wound differently. Early trumpets did not provide means to change the length of tubing, whereas modern instruments generally have three (or sometimes four) valves in order to change their pitch. Most trumpets have valves of the piston type, while some have the rotary type. The use of rotary-valved trumpets is more common in orchestral settings (especially in German and German-style orchestras), although this practice varies by country. A musician who plays the trumpet is called a \"trumpet player\" or \"trumpeter\".\nEtymology.\nThe English word \"trumpet\" was first used in the late 14th century. The word came from Old French , which is a diminutive of . The word \"trump\", meaning \"trumpet\", was first used in English in 1300. The word comes from Old French 'long, tube-like musical wind instrument' (c. 1100s), cognate with Proven\u00e7al , Italian , all probably from a Germanic source (compare Old High German , Old Norse 'trumpet'), of imitative origin.\"\nHistory.\nThe earliest trumpets date back to 2000\u00a0BC and earlier. The bronze and silver Tutankhamun's trumpets from his grave in Egypt, bronze lurs from Scandinavia, and metal trumpets from China date back to this period. Trumpets from the Oxus civilization (3rd millennium BC) of Central Asia have decorated swellings in the middle, yet are made out of one sheet of metal, which is considered a technical wonder for its time.\nThe Salpinx was a straight trumpet long, made of bone or bronze. Homer's \"Iliad\" (9th or 8th century BCE) contain the earliest reference to its sound and further, frequent descriptions are found throughout the Classical Period. Salpinx contests were a part of the original Olympic Games. The Shofar, made from a ram horn and the Hatzotzeroth, made of metal, are both mentioned in the Bible. They were said to have been played in Solomon's Temple around 3,000 years ago. They are still used on certain religious days.\nThe Moche people of ancient Peru depicted trumpets in their art going back to AD\u00a0300. The earliest trumpets were signaling instruments used for military or religious purposes, rather than music in the modern sense; and the modern bugle continues this signaling tradition.\nImprovements to instrument design and metal making in the late Middle Ages and Renaissance led to an increased usefulness of the trumpet as a musical instrument. The natural trumpets of this era consisted of a single coiled tube without valves and therefore could only produce the notes of a single overtone series. Changing keys required the player to change crooks of the instrument. The development of the upper, \"clarino\" register by specialist trumpeters\u2014notably Cesare Bendinelli\u2014would lend itself well to the Baroque era, also known as the \"Golden Age of the natural trumpet.\" During this period, a vast body of music was written for virtuoso trumpeters. The art was revived in the mid-20th century and natural trumpet playing is again a thriving art around the world. Many modern players in Germany and the UK who perform Baroque music use a version of the natural trumpet fitted with three or four vent holes to aid in correcting out-of-tune notes in the harmonic series.\nThe melody-dominated homophony of the classical and romantic periods relegated the trumpet to a secondary role by most major composers owing to the limitations of the natural trumpet. Berlioz wrote in 1844:\nNotwithstanding the real loftiness and distinguished nature of its quality of tone, there are few instruments that have been more degraded (than the trumpet). Down to Beethoven and Weber, every composer\u00a0\u2013 not excepting Mozart\u00a0\u2013 persisted in confining it to the unworthy function of filling up, or in causing it to sound two or three commonplace rhythmical formulae.\nConstruction.\nThe trumpet is constructed of brass tubing bent twice into a rounded oblong shape. As with all brass instruments, sound is produced by blowing air through slightly separated lips, producing a \"buzzing\" sound into the mouthpiece and starting a standing wave vibration in the air column inside the trumpet. The player can select the pitch from a range of overtones or harmonics by changing the lip aperture and tension (known as the embouchure).\nThe mouthpiece has a circular rim, which provides a comfortable environment for the lips' vibration. Directly behind the rim is the cup, which channels the air into a much smaller opening (the back bore or shank) that tapers out slightly to match the diameter of the trumpet's lead pipe. The dimensions of these parts of the mouthpiece affect the timbre or quality of sound, the ease of playability, and player comfort. Generally, the wider and deeper the cup, the darker the sound and timbre.\nModern trumpets have three (or, infrequently, four) piston valves, each of which increases the length of tubing when engaged, thereby lowering the pitch. The first valve lowers the instrument's pitch by a whole step (two semitones), the second valve by a half step (one semitone), and the third valve by one and a half steps (three semitones). Having three valves provides eight possible valve combinations (including \"none\"), but only seven different tubing lengths, because the third valve alone gives essentially the same tubing length as the 1\u20132 combination. (In practice there is often a deliberately designed slight difference between \"1\u20132\" and \"3\", and in that case trumpet players will select the alternative that gives the best tuning for the particular note being played.) When a fourth valve is present, as with some piccolo trumpets, it usually lowers the pitch a perfect fourth (five semitones). Used singly and in combination these valves make the instrument fully chromatic, i.e., able to play all twelve pitches of classical music. For more information about the different types of valves, see Brass instrument valves.\nThe overall pitch of the trumpet can be raised or lowered by the use of the tuning slide. Pulling the slide out lowers the pitch; pushing the slide in raises it. Pitch can be \"bent\" using the embouchure only.\nTo overcome the problems of intonation and reduce the use of the slides, Renold Schilke designed the tuning-bell trumpet. Removing the usual brace between the bell and a valve body allows the use of a sliding bell; the player may then tune the horn with the bell while leaving the slide pushed in, or nearly so, thereby improving intonation and overall response.\nA trumpet becomes a closed tube when the player presses it to the lips; therefore, the instrument only naturally produces every other overtone of the harmonic series. The shape of the bell makes the missing overtones audible. Most notes in the series are slightly out of tune and modern trumpets have slide mechanisms for the first and third valves with which the player can compensate by \"throwing\" (extending) or retracting one or both slides, using the left thumb and ring finger for the first and third valve slides respectively.\nTrumpets can be constructed from other materials, including plastic.\nTypes.\nThe most common type is the B\u266d trumpet, but A, C, D, E\u266d, E, low F, and G trumpets are also available. The C trumpet is most common in American orchestral playing, where it is used alongside the B\u266d trumpet. Orchestral trumpet players are adept at transposing music at sight, frequently playing music written for the A, B\u266d, D, E\u266d, E or F trumpet as well as for the B, C\u266f, F\u266f or G trumpet (which is used more rarely) on the C trumpet or B\u266d trumpet.\nThe smallest trumpets are referred to as piccolo trumpets. The most common models are built to play in both B\u266d and A, with separate leadpipes for each key. The tubing in the B\u266d piccolo trumpet is one-half the length of that in a standard B\u266d trumpet making it sound an octave higher. Piccolo trumpets in G, F and C are also manufactured, but are less common. Almost all piccolo trumpets have four valves instead of three\u2014the fourth valve usually lowers the pitch by a fourth, making some lower notes accessible and creating alternate fingerings for certain trills. Maurice Andr\u00e9, H\u00e5kan Hardenberger, David Mason, and Wynton Marsalis are some well-known trumpet players known for their virtuosity on the piccolo trumpet.\nTrumpets pitched in the key of low G are also called sopranos, or soprano bugles, after their adaptation from military bugles. Traditionally used in drum and bugle corps, sopranos employ either rotary valves or piston valves.\nThe bass trumpet is at the same pitch as a trombone and is usually played by a trombone player, although its music is written in treble clef. Most bass trumpets are pitched in either C or B\u266d. The C bass trumpet sounds an octave lower than written, and the B\u266d bass sounds a major ninth (B\u266d) lower, making them both transposing instruments.\nThe historical slide trumpet was probably first developed in the late 14th century for use in alta cappella wind bands. Deriving from early straight trumpets, the Renaissance slide trumpet was essentially a natural trumpet with a sliding leadpipe. This single slide was awkward, as the entire instrument moved, and the range of the slide was probably no more than a major third. Originals were probably pitched in D, to fit with shawms in D and G, probably at a typical pitch standard near A=466\u00a0Hz. No known instruments from this period survive, so the details\u2014and even the existence\u2014of a Renaissance slide trumpet is a matter of debate among scholars. While there is documentation (written and artistic) of its existence, there is also conjecture that its slide would have been impractical.\nSome slide trumpet designs saw use in England in the 18th century.\nThe pocket trumpet is a compact B\u266d trumpet. The bell is usually smaller than a standard trumpet bell and the tubing is more tightly wound to reduce the instrument size without reducing the total tube length. Its design is not standardized, and the quality of various models varies greatly. It can have a unique warm sound and voice-like articulation. Since many pocket trumpet models suffer from poor design as well as poor manufacturing, the intonation, tone color and dynamic range of such instruments are severely hindered. Professional-standard instruments are, however, available. While they are not a substitute for the full-sized instrument, they can be useful in certain contexts. The jazz musician Don Cherry was renowned for his playing of the pocket instrument.\nThe tubing of the bell section of a herald trumpet is straight, making it long enough to accommodate a hanging banner. This instrument is mostly used for ceremonial events such as parades and fanfares.\nDavid Monette designed the flumpet in 1989 for jazz musician Art Farmer. It is a hybrid of a trumpet and a flugelhorn, pitched in B\u266d and using three piston valves.\nOther variations include rotary-valve, or German, trumpets (which are commonly used in professional German and Austrian orchestras), alto and Baroque trumpets, and the Vienna valve trumpet (primarily used in Viennese brass ensembles and orchestras such as the Vienna Philharmonic and Mnozil Brass).\nThe trumpet is often confused with its close relative the cornet, which has a more conical tubing shape compared to the trumpet's more cylindrical tube. This, along with additional bends in the cornet's tubing, gives the cornet a slightly mellower tone, but the instruments are otherwise nearly identical. They have the same length of tubing and, therefore, the same pitch, so music written for one of them is playable on the other. Another relative, the flugelhorn, has tubing that is even more conical than that of the cornet, and an even mellower tone. It is sometimes supplied with a fourth valve to improve the intonation of some lower notes.\nPlaying.\nFingering.\nOn any modern trumpet, cornet, or flugelhorn, pressing the valves indicated by the numbers below produces the written notes shown. \"Open\" means all valves up, \"1\" means first valve, \"1\u20132\" means first and second valve simultaneously, and so on. The sounding pitch depends on the transposition of the instrument. Engaging the fourth valve, if present, usually drops any of these pitches by a perfect fourth as well. Within each overtone series, the different pitches are attained by changing the embouchure. \nEach overtone series on the trumpet begins with the first overtone\u2014the fundamental of each overtone series cannot be produced except as a pedal tone. Notes in parentheses are the sixth overtone, representing a pitch with a frequency of seven times that of the fundamental; while this pitch is close to the note shown, it is flat relative to equal temperament, and use of those fingerings is generally avoided.\nThe fingering schema arises from the length of each valve's tubing (a longer tube produces a lower pitch). Valve \"1\" increases the tubing length enough to lower the pitch by one whole step, valve \"2\" by one half step, and valve \"3\" by one and a half steps. This scheme and the nature of the overtone series create the possibility of alternate fingerings for certain notes. For example, third-space \"C\" can be produced with no valves engaged (standard fingering) or with valves 2\u20133. Also, any note produced with 1\u20132 as its standard fingering can also be produced with valve 3 \u2013 each drops the pitch by &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1+1\u20442 steps. Alternate fingerings may be used to improve facility in certain passages, or to aid in intonation. Extending the third valve slide when using the fingerings 1\u20133 or 1-2-3 further lowers the pitch slightly to improve intonation.\nSome of the partials of the harmonic series that a modern B\u266d trumpet can play for each combination of valves pressed are in tune with 12-tone equal temperament and some are not.\nMutes.\nVarious types of mutes can be placed in or over the bell, which decreases volume and changes timbre. Trumpets have a wide selection of mutes: common ones include the straight mute, cup mute, harmon mute (wah-wah or wow-wow mute, among other names), plunger, bucket mute, and practice mute. A straight mute is generally used when the type of mute is not specified. Jazz and commercial music call for a wider range of mutes than most classical music and many mutes were invented for jazz orchestrators.\nMutes can be made of many materials, including fiberglass, plastic, cardboard, metal, and \"stone lining\", a trade name of the Humes &amp; Berg company. They are often held in place with cork. To better keep the mute in place, players sometimes dampen the cork by blowing warm, moist air on it.\nThe straight mute is conical and constructed of either metal (usually aluminum)\u2014which produces a bright, piercing sound\u2014or another material, which produces a darker, stuffier sound. The cup mute is shaped like a straight mute with an additional, bell-facing cup at the end, and produces a darker tone than a straight mute. The harmon mute is made of metal (usually aluminum or copper) and consists of a \"stem\" inserted into a large chamber. The stem can be extended or removed to produce different timbres, and waving one's hand in front of the mute produces a \"wah-wah\" sound, hence the mute's colloquial name.\nRange.\nUsing standard technique, the lowest note is the written F\u266f below middle C. There is no actual limit to how high brass instruments can play, but fingering charts generally go up to the high C two octaves above middle C. Several trumpeters have achieved fame for their proficiency in the extreme high register, among them Maynard Ferguson, Cat Anderson, Dizzy Gillespie, Doc Severinsen, John Madrid, and more recently Wayne Bergeron, Louis Dowdeswell, Thomas Gansch, James Morrison, Jon Faddis and Arturo Sandoval. It is also possible to produce pedal tones below the low F\u266f, which is a device occasionally employed in the contemporary repertoire for the instrument.\nExtended technique.\nContemporary music for the trumpet makes wide uses of extended trumpet techniques.\nFlutter tonguing: The trumpeter rolls the tip of the tongue (as if rolling an \"R\" in Spanish) to produce a 'growling like' tone. This technique is widely employed by composers like Berio and Stockhausen.\nGrowling: Simultaneously playing tone and using the back of the tongue to vibrate the uvula, creating a distinct sound. Most trumpet players will use a plunger with this technique to achieve a particular sound heard in a lot of Chicago Jazz of the 1950s.\nDouble tonguing: The player articulates using the syllables \"ta-ka ta-ka ta-ka\".\nTriple tonguing: The same as double tonguing, but with the syllables \"ta-ta-ka ta-ta-ka ta-ta-ka\".\nDoodle tongue: The trumpeter tongues as if saying the word \"doodle\". This is a very faint tonguing similar in sound to a valve tremolo.\nGlissando: Trumpeters can slide between notes by depressing the valves halfway and changing the lip tension. Modern repertoire makes extensive use of this technique.\nVibrato: It is often regulated in contemporary repertoire through specific notation. Composers can call for everything from fast, slow or no vibrato to actual rhythmic patterns played with vibrato.\nPedal tone: Composers have written notes as low as two-and-a-half octaves below the low F\u266f at the bottom of the standard range. Extreme low pedals are produced by slipping the lower lip out of the mouthpiece. Claude Gordon assigned pedals as part of his trumpet practice routines, that were a systematic expansion on his lessons with Herbert L. Clarke. The technique was pioneered by Bohumir Kryl.\nMicrotones: Composers such as Scelsi and Stockhausen have made wide use of the trumpet's ability to play microtonally. Some instruments feature a fourth valve that provides a quarter-tone step between each note. The jazz musician Ibrahim Maalouf uses such a trumpet, invented by his father to make it possible to play Arab maqams.\nValve tremolo: Many notes on the trumpet can be played in several different valve combinations. By alternating between valve combinations on the same note, a tremolo effect can be created. Berio makes extended use of this technique in his \"Sequenza X.\"\nNoises: By hissing, clicking, or breathing through the instrument, the trumpet can be made to resonate in ways that do not sound at all like a trumpet. Noises may require amplification.\nPreparation: Composers have called for trumpeters to play under water, or with certain slides removed. It is increasingly common for composers to specify all sorts of preparations for trumpet. Extreme preparations involve alternate constructions, such as double bells and extra valves.\nSplit tone: Trumpeters can produce more than one tone simultaneously by vibrating the two lips at different speeds. The interval produced is usually an octave or a fifth.\nLip-trill or shake: Also known as \"lip-slurs\". By rapidly varying air speed, but not changing the depressed valves, the pitch can vary quickly between adjacent harmonic partials. Shakes and lip-trills can vary in speed, and in the distance between the partials. However, lip-trills and shakes usually involve the next partial up from the written note.\nMulti-phonics: Playing a note and \"humming\" a different note simultaneously. For example, sustaining a middle C and humming a major 3rd \"E\" at the same time.\nCircular breathing: A technique wind players use to produce uninterrupted tone, without pauses for breaths. The player puffs up the cheeks, storing air, then breathes in rapidly through the nose while using the cheeks to continue pushing air outwards.\nInstruction and method books.\nOne trumpet method is Jean-Baptiste Arban's \"Complete Conservatory Method for Trumpet (Cornet)\". Other well-known method books include \"Technical Studies\" by Herbert L. Clarke, \"Grand Method\" by Louis Saint-Jacome, \"Daily Drills and Technical Studies\" by Max Schlossberg, and methods by Ernest S. Williams, Claude Gordon, Charles Colin, James Stamp, and Louis Davidson. A common method book for beginners is the Walter Beeler's \"Method for the Cornet\", and there have been several instruction books written by virtuoso Allen Vizzutti. Merri Franquin wrote a \"Complete Method for Modern Trumpet\", which fell into obscurity for much of the twentieth century until public endorsements by Maurice Andr\u00e9 revived interest in this work.\nPlayers.\nIn early jazz, Louis Armstrong was well known for his virtuosity and his improvisations on the Hot Five and Hot Seven recordings, and his switch from cornet to trumpet is often cited as heralding the trumpet's dominance over the cornet in jazz. Dizzy Gillespie was a gifted improviser with an extremely high (but musical) range, building on the style of Roy Eldridge but adding new layers of harmonic complexity. Gillespie had an enormous impact on virtually every subsequent trumpeter, both by the example of his playing and as a mentor to younger musicians. Miles Davis is widely considered one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century\u2014his style was distinctive and widely imitated. Davis' phrasing and sense of space in his solos have been models for generations of jazz musicians. Cat Anderson was a trumpet player who was known for the ability to play extremely high with an even more extreme volume, who played with Duke Ellington's Big Band. Maynard Ferguson came to prominence playing in Stan Kenton's orchestra, before forming his own band in 1957. He was noted for being able to play accurately in a remarkably high register.\nRepertoire.\nSolos.\nIn the 1790s Anton Weidinger developed the first successful keyed trumpet, capable of playing chromatically. Joseph Haydn's Trumpet Concerto was written for him in 1796 and startled contemporary audiences by its novelty, a fact shown off by some stepwise melodies played low in the instrument's range.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Born and raised in Bristol, in southwest England, he began his career as an early member of the band Massive Attack, alongside Robert Del Naja, Grant Marshall and Andrew Vowles. Through his work with Massive Attack and other artists, Tricky became a major figure in the Bristol underground scene, which gave rise to multiple internationally recognized artists and the music genre of trip hop.\nTricky embarked on a solo career with his debut album, \"Maxinquaye\", in 1995. The release won Tricky popular acclaim and marked the beginning of a lengthy collaborative partnership with vocalist Martina Topley-Bird. He released four more studio albums before the end of the decade, including \"Pre-Millennium Tension\" and the pseudonymous \"Nearly God\", both in 1996. He has gone on to release nine studio albums since 2000, most recently \"Fall to Pieces\" (2020). In 2016, he joined Massive Attack on stage for the first time in two decades while continuing his solo career.\nTricky is a pioneer of trip hop music, and his work is noted for its dark, layered musical style that blends disparate cultural influences and genres, including hip hop, alternative rock, and ragga. He has collaborated with a wide range of artists over the course of his career, including Terry Hall, Bj\u00f6rk, Gravediggaz, Alanis Morissette, Grace Jones and PJ Harvey.\nEarly life.\nTricky was born Adrian Nicholas Matthews Thaws on 27 January 1968 in Knowle West, Bristol, to a Jamaican father and a Ghanaian-English mother. His mother, Maxine Quaye, died either by suicide or due to epilepsy complications when Tricky was four. His father, Roy Thaws, operated the Studio 17 sound system (formerly known as \"Tarzan the High Priest\") with his brother Rupert and his own father, Hector. Bristol musician Bunny Marrett claimed in 2012, \"It became the most popular sound system in Bristol at the time.\"\nTricky experienced a difficult childhood in Knowle West, an economically deprived area in Southern Bristol. He became involved in crime at an early age, joining a gang that was involved in car theft, burglary, fights, and promiscuity. Tricky spent his youth in the care of his grandmother, who often let him watch old horror films instead of going to school. At 15, he began to write lyrics (\"I like to rock, I like to dance, I like pretty girls taking down their pants\", \"MixMag\", 1996). When he was 17, he spent some time in prison after purchasing forged \u00a350 notes from a friend, who later informed the police. Tricky stated in an interview afterward, \"Prison was really good. I'm never going back.\"\nCareer.\n1987\u20131994: The Wild Bunch, Massive Attack.\nIn the mid-1980s, Tricky met DJ Milo and spent time with a sound system called the Wild Bunch, which, by 1987, evolved into Massive Attack. He received the nickname \"Tricky Kid,\" and, at age 18, became a member of the Fresh\u00a04, a rap group built from the Wild Bunch. He also rapped on Massive Attack's acclaimed debut album, \"Blue Lines\" (1991).\nIn 1991, before the release of \"Blue Lines\", he met Martina Topley-Bird in Bristol. Some time later, she came to his house and mentioned to Tricky and Mark Stewart that she could sing. Martina was only 15 years old, but her \"honey-coated vox\" impressed them, and they recorded a song called \"Aftermath\" (although \"The Face\" '95 mentions that the first song they recorded together was called \"Shoebox\"). Tricky showed \"Aftermath\" to Massive Attack, but they were not interested. In 1993, he decided to press a few hundred vinyl copies of the song. In 1995, a white label record got him a contract with Island Records, and he started to record his first solo album, \"Maxinquaye\".\n1995\u20132001: Solo breakthrough.\nTricky left Massive Attack to release his debut album, \"Maxinquaye\", co-produced by himself and Mark Saunders and prominently featuring singer Martina Topley-Bird. The album was successful, and Tricky consequently attained international fame, something he was notably uncomfortable with. The \"Maxinquaye\" album review by \"Rolling Stone\" read: \"Tricky devoured everything from American hip-hop and soul to reggae and the more melancholic strains of '80s British rock\".\nAuthors David Hesmondhalgh and Caspar Melville wrote in the book \"Global Noise: Rap and Hip-Hop Outside the USA\": \"Tricky showed his debt to hip-hop aesthetics by reconstructualising samples and slices of both the most respected black music (Public Enemy) and the tackiest pop (quoting David Cassidy's \"How Can I Be Sure?\").\" As the \"Rolling Stone\" article further explained, Tricky created \"a mercurial style of dance music that immediately finds it [\"sic\"] own fast feet.\"\nTricky failed to complete a number of lyrics begun for the Massive Attack album \"Protection\" and gave the band some of the lyrics he had written for \"Maxinquaye\" instead, meaning there is significant overlap in the lyrics of songs on the two albums\u2014specifically with \"Overcome\" on \"Maxinquaye\" and \"Karmacoma\" on \"Protection\"; and \"Hell is 'Round the Corner\" on \"Maxinquaye\" and \"Eurochild\" on \"Protection.\" Tricky found it difficult to cope with the huge success of \"Maxinquaye\" and subsequently eschewed the laidback soul sound of the first album to create an increasingly edgy and aggressive punk style of music.\nIn 1996, Neneh Cherry and Bj\u00f6rk appeared as guests on his second album \"Nearly God\". The opening number was a cover of the Siouxsie and the Banshees pre-trip-hop song \"Tattoo\" that had previously inspired Tricky when he forged his style.\nIn 2001, Tricky appeared on the \"Thirteen Ghosts\" soundtrack with the song \"Excess\" which (briefly) features Alanis Morissette during two of the choruses. In 2002, that song also appeared on the \"Queen of the Damned\" soundtrack.\n2002\u20132011: \"Mixed Race\" and other work.\nTricky's studio album \"Knowle West Boy\" was released in the UK and Ireland in July 2008, and September 2008 in the US. The first single from the album was \"Council Estate\" and features the artist as the sole vocalist: \"It's the first single I've ever done with just me on vocals. I couldn't whisper that song. I had to come out of myself and do a loud, screaming vocal. I wanted to be a proper frontman on that one.\" In an interview with \"The Skinny\" in July 2008, Tricky mentioned that \"Knowle West Boy\" was the first album for which he decided to enlist a co-producer. Ex-Suede guitarist Bernard Butler was Tricky's initial selection, but, less than enamoured with Butler's technical prowess, Tricky finished the album by totally re-recording all of the material.\nOn 8 December 2009, Tricky's 1995 debut album \"Maxinquaye\" was reissued with a bonus 13-track CD featuring B-sides, outtakes and seven previously unreleased mixes of songs such as \"Overcome\", \"Hell is Round the Corner\" and \"Black Steel\".\nIn December 2009, the media reported that Massive Attack met Tricky in Paris and asked him to work on a future project\u2014Daddy G said: \"Things seem like they've healed between us and Tricky. It's been quite well documented how us and Tricky get on, hasn't it? It's not that well, but things have changed. Things have softened up. We saw Tricky a couple of weeks ago in Paris and it was quite an amicable meeting after five or six years.\" Tricky agreed to record with the band and he revealed in a June 2013 interview that \"there's a couple of songs which are OK, which are really good actually to be honest with you\". However, Tricky also stated in June 2013 that he could not spend more than two or three days with Massive Attack and described band member Daddy\u00a0G as \"very arrogant\".\nTricky's ninth album \"Mixed Race\" was released on 27 September 2010 and the first single from the album became available on 23 August. The album includes contributions from Franky Riley, Terry Lynn, Bobby Gillespie, Hamadouche, Blackman and Tricky's youngest brother Marlon Thaws.\nIn June 2011, Tricky's then label Brownpunk signed on Mexican band My Black Heart Machine for one single, \"It Beats Like This\", which Tricky co-produced. My Black Heart Machine was then commissioned by the label to cover a song from Maxinquaye for an album of covers by Brownpunk's roster; the band chose \"Hell Is Round the Corner\". \"It Beats Like This\" was released independently by the band on their first EP in April 2013.\nTricky produced rapper Omni's album \"IamOmni (produced by Tricky)\" (released under the moniker \"IamOmni\") that was available from 30 August 2011 as a free download on Omni's official site.\n2011\u2013present: \"False Idols\", live events, \"Ununiform\".\nOn 26 June 2011, Tricky appeared on stage during American singer Beyonc\u00e9's historic 2011 Glastonbury Festival Performance on the pyramid stage for the track \"Baby Boy\". Partly the result of technical difficulties with his microphone, he later stated he was \"mortified\" by his own performance, saying, \"I've never been so embarrassed. My body just froze\".\nIn April 2012, Tricky performed \"Maxinquaye\" with Martina Topley-Bird at several concerts around the UK including, for the first time in several years in his home town of Bristol. The concerts featured regular interruptions orchestrated by Tricky, where he brought his youngest brother, Marlon Thaws to rap on stage alongside other local rappers as well as encouraging the audience to come up on stage. The review of the concert in Manchester said it was \"shambolic\" and a \"car crash\" with Tricky often leaving the stage and continuously forgetting his words, leaving Topley Bird to carry the delivery of the tracks, resulting in many leaving early after repeated issues with Tricky's behaviour and shouts of \"wanker\" from the crowd.\nIn February 2013, Tricky announced the release of a new album, \"False Idols\". The album is the follow-up from his 2010 \"Mixed Race\" and featured Peter Silberman, Fifi Rong and Nneka. Tricky released this statement about the album:\n\"This new album I'll stand behind every track. I don't care whether people like it. I'm doing what I want to do, which is what I did with my first record. That's what made me who I was in the beginning. If people don't like it, it don't matter to me because I'm back where I was.\"\nIn spring 2014, it was announced that Tricky is to perform at a number of festivals throughout Europe over the summer of 2014, including Control Day Out in Romania, festival Couleur Caf\u00e9 in Belgium, Positivus Festival in Latvia and Galtres Parklands Festival in England, the latter of which he co-headlines with contemporaries Morcheeba.\nTricky announced a new album titled \"Adrian Thaws\" in June 2014. It was released on 8 September 2014. \"Skilled Mechanics\" was released in January 2016. The same month was released a song Tricky had written with 3D from Massive Attack, on the band's EP Ritual Spirit.\nHis thirteenth official studio album, \"ununiform\", was released on 22 September 2017, and featured collaborations with Asia Argento, Avalon Lurks, and Martina Topley-Bird, as well as a cover of Hole's \"Doll Parts\". Polish singer Marta Z\u0142akowska joined Tricky's band on a 2017 tour as a guest singer. She stepped in at the last minute when the originally planned singer dropped out.\nBlink, an imprint of Bonnier Books UK, has acquired Tricky's autobiography. Commissioning Editor Kerri Sharp acquired World rights from K7 Music \u2013 the independent music company headquartered in Berlin, where Tricky now lives. The book is currently untitled and will sell as a \u00a320 Hardback in October 2019.\nHis EP \"20,20\" was released on 6 March 2020. It featured the song \"Lonely Dancer\" recorded with the female singer Anika. She had previously worked with Beak in 2010. Tricky's next album, \"Fall to Pieces,\" was released in September 2020. The album featured singers Marta and Oh Land.\nIn October 2021, Tricky released a new album under the artist name 'Lonely Guest'. The self-titled album featured collaborations with Lee \"Scratch\" Perry, Idles' frontman Joe Talbot and Max\u00efmo Park's Paul Smith. It featured songs with previous album vocalists Marta and Oh Land.\nIn October 2025, Tricky and Polish singer Marta Z\u0142akowska released the joint album \"Out the Way\" via False Idols, which \"The Observer\" praised as \u201cthe pair\u2019s best work yet, displaying a rewarding rigour that often eludes Tricky.\u201d\nSide projects and film career.\nTricky has guest-starred on a number of albums, including an appearance on Live's fifth studio album, \"V\". This appearance came as Tricky and Live's lead singer Ed Kowalczyk had developed a close friendship, with Kowalczyk contributing vocals to \"Evolution Revolution Love\", a track on Tricky's album \"Blowback\".\nTricky has also acted in various films. He appeared in a significant supporting role in the 1997 Luc Besson film \"The Fifth Element\", playing the right-hand man \"Right Arm\" to evil businessman Mr. Zorg.\nHe also appears briefly in the 2004 Olivier Assayas film \"Clean\", playing himself, and had a large role in the music video for \"Parabol/Parabola\" by Tool. He was also rumoured to have a brief cameo in John Woo's 1997 movie \"Face/Off\", but has denied that this was the case, although his single \"Christiansands\" was featured in the movie. Tricky also appeared as Finn, a musician who loves and then dumps main character Lynn, in the US sitcom, \"Girlfriends\".\nIn 2001, Tricky appeared in online advertising for the web series \"We Deliver\", about a cannabis delivery service in New York City. Though he did not appear in any episodes, in the advertising it appears as if he is a customer of the service.\nThe launch of a record label named Brown Punk was announced in mid-2007 that was a collaboration between Tricky and former Island Records executive Chris Blackwell. At the time, Tricky said: \"Brown Punk represents a positive movement where you find intellectuals mixing with the working class, rock mixing with reggae and indie mixing with emo.\" The Dirty, The Gospel, Laid Blak Mexican band My Black Heart Machine were acts that were signed to the label, but as of October 2013, the label appears to be inactive.\nIn March 2023, the album \"When It's Going Wrong\" was released on False Idols. It is a collaboration between Tricky and Marta; a polish singer he has worked with since 2017. In April 2023 The German electro pop duo Berlin Banter released the single \"I'll Wait\" featuring Tricky.\nIdiosyncrasies and media issues.\nBy the time \"Pre-Millennium Tension\" was released in 1996, Tricky was increasingly irritated with the British press, particularly articles written in \"The Face\" magazine. \"The Face\" had been an early champion of \"Maxinquaye\", but saw Tricky as more a duo than a solo project. \"The Face\" published an article claiming that vocalist Martina Topley-Bird had to single-handedly bring up the child that Tricky had fathered.\nTricky has also been concerned with racial stereotyping by the media. In the documentary \"Naked &amp; Famous\", he stated that photographers wanted him to frown angrily in photos. He points to a cover of \"The Big Issue\", where he has a milder look on his face, as being more representative of how he feels. In the song \"Tricky Kid\" from \"Pre-Millennium Tension\", he wrote: \"As long as you're humble/Let you be the king of jungle\".\nThroughout his work, he blurs the normally clear gender definitions found in hip-hop. Despite the heavy influence he drew from American hip-hop in his debut album, \"Maxinquaye\", he fights against typical gender representations by, for example, dressing as a woman on the side sleeve of his album cover. As many of his tracks blend elements of varying types of music creating a difficult-to-define sound, so do his lyrics, creating a more ambiguous and blurry take on gender and sexuality.\nPersonal life.\nTricky has stated that he has \"been through a lot... I've been moved around from family to family, never stayed in one house from when I was born to the age of 16. ...I'm not normal. It's got a lot to do with my upbringing...Staying somewhere for three years then going off for three years. My uncles being villains. All that stuff. I've got quite a dysfunctional family...for some reason, in my family, the mothers always give the kids to the grandmothers\".\nTricky has fourteen paternal siblings.\nHe was in a brief relationship with Icelandic singer-songwriter Bj\u00f6rk in the 1990s. When asked in mid-2013 about the time the pair spent together, Tricky stated: \"I wasn't good for Bj\u00f6rk. I wasn't healthy for her. I feel she was really good to me, she gave me a lot of love and she really was a good person to me. I think she cared about me, right?\" He was also briefly married to Carmen Ejogo in early 1998 in Las Vegas.\nTricky fathered a daughter, Mina Mazy, on 19 March 1995 with Martina Topley-Bird, a musician he discovered when she was sitting on a wall near his Bristol home. Mina struggled with depression and took her own life on 8 May 2019. Following her death, Tricky stated \"It feels like I'm in a world that doesn't exist, knowing nothing will ever be the same again. No words or text can really explain, my soul feels empty.\"\nIn 2015, Tricky moved to live in Berlin, Germany, and later moved to Toulouse, France.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "30356", "revid": "47851454", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30356", "title": "Thelema", "text": "New religious movement founded by Aleister Crowley\nThelema () is a Western esoteric and occult social or spiritual philosophy and a new religious movement founded in the early 1900s by Aleister Crowley (1875\u20131947), an English writer, mystic, occultist, and ceremonial magician. Central to Thelema is the concept of discovering and following one's True Will, a divine and individual purpose that transcends ordinary desires. Crowley's system begins with \"The Book of the Law\", a text he maintained was dictated to him by a non-corporeal entity named Aiwass. This work outlines key principles, including the axioms \"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law\" and \"love is the law, love under will\", emphasizing personal freedom and the pursuit of one's true path.\nThe Thelemic cosmology features deities inspired by ancient Egyptian religion. The highest deity is Nuit, the night sky symbolized as a naked woman covered in stars, representing the ultimate source of possibilities. Hadit, the infinitely small point, symbolizes manifestation and motion. Ra-Hoor-Khuit, who is believed to be a form of Horus, represents the Sun and active energies of Thelemic magick. Crowley believed that discovering and following one's True Will is the path to self-realization and personal fulfillment, often referred to as the Great Work. The Creed of the Gnostic Mass also professes a belief in Chaos, Babalon, and Baphomet.\nMagick is a central practice in Thelema, involving various physical, mental, and spiritual exercises aimed at uncovering one's True Will and enacting change in alignment with it. Practices such as rituals, yoga, and meditation are used to explore consciousness and achieve self-mastery. The Gnostic Mass, a central ritual in Thelema, mirrors traditional religious services but conveys Thelemic principles. Thelemites also observe specific holy days, such as the Equinoxes and the Feast of the Three Days of the Writing of the Book of the Law, commemorating the writing of Thelema's foundational text.\nPost-Crowley figures like Jack Parsons, Kenneth Grant, James Lees, and Nema Andahadna have further developed Thelema, introducing new ideas, practices, and interpretations. Parsons conducted the Babalon Working to invoke the goddess Babalon, while Grant synthesized various traditions into his Typhonian Order. Lees created the English Qaballa, and Nema Andahadna developed Maat Magick.\nHistorical precedents.\nThe word () is rare in Classical Greek, where it \"signifies the appetitive will: desire, sometimes even sexual\", but it is frequent in the Septuagint. Early Christian writings occasionally use the word to refer to the human will, and even the will of the Devil, but it usually refers to the will of God. In his 5th-century sermon, Catholic philosopher and theologian Augustine of Hippo gave a similar instruction: \"Love, and what you will, do.\" ().\nIn the Renaissance, a character named \"Thelemia\" represents will or desire in the \"Hypnerotomachia Poliphili\" of the Dominican friar and writer Francesco Colonna. The protagonist Poliphilo has two allegorical guides, Logistica (reason) and Thelemia (will or desire). When forced to choose, he chooses fulfillment of his sexual will over logic. Colonna's work was a great influence on the Franciscan friar and writer Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, who in the 16th century used \"Th\u00e9l\u00e8me\", the French form of the word, as the name of a fictional abbey in his novels, \"Gargantua and Pantagruel\". The only rule of this Abbey was \"\" (\"\", or, \"Do what you will\").\nIn the mid-18th century, Sir Francis Dashwood inscribed the adage on a doorway of his abbey at Medmenham, where it served as the motto of the Hellfire Club. Rabelais's Abbey of Thelema has been referred to by later writers Sir Walter Besant and James Rice, in their novel \"The Monks of Thelema\" (1878), and C. R. Ashbee in his utopian romance \"The Building of Thelema\" (1910).\nDefinitions.\nIn Classical Greek.\nIn Classical Greek there are two words for will: \"thelema\" () and \"boule\" ().\nThe verb appears very early (Homer, early Attic inscriptions) and has the meanings of \"ready\", \"decide\" and \"desire\" (Homer, 3, 272, also in the sexual sense).\nIn the New Testament.\nIn the original Greek version of the New Testament the word \"thelema\" is used 62 or 64 times, twice in the plural (\"thelemata\"). Here, God's will is always and exclusively designated by the word \"thelema\" (\u03b8\u03ad\u03bb\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1, mostly in the singular), as the theologian Federico Tolli points out by means of the \"Theological Dictionary of the New Testament\" of 1938 (\"Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven\").\nFran\u00e7ois Rabelais and the Abbey of Th\u00e9l\u00e8me.\nFran\u00e7ois Rabelais was a Franciscan and later a Benedictine monk of the 16th century. Eventually he left the monastery to study medicine, and moved to the French city of Lyon in 1532. There he wrote \"Gargantua and Pantagruel,\" a connected series of books. They tell the story of two giants\u2014a father (Gargantua) and his son (Pantagruel) and their adventures\u2014written in an amusing, extravagant, and satirical vein.\nMost critics today agree that Rabelais wrote from a Christian humanist perspective. The Crowley biographer Lawrence Sutin notes this when contrasting the French author's beliefs with the Thelema of Aleister Crowley. In the previously mentioned story of Th\u00e9l\u00e8me, which critics analyze as referring in part to the suffering of loyal Christian reformists or \"evangelicals\" within the French Church, the reference to the Greek word \u03b8\u03ad\u03bb\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1 \"declares that the will of God rules in this abbey\". Sutin writes that Rabelais was no precursor of Thelema, with his beliefs containing elements of Stoicism and Christian kindness.\nIn his first book (ch. 52\u201357), Rabelais writes of this Abbey of Th\u00e9l\u00e8me, built by the giant Gargantua. It is a classical utopia presented in order to critique and assess the state of the society of Rabelais's day, as opposed to a modern utopian text that seeks to create the scenario in practice. It is a utopia where people's desires are more fulfilled. Satirical, it also epitomises the ideals considered in Rabelais's fiction. The inhabitants of the abbey were governed only by their own free will and pleasure, the only rule being \"Do What Thou Wilt\". Rabelais believed that men who are free, well born and bred have honour, which intrinsically leads to virtuous actions. When constrained, their noble natures turn instead to remove their servitude, because men desire what they are denied.\nSome modern Thelemites consider Crowley's work to build upon Rabelais's summary of the instinctively honourable nature of the Thelemite. Rabelais has been variously credited with the creation of the philosophy of Thelema, as one of the earliest people to refer to it. The current National Grand Master General of the U.S. Ordo Templi Orientis Grand Lodge has opined that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Saint Rabelais never intended his satirical, fictional device to serve as a practical blueprint for a real human society\u00a0... Our Thelema is that of \"The Book of the Law\" and the writings of Aleister Crowley.\nAleister Crowley wrote in \"The Antecedents of Thelema\" (1926), an incomplete work not published in his day, that Rabelais not only set forth the law of Thelema in a way similar to how Crowley understood it, but predicted and described in code Crowley's life and the holy text that he received, \"The Book of the Law\". Crowley said the work he had received was deeper, showing in more detail the technique people should practice, and revealing scientific mysteries. He said that Rabelais confines himself to portraying an ideal, rather than addressing questions of political economy and similar subjects, which must be solved in order to realize the Law.\nRabelais is included among the Saints of Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica.\nFrancis Dashwood and the Hellfire Club.\nSir Francis Dashwood adopted some of the ideas of Rabelais and invoked the same rule in French, when he founded a group called the Monks of Medmenham (better known as the Hellfire Club). An abbey was established at Medmenham, in a property which incorporated the ruins of a Cistercian abbey founded in 1201. The group was known as the Franciscans, not after Saint Francis of Assisi, but after its founder, Francis Dashwood, 11th Baron le Despencer. John Wilkes, George Dodington and other politicians were members. There is little direct evidence of what Dashwood's Hellfire Club practiced or believed. The one direct testimonial comes from John Wilkes, a member who never got into the chapter-room of the inner circle.\nSir Nathaniel Wraxall in his \"Historical Memoires\" (1815) accused the Monks of performing Satanic rituals, but these reports have been dismissed as hearsay. Daniel Willens argued that the group likely practiced Freemasonry, but also suggests Dashwood may have held secret Roman Catholic sacraments. He asks if Wilkes would have recognized a genuine Catholic Mass, even if he saw it himself and even if the underground version followed its public model precisely.\nCrowley\u2019s system was built on his time in the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn (he joined in 1899), on Rosicrucian currents and on early Theosophical ideas from Helena Blavatsky and others.\nBeliefs.\n\"The Book of the Law\".\nAleister Crowley's system of Thelema begins with \"The Book of the Law\", which bears the official name \"Liber AL vel Legis\". It was written in Cairo, Egypt, during his honeymoon with his new wife Rose Crowley (n\u00e9e\u00a0Kelly). A small book, \"Liber AL vel Legis\", contains just three chapters, each of which Crowley said he had written in exactly one hour\u2014beginning at noon on April 8, April 9, and April 10, 1904, respectively. Crowley also maintained that the book was dictated to him by a non-corporeal entity named Aiwass, whom he later identified as his Holy Guardian Angel. Crowley stated that \"no forger could have prepared so complex a set of numerical and literal puzzles\" and that study of the text would dispel all doubts about the method of how the book was obtained.\nBesides the reference to Rabelais made in the book, an analysis by Dave Evans found similarities to \"The Beloved of Hathor and Shrine of the Golden Hawk\", a play by Florence Farr. Evans says this may have resulted from the fact that \"both Farr and Crowley were thoroughly steeped in Golden Dawn imagery and teachings\", and that Crowley probably knew the same materials that inspired some of Farr's motifs. Sutin also found similarities between Thelema and the work of W. B. Yeats, attributing this to \"shared insight\" and perhaps to the older man's knowledge of Crowley's work.\nCrowley wrote several commentaries on \"The Book of the Law\", the last of which he wrote in 1925. The latter commentary, dubbed \"The Comment\", warns against discussing the book's contents, states that all \"questions of the Law are to be decided only by appeal to my writings\", and is signed by Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu i.\nOther core Thelemic works include \"The Vision and the Voice\" (1911) and the serial journal \"The Equinox\" (1919\u201323).\nAxioms.\nThree statements from \"The Book of the Law\" distill the practice and ethics of Thelema. Of these statements, one in particular, known as the \"Law of Thelema\", forms the central doctrine of Thelema. \"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law\". The first statement is then supplemented by a second, follow-up statement: \"Love is the law, love under will.\" These two statements are generally believed to be better understood in light of a third statement: \"Every man and every woman is a star.\"\nThese three statements have specific meanings:\nCosmology.\nThelema places its principal gods and goddesses\u2014three altogether\u2014from Ancient Egyptian religion as the speakers presented in \"Liber AL vel Legis\".\nThe highest deity in the theology of Thelema is the goddess Nuit (also spelled \"Nuith\"). She is envisioned as the night sky arching over the Earth, represented as a nude woman and typically depicted with stars covering her body. Nuit is conceived as the \"Great Mother\" and the ultimate source of all things, the collection of all possibilities, \"Infinite Space, and the Infinite Stars thereof\", and the circumference of an infinite circle or sphere. Nuit is derived from the Egyptian sky goddess Nut and is referred to poetically as \"Our Lady of the Stars\" and, in \"The Book of the Law\", as \"Queen of Space\" and \"Queen of Heaven\".\nThe second principal deity of Thelema is the god Hadit, conceived as the infinitely small point, and the complement and consort of Nuit. Hadit symbolizes manifestation, motion, and time. He is also described in \"Liber AL vel Legis\" as \"the flame that burns in every heart of man, and in the core of every star.\"\nHadit has sometimes been said to represent a \"point-event\" and all individual point-events within the body of Nuit. Hadit is said, in \"The Book of the Law\", to be \"perfect, being Not.\" Additionally, it is written of Nuit in \"Liber AL vel Legis\" that \"men speak not of Thee [Nuit] as One but as None.\"\nThe third deity of Thelemic theology is Ra-Hoor-Khuit, a manifestation of the ancient Egyptian deity Horus. He is symbolized as a throned man with the head of a hawk who carries a wand. He is associated with the Sun and the active energies of Thelemic magick.\nOther deities within the pantheon of Thelema are Hoor-paar-kraat (or Harpocrates), the god of silence and inner strength and the twin of Ra-Hoor-Khuit, as well as Babalon, the goddess of all pleasure known as the Virgin Whore, and Therion, the beast upon which Babalon rides who represents the wild animal within humankind and the force of nature.\nTrue Will.\nAccording to Crowley, every individual has a \"True Will\", which is to be distinguished from the ordinary wants and desires of the ego. True Will is essentially one's \"calling\" or \"purpose\" in life. \"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law\" for Crowley refers not to hedonism, fulfilling everyday desires, but to acting in response to that calling. According to Lon Milo DuQuette, a Thelemite is anyone who bases their actions on striving to discover and accomplish their true will, when a person does their True Will, it is like an orbit, their niche in the universal order, and the universe assists them:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;But the Magician knows that the pure Will of every man and every woman is already in perfect harmony with the divine Will; in fact, they are one and the same.\nFor the individual to follow their True Will, the everyday self's socially instilled inhibitions may have to be overcome via deconditioning. Crowley believed that to discover the True Will, one had to free the desires of the subconscious mind from the control of the conscious mind, especially the restrictions placed on sexual expression, which he associated with the power of divine creation. He identified the True Will of each individual with the Holy Guardian Angel, a \"daimon\" unique to each individual. The spiritual quest to find what you are meant to do and do it is also known in Thelema as the Great Work.\nEthics.\n\"Liber AL vel Legis\" makes some standards of individual conduct clear. The primary of these is \"Do what thou wilt\", which is presented as the sum of the law and a right. Some interpreters of Thelema believe that this right includes an obligation to allow others to do their own wills without interference, but \"Liber AL vel Legis\" makes no clear statement on the matter. Crowley himself wrote that there was no need to detail the ethics of Thelema for everything springs from \"Do what thou Wilt\". Crowley wrote several additional documents presenting his personal beliefs regarding individual conduct in light of the Law of Thelema, some of which indeed address the topic interference with the will of others: \"Liber OZ\", \"Duty\", and \"Liber II\".\n\"Liber OZ\" enumerates some of the individual's rights implied by the overarching right, \"Do what thou wilt\". For every individual, these include the right to \"live by one's own law\"; \"live in the way that one wills to do\"; \"work, play, and rest as one will\"; \"die when and how one will\"; \"eat and drink what one will\"; \"live where one will\"; \"move about the earth as one will\"; \"think, speak, write, draw, paint, carve, etch, mould, build, and dress as one will\"; \"love when, where and with whom one will\"; and \"kill those who would thwart these rights\".\n\"Duty\" is described as \"A note on the chief rules of practical conduct to be observed by those who accept the Law of Thelema.\" It is not a numbered \"Liber\" as the other documents Crowley intended for A\u2234A\u2234; instead, it is listed as a document explicitly intended for Ordo Templi Orientis. There are four sections:\nIn \"Liber II: The Message of the Master Therion\", the Law of Thelema is summarized briefly as \"Do what thou wilt\u2014then do nothing else.\" Crowley describes the pursuit of True Will as not merely detaching from possible results but also involving tireless energy. It is Nirvana but in a dynamic rather than static form. The True Will is described as the individual's orbit, and if one seeks to do anything else, one will encounter obstacles, as doing anything other than the Will is a hindrance to it.\nPractice.\nThe core of Thelemic thought is \"Do what thou wilt\". However, beyond this, there exists a wide range of interpretation of Thelema. Modern Thelema is a syncretic philosophy and religion, and many Thelemites try to avoid strongly dogmatic thinking. Crowley emphasized that each individual should follow their own inherent \"True Will\", rather than blindly following his teachings, saying he did not wish to found a flock of sheep. Thus, contemporary Thelemites may practice more than one religion, including Wicca, Gnosticism, Satanism, Setianism and Luciferianism. Many adherents of Thelema recognize correlations between Thelemic and other systems of spiritual thought; most borrow freely from the methods and practices of other traditions, including alchemy, astrology, qabalah, tantra, tarot divination and yoga. For example, Nu and Had are thought to correspond with the Tao and Teh of Taoism, Shakti and Shiva of the Hindu Tantras, Shunyata and Bodhicitta of Buddhism, Ain Soph and Kether in the Hermetic Qabalah.\nMagick.\nThelemic magick is a system of physical, mental, and spiritual exercises which practitioners believe are of benefit. Crowley defined magick as \"the Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformity with Will\", and spelled it with a 'k' to distinguish it from stage magic. He recommended magick as a means for discovering the True Will. Generally, magical practices in Thelema are designed to assist in finding and manifesting the True Will, although some include celebratory aspects as well. Crowley believed that after discovering the True Will, the magician must also remove any elements of himself that stand in the way of its success.\nCrowley was a prolific writer, integrating Eastern practices with Western magical practices from the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. He recommended a number of these practices to his followers, including: basic yoga (asana and pranayama); rituals of his own devising or based on those of the Golden Dawn, such as the lesser ritual of the pentagram, for banishing and invocation; \"Liber Samekh\", a ritual for the invocation of the Holy Guardian Angel; eucharistic rituals such as the \"Gnostic Mass\" and \"The Mass of the Phoenix\"; and \"Liber Resh\", consisting of four daily adorations to the sun. He also discussed sex magick and sexual gnosis in various forms involving masturbation and sexual intercourse between heterosexual and homosexual partners; practices which are among his suggestions for those in the higher degrees of Ordo Templi Orientis.\nOne goal in the study of Thelema within the magical Order of the A\u2234A\u2234 is for the magician to obtain the knowledge and conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel: conscious communication with their own personal daimon, thus gaining knowledge of their True Will. The chief task for one who has achieved this goes by the name of \"crossing the abyss\"; completely relinquishing the ego. If the aspirant is unprepared, he will cling to the ego instead, becoming a Black Brother. According to Crowley, the Black Brother slowly disintegrates, while preying on others for his own self-aggrandisement.\nCrowley taught skeptical examination of all results obtained through meditation or magick, at least for the student. He tied this to the necessity of keeping a magical record or diary, that attempts to list all conditions of the event. Remarking on the similarity of statements made by spiritually advanced people of their experiences, he said that fifty years from his time they would have a scientific name based on \"an understanding of the phenomenon\" to replace such terms as \"spiritual\" or \"supernatural\". Crowley stated that his work and that of his followers used \"the method of science; the aim of religion\", and that the genuine powers of the magician could in some way be objectively tested. This idea has been taken on by later practitioners of Thelema. They may consider that they are testing hypotheses with each magical experiment. The difficulty lies in the broadness of their definition of success, in which they may see as evidence of success things which a non-magician would not define as such, leading to confirmation bias. Crowley believed he could demonstrate, by his own example, the effectiveness of magick in producing certain subjective experiences that do not ordinarily result from taking hashish, enjoying oneself in Paris, or walking through the Sahara desert. It is not strictly necessary to practice ritual techniques to be a Thelemite, as due to the focus of Thelemic magick on the True Will, Crowley stated \"every intentional act is a magickal act.\"\nGnostic Mass.\nCrowley wrote 'The Gnostic Mass'\u00a0\u2014 technically called \"Liber XV\" or \"Book 15\"\u00a0\u2014 in 1913 while travelling in Moscow, Russia. The structure is similar to the Mass of the Eastern Orthodox Church and Roman Catholic Church, communicating the principles of Thelema. It is the central rite of Ordo Templi Orientis and its ecclesiastical arm, Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica.\nHolidays.\nThe Book of the Law gives several holy days to be observed by Thelemites. There are no established or dogmatic ways to celebrate these days, so as a result Thelemites will often take to their own devices or celebrate in groups, especially within Ordo Templi Orientis. These holy days are usually observed on the following dates:\nGreetings.\nThe number 93 is of great significance in Thelema. The central philosophy of Thelema is in two phrases from Liber AL: \"do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law\" and \"love is the law, love under will\". Crowley urged their use in everyday communications, and himself used them to greet people. Today, rather than using the full phrases, Thelemites often use numerological abbreviations to shorten these greeting in informal contexts, a practice Crowley also applied in his informal written correspondences. The two primary terms in these statements are 'will' and 'love', respectively. Using the Greek technique of isopsephy, which applies a numerical value to each letter, the letters of words \"thelema\" ('will') and \"agape\" ('love') each sum to 93:\nIn this way, the first phrase is abbreviated to \"93\" while the second is abbreviated to \"93 93/93\", with the division \"93/93\" symbolizing love \"under\" will.\nPost-Crowley developments.\nAleister Crowley was highly prolific and wrote on the subject of Thelema for over 35 years, and many of his books remain in print. During his time, there were several others who wrote on the subject, including U.S. O.T.O. Grand Master Charles Stansfeld Jones, whose works on Qabalah are still in print, and Major-General J. F. C. Fuller. Subsequent to Crowley, a number of figures have made significant contributions to Thelema. Each has their own following within the broader Thelemic community.\nJack Parsons.\nJohn Whiteside Parsons (1914\u20131952) was an American rocket engineer, chemist, and Thelemite occultist. Parsons converted to Thelema, and together with his first wife, Helen Northrup, joined the Agape Lodge, the Californian branch of Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.), in 1941. At Crowley's bidding, Parsons replaced Wilfred Talbot Smith as its leader in 1942 and ran the Lodge from his mansion on Orange Grove Boulevard.\nParsons identified four obstacles that prevented humans from achieving and performing their True Will, all of which he connected with fear: the fear of incompetence, the fear of the opinion of others, the fear of hurting others, and the fear of insecurity. He insisted that these must be overcome, writing that \"The Will must be freed of its fetters. The ruthless examination and destruction of taboos, complexes, frustrations, dislikes, fears and disgusts hostile to the Will is essential to progress.\"\nThe project was based on the ideas of Crowley, and his description of a similar project in his 1917 novel \"Moonchild\". The rituals performed drew largely upon rituals and sex magic described by Crowley. Crowley was in correspondence with Parsons during the course of the Babalon Working, and warned Parsons of his potential overreactions to the magic he was performing, while simultaneously deriding Parsons' work to others.\nA brief text entitled \"Liber 49\", self-referenced within the text as \"The Book of Babalon\", was written by Jack Parsons as a transmission from the goddess or force called 'Babalon' received by him during the Babalon Working. Parsons wrote that \"Liber 49\" constituted a fourth chapter of Crowley's \"Liber AL Vel Legis (The Book of the Law)\", the holy text of Thelema.\nKenneth Grant.\nKenneth Grant (1924\u20132011) was an English ceremonial magician and advocate of the Thelemic religion. A poet, novelist, and writer, he founded his own Thelemic organisation, the Typhonian Ordo Templi Orientis\u2014later renamed the Typhonian Order\u2014with his wife Steffi Grant.\nGrant drew eclectically on a range of sources in devising his teachings. Although based in Thelema, Grant's Typhonian tradition has been described as \"a \"bricolage\" of occultism, Neo-Vedanta, Hindu tantra, Western sexual magic, Surrealism, ufology and Lovecraftian gnosis\". Grant promoted what he termed the Typhonian or Draconian tradition of magic, and wrote that Thelema was only a recent manifestation of this wider tradition. In his books, he portrayed the Typhonian tradition as the world's oldest spiritual tradition, writing that it had ancient roots in Africa. The religious studies scholar Gordan Djurdjevic noted that Grant's historical claims regarding Typhonian history were \"at best highly speculative\" and lacked any supporting evidence; however he also suggested that Grant may never have intended these claims to be taken literally.\nGrant wrote that Indian spiritual traditions like Tantra and Yoga correlate to Western esoteric traditions and that both stem from a core ancient source and have parallels in the perennial philosophy promoted by the Traditionalist School of esotericists. He believed that by mastering magic, one masters this illusory universe, gaining personal liberation and recognising that only the Self really exists. Doing so, according to Grant, leads to the discovery of one's True Will, the central focus of Thelema. Grant further wrote that the realm of the Self was known as 'the Mauve Zone', and that it could be reached while in a state of deep sleep, where it has the symbolic appearance of a swamp. He also believed that the reality of consciousness, which he deemed the only true reality, was formless and thus presented as a void, although he also taught that it was symbolised by the Hindu goddess Kali and the Thelemic goddess Nuit.\nGrant's views on sex magic drew heavily on the importance of sexual dimorphism among humans and the subsequent differentiation of gender roles. Grant taught that the true secret of sex magic were bodily secretions, the most important of which was a woman's menstrual blood. In this he differed from Crowley, who viewed semen as the most important genital secretion. Grant referred to female sexual secretions as \"kalas\", a term adopted from Sanskrit. He thought that because women have kalas, they have oracular and visionary powers. The magical uses of female genital secretions are a recurring theme in Grant's writings.\nJames Lees.\nJames Lees (August 22, 1939 - 2015) was an English ceremonial magician known for creating the system he called English Qaballa. In November 1976, Lees explained how he had discovered the \"order &amp; value of the English Alphabet.\" Following this, Lees founded the order O\u2234A\u2234A\u2234 in order to assist others in the pursuit of their own spiritual paths. The first public report of the system known as English Qaballa (EQ) was published in 1979 by Ray Sherwin in an editorial in the final issue of his journal, \"The New Equinox\". Lees subsequently assumed the role of publisher of \"The New Equinox\" and, starting in 1981, published additional material about the EQ system over the course of five issues of the journal, extending into 1982.\nThe \"order &amp; value\" proposed by James Lees lays the letters out on the grid superimposed on the page of manuscript of \"Liber AL\" on which this verse (Ch. III, v. 47) appears (sheet 16 of Chapter III). Also appearing on this page are a diagonal line and a circled cross. \"The Book of the Law\" states that the book should only be printed with Crowley's hand-written version included, suggesting that there are mysteries in the \"chance shape of the letters and their position to one another\" of Crowley's handwriting. Whichever top-left to bottom-right diagonal is read the magical order of the letters is obtained.\nLittle, if any, further material on English Qaballa was published until the appearance of Jake Stratton-Kent's book, \"The Serpent Tongue: Liber 187\", in 2011. This was followed in 2016 by \"The Magickal Language of the Book of the Law: An English Qaballa Primer\" by Cath Thompson. An account of the creation, exploration, and continuing research and development of the system up to 2010, by James Lees and members of his group in England, is detailed in her 2018 book, \"All This and a Book\".\nNema Andahadna.\nNema Andahadna (1939\u20132018) practiced and wrote about magick (magical working, as defined by Aleister Crowley) for over thirty years. In 1974, she said she had channelled a short book called \"\".\nFrom her experience with Thelemic magick, she developed her own system of magic called \"Maat Magick\" which has the aim of transforming the human race. In 1979, she co-founded the Horus-Maat Lodge. The Lodge and her ideas have been featured in the writings of Kenneth Grant.\nHer writings have appeared in many publications, including the \"Cincinnati Journal of Ceremonial Magick\", \"Aeon\", and \"Starfire\". According to Donald Michael Kraig:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Nema has been one of the most influential occultists of the last quarter century although most occultists have never read her works. What Nema has done is influence those who have been writers and teachers.

{"id": "30359", "revid": "18840525", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30359", "title": "Tiber", "text": "Major river in central Italy\nThe Tiber ( ; ; ) is the third-longest river in Italy and the longest in Central Italy, rising in the Apennine Mountains in Emilia-Romagna and flowing through Tuscany, Umbria, and Lazio, where it is joined by the River Aniene, to the Tyrrhenian Sea, between Ostia and Fiumicino. It drains a basin estimated at . The river has achieved lasting fame as the main watercourse of the city of Rome, which was founded on its eastern banks.\nThe river rises at Mount Fumaiolo in Central Italy and flows in a generally southerly direction past Perugia and Rome to meet the sea at Ostia. The Tiber has advanced significantly at its mouth, by about , since Roman times, leaving the ancient port of Ostia Antica inland. However, it does not form a proportional delta, owing to a strong north-flowing sea current close to the shore, due to the steep shelving of the coast, and to slow tectonic subsidence.\nSources.\nThe source of the Tiber consists of two springs away from each other on Mount Fumaiolo. These springs are called \"Le Vene\". The springs are in a beech forest above sea level. During the 1930s, Benito Mussolini had an antique marble Roman column built at the point where the river rises, inscribed (\"Here is born the river / sacred to the destinies of Rome\"). An eagle is on the top of the column, part of its fascist symbolism. The first kilometres of the Tiber run through Valtiberina before entering Umbria.\nEtymology.\nThe genesis of the name \"Tiber\" probably was pre-Latin, like the Roman name of Tibur (modern Tivoli), and may be Italic in origin. The same root is found in the Latin \"praenomen\" \"Tiberius\". Also, Etruscan variants of this praenomen are in \"Thefarie\" (borrowed from Faliscan \"*Tiferios\", lit. '(He) from the Tiber' &lt; \"*Tiferis\" 'Tiber') and \"Teperie\" (via the Latin hydronym \"Tiber\").\nLegendary king Tiberinus, ninth in the king-list of Alba Longa, was said to have drowned in the River Albula, which was afterwards called \"Tiberis\". The myth may have explained a memory of an earlier, perhaps pre-Indo-European name for the river, \"white\" (\"alba\") with sediment, or \"from the mountains\" from pre-Indo-European word \"alba, albion\" mount, elevated area. \"Tiberis/Tifernus\" may be a pre-Indo-European substrate word related to Aegean \"tifos\" \"still water\", Greek phytonym \"\u03c4\u03cd\u03c6\u03b7\" a kind of swamp and river bank weed (\"Typha angustifolia\"), Iberian hydronyms \"Tibilis\", \"Tebro\" and Numidian \"Aquae Tibilitanae\". Yet another etymology is from *dubri-, water, considered by Alessio as Sicel, whence the form \u0398\u03cd\u03b2\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2 later Tiberis. This root *dubri- is widespread in Western Europe e.g. Dover, Portus Dubris.\nHistory.\nAccording to legend, the city of Rome was founded in 753 BC on the banks of the Tiber about from the sea at Ostia. Tiber Island, in the center of the river between Trastevere and the ancient city center, was the site of an important ancient ford and was later bridged. Legend says Rome's founders, the twin brothers Romulus and Remus, were abandoned on its waters, where they were rescued by the she-wolf, Lupa.\nThe river marked the boundary between the lands of the Etruscans to the west, the Sabines to the east and the Latins to the south. Benito Mussolini, born in Romagna, adjusted the boundary between Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna, so that the springs of the Tiber would lie in Romagna.\nThe Tiber was critically important to Roman trade and commerce, as ships could reach as far as upriver; some evidence indicates that it was used to ship grain from the Val Teverina as long ago as the fifth century BC. It was later used to ship stone, timber, and foodstuffs to Rome.\nDuring the Punic Wars of the third century BC, the harbour at Ostia became a key naval base. It later became Rome's most important port, where wheat, olive oil, and wine were imported from Rome's colonies around the Mediterranean. Wharves were also built along the riverside in Rome itself, lining the riverbanks around the Campus Martius area. The Romans connected the river with a sewer system (the \"Cloaca Maxima\") and with an underground network of tunnels and other channels, to bring its water into the middle of the city.\nWealthy Romans had garden-parks or \"horti\" on the banks of the river in Rome through the first century BC. These may have been sold and developed about a century later.\nThe heavy sedimentation of the river made maintaining Ostia difficult, prompting the emperors Claudius and Trajan to establish a new port on the Fiumicino in the first century AD. They built a new road, the \"Via Portuensis\", to connect Rome with Fiumicino, leaving the city by Porta Portese (the port gate). Both ports were eventually abandoned due to silting.\nSeveral popes attempted to improve navigation on the Tiber in the 17th and 18th centuries, with extensive dredging continuing into the 19th century. Trade was boosted for a while, but by the 20th century, silting had resulted in the river only being navigable as far as Rome.\nThe Tiber was once known for its floods \u2014 the Campus Martius is a flood plain and would regularly flood to a depth of . There were also numerous major floods; for example, on 15 September 1557 the river flooded to a height of above sea level, over 1,000 people died. The river is now confined between high stone embankments, which were begun in 1876. Within the city, the riverbanks are lined by boulevards known as \"lungoteveri\", streets \"along the Tiber\".\nBecause the river is identified with Rome, the terms \"swimming the Tiber\" or \"crossing the Tiber\" have come to be the shorthand term for converting to Roman Catholicism. A Catholic who converts to Protestantism, in particular Anglicanism, is referred to as \"swimming the Thames\" or \"crossing the Thames\".\nIn ancient Rome, executed criminals were thrown into the Tiber. People executed at the Gemonian stairs were thrown in the Tiber during the later part of the reign of the emperor Tiberius. This practice continued over the centuries. For example, the corpse of Pope Formosus was thrown into the Tiber after the infamous Cadaver Synod held in 897.\nBridges.\nIn addition to the numerous modern bridges over the Tiber in Rome, there remain a few ancient bridges (now mostly pedestrian-only) that have survived in part (e.g., the Ponte Milvio and the Ponte Sant'Angelo), or in whole (Pons Fabricius).\nIn addition to bridges, the Metro trains use tunnels.\nRepresentations.\nFollowing the standard Roman depiction of rivers as powerfully built reclining male gods, the Tiber, also interpreted as a god named Tiberinus, is shown with streams of water flowing from his hair and beard.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The franchise is currently owned by CDE Entertainment; it was formerly owned by Eidos Interactive, then by Square Enix Europe after Square Enix's acquisition of Eidos in 2009 until Embracer Group purchased the intellectual property alongside Eidos in 2022. The franchise focuses on the fictional British archaeologist Lara Croft, who travels around the world searching for lost artefacts and infiltrating dangerous tombs and ruins. Gameplay generally focuses on exploration, solving puzzles, navigating hostile environments filled with traps, and fighting enemies. Additional media has been developed for the franchise in the form of s, comics and novels.\nDevelopment of the first \"Tomb Raider\" video game began in 1994; it was released two years later. Its critical and commercial success prompted Core Design to develop a new game annually for the next four years, which put a strain on staff. The sixth game, \"\", faced difficulties during development and was considered a failure at release. This prompted Eidos to switch development duties to Crystal Dynamics, which has been the series' primary developer since. Other developers have contributed to spin-off titles and ports of mainline entries.\nThe \"Tomb Raider\" series had sold over 100 million units worldwide by 2024, while the entire franchise generated close to $1.2 billion in revenue by 2002. The series has received generally positive reviews from critics, and Lara Croft became one of the most recognisable video game characters, winning accolades and earning places on the Walk of Game and \"Guinness World Records\".\nTitles.\nThe first six \"Tomb Raider\" games were developed by Core Design, a British video game development company owned by Eidos Interactive. After the sixth game in the series was released to a mixed reception in 2003, development was transferred to American studio Crystal Dynamics, who have handled the main series since. Since 2001, other developers have contributed either to ports of mainline games or with the development of spin-off titles.\nMain series.\nOriginal series.\n\"Tomb Raider\", the first entry in the series, was released in 1996 for personal computers (PC), PlayStation and Sega Saturn consoles. The Saturn and PlayStation versions were released in Japan in 1997. Its sequel, \"Tomb Raider II\", launched in 1997, again for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation. A month before release, Eidos finalised a deal with Sony Computer Entertainment to keep the console version of \"Tomb Raider II\" and future games exclusive to PlayStation until the year 2000. The PlayStation version was released in Japan in 1998. \"Tomb Raider III\" launched in 1998. As with \"Tomb Raider II\", the PlayStation version released in Japan the following year.\nThe fourth consecutive title in the series, ', released in 1999. In 2000, with the end of the PlayStation exclusivity deal, the game also released on the Dreamcast. In Japan, both console versions released the following year. ' released in 2000 on the same platforms as \"The Last Revelation\", with the PlayStation version's Japanese release as before coming the following year. After a three-year gap, \"\" was released on Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 2 (PS2) in 2003. The PlayStation 2 version was released in Japan that same year.\n\"Legend\" trilogy.\nThe next entry, ', was released worldwide in 2006 for the Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, Xbox, Xbox 360, PlayStation Portable (PSP), GameCube, Game Boy Advance (GBA) and Nintendo DS. The Xbox 360, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable versions were released in Japan the same year. A year later, a remake of the first game titled ' was released worldwide in 2007 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Xbox 360 and the Wii. The next entry, \"\", was released in 2008 on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 (PS3), PlayStation 2, Xbox 360, Wii and DS. The PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2, Xbox 360 and Wii versions were released in Japan in 2009.\nIn 2011, \"The Tomb Raider Trilogy\" was released for PlayStation 3 as a compilation release that included \"Anniversary\" and \"Legend\" remastered in HD resolution, along with the PlayStation 3 version of \"Underworld\". The disc includes avatars for PlayStation Home, a Theme Pack, new Trophies, Developer's Diary videos for the three games, and trailers for \"Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light\" as bonus content.\n\"Survivor\" trilogy.\nA reboot of the series, titled \"Tomb Raider\", was released worldwide in 2013 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Its sequel, \"Rise of the Tomb Raider\", was released in 2015 on the Xbox 360 and Xbox One. The game was part of a timed exclusivity deal with Microsoft. Versions for the PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Windows were released in 2016. Another sequel, \"Shadow of the Tomb Raider\", was released worldwide on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows in 2018. An arcade game based on this incarnation was released by Bandai Namco Amusement in Europe in 2018.\nSpin-offs.\nGame Boy spin-offs.\nCore Design developed two Game Boy Color titles in the early 2000s. The first, a side-scrolling game simply titled \"Tomb Raider\" was released in 2000. The second, its sequel, ', was released in 2001. A Game Boy Advance title called ' was released in 2002. Unlike the first two Game Boy titles, this was developed by Ubi Soft Milan and published by Ubi Soft, adopting an isometric perspective and moving away from the side-scrolling platform-based gameplay.\n\"Lara Croft\" spin-offs.\nFrom 2010 to 2015, a subseries simply titled \"Lara Croft\" was in development at Crystal Dynamics, with different gameplay than the main series and existing in its own continuity. The first game, \"Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light\", was released in 2010 as a downloadable title for PC, PS3 and Xbox 360. It was followed by \"Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris\", released for retail and download in 2014 for PC, PS4 and Xbox One. Both titles were released in a compilation entitled \"The Lara Croft Collection\" for Nintendo Switch in 2023. An entry for mobile devices, an endless runner platformer titled \"\", was released in 2015. Square Enix Montreal also released a platform-puzzler for mobile devices, \"Lara Croft Go\" in 2015.\nOther spin-offs.\nIn 2003, four \"Tomb Raider\" titles for mobile phones were released. Developed by Emerald City Games for iOS and Android devices, \"Tomb Raider Reloaded\" is an action arcade and free-to-play game released by CDE Entertainment in 2022. A \"Tomb Raider\" themed downloadable content expansion for \"PowerWash Simulator\" was released for free on 31 January 2023.\nCancelled games.\nThe plans for the franchise following the release of \"Tomb Raider II\" in 1997 were heavily revised. Initially, an expansion disk was planned for \"II\" entitled \"The Further Adventures of Lara Croft\", which would have been set in India. Some engineering work was conducted for the PlayStation version to allow for a disk swap after launching the base game. A segment from issue 64 of \"GamesMaster\" informally referred to the expansion as \"Tomb Raider 2.5\" and stated that it would have seven levels. A full sequel, then billed as \"Tomb Raider III\" was planned to have a two-year development period and release on the PlayStation 2. This game would have had a remote island setting and a focus on survival, including a need to find food and water. Core Design developer Gavin Rummery has stated that the island setting would not have resembled the 2013 reboot, but rather have been \"self-contained\". Eidos was initially behind the plan but intended to maintain an annual release schedule, and therefore brought in a new team to handle \"The Further Adventures of Lara Croft\". Rummery objected on the grounds that splitting \"Tomb Raider\" out across multiple teams could lead to conflict between the projects, and has stated that it led him to \"eventually throw in the towel.\" Eidos pursued annual releases with the new team. The India setting from the expansion disk was adopted for \"Tomb Raider III\", a sequel for the original PlayStation, and the PlayStation 2 title was dropped. Rummery credits the failure of \"The Angel of Darkness\" in 2003 to burnout of the second team from annual releases, which stemmed from those directional changes in the late 1990s. The details were ultimately revealed by interviews with former staffers conducted for \"The Making of Tomb Raider\" in 2021.\nAfter the release of \"The Angel of Darkness\" in 2003, Core Design continued working on the franchise for another three years, but both of the projects under development in that period were cancelled. A sequel titled \"The Lost Dominion\" was undergoing preliminary development that year, but the negative reception of \"The Angel of Darkness\" caused it and a wider trilogy to be scrapped. With Eidos's approval, Core Design then began development of an updated edition of the first game for the PSP called \"Tomb Raider: 10th Anniversary\" in late 2005, with a projected release date of Christmas 2006. Development continued while other Core Design staff were working on the platformer \"Free Running\". When Core Design was sold to Rebellion Developments in June 2006, Eidos requested the project's cancellation. It was suggested by staff that Eidos did not want to let outside developers handle the franchise. An \"Indiana Jones\" \"reskin\" of the game was never completed, and \"Free Running\" was ultimately the studio's final title in 2007. Core Design\u2014by then named Rebellion Derby\u2014shut down in 2010. A January 2006 build of \"10th Anniversary\" was leaked online in 2020, and remains available on the Internet Archive.\nIn the mid-2000's TT Games produced a test animation of Lara Croft as a Lego minifigure. The studio felt the \"Tomb Raider\" series wasn\u2019t big enough for a standalone game, so the idea was pitched to Lucasfilm as a potential crossover with \"Indiana Jones.\" The pitch was immediately rejected, as Lucasfilm disliked the \"Tomb Raider\" series and believed it to be a knockoff of \"Indiana Jones\".\nCommon elements.\nLara Croft.\nLara Croft is the main protagonist and playable character of the video game series. She travels around the world in search of many forgotten artefacts and locations, frequently connected to supernatural powers. While her biography has changed throughout the series, her shared traits are her origins as the only daughter and heir of the aristocratic Croft family. She is portrayed as intelligent, athletic, elegant, fluent in multiple languages, and determined to fulfil her own goals at any cost. She has brown eyes and brown hair worn in a braid or ponytail. The character's classic outfit consists of a turquoise singlet, light brown shorts, calf-high boots, and tall white socks. Recurring accessories include fingerless gloves, a backpack, a utility belt with holsters on either side, and twin pistols. Later games have multiple new outfits for her.\nLara Croft has been voiced by five actresses in the video game series: Shelley Blond, Judith Gibbins, Jonell Elliott, Keeley Hawes, and Camilla Luddington. In other media, Croft was also voiced by Minnie Driver in the animated series and portrayed by Angelina Jolie and Alicia Vikander in feature films. Multiple models and body doubles have portrayed Croft in promotional material until the reboot in 2013. Eight different real-life models have portrayed her at promotional events.\nIn January 2023, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" reported that Phoebe Waller-Bridge was set to write a TV show adaptation of the video game franchise for Amazon. It was also reported that this would involve a tie-in video game and film in an interconnected universe, likened to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\nContinuity.\nThe circumstances of her first adventures, along with the drive behind her adventures, differ depending on the continuity. In the original continuities, she is on a plane that crashes in the Himalayas: her journey back to civilization against the odds help to begin her journey towards her adult life as an adventuress and treasure hunter. In the original continuity, after her ordeal in the Himalayas, she left behind her privileged life and made a living writing about her exploits as an adventurer, mercenary, and cat burglar. Shortly after these books she was disowned by her family. In \"The Last Revelation\", Lara was caught in a collapsing pyramid at the game's end, leaving her fate unknown: this was because the staff, exhausted from four years of non-stop development, wanted to move on from the character. \"Chronicles\" was told through a series of flashbacks at a wake for Lara, while \"The Angel of Darkness\" was set an unspecified time after \"The Last Revelation\", with Lara revealed to have survived. The circumstances of her survival were originally part of the game but were cut due to time constraints and the pushing of the publisher Eidos.\nIn the \"Legend\" continuity, her mother Amelia was involved in the crash, and she is partially driven by the need to discover the truth behind her mother's disappearance and vindicate her father's theories about Amelia's disappearance. This obsession with the truth is present in \"Anniversary\", and ends up bringing the world to the brink of destruction during the events of \"Underworld\". Her father is referred to as Lord Henshingly Croft in the original games and Lord Richard Croft in the \"Legend\" continuity. The \"Lara Croft\" subseries take place within their own separate continuity, devoting itself to adventures similar to earlier games while the main series goes in a different stylistic direction.\nIn the 2013 reboot continuity, Lara's mother vanished at an early age, and her father became obsessed with finding the secrets of immortality, eventually resulting in an apparent suicide. Lara distanced herself from her father's memory, believing like many others that his obsession had caused him to go mad. After studying at university, Lara gets an opportunity to work on an archaeology program, in the search for the mythic kingdom of Yamatai. The voyage to find the kingdom results in a shipwreck on an island, which is later discovered to be Yamatai, but the island is also home to savage bandits, who were victims of previous wrecks. Lara's attempts to find a way off the island lead her to discover that the island itself is stopping them from leaving, which she discovered is linked to the still-living soul of the Sun Queen Himiko. Lara tries to find a way to banish the spirit of the sun queen in order to get home. The aftermath of the events of the game causes Lara to see that her father was right, and that she had needlessly distanced herself from him. She decides to finish his work, and uncover the mysteries of the world. The game's sequels portray Lara Croft in conflict with an ancient organization Trinity, in their quest to obtain supernatural items for their world domination.\nGameplay.\nThe gameplay of \"Tomb Raider\" is primarily based around an action-adventure framework, with Lara navigating environments and solving mechanical and environmental puzzles, in addition to fighting enemies and avoiding traps. These puzzles, primarily set within ancient tombs and temples, can extend across multiple rooms and areas within a level. Lara can swim through water, a rarity in games at the time that has continued through the series. According to original software engineer and later studio manager Gavin Rummery, the original set-up of interlinking rooms was inspired by Egyptian multi-roomed tombs, particularly the tomb of Tutankhamun. The feel of the gameplay was intended to evoke that of the 1989 video game \"Prince of Persia\". In the original games, Lara utilised a \"bulldozer\" steering set-up, with two buttons pushing her forward and back and two buttons steering her left and right, and in combat Lara automatically locked onto enemies when they came within range. The camera automatically adjusts depending on Lara's action, but defaults to a third-person perspective in most instances. This basic formula remained unchanged through the first series of games. \"Angel of Darkness\" added stealth elements.\nFor \"Legend\", the control scheme and character movement was redesigned to provide a smooth and fluid experience. One of the key elements present was how buttons for different actions cleanly transitioned into different actions, along with these moves being incorporated into combat to create effects such as stunning or knocking down enemies. Quick-time events were added into certain segments within each level, and many of the puzzles were based around sophisticated in-game physics. \"Anniversary\", while going through the same locales of the original game, was rebuilt using the gameplay and environmental puzzles of \"Legend\". For \"Underworld\", the gameplay was redesigned around a phrase the staff had put to themselves: \"What Could Lara Do?\". Using this set-up, they created a greater variety of moves and greater interaction with the environment, along with expanding and improving combat.\nThe gameplay underwent another major change for the 2013 reboot. Gameplay altered from progression through linear levels to navigating an open world, with hunting for supplies and upgrading equipment and weapons becoming a key part of gameplay, yet tombs were mostly optional, and platforming was less present in comparison to combat. The combat was redesigned to be similar to the \"Uncharted\" series: the previous reticle-based lock-on mechanics were replaced by a free-roaming aim. \"Rise of the Tomb Raider\" built on the 2013 reboot's foundation, adding dynamic weather systems, reintroducing swimming, and increasing the prevalence of non-optional tombs with more platforming elements.\nHistory.\nOriginal series at Core Design (1994\u20132006).\nThe concept for \"Tomb Raider\" originated in 1994 at Core Design, a British game development studio. One of the people involved in its creation was Toby Gard, who was mostly responsible for creating the character of Lara Croft. Gard originally envisioned the character as a man: company co-founder Jeremy Heath-Smith was worried the character would be seen as derivative of Indiana Jones, so Gard changed the character's gender. Her design underwent multiple revisions and redrafts during early development. The game proved an unexpected commercial success, reversing Eidos' then-bleak financial situation. After the success of \"Tomb Raider\", work began on a sequel. Gard was no longer given creative control of the character, and it was stated by development staff that he was both saddened and disappointed by the use of Lara Croft's sex appeal in marketing. Gard left Core Design in 1997, alongside \"Tomb Raider\" co-creator Paul Douglas, to found their own gaming company Confounding Factor.\nThe remaining team members, alongside new arrivals, would work on the sequel \"Tomb Raider II\" which released a year after the original game and proved as big a commercial success. The development team were burned out by release due to the extreme crunch policy at Core Design. The vision for the franchise in late 1997 involved an expansion pack for \"Tomb Raider II\", entitled \"The Further Adventures of Lara Croft\", followed by a survival game called \"Tomb Raider III\" to be released two or three years later for the PlayStation 2. Eidos were initially behind this direction, but later were driven by a desire to have annual releases for the Christmas window. This led them to request that a second team be created to develop an expanded version of \"The Further Adventures\" and release that as \"Tomb Raider III\" in the interim. The decision was not communicated to the original team, which learned of the move only when \"Tomb Raider III\" was publicly announced as a 1998 title for the original PlayStation. They were exhausted and withdrew from the PlayStation 2 project in response, which was soon cancelled. The \"Tomb Raider II\" team did not work on the franchise again, with some team members going on to work on \"Project Eden\".\nGoing forwards the franchise would be worked on by the \"Tomb Raider III\" team, and in line with Eidos' vision for the franchise they would aim for annual releases. Core Design's policy at the time involved years-long crunch periods, which placed strain on them and ultimately led to similar burnout. For this reason, and the feeling that they had exhausted the series' potential, the team tried to kill off Lara at the end of the fourth game, \"The Last Revelation\". Eidos insisted that the series continue, and so \"Chronicles\" was developed by the Tomb Raider team while an additional group made preparations for the transition to PlayStation 2 with \"The Angel of Darkness\". The \"Chronicles\" team strongly disliked being forced to continue the franchise, with the lead animator enjoying creating new death animations for Lara on that basis. The game was poorly received, with reviewers suggesting the series was growing stale. During this period, multiple handheld titles were developed by both Core Design and third-party developers.\nThe production of \"The Angel of Darkness\" was beset by problems from an early stage, with the team wanting to create a grander game to compete with contemporary action-adventure games. When the \"Chronicles\" team came back over to work on \"The Angel of Darkness\", they found that production had completely \"gone off the rails\", with the entire project having been scrapped and restarted once already. Under pressure from Eidos, key sections of the game needed to be cut, and it was released before the team felt it was ready. It also suffered from crunch and burnout. The game received negative reactions from critics, and was cited by Paramount as the reason for the underperforming.\nWhile development of the next title \"Legend\" moved to Crystal Dynamics, Core Design continued to work on the franchise. A remake of the original game for PlayStation Portable was in development there, entitled \"10th Anniversary\". While Eidos had been averse to further \"Tomb Raider\" titles from the group, their recent purchase by SCi meant that the decision would now be made by the new parent company, and they were in favour. By 2006 the title was nearly finished, but after Crystal Dynamics sent a demo to SCi showing the first level of \"Legend\" running on PSP, \"10th Anniversary\" was cancelled and Crystal Dynamics were charged with remaking the original instead. One of the key reasons for this was the fact that Crystal Dynamics had stronger capabilities to do a cross-platform launch. The decision \"went down like a cup of cold sick\" at Core Design. The studio attempted to reskin the title as a \"National Treasure\" or \"Indiana Jones\" game in the wake of the decision, but these did not come to fruition. The loss of the \"Tomb Raider\" IP was a factor in the studio's closure several years later.\nCrystal Dynamics and \"Legend\" trilogy (2003\u20132008).\nAfter the critical backlash against \"The Angel of Darkness\", Eidos decided to take production of the \"Tomb Raider\" series out of Core Design's hands and give it to another subsidiary studio. Production of the next game was given to Crystal Dynamics in 2003, a studio that had made its name with the \"Legacy of Kain\" series. Eidos CEO Ian Livingstone stated that while the critical failure of \"The Angel of Darkness\" was a major reason for taking the series away from Core Design, the decision was motivated by their inordinate struggles with developing for the PlayStation 2, and by how many members of the Core team had complained that they were \"burnt out\" on \"Tomb Raider\". He added that \"for a UK company, moving the development of its prized asset from Derby to California was a big decision to make but, as it turned out, absolutely the right one to make\". One of the main priorities for both Eidos and Crystal Dynamics was to regain the fanbase's trust in the brand, along with helping the series reclaim the status and selling power it had before \"The Angel of Darkness\"' release. Their main goal was to put Lara back inside tombs, with their physics-based engine enabling more intricate puzzles. \"Legend\" was well received, and was the first game in a rebooted trilogy. After \"Legend\" was finished, the team decided to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the series by remaking the original game, rebuilding the environments and redesigning the story to fit in with the events and gameplay of \"Legend\". Alongside the development of \"Anniversary\", an entry for seventh-generation hardware was in development, although it used established gaming architecture from \"Legend\" and this caused problems for the development team. This released as \"\" in 2008.\nSquare Enix acquisition and \"Survivor\" trilogy (2009\u20132021).\nIn 2009, the year after the release of \"Underworld\", Eidos was bought by Square Enix and later renamed Square Enix Europe, giving Square Enix ownership of the \"Tomb Raider\" franchise. Development of Tomb Raider remained with Crystal Dynamics, now under the new structure. A new subseries began in 2010, billed simply as \"Lara Croft\" rather than \"Tomb Raider\" while using the aesthetics of the \"Legend\" continuity. The first of these was \"Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light\", followed by \"Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris\" in 2014. From 2015 the subseries aimed at the mobile format with \"\", and later \"Lara Croft Go\" which received critical acclaim.\nDuring this period, a second development team was working on a second reboot of the series and character, which put emphasis on a darker and grittier interpretation of the character. Another priority was presenting Lara as a more human character, putting her in vulnerable situations, and showing how she begins her journey to becoming a \"tomb raider\" through both narrative and gameplay. The reboot, simply entitled \"Tomb Raider\", was met with critical acclaim at launch in 2013, and became the start of the \"Survivor Trilogy\". A sequel, eventually revealed as \"Rise of the Tomb Raider\", was in development a few months after the reboot's release. In response to criticisms about a lack of classic tombs, more optional and story-based tombs were incorporated into the game. It continued the team's new portrayal of Lara, showing more sides to her character and her growing obsession with discovering the truth. In 2018, \"Shadow of the Tomb Raider\" was released to coincide with a new film starring Alicia Vikander as Lara Croft, simply titled \"Tomb Raider\", taking heavy inspiration from the 2013 game of the same name. \"Shadow\" was developed by Eidos-Montr\u00e9al as Crystal Dynamics completed \"Marvel's Avengers\", though Crystal would provide secondary support. The game concluded Lara's origin story. A \"Definitive Edition\", featuring all 7 DLCs for \"Shadow\" was released in November 2019.\nFollowing the conclusion of the Survivor trilogy, both Crystal Dynamics and Eidos-Montr\u00e9al were busy with Marvel properties, and so there were no further \"Tomb Raider\" games for several years. In Crystal Dynamics' case, continued support for \"Marvel's Avengers\" lasted until 2023. A great many crossovers with other video game franchises were also developed beginning in 2014 and continuing into the early 2020s, with an article from \"Fandom Wire\" identifying 14 franchises that received crossovers, ranging from \"Fall Guys\" to \"Dead by Daylight\". These were generally in the form of cosmetic additions or through Lara appearing as a playable character.\nEmbracer Group acquisition and re-releases (2022\u2013present).\nEmbracer Group purchased a number of Square Enix Europe assets in May 2022 for $, including Crystal Dynamics and the \"Tomb Raider\" franchise. The sale was for a comparatively low price, and was intended to fund Square Enix's disastrous pivot to NFT games in the early 2020s. Embracer announced the next main \"Tomb Raider\" title in 2022 as a game that would \"unify the timelines\", and combine elements from all three series, including the work of Core Design. In this timeline, Lara would be a seasoned adventurer. This instalment will use Unreal Engine 5, and will be published by Amazon Games. The mobile game \"Tomb Raider Reloaded\" was published by Square Enix London Mobile in 2023.\n\"Tomb Raider\" was only briefly under Embracer Group, as the company suffered from over-expansion and announced in 2024 that it was to split into three companies; the IP is to be held by Middle-earth Enterprises, under Fellowship Entertainment after the separation is completed.\nThe period also saw a number of re-releases in the form of collected editions and remasters. Feral Interactive's Lara Croft spin-offs were re-released as \"The Lara Croft Collection\" for Nintendo Switch in 2023. Aspyr released remasters of all six Core Design titles across two collections as \"Tomb Raider I\u2013III Remastered\" and \"Tomb Raider IV\u2013VI Remastered\" in 2024 and 2025. The remasters were made available for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. The Core Design games were also re-released in their original form for Evercade across two cartridges, with \"Tomb Raider Collection 1\" covering the first three games, and \"Tomb Raider Collection 2\" covering the fourth and fifth. The Evercade re-releases did not include \"The Angel of Darkness\".\nTelevision.\nIn 2021, Legendary Television and dj2 Entertainment announced an anime series set after the events of \"Shadow of the Tomb Raider\" for Netflix. The series' title was revealed as \"\" and it was released in October 2024. Season two is releasing, on Netflix, December 11, 2025, with Story Kitchen's Dmitri M. Johnson, Michael Lawrence Goldberg and Timothy I. Stevenson executive producing alongside Crystal Dynamics. A live-action series is currently also in pre-production at Amazon MGM Studios, announced in May 2024, with Phoebe Waller-Bridge as creator, writer, executive producer, and co-showrunner. Sophie Turner will take the role of Lara Croft, and with Story Kitchen's Dmitri M. Johnson, Michael Lawrence Goldberg and Timothy I. Stevenson executive producing.\nMusic.\nThe original \"Tomb Raider\" theme was composed by Nathan McCree. He created the original theme music after having discussions with Gard about the character of Lara Croft. Having decided to use Classical English music as an inspiration, he decided to create something simple for the theme song. Its simplicity made rearrangements and orchestrations easy. For his work on the first three \"Tomb Raider\" games, he was given fairly minimal briefs, and for \"Tomb Raider III\" he was working on the game as a freelancer as he had left the company. For \"The Last Revelation\", Peter Connelly replaced Nathan McCree as the main composer, using McCree's music as a basis for his work. He composed the opening theme for \"The Last Revelation\", saying that the opening melody came to him out of the blue, and added Egyptian motifs to fit in with the game's setting. \"Chronicles\" was originally going to have a sizeable original opening theme, but due to time constraints the majority of it ended up being discarded, much to Connelly's later regret. Only the opening segment survived. The music for \"The Angel of Darkness\", composed by Connelly and Martin Iveson, was the one element of production that did not encounter problems, as recording was finished before the major content cuts happened. Scored using a full orchestra as opposed to the synthesised instruments of previous titles, it was performed by the London Symphony Orchestra.\nFor \"Legend\", Troels Brun Folmann composed the music and managed the sound effects. Alongside composing a large amount of music for the game, he created micro-scores for small segments within gameplay. Folmann returned to score \"Anniversary\", doing re-orchestrations of the original score, along with expanding them. For \"Underworld\", Folmann handled the main theme while Colin O'Malley handled the rest of the soundtrack, which featured far less looping music than \"Legend\". The 2013 reboot was scored by Jason Graves, who had become known through his work on the \"Dead Space\" franchise. Along with his orchestral style, he created a special instrument to create discordant sounds within the music, and musical elements from around the globe to represent the inhabitants of the game's island location. For \"Rise of the Tomb Raider\", the composer was Bobby Tahouri, who had previously worked as assistant composer on video games and theatrical films. \"Guardian of Light\" used no original music, instead using extracts from the music of \"Legend\", \"Anniversary\" and \"Underworld\". The music for \"Temple of Osiris\" was written by Will Roget II, who had originally worked on licensed video games including \"\". \"Temple of Osiris\" was the first title in the \"Lara Croft\" subseries to have an original score, using Egyptian and Middle Eastern musical elements while creating a new main theme that could be used in future \"Lara Croft\" games.\nTechnology.\nOver the lifetime of the franchise, four custom proprietary game engines have been built to support the main titles. \"Shadow of the Tomb Raider\" (2018) was the final main series title to use a proprietary engine, as the franchise is now moving to Unreal Engine 5. The change reflects a wider industry shift in recent years away from proprietary engines.\nTomb Raider Engine (1994\u20132000).\nThe first \"Tomb Raider\" used a custom-built game engine, as other equivalent engines available to Core Design at the time were not versatile enough to realise the team's vision. The engine was designed by Paul Douglas, who handled the game's artificial intelligence (AI) and the three-dimensional (3D) graphics. The choice of a 3D game was influenced by the team's opinion that the game type was under-represented when compared to first-person shooters such as \"Doom\". Its 3D style meant multiple elements were difficult to implement, including the AI and camera control. Another noted aspect was the multi-layered levels, as compared to equivalent 3D action-adventure games of the time which were limited to a flat-floor system. Lara's movements were hand-animated and coordinated rather than created using motion capture. The reason for this was that the team wanted uniformity in her movement, which was not possible with motion capture technology of the time. For \"Tomb Raider II\", minor upgrades were made to the engine, with the main improvements being to the AI and smoothing out Lara's model. \"Tomb Raider III\" underwent major revisions, including rewrites to the graphics engine and improvements in the lighting and AI systems. The engine was given a major overhaul for \"The Last Revelation\". The first five games make use of full-motion video cutscenes. For the first three games, they were primarily used as transitional periods depicting Lara moving from one level to another or one location to another. For \"Chronicles\", fairly minor revisions were made.\nAngel of Darkness Engine (2000\u20132003).\nFor \"The Angel of Darkness\", a new engine was built from scratch, but due to being unfamiliar and unused to the technology of the PS2, the team encountered multiple problems such as needing to remove areas and characters due to polygon restrictions. Due to the deadlines imposed, the team were forced to cut corners, meaning that the game reached store shelves in a poor condition.\nCrystal Engine (2003\u20132008).\nFor \"Legend\", the staff at Crystal Dynamics created a proprietary engine from the ground up, named the Crystal Engine. The engine and the game's content were developed in parallel, leading to scheduling and workload difficulties. \"Anniversary\" used the same engine as \"Legend\". \"Underworld\" used a new engine built specifically for the game, although its basic codebase was shared with \"Legend\". The group of developers who were working on this new engine were not tied specifically to the \"Underworld\" project, but rather shared by other projects, and this led to issues of prioritisation and communication. There were also problems with complicated dependencies and over-ambition. In \"Underworld\", Lara's movements were animated using full motion capture, with Olympic gymnast Heidi Moneymaker providing the character's animations.\nFoundation Engine (2013\u20132019).\nFor the 2013 reboot, an updated version of the Crystal engine called Foundation was created for the game. Motion capture was again used for this title. An updated version of the Foundation engine was used again for \"Rise of the Tomb Raider\". Lara's hair movements were made more realistic using TressFX in \"Tomb Raider\" and PureHair in \"Rise of the Tomb Raider\". The Foundation engine remained in use for the third entry in the reboot series, \"Shadow of the Tomb Raider\", and featured new graphical enhancements from developer Eidos-Montr\u00e9al.\nCultural impact.\nBoth the character of Lara Croft and the concepts behind the \"Tomb Raider\" franchise have evolved thematically and in popularity since the first game's release in 1996. The success of the game series led to several commercial tie-ins that further catapulted to cultural icon status, including feature spin-off games, feature films, and comics.\nThe much anticipated album 'The Fat of the Land' by The Prodigy was apparently delayed by several months due to the band playing the game constantly over late 1996 and early 1997. The album would eventually be released in June 1997.\nReception.\nUpon release, \"Tomb Raider\" became an unexpected success, reaching the top of sales charts and remaining for a time. It went on to sell over 7 million units worldwide. \"Tomb Raider II\" was a greater commercial success, with debut sales higher than the first game and total worldwide sales of 8 million units. Despite varying critical receptions, series sales continued to be strong until the release of \"Chronicles\", which sold 1.5 million units. While \"The Angel of Darkness\" met with initial strong sales, it failed to meet expectations. Since the release of \"Legend\", the series has picked up in terms of sales, popularity, and critical acclaim. The 2013 reboot sold 11 million units, becoming the most commercially successful \"Tomb Raider\" title to date. By 2021, the series had sold over 85 million units worldwide. In addition to the games' success, the grossed $275 million, making it the highest-grossing video game adaptation until being overtaken in 2010 by \"\". Additionally, the first \"Tomb Raider\" comic book issue was the best-selling comic book of 1999 and the 2001 film adaptation had the biggest opening weekend (US$47.7m) for an action film with a female lead since \"Aliens\" in 1986.\nMultiple video game journalists, including \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\"'s Crispin Boyer in 1997 and Eurogamer's Martyn Carroll in 2008, have cited the series as a pioneer in the medium, both laying the foundations for and popularising action-adventure and platforming games. Carrol credited the series for bringing video gaming out into the cultural mainstream. In a different article, Eurogamer cited \"The Angel of Darkness\" as a pioneer of mixing different video game genres. The public's reactions to the series over the years have conversely had a profound effect upon the series' direction and identity, as noted in a 2008 review of the series' history by \"Develop\". In 2006, \"Tomb Raider\" was voted one of Britain's top 10 designs in the Great British Design Quest organised by the BBC and the Design Museum. The game appeared in a list of British design icons which included Concorde, Mini, World Wide Web, \"Grand Theft Auto\", K2 telephone box, London tube map, AEC Routemaster bus, and the Supermarine Spitfire. In 2020, \"Tomb Raider\" featured on a series of UK postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail to celebrate classic UK video games.\nThe character of Lara Croft has similarly enjoyed popularity, standing out during her initial appearance in the male-dominated video game market, and continuing to stand out throughout the series' history. After her debut in 1996, Lara Croft was featured on the front cover of British culture magazine \"The Face\", a position previously held by real-life celebrities. She similarly was featured in Irish rock band U2's PopMart Tour. The character was inducted onto the Walk of Game in 2006, and earned multiple mentions in the \"Guinness World Records\": she was recognised as the \"most successful human video game heroine\" in 2006, and earned six awards in 2010. As part of the latter honours, \"Guinness World Records\" editor Gaz Deaves said that the character \"epitomises all that's great about video gaming\". In an article for 1UP.com, Jeremy Parish said that Lara's sex appeal was the main draw for early fans, a facet Eidos exploited for marketing and attempted to emulate in other products. He cited other writers' statements that her popularity stemmed from player empathy with her ability to survive tough situations, alongside contrasting against weaker female characters such as Princess Peach. However, alongside this praise, she has divided opinion as to her character design and consequent sexuality: she is both hailed as an empowering figure for women and a negative role model due to her hyper-sexualized and unrealistic appearance."}

The lanthanide and actinide elements (the f-block) are called inner transition metals and are sometimes considered to be transition metals as well.\nThey are lustrous metals with good electrical and thermal conductivity. Most (with the exception of group 11 and group 12) are hard and strong, and have high melting and boiling temperatures. They form compounds in any of two or more different oxidation states and bind to a variety of ligands to form coordination complexes that are often coloured. They form many useful alloys and are often employed as catalysts in elemental form or in compounds such as coordination complexes and oxides. Most are strongly paramagnetic because of their unpaired d electrons, as are many of their compounds. All of the elements that are ferromagnetic near room temperature are transition metals (iron, cobalt and nickel) or inner transition metals (gadolinium).\nEnglish chemist Charles Rugeley Bury (1890\u20131968) first used the word \"transition\" in this context in 1921, when he referred to a \"transition series of elements\" during the change of an inner layer of electrons (for example \"n\"\u00a0=\u00a03 in the 4th row of the periodic table) from a stable group of 8 to one of 18, or from 18 to 32. These elements are now known as the d-block.\nDefinition and classification.\nThe 2011 IUPAC \"Principles of Chemical Nomenclature\" describe a \"transition metal\" as any element in groups 3 to 12 on the periodic table. This corresponds exactly to the d-block elements, and many scientists use this definition. In actual practice, the f-block lanthanide and actinide series are called \"inner transition metals\". The 2005 \"Red Book\" allows for the group 12 elements to be excluded, but not the 2011 \"Principles\".\nThe IUPAC \"Gold Book\" defines a transition metal as \"an element whose atom has a partially filled d sub-shell, or which can give rise to cations with an incomplete d sub-shell\", but this definition is taken from an old edition of the \"Red Book\" and is no longer present in the current edition.\nIn the d-block, the atoms of the elements have between zero and ten d electrons.\nPublished texts and periodic tables show variation regarding the heavier members of group 3. The common placement of lanthanum and actinium in these positions is not supported by physical, chemical, and electronic evidence, which overwhelmingly favour putting lutetium and lawrencium in those places. Some authors prefer to leave the spaces below yttrium blank as a third option, but there is confusion on whether this format implies that group 3 contains only scandium and yttrium, or if it also contains all the lanthanides and actinides; additionally, it creates a 15-element-wide f-block, when quantum mechanics dictates that the f-block should only be 14 elements wide. The form with lutetium and lawrencium in group 3 is supported by a 1988 IUPAC report on physical, chemical, and electronic grounds, and again by a 2021 IUPAC preliminary report as it is the only form that allows simultaneous (1) preservation of the sequence of increasing atomic numbers, (2) a 14-element-wide f-block, and (3) avoidance of the split in the d-block. Argumentation can still be found in the contemporary literature purporting to defend the form with lanthanum and actinium in group 3, but many authors consider it to be logically inconsistent (a particular point of contention being the differing treatment of actinium and thorium, which both can use 5f as a valence orbital but have no 5f occupancy as single atoms); the majority of investigators considering the problem agree with the updated form with lutetium and lawrencium.\nThe group 12 elements zinc, cadmium, and mercury are sometimes excluded from the transition metals. This is because they have the electronic configuration [\u00a0]d10s2, where the d shell is complete, and they still have a complete d shell in all their known oxidation states. The group 12 elements Zn, Cd and Hg may therefore, under certain criteria, be classed as post-transition metals in this case. However, it is often convenient to include these elements in a discussion of the transition elements. For example, when discussing the crystal field stabilization energy of first-row transition elements, it is convenient to also include the elements calcium and zinc, as both Ca2+ and Zn2+ have a value of zero, against which the value for other transition metal ions may be compared. Another example occurs in the Irving\u2013Williams series of stability constants of complexes. Moreover, Zn, Cd, and Hg can use their d orbitals for bonding even though they are not known in oxidation states that would formally require breaking open the d-subshell, which sets them apart from the p-block elements.\nThe 2007 (though disputed and so far not reproduced independently) synthesis of mercury(IV) fluoride (HgF4) has been taken by some to reinforce the view that the group 12 elements should be considered transition metals, but some authors still consider this compound to be exceptional. Copernicium is expected to be able to use its d electrons for chemistry as its 6d subshell is destabilised by strong relativistic effects due to its very high atomic number, and as such is expected to have transition-metal-like behaviour and show higher oxidation states than +2 (which are not definitely known for the lighter group 12 elements). Even in bare dications, Cn2+ is predicted to be 6d87s2, unlike Hg2+ which is 5d106s0.\nAlthough meitnerium, darmstadtium, and roentgenium are within the d-block and are expected to behave as transition metals analogous to their lighter congeners iridium, platinum, and gold, this has not yet been experimentally confirmed. Whether copernicium behaves more like mercury or has properties more similar to those of the noble gas radon is not clear. Relative inertness of Cn would come from the relativistically expanded 7s\u20137p1/2 energy gap, which is already adumbrated in the 6s\u20136p1/2 gap for Hg, weakening metallic bonding and causing its well-known low melting and boiling points.\nTransition metals with lower or higher group numbers are described as 'earlier' or 'later', respectively. When described in a two-way classification scheme, early transition metals are on the left side of the d-block from group 3 to group 7. Late transition metals are on the right side of the d-block, from group 8 to 11 (or 12, if they are counted as transition metals). In an alternative three-way scheme, groups 3, 4, and 5 are classified as early transition metals, 6, 7, and 8 are classified as middle transition metals, and 9, 10, and 11 (and sometimes group 12) are classified as late transition metals. \nThe heavy group 2 elements calcium, strontium, and barium do not have filled d-orbitals as single atoms, but are known to have d-orbital bonding participation in some compounds, and for that reason have been called \"honorary\" transition metals. The same is likely true of radium.\nThe f-block elements La\u2013Yb and Ac\u2013No have chemical activity of the (n\u22121)d shell, but importantly also have chemical activity of the (n\u22122)f shell that is absent in d-block elements. Hence they are often treated separately as inner transition elements.\nElectronic configuration.\nThe general electronic configuration of the d-block atoms is [noble gas](\"n\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a01)d0\u201310\"n\"s0\u20132\"n\"p0\u20131. Here \"[noble gas]\" is the electronic configuration of the last noble gas preceding the atom in question, and \"n\" is the highest principal quantum number of an occupied orbital in that atom. For example, Ti (\"Z\"\u00a0=\u00a022) is in period 4 so that \"n\" = 4, the first 18 electrons have the same configuration of Ar at the end of period 3, and the overall configuration is [Ar]3d24s2. The period 6 and 7 transition metals also add core (\"n\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a02)f14 electrons, which are omitted from the tables below. The p orbitals are almost never filled in free atoms (the one exception being lawrencium due to relativistic effects that become important at such high \"Z\"), but they can contribute to the chemical bonding in transition metal compounds.\nThe Madelung rule predicts that the inner d orbital is filled after the valence-shell s orbital. The typical electronic structure of transition metal atoms is then written as [noble gas]\"n\"s2(\"n\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a01)d\"m\". This rule is approximate, but holds for most of the transition metals. Even when it fails for the neutral ground state, it accurately describes a low-lying excited state.\nThe d subshell is the next-to-last subshell and is denoted as (\"n\" \u2212 1)d subshell. The number of s electrons in the outermost s subshell is generally one or two except palladium (Pd), with no electron in that s sub shell in its ground state. The s subshell in the valence shell is represented as the \"n\"s subshell, e.g. 4s. In the periodic table, the transition metals are present in ten groups (3 to 12).\nThe elements in group 3 have an \"n\"s2(\"n\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a01)d1 configuration, except for lawrencium (Lr): its 7s27p1 configuration exceptionally does not fill the 6d orbitals at all. The first transition series is present in the 4th period, and starts after Ca (\"Z\"\u00a0=\u00a020) of group 2 with the configuration [Ar]4s2, or scandium (Sc), the first element of group 3 with atomic number \"Z\"\u00a0=\u00a021 and configuration [Ar]4s23d1, depending on the definition used. As we move from left to right, electrons are added to the same d subshell till it is complete. Since the electrons added fill the (\"n\" \u2212 1)d orbitals, the properties of the d-block elements are quite different from those of s and p block elements in which the filling occurs either in s or in p orbitals of the valence shell.\nThe electronic configuration of the individual elements present in all the d-block series are given below:\nA careful look at the electronic configuration of the elements reveals that there are certain exceptions to the Madelung rule. For Cr as an example the rule predicts the configuration 3d44s2, but the observed atomic spectra show that the real ground state is 3d54s1. To explain such exceptions, it is necessary to consider the effects of increasing nuclear charge on the orbital energies, as well as the electron\u2013electron interactions including both Coulomb repulsion and exchange energy. The exceptions are in any case not very relevant for chemistry because the energy difference between them and the expected configuration is always quite low.\nThe (\"n\" \u2212 1)d orbitals that are involved in the transition metals are very significant because they influence such properties as magnetic character, variable oxidation states, formation of coloured compounds etc. The valence s and p orbitals (\"n\"s and \"n\"p) have very little contribution in this regard since they hardly change in the moving from left to the right in a transition series.\nIn transition metals, there are greater horizontal similarities in the properties of the elements in a period in comparison to the periods in which the d orbitals are not involved. This is because in a transition series, the valence shell electronic configuration of the elements do not change. However, there are some group similarities as well.\nCharacteristic properties.\nThere are a number of properties shared by the transition elements that are not found in other elements, which results from the partially filled d shell. These include\nMost transition metals can be bound to a variety of ligands, allowing for a wide variety of transition metal complexes.\nColoured compounds.\nColour in transition-series metal compounds is generally due to electronic transitions of two principal types.\nA metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transition will be most likely when the metal is in a low oxidation state and the ligand is easily reduced.\nIn general charge transfer transitions result in more intense colours than d\u2013d transitions.\nIn centrosymmetric complexes, such as octahedral complexes, d\u2013d transitions are forbidden by the Laporte rule and only occur because of vibronic coupling in which a molecular vibration occurs together with a d\u2013d transition. Tetrahedral complexes have somewhat more intense colour because mixing d and p orbitals is possible when there is no centre of symmetry, so transitions are not pure d\u2013d transitions. The molar absorptivity (\u03b5) of bands caused by d\u2013d transitions are relatively low, roughly in the range 5\u2013500 M\u22121cm\u22121 (where M = mol dm\u22123). Some d\u2013d transitions are spin forbidden. An example occurs in octahedral, high-spin complexes of manganese(II),\nwhich has a d5 configuration in which all five electrons have parallel spins; the colour of such complexes is much weaker than in complexes with spin-allowed transitions. Many compounds of manganese(II) appear almost colourless. The spectrum of [Mn(H2O)6]2+ shows a maximum molar absorptivity of about 0.04 M\u22121cm\u22121 in the visible spectrum.\nOxidation states.\nA characteristic of transition metals is that they exhibit two or more oxidation states, usually differing by one. For example, compounds of vanadium are known in all oxidation states between \u22121, such as [V(CO)6]-, and +5, such as VO43-.\nMain-group elements in groups 13 to 18 also exhibit multiple oxidation states. The \"common\" oxidation states of these elements typically differ by two instead of one. For example, compounds of gallium in oxidation states +1 and +3 exist in which there is a single gallium atom. Compounds of Ga(II) would have an unpaired electron and would behave as a free radical and generally be destroyed rapidly, but some stable radicals of Ga(II) are known. Gallium also has a formal oxidation state of +2 in dimeric compounds, such as [Ga2Cl6]2-, which contain a Ga-Ga bond formed from the unpaired electron on each Ga atom. Thus the main difference in oxidation states, between transition elements and other elements is that oxidation states are known in which there is a single atom of the element and one or more unpaired electrons.\nThe maximum oxidation state in the first row transition metals is equal to the number of valence electrons from titanium (+4) up to manganese (+7), but decreases in the later elements. In the second row, the maximum occurs with ruthenium (+8), and in the third row, the maximum occurs with iridium (+9). In compounds such as [MnO4]- and OsO4, the elements achieve a stable configuration by covalent bonding.\nThe lowest oxidation states are exhibited in metal carbonyl complexes such as Cr(CO)6 (oxidation state zero) and [Fe(CO)4]2- (oxidation state \u22122) in which the 18-electron rule is obeyed. These complexes are also covalent.\nIonic compounds are mostly formed with oxidation states +2 and +3. In aqueous solution, the ions are hydrated by (usually) six water molecules arranged octahedrally.\nMagnetism.\nTransition metal compounds are paramagnetic when they have one or more unpaired d electrons. In octahedral complexes with between four and seven d electrons both high spin and low spin states are possible. Tetrahedral transition metal complexes such as [FeCl4]2- are high spin because the crystal field splitting is small so that the energy to be gained by virtue of the electrons being in lower energy orbitals is always less than the energy needed to pair up the spins. Some compounds are diamagnetic. These include octahedral, low-spin, d6 and square-planar d8 complexes. In these cases, crystal field splitting is such that all the electrons are paired up.\nFerromagnetism occurs when individual atoms are paramagnetic and the spin vectors are aligned parallel to each other in a crystalline material. Metallic iron and the alloy alnico are examples of ferromagnetic materials involving transition metals. Antiferromagnetism is another example of a magnetic property arising from a particular alignment of individual spins in the solid state.\nCatalytic properties.\nThe transition metals and their compounds are known for their homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic activity. This activity is ascribed to their ability to adopt multiple oxidation states and to form complexes. Vanadium(V) oxide (in the contact process), finely divided iron (in the Haber process), and nickel (in catalytic hydrogenation) are some of the examples. Catalysts at a solid surface (nanomaterial-based catalysts) involve the formation of bonds between reactant molecules and atoms of the surface of the catalyst (first row transition metals utilize 3d and 4s electrons for bonding). This has the effect of increasing the concentration of the reactants at the catalyst surface and also weakening of the bonds in the reacting molecules (the activation energy is lowered). Also because the transition metal ions can change their oxidation states, they become more effective as catalysts.\nAn interesting type of catalysis occurs when the products of a reaction catalyse the reaction producing more catalyst (autocatalysis). One example is the reaction of oxalic acid with acidified potassium permanganate (or manganate (VII)). Once a little Mn2+ has been produced, it can react with MnO4\u2212 forming Mn3+. This then reacts with C2O4\u2212 ions forming Mn2+ again.\nPhysical properties.\nAs implied by the name, all transition metals are metals and thus conductors of electricity.\nIn general, transition metals possess a high density and high melting points and boiling points. These properties are due to metallic bonding by delocalized d electrons, leading to cohesion which increases with the number of shared electrons. However the group 12 metals have much lower melting and boiling points since their full d subshells prevent d\u2013d bonding, which again tends to differentiate them from the accepted transition metals. Mercury has a melting point of and is a liquid at room temperature.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

With a range of meaning in Chinese philosophy, translations of \"Tao\" include 'way', 'road', 'path', or 'technique', generally understood in the Taoist sense as an enigmatic process of transformation ultimately underlying reality. Taoist thought has informed the development of various practices within the Taoist tradition, ideation of mathematics and beyond, including forms of meditation, astrology, qigong, feng shui, and internal alchemy. A common goal of Taoist practice is self-cultivation, a deeper appreciation of the Tao, and more harmonious existence. Taoist ethics vary, but generally emphasize such virtues as \"effortless action\", \"naturalness\", \"simplicity\", and the three treasures of compassion, frugality, and humility.\nThe core of Taoist thought crystallized during the early Warring States period (c.\u2009450\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009300 BCE), during which the epigrammatic and the anecdotal \u2014widely regarded as the fundamental texts of Taoist philosophy\u2014were largely composed. They form the core of a body of Taoist writings accrued over the following centuries, which was assembled by monks into the canon starting in the 5th century CE. Early Taoism drew upon diverse influences, including the Shang and Zhou state religions, Naturalism, Mohism, Confucianism, various Legalist theories, as well as the and \"Spring and Autumn Annals\".\nTaoism and Confucianism developed significant differences. Taoism emphasizes naturalness and spontaneity in human experience, whereas Confucianism regards social institutions\u2014family, education, community, and the state\u2014as essential to human flourishing and moral development. Nonetheless, they are not seen as mutually incompatible or exclusive, sharing many views toward \"humanity, society, the ruler, heaven, and the universe\". The relationship between Taoism and Buddhism upon the latter's introduction to China is characterized as one of mutual influence, with long-running discourses shared between Taoists and Buddhists; the distinct Mahayana tradition of Zen that emerged during the Tang dynasty (618\u2013907) incorporates many ideas from Taoism.\nMany Taoist denominations recognize deities, often ones shared with other traditions, which are venerated as superhuman figures exemplifying Taoist virtues. They can be roughly divided into two categories of \"gods\" and (or \"immortals\"). were immortal beings with vast supernatural powers, also describing a principled, moral person. Since Taoist thought is syncretic and deeply rooted in Chinese culture for millennia, it is often unclear which denominations should be considered \"Taoist\".\nThe title (\"Taoist master\") is traditionally reserved for ordained clergy within Taoist organizations, who distinguish their formal traditions from those of Chinese folk religion. Though generally lacking motivation for strong hierarchies, Taoist philosophy has often served as a theoretical foundation for politics, warfare, and Taoist organizations. Taoist secret societies precipitated the Yellow Turban Rebellion during the late Han dynasty, attempting to create what has been characterized as a Taoist theocracy.\nToday, Taoism is one of five religious doctrines officially recognized by the Chinese government, also having official status in Hong Kong and Macau. It is considered a major religion in Taiwan, and also has significant populations of adherents throughout the Sinosphere and Southeast Asia. In the West, Taoism has taken on various forms, both those hewing to historical practice, as well as highly synthesized practices variously characterized as new religious movements.\nTerminology.\nSpelling.\n\"Tao\" and \"Dao\" are different Romanized spellings of the same Chinese word: \u9053.\nStandard Chinese and English pronunciation.\nThe Standard Chinese pronunciation of \u9053 is . Neither an English pronunciation like (an English pronunciation of \"Dao\") nor an English pronunciation like (an English pronunciation of \"Tao\") is the same as the Standard Chinese pronunciation of \u9053, whose initial consonant is neither voiced nor aspirated.\nThese differences in the initial consonants used in English and Standard Chinese may contribute to there being different methods of Romanizing Chinese, which consequently may confuse English speakers when encountering both \"Tao\" and \"Dao\" spellings for the same Chinese term.\nOne authority calls the pronunciation with a \u27e8t\u27e9 as in \"tie\" (with a ) to be a \"mispronunciation\" originally caused by the \"clumsy Wade\u2013Giles system\", which misled most readers. Standard Chinese phonology does not have the same sound inventory as English phonology; the Wade\u2013Giles romanization system provides spellings in the Latin alphabet, but they are not meant to indicate an exact English pronunciation in the same way as though they were English words.\nClassification.\nThe word \"Taoism\" is used to translate two related but distinct Chinese terms.\nThe distinction between Taoism in \"philosophy\" and Taoist \"religion\" is an ancient, deeply-rooted one. Taoism as a positive philosophy aims for the holistic unification of an individual's reality with everything that is not only real but also valuable, encompassing both the natural world and society. But the earliest references to 'the Tao' per se are largely devoid of liturgical or explicitly supernatural character, used in contexts either of abstract metaphysics or of the ordinary conditions required for human flourishing. This distinction is still understood in everyday contexts among Chinese people, echoed by early modern scholars of Chinese history and philosophy such as Feng Youlan and Wing-tsit Chan. Use of the term \"daojia\" dates to the Western Han c.\u2009100 BCE, referring to the purported authors of the emerging Taoist canon, such as Lao Dan and Zhuang Zhou.\nNeither the \"Tao Te Ching\" and \"Zhuangzi\" themselves, or the early secondary sources written about them, put forward any particular supernatural ontology. Nonetheless, that religious Taoism emerged from a synthesis of folk religion with philosophical Taoist precepts is clear. The earlier, naturalistic was employed by pre-Han and Han thinkers, and continued to be used well into the Song, including among those who explicitly rejected cults, both private and state-sanctioned, that were often either labeled or self-identified as Taoist.\nHowever, this distinction has been challenged or rejected by some scholars of religion, often those from a Western or Japanese background, who often use distinct interpretive models and techniques. This point of view characterizes the religious and philosophical characteristics of the Taoist tradition as being inseparable. Sinologists such as Isabelle Robinet and Livia Kohn state that \"Taoism has never been a unified religion, and has constantly consisted of a combination of teachings based on a variety of original revelations.\" The distinction is fraught with hermeneutic difficulties when attempting to categorize different schools, sects, and movements. Russell Kirkland writes that \"most scholars who have seriously studied Taoism, both in Asia and in the West\" have abandoned this \"simplistic dichotomy\". Louis Komjathy writes that this is an untenable misconception because \"the association of \"daojia\" with \"thought\" (\"sixiang\") and of \"daojiao\" with \"religion\" (\"zongjiao\") is a modern Chinese construction largely rooted in earlier Chinese literati, European colonialist, and Protestant missionary interpretations. Contemporaneous Neo-Confucianists, for example, often self-identify as Taoist without partaking in any rituals.\nIn contrast, Komjathy characterizes Taoism as \"a unified religious tradition characterized by complexity and diversity\", arguing that historically, none of these terms were understood according to a bifurcated 'philosophy' versus 'religion' model. \"Daojia\" was a taxonomical category for Taoist texts, that was eventually applied to Taoist movements and priests in the early medieval period. Meanwhile, \"daojiao\" was originally used to specifically distinguish Taoist tradition from Buddhism. Thus, \"daojiao\" included \"daojia\". Komjathy notes that the earliest Taoist texts also \"reveal a religious community composed of master-disciple lineages\", and therefore, that \"Taoism was a religious tradition from the beginning.\" Philosopher Chung-ying Cheng likewise views Taoism as a religion embedded into Chinese history and tradition, while also assuming many different \"forms of philosophy and practical wisdom\". Chung-ying Cheng also noted that the Taoist view of 'heaven' mainly from \"observation and meditation, [though] the teaching of [the Tao] can also include the way of heaven independently of human nature\". Taoism is generally not understood as a variant of Chinese folk religion per se: while the two umbrella terms have considerable cultural overlap, core themes of both also diverge considerably from one another.\nAdherents.\nTraditionally, the Chinese language does not have terms defining lay people adhering to the doctrines or the practices of Taoism, who fall instead within the field of folk religion. Taoist, in Western sinology, is traditionally used to translate \"daoshi/taoshih\" (), thus strictly defining the priests of Taoism, ordained clergymen of a Taoist institution who \"represent Taoist culture on a professional basis\", are experts of Taoist liturgy, and therefore can employ this knowledge and ritual skill for the benefit of a community.\nThis role of Taoist priests reflects the definition of Taoism as a \"liturgical framework for the development of local cults\", in other words a scheme or structure for Chinese religion, proposed first by the scholar and Taoist initiate Kristofer Schipper in \"The Taoist Body\" (1986). \"Taoshi\" are comparable to the non-Taoist ritual masters () of vernacular traditions (the so-called Faism) within Chinese religion.\nThe term (), with the meaning of \"Taoist\" as \"lay member or believer of Taoism\", is a modern invention that goes back to the introduction of the Western category of \"organized religion\" in China in the 20th century, but it has no significance for most of Chinese society in which Taoism continues to be an \"order\" of the larger body of Chinese religion.\nHistory.\nClassical Taoism and its sources.\nScholars like Harold Roth argue that early Taoism was a series of \"inner-cultivation lineages\" of master-disciple communities, emphasizing a contentless and nonconceptual apophatic meditation as a way of achieving union with the Tao. According to Louis Komjathy, their worldview \"emphasized the Dao as sacred, and the universe and each individual being as a manifestation of the Dao.\" These communities were also closely related to and intermixed with the fangshi (method master) communities. Other scholars, like Russell Kirkland, argue that before the Han dynasty, there were no real \"Taoists\" or \"Taoism\". Instead, there were various sets of behaviors, practices, and interpretative frameworks (like the ideas of the \"Yijing\", yin-yang thought, as well as Mohist, \"Legalist\", and \"Confucian\" ideas), which were eventually synthesized into the first organized forms of \"Taoism\".\nSome of the main early Taoist sources include: the \"Neiye\", the \"Zhuangzi\", and the \"Tao Te Ching\". The \"Tao Te Ching\", attributed to Laozi, is dated by scholars to sometime between the 4th and 6th century BCE. A common tradition holds that Laozi founded Taoism. Laozi's historicity is disputed, with many scholars seeing him as a legendary founding figure.\nWhile Taoism is often regarded in the West as arising from Laozi, many Chinese Taoists claim that the Yellow Emperor formulated many of their precepts, including the quest for \"long life\". Traditionally, the Yellow Emperor's founding of Taoism was said to have been because he \"dreamed of an ideal kingdom whose tranquil inhabitants lived in harmonious accord with the natural law and possessed virtues remarkably like those espoused by early Taoism. On waking from his dream, Huangdi sought to\" bring about \"these virtues in his own kingdom, to ensure order and prosperity among the inhabitants\".\nAfterwards, Taoism developed and grew into two sects; One is Zhengyi Taoism, which mainly focuses on spells, and the other is Quanzhen Taoism, which mainly focuses on practicing inner alchemy. Overall, traditional Taoist thought, content, and sects are varied, reflecting the ideal of \"absorbing everything inside and mixing everything outside\".\nEarly Taoism drew on the ideas found in the religion of the Shang dynasty and the Zhou dynasty, such as their use of divination, ancestor worship, and the idea of Heaven (Tian) and its relationship to humanity. According to modern scholars of Taoism, such as Kirkland and Livia Kohn, Taoist philosophy also developed by drawing on numerous schools of thought from the Warring States period (4th to 3rd centuries BCE), including Mohism, Confucianism, Legalist theorists (like Shen Buhai and Han Fei, which speak of \"wu wei\"), the School of Naturalists (from which Taoism draws its main cosmological ideas, yin and yang and the five phases), and the Chinese classics, especially the \"I Ching\" and the \"L\u00fcshi Chunqiu\".\nMeanwhile, Isabelle Robinet identifies four components in the emergence of Taoism: the teachings found in the \"Tao Te Ching\" and \"Zhuangzi,\" techniques for achieving ecstasy, practices for achieving longevity and becoming an immortal (xian), and practices for exorcism. Robinet states that some elements of Taoism may be traced to prehistoric folk religions in China. In particular, many Taoist practices drew from the Warring States era phenomena of the \"wu\" (Chinese shamans) and the \"fangshi\" (\"method masters\", which probably derived from the \"archivist-soothsayers of antiquity\").\nBoth terms were used to designate individuals dedicated to \"magic, medicine, divination,\u00a0... methods of longevity and to ecstatic wanderings\" as well as exorcism. The \"fangshi\" were philosophically close to the School of Naturalists and relied greatly on astrological and calendrical speculations in their divinatory activities. Female shamans played an important role in the early Taoist tradition, which was particularly strong in the southern state of Chu. Early Taoist movements developed their own tradition in contrast to shamanism while also absorbing shamanic elements.\nDuring the early period, some Taoists lived as hermits or recluses who did not participate in political life, while others sought to establish a harmonious society based on Taoist principles. Zhuang Zhou (c. 370\u2013290 BCE) was the most influential of the Taoist hermits. Some scholars hold that since he lived in the south, he may have been influenced by Chinese shamanism. Zhuang Zhou and his followers insisted they were the heirs of ancient traditions and the ways of life of by-then legendary kingdoms. Pre-Taoist philosophers and mystics whose activities may have influenced Taoism included shamans, naturalists skilled in understanding the properties of plants and geology, diviners, early environmentalists, tribal chieftains, court scribes and commoner members of governments, members of the nobility in Chinese states, and the descendants of refugee communities.\nSignificant movements in early Taoism disregarded the existence of gods, and many who believed in gods thought they were subject to the natural law of the Tao, in a similar nature to all other life. Roughly contemporaneously to the \"Tao Te Ching\", some believed the Tao was a force that was the \"basis of all existence\" and more powerful than the gods, while being a god-like being that was an ancestor and a mother goddess.\nEarly Taoists studied the natural world in attempts to find what they thought were supernatural laws that governed existence. Taoists created scientific principles that were the first of their kind in China, and the belief system has been known to merge scientific, philosophical, and religious conceits from close to its beginning.\nEarly organized Taoism.\nBy the Han dynasty (206 BCE\u2013220 CE), the various sources of Taoism had coalesced into a coherent tradition of ritualists in the state of Shu (modern Sichuan). One of the earliest forms of Taoism was the Han era (2nd century BCE) \"Huang\u2013Lao\" movement, which was an influential school of thought at this time. The \"Huainanzi\" and the \"Taipingjing\" are important sources from this period. An unorganized form of Taoism was popular in the Han dynasty that syncretized many preexisting forms in multiple ways for different groups existed during a rough span of time throughout the 2nd century BCE. Also during the Han, the earliest extant commentaries on the \"Tao Te Ching\" were written: the Heshang Gong commentary and the Xiang'er commentary.\nThe first organized form of Taoism was the Way of the Celestial Masters, which developed from the Five Pecks of Rice movement at the end of the 2nd century CE. The latter had been founded by Zhang Daoling, who was said to have had a vision of Laozi in 142 CE and claimed that the world was coming to an end. Zhang sought to teach people to repent and prepare for the coming cataclysm, after which they would become the seeds of a new era of great peace. It was a mass movement in which men and women could act as libationers and tend to the commoners. A related movement arose in Shandong called the \"Way of Great Peace\", seeking to create a new world by replacing the Han dynasty. This movement led to the Yellow Turban Rebellion, and after years of bloody war, they were crushed.\nThe Celestial Masters movement survived this period and did not take part in attempting to replace the Han. As such, they grew and became an influential religion during the Three Kingdoms period, focusing on ritual confession and petition, as well as developing a well-organized religious structure. The Celestial Masters school was officially recognized by the warlord Cao Cao in 215 CE, legitimizing Cao Cao's rise to power in return. Laozi received imperial recognition as a divinity in the mid-2nd century BCE.\nAnother important early Taoist movement was Taiqing (Great Clarity), which was a tradition of external alchemy (\u5916\u4e39) that sought immortality through the concoction of elixirs, often using toxic elements like cinnabar, lead, mercury, and realgar, as well as ritual and purificatory practices.\nAfter this point, Taoism did not have nearly as significant an effect on the passing of law as the syncretic Confucian\u2013Legalist tradition.\nThree Kingdoms and Six Dynasties eras.\nThe Three Kingdoms period saw the rise of the Xuanxue (Mysterious Learning or Deep Wisdom) tradition, which focused on philosophical inquiry and integrated Confucian teachings with Taoist thought. The movement included scholars like Wang Bi (226\u2013249), He Yan (d. 249), Xiang Xiu (223?\u2013300), Guo Xiang (d. 312), and Pei Wei (267\u2013300). Another later influential figure was the 4th century alchemist Ge Hong, who wrote a key Taoist work on inner cultivation, the \"Baopuzi\" (\"Master Embracing Simplicity\").\nThe Six Dynasties (316\u2013589) era saw the rise of two new Taoist traditions, the Shangqing and Lingbao schools. Shangqing was based on a series of revelations by gods and spirits to a certain Yang Xi between 364 and 370. As Livia Kohn writes, these revelations included detailed descriptions of the heavens as well as \"specific methods of shamanic travels or ecstatic excursions, visualizations, and alchemical concoctions\". The Shangqing revelations also introduced many new Taoist scriptures.\nSimilarly, between 397 and 402, Ge Chaofu compiled a series of scriptures that later served as the foundation of the Lingbao school, which was most influential during the later Song dynasty (960\u20131279) and focused on scriptural recitation and the use of talismans for harmony and longevity. The Lingbao school practiced purification rituals called \"purgations\" in which talismans were empowered. Lingbao also adopted Mahayana Buddhist elements. According to Kohn, they \"integrated aspects of Buddhist cosmology, worldview, scriptures, and practices, and created a vast new collection of Taoist texts in close imitation of Buddhist sutras\". Louis Komjathy also notes that they adopted the Mahayana Buddhist universalism in its promotion of \"universal salvation\" (pudu).\nDuring this period, Louguan, the first Taoist monastic institution (influenced by Buddhist monasticism) was established in the Zhongnan mountains by a local Taoist master named Yin Tong. This tradition was called the Northern Celestial masters, and their main scripture was the \"Xisheng jing\" (\"Scripture of Western Ascension\").\nDuring the sixth century, Taoists attempted to unify the various traditions into one integrated Taoism that could compete with Buddhism and Confucianism. To do this they adopted the schema known as the \"three caverns\", first developed by the scholar Lu Xiujing (406\u2013477) based on the \"three vehicles\" of Buddhism. The three caverns were: Perfection (Dongzhen), associated with the Three Sovereigns; Mystery (Dongxuan), associated with Lingbao; and Spirit (Dongshen), associated with the Supreme Clarity tradition. Lu Xiujing also used this schema to arrange the Taoist scriptures and Taoist deities. Lu Xiujing worked to compile the first edition of the \"Daozang\" (the Taoist Canon), which was published at the behest of the Chinese emperor. Thus, according to Russell Kirkland, \"in several important senses, it was really Lu Hsiu-ching who founded Taoism, for it was he who first gained community acceptance for a common canon of texts, which established the boundaries, and contents, of 'the teachings of the Tao' (Tao-chiao). Lu also reconfigured the ritual activities of the tradition, and formulated a new set of liturgies, which continue to influence Taoist practice to the present day.\"\nThis period also saw the development of the Three Pure Ones, which merged the high deities from different Taoist traditions into a common trinity that has remained influential until today.\nLater imperial dynasties.\nThe new Integrated Taoism, now with a united Taoist identity, gained official status in China during the Tang dynasty. This tradition was termed \"daojiao\" (the teaching of the Tao). The Tang was the height of Taoist influence, during which Taoism, led by the Patriarch of Supreme Clarity, was the dominant religion in China. According to Russell Kirkland, this new Taoist synthesis had its main foundation in the Lingbao school's teachings, which was appealing to all classes of society and drew on Mahayana Buddhism.\nPerhaps the most important figure of the Tang was the court Taoist and writer Du Guangting (850\u2013933). Du wrote numerous works about Taoist rituals, history, myth, and biography. He also reorganized and edited the \"Taotsang\" after a period of war and loss.\nDuring the Tang, several emperors became patrons of Taoism, inviting priests to court to conduct rituals and enhance the prestige of the sovereign. The Gaozong Emperor even decreed that the \"Tao Te Ching\" was to be a topic in the imperial examinations. During the reign of the 7th century Emperor Taizong, the Five Dragons Temple (the first temple at the Wudang Mountains) was constructed. Wudang would eventually become a major center for Taoism and a home for Taoist martial arts (Wudang quan).\nEmperor Xuanzong (r. 712\u2013755) was also a devoted Taoist who wrote various Taoist works, and according to Livia Kohn, \"had frequent meetings with senior masters, ritual specialists, Taoist poets, and official patriarchs, such as Sima Chengzhen.\" He reorganized imperial rituals based on Taoist forms, sponsored Taoist shrines and monasteries, and introduced a separate examination system based on Taoism. Another important Taoist figure of the Tang dynasty was Lu Dongbin, who is considered the founder of the jindan meditation tradition and an influential figure in the development of neidan (internal alchemy) practice.\nLikewise, several Song dynasty emperors, most notably Huizong, were active in promoting Taoism, collecting Taoist texts, and publishing updated editions of the \"Daozang\". The Song era saw new scriptures and new movements of ritualists and Taoist rites, the most popular of which were the Thunder Rites (leifa). The Thunder rites were protection and exorcism rites that evoked the celestial department of thunder, and they became central to the new Heavenly Heart (Tianxin) tradition as well as for the Youthful Incipience (Tongchu) school.\nIn the 12th century, the Quanzhen (Complete Perfection) School was founded in Shandong by the sage Wang Chongyang (1113\u20131170) to compete with religious Taoist traditions that worshipped \"ghosts and gods\" and largely displaced them. The school focused on inner transformation, mystical experience, monasticism, and asceticism. Quanzhen flourished during the 13th and 14th centuries and during the Yuan dynasty. The Quanzhen school was syncretic, combining elements from Buddhism and Confucianism with Taoist tradition. According to Wang Chongyang, the \"three teachings\" (Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism), \"when investigated, prove to be but one school\". Quanzhen became the largest and most important Taoist school in China when master Qiu Chuji met with Genghis Khan who ended up making him the leader of all Chinese religions as well as exempting Quanzhen institutions from taxation. Another important Quanzhen figure was Zhang Boduan, author of the \"Wuzhen pian\", a classic of internal alchemy, and the founder of the southern branch of Quanzhen.\nDuring the Song era, the Zhengyi Dao tradition properly developed in Southern China among Taoists of the Chang clan. This liturgically focused tradition would continue to be supported by later emperors and survives to this day.\nIn the Yuan dynasty, Taoism in Northern China took inspiration from Tibetan cultural practices, Chinese folk religion (often from the western parts of the Yuan dynasty's land), and Tibetan Buddhism.\nUnder the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644), aspects of Confucianism, Taoism, and East Asian Buddhism were consciously synthesized in the Neo-Confucian school, which eventually became Imperial orthodoxy for state bureaucratic purposes. Taoist ideas also influenced Neo-Confucian thinkers like Wang Yangming and Zhan Ruoshui. During the Ming, the legends of the Eight Immortals (the most important of which is L\u00fc Dongbin) rose to prominence, being part of local plays and folk culture. Ming emperors like the Hongwu Emperor continued to invite Taoists to court and hold Taoist rituals that were believed to enhance the power of the throne. The most important of these were connected with the Taoist deity Xuanwu (\"Perfect Warrior\"), which was the main dynastic protector deity of the Ming.\nThe Ming era saw the rise of the Jingming (\"Pure Illumination\") school to prominence, which merged Taoism with Buddhist and Confucian teachings and focused on \"purity, clarity, loyalty and filial piety\". The school derided internal and external alchemy, fasting (bigu), and breathwork. Instead, the school focused on using mental cultivation to return to the mind's original purity and clarity (which could become obscured by desires and emotions). Key figures of this school include Xu Xun, Liu Yu, Huang Yuanji, Xu Yi, and Liu Yuanran. Some of these figures taught at the imperial capital and were awarded titles. Their emphasis on practical ethics and self-cultivation in everyday life (rather than ritual or monasticism) made it very popular among the literati class.\nThe Qing dynasty (1644\u20131912) mainly promoted Buddhism as well as Neo-Confucianism. Thus, during this period, the status and influence of Taoism declined. During the 18th century, the Qing imperial library excluded virtually all Taoist books.\nThe Qing era also saw the birth of the Longmen (\"Dragon Gate\" ) school of Wang Kunyang (1552\u20131641), a branch of Quanzhen from southern China that became established at the White Cloud Temple. Longmen authors like Liu Yiming (1734\u20131821) and Min Yide (1758\u20131836) worked to promote and preserve Taoist inner alchemy practices through books like \"The Secret of the Golden Flower\". The Longmen school synthesized the Quanzhen and neidan teachings with the Chan Buddhist and Neo-Confucian elements that the Jingming tradition had developed, making it widely appealing to the literati class.\nEarly modern Taoism.\nDuring the 19th and 20th centuries, Taoism suffered much destruction as a result of religious persecution and numerous wars and conflicts that beset China in the so-called century of humiliation. This period of persecution was caused by numerous factors including Confucian prejudices, anti-traditional Chinese modernist ideologies, European and Japanese colonialism, and Christian missionary activity. By the 20th century, only one complete copy of the Tao Tsang survived intact, stored at the White Cloud Monastery in Beijing. A key Taoist figure during this period was Chen Yingning (1880\u20131969). He was a key member of the early Chinese Taoist Association and wrote numerous books promoting Taoist practice.\nDuring the Cultural Revolution (1966\u20131976), many Taoist priests were laicized and sent to work camps, and many Taoist sites and temples were destroyed or converted to secular use. This period saw an exodus of Taoists out of China. They immigrated to Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and to Europe and North America. Thus, the communist repression had the consequence of making Taoism a world religion by disseminating Taoists throughout the world.\nIn the 1910s, Taoist doctrine about immortals and waiting until after death to live in \"the dwelling of the immortals\" was one of the faith's most popular and influential beliefs.\nThe 20th century was also a creative period for Taoism despite its many setbacks. The Taoist influenced practice of tai chi developed during this time, led by figures like Yang Chengfu and Sun Lutang. Early proponents of tai chi, like Sun Lutang, claimed that it was a Taoist internal practice created by the Taoist immortal Zhang Sanfeng (though modern scholars note that this claim lacks credible historical evidence).\nLate modern Taoism.\nTaoism began to recover during the reform and opening up period (beginning in 1979) during which mainland China experienced increased religious freedom. This led to the restoration of many temples and communities, the publishing of Taoist literature and the preservation of Taoist material culture. Several Chinese intellectuals, like Hu Fuchen (Chinese Academy of Social Studies) and Liu Xiaogan (Chinese University of Hong Kong) have worked to developed a \"New Daojia\" (\"xin daojia\"), which parallels the rise of New Confucianism.\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, China experienced the so-called Qigong fever, which saw a surge in the popularity of Qigong practice throughout China. During this period many new Taoist and Taoist influenced religions sprung up, the most popular being those associated with Qigong, such as Zangmigong (Tantric Qigong influenced by Tibetan Buddhism), Zhonggong (Central Qigong), and Falungong (which came to be outlawed and repressed by the Chinese Communist Party [CCP]).\nToday, Taoism is one of five official recognized religions in the People's Republic of China. In mainland China, the government regulates its activities through the Chinese Taoist Association. Regarding the status of Taoism in mainland China, Livia Kohn writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Taoist institutions are state-owned, monastics are paid by the government, several bureaus compete for revenues and administrative power, and training centers require courses in Marxism as preparation for full ordination. Still, temple compounds are growing on the five sacred mountains, on Taoist mountains, and in all major cities.\nThe White Cloud Temple at Beijing remains the most important center for the training of Taoist monastics on the mainland, while the five sacred mountains of China also contain influential Taoist centers. Other key sites include: Wudangshan, Mount Longhu, Mount Qiyun, Mount Qingcheng, Mount Tai, Zhongnan mountains, Mount Mao, and Mount Lao. Meanwhile, Taoism is also practiced much more freely in Taiwan and Hong Kong, where it is a major religion and retains unique features and movements that differ from mainland Taoism. Taoism is also practiced throughout the wider East Asian cultural sphere.\nOutside of China, many traditionally Taoist practices have spread, especially through Chinese emigration as well as conversion by non-Chinese. Taoist influenced practices, like tai chi and qigong, are also popular around the world. Its influence is ubiquitous, especially in divination and magical practices. As such, Taoism is now a religion with a global distribution.\nTaoism has been traditionally associated with Northern China, Southern China, and Western China, and originated from Southern China.\nDuring the late 20th century, Taoism began to spread to the Western world, leading to various forms of Taoist communities in the West, with Taoist publications, websites, meditation and Tai chi centers, and translations of Taoist texts by western scholars as well as non-specialists. Taoist classics like the \"Tao Te Ching\" have also become popular in the New Age movement and in \"popular Western Taoism\", a kind of popularized hybrid spirituality. According to Louis Komjathy, this \"popular Western Taoism\" is associated with popular translations and interpretations of the \"Tao Te Ching\" and the work of popular figures like James Legge, Alan Watts, John Blofeld, Gia-fu Feng, and Bruce Lee. This popular spirituality also draws on Chinese martial arts (which are often unrelated to Taoism proper), American Transcendentalism, 1960s counterculture, New Age spirituality, the perennial philosophy, and alternative medicine.\nOn the other hand, traditionally minded Taoists in the West are often either ethnically Chinese or generally assume some level of sinicization, especially the adoption of Chinese language and culture. This is because, for most traditional Taoists, the religion is not seen as separate from Chinese ethnicity and culture. As such, most Western convert Taoist groups are led either by Chinese teachers or by teachers who studied with Chinese teachers. Some prominent Western Taoist associations include: , , British Daoist Association, Daoist Foundation (San Diego, California), American Taoist and Buddhist Association (New York), Ching Chung Taoist Association (San Francisco), Universal Society of the Integral Way (Ni Hua-Ching), and .\nParticularly popular in the West are groups that focus on internal martial arts like tai chi, as well as qigong and meditation. A smaller set of groups also focus around internal alchemy, such as Mantak Chia's Healing Tao. While traditional Taoism initially arrived in the West through Chinese immigrants, more recently, Western run Taoist temples have also appeared, such as the Taoist Sanctuary in San Diego and the Dayuan Circle in San Francisco. Kohn notes that all of these centers \"combine traditional ritual services with \"Tao Te Ching\" and \"Yijing\" philosophy as well as with various health practices, such as breathing, diet, meditation, qigong, and soft martial arts\".\nTeachings.\nTao.\n\"Tao\" (or \"Dao\") can mean \"way\", \"road\", \"channel\", \"path\", \"doctrine\", or \"line\". Livia Kohn describes the Tao as \"the underlying cosmic power which creates the universe, supports culture and the state, saves the good and punishes the wicked. Literally 'the way', Tao refers to the way things develop naturally, the way nature moves along, and living beings growing and declining in accordance with cosmic laws.\" The Tao is ultimately indescribable and transcends all analysis and definition. Thus, the \"Tao Te Ching\" begins with: \"The Tao that can be told is not eternal Tao.\" Likewise, Louis Komjathy writes that Taoists have described the Tao as \"dark\" (\"xuan\"), \"indistinct\" (\"hu\"), \"obscure\" (\"huang\"), and \"silent\" (\"mo\").\nAccording to Komjathy, the Tao has four primary characteristics: \"(1) Source of all existence; (2) Unnamable mystery; (3) All-pervading sacred presence; and (4) Universe as cosmological process.\" As such, Taoist thought can be seen as monistic (the Tao is one reality), panenhenic (seeing nature as sacred), and panentheistic (the Tao is both the sacred world and what is beyond it, immanent and transcendent). Similarly, Wing-tsit Chan describes the Tao as an \"ontological ground\" and as \"the One, which is natural, spontaneous, eternal, nameless, and indescribable. It is at once the beginning of all things and the way in which all things pursue their course.\" The Tao is thus an \"organic order\", which is not a willful or self-conscious creator, but an infinite and boundless natural pattern.\nFurthermore, the Tao is something that individuals can find immanent in themselves and in natural and social patterns. Thus, the Tao is also the \"innate nature\" (\"xing\") of all people, a nature which Taoists see as being ultimately good. In a naturalistic sense, the Tao is a visible pattern, \"the Tao that can be told\", that is, the rhythmic processes and patterns of the natural world that can be observed and described. Thus, Kohn writes that Tao can be explained as twofold: the transcendent, ineffable, mysterious Tao and the natural, visible, and tangible Tao.\nDao is a process of reality itself, a way for things to gather together while still changing. All of these reflect the deep-rooted belief of the Chinese people that change is the most fundamental characteristic of things. In the \"Book of Changes\", this pattern of change is symbolized by numbers representing 64 related force relationships, known as hexagrams. Dao is the change of these forces, usually referred to as yin and yang.\nThroughout Taoist history, Taoists have developed different metaphysical views regarding the Tao. For example, while the Xuanxue thinker Wang Bi described Tao as w\u00fa (nothingness, negativity, not-being), Guo Xiang rejected w\u00fa as the source and held that instead the true source was spontaneous \"self-production\" (z\u00ecsh\u0113ng \u81ea\u751f) and \"self-transformation\" (z\u00echu\u00e0 \u81ea\u5316). Another school, the Ch\u00f3ngxu\u00e1n (Twofold Mystery), developed a metaphysics influenced by Buddhist Madhyamaka philosophy.\nDe.\nThe active expression of Tao is called \"De\" (; also spelled \"Te\" or \"Teh\"; often translated with virtue or power), in a sense that \"De\" results from an individual living and cultivating the Tao. The term \"De\" can be used to refer to ethical virtue in the conventional Confucian sense, as well as to a higher spontaneous kind of sagely virtue or power that comes from following the Tao and practicing \"wu-wei\". Thus, it is a natural expression of the Tao's power and not anything like conventional morality. Louis Komjathy describes \"De\" as the manifestation of one's connection to the Tao, which is a beneficial influence of one's cosmological attunement.\nZiran.\n\"Ziran\" (; lit. \"self-so\", \"self-organization\") is regarded as a central concept and value in Taoism and as a way of flowing with the Tao. It describes the \"primordial state\" of all things as well as a basic character of the Tao, and is usually associated with spontaneity and creativity. According to Kohn, in the \"Zhuangzi\", \"ziran\" refers to the fact that \"there is thus no ultimate cause to make things what they are. The universe exists by itself and of itself; it is existence just as it is. Nothing can be added or subtracted from it; it is entirely sufficient upon itself.\"\nTo attain naturalness, one has to identify with the Tao and flow with its natural rhythms as expressed in oneself. This involves freeing oneself from selfishness and desire and appreciating simplicity. It also consists of understanding one's nature and living in accordance with it without trying to be something one is not or overthinking one's experience. One way of cultivating \"ziran\" found in the \"Zhuangzi\" is to practice the \"fasting of the mind\", a kind of Taoist meditation in which one empties the mind. It is held that this can also activate qi (vital energy). In some passages found in the \"Zhuangzi\" and in the \"Tao Te Ching\", naturalness is also associated with rejection of the state (anarchism) and a desire to return to simpler pre-technological times (primitivism).\nAn often cited metaphor for naturalness is \"pu\" (), the \"uncarved log\", which represents the \"original nature\u00a0... prior to the imprint of culture\" of an individual. It is usually referred to as a state one may return to.\n\"Wu wei\".\nThe term \"wu-wei\" constitutes the leading ethical concept in Taoism. \"Wei\" refers to any intentional or deliberated action, while \"wu\" carries the meaning of \"there is no ...\" or \"lacking, without\". Standard translations are non-action, effortless action, action without intent, non-interference, and non-intervention. The meaning is sometimes emphasized by using the paradoxical expression \"wei wu wei\": an action without action. Kohn writes that \"wuwei\" refers to \"letting go of egoistic concerns\" and \"to abstain from forceful and interfering measures that cause tensions and disruption in favor of gentleness, adaptation, and ease.\"\nIn ancient Taoist texts, wu-wei is associated with water through its yielding nature and the effortless way it flows around obstacles. Taoist philosophy, in accordance with the \"I Ching\", proposes that the universe works harmoniously according to its own ways. When someone exerts their will against the world in a manner that is out of rhythm with the cycles of change, they may disrupt that harmony, and unintended consequences may more likely result rather than the willed outcome. Thus, the \"Tao Te Ching\" says: \"act of things and you will ruin them. Grasp for things and you will lose them. Therefore, the sage acts with inaction and has no ruin, lets go of grasping and has no loss.\"\nTaoism does not identify one's will as the root problem. Instead, it asserts that one must place one's will in harmony with the natural way of the universe. Thus, a potentially harmful interference may be avoided, and in this way, goals can be achieved effortlessly. \"By wu-wei, the sage seeks to come into harmony with the great Tao, which itself accomplishes by nonaction.\"\nAspects of self (xing, xin, and ming).\nThe Taoist view of the self is holistic and rejects the idea of a separate individualized self. As Russell Kirkland writes, Taoists \"generally assume that one's 'self' cannot be understood or fulfilled without reference to other persons, and to the broader set of realities in which all persons are naturally and properly embedded.\"\nIn Taoism, one's innate or fundamental nature (xing) is ultimately the Tao expressing or manifesting itself as an embodied person. Innate nature is connected with one's heart-mind (xin), which refers to consciousness, the heart, and one's spirit. The focus of Taoist psychology is the heart-mind (xin), the intellectual and emotional center (zhong) of a person. It is associated with the chest cavity and the physical heart, as well as with emotions, thoughts, consciousness, and the storehouse of spirit (shen). When the heart-mind is unstable and separated from the Tao, it is called the ordinary heart-mind (suxin). On the other hand, the original heart-mind (benxin) pervades Tao and is constant and peaceful.\nThe \"Neiye\" (ch.14) calls this pure original heart-mind the \"inner heart-mind\", \"an awareness that precedes language\", and \"a lodging place of the numinous\". Later Taoist sources also refer to it by other terms like \"awakened nature\" (wuxing), \"original nature\" (benxing), \"original spirit\" (yuanshen), and \"scarlet palace\". This pure heart-mind is seen as being characterized by clarity and stillness (qingjing), purity, pure yang, spiritual insight, and emptiness.\nTaoists see life (sheng) as an expression of the Tao. The Tao is seen as granting each person a \"ming\" (life destiny), which is one's corporeal existence, one's body and vitality. Generally speaking, Taoist cultivation seeks a holistic psychosomatic form of training that is described as \"dual cultivation of innate nature and life-destiny\" (\"xingming shuanxiu\"). Taoism believes in a \"pervasive spirit world that is both interlocked with and separate from the world of humans.\"\nThe cultivation of innate nature is often associated with the practice of stillness (jinggong) or quiet meditation, while the cultivation of life-destiny generally revolves around movement-based practices (dongong) like daoyin and health and longevity practices (yangsheng).\nThe Taoist body.\nMany Taoist practices work with ancient Chinese understandings of the body, its organs and parts, \"elixir fields\" (dantien), inner substances (such as \"essence\" or jing), animating forces (like the hun and po), and meridians (qi channels). The complex Taoist schema of the body and its subtle body components contains many parallels with Traditional Chinese medicine and is used for health practices as well as for somatic and spiritual transformation (through neidan \u2013 \"psychosomatic transmutation\" or \"internal alchemy\"). Taoist physical cultivation rely on purifying and transforming the body's qi (vital breath, energy) in various ways such as dieting and meditation.\nAccording to Livia Kohn, qi is \"the cosmic energy that pervades all. The concrete aspect of Tao, qi, is the material force of the universe, the basic stuff of nature.\" According to the \"Zhuangzi,\" \"human life is the accumulation of qi; death is its dispersal.\" Everyone has some amount of qi and can gain and lose qi in various ways. Therefore, Taoists hold that through various qi cultivation methods they can harmonize their qi, and thus improve health and longevity, and even attain magic powers, social harmony, and immortality. The \"Neiye\" (Inward Training) is one of the earliest texts that teach qi cultivation methods.\nQi is one of the Three Treasures, which is a specifically Taoist schema of the main elements in Taoist physical practices like qigong and neidan. The three are: jing (\u7cbe, essence, the foundation for one's vitality), qi and sh\u00e9n (\u795e, spirit, subtle consciousness, a capacity to connect with the subtle spiritual reality).\"\" These three are further associated with the three \"elixir fields\" (dantien) and the organs in different ways.\"\"\nThe body in Taoist political philosophy was important and their differing views on it and humanity's place in the universe were a point of distinction from Confucian politicians, writers, and political commentators. Some Taoists viewed ancestors as merely corpses that were improperly revered and respect for the dead as irrelevant and others within groups that followed these beliefs viewed almost all traditions as worthless.\nEthics.\nDaoist ethics tends to emphasize various themes from the Taoist classics, such as naturalness (\"pu\"), spontaneity (\"ziran\"), simplicity, detachment from desires, and most important of all, \"wu-wei\". The classic Daoist view is that humans are originally and naturally aligned with Tao; thus, their original nature is inherently good. It emphasizes doing things that are natural, following the Tao, which is a cosmic force that flows through all things and binds and releases them. However, one can fall away from this due to personal habits, desires, and social conditions. Returning to one's nature requires active attunement through Daoist practice and ethical cultivation.\nSome popular Daoist beliefs, such as the early Shangqing school, do not believe this and believe that some people are irredeemably evil and destined to be so. Many Taoist movements from around the time Buddhist elements started being syncretized with Daoism had a highly negative view of foreigners, referring to them as \"yi\" or \"barbarians\", and some of these thought of foreigners as people who do not feel \"human feelings\" and who never live out the correct norms of conduct until they became Taoist. At this time, China was widely viewed by Taoists as a holy land because of influence from the Chinese public that viewed being born in China as a privilege and that outsiders were enemies. Preserving a sense of \"Chineseness\" in the country and rewarding nativist policies such as the building of the Great Wall of China was important to many Taoist groups.\nForeigners who joined these Taoist sects were made to repent for their sins in another life that caused them to be born \"in the frontier wilds\" because of Buddhist ideas of reincarnation coming into their doctrines. Some Daoist movements viewed human nature neutrally. However, some of the movements that were dour or skeptical about human nature did not believe that evil is permanent and believed that evil people can become good. Korean Daoists tended to think extremely positively of human nature.\nSome of the most important virtues in Taoism are the \"Three Treasures\" or \"Three Jewels\" (). These are: \"ci\" (, usually translated as \"compassion\"), \"jian\" (, usually translated as \"moderation\"), and \"bugan wei tianxia xian\" (, but usually translated as \"humility\"). Arthur Waley, applying them to the socio-political sphere, translated them as: \"abstention from aggressive war and capital punishment\", \"absolute simplicity of living\", and \"refusal to assert active authority\".\nTaoism also adopted the Buddhist doctrines of karma and reincarnation into its religious ethical system. Medieval Taoist thought developed the idea that ethics was overseen by a celestial administration that kept records of people's actions and their fate, as well as handed out rewards and punishments through particular celestial administrators.\nIn its original form, the religion does not involve political affairs or complex rituals; on the contrary, it encourages the avoidance of public responsibility and the search for a vision of a spiritual, transcendent world.\nSoteriology and religious goals.\nTaoists have different religious goals that include Taoist conceptions of sagehood (\"zhenren\"), spiritual self-cultivation, a happy afterlife or longevity and some form of immortality (\"xian\", variously understood as a kind of transcendent post-mortem state of the spirit).\nTaoists' views about what happens in the afterlife tend to include the soul becoming a part of the cosmos (which was often thought of as an illusionary place where \"qi\" and physical matter were thought of as being the same in a way held together by the microcosm of the spirits of the human body and the macrocosm of the universe itself, represented and embodied by the Three Pure Ones), somehow aiding the spiritual functions of nature or \"Tian\" after death or being saved by either achieving spiritual immortality in an afterlife or becoming a \"xian\" who can appear in the human world at will, but normally lives in another plane. \"[S]acred forests and[/or] mountains\" or a yin-yang, yin, yang, or Tao realm inconceivable and incomprehensible by normal humans and even the virtuous Confucius and Confucianists, such as the mental realm sometimes called \"the Heavens\" where higher, spiritual versions of Daoists such as Laozi were thought to exist when they were alive and absorb \"the purest Yin and Yang\" were all possibilities for a potential \"xian\" to be reborn in. These spiritual versions were thought to be abstract beings that can manifest in that world as mythical beings such as \"xian\" dragons who eat yin and yang energy and ride clouds and their \"qi\".\nMore specifically, possibilities for \"the spirit of the body\" include \"join[ing] the universe after death\", exploring or serving various functions in parts of \"ti\u0101n\" or other spiritual worlds, or becoming a \"xian\" who can do one or more of those things.\nTaoist \"xian\" are often seen as being eternally young because \"of their life being totally at one with the Tao of nature.\" They are also often seen as being made up of \"pure breath and light\" and as being able to shapeshift, and some Taoists believed their afterlife natural \"paradises\" were palaces of heaven.\nTaoists who sought to become one of the many different types of immortals, such as \"xian\" or \"zhenren\", wanted to \"ensure complete physical and spiritual immortality\".\nIn the Quanzhen school of Wang Chongyang, the goal is to become a sage, which he equates with being a \"spiritual immortal\" (\"shen xien\") and with the attainment of \"clarity and stillness\" (\"qingjing\") through the integration of \"inner nature\" (xing) and \"worldly reality\" (ming).\nThose who know the Tao, who flow with the natural way of the Tao and thus embody the patterns of the Tao, are called sages or \"perfected persons\" (zhenren). This is what is often considered salvation in Taoist soteriology. They often are depicted as living simple lives, as craftsmen or hermits. In other cases, they are depicted as the ideal rulers who practice ruling through non-intervention and under whom nations prosper peacefully. Sages are the highest humans, mediators between heaven and earth, and the best guides on the Taoist path. They act naturally and simply, with a pure mind and with wuwei. They may have supernatural powers and bring good fortune and peace.\nSome sages are also considered to have become one of the immortals (xian) through their mastery of the Tao. After shedding their mortal form, spiritual immortals may have many superhuman abilities like flight and are often said to live in heavenly realms.\nThe sages are thus because they have attained the primary goal of Taoism: a union with the Tao and harmonization or alignment with its patterns and flows. This experience is one of being attuned to the Tao and to our own original nature, which already has a natural capacity for resonance (ganying) with Tao. This is the main goal that all Daoist practices are aiming towards and can be felt in various ways, such as a sense of psychosomatic vitality and aliveness, as well as stillness and a \"true joy\" (zhenle) or \"celestial joy\" that remains unaffected by mundane concerns like gain and loss.\nThe Taoist quest for immortality was inspired by Confucian emphasis on filial piety and how worshipped ancestors were thought to exist after death.\nBecoming an immortal through the power of yin-yang and heaven, but also specifically Taoist interpretations of the Tao, was sometimes thought of as possible in Chinese folk religion, and Taoist thoughts on immortality were sometimes drawn from Confucian views on heaven and its status as an afterlife that permeates the mortal world as well.\nCosmology.\nTaoist cosmology is cyclic\u2014the universe is seen as being in constant change, with various forces and energies (qi) affecting each other in different complex patterns. Taoist cosmology shares similar views with the School of Naturalists. Taoist cosmology focuses on the impersonal transformations (zaohua) of the universe, which are spontaneous and unguided.\nLivia Kohn explains the basic Taoist cosmological theory as:\n The root of creation Tao rested in deep chaos (ch. 42). Next, it evolved into the One, a concentrated state of cosmic unity that is full of creative potential and often described in \"I Ching\" terms as the taiji. The One then brought forth \"the Two\", the two energies yin and yang, which in turn merged in harmony to create the next level of existence, \"the Three\" (yin-yang combined), from which the myriad beings came forth. From original oneness, the world thus continued to move into ever greater states of distinction and differentiation.\nThe main distinction in Taoist cosmology is that between \"yin and yang\", which applies to various sets of complementary ideas: bright \u2013 dark, light \u2013 heavy, soft \u2013 hard, strong \u2013 weak, above \u2013 below, ruler \u2013 minister, male \u2013 female, and so on. Cosmically, these two forces exist in mutual harmony and interdependence. Yin and yang are further divided into five phases (Wu Xing, or five materials): minor yang, major yang, yin/yang, minor yin, major yin. Each correlates with a specific substance: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water, respectively. This schema is used in many different ways in Taoist thought and practice, from nourishing life (yangsheng) and medicine to astrology and divination.\nTaoists also generally see all things as being animated and constituted by \"qi\" (vital air, subtle breath), which is seen as a force that circulates throughout the universe and throughout human bodies (as both air in the lungs and as a subtle breath throughout the body's meridians and organs). Qi is in constant transformation between its condensed state (life) and diluted state (potential). These two different states of qi are embodiments of yin and yang, two complementary forces that constantly play against and with each other and where one cannot exist without the other.\nTaoist texts present various creation stories and cosmogonies. Classic cosmogonies are nontheistic, presenting a natural undirected process in which an apophatic undifferentiated potentiality (called wuwuji, \"without non-differentiation\") naturally unfolds into wuji (primordial oneness, \"non-differentiation\"), which then evolves into yin-yang (taiji) and then into the myriad beings, as in the \"Tao Te Ching\". Later medieval models included the idea of a creator God (mainly seen as Lord Lao), representing order and creativity. Taoist cosmology influences Taoist soteriology, which holds that one can \"return to the root\" (guigen) of the universe (and of ourselves), which is also the Tao\u2014the impersonal source (yuan) of all things.\nIn Taoism, human beings are seen as a microcosm of the universe, and thus the cosmological forces, like the five phases, are also present in the form of the zang-fu organs. Another common belief is that there are various gods that reside in human bodies. As a consequence, it is believed that a deeper understanding of the universe can be achieved by understanding oneself.\nAnother important element of Taoist cosmology is the use of Chinese astrology.\nTheology.\nTaoist theology can be defined as apophatic, given its philosophical emphasis on the formlessness and unknowable nature of the Tao and the primacy of the \"Way\" rather than anthropomorphic concepts of God. Nearly all the sects share this core belief.\nArguments for a monotheistic Taoism exist. Nevertheless, Taoism features a pantheon of deities and spirits associated with both living and non-living things, making it animistic and polytheistic in a secondary sense, as they are seen as emanations from an impersonal ultimate principle. Some Taoist theologies present the Three Pure Ones at the top of the pantheon of deities, depicting a hierarchy emanating from the Tao. Laozi is considered the incarnation of one of the Three and worshiped as the ancestral founder of Taoism.\nThe gods and immortals ) worshiped in Taoism can be roughly divided into two categories: namely, \"gods\" and \"xian\" (immortals). \"Gods\" are also deities, and there are many kinds, including a god of Heaven (); a god of ground (); \"wuling\" (), the spirit of all things; a god of the netherworld (); a god of the human body (); and a god of human souls (). Among these gods, the gods of Heaven, the ground, the netherworld, and the human body are innate beings. \"Xian\" (immortality) is acquired via cultivation of the Tao, and also bestows supernatural powers.\nThe branches of Taoism have differing pantheons of lesser deities, wherein these deities reflect distinct cosmologies. Lesser deities may be promoted or demoted for their activity. Some varieties of popular Chinese religion incorporate the Jade Emperor (Y\u00fc-Huang or Y\u00fc-Di), one of the Three Pure Ones, as the highest God. Historical Taoist figures\u2014and individuals considered to have become immortal (\"xian\")\u2014are also venerated.\nDespite these hierarchies of deities, most conceptions of Tao should not be analogized with the Western sense of theism. \"Being one with the Tao\" does not necessarily indicate a union with a supreme deity, principle, or reality, as is believed achievable in, for example, forms of theistic Hinduism.\nPractices.\nSome key elements of Taoist practice include a commitment to self-cultivation, \"wu wei\", and attunement to the patterns of the Tao.The practice of Taoism seeks to develop the body back to its original level of energy and restore it to its original state of creation. The body is no longer just a means of living in harmony in the world; it is itself a universe. Most Taoists throughout history have agreed on the importance of self cultivation through various practices, which were seen as ways to transform oneself and integrate oneself to the deepest realities.\nCommunal rituals are important in most Taoist traditions, as are methods of self-cultivation. Taoist self-cultivation practices tend to focus on the transformation of the heartmind together with bodily substances and energies (like \"jing\" and \"qi\") and their connection to natural and universal forces, patterns, and powers.\nDespite the detachment from reality and dissent from Confucian humanism that the \"Tao Te Ching\" teaches, Taoists were and are generally not misanthropes or nihilists and see humans as an important class of things in the world. However, in most Taoist views humans were not held to be especially important in comparison to other aspects of the world and Taoist metaphysics that were seen as equally or more special. Similarly, some Taoists had similar views on their gods or the gods of other religions.\nAccording to Louis Komjathy, Taoist practice is a complex subject that includes \"aesthetics, art, dietetics, ethics, health and longevity practice, meditation, ritual, seasonal attunement, scripture study, and so forth.\"\nThroughout the history of Taoism, mountains have occupied a special place for Taoist practice. They are seen as sacred spaces and as the ideal places for Taoist cultivation and Taoist monastic or eremitic life, which may include \"cloud wandering\" () in the mountains and dwelling in mountain hermitages (an) or grottoes ().\nTao can serve as a life energy instead of qi in some Taoist belief systems.\nThe nine practices.\nOne of the earliest schemas for Taoist practice was the \"nine practices\" or \"nine virtues\" ( ), which were taught in the Celestial Masters school. These were drawn from classic Taoist sources, mainly the \"Tao Te Ching\", and are presented in the \"Laojun jinglu\" (\"Scriptural Statutes of Lord Lao\"; DZ 786).\nThe nine practices are:\nRituals.\nAncient Chinese religion made much use of sacrifices to gods and ancestors, which could include slaughtered animals (such as pigs and ducks) or fruit. The Taoist Celestial Master Zhang Daoling rejected food and animal sacrifices to the gods. Today, many Taoist temples reject animal sacrifice. Sacrifices to the deities remain a key element of Taoist rituals, however. There are various kinds of Taoist rituals, including presenting offerings, scripture reading, sacrifices, incantations, purification rites, confession, petitions, and announcements to the gods, observing the ethical precepts, memorials, chanting, lectures, and communal feasts.\nOn particular holidays, such as the Qingming Festival, street parades take place. These are lively affairs that involve firecrackers, the burning of hell money, and flower-covered floats broadcasting traditional music. They also variously include lion dances and dragon dances, human-occupied puppets (often of the \"Seventh Lord\" and \"Eighth Lord\"), gongfu, and palanquins carrying images of deities. The various participants are not considered performers but possessed by the gods and spirits in question.\nTaoism has two main types of rituals: vernacular and classical. Vernacular rituals are more about the community and include things like healing, protection, and celebrations for farming. Local people often do these and mix Taoist beliefs with local traditions, like ancestor worship and seasonal festivals. On the other hand, classical rituals are more formal and are performed by trained priests in temples. They follow ancient texts and involve detailed ceremonies, offerings, and chants to connect with the Tao and the universe. Examples of classical rituals include the \"Three Purities\" ceremony, which honors important deities, and rituals for purification and meditation. Together, these rituals show different ways people practice Taoism, focusing on community and personal spirituality.\nEthical precepts.\nTaking up and living by sets of ethical precepts is another important practice in Taoism. By the Tang dynasty, Taoism had created a system of lay discipleship in which one took a set of Ten precepts (Taoism).\nThe Five precepts (Taoism) are identical to the Buddhist five precepts (which are to avoid: killing [both human and non-human animals], theft, sexual misconduct, lying, and intoxicants like alcohol). The other five were a set of five injunctions: (6) I will maintain harmony with my ancestors and family and never disregard my kin; (7) When I see someone do good, I will support him with joy and delight; (8) When I see someone unfortunate, I will support him with dignity to recover good fortune; (9) When someone comes to do me harm, I will not harbor thoughts of revenge; (10) As long as all beings have not attained the Dao, I will not expect to do so myself.Apart from these common ethical precepts, Taoist traditions also have larger sets of precepts that are often reserved for ordained priests or monastics.\nDivination and magic.\nA key part of many Taoist traditions is the practice of divination. There are many methods used by Chinese Taoists, including I Ching divination, Chinese astrological divination, feng shui (geomantic divination), and the interpretation of various omens.\nMediumship and exorcism are key elements of some Taoist traditions. These can include \"tongji\" mediumship and the practice of planchette writing or spirit writing.\nLongevity practices.\nTaoist longevity methods are closely related to ancient Chinese medicine. Many of these methods date back to Tang dynasty figures like alchemist Sun Simiao (582\u2013683) and the Highest Clarity Patriarch Sima Chengzhen (647\u2013735). The goal of these methods ranges from better health and longevity to immortality. Key elements of these \"nourishing life\" (yangsheng) methods include: moderation in all things (drink, food, etc.), adapting to the cycles of the seasons by following injunctions regarding healing exercises (daoyin), and breathwork.\nA number of physical practices, like modern forms of qigong, as well as modern internal martial arts (neijia) like Taijiquan, Baguazhang, Xingyiquan, and Liuhebafa, are practiced by Taoists as methods of cultivating health and longevity as well as eliciting internal alchemical transformations. However, these methods are not specifically Taoist and are often practiced outside of Taoist contexts.\nAnother key longevity method is \"ingestion\", which focuses on what one absorbs or consumes from one's environment and is seen as affecting what one becomes. Diatectics, closely influenced by Chinese medicine, is a key element of ingestion practice, and there are numerous Taoist diet regimens for different effects (such as ascetic diets, monastic diets, therapeutic diets, and alchemical diets that use herbs and minerals). One common practice is the avoidance of grains (bigu). In certain cases, practices like vegetarianism and true fasting are also adopted (which may also be termed \"bigu\").\nSome Taoists thought of the human body as a spiritual nexus with thousands of \"shen\" (often 36,000), gods who were likely thought of as at least somewhat mental in nature because of the word's other meaning of consciousness, that could be communed with by doing various methods to manipulate the yin and yang of the body, as well as its qi. These Taoists also thought of the human body as a metaphorical existence where three \"cinnabar fields\" that represented a higher level of reality or a spiritual kind of cinnabar that does not exist in normal reality. A method of meditation used by these Taoists was \"visualizing light\" that was thought to be \"qi\" or another kind of life energy, a Taoist substitute for \"qi\", or believed in the existence of instead. The light was then channeled through the three cinnabar fields, forming a \"microcosmic orbit\" or through the hands and feet for a \"macrocosmic orbit\".\nThe 36,000 \"shen\" regulated the body and bodily functions through a bureaucratic system \"modeled after the Chinese system of government\". Death occurs only when these gods leave, but life can be extended by meditating while visualizing them, doing good deeds, and avoiding meat and wine.\nMeditation.\nThere are many methods of Taoist meditation (often referred to as \"stillness practice\", \"jinggong\"), some of which were strongly influenced by Buddhist methods.\nSome of the key forms of Taoist meditation are:\nAlchemy.\nA key element of many schools of Taoism are alchemical practices, which include rituals, meditations, exercises, and the creation of various alchemical substances. The goals of alchemy include physical and spiritual transformation, aligning oneself spiritually with cosmic forces, undertaking ecstatic spiritual journeys, improving physical health, extending one's life, and even becoming an immortal (xian).\nTaoist alchemy can be found in early Taoist scriptures like the \"Taiping Jing\" and the \"Baopuzi\". There are two main kinds of alchemy, internal alchemy (neidan) and external alchemy (waidan). Internal alchemy (neidan, literally: \"internal elixir\"), which focuses on the transformation and increase of qi in the body, developed during the late imperial period (especially during the Tang) and is found in almost all Taoist schools today, though it is most closely associated with the Quanzhen School. There are many systems of internal alchemy with different methods such as visualization and breathwork. In the late Imperial period, Neidan developed into complex systems that drew on numerous elements, including: classic Taoist texts and meditations, yangsheng, I Ching symbology, Taoist cosmology, external alchemy concepts and terms, Chinese medicine, and Buddhist influences. Neidan systems tend to be passed on through oral master-disciple lineages that are often to be secret.\nLivia Kohn writes that the main goal of internal alchemy is generally understood as a set of three transformations: \"from essence (jing) to energy (qi), from energy to spirit (shen), and from spirit to Dao.\" Common methods for this include engaging the subtle body and activating the microcosmic orbit. Louis Komjathy adds that neidan seeks to create a transcendent spirit, usually called the \"immortal embryo\" (xiantai) or \"yang spirit\" (yangshen).\nTexts.\nSome religious Taoist movements view traditional texts as scriptures that are considered sacred, authoritative, binding, and divinely inspired or revealed. However, the \"Tao Te Ching\" was originally viewed as \"human wisdom\" and \"written by humans for humans.\" It and other important texts \"acquired authority...that caused them to be regarded...as sacred.\"\nPerhaps the most influential texts are the \"Tao Te Ching\" and the \"Zhuangzi\".\n\"Tao Te Ching\".\nThroughout the history of Taoism, the \"Tao Te Ching\" has been a central text, used for ritual, self-cultivation, and philosophical purposes.\nAccording to legend, the \"Tao Te Ching\" (also known as the \"Laozi\") was written by Laozi. Authorship, precise date of origin, and even unity of the text are still subject of debate and will probably never be known with certainty. The earliest manuscripts of this work (written on bamboo tablets) date back to the late 4th century BCE, and these contain significant differences from the later received edition (of Wang Bi c.\u2009226\u2013249). Apart from the Guodian text and the Wang Bi edition, another alternative version exists, the Mawangdui Tao Te Chings.\nLouis Komjathy writes that the \"Tao Te Ching\" is \"actually a multi-vocal anthology consisting of a variety of historical and textual layers; in certain respects, it is a collection of oral teachings of various members of the inner cultivation lineages.\" Meanwhile, Russell Kirkland argues that the text arose out of \"various traditions of oral wisdom\" from the state of Chu that were written, circulated, edited, and rewritten by different hands. He also suggests that authors from the Jixia academy may have been involved in the editing process.\nThe \"Tao Te Ching \"is not organized in any clear fashion and is a collection of different sayings on various themes. The leading themes of the Tao Te Ching revolve around the nature of Tao, how to attain it and De, the inner power of Tao, as well as the idea of wei wu-wei. Tao is said to be ineffable and accomplishes great things through small, lowly, effortless, and \"feminine\" (yin) ways (which are compared to the behavior of water).\nAncient commentaries on the \"Tao Te Ching\" are important texts in their own right. Perhaps the oldest one, the \"Heshang Gong\" commentary, was most likely written in the 2nd century CE. Other important commentaries include the one from Wang Bi and the Xiang'er commentary.\n\"Zhuangzi\".\nThe \"Zhuangzi\" (\"Book of Master Zhuang\", ), named after its supposed author Zhuang Zhou, is a highly influential composite text of multi-vocal writings from various sources and historical periods. The commentator and editor Guo Xiang (c. CE 300) helped establish the text as an important source for Taoist thought. One traditional view is that a sage called Zhuang Zhou wrote the first seven chapters (the \"inner chapters\"), and his students and related thinkers were responsible for the other parts (the outer and miscellaneous chapters). However, some modern scholars, like Russell Kirkland, argue that Guo Xiang is actually the creator of the 33-chapter Zhuangzi text and that there is no solid historical data for the existence of Zhuang Zhou himself (other than the sparse and unreliable mentions in Sima Qian). Zhuangzi also introduced seven versions of the meeting between Laozi and Confucius. Laozi is portrayed as growing old, and his Taoist teachings confuse his famous interlocutors. Zhuangzi also provides the only record of Laozi's death.\nThe \"Zhuangzi\" uses anecdotes, parables, and dialogues to express one of its main themes\u2014avoiding cultural constructs and instead living in a spontaneous way aligned with the natural world. This way of living might be perceived as \"useless\" by most people who follow their own \"common sense\" and social and political rules, but this uselessness is actually a wiser alternative, since it is more in accord with reality.\nChinese classics.\nTaoism draws on numerous Chinese classics that are not themselves \"Taoist\" texts but that remain important sources for Taoists. Perhaps the most important of these is the ancient divination text called the \"Yijing\" (circa 1150 BCE). The divination method in the \"Yijing\" and its associated concepts of yin and yang mapped into 64 \"hexagrams\"\u2014combinations of the 8 trigrams\u2014has influenced Taoism from its inception until today.\nTaoism also drew on other non-Taoist Chinese classic texts including:\nOther important Taoist texts.\nThere are many other important Taoist texts, including:\n\"The Taoist Canon\".\nThe Taoist Canon (, \"Treasury of Tao\") is also referred to as the \"Daozang\". It was originally compiled during the Jin, Tang, and Song dynasties. The extant version was published during the Ming dynasty. The Ming \"Daozang\" includes almost 1,500 texts. Following the example of the Buddhist Tripi\u1e6daka, it is divided into three \"dong\" (, \"caves\" or \"grottoes\"). They are arranged from \"highest\" to \"lowest\":\n\"Taoist\" generally do not consult published versions of the Daozang, but individually choose or inherit texts included in the Daozang. These texts have been passed down for generations from teacher to student.\nThe Shangqing School has a tradition of approaching Taoism through scriptural study. It is believed that by reciting certain texts often enough one will be rewarded with immortality.\nSymbols and images.\nThe \"taijitu\", commonly known as the \"yin and yang symbol\" or simply the \"yin-yang\", and the \"bagua\" are important symbols in Taoism because they represent key elements of Taoist cosmology (see above). Many Taoist (as well as non-Taoist) organizations make use of these symbols, and they may appear on flags and logos, temple floors, or stitched into clerical robes. What has become the standardised yin-yang taijitu originated as a Taoist symbol in the 10th century CE during the early Song dynasty.\nThe tiger and dragon are more ancient symbols for yin and yang respectively, and these two animals are still widely used in Taoist art. Taoist temples in southern China and Taiwan may often be identified by their roofs, which feature dragons, tigers, and phoenixes (with the phoenix also standing for yin) made from multicolored ceramic tiles. In general though, Chinese Taoist architecture lacks universal features that distinguish it from other structures.\nTaoist temples may fly square or triangular flags. They typically feature mystical writing, talismans, or diagrams and are intended to fulfill various functions including providing guidance for the spirits of the dead, bringing good fortune, increasing life span, etc. Other flags and banners may be those of the gods or immortals themselves.\nDrawings of the Big Dipper (also called the Bushel) are also important symbols. In the Shang dynasty of the 2nd millennium BCE, Chinese thought regarded the Big Dipper as a deity, while, in later periods, it came to symbolize Taiji. A related symbol is the flaming pearl, which stands for the pole star and may be seen on such roofs between two dragons as well as on the hairpin of a Celestial Master.\nSome Taoists saw the stars as \"knots in the 'net of Heaven'\" that connected everything in \"heaven and earth\".\nMany Taoists saw the Tao as \"the [metaphorical] pearl of the sage\" and a \"conjunction between yin...[and] yang.\" Taoists also revered pearls more generally, seeing \"lung\" dragon celestials as emerging from the glint of light off of a pearl that existed \"in the mists of chaos\" and trapped in an endless cycle where they continually retrieve the pearl that makes them out of the mists. Some Internal Alchemy Taoists worshipped mercury as \"divine water\" and an embodiment of consciousness that was a \"flowing pearl\".\nIn the later Qing dynasty, Taoists and intellectuals who leaned towards Taoism used the \"wuxing\" as symbols of leadership and good governance, using old religious texts and various historiographies made in prior dynasties to assign a phase from the five \"wuxing\" to different Chinese dynasties.\nSymbols that represent longevity and immortality are particularly popular, and these include: cranes, pine trees, and the peaches of immortality (associated with the Queen Mother of the West). Natural symbols are also common, and include gourds, caves, clouds, mountains, and the animals of the Chinese zodiac. Other symbols used by Taoists include: the Yellow River Map, the Luoshu Square, I Ching coins, Taoist talismans (fulu), the Four Symbols (mythical creatures), and various Chinese characters (such as the character for Tao and the \"shou\" ('longevity') character).\nTaoist priests also wear distinctive robes, such as the Daojiao fushi and Taoist versions of the Daopao, which symbolize their status and school affiliation.\nSociety.\nTaoist communities can include a wide variety of people and groups, including daoshi, hermits, monastics, teachers, householders, ascetics, family lineages, teacher-disciple lineages, urban associations, temples, and monasteries.\nAccording to Russell Kirkland, throughout most of its history, most Taoist traditions \"were founded and maintained by aristocrats or by members of the later well-to-do 'gentry' class\". The only real exception is the Celestial Masters movement, which had a strong basis in the lower classes (though even this movement had a hereditary leadership made up of figures of the Chang clan for generations).\nAdherents.\nThe number of Taoists is difficult to estimate, due to a variety of factors, including defining Taoism. According to a survey of religion in China in 2010, the number of people practicing some form of Chinese folk religion is near to 950 million, which is 70% of Chinese. Among these, 173 million (13%) claim an affiliation with Taoist practices. 12 million people stated that they were \"Taoists\", a term traditionally used exclusively for initiates, priests, and experts of Taoist rituals and methods.\nSince the creation of the People's Republic of China, the government has encouraged a revival of Taoist traditions in codified settings. In 1956, the Chinese Taoist Association was formed to administer the activities of all registered Taoist orders, and received official approval in 1957.\nIt was disbanded during the Cultural Revolution under Mao Zedong, but was reestablished in 1980. The headquarters of the association are at the \"Baiyunguan\", or White Cloud Temple of Beijing, belonging to the Longmen branch of the Quanzhen tradition. Since 1980, many Taoist monasteries and temples have been reopened or rebuilt, both belonging to the Zhengyi or Quanzhen schools, and clergy ordination has been resumed.\nTaoist literature and art has influenced the cultures of Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. Organized Taoism seems not to have attracted a large non-Chinese following until modern times. In Taiwan, 7.5 million people, 33% of the population, identify themselves as Taoists. Data collected in 2010 for religious demographics of Hong Kong and Singapore show that, respectively, 14% and 11% of the people of these cities identify as Taoists.\nFollowers of Daoism are present in Chinese \u00e9migr\u00e9 communities outside Asia. It has attracted followers with no Chinese heritage. For example, in Brazil there are Daoist temples in S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro that are affiliated with the Taoist Society of China. Membership of these temples is entirely of non-Chinese ancestry.\nArt and poetry.\nThroughout Chinese history, there have been many examples of art being influenced by Taoism. Notable painters influenced by Taoism include Wu Wei, Huang Gongwang, Mi Fu, Muqi Fachang, Shitao, Ni Zan, Tang Mi, and Wang Zengzu. Taoist arts and belles-lettres represents the different regions, dialects, and time spans that are commonly associated with Taoism. Ancient Taoist art was commissioned by the aristocracy; however, scholars masters and adepts also directly engaged in the art themselves.\nPolitical aspects.\nTaoism never had a unified political theory. While Huang\u2013Lao positions justified a strong emperor as the legitimate ruler, the Taoist \"primitivists\" (of chapters 8\u201311 of the \"Zhuangzi\") argued for a kind of anarchism. A more moderate position is presented in the Inner Chapters of the \"Zhuangzi\" in which the political life is presented with disdain and some kind of pluralism or perspectivism is preferred.\nThe syncretist position found in texts like the \"Huainanzi\" and some of the Outer Chapters of the \"Zhuangzi\" blend Taoist positions with Confucian views.\nRelations with other traditions.\nMany scholars believe Taoism arose as a countermovement to Confucianism. The philosophical terms \"Tao\" and \"De\" are indeed shared by both Taoism and Confucianism. Zhuangzi explicitly criticized Confucian and Mohist tenets in his work. In general, Taoism rejects the Confucian emphasis on rituals, hierarchical social order, and conventional morality, and favors \"naturalness\", spontaneity, and individualism instead.\nThe entry of Buddhism into China was marked by significant interaction and syncretism with Taoism. Originally seen as a kind of \"foreign Taoism\", Buddhism's scriptures were translated into Chinese using the Taoist vocabulary. Representatives of early Chinese Buddhism, like Sengzhao and Tao Sheng, knew and were deeply influenced by the Taoist keystone texts.\nTaoism especially shaped the development of Chan Buddhism, introducing elements like the concept of \"naturalness\", distrust of scripture and text, and emphasis on embracing \"this life\" and living in the \"every-moment\". Zhuangzi's statements that the Tao was omnipresent and that creation escorts animals and humans to death influenced Chinese Buddhist practitioners and scholars, especially Chan Buddhists. On the other hand, Taoism also incorporated Buddhist elements during the Tang dynasty. Examples of such influence include monasteries, vegetarianism, prohibition of alcohol, the doctrine of emptiness, and collecting scripture in tripartite organization in certain sects.\nIdeological and political rivals for centuries, Taoism, Confucianism, Hinduism, and Buddhism deeply influenced one another. For example, Wang Bi, one of the most influential philosophical commentators on \"Laozi\" (and the \"I Ching\"), was a Confucian. The three rivals also share some similar values, with all three embracing a humanist philosophy emphasizing moral behavior and human perfection. In time, most Chinese people identified to some extent with all three traditions simultaneously. This became institutionalized when aspects of the three schools were synthesized in the Neo-Confucian school.\nChristian and Taoist contact often took place in the Tang dynasty, and some scholars believe that the Church of the East influenced Taoist thought on the Three Pure Ones. Emperor Taizong encouraged this, and Taoists who agreed with him and his laws incorporated elements of Christianity, Islam, Manichaeism, Judaism, Confucianism, and Buddhism into their faith.\nComparisons with other religions.\nComparisons between Taoism and Epicureanism have focused on the absence of a creator or gods controlling the forces of nature in both. Lucretius' poem \"De rerum natura\" describes a naturalist cosmology where there are only atoms and void (a primal duality which mirrors yin-yang in its dance of assertion/yielding), and where nature takes its course with no gods or masters. Other parallels include the similarities between Daoist \"wu wei\" (effortless action) and Epicurean \"lathe biosas\" (live in obscurity), focus on naturalness (\"ziran\") as opposed to conventional virtues, and the prominence of the Epicurus-like Chinese sage Yang Chu in the foundational Taoist writings.\nSome authors have undertaken comparative studies of Taoism and Christianity. This has been of interest for students of the history of religion such as J. J. M. de Groot, among others. A comparison of the teachings of Laozi and Jesus of Nazareth has been made by several authors, such as Martin Aronson, and Toropov &amp; Hansen (2002), who believe that there are parallels that should not be ignored. In the opinion of J. Isamu Yamamoto, the main difference is that Christianity preaches a personal God while Daoism does not. Yet, a number of authors, including Lin Yutang, have argued that some moral and ethical tenets of the religions are similar. In neighboring Vietnam, Taoist values have been shown to adapt to social norms and formed emerging sociocultural beliefs together with Confucianism. It also imitates some Hinduism concept.\nVarieties.\nToday, there are various living Taoist traditions; the largest and most influential are the Quanzhen School, particularly the Dragon Gate sect, and Zhengyi Dao. Quanzhen lineages are mainly monastic and ascetic traditions, based on meditation and internal cultivation, while the Orthodox Unity tradition is based on lay priests (daoshi) who are expected to master an extensive ritual repertoire. These two traditions developed during the Song dynasty and grew to become recognized by the imperial government during late imperial China.\n\"Some sects are concerned with the ritual control of spirits and the cosmic currents of yin and yang; others specialize in inner disciplines of meditation or breath control and mind-body exercise regimes.\"\nThere are also various smaller Taoist groups and traditions of practice. Eva Wong divides the major \"systems\" of Taoism into the following categories: Magical Taoism, Divinational Taoism, Ceremonial Taoism, Internal-Alchemical Taoism, and Action and Karma Taoism.\nMagical Taoism.\nMagical Taoism is one of the oldest systems of Taoism, and its practices are similar to the shamans and sorcerers of ancient China. Magical Taoism believes there are various natural powers, deities, and spirits (benevolent and malevolent) in the universe that can be made use of by specialists who know the right methods. Their magic can include rainmaking, protection, exorcism, healing, traveling to the underworld to help the dead, and mediumship.\nProtection magic can include the use of amulets and fulu, as well as specific rites. Protection rites often include ritual petitions to the celestial deities of the northern bushel. Divination is also a widespread practice. A commonly used method of divination in magical Taoism is sandwriting (planchette writing).\nAccording to Eva Wong, the main sects of magical Taoism today are the Maoshan sect (a very secretive sect, not to be confused with Shangqing), the Celestial Masters and the Kun-Lun sect (which is strongly influenced by Tibetan magic and make use of Taoist and Buddhist deities).\nDivinational Taoism.\nDivinational Taoism focuses on various divination techniques to help one predict the future and live accordingly. This practice can also carry deeper spiritual significance, since it can help one appreciate the flux of the Tao. This form of Taoism owes much to the ancient fang-shih, the Yin and yang school of thought, and often relies on the classic Chinese divination text, the Yijing.\nThis tradition also relies on the cosmology of Wuji and Taiji, along with the teachings of yin and yang, the five elements and the Chinese calendar. There many forms of Daoist divination, they include: celestial divination (which include various systems of Chinese astrology, like Tzu-wei tu-su), terrestrial divination (feng shui), the casting of incense sticks with hexagrams on them and the interpretation of omens.\nContemporary divinational Taoism is practiced in temples and monasteries by various individuals and may not be sect-specific (non-Daoists even practice it). This Taoist practice can be found in the Mao-shan sorcerers, the Celestial Masters sect, and the Dragon Gate Taoism and Wudang Mountains sects. There are also many lay practitioners who are not affiliated with any specific sect. These lay Taoist practitioners are called \"kui-shih\".\nCeremonial Taoism.\nCeremonial Taoism focuses on ritual and devotion towards various celestial deities and spirits. The basic belief of ceremonial Taoism is that through various rites, human beings can honor the deities, and these deities may then grant them power, protection, and blessings. Rituals and festivals can include chanting, offerings, and scripture reading. These rites are performed mainly by ritual masters who have trained extensively for this role and may intercede on behalf of laypersons through their mastery of ritual.\nThere are various kinds of festivals in Ceremonial Taoism, including \"Great Services\" (chai-chiao) and Ritual Gatherings (fa-hui) that can last for days and can focus on repentance, rainmaking, disaster aversion, or petitioning. There are feast days that honor specific deities. 164 Funerals and birthday blessings are a common service.\nThere is a complex and large pantheon in Taoism. It includes various deities classified into various ranks within an administrative structure, at the top of which are the celestial lords (t'ien-tsun). These include judges, heralds, officers, generals, clerks, and messengers. The main division is between \"earlier heaven\" deities, who have existed since the beginning of time, and \"later heaven\" deities, mortals who later became immortal.\n146 Key earlier heaven deities include the Three Pure Ones, the Jade Emperor, the Queen Mother of the West, the Mother of the Bushel of Stars, the Seven Star Lords of the Northern Bushel and the Three Officials (Celestial, Earth, and Water). Some key later heaven deities include: Immortal Lu Tung-pin, and Emperor Kuan (Kuan-yu). Taoists may also honor local spirits and deities, as well as Buddhist deities (like Guanyin, Amitabha, etc.).\nThe largest and most prominent sect of Ceremonial Taoism is the Way of the Celestial Masters, also known as Zhengyi Dao. The patriarch of this sect resides in Taiwan, and this tradition performs numerous ceremonies, which the Taiwanese government often sponsors. The training for the Zhengyi priesthood, who are not celibate, focuses mainly on learning extensive rituals and liturgy to perform them flawlessly.\nCeremonies are practiced, to a lesser extent, in the Longmen (Dragon Gate) sect of the Quanzhen School and in the Xiantiandao sect. However, these schools understand ritual as mainly a way to develop internal alchemy. During the Song dynasty, a popular form of ceremonial Taoism was the Thunder Rites (leifa), which focused on exorcism and protection.\nInternal alchemy.\nInternal Alchemy Taoism, or Transformation Taoism, focuses on internal transformation through the use of various self-cultivation techniques like qigong, neidan (internal alchemy), Yangsheng, and so forth.\nThe basic worldview of this Taoist tradition is that all beings are born with certain forms of energy (mainly the three treasures of jing, qi, and shen), which become dissipated, weak, and lost as we age. To prevent this and to increase our inner vital energies, one must practice various methods of \"internal alchemy\" (neidan) to harmonize the internal energy in one's body and refine the \"golden elixir\" (jindan) inside the body. These meditative inner alchemical practices are believed to lead to greater longevity and even immortality (union with the Tao at death).\nAnother worldview is that beings must \"harmonize \"yin\" and \"yang\" forces internally to achieve immortality.\"\n A term used by some Taoists that sums up traditions that do not use these practices is \"singular path\". Most traditions follow the \"singular path\". These include the Longmen (Dragon Gate) sect of the Quanzhen School, the Xiantiandao (Earlier Heaven Way) sect, the Wuliupai sect, and the Wudang quan sect.\nThe Quanzhen School was founded by Wang Chongyang (1112\u20131170), a hermit in the Zhongnan mountains who was said in legends to have met and learned secret methods from two immortals: Lu Dongbin and Zhongli Quan. He then moved to Shandong and preached his teachings, founding various religious communities. His school popularized Internal Alchemy Taoism and the usage of the term.\nOne of his \"seven perfected\" disciples, Qiu Chuji (1148\u20131227), founded the Dragon Gate lineage. Chuji was also made the leader of all religions in China by Genghis Khan, making his tradition the most powerful in China and contributing to Longmen's lasting influence. Another important Quanzhen lineage is the Qingjing pai, founded by the nun Sun Bu'er (1119\u20131182), the only female member of the \"seven perfected\". Today, Quanzhen is mainly made up of celibate monastics who practice vegetarianism, sobriety, internal alchemy, and recite daily liturgies. The largest lineage is Dragon Gate Taoism.\nMuch like Taoists who see writings made by influential members of their faith as having a divine nature, some Taoists view self-cultivation as a way for emotions and self to partake in divinity, and a smaller subset of these view some mythological beings such as \"xian\" as being divine. Xian were viewed in many lights and as completely different types of beings over different times and in different places. They were sometimes viewed as deities, parts of the celestial hierarchy, metaphorical ideals that people should strive to be like, reclusive Taoist masters who know how to control and harness spiritual energies, or shamans.\nHygiene Taoism.\nHygiene Taoism is a Taoist tradition meant to increase life and \"physical and mental harmony\". Some Taoists from the \"Hygiene School\" believed that they could survive only on their own breath and saliva to purify their bodies.\nMuch of Taoism in general is about cleanliness in some way and involves free thinking, as well as rejecting the gratification of the senses, in order to purify oneself to make the mind like \"the sky\", \"sun\", and nature in general.\nKarmic Taoism.\nAccording to Wong, Karmic Taoism, or \"Action and Karma Taoism, \" focuses on ethics and is grounded in the idea that the sacred celestial powers aid and reward those who do good and punish those who do evil. This tradition can be traced back to Song dynasty Taoist Li Ying-chang and his Laozu Treatise on the Response of the Tao (T'ai-shang kan-ying p'ien). Li sparked a popular movement which focused on the everyday life of ordinary persons instead of on temples, monasteries, and sages. At the core of this tradition is living in harmony with the Tao and the Way of Heaven, which means acting with benevolence, kindness, and compassion. Doing evil is considered a transgression against the way, and this evil will be punished by deities, celestial ministers, and judges.\nThe Taiping Jing (Scripture of Great Peace) states these ideas are quite ancient: \"accumulate good deeds, and prosperity will come to you from the Tao\". Besides wealth and prosperity, Karmic Taoism also believes that doing good increases longevity, while doing evil decreases it. Another common idea in this group of Taoist traditions is that there are deities, like the Kitchen Lord, who monitor our actions and report to Heaven and the Jade Emperor (who tallies them and metes out punishment and reward).\nKarmic Taoism is a nonsectarian tradition adopted by many Taoist sects. The Laozu Treatise on the Response of the Tao is studied in Quanzhen Taoism, Hsien-t'ien Tao, and in the Wu-Liu sect. All major schools of Taoism view ethics as the foundation for spirituality. Furthermore, some who are not affiliated with a Taoist sect may still follow Karmic Taoism in daily life.\nOther divisions of Taoism.\nTaoism has traditionally been divided into religious Taoism and philosophical Taoism (D\u00e0oji\u00e0o and D\u00e0oji\u0101), respectively.\nReligious Taoism.\nSome Taoist sects are expressly religious in the Western sense. \"Lord Heaven\" and \"Jade Emperor\" were terms for a Taoist supreme deity also used in Confucianism and Chinese folk religion, and some conceptions of this deity thought of the two names as synonymous.\nThe Taoist Jade Emperor in the first millennium AD was a primary deity among polytheists who had a heaven that contained numerous ministries and officials and which was \"modelled on...the earthly emperor['s rule]\".\nPolytheist Taoists venerated one or more of these kinds of spiritual entities: \"deified heroes...forces of nature\" and \"nature spirits\", \"xian\", spirits, gods, devas and other celestial beings from Chinese Buddhism, Indian Buddhism, and Chinese folk religion, various kinds of beings occupying heaven, members of the celestial bureaucracy, ghosts, \"mythical emperors\", Laozi, a trinity of high gods that varied in how it was thought of, and the Three Pure Ones. Some Taoists chose not to worship beings they saw as gods, and only worshipped guardian spirits or \"celestials\", such as devas, various kinds of beings occupying heaven, members of the celestial bureaucracy, and \"xian\". In some Taoist sects, the Tao was the primary thing that was venerated and beings that would be gods in other sects were merely treated as supernatural beings similar to gods who could only act in accordance with the Tao's wishes.\nWhen the \"Tao Te Ching\" was written, many Taoists told stories and legends about heroes \"whose bodies had been rendered invulnerable\". This could be achieved by making contact with \"dragon's blood\" or a river in the afterlife, or drinking the \"waters of the 'Well of Life' and eating the 'fungus of immortality'\".\nOrdinary Chinese in the early Tang dynasty often worshipped local gods, Buddhist gods and devas, and Taoist gods simultaneously, and this population included a significant amount of the Taoists who have ever worshipped devas throughout history.\nThe trinity is thought by scholars to have evolved into the Three Pure Ones. It was thought of in the early Han dynasty as the three gods Tianyi, Diyi, and \"the Taiyi\". These beings were varyingly interpreted as relatively simple heavenly, earthly, and all-purpose gods respectively, the \"supreme deity\" (an intangible god that represented the mind of the Tao), \"his disciple\", the Lord Tao (a more physical god representing the Tao), and Lord Lao (Laozi \"deified\"), or an emanation of the Tao that was ultimately singular in nature.\nAn unrelated trinity was the Three Great Emperor-Officials, three of the highest \"shen\" in some branches of religious Taoism thought to be able to pardon sins.\nThe Tao was not worshipped alone, although gods do exist that anthropomorphize it in various ways. Laozi was sometimes thought to be a god or \"the image of the Tao\".\n\"Some Taoist adepts\" worshipped thousands of gods thought to exist in the body.\nSee also.\nSchools and organizations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nConcepts and objects.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPractice.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nDeities.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTexts.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nRegional Taoism.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Thus one torr is exactly pascals (\u2248 ).\nHistorically, one torr was intended to be the same as one \"millimetre of mercury\", but subsequent redefinitions of the two units made the torr marginally lower (by less than 0.000015%).\nThe torr is not part of the International System of Units (SI). Even so, it is often combined with the metric prefix milli to name one millitorr (mTorr), equal to 0.001\u00a0Torr.\nThe unit was named after Evangelista Torricelli, an Italian physicist and mathematician who discovered the principle of the barometer in 1644.\nNomenclature and common errors.\nThe unit name \"torr\" is written in lower case, while its symbol (\"Torr\") is always written with an uppercase initial; including in combinations with prefixes and other unit symbols, as in \"mTorr\" (millitorr) or \"Torr\u22c5L/s\" (torr-litres per second). The symbol (uppercase) should be used with prefix symbols (thus, mTorr and millitorr are correct, but mtorr and milliTorr are not).\nThe torr is sometimes incorrectly denoted by the symbol \"T\", which is the SI symbol for the tesla, the unit measuring the strength of a magnetic field. Although frequently encountered, the alternative spelling \"Tor\" is incorrect.\nHistory.\nTorricelli attracted considerable attention when he demonstrated the first mercury barometer to the general public. He is credited with giving the first modern explanation of atmospheric pressure. Scientists at the time were familiar with small fluctuations in height that occurred in barometers. When these fluctuations were explained as a manifestation of changes in atmospheric pressure, the science of meteorology was enabled.\nOver time, 760 millimetres of mercury at 0\u00a0\u00b0C came to be regarded as the standard atmospheric pressure. In honour of Torricelli, the torr was defined as a unit of pressure equal to one millimetre of mercury at 0\u00a0\u00b0C. However, since the acceleration due to gravity \u2013 and thus the weight of a column of mercury \u2013 is a function of elevation and latitude (due to the rotation and non-sphericity of the Earth), this definition is imprecise and varies by location.\nIn 1954, the definition of the \"atmosphere\" was revised by the 10th General Conference on Weights and Measures to the currently accepted definition: one atmosphere is equal to 101325 pascals. The torr was then redefined as of one atmosphere. This yields a precise definition that is unambiguous and independent of measurements of the density of mercury or the acceleration due to gravity on Earth.\nManometric units of pressure.\n\"Manometric units\" are units such as \"millimetres of mercury\" or \"centimetres of water\" that depend on an assumed density of a fluid and an assumed acceleration due to gravity. The use of these units is discouraged. Nevertheless, manometric units are routinely used in medicine and physiology, and they continue to be used in areas as diverse as weather reporting and scuba diving.\nConversion factors.\nThe millimetre of mercury by definition is 133.322387415 Pa (13.5951 g/cm3 \u00d7 9.80665 m/s2 \u00d7 1 mm), which is approximated with known accuracies of density of mercury and standard gravity.\nThe torr is defined as of one standard atmosphere, while the atmosphere is defined as 101325 pascals. Therefore, 1 Torr is equal to \u00a0Pa. The decimal form of this fraction () is an infinitely long, periodically repeating decimal (repetend length: 18).\nThe relationship between the torr and the millimetre of mercury is:\nThe difference between one millimetre of mercury and one torr, as well as between one atmosphere (101.325\u00a0kPa) and 760\u00a0mmHg (101.3250144354 kPa), is less than one part in seven million (or less than 0.000015%). This small difference is negligible for all practical purposes.\nIn the European Union, the millimetre of mercury is defined as\n1 mmHg = 133.322 Pa\nhence\nOther units of pressure include:\nThese four pressure units are used in different settings. For example, the bar is used in meteorology to report atmospheric pressures. The torr is used in high-vacuum physics and engineering.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "30367", "revid": "4754841", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30367", "title": "Trigonometric functions", "text": "Functions of an angle\nIn mathematics, the trigonometric functions (also called circular functions, angle functions or goniometric functions) are real functions which relate an angle of a right-angled triangle to ratios of two side lengths. They are widely used in all sciences that are related to geometry, such as navigation, solid mechanics, celestial mechanics, geodesy, and many others. They are among the simplest periodic functions, and are widely used for studying periodic phenomena through Fourier analysis.\nThe trigonometric functions most widely used in modern mathematics are the sine, the cosine, and the tangent functions. Their reciprocals are respectively the cosecant, the secant, and the cotangent functions, which are less used. Each of these six trigonometric functions has a corresponding inverse function and has an analog among the hyperbolic functions.\nThe oldest definitions of trigonometric functions, related to right-angle triangles, define them only for acute angles. To extend the sine and cosine functions to functions whose domain is the whole real line, geometrical definitions using the standard unit circle (i.e., a circle with radius 1 unit) are often used; then the domain of the other functions is the real line with some isolated points removed. Modern definitions express trigonometric functions as infinite series or as solutions of differential equations. This allows extending the domain of sine and cosine functions to the whole complex plane, and the domain of the other trigonometric functions to the complex plane with some isolated points removed.\nNotation.\nConventionally, an abbreviation of each trigonometric function's name is used as its symbol in formulas. Today, the most common versions of these abbreviations are \"sin\" for sine, \"cos\" for cosine, \"tan\" or \"tg\" for tangent, \"sec\" for secant, \"csc\" or \"cosec\" for cosecant, and \"cot\" or \"ctg\" for cotangent. Historically, these abbreviations were first used in prose sentences to indicate particular line segments or their lengths related to an arc of an arbitrary circle, and later to indicate ratios of lengths, but as the function concept developed in the 17th\u201318th century, they began to be considered as functions of real-number-valued angle measures, and written with functional notation, for example sin(\"x\"). Parentheses are still often omitted to reduce clutter, but are sometimes necessary; for example the expression formula_1 would typically be interpreted to mean formula_2 so parentheses are required to express formula_3\nA positive integer appearing as a superscript after the symbol of the function denotes exponentiation, not function composition. For example formula_4 and formula_5 denote formula_6 not formula_7 This differs from the (historically later) general functional notation in which formula_8\nIn contrast, the superscript formula_9 is commonly used to denote the inverse function, not the reciprocal. For example formula_10 and formula_11 denote the inverse trigonometric function alternatively written formula_12 The equation formula_13 implies formula_14 not formula_15 In this case, the superscript \"could\" be considered as denoting a composed or iterated function, but negative superscripts other than formula_16 are not in common use.\nRight-angled triangle definitions.\nIf the acute angle \u03b8 is given, then any right triangles that have an angle of \u03b8 are similar to each other. This means that the ratio of any two side lengths depends only on \u03b8. Thus these six ratios define six functions of \u03b8, which are the trigonometric functions. In the following definitions, the hypotenuse is the length of the side opposite the right angle, \"opposite\" represents the side opposite the given angle \u03b8, and \"adjacent\" represents the side between the angle \u03b8 and the right angle.\nVarious mnemonics can be used to remember these definitions.\nIn a right-angled triangle, the sum of the two acute angles is a right angle, that is, 90\u00b0 or radians. Therefore formula_17 and formula_18 represent the same ratio, and thus are equal. This identity and analogous relationships between the other trigonometric functions are summarized in the following table.\nRadians versus degrees.\nIn geometric applications, the argument of a trigonometric function is generally the measure of an angle. For this purpose, any angular unit is convenient. One common unit is degrees, in which a right angle is 90\u00b0 and a complete turn is 360\u00b0 (particularly in elementary mathematics).\nHowever, in calculus and mathematical analysis, the trigonometric functions are generally regarded more abstractly as functions of real or complex numbers, rather than angles. In fact, the functions sin and cos can be defined for all complex numbers in terms of the exponential function, via power series, or as solutions to differential equations given particular initial values (\"see below\"), without reference to any geometric notions. The other four trigonometric functions (tan, cot, sec, csc) can be defined as quotients and reciprocals of sin and cos, except where zero occurs in the denominator. It can be proved, for real arguments, that these definitions coincide with elementary geometric definitions if the argument is regarded as an angle in radians. Moreover, these definitions result in simple expressions for the derivatives and indefinite integrals for the trigonometric functions. Thus, in settings beyond elementary geometry, radians are regarded as the mathematically natural unit for describing angle measures.\nWhen radians (rad) are employed, the angle is given as the length of the arc of the unit circle subtended by it: the angle that subtends an arc of length 1 on the unit circle is 1 rad (\u2248 57.3\u00b0), and a complete turn (360\u00b0) is an angle of 2\u03c0 (\u2248 6.28) rad. Since radian is dimensionless, i.e. 1 rad = 1, the degree symbol can also be regarded as a mathematical constant factor such that 1\u00b0 = \u03c0/180 \u2248 0.0175.\nUnit-circle definitions.\nThe six trigonometric functions can be defined as coordinate values of points on the Euclidean plane that are related to the unit circle, which is the circle of radius one centered at the origin O of this coordinate system. While right-angled triangle definitions allow for the definition of the trigonometric functions for angles between 0 and formula_19 radians (90\u00b0), the unit circle definitions allow the domain of trigonometric functions to be extended to all positive and negative real numbers.\nLet formula_20 be the ray obtained by rotating by an angle \u03b8 the positive half of the x-axis (counterclockwise rotation for formula_21 and clockwise rotation for formula_22). This ray intersects the unit circle at the point formula_23 The ray formula_24 extended to a line if necessary, intersects the line of equation formula_25 at point formula_26 and the line of equation formula_27 at point formula_28 The tangent line to the unit circle at the point A, is perpendicular to formula_24 and intersects the y- and x-axes at points formula_30 and formula_31 The coordinates of these points give the values of all trigonometric functions for any arbitrary real value of \u03b8 in the following manner.\nThe trigonometric functions cos and sin are defined, respectively, as the x- and y-coordinate values of point A. That is,\nformula_32 and formula_33\nIn the range formula_34, this definition coincides with the right-angled triangle definition, by taking the right-angled triangle to have the unit radius OA as hypotenuse. And since the equation formula_35 holds for all points formula_36 on the unit circle, this definition of cosine and sine also satisfies the Pythagorean identity.\nformula_37\nThe other trigonometric functions can be found along the unit circle as \nformula_38 and formula_39\nformula_40 and formula_41\nBy applying the Pythagorean identity and geometric proof methods, these definitions can readily be shown to coincide with the definitions of tangent, cotangent, secant and cosecant in terms of sine and cosine, that is\nformula_42\nSince a rotation of an angle of formula_43 does not change the position or size of a shape, the points A, B, C, D, and E are the same for two angles whose difference is an integer multiple of formula_44. Thus trigonometric functions are periodic functions with period formula_44. That is, the equalities\nformula_46 and formula_47\nhold for any angle \u03b8 and any integer k. The same is true for the four other trigonometric functions. By observing the sign and the monotonicity of the functions sine, cosine, cosecant, and secant in the four quadrants, one can show that formula_44 is the smallest value for which they are periodic (i.e., formula_44 is the fundamental period of these functions). However, after a rotation by an angle formula_50, the points B and C already return to their original position, so that the tangent function and the cotangent function have a fundamental period of formula_50. That is, the equalities\nformula_52 and formula_53\nhold for any angle \u03b8 and any integer k.\nAlgebraic values.\nThe algebraic expressions for the most important angles are as follows:\nformula_54 (zero angle)\nformula_55\nformula_56\nformula_57\nformula_58 (right angle)\nWriting the numerators as square roots of consecutive non-negative integers, with a denominator of 2, provides an easy way to remember the values.\nSuch simple expressions generally do not exist for other angles which are rational multiples of a right angle.\nSimple algebraic values.\nThe following table lists the sines, cosines, and tangents of multiples of 15 degrees from 0 to 90 degrees.\nDefinitions in analysis.\nG. H. Hardy noted in his 1908 work \"A Course of Pure Mathematics\" that the definition of the trigonometric functions in terms of the unit circle is not satisfactory, because it depends implicitly on a notion of angle that can be measured by a real number. Thus in modern analysis, trigonometric functions are usually constructed without reference to geometry.\nVarious ways exist in the literature for defining the trigonometric functions in a manner suitable for analysis; they include:\nDefinition by differential equations.\nSine and cosine can be defined as the unique solution to the initial value problem:\nformula_59\nDifferentiating again, formula_60 and formula_61, so both sine and cosine are solutions of the same ordinary differential equation\nformula_62\nSine is the unique solution with \"y\"(0) \n 0 and \"y\"\u2032(0) \n 1; cosine is the unique solution with \"y\"(0) \n 1 and \"y\"\u2032(0) \n 0.\nOne can then prove, as a theorem, that solutions formula_63 are periodic, having the same period. Writing this period as formula_44 is then a definition of the real number formula_50 which is independent of geometry.\nApplying the quotient rule to the tangent formula_66, \nformula_67\nso the tangent function satisfies the ordinary differential equation\nformula_68\nIt is the unique solution with \"y\"(0) \n 0.\nPower series expansion.\nThe basic trigonometric functions can be defined by the following power series expansions. These series are also known as the Taylor series or Maclaurin series of these trigonometric functions:\nformula_69\nThe radius of convergence of these series is infinite. Therefore, the sine and the cosine can be extended to entire functions (also called \"sine\" and \"cosine\"), which are (by definition) complex-valued functions that are defined and holomorphic on the whole complex plane.\nTerm-by-term differentiation shows that the sine and cosine defined by the series obey the differential equation discussed previously, and conversely one can obtain these series from elementary recursion relations derived from the differential equation.\nBeing defined as fractions of entire functions, the other trigonometric functions may be extended to meromorphic functions, that is functions that are holomorphic in the whole complex plane, except some isolated points called poles. Here, the poles are the numbers of the form formula_70 for the tangent and the secant, or formula_71 for the cotangent and the cosecant, where k is an arbitrary integer.\nRecurrences relations may also be computed for the coefficients of the Taylor series of the other trigonometric functions. These series have a finite radius of convergence. Their coefficients have a combinatorial interpretation: they enumerate alternating permutations of finite sets.\nMore precisely, defining\n Un, the n-th up/down number,\n Bn, the n-th Bernoulli number, and\n En, is the n-th Euler number,\none has the following series expansions: \nformula_72\nformula_73\nformula_74\nformula_75\nContinued fraction expansion.\nThe following continued fractions are valid in the whole complex plane:\nformula_76\nformula_77\nformula_78\nThe last one was used in the historically first proof that \u03c0 is irrational.\nThere is a rapidly convergent continued fraction for formula_79:\nformula_80\nLet formula_25 then the following continued fraction representation gives (asymptotically) 12.68 new correct decimal places per cycle:\nformula_82\nPartial fraction expansion.\nThere is a series representation as partial fraction expansion where just translated reciprocal functions are summed up, such that the poles of the cotangent function and the reciprocal functions match:\nformula_83\nThis identity can be proved with the Herglotz trick.\nCombining the (\u2013\"n\")-th with the n-th term lead to absolutely convergent series:\nformula_84\nSimilarly, one can find a partial fraction expansion for the secant, cosecant and tangent functions:\nformula_85\nformula_86\nformula_87\nformula_88\nInfinite product expansion.\nThe following infinite product for the sine is due to Leonhard Euler, and is of great importance in complex analysis:\nformula_89\nThis may be obtained from the partial fraction decomposition of formula_90 given above, which is the logarithmic derivative of formula_91. From this, it can be deduced also that\nformula_92\nEuler's formula and the exponential function.\nEuler's formula relates sine and cosine to the exponential function:\nformula_93 \nThis formula is commonly considered for real values of x, but it remains true for all complex values.\n\"Proof\": Let formula_94 and formula_95 One has formula_96 for \"j\" = 1, 2. The quotient rule implies thus that formula_97. Therefore, formula_98 is a constant function, which equals , as formula_99 This proves the formula.\nOne has\nformula_100\nSolving this linear system in sine and cosine, one can express them in terms of the exponential function:\nformula_101\nWhen x is real, this may be rewritten as \nformula_102\nMost trigonometric identities can be proved by expressing trigonometric functions in terms of the complex exponential function by using above formulas, and then using the identity formula_103 for simplifying the result.\nEuler's formula can also be used to define the basic trigonometric function directly, as follows, using the language of topological groups. The set formula_104 of complex numbers of unit modulus is a compact and connected topological group, which has a neighborhood of the identity that is homeomorphic to the real line. Therefore, it is isomorphic as a topological group to the one-dimensional torus group formula_105, via an isomorphism\nformula_106\nIn simple terms, formula_107, and this isomorphism is unique up to taking complex conjugates.\nFor a nonzero real number formula_108 (the \"base\"), the function formula_109 defines an isomorphism of the group formula_110. The real and imaginary parts of formula_111 are the cosine and sine, where formula_108 is used as the base for measuring angles. For example, when formula_113, we get the measure in radians, and the usual trigonometric functions. When formula_114, we get the sine and cosine of angles measured in degrees.\nNote that formula_113 is the unique value at which the derivative \nformula_116 \nbecomes a unit vector with positive imaginary part at formula_117. This fact can, in turn, be used to define the constant formula_44.\nDefinition via integration.\nAnother way to define the trigonometric functions in analysis is using integration. For a real number formula_119, put\nformula_120\nwhere this defines this inverse tangent function. Also, formula_50 is defined by\nformula_122\na definition that goes back to Karl Weierstrass.\nOn the interval formula_123, the trigonometric functions are defined by inverting the relation formula_124. Thus we define the trigonometric functions by\nformula_125\nwhere the point formula_126 is on the graph of formula_127 and the positive square root is taken.\nThis defines the trigonometric functions on formula_128. The definition can be extended to all real numbers by first observing that, as formula_129, formula_130, and so formula_131 and formula_132. Thus formula_133 and formula_134 are extended continuously so that formula_135. Now the conditions formula_136 and formula_137 define the sine and cosine as periodic functions with period formula_44, for all real numbers.\nProving the basic properties of sine and cosine, including the fact that sine and cosine are analytic, one may first establish the addition formulae. First,\nformula_139\nholds, provided formula_140, since\nformula_141\nafter the substitution formula_142. In particular, the limiting case as formula_143 gives\nformula_144\nThus we have\nformula_145\nand\nformula_146\nSo the sine and cosine functions are related by translation over a quarter period formula_147.\nDefinitions using functional equations.\nOne can also define the trigonometric functions using various functional equations.\nFor example, the sine and the cosine form the unique pair of continuous functions that satisfy the difference formula\nformula_148\nand the added condition\nformula_149\nIn the complex plane.\nThe sine and cosine of a complex number formula_150 can be expressed in terms of real sines, cosines, and hyperbolic functions as follows:\nformula_151\nBy taking advantage of domain coloring, it is possible to graph the trigonometric functions as complex-valued functions. Various features unique to the complex functions can be seen from the graph; for example, the sine and cosine functions can be seen to be unbounded as the imaginary part of formula_152 becomes larger (since the color white represents infinity), and the fact that the functions contain simple zeros or poles is apparent from the fact that the hue cycles around each zero or pole exactly once. Comparing these graphs with those of the corresponding Hyperbolic functions highlights the relationships between the two.\nPeriodicity and asymptotes.\nThe sine and cosine functions are periodic, with period formula_44, which is the smallest positive period:\nformula_154\nConsequently, the cosecant and secant also have formula_44 as their period. \nThe functions sine and cosine also have semiperiods formula_50, and\nformula_157\nand consequently\nformula_158\nAlso, \nformula_159\n(see Complementary angles).\nThe function formula_160 has a unique zero (at formula_161) in the strip formula_162. The function formula_163 has the pair of zeros formula_164 in the same strip. Because of the periodicity, the zeros of sine are \nformula_165\nThere zeros of cosine are\nformula_166\nAll of the zeros are simple zeros, and both functions have derivative formula_167 at each of the zeros.\nThe tangent function formula_168 has a simple zero at formula_161 and vertical asymptotes at formula_164, where it has a simple pole of residue formula_9. Again, owing to the periodicity, the zeros are all the integer multiples of formula_50 and the poles are odd multiples of formula_147, all having the same residue. The poles correspond to vertical asymptotes\nformula_174\nThe cotangent function formula_175 has a simple pole of residue 1 at the integer multiples of formula_50 and simple zeros at odd multiples of formula_147. The poles correspond to vertical asymptotes\nformula_178\nBasic identities.\nMany identities interrelate the trigonometric functions. This section contains the most basic ones; for more identities, see List of trigonometric identities. These identities may be proved geometrically from the unit-circle definitions or the right-angled-triangle definitions (although, for the latter definitions, care must be taken for angles that are not in the interval , see Proofs of trigonometric identities). For non-geometrical proofs using only tools of calculus, one may use directly the differential equations, in a way that is similar to that of the above proof of Euler's identity. One can also use Euler's identity for expressing all trigonometric functions in terms of complex exponentials and using properties of the exponential function.\nParity.\nThe cosine and the secant are even functions; the other trigonometric functions are odd functions. That is:\nformula_179\nPeriods.\nAll trigonometric functions are periodic functions of period . This is the smallest period, except for the tangent and the cotangent, which have \u03c0 as smallest period. This means that, for every integer k, one has\nformula_180\nSee Periodicity and asymptotes.\nPythagorean identity.\nThe Pythagorean identity, is the expression of the Pythagorean theorem in terms of trigonometric functions. It is \nformula_181.\nDividing through by either formula_182 or formula_4 gives\nformula_184\nformula_185\nand\nformula_186.\nSum and difference formulas.\nThe sum and difference formulas allow expanding the sine, the cosine, and the tangent of a sum or a difference of two angles in terms of sines and cosines and tangents of the angles themselves. These can be derived geometrically, using arguments that date to Ptolemy (see Angle sum and difference identities). One can also produce them algebraically using Euler's formula.\nformula_187\nformula_188\nWhen the two angles are equal, the sum formulas reduce to simpler equations known as the double-angle formulae.\nformula_189\nThese identities can be used to derive the product-to-sum identities.\nBy setting formula_190 (see half-angle formulae), all trigonometric functions of formula_191 can be expressed as rational fractions of formula_119:\nformula_193\nTogether with \nformula_194\nthis is the tangent half-angle substitution, which reduces the computation of integrals and antiderivatives of trigonometric functions to that of rational fractions.\nDerivatives and antiderivatives.\nThe derivatives of trigonometric functions result from those of sine and cosine by applying the quotient rule. The values given for the antiderivatives in the following table can be verified by differentiating them. The number\u00a0C is a constant of integration.\nNote: For formula_195 the integral of formula_196 can also be written as formula_197 and the integral of formula_198 for formula_199 as formula_200 where formula_201 is the inverse hyperbolic sine.\nAlternatively, the derivatives of the 'co-functions' can be obtained using trigonometric identities and the chain rule:\nformula_202\nInverse functions.\nThe trigonometric functions are periodic, and hence not injective, so strictly speaking, they do not have an inverse function. However, on each interval on which a trigonometric function is monotonic, one can define an inverse function, and this defines inverse trigonometric functions as multivalued functions. To define a true inverse function, one must restrict the domain to an interval where the function is monotonic, and is thus bijective from this interval to its image by the function. The common choice for this interval, called the set of principal values, is given in the following table. As usual, the inverse trigonometric functions are denoted with the prefix \"arc\" before the name or its abbreviation of the function.\nThe notations sin\u22121, cos\u22121, etc. are often used for arcsin and arccos, etc. When this notation is used, inverse functions could be confused with multiplicative inverses. The notation with the \"arc\" prefix avoids such a confusion, though \"arcsec\" for arcsecant can be confused with \"arcsecond\".\nJust like the sine and cosine, the inverse trigonometric functions can also be expressed in terms of infinite series. They can also be expressed in terms of complex logarithms.\nApplications.\nAngles and sides of a triangle.\nIn this section A, B, C denote the three (interior) angles of a triangle, and a, b, c denote the lengths of the respective opposite edges. They are related by various formulas, which are named by the trigonometric functions they involve.\nLaw of sines.\nThe law of sines states that for an arbitrary triangle with sides a, b, and c and angles opposite those sides A, B and C:\nformula_203\nwhere \u0394 is the area of the triangle,\nor, equivalently,\nformula_204\nwhere R is the triangle's circumradius.\nIt can be proved by dividing the triangle into two right ones and using the above definition of sine. The law of sines is useful for computing the lengths of the unknown sides in a triangle if two angles and one side are known. This is a common situation occurring in \"triangulation\", a technique to determine unknown distances by measuring two angles and an accessible enclosed distance.\nLaw of cosines.\nThe law of cosines (also known as the cosine formula or cosine rule) is an extension of the Pythagorean theorem:\nformula_205\nor equivalently,\nformula_206\nIn this formula the angle at C is opposite to the side\u00a0c. This theorem can be proved by dividing the triangle into two right ones and using the Pythagorean theorem.\nThe law of cosines can be used to determine a side of a triangle if two sides and the angle between them are known. It can also be used to find the cosines of an angle (and consequently the angles themselves) if the lengths of all the sides are known.\nLaw of tangents.\nThe law of tangents says that:\nformula_207.\nLaw of cotangents.\nIf s is the triangle's semiperimeter, (\"a\" + \"b\" + \"c\")/2, and r is the radius of the triangle's incircle, then \"rs\" is the triangle's area. Therefore Heron's formula implies that:\nformula_208.\nThe law of cotangents says that:\nformula_209\nIt follows that\nformula_210\nPeriodic functions.\nThe trigonometric functions are also important in physics. The sine and the cosine functions, for example, are used to describe simple harmonic motion, which models many natural phenomena, such as the movement of a mass attached to a spring and, for small angles, the pendular motion of a mass hanging by a string. The sine and cosine functions are one-dimensional projections of uniform circular motion.\nTrigonometric functions also prove to be useful in the study of general periodic functions. The characteristic wave patterns of periodic functions are useful for modeling recurring phenomena such as sound or light waves.\nUnder rather general conditions, a periodic function \"f\"&amp;hairsp;(\"x\") can be expressed as a sum of sine waves or cosine waves in a Fourier series. Denoting the sine or cosine basis functions by \u03c6k, the expansion of the periodic function \"f\"&amp;hairsp;(\"t\") takes the form:\nformula_211\nFor example, the square wave can be written as the Fourier series\nformula_212\nIn the animation of a square wave at top right it can be seen that just a few terms already produce a fairly good approximation. The superposition of several terms in the expansion of a sawtooth wave are shown underneath.\nHistory.\nWhile the early study of trigonometry can be traced to antiquity, the trigonometric functions as they are in use today were developed in the medieval period. The chord function was defined by Hipparchus of Nicaea (180\u2013125\u00a0BCE) and Ptolemy of Roman Egypt (90\u2013165\u00a0CE). The functions of sine and versine (1 \u2212 cosine) are closely related to the \"jy\u0101\" and \"koti-jy\u0101\" functions used in Gupta period Indian astronomy (\"Aryabhatiya\", \"Surya Siddhanta\"), via translation from Sanskrit to Arabic and then from Arabic to Latin. (See Aryabhata's sine table.)\nAll six trigonometric functions in current use were known in Islamic mathematics by the 9th century, as was the law of sines, used in solving triangles. Al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b (c.\u2009780\u2013850) produced tables of sines and cosines. Circa 860, Habash al-Hasib al-Marwazi defined the tangent and the cotangent, and produced their tables. Muhammad ibn J\u0101bir al-Harr\u0101n\u012b al-Batt\u0101n\u012b (853\u2013929) defined the reciprocal functions of secant and cosecant, and produced the first table of cosecants for each degree from 1\u00b0 to 90\u00b0. The trigonometric functions were later studied by mathematicians including Omar Khayy\u00e1m, Bh\u0101skara II, Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, Jamsh\u012bd al-K\u0101sh\u012b (14th century), Ulugh Beg (14th century), Regiomontanus (1464), Rheticus, and Rheticus' student Valentinus Otho.\nMadhava of Sangamagrama (c. 1400) made early strides in the analysis of trigonometric functions in terms of infinite series. (See Madhava series and Madhava's sine table.)\nThe tangent function was brought to Europe by Giovanni Bianchini in 1467 in trigonometry tables he created to support the calculation of stellar coordinates. \nThe terms \"tangent\" and \"secant\" were first introduced by the Danish mathematician Thomas Fincke in his book \"Geometria rotundi\" (1583).\nThe 17th century French mathematician Albert Girard made the first published use of the abbreviations sin, cos, and tan in his book \"Trigonom\u00e9trie\".\nIn a paper published in 1682, Gottfried Leibniz proved that sin \"x\" is not an algebraic function of x. Though defined as ratios of sides of a right triangle, and thus appearing to be rational functions, Leibnitz result established that they are actually transcendental functions of their argument. The task of assimilating circular functions into algebraic expressions was accomplished by Euler in his \"Introduction to the Analysis of the Infinite\" (1748). His method was to show that the sine and cosine functions are alternating series formed from the even and odd terms respectively of the exponential series. He presented \"Euler's formula\", as well as near-modern abbreviations (sin., cos., tang., cot., sec., and cosec.).\nA few functions were common historically, but are now seldom used, such as the chord, versine (which appeared in the earliest tables), haversine, coversine, half-tangent (tangent of half an angle), and exsecant. List of trigonometric identities shows more relations between these functions.\nformula_213\nHistorically, trigonometric functions were often combined with logarithms in compound functions like the logarithmic sine, logarithmic cosine, logarithmic secant, logarithmic cosecant, logarithmic tangent and logarithmic cotangent.\nEtymology.\nThe word derives from Latin \"sinus\", meaning \"bend; bay\", and more specifically \"the hanging fold of the upper part of a toga\", \"the bosom of a garment\", which was chosen as the translation of what was interpreted as the Arabic word \"jaib\", meaning \"pocket\" or \"fold\" in the twelfth-century translations of works by Al-Battani and al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b into Medieval Latin.\nThe choice was based on a misreading of the Arabic written form \"j-y-b\" (), which itself originated as a transliteration from Sanskrit ', which along with its synonym ' (the standard Sanskrit term for the sine) translates to \"bowstring\", being in turn adopted from Ancient Greek \"string\".\nThe word \"tangent\" comes from Latin \"tangens\" meaning \"touching\", since the line \"touches\" the circle of unit radius, whereas \"secant\" stems from Latin \"secans\"\u2014\"cutting\"\u2014since the line \"cuts\" the circle.\nThe prefix \"co-\" (in \"cosine\", \"cotangent\", \"cosecant\") is found in Edmund Gunter's \"Canon triangulorum\" (1620), which defines the \"cosinus\" as an abbreviation of the \"sinus complementi\" (sine of the complementary angle) and proceeds to define the \"cotangens\" similarly.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A reaction may release or absorb energy, and a phase change may do the same. Thermochemistry focuses on the energy exchange between a system and its surroundings in the form of heat. Thermochemistry is useful in predicting reactant and product quantities throughout the course of a given reaction. In combination with entropy determinations, it is also used to predict whether a reaction is spontaneous or non-spontaneous, favorable or unfavorable.\nEndothermic reactions absorb heat, while exothermic reactions release heat. Thermochemistry coalesces the concepts of thermodynamics with the concept of energy in the form of chemical bonds. The subject commonly includes calculations of such quantities as heat capacity, heat of combustion, heat of formation, enthalpy, entropy, and free energy.\nThermochemistry is one part of the broader field of chemical thermodynamics, which deals with the exchange of all forms of energy between system and surroundings, including not only heat but also various forms of work, as well the exchange of matter. When all forms of energy are considered, the concepts of exothermic and endothermic reactions are generalized to exergonic reactions and endergonic reactions.\nHistory.\nThermochemistry rests on two generalizations. Stated in modern terms, they are as follows:\nThese statements preceded the first law of thermodynamics (1845) and helped in its formulation.\nThermochemistry also involves the measurement of the latent heat of phase transitions. Joseph Black had already introduced the concept of latent heat in 1761, based on the observation that heating ice at its melting point did not raise the temperature but instead caused some ice to melt.\nGustav Kirchhoff showed in 1858 that the variation of the heat of reaction is given by the difference in heat capacity between products and reactants: d\u0394H / dT = \u0394Cp. Integration of this equation permits the evaluation of the heat of reaction at one temperature from measurements at another temperature.\nCalorimetry.\nThe measurement of heat changes is performed using calorimetry, usually an enclosed chamber within which the change to be examined occurs. The temperature of the chamber is monitored either using a thermometer or thermocouple, and the temperature plotted against time to give a graph from which fundamental quantities can be calculated. Modern calorimeters are frequently supplied with automatic devices to provide a quick read-out of information, one example being the differential scanning calorimeter.\nSystems.\nSeveral thermodynamic definitions are very useful in thermochemistry. A system is the specific portion of the universe that is being studied. Everything outside the system is considered the surroundings or environment. A system may be:\nProcesses.\nA system undergoes a process when one or more of its properties changes. A process relates to the change of state. An isothermal (same-temperature) process occurs when temperature of the system remains constant. An isobaric (same-pressure) process occurs when the pressure of the system remains constant. A process is adiabatic when no heat exchange occurs."}

It is the world's tallest cantilevered observation wheel, and the most popular paid tourist attraction in the United Kingdom with over three million visitors annually. It has been featured numerous times in popular culture.\nThe structure is tall and the wheel has a diameter of . When it opened to the public in 2000 it was the world's tallest Ferris wheel, until the Star of Nanchang in China surpassed it in 2006. Unlike taller wheels, the Eye is cantilevered and supported solely by an A-frame on one side. The Eye was the highest public viewing point in London until 2013, when it was surpassed by the View from The Shard observation deck.\nThe London Eye adjoins the western end of Jubilee Gardens (previously the site of the former Dome of Discovery), on the South Bank of the River Thames between Westminster Bridge and Hungerford Bridge beside County Hall, in the London Borough of Lambeth. The nearest tube station is Waterloo.\nHistory.\nConception.\nThe London Eye was conceived by architects David Marks and Julia Barfield, a husband-and-wife team who met in 1972 while studying at the Architectural Association and living in squats in Stockwell, south London. After graduating, Barfield joined Norman Foster, contributing to projects such as the Royal Academy\u2019s Sackler Galleries and Stansted Airport, while Marks worked for Richard Rogers on the Lloyd\u2019s Building and the Inmos microprocessor factory. Both firms were leading exponents of high-tech architecture, noted for their innovative structural engineering and use of modern materials. The couple founded their own practice, Marks Barfield Architects, in 1989 following the birth of their first child, seeking a better work\u2013life balance.\nDuring the early 1990s recession, the firm struggled and took on small commissions such as kitchen extensions and brochure design. In 1993, Marks and Barfield entered a competition organised by \"The Sunday Times\" and the Architecture Foundation to design a landmark to commemorate the beginning of the third millennium. As entries were to be published in the newspaper, they saw it as a valuable opportunity for publicity.\nInspired by views of the BT Tower and the Crystal Palace transmitter on his daily commute, Marks conceived the idea of giving the public access to elevated views of London. The pair realised that a wheel could \u201cget people up high easily, efficiently and effortlessly\u201d while avoiding comparisons with the Eiffel Tower. Barfield suggested the South Bank for its central location and historic significance as the site of the Festival of Britain fifty years earlier. Together with structural engineer Jane Wernick of Arup, with whom they had previously collaborated, they submitted a concept for a wheel on the banks of the River Thames.\nThe competition ultimately concluded without a winner, as judges deemed none of the proposals sufficiently imaginative. \"We were narked. We had a great idea and no one was going to see it,\u201d Marks later recalled. Undeterred and encouraged by friends, the architects remortgaged their home and applied to Lambeth Council for outline planning permission.\nIn the summer of 1994, \"Evening Standard\" editor Stewart Steven and correspondent Mira Bar-Hillel launched a \"Back The Wheel\" campaign which attracted public support. In December that year, the project secured a major backer when Bob Ayling, chief executive of British Airways and a neighbour of Marks and Barfield, persuaded the airline to invest \u00a3600,000 in seed funding.\nThis investment enabled Marks Barfield to commission Arup to produce detailed engineering plans and to consult statutory bodies and local community groups. Planning permission for the Millennium Wheel was granted in 1996. After British banks declined to finance the project, funding was ultimately secured from the German bank Westdeutsche Landesbank and the Japanese conglomerate Sumitomo Corporation.\nDesign and construction.\nThe rim of the Eye is supported by tensioned steel cables and resembles a huge spoked bicycle wheel. The lighting was re-done with LED lighting from Color Kinetics in December 2006 to allow digital control of the lights as opposed to the manual replacement of gels over fluorescent tubes.\nMace was responsible for construction management, with Hollandia as the main steelwork contractor and Tilbury Douglas as the civil contractor. Consulting engineers Tony Gee &amp; Partners designed the foundation works while Beckett Rankine designed the marine works.\nNathaniel Lichfield and Partners assisted The Tussauds Group in obtaining planning and listed building consent to alter the wall on the South Bank of the Thames. They also examined and reported on the implications of a Section 106 agreement attached to the original contract, and also prepared planning and listed building consent applications for the permanent retention of the attraction, which involved the co-ordination of an Environmental Statement and the production of a planning supporting statement detailing the reasons for its retention.\nThe wheel was constructed in sections which were floated up the Thames on barges and assembled lying flat on piled platforms in the river. Once the wheel was complete it was lifted into an upright position by a strand jack system made by Enerpac. It was first raised at 2\u00a0degrees per hour until it reached 65\u00a0degrees, then left in that position for a week while engineers prepared for the second phase of the lift.\nThe project was European with major components coming from six countries: the steel was supplied from the UK and fabricated in the Netherlands by Hollandia, the cables came from Italy, the bearings came from Germany (FAG/Schaeffler Group), the spindle and hub were cast in the Czech Republic, the capsules were made by Poma in France (and the glass for these came from Italy), and the electrical components from the UK.\nOpening.\nThe London Eye was formally opened by the Prime Minister Tony Blair on 31 December 1999, but did not open to the paying public until 9 March 2000 because of a capsule clutch problem.\nThe London Eye was originally intended as a temporary attraction, with a five-year lease. In December 2001, operators submitted an application to Lambeth Council to give the London Eye permanent status, and the application was granted in July 2002.\nSouthbank Centre dispute.\nIn May 2005, there were reports of a leaked letter showing that the Southbank Centre (SBC)\u2014owners of part of the land on which the struts of the Eye are located\u2014had served a notice to quit on the attraction along with a demand for an increase in rent from \u00a365,000 per year to \u00a32.5\u00a0million, which the operator rejected as unaffordable.\nMayor Ken Livingstone pledged that if the dispute was not resolved he would ask the London Development Agency to issue a compulsory purchase order. The land in question is a small part of the Jubilee Gardens, which was given to the SBC for \u00a31 when the Greater London Council was broken up.\nIn February 2006, after a request for judicial review was refused, a new 25-year lease was agreed under which the SBC would receive a percentage of the London Eye's turnover, with a minimum of \u00a3500,000 per year.\nChange of ownership.\nArchitects Marks Barfield, the Tussauds Group, and British Airways were the original owners of the London Eye. Tussauds announced the acquisition of British Airways' share in 2005, then Marks Barfield's in 2006. The purchase gave Tussauds sole ownership and resolved debt owed to British Airways for construction costs, which stood at more than \u00a3175\u00a0million and had been charged at an interest rate of 25% per annum. Tussauds was later merged with Merlin Entertainments. \nContinued operations.\nIn 2009, a 4D cinema was added to the attraction.\nAs of 2025[ [update]], the attraction has carried over 85 million passengers.\nPassenger capsules.\nThe wheel's 32 sealed and air-conditioned ovoidal passenger capsules, designed and supplied by Poma, are attached to the external circumference of the wheel and rotated by electric motors. The capsules are numbered from 1 to 33, excluding number 13 for superstitious reasons. Each of the capsules represents one of the London boroughs, and holds up to 25 people, who are free to walk around inside the capsule, though seating is provided. The wheel rotates at per second (about 0.9\u00a0km/h or 0.6\u00a0mph) so that one revolution takes about 30\u00a0minutes, giving a theoretical capacity of 1,600 passengers per hour. It does not usually stop to take on passengers; the rotation rate is slow enough to allow passengers to walk on and off the moving capsules at ground level. It is stopped to allow disabled or elderly passengers time to embark and disembark safely.\nIn 2009, the first stage of a \u00a312.5\u00a0million capsule upgrade began. Each capsule was taken down and floated down the river to Tilbury Docks in Essex.\nOn 2 June 2013, a passenger capsule was named the Coronation Capsule to mark the 60th anniversary of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.\nIn March 2020, the London Eye celebrated its 20th birthday by turning several of its capsules into experiences themed around London. The experiences included a pub in a capsule, a West End theatre capsule and a garden party with flower arrangements to represent the eight London Royal Parks.\nSponsors.\nFrom the time of opening until 2008, the attraction was known as the British Airways London Eye under a naming rights deal. In August 2009, it was rebranded as the Merlin Entertainments London Eye, reflecting the name of its operator.\nEDF Energy became the sponsor in 2011, reportedly paying about \u00a32.5\u202fmillion a year. The deal coincided with its sponsorship of the London 2012 Olympic Games. A capsule was repainted bright orange to match the company's branding, but local councillors refused consent and requested it be restored to its original appearance.\nIn 2015, the attraction rebranded as the Coca-Cola London Eye, drawing criticism from children's health charities. Labour MP Keith Vaz urged the Government to intervene, condemning the \"irresponsible\" promotion of a high-sugar product \"at a time of record child obesity, rotten teeth and diabetes.\"\nIn 2020, the online travel retailer lastminute.com became the new sponsor, with the wheel illuminated at night in the brand\u2019s hot pink.\nCultural significance.\nThe London Eye has become widely regarded as a symbol of London. In a 2006 government-commissioned survey, it was also named an icon of modern England. Its image has been depicted inside British passports, in the moquette design on the seats of some London Underground trains, and in the closing ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics.\nThe structure serves as the focal point for London\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve celebrations; each year more than 2,000 fireworks are launched from the wheel itself during the televised display.\nBy 2013, reports indicated that at least 5,000 wedding proposals had taken place on the attraction.\nAt the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the London Eye joined other landmarks in illuminating in blue as part of the Clap for our Carers campaign in support of National Health Service staff.\nBeginning in the 2020s, The London Eye in collaboration with the New Crescent Society started to illimunate once the crescent moon was sighted for the Islamic month of Shawwal marking the beginning of the occasion of Eid Al Fitr.\nCritical reception.\nSir Richard Rogers, winner of the 2007 Pritzker Architecture Prize, wrote of the London Eye in a book about the project:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Eye has done for London what the Eiffel Tower did for Paris, which is to give it a symbol and to let people climb above the city and look back down on it. Not just specialists or rich people, but everybody. That's the beauty of it: it is public and accessible, and it is in a great position at the heart of London.\nTransport links.\nThe nearest London Underground station is Waterloo, although Charing Cross, Embankment, and Westminster are also within easy walking distance.\nConnection with National Rail services is made at London Waterloo station and London Waterloo East station.\nLondon River Services operated by Thames Clippers and City Cruises stop at the London Eye Pier.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Taekwondo also sometimes involves the use of weapons such as swords and nunchucks (nunchaku). Taekwondo practitioners wear a uniform known as a .\nTaekwondo is originally a martial art which was developed during the 1940s and 1950s by Korean martial artists with experience in martial arts such as karate and Chinese martial arts. In the early 1970s, a new style of Taekwondo was developed to promote it as a competitive sport, alongside its traditional martial arts form.\nThe oldest governing body for taekwondo is the Korea Taekwondo Association (KTA), formed in 1959 through a collaborative effort by representatives from the nine original \"kwans\", or martial arts schools, in Korea. The main international organizational bodies for taekwondo today are various branches of the International Taekwon-Do Federation (ITF), originally founded by Choi Hong-hi in 1966, and the partnership of the Kukkiwon and World Taekwondo (WT, formerly World Taekwondo Federation or WTF), founded in 1972 and 1973 respectively by the Korea Taekwondo Association. Gyeorugi (), a type of full-contact sparring, has been an Olympic event since 2000. In 2018, the South Korean government officially designated taekwondo as Korea's national martial art. At the Olympic and Paralympic level, taekwondo is governed by World Taekwondo.\nHistory.\nEmergence of various \"kwans\".\nBeginning in 1945, shortly after the end of World War II and the Japanese occupation, new martial arts schools called \"kwans\" opened in Seoul. These schools were established by Korean martial artists with backgrounds in Japanese and Chinese martial arts.\nEarly progenitors of taekwondo\u2014the founders of the nine original \"kwans\"\u2014who were able to study in Japan were exposed to Japanese martial arts, including karate, judo, and kendo, while others were exposed to the martial arts of China and Manchuria.\nDiscussions around the historical influences of taekwondo have been controversial, with two main schools of thought: traditionalism and revisionism. Traditionalism holds that the origins of taekwondo are indigenous while revisionism, the prevailing theory, argues that taekwondo is rooted in karate. In later years, the Korean government has been a significant supporter of traditionalist views as to divorce taekwondo from its link to Japan and give Korea a \"legitimate cultural past\".\nAttempt to standardize taekwondo.\nIn 1952, South Korean president Syngman Rhee witnessed a martial arts demonstration by South Korean Army officers Choi Hong-hi and Nam Tae-hi from the 29th Infantry Division. He misrecognized the technique on display as taekkyon, and urged martial arts to be introduced to the army under a single system. Beginning in 1955 the leaders of the \"kwans\" began discussing in earnest the possibility of creating a unified Korean martial art. Until then, \"Tang Soo Do\" was the term used for Korean karate, using the Korean hanja pronunciation of the Japanese kanji . The name \"Tae Soo Do\" () was also used to describe a unified style Korean martial arts. This name consists of the hanja \"to stomp, trample\", \"hand\" and \"way, discipline\".\nChoi Hong-hi advocated the use of the name \"Tae Kwon Do\", replacing \"su\" \"hand\" with (Revised Romanization: ; McCune\u2013Reischauer: ) \"fist\", the term also used for \"martial arts\" in Chinese (pinyin ). The name was also the closest to the pronunciation of \"taekkyon\", The new name was initially slow to catch on among the leaders of the \"kwans\". During this time taekwondo was also adopted for use by the South Korean military, which increased its popularity among civilian martial arts schools.\nDevelopment of multiple styles.\nIn 1959, the Korea Tang Soo Do Association (later Korea Taekwondo Association or KTA) was established to facilitate the unification of Korean martial arts. Choi wanted all the other member \"kwans\" of the KTA to adopt his own Chan Hon-style of taekwondo, as a unified style. This was, however, met with resistance as the other \"kwans\" instead wanted a unified style to be created based on inputs from all the \"kwans\", to serve as a way to bring on the heritage and characteristics of all of the styles, not just the style of a single \"kwan\". As a response to this, along with political disagreements about teaching taekwondo in North Korea and unifying the whole Korean Peninsula, Choi broke with the (South Korea) KTA in 1966, in order to establish the International Taekwon-Do Federation (ITF)\u2014 a separate governing body devoted to institutionalizing his Chan Hon-style of taekwondo in Canada.\nInitially, the South Korean president gave Choi's ITF limited support, due to their personal relationship. However, Choi and the government later split on the issue of whether to accept North Korean influence on the martial art. In 1972, South Korea withdrew its support for the ITF. The ITF continued to function as an independent federation, then headquartered in Toronto, Canada. Choi continued to develop the ITF-style, notably with the 1983 publication of his \"Encyclopedia of Taekwon-Do\". After his retirement, the ITF split in 2001 and then again in 2002 to create three separate ITF federations, each of which continues to operate today under the same name.\nIn 1972, the KTA and the South Korean government's Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism established the Kukkiwon as the new national academy for taekwondo. Kukkiwon now serves many of the functions previously served by the KTA, in terms of defining a government-sponsored unified style of taekwondo. In 1973 the KTA and Kukkiwon supported the establishment of the World Taekwondo Federation (WTF), which later changed its name to \"World Taekwondo\" (WT) in 2017 due to the previous initialism overlapping with an internet slang term. While the Kukkiwon focus on the martial art and self-defence aspects of Kukki-Taekwondo, the WT promoted the sportive side, and its competitions employ a subset of the techniques present in the Kukkiwon-style taekwondo. For this reason, Kukkiwon-style Taekwondo is often referred to as WT-style Taekwondo, sport-style Taekwondo, or Olympic-style Taekwondo, though in reality the style is defined by the Kukkiwon, not the WT.\nSince 2000, taekwondo has been one of three Asian martial arts (the others being judo and karate), and one of six total (the others being the previously mentioned, Greco-Roman wrestling, freestyle wrestling, and boxing) included in the Olympic Games. It started as a demonstration event at the 1988 games in Seoul, a year after becoming a medal event at the Pan Am Games, and became an official medal event at the 2000 Summer Olympics. In 2010, taekwondo was accepted as a Commonwealth Games sport.\nFeatures.\nTaekwondo is characterized by its emphasis on head-height kicks, jumping and spinning kicks, and fast kicking techniques. In fact, WT sparring competitions award additional points for strikes that incorporate spinning kicks, kicks to the head, or both.\nTypical curriculum.\nWhile organisations such as ITF or Kukkiwon define the general style of taekwondo, individual clubs and schools tend to tailor their taekwondo practices. Although each taekwondo club or school is different, a student typically takes part in most or all of the following:\nThough weapons training is not a formal part of most taekwondo federation curriculum, individual schools will often incorporate additional training with weapons such as staffs, knives, and sticks.\nStyles and organizations.\nThere are a number of major taekwondo styles as well as a few niche styles. Most styles are associated with a governing body or federation that defines the style. The major technical differences among taekwondo styles and organizations generally revolve around:\n1946: Traditional Taekwondo.\n\"Traditional Taekwondo\" refers to the 1940s and 1950s martial arts by the nine original \"kwans\". They used a number of different names such as Tang Soo Do (Chinese Hand Way), Kong Soo Do (Empty Hand Way) and Tae Soo Do (Foot Hand Way). Traditional Taekwondo is still practised today but generally under names like Tang Soo Do and Soo Bahk Do. In 1959, the name \"taekwondo\" was agreed upon by the nine original \"kwans\" as a common term for their martial arts. As part of the unification process, The Korea Taekwondo Association (KTA) was formed through a collaborative effort by representatives from all the \"kwans\", and the work began on a common curriculum, which eventually resulted in the Kukkiwon and the Kukki Style of Taekwondo. The original \"kwans\" that formed KTA continues to exist today, but as independent fraternal membership organizations that support the World Taekwondo and Kukkiwon. The \"kwans\" also function as a channel for the issuing of Kukkiwon dan and poom certification (black belt ranks) for their members. The official curriculum of those \"kwans\" that joined the unification is that of the Kukkiwon, with the notable exception of half the Oh Do Kwan which joined the ITF instead and therefore uses the Chan Hon curriculum.\n1966: ITF/Chang Hon-style Taekwondo.\nInternational Taekwon-Do Federation (ITF)-style Taekwondo, more accurately known as Chang Hon-style Taekwondo, is defined by Choi Hong-hi's \"Encyclopedia of Taekwon-Do\" published in 1983.\nIn 1990, the Global Taekwondo Federation (GTF) split from the ITF due to the political controversies surrounding the ITF; the GTF continues to practice ITF-style Taekwondo, however, with additional elements incorporated into the style. Likewise, the ITF itself split in 2001 and again in 2002 into three separate federations, headquartered in Austria, the United Kingdom, and Spain respectively.\nThe GTF and all three ITFs practice Choi's ITF-style Taekwondo. In ITF-style Taekwondo, the word used for \"forms\" is \"tul\"; the specific set of tul used by the ITF is called \"Chang Hon\". Choi defined 24 \"Chang Hon\" tul. The names and symbolism of the Chang Hon tul refer to elements of Korean history, culture and religious philosophy. The GTF-variant of ITF practices an additional six tul.\nWithin the ITF taekwondo tradition there are two sub-styles:\nSome ITF schools adopt the sine wave style, while others do not. Essentially all ITF schools do, however, use the patterns (tul) defined in the Encyclopedia, with some exceptions related to the forms \"Juche\" and \"Ko-Dang\".\n1969: ATA/Songahm-style Taekwondo.\nIn 1969, Haeng Ung Lee, a former Taekwondo instructor in the South Korean military, relocated to Omaha, Nebraska and established a chain of martial arts schools in the United States under the banner of the American Taekwondo Association (ATA). Like Jhoon Rhee Taekwondo, ATA Taekwondo has its roots in traditional taekwondo. The style of Taekwondo practised by the ATA is called \"Songahm Taekwondo\". The ATA went on to become one of the largest chains of Taekwondo schools in the United States.\nThe ATA established international spin-offs called the Songahm Taekwondo Federation (STF) and the World Traditional Taekwondo Union (WTTU) to promote the practice of Songahm Taekwondo internationally. In 2015, all the spin-offs were reunited under the umbrella of ATA International.\n1970s: Jhoon Rhee-style Taekwondo.\nIn 1962 Jhoon Rhee, upon graduating from college in Texas, relocated to and established a chain of martial arts schools in the Washington, D.C. area that practiced Traditional Taekwondo. In the 1970s, at the urging of Choi Hong-hi, Rhee adopted ITF-style Taekwondo within his chain of schools, but like the GTF later departed from the ITF due to the political controversies surrounding Choi and the ITF. Rhee went on to develop his own style of taekwondo called Jhoon Rhee-style Taekwondo, incorporating elements of both traditional and ITF-style Taekwondo as well as original elements.\n1972: Kukki-style / WT-Taekwondo.\nIn 1972 the Korea Taekwondo Association (KTA) Central Dojang opened in Seoul; in 1973 the name was changed to Kukkiwon. Under the sponsorship of the South Korean government's Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism the Kukkiwon became the new national academy for Taekwondo, thereby establishing a new \"unified\" style of Taekwondo. In 1973 the KTA established the World Taekwondo Federation (WTF, now called World Taekwondo, WT) to promote the sportive side of Kukki-Taekwondo. The International Olympic Committee recognized the WT and Taekwondo sparring in 1980. For this reason, the Kukkiwon-defined style of Taekwondo is sometimes referred to as \"Sport-style Taekwondo\", \"Olympic-style Taekwondo\", or \"WT-style Taekwondo\", but the style itself is defined by the Kukkiwon, not by the WT, and the WT competition ruleset itself only allows the use of a very small number of the total number of techniques included in the style.\nExtreme Taekwondo.\nExtreme Taekwondo is a hybrid style created in 2008, by Taekwondo practitioner Shin-Min Cheol, who also founded Mirme Korea in 2012, a production company that helped spread his style. His company is based on promoting TKD tournaments, in a style which mixed other martial arts like Karate and Capoeira.\nHup Kwon Do.\nHup Kwon Do is a hybrid style of Taekwondo created by a Malayan martial artist called Grandmaster Lee in 1989. He opened his first school in Penang, and originally developed this system as a self-defense technique, mixing Taekwondo with a multitude of other martial arts, such as Kendo, Bokken, Wado Shimpo, Kickboxing and Karate. It is mainly governed by the World Hupkwondo Council (WHC).\nHan Moo Do.\nHan Moo Doo is a hybrid martial art created by Korean practitioner Yoon Sung Hwang in 1989, in Kauhava, Finland.\nLike other variations of Taekwondo, it first started out as a method of self-defense before spreading across Northern countries such as Sweden, Norway and Denmark. It combines Taekwondo with other Korean martial arts like Hapkido and Hoi Jeon Moo Sool.\nIt mixes striking and grappling techniques, and some schools also incorporate weapons training into it.\nHan Mu Do.\nHan Mu Do is a martial art developed by Korean practitioner Dr. Young Kimm, who founded the World Hanmudo Association to assure the preservation of his style.\nIts ideals are mostly based on the Han philosophy, mainly about the mind balance of the practitioner.\nYoung Kimm studied Taekwondo, Tang Soo Do, Kuk Sul, Hapkido, Korean Judo and Kum Do, mixing all of their techniques together to create his own style.\nTeuk Gong Moo Sool.\nTeukgong Moosool is a combat system developed in South Korea by the special forces units that is projected to stop the opponent as quickly as possible, although it was also used in sports competition.\nIt is a hybrid style that mixes Taekwondo, Judo, Hapkido, Sanda (and other Chinese wushu styles) and Korean Kickboxing and it follows the Yin-Yang and five elements philosophy.\nIts origins date back to the 1960s\u201370s, but it was only introduced in special forces training in 1979.\nHoshin Moosool.\nHoshin Moosool is a martial art and combat system founded by Taekwondo Grandmaster Lee Kwan-Young. Its techniques and method are inspired from Master Lee's experience as a close combat instructor during the Vietnam war, instructor for the French Police Elite Unit (RAID) and time as a member of the Korean and French intelligence service.\nEquipment and facilities.\nA Taekwondo practitioner typically wears a (; ) uniform with a belt tied around the waist.\nWhen sparring, padded equipment is usually worn. In the ITF tradition, typically only the hands and feet are padded. In the Kukkiwon/WT tradition, full-contact sparring is facilitated by the employment of more extensive equipment: padded helmets called are always worn, as are padded torso protectors called ; feet, shins, groins, hands, and forearms protectors are also worn.\nThe school or place where instruction is given is called a (; ).\nRanks, belts, and promotion.\nTaekwondo ranks vary from style to style and are not standardized. For junior ranks, ranks are indicated by a number and the term (; ; , \"gup\", or \"kup\"), which represents belt color. A belt color may have a stripe in it. Ranks typically count down from higher numbers to lower ones. For senior ranks (\"black belt\" ranks), each rank is called a or \"degree\" and counts upwards.\nStudents must pass tests to advance ranks, and promotions happen at a progressive rate depending on the school.\nTitles can also come with ranks. For example, in the International Taekwon-Do Federation, instructors holding 1st to 3rd are called (; ; \"assistant instructor\"), those holding 4th to 6th \"dan\" are called (; ; \"instructor\"), those holding 7th to 8th \"dan\" are called (; ; \"master\"), and those holding 9th \"dan\" are called (; ; \"grandmaster\").\nIn WT/Kukki-Taekwondo, instructors holding 1st. to 3rd. \"dan\" are considered assistant instructors (), are not yet allowed to issue ranks, and are generally thought of as still having much to learn. Instructors who hold a 4th. to 6th. \"dan\" are considered master instructors (), and are allowed to grade students to ranks beneath their own. Those who hold a 7th\u20139th \"dan\" are considered Grandmasters. Kukkiwon-issued ranks also hold an age requirement, with grandmaster ranks requiring an age of over forty.\nForms (patterns).\nThree Korean terms may be used with reference to taekwondo forms or patterns. These forms are equivalent to \"kata\" in karate.\nA hyeong is a systematic, prearranged sequence of martial techniques that is performed either with or without the use of a weapon.\nDifferent taekwondo styles and associations (ATA, ITF, GTF, WT, etc.) use different taekwondo forms.\nPhilosophy.\nDifferent styles of Taekwondo adopt different philosophical underpinnings. Many of these underpinnings however refer back to the Five Commandments of the Hwarang as a historical referent. For example, Choi Hong-hi expressed his philosophical basis for taekwondo as the Five Tenets of Taekwondo:\nThese tenets are further articulated in a taekwondo oath, also authored by Choi:\nModern ITF organizations have continued to update and expand upon this philosophy.\nThe World Taekwondo Federation (WTF) also refers to the commandments of the Hwarang in the articulation of its taekwondo philosophy. Like the ITF philosophy, it centers on the development of a peaceful society as one of the overarching goals for the practice of taekwondo. The WT's stated philosophy is that this goal can be furthered by adoption of the Hwarang spirit, by behaving rationally (\"education in accordance with the reason of heaven\"), and by recognition of the philosophies embodied in the (the yin and the yang, i.e., \"the unity of opposites\") and the sam taegeuk (understanding change in the world as the interactions of the heavens, the Earth, and Man). The philosophical position articulated by the Kukkiwon is likewise based on the Hwarang tradition.\nTheory of power.\nThe emphasis on speed and agility is a defining characteristic of taekwondo and has its origins in analyses undertaken by Choi Hong-hi. The results of that analysis are known by ITF practitioners as Choi's \"Theory of Power\". Choi based his understanding of power on biomechanics and Newtonian physics as well as Chinese martial arts. For example, Choi observed that the kinetic energy of a strike increases quadratically with the speed of the strike, but increases only linearly with the mass of the striking object. In other words, speed is more important than size in terms of generating power. This principle was incorporated into the early design of taekwondo and is still used.\nChoi also advocated a \"relax/strike\" principle for taekwondo; in other words, between blocks, kicks, and strikes the practitioner should relax the body, then tense the muscles only while performing the technique. It is believed that the relax/strike principle increases the power of the technique, by conserving the body's energy. He expanded on this principle with his advocacy of the \"sine wave\" technique. This involves raising one's centre of gravity between techniques, then lowering it as the technique is performed, producing the up-and-down movement from which the term \"sine wave\" is derived.\nThe components of the Theory of Power include:\nCompetitions.\nTaekwondo competitions typically involve sparring, breaking, and patterns; some tournaments also include special events such as demonstration teams and self-defense (\"hosinsul\"). In Olympic taekwondo competitions, however, only sparring (using WT competition rules) is performed.\nThere are two kinds of competition sparring: point sparring, in which all strikes are light contact and the clock is stopped when a point is scored; and Olympic sparring, where all strikes are full contact and the clock continues when points are scored.\nWorld Taekwondo.\nUnder World Taekwondo (WT, formerly WTF) and Olympic rules, sparring is a full-contact event, employing a continuous scoring system where the fighters are allowed to continue after scoring each technique, taking place between two competitors in either an area measuring 8\u00a0meters square or an octagon of similar size. Competitors are matched within gender and weight division\u2014eight divisions for World Championships that are condensed to four for the Olympics. A win can occur by points, or if one competitor is unable to continue (knockout). However, there are several decisions that can lead to a win, as well, including superiority, withdrawal, disqualification, or even a referee's punitive declaration. Each match consists of three two-minute rounds, with one minute rest between rounds, though these are often abbreviated or shortened for some junior and regional tournaments. Competitors must wear a \"hogu\", head protector, shin pads, foot socks, forearm guards, hand gloves, a mouthpiece, and a groin cup. Tournaments sanctioned by national governing bodies or the WT, including the Olympics and World Championship, use electronic \"hogus\", electronic foot socks, and electronic head protectors to register and determine scoring techniques, with human judges used to assess and score technical (spinning) techniques and score punches.\nPoints are awarded for permitted techniques delivered to the legal scoring areas as determined by an electronic scoring system, which assesses the strength and location of the contact. The only techniques allowed are kicks (delivering a strike using an area of the foot below the ankle), punches (delivering a strike using the closed fist), and pushes. In some smaller tournaments, and in the past, points were awarded by three corner judges using electronic scoring tallies. All major national and international tournaments have moved fully (as of 2017) to electronic scoring, including the use of electronic headgear. This limits corner judges to scoring only technical points and punches. Some believe that the new electronic scoring system reduces controversy concerning judging decisions, but this technology is still not universally accepted. In particular, the move to electronic headgear has replaced controversy over judging with controversy over how the technology has changed the sport. Because the headgear is not able to determine if a kick was a correct taekwondo technique, and the pressure threshold for sensor activation for headgear is kept low for safety reasons, athletes who improvised ways of placing their foot on their opponents head were able to score points, regardless of how true to taekwondo those techniques were.\nTechniques are divided into three categories: scoring techniques (such as a kick to the \"hogu\"), permitted but non-scoring techniques (such as a kick that strikes an arm), and not-permitted techniques (such as a kick below the waist).\nThe referee can give penalties at any time for rule-breaking, such as hitting an area not recognized as a target, usually the legs or neck. Penalties, called \"Gam-jeom\" are counted as an addition of one point for the opposing contestant. Following 10 \"Gam-jeom\" a player is declared the loser by referee's punitive declaration\nAt the end of three rounds, the competitor with most points wins the match. In the event of a tie, a fourth \"sudden death\" overtime round, sometimes called a \"Golden Point\", is held to determine the winner after a one-minute rest period. In this round, the first competitor to score a point wins the match. If there is no score in the additional round, the winner is decided by superiority, as determined by the refereeing officials or number of fouls committed during that round. If a competitor has a 20-point lead at the end of the second round or achieves a 20-point lead at any point in the third round, then the match is over and that competitor is declared the winner.\nIn addition to sparring competition, World Taekwondo sanctions competition in \"poomsae\" or forms, although this is not an Olympic event. Single competitors perform a designated pattern of movements, and are assessed by judges for accuracy (accuracy of movements, balance, precision of details) and presentation (speed and power, rhythm, energy), both of which receive numerical scores, with deductions made for errors. Pair and team competition is also recognized, where two or more competitors perform the same form at the same time. In addition to competition with the traditional forms, there is experimentation with freestyle forms that allow more creativity.\nInternational Taekwon-Do Federation.\nThe International Taekwon-Do Federation (ITF) has sparring rules similar to the WT's, but they differ in some ways:\nCompetitors do not wear the \"hogu\" (although they are required to wear approved foot and hand protection equipment, as well as optional head guards). This scoring system varies between individual organisations within the ITF; for example, in the TAGB, punches to the head or body score 1 point, kicks to the body score 2 points, and kicks to the head score 3 points.\nA continuous point system is utilized in ITF competition, where the fighters are allowed to continue after scoring a technique. Excessive contact is generally not allowed according to the official ruleset, and judges penalize any competitor with disqualification if they injure their opponent and he can no longer continue (although these rules vary between ITF organizations). At the end of two minutes (or some other specified time), the competitor with more scoring techniques wins.\nFouls in ITF sparring include: attacking a fallen opponent, leg sweeping, holding/grabbing, or intentional attack to a target other than the opponent.\nITF competitions also feature performances of patterns, breaking, and 'special techniques' (where competitors perform prescribed board breaks at great heights).\nMulti-discipline competition.\nSome organizations deliver multi-discipline competitions, for example the British Student Taekwondo Federation's inter-university competitions, which have included separate WT rules sparring, ITF rules sparring, Kukkiwon patterns and Chang-Hon patterns events run in parallel since 1992.\nOther organizations.\nAmerican Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) competitions are very similar, except that different styles of pads and gear are allowed.\nList of competitions.\nWorld Taekwondo competitions.\nWorld Taekwondo (WT) directly sanctions the following competitions:\nOther tournaments.\nThese feature WT Taekwondo only:\nTaekwondo is also an optional sport at the Commonwealth Games.\nWeight divisions.\nThe following weight divisions are in effect due to the WT and ITF tournament rules and regulations:\nTaekwondo Korean terms.\nIn taekwondo schools\u2014even outside Korea\u2014Korean language commands and vocabulary are often used.

This had become necessary near the end of the first century BCE, as the common language was Aramaic, while Hebrew was used for little more than schooling and worship. The translator frequently expanded his translation with paraphrases, explanations and examples, so it became a kind of sermon.\nWriting down the targum was initially prohibited; nevertheless, some targumitic writings appeared as early as the middle of the first century. They were not recognized as authoritative by the religious leaders. Some subsequent Jewish traditions, beginning with the Jews of Lower Mesopotamia, accepted the written targumim as authoritative translations of the Hebrew scriptures into Aramaic. Today, the common meaning of \"targum\" is a written Aramaic translation of the Bible. Only Yemenite Jews continue to use the targumim liturgically.\nAs translations, the targumim largely reflect midrashic interpretation of the Tanakh from the time they were written and are notable for favoring allegorical readings over anthropomorphisms. Maimonides, for one, notes this often in \"The Guide for the Perplexed\". That is true both for those targums that are fairly literal as well as for those that contain many midrashic expansions. In 1541, Elia Levita wrote and published the \"Sefer Meturgeman,\" explaining all the Aramaic words found in the Targums Onqelos, Jonathan, and pseudo-Jonathan.\nTargumim are used today as sources in text-critical editions of the Bible (\"Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia\" refers to them with the abbreviation \ud835\udd17).\nEtymology.\nThe noun \"Targum\" is derived from the early semitic quadriliteral root \u05ea\u05e8\u05d2\u05dd (), and the Akkadian term \"targummanu\" refers to \"translator, interpreter\". It occurs in Ezra 4:7 \"a letter written in Aramaic and translated.\" Besides denoting the translations of the Bible, \"targum\" also denoted the oral rendering of Bible lections in synagogue, while the translator of the Bible was simply called \"hammeturgem\" (he who translates). Other than the meaning \"translate\", the verb \"tirgem\" also means \"to explain\". Targum refers to \"translation\" and argumentation or \"explanation\".\nTwo major targumim.\nThe two most important targumim for liturgical purposes are:\nThese two targumim are mentioned in the Babylonian Talmud as \"targum dilan\" (\"our Targum\"), giving them official status. In the synagogues of Talmudic times, Targum Onkelos was read alternately with the Torah, verse by verse, and Targum Jonathan was read alternately with the selection from Nevi'im (i.e., the haftara), though in the case of Nevi'im it was permitted to translate in units of up to three verses. This custom continues today in Yemenite Jewish synagogues.\nBesides its public function in the synagogue, the Babylonian Talmud also mentions targum in the context of a personal study requirement: \"A person should always review his portions of scripture along with the community, reading the scripture twice and the targum once\" (Berakhot 8a\u2013b). This, too, refers to Targum Onkelos on the public Torah reading and to Targum Jonathan on the haftarot from Nevi'im.\nMedieval biblical manuscripts of the Masoretic Text sometimes contain the Hebrew text interpolated, verse-by-verse, with the \"targumim\". This scribal practice is rooted in the public reading of the Targum and the requirement for private study. In these manuscripts, and in rabbinic Bibles up to and including the second printed Venice edition, Targumim were written or printed with cantillation marks.\nThe two \"official\" targumim are considered eastern (Mesopotamian, called \"Babylonian\"). Nevertheless, scholars believe they, too, originated in Syria Palestina because of a strong linguistic substratum of Jewish Palestinian Aramaic. Though these targumim were later \"orientalised\", the substratum belying their origins remains.\nWhen most Jewish communities ceased speaking Aramaic in the 10th century, the public reading of Targum, along with the Torah and Haftarah, was abandoned in most communities, Yemen being a well-known exception.\nThe private study requirement to review the Targum was never entirely relaxed, even when Jewish communities had largely ceased speaking Aramaic, and the Targum never ceased to be a major source for Jewish exegesis. For instance, it serves as a major source in Shlomo Yitzhaki's Torah commentary, \"Rashi,\" and has always been the standard fare for Ashkenazi Jews onward.\nFor these reasons, Jewish editions of the Tanakh which include commentaries still almost always print the Targum alongside the text, in all Jewish communities. Nevertheless, later halakhic authorities argued that the requirement to privately review the \"targum\" might also be met by reading a translation in the current vernacular in place of the official Targum, or else by studying an important commentary containing midrashic interpretation (especially that of Rashi).\nTargum Ketuvim.\nThe Talmud explicitly states that no official \"targumim\" were composed besides these two on Torah and Nevi'im alone, and that there is no official \"targum\" to Ketuvim (\"The Writings\"). The Talmud stories state:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Targum of the Pentateuch was composed by Onkelos the proselyte from the mouths of R. Eleazar and R. Joshua. The Targum of the Prophets was composed by Jonathan ben Uzziel under the guidance of Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi, and the land of Israel [thereupon] quaked over an area of four hundred parasangs by four hundred parasangs, and a Bath Kol (heavenly voice) came forth and exclaimed, \"Who is this that has revealed My secrets to mankind?\" Jonathan b. Uzziel arose and said, \"It is I who have revealed Thy secrets to mankind. It is fully known to Thee that I have not done this for my own honour or for the honour of my father's house, but for Thy honour I have done it, that dissension may not increase in Israel.\" He further sought to reveal [by] a targum [the inner meaning] of Ketuvim, but a Bath Kol went forth and said, \"Enough!\" What was the reason? Because the date of the Messiah is foretold in it.\nNevertheless, most books of Ketuvim (with the exceptions of Daniel and Ezra-Nehemiah, which both contain Aramaic portions) have \"targumim\", whose origin is mostly Palestinian rather than Mesopotamian. But they were poorly preserved and less well known for lack of a fixed place in the liturgy. From Palestine, the tradition of targum to Ketuvim made its way to Italy, and from there to medieval Ashkenaz and Sepharad. The targumim of Psalms, Proverbs, and Job are generally treated as a unit, as are the targumim of the five scrolls (Esther has a longer \"Second Targum\" as well.) The targum of Chronicles is quite late, possibly medieval. It is traditionally attributed to \"Rav Yosef\" (meaning either Rav Yosef or Rav Yosef bar Hama). (The targum to Neviim is also sometimes referred to as the targum of Rav Yosef.)\nOther Targumim on the Torah.\nThere are also a variety of western \"targumim\" on the Torah, each of which was traditionally called \"Targum Yerushalmi\" (\"Jerusalem Targum\"), and written in Western Aramaic. An important one of these was mistakenly labeled \"Targum Jonathan\" in later printed versions (though all medieval authorities refer to it by its correct name). The error crept in because of an abbreviation: the printer interpreted the abbreviation \"TY\" (\u05ea\"\u05d9) to stand for \"Targum Yonathan\" (\u05ea\u05e8\u05d2\u05d5\u05dd \u05d9\u05d5\u05e0\u05ea\u05df) instead of the correct \"Targum Yerushalmi\" (\u05ea\u05e8\u05d2\u05d5\u05dd \u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05e9\u05dc\u05de\u05d9). Scholars refer to this \"targum\" as Targum Pseudo-Jonathan. To attribute this targum to Jonathan ben Uzziel flatly contradicts the Talmudic tradition (Megillah 3a), which quite clearly attributes the targum to Nevi'im alone to him, while stating that there is no official targum to the Ketuvim. In the same printed versions, a similar fragment targum is correctly labeled as \"Targum Yerushalmi\".\nThe Western Targumim on the Torah, or Palestinian Targumim as they are also called, consist of three manuscript groups: Targum Neofiti I, Fragment Targums, and Cairo Geniza Fragment Targums.\nOf these Targum Neofiti I is the largest. It consist of 450 folios covering all books of the Pentateuch, with only a few damaged verses. The history of the manuscript begins 1587 when the censor Andrea de Monte (d. 1587) bequeathed it to Ugo Boncompagni\u2014which presents an oddity, since Boncompagni, better known as Pope Gregory XIII, died in 1585. The transmission route may instead be by a certain \"Giovan Paolo Eustachio romano neophito.\" Before this de Monte had censored it by deleting most references to idolatry. In 1602 Boncompagni's estate gave it to the College of the Neophytes, a college for converts from Judaism and Islam, until 1886, when the Holy See bought it along with other manuscripts when the Collegium closed (which is the reason for the manuscripts name and its designation). It was then mistitled as a manuscript of Targum Onkelos until 1949, when Alejandro D\u00edez Macho noticed that it differed significantly from Targum Onkelos. It was translated and published during 1968\u201379, and has since been considered the most important of the Palestinian Targumim, as it is by far the most complete and, apparently, the earliest as well.\nThe Fragment Targums (formerly known as Targum Yerushalmi II) consist of fragments divided into ten manuscripts. Of these P, V and L were first published in 1899 by M Ginsburger, A, B, C, D, F and G in 1930 by P Kahle and E in 1955 by A D\u00edez Macho. These manuscripts are all too fragmented to confirm what their purpose was, but they seem to be either the remains of a single complete targum or short variant readings of another targum. As a group, they often share theological views with Targum Neofiti, which has led to the belief that they could be variant readings of that targum.\nThe Cairo Geniza Fragment Targums originate from the Ben Ezra Synagogue's genizah in Cairo. They share similarities with the Fragment Targums in that they consist of many fragmented manuscripts that have been collected in one targum-group. The manuscripts A and E are the oldest among the Palestinian Targum and have been dated to around the seventh century. Manuscripts C, E, H and Z contain only passages from Genesis, A from Exodus while MS B contain verses from both as well as from Deuteronomium.\nThe Samaritan community has their own Targum to their text of the Torah. Other Targumim were also discovered among the Dead Sea Scrolls.\nPeshitta.\nThe Peshitta is the traditional Bible of Syriac Christians, who speak several different dialects of Aramaic. The translation of the Peshitta is thought to be before the year 300.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTadmor, H., 1991. \"On the role of Aramaic in the Assyrian empire\", in M.

These teachings were primarily concerned with laws and customs (Halacha), though they also included non-legal traditions (Aggada), as well as supplementary material (Tosefta) which was appended later to traditions which warranted clarification or addition of legal material. The Halacha, Aggada, and Tosefta collectively served as the foundation of the Oral Torah and the primary focus of study for the sages during the first two centuries CE. The oral traditions were no doubt transmitted as different collections by different scholars, though the Babylonian Talmud refers to a fixed work known as Tosefta, which was an integral part of a scholar's education. Geonic sources attest to the existence of a single work named Tosefta which is identical to the Tosefta known today.\nOverview.\nIn many ways, the Tosefta acts as a supplement (\"Toseft\u0101\") to the Mishnah. Being nearly three times as long, it often complements the Mishna and expands upon it, and it served as the primary commentary on it for the Amoraim, creators of the Talmuds. The Mishnah () is the basic compilation of the Oral law of Judaism; according to the tradition, it was compiled in 189 CE. The Tosefta closely corresponds to the Mishnah, with the same divisions for \"sedarim\" (\"orders\") and \"masekhtot\" (\"tractates\"), though there are three tractates in the Mishnah with no corresponding tractates in the Tosefta, those of Tamid, Middot and Kinnim, all at the end of the order of 'Kodashim'. The tractate 'Avot' from the order of 'Nezikin' is also absent from the Tosefta, though 'Avot de-Rabbi Natan' may be considered as filling its place. The number of chapters in each tractate does not necessarily correspond to that of the Mishnah, and the number of Halachot in a given chapter of the Tosefta is at times double that of the correspoding chapter in the Mishnah. Though the order of Halachot in the Tosefta largely parallels that of the Mishnah, it digresses so often that the reason for the digressions has drawn scholarly attention. Many scholars have suggested that the order in the Tosefta follows an earlier version of the Mishna. However, this is most likely inaccurate, as a close literary analysis will show that both texts follow the same order, and the digressions of the Tosefta are premeditated and pedagogical by nature. The Tosefta is mainly written in Mishnaic Hebrew, with some Aramaic.\nAt times, the text of the Tosefta agrees nearly verbatim with the Mishnah, in others, there are significant differences. The Tosefta often attributes laws that are anonymous in the Mishnah to named Tannaim, or attributes otherwise acredited laws differently. At times it also contradicts the Mishnah in the ruling of Jewish law. \nThe Tosefta often augments the Mishnah with additional glosses and discussions. It offers additional aggadic and midrashic material, though this is only because it is a larger corpus than the Mishnah and the proportion of this material is identical to both. In some ways the Tosefta continues the Mishnah, as it preserves the opinions and teachings of the later generations of Tanaim, namely that of Rabbi Judah HaNasi and the following generation, which were largely not recorded in the Mishna.\nOrigins.\nThe question of dating the Tosefta is discussed extensively among scholars. The mention of sages from the generation after Rabbi Judah HaNasi implies that it would necessarily have been redacted after the Mishnah. However, this fact cannot be taken as an indication of the date of the individual traditions included in it, each of which requires its own discussion. Suggestions for dating individual traditions in the Tosefta may be presented through a comparative study of all parallel Tannaitic sources. Another question revolves around the relationship between the Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmuds, which often quote Tannaitic traditions, known as \"baraitot\" (external traditions). These traditions are often similar in content and form to parallel traditions in the Mishnah and Tosefta, and are sometimes identical to them. Baraitot are commonly mentioned within Talmudic discussions of Mishnaic passages, and collections of them are attributed to various Amoraic sages; thus, their study would impact conclusions regarding the Tosefta as well.\nAuthorship.\nThere is no explicit mention of the author of the Tosefta within the Tosefta itself. Various collections of Tannaitic traditions have been attributed to different sages, including Rabbi Hiyya, Rabbi Hoshaya, and Bar Kappara, all contemporaries of Rabbi Judah HaNasi, and it is possible that these collections played a role in the Tosefta's compilation. A notable tradition in the Talmud, attributed to Rabbi Yochanan, stated that Rabbi Nehemiah, a younger contemporary of Rabbi Akiva, was the author of the anonymous traditions in the Tosefta. According to another passage in the Talmud, the Tosefta was redacted by Hiyya bar Abba and one of his students, Hoshaiah II. The ambiguity in the Talmud ultimately led to disagreement between the Gaonim and Rishonim on the issue of authorship. The majority, including Rabbi Nissim Ben Yaakov, Rabbi Sherira ben Hanina, Maimonides, and Rashi, conclude that Rabbi Hiyya was the author; Menachem HaMeiri suggests Bar Kappara, and a letter from the Cairo Geniza mentions Rabbi Hoshaya as such. \nModern scholarship has proposed many theories as to the identity of the editor of the Tosefta and the manner of its editing. Based on the tradition attributed to Rabbi Yochanan above, some have proposed that Rabbi Nehemia was the editor of the Tosefta as well. Most modern scholars reject this opinion, however many still believe that Rabbi Nehemia held a role in the redaction of the Tosefta, as is hinted at by the numerous mentions of Rabbi Nehemia in the Tosefta versus comparatively rare mentions in the Mishna. A. Schwartz suggested that the Tosefta is a compilation of the traditions extracted from the Mishna of Rabbi Meir as well as earlier baraitot, and this was later supplemented by the traditions extracted by Rabbi Judah HaNasi. \nWhereas the Mishna was considered authoritative, the Tosefta was supplementary. The Talmud often utilizes the traditions found in the Tosefta to examine the text of the Mishnah. \nThe traditional view is that the Tosefta should be dated to a period concurrent with or shortly after the redaction of the Mishnah. This view presupposes that the Tosefta was produced to record variant material not included in the Mishnah.\nModern scholarship can be roughly divided into two camps. Some, such as , theorize that the Tosefta as we have it developed from a proto-Tosefta recension that formed much of the basis for later Amoraic debate in the Talmuds. Others, such as Hanokh Albeck, theorize that the Tosefta is a later compendium of several baraitot collections that were in use during the Amoraic period. According to Epstein's approach, the baraitot in both Talmuds are derived from the ancient Tosefta, with one branch consisting of the Tosefta and the almost identical Baraitot of the Yerushalmi, and another branch consisting of the baraitot of the Bavli. According to the approach presented by Albeck, the baraitot of the Talmuds and the Tosefta drew from a common source. \nMore recent scholarship, such as that of Yaakov Elman, concludes that since the Tosefta, as we know it, must be dated linguistically as an example of Middle Hebrew 1, it was most likely compiled in early Amoraic times from oral transmission of baraitot. Shamma Friedman has found that the Tosefta draws on relatively early Tannaitic source material and that parts of the Tosefta predate the Mishnah.\nAuthority.\nSherira ben Hanina (987 CE), in his epistle written to the heads of the Jewish community in Kairouan (now in Tunisia), discusses the authority of the Tosefta in relation to the Mishnah. There, he writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We do not follow the opinion of R. \u1e24iya, as expressed in a Baraita, if he disputes with Rebbe [Judah ha-Nasi]. For example, let us suppose that a certain \"halacha\" had originally been a matter of dispute between R. Meir and R. Yosi; but Rebbe [Judah ha-Nasi] decided to record in the Mishnah only R. Meir's opinion [anonymously]. Had R. \u1e24iya then come along, in the Tosefta, and stated that the \"halacha\" had been originally a matter of dispute \u2013 even though it has now been reported anonymously \u2013 we follow the Mishnah rather than take up the episode which places the rabbis at variance. Whenever R. Meir and R. Yosi disagree, the \"halacha\" follows R. Yosi. Nevertheless, since in the Mishnah, Rebbe [Judah ha-Nasi] mentioned only R. Meir's opinion, we follow R. Meir.\nSherira then brings down the reverse of this example: \"Or, let us suppose that Rebbe [Yehuda Ha-Nassi] in the Mishnah records a dispute between R. Meir and R. Yosi. However, R. \u1e24iya prefers R. Meir's argument and records it in a Baraita without mentioning R. Yosi's opposing view. In such a case, we do not accept [R. \u1e24iya's] decision.\"\nCharacter.\nAt times the commentary character of the Tosefta is explicit, as it will address the reasons for various statements of the Mishna in the form of questions and answers. In other instances the Tosefta will provide a commentary which is interwoven with the words of the Mishna, or attached to the end of a Mishnaic passage as an appendix. Occasionally the Tosefta will quote a Mishna from a different chapter or tractate in order to illuminate the Mishna under discussion. When the Mishna discusses a prohibition in any given topic, the Tosefta will often supplement it with what may be permitted, and conversely when a permitted action is discussed, the Tosefta may supplement it with the prohibitions related to it. In certain cases the Mishna will provide the Halachic decree regarding the result of a certain sequence of actions, and the Tosefta will give the decree regarding the result of an opposite sequence. The Tosefta may also provide opinions differing from those mentioned in the Mishna, as well as reasoning, background and scriptural proofs for Mishnaic decrees. Finally, the Tosefta may use the Mishna as a point of departure for topics almost entirely absent from the Mishna.\nThe main two layers in the Tosefta consist of the teachings of the students of Rabbi Akiva and those of the following generation, the latter being a layer largely not documented in the Mishna. Accordingly, certain topics discussed generally in the Mishna will be expanded and will receive a detailed elaboration, and previously undiscussed cases will be covered. \nManuscripts, editions commentaries, and translations.\nManuscripts.\nThree manuscripts exist of the Tosefta:\nThe \"Editio Princeps\" was printed in Venice in 1521 as an addendum to Isaac Alfasi's \"Halakhot\".\nAll four of these sources, together with many Cairo Geniza fragments, have been published online by Bar Ilan University in the form of a searchable database.\nEditions.\nTwo critical editions have been published. The first was that of Moses Samuel Zuckermandl in 1882, which relied heavily on the Erfurt manuscript of the Tosefta. Zuckermandl's work has been characterized as \"a great step forward\" for its time. This edition was reprinted in 1970 by Rabbi Saul Lieberman, with additional notes and corrections.\nIn 1955, Saul Lieberman first began publishing his monumental \"Tosefta ki-Feshutah\". Between 1955 and 1973, ten volumes of the new edition were published, representing the text and the commentaries on the entire orders of Zera'im, Mo'ed and Nashim. In 1988, three volumes were published posthumously on the order of Nezikin, including tractates Bava Kama, Bava Metzia, and Bava Batra. Lieberman's work has been called the \"pinnacle of modern Tosefta studies.\"\nCommentaries.\nMajor commentaries on the Tosefta include those by:\nTranslations.\nThe Tosefta has been translated into English by Jacob Neusner and his students in the commentary cited above and was also published separately as \"The Tosefta: translated from the Hebrew\" (6 vols, 1977\u201386).\nTranslations of the tosefta are in various stages of progress at www.sefaria.org. Other attempts such as by Eli Gurevich's English translation are also being made. .\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

Hamilton. The article's summary addresses the issue in terms of \"cooperation in organisms, whether bacteria or primates\".\nThe book details a theory on the emergence of cooperation between individuals, drawing from game theory and evolutionary biology. Since 2006, reprints of the book have included a foreword by Richard Dawkins and have been marketed as a revised edition.\nThe book provides an investigation into how cooperation can emerge and persist as explained by the application of game theory. The book provides a detailed explanation of the evolution of cooperation, beyond traditional game theory. Academic literature regarding forms of cooperation that are not easily explained in traditional game theory, especially when considering evolutionary biology, largely took its modern form as a result of Axelrod's and Hamilton's influential 1981 paper and the subsequent book.\nBackground: Axelrod's tournaments.\nAxelrod initially solicited strategies from other game theorists to compete in the first tournament. Each strategy was paired with each other strategy for 200 iterations of a Prisoner's Dilemma game and scored on the total points accumulated through the tournament. The winner was a very simple strategy submitted by Anatol Rapoport called \"tit for tat\" (TFT) that cooperates on the first move, and subsequently echoes (reciprocates) what the other player did on the previous move. The results of the first tournament were analyzed and published, and a second tournament was held to see if anyone could find a better strategy. TFT won again. Axelrod analyzed the results and made some interesting discoveries about the nature of cooperation, which he describes in his book.\nIn both actual tournaments and various replays, the best-performing strategies were nice: that is, they were never the first to defect. Many of the competitors went to great lengths to gain an advantage over the \"nice\" (and usually simpler) strategies, but to no avail: tricky strategies fighting for a few points generally could not do as well as nice strategies working together. TFT (and other \"nice\" strategies generally) \"won, not by doing better than the other player, but by eliciting cooperation [and] by promoting the mutual interest rather than by exploiting the other's weakness.\"\nBeing \"nice\" can be beneficial, but it can also lead to being suckered. To obtain the benefit \u2013 or avoid exploitation \u2013 it is necessary to be provocable and forgiving. When the other player defects, a nice strategy must immediately be provoked into retaliatory defection. The same goes for forgiveness: return to cooperation as soon as the other player does. Overdoing the punishment risks escalation, and can lead to an \"unending echo of alternating defections\" that depresses the scores of both players.\nMost of the games that game theory had heretofore investigated are \"zero-sum\" \u2013 that is, the total rewards are fixed, and a player does well only at the expense of other players. But real life is not zero-sum. Our best prospects are usually in cooperative efforts. In fact, TFT \"cannot\" score higher than its partner; at best it can only do \"as good as\". Yet it won the tournaments by consistently scoring a strong second-place with a variety of partners. Axelrod summarizes this as \"don't be envious\"; in other words, don't strive for a payoff \"greater\" than the other player's.\nIn any IPD game, there is a certain maximum score each player can get by always cooperating. But some strategies try to find ways of getting a little more with an occasional defection (exploitation). This can work against some strategies that are less provocable or more forgiving than TFT, but generally, they do poorly. \"A common problem with these rules is that they used complex methods of making inferences about the other player [strategy] \u2013 and these inferences were wrong.\" Against TFT one can do no better than to simply cooperate. Axelrod calls this \"clarity\". Or: \"don't be too clever\".\nThe success of any strategy depends on the nature of the particular strategies it encounters, which depends on the composition of the overall population. To better model the effects of reproductive success Axelrod also did an \"ecological\" tournament, where the prevalence of each type of strategy in each round was determined by that strategy's success in the previous round. The competition in each round becomes stronger as weaker performers are reduced and eliminated. The results were amazing: a handful of strategies \u2013 all \"nice\" \u2013 came to dominate the field. In a sea of non-nice strategies the \"nice\" strategies \u2013 provided they were also provocable \u2013 did well enough with each other to offset the occasional exploitation. As cooperation became general the non-provocable strategies were exploited and eventually eliminated, whereupon the exploitive (non-cooperating) strategies were out-performed by the cooperative strategies.\nIn summary, success in an evolutionary \"game\" correlated with the following characteristics:\nFoundation of reciprocal cooperation.\nThe lessons described above apply in environments that support cooperation, but whether cooperation is supported at all, depends crucially on the probability (called \u03c9 [omega]) that the players will meet again, also called the discount parameter or, figuratively, the shadow of the future. When \u03c9 is low \u2013 that is, the players have a negligible chance of meeting again \u2013 each interaction is effectively a single-shot Prisoner's Dilemma game, and one might as well defect in all cases (a strategy called \"ALL D\"), because even if one cooperates there is no way to keep the other player from exploiting that. But in the iterated PD the value of repeated cooperative interactions can become greater than the benefit/risk of single exploitation (which is all that a strategy like TFT will tolerate).\nCuriously, rationality and deliberate choice are not necessary, nor trust nor even consciousness, as long as there is a pattern that benefits both players (e.g., increases fitness), and some probability of future interaction. Often the initial mutual cooperation is not even intentional, but having \"discovered\" a beneficial pattern both parties respond to it by continuing the conditions that maintain it.\nThis implies two requirements for the players, aside from whatever strategy they may adopt. First, they must be able to recognize other players, to avoid exploitation by cheaters. Second, they must be able to track their previous history with any given player, in order to be responsive to that player's strategy.\nEven when the discount parameter \u03c9 is high enough to permit reciprocal cooperation there is still a question of whether and how cooperation might start. One of Axelrod's findings is that when the existing population never offers cooperation nor reciprocates it \u2013 the case of ALL D \u2013 then no nice strategy can get established by isolated individuals; cooperation is strictly a sucker bet. (The \"futility of isolated revolt\".) But another finding of great significance is that clusters of nice strategies can get established. Even a small group of individuals with nice strategies with infrequent interactions can yet do so well on those interactions to make up for the low level of exploitation from non-nice strategies.\nCooperation becomes more complicated, however, as soon as more realistic models are assumed \nthat for instance offer more than two choices of action, \nprovide the possibility of gradual cooperation, \nmake actions constrain future actions (path dependence),\nor in which \ninterpret the associate's actions are is non-trivial (e.g. recognizing the degree \nof cooperation shown)\nSubsequent work.\nIn 1984 Axelrod estimated that there were \"hundreds of articles on the Prisoner's Dilemma cited in \"Psychological Abstracts\"\", and estimated that citations to \"The Evolution of Cooperation\" alone were \"growing at the rate of over 300 per year\".\nTo fully review this literature is infeasible. What follows are therefore only a few selected highlights.\nAxelrod considers his subsequent book, \"The Complexity of Cooperation\",\nto be a sequel to \"The Evolution of Cooperation\". Other work on the evolution of cooperation has expanded to cover prosocial behavior generally,\nand in religion,\nother mechanisms for generating cooperation,\nthe IPD under different conditions and assumptions,\nand the use of other games such as the Public Goods and Ultimatum games to explore deep-seated notions of fairness and fair play.\nIt has also been used to challenge the rational and self-regarding \"economic man\" model of economics,\nand as a basis for replacing Darwinian sexual selection theory with a theory of social selection.\nNice strategies are better able to invade if they have social structures or other means of increasing their interactions. Axelrod discusses this in chapter 8; in a later paper he and Rick Riolo and Michael Cohen\nuse computer simulations to show cooperation rising among agents who have negligible chance of future encounters but can recognize similarity of an arbitrary characteristic (such as a green beard); whereas other studies have shown that the only Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma strategies that resist invasion in a well-mixed evolving population are generous strategies.\nWhen an IPD tournament introduces noise (errors or misunderstandings), TFT strategies can get trapped into a long string of retaliatory defections, thereby depressing their score. TFT also tolerates \"ALL C\" (always cooperate) strategies, which then give an opening to exploiters.\nIn 1992 Martin Nowak and Karl Sigmund demonstrated a strategy called Pavlov (or \"win\u2013stay, lose\u2013shift\") that does better in these circumstances.\nPavlov looks at its own prior move as well as the other player's move. If the payoff was R or P (see \"Prisoner's Dilemma\", above) it cooperates; if S or T it defects.\nIn a 2006 paper Nowak listed five mechanisms by which natural selection can lead to cooperation.\nIn addition to kin selection and direct reciprocity, he shows that:\nThe payoffs in the Prisoner's Dilemma game are fixed, but in real life defectors are often punished by cooperators. Where punishment is costly there is a second-order dilemma amongst cooperators between those who pay the cost of enforcement and those who do not.\nOther work has shown that while individuals given a choice between joining a group that punishes free-riders and one that does not initially prefer the sanction-free group, yet after several rounds they will join the sanctioning group, seeing that sanctions secure a better payoff.\nIn small populations or groups there is the possibility that indirect reciprocity (reputation) can interact with direct reciprocity (e.g. tit for tat) with neither strategy dominating the other. The interactions between these strategies can give rise to dynamic social networks which exhibit some of the properties observed in empirical networks If network structure and choices in the Prisoner's dilemma co-evolve, then cooperation can survive. In the resulting networks cooperators will be more centrally located than defectors who will tend to be in the periphery of the network.\nIn \"The Coevolution of Parochial Altruism and War\" by Jung-Kyoo Choi and Samuel Bowles. From their summary:\nAltruism\u2014benefiting fellow group members at a cost to oneself \u2014and parochialism\u2014hostility towards individuals not of one's own ethnic, racial, or other group\u2014are common human behaviors. The intersection of the two\u2014which we term \"parochial altruism\"\u2014is puzzling from an evolutionary perspective because altruistic or parochial behavior reduces one's payoffs by comparison to what one would gain from eschewing these behaviors. But parochial altruism could have evolved if parochialism promoted intergroup hostilities and the combination of altruism and parochialism contributed to success in these conflicts... [Neither] would have been viable singly, but by promoting group conflict they could have evolved jointly.\nConsideration of the mechanisms through which learning from the social environment occurs is pivotal in studies of evolution. In the context of this discussion, learning rules, specifically conformism and payoff-dependent imitation, are not arbitrarily predetermined but are biologically selected. Behavioral strategies, which include cooperation, defection, and cooperation coupled with punishment, are chosen in alignment with the agent's prevailing learning rule. Simulations of the model under conditions approximating those experienced by early hominids reveal that conformism can evolve even when individuals are solely faced with a cooperative dilemma, contrary to previous assertions. Moreover, the incorporation of conformists significantly amplifies the group size within which cooperation can be sustained. These model results demonstrate robustness, maintaining validity even under conditions of high migration rates and infrequent intergroup conflicts.\nNeither Choi &amp; Bowles nor Guzm\u00e1n, Rodriguez-Sicket and Rowthorn claim that humans have actually evolved in this way, but that computer simulations show how war could be promoted by the interaction of these behaviors. A crucial open research question, thus, is how realistic the assumptions are on which these simulation models are based.\nSoftware.\nSeveral software packages have been created to run prisoner's dilemma simulations and tournaments, some of which have available source code.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}

Friedman\nThe Machinery of Freedom is a nonfiction book by David D. Friedman that advocates an anarcho-capitalist society from a consequentialist perspective.\nThe book was published in 1973, with a second edition in 1989 and a third edition in 2014.\nOverview.\nThe book aims to show that law and its enforcement do not require a state, but can be sustained by non-coercive private enterprise and charity. It explores the consequences of libertarian thought, describes examples of stateless societies (such as the Icelandic Commonwealth) and offers the author's personal statement about why he became a libertarian. Topics addressed in the book include polycentric law and the provision of public goods such as military defense in a stateless society. Friedman argues that a stateless legal system would be beneficial for society as a whole, including the poor.\nWhile some books supporting similar libertarian and anarcho-capitalist views offer support in terms of morality or natural rights, Friedman (although he explicitly denies being a utilitarian) here argues largely in terms of the effects of his proposed policies.\nFriedman conjectures that anything done by government costs at least twice as much as a privately provided equivalent, which has been labeled as his eponymous law: \"It costs any government at least twice as much to do something as it costs anyone else.\" He offers examples as evidence such as a comparison of the cost of the United States Postal Service's costs for package delivery with the costs of private carriers and the cost of the Soviet government versus market based services in the West.\nReception.\nThe Institute of Public Affairs, a libertarian think tank located in Australia, included \"The Machinery of Freedom\" in a list of the \"Top 20 books you must read before you die\" in 2006.\n\"Liberty\" magazine named the book among \"The Top Ten Best Libertarian Books\", praising Friedman for tackling the problems related to private national defense systems and attempting to solve them.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "30387", "revid": "8629330", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30387", "title": "Tom Stoppard", "text": "Czech-English playwright (1937\u20132025)\nSir Tom Stoppard (; born , 3 July 1937 \u2013 29 November 2025) was a Czech and English playwright and screenwriter. He wrote for film, radio, stage, and television, finding prominence with plays. His work covered the themes of human rights, censorship, and political freedom, often delving into the deeper philosophical bases of society. Stoppard was a playwright of the National Theatre; one of the most internationally performed dramatists of his generation; and critically compared with William Shakespeare and George Bernard Shaw. He was knighted for his contribution to theatre by Queen Elizabeth II in 1997 and awarded the Order of Merit in 2000. \nBorn in Czechoslovakia, Stoppard left as a Jewish child refugee, fleeing imminent Nazi occupation. He settled with his family in England after the war, in 1946, having spent the previous three years (1943\u20131946) at a boarding school in Darjeeling in the Indian Himalayas. After being educated at schools in Nottingham and Yorkshire, Stoppard became a journalist, a drama critic and then, in 1960, a playwright.\nStoppard's most prominent plays include \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead\" (1966), \"Jumpers\" (1972), \"Travesties\" (1974), \"Night and Day\" (1978), \"The Real Thing\" (1982), \"Arcadia\" (1993), \"The Invention of Love\" (1997), \"The Coast of Utopia\" (2002), \"Rock 'n' Roll\" (2006) and \"Leopoldstadt\" (2020). He wrote the screenplays for \"Brazil\" (1985), \"Empire of the Sun\" (1987), \"The Russia House\" (1990), \"Billy Bathgate\" (1991), \"Shakespeare in Love\" (1998), \"Enigma\" (2001), and \"Anna Karenina\" (2012), as well as the BBC/HBO limited series \"Parade's End\" (2013). He directed the film \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead\" (1990), adapting his own 1966 play as its screenplay, with Gary Oldman and Tim Roth as the leads.\nStoppard received numerous awards and honours including an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for \"Shakespeare In Love\", three Laurence Olivier Awards, and five Tony Awards. In 2008, \"The Daily Telegraph\" ranked him number 11 in their list of the \"100 most powerful people in British culture\". It was announced in June 2019 that Stoppard had written a new play, \"Leopoldstadt\", set in the Jewish community of early 20th-century Vienna. The play premiered in January 2020 at Wyndham's Theatre. The play went on to win the Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Play and later the 2023 Tony Award for Best Play.\nEarly life and education.\nStoppard was born Tom\u00e1\u0161 Str\u00e4ussler in Zl\u00edn, Czechoslovakia (present day Czech Republic), a city dominated by the shoe manufacturing industry. He was the younger son of Martha Beckov\u00e1 and Eugen Str\u00e4ussler, a doctor employed by the Bata shoe company. His parents were non-observant Jews. Just before the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, the town's patron, Jan Anton\u00edn Ba\u0165a, transferred his Jewish employees, mostly physicians, to branches of his firm outside Europe. On 15 March 1939, the day the Nazis invaded Czechoslovakia, the Str\u00e4ussler family fled to Singapore, where Bata had a factory.\nBefore the Japanese occupation of Singapore, Stoppard, his brother, and their mother fled to British India. Stoppard's father volunteered to remain in Singapore, knowing that as a doctor he would be needed in its defence. When Stoppard was four years old, his father died. The writer long believed that his father had perished in Japanese captivity, as a prisoner of war. The book \"Tom Stoppard in Conversation\" describes this, but the author later revealed the subsequent discovery that his father had been reported drowned after the ship he was aboard was bombed by Japanese forces, as he tried to flee Singapore in 1942. In 1941, when Tom\u00e1\u0161 was five, he, his brother Petr, and their mother had been evacuated to Darjeeling, India. The boys attended Mount Hermon School, an American multi-racial school, where the brothers became Peter and Tom.\nIn 1945, his mother, Martha, married Kenneth Stoppard, a major in the British Army. Kenneth adopted her children and the family moved to Nottingham, England in 1946. In Nottingham, Stoppard was \"warmly welcomed\" by his stepfather's family and he later noted that by this point in his life \"English was my only language. Suddenly I was an English schoolboy.\" Stoppard once wrote that his upbringing in England led him to become \"an honorary Englishman\", and stated that \"I fairly often find I'm with people who forget I don't quite belong in the world we're in. I find I put a foot wrong\u2014it could be pronunciation, an arcane bit of English history\u2014and suddenly I'm there naked, as someone with a pass, a press ticket.\" This is reflected in his characters, he observed, who are \"constantly being addressed by the wrong name, with jokes and false trails to do with the confusion of having two names.\" Stoppard attended the Dolphin School in Nottinghamshire, and later completed his education at Pocklington School in the East Riding of Yorkshire. Pocklington School built the Tom Stoppard Theatre in his name, which he opened in May 2001.\nStoppard left school at 17 and began work as a journalist for the \"Western Daily Press\" in Bristol, without attending university. Years later, he came to regret the decision to forgo a university education, but at the time, he loved his work as a journalist and was passionate about his career. He worked at the paper from 1954 until 1958, when the \"Bristol Evening World\" offered Stoppard the position of feature writer, humour columnist, and secondary drama critic, which took him into the world of theatre. At the Bristol Old Vic, at the time a well-regarded regional repertory company, Stoppard formed friendships with director John Boorman and actor Peter O'Toole early in their careers. In Bristol, he became known more for his strained attempts at humour and unstylish clothes than for his writing.\nCareer.\nEarly work.\nStoppard wrote short radio plays in 1953\u201354 and by 1960 he had completed his first stage play, \"A Walk on the Water\", which was later re-titled \"Enter a Free Man\" (1968).\nHe said the work owed much to Robert Bolt's \"Flowering Cherry\" and Arthur Miller's \"Death of a Salesman\". Within a week after sending \"A Walk on the Water\" to an agent, Stoppard received his version of the \"Hollywood-style telegrams that change struggling young artists' lives\" His first play was optioned, staged in Hamburg, then broadcast on British Independent Television in 1963. From September 1962 until April 1963, Stoppard worked in London as a drama critic for \"Scene\" magazine, writing reviews and interviews both under his name and the pseudonym William Boot (taken from Evelyn Waugh's \"Scoop\"). In 1964, a Ford Foundation grant enabled Stoppard to spend five months writing in a Berlin mansion, emerging with a one-act play titled \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Meet King Lear\", which later evolved into his Tony-winning play \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead\".\nIn the following years, Stoppard produced several works for radio, television and the theatre, including \"\"M\" is for Moon Among Other Things\" (1964), \"A Separate Peace\" (1966) and \"If You're Glad I'll Be Frank\" (1966). On 11 April 1967\u00a0\u2013 following acclaim at the 1966 Edinburgh Festival\u00a0\u2013 the opening of \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead\" in a National Theatre production at the Old Vic made Stoppard an overnight success. \"Jumpers\" (1972) places a professor of moral philosophy in a murder mystery thriller alongside a slew of radical gymnasts. \"Travesties\" (1974) explored the 'Wildean' possibilities arising from the fact that Vladimir Lenin, James Joyce, and Tristan Tzara had all been in Z\u00fcrich during the First World War. Stoppard wrote one novel, \"Lord Malquist and Mr Moon\" (1966). Its narrative follows the failing historian Moon, who takes the job of Boswell to the aristocrat Malquist. While not critically successful, the novel contains character tropes and themes that would later be used in Stoppard's plays.\n1980s.\nIn the 1980s, in addition to writing his own works, Stoppard translated many plays into English, including works by S\u0142awomir Mro\u017cek, Johann Nestroy, Arthur Schnitzler, and V\u00e1clav Havel. It was at this time that Stoppard became influenced by the works of Polish and Czech absurdists. He was co-opted into the Outrapo group, a far-from-serious French movement to improve actors' stage technique through science.\nIn 1982 Stoppard premiered his play \"The Real Thing\". The story revolves around a male-female relationship and the struggle between the actress and the member of a group fighting to free a Scottish soldier imprisoned for burning a memorial wreath during a protest. The leading roles were originated by Roger Rees, and Felicity Kendal. The story examines various constructs of honesty including a play within a play, to explore the theme of reality versus appearance. It has been described as one of Stoppard's \"most popular, enduring and autobiographical plays.\"\nThe play made its Broadway transfer in 1984, directed by Mike Nichols, starring Jeremy Irons and Glenn Close in the leading roles with a supporting role by Christine Baranski. The transfer was a critical success with \"The New York Times\" theatre critic Frank Rich declaring, \"The Broadway version of \"The Real Thing\"\u2014a substantial revision of the original London production\u2014is not only Mr. Stoppard's most moving play, but also the most bracing play that anyone has written about love and marriage in years.\" The production went on to earn seven Tony Award nominations, winning five awards for Best Play as well for Nichols, Irons, Close, and Baranski. This would be Stoppard's third Tony Award for Best Play, following \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead\" in 1968 and \"Travesties\" in 1976.\nIn 1985, Stoppard co-wrote with Terry Gilliam and Charles McKeown a feature film, the satirical science-fiction dark comedy \"Brazil\" (1985). \nThe film received near universal acclaim. Pauline Kael critic for \"The New Yorker\" declared, \"Visually, it\u2019s an original, bravura piece of moviemaking\u00a0... Gilliam\u2019s vision is an organic thing on the screen\u2014and that\u2019s a considerable achievement\". \nStoppard along with Gilliam and McKeown were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, losing to \"Witness\". He went on to write the scripts for Steven Spielberg's films \"Empire of the Sun\" (1987), based on the book by J. G. Ballard, and \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" (1989). Spielberg later stated that though Stoppard was uncredited for the latter of the two, \"he was responsible for almost every line of dialogue in the film\".\nFor his 1985 appearance on BBC Radio 4's \"Desert Island Discs\" Stoppard chose \"Careless Love\" by Bessie Smith as his favourite track; he also selected \"Inferno\" in two languages by Dante Alighieri as his chosen book and a plastic football as his luxury item.\n1990s.\nIn 1993, Stoppard wrote \"Arcadia\", a play in which he explores the interaction between two modern academics and the residents of a Derbyshire country house in the early 19th century, including aristocrats, tutors and the fleeting presence, unseen on stage, of Lord Byron. The themes of the play include the philosophical implications of the second law of thermodynamics, Romantic literature, and the English picturesque style of garden design.\n\"Arcadia\" was first performed at the Royal National Theatre in a production directed by Trevor Nunn and starring Rufus Sewell, Felicity Kendal, Bill Nighy, Harriet Walter and Emma Fielding. It won the 1993 Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Play. A year later the play made its transfer on Broadway starring Billy Crudup, Blair Brown, Victor Garber and Robert Sean Leonard. The production was well received with Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" writing, that while \"There are real difficulties with this production...[there are] also great pleasures, not the least of which are Mark Thompson's sets and costumes. Mostly, though, there are Mr. Stoppard's grandly eclectic obsessions and his singular gifts as a playwright. Attend to them.\" The production received three nominations at the 49th Tony Awards including Best Play, losing to Terrence McNally's \"Love! Valour! Compassion!\".\nStoppard gained acclaim with the feature film \"Shakespeare in Love\" (1998), which he wrote. The film, a romantic comedy, focuses on a fictional story involving William Shakespeare and his romance with a young woman who is an inspiration for the play \"Romeo and Juliet\". The film starred an ensemble cast including Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow, Geoffrey Rush, Colin Firth, and Judi Dench. The film was a critical and financial success and went on to earn seven Academy Awards including Best Picture. Stoppard received his second career Oscar nomination and first win for Best Original Screenplay. He also received the Golden Globe Award for his screenplay, which he wrote with Marc Norman.\n2000s.\n\"The Coast of Utopia\" (2002) was a trilogy of plays Stoppard wrote about the philosophical arguments among Russian revolutionary figures in the late 19th century. The trilogy comprises \"Voyage\", \"Shipwreck\", and \"Salvage\". Major figures in the play include Mikhail Bakunin, Ivan Turgenev, and Alexander Herzen. The title comes from a chapter in Avrahm Yarmolinsky's book \"\" (1959). The play premiered in 2002 at the National Theatre directed by Trevor Nunn; its total length spanned nine hours. The play received three Laurence Olivier Award nominations including Best New Play, ultimately losing in all its categories. In 2006 it made its Broadway premiere in a production starring Billy Crudup, Jennifer Ehle, and Ethan Hawke. The play received 10 nominations winning seven Tony awards including for Best Play, Stoppard's fourth win in the category.\n\"Rock 'n' Roll\" (2006) was set in both Cambridge, England, and Prague. The play explored the culture of 1960s rock music, especially the persona of Syd Barrett and the political challenge of the Czech band The Plastic People of the Universe, mirroring the contrast between liberal society in England and the repressive Czech state after the Warsaw Pact intervention in the Prague Spring.\nStoppard served on the advisory board of the magazine \"Standpoint\", and was instrumental in its foundation, giving the opening speech at its launch. He was also a patron of the Shakespeare Schools Festival, a charity that enables school children across the UK to perform Shakespeare in professional theatres. Stoppard was appointed president of the London Library in 2002 and vice-president in 2017 following the election of Sir Tim Rice as president.\n2010s.\nFor Joe Wright, Stoppard adapted Leo Tolstoy's \"Anna Karenina\" into the 2012 film adaptation starring Keira Knightley. Film critic Lisa Schwarzbaum for \"Entertainment Weekly\" praised the film, writing \"Stoppard\u2014himself a master of puzzle-like construction in fine plays including Arcadia\u2014supplies an excellently clean, delicately balanced script.\"\nIn 2012, Stoppard wrote a five-part limited series for television, \"Parade's End\", which revolves around a love triangle between a conservative English aristocrat, his mean socialite wife and a young suffragette. The series premiered on BBC Two, starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Rebecca Hall. The series received widespread acclaim from critics with \"The Independent\"'s Grace Dent proclaiming it \"one of the finest things the BBC has ever made\". \"IndieWire\" declared, \"\"Parade\u2019s End\" is wonderful accomplishment, smart, adult television\". Stoppard received a British Academy Television Award and Primetime Emmy Award nomination for the series.\nIt was announced in June 2019 that Stoppard had written a new play, set in the Jewish community of early 20th-century Vienna. \"Leopoldstadt\" premiered in January 2020 at Wyndham's Theatre and went on to win the Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Play. It then transferred to Broadway, opening on 2 October 2022. The play was nominated for six Tony Awards and won four, including Best Play.\nScreenwriting.\nStoppard also co-wrote screenplays including \"Shakespeare in Love\" (1998) and \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" (1989). Stoppard also worked on \"\", though again Stoppard received no official or formal credit in this role. He worked in a similar capacity with Tim Burton on his film \"Sleepy Hollow\". His radio production, \"Darkside\" (2013), was written for BBC Radio 2 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Pink Floyd's album \"The Dark Side of the Moon\".\nThemes.\nExistentialism.\n\"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead\" (1966\u201367) was Stoppard's first major play to gain recognition. The story of \"Hamlet\" as told from the viewpoint of two courtiers echoes Beckett in its double act repartee, existential themes and language play. \"Stoppardian\" became a term describing works using wit and comedy while addressing philosophical concepts. Critic Dennis Kennedy commented:It established several characteristics of Stoppard's dramaturgy: his word-playing intellectuality, audacious, paradoxical, and self-conscious theatricality, and preference for reworking pre-existing narratives... Stoppard's plays have been sometimes dismissed as pieces of clever showmanship, lacking in substance, social commitment, or emotional weight. His theatrical surfaces serve to conceal rather than reveal their author's views, and his fondness for towers of paradox spirals away from social comment. This is seen most clearly in his comedies \"The Real Inspector Hound\" (1968) and \"After Magritte\" (1970), which create their humour through highly formal devices of reframing and juxtaposition.Stoppard himself went so far as to declare \"I must stop compromising my plays with this whiff of social application. They must be entirely untouched by any suspicion of usefulness.\" He acknowledges that he started off \"as a language nerd\", primarily enjoying linguistic and ideological playfulness, feeling early in his career that journalism was far better suited for presaging political change, than playwriting.\nIntellectuality.\nThe accusations of favouring intellectuality over political commitment or commentary were met with a change of tack, as Stoppard produced increasingly socially engaged work. From 1977, he became personally involved with human-rights issues, in particular with the situation of political dissidents in Central and Eastern Europe. In February 1977, he visited the Soviet Union and several Eastern European countries with a member of Amnesty International. In June, Stoppard met Vladimir Bukovsky in London and travelled to Czechoslovakia (then under communist control), where he met dissident playwright and future president V\u00e1clav Havel, whose writing he greatly admired. Stoppard became involved with \"Index on Censorship\", Amnesty International, and the Committee Against Psychiatric Abuse and wrote various newspaper articles and letters about human rights. He was instrumental in translating Havel's works into English. \"Every Good Boy Deserves Favour\" (1977), \"a play for actors and orchestra\" was based on a request by conductor/composer Andr\u00e9 Previn and was inspired by a meeting with a Russian exile. This play, as well as \"Dogg's Hamlet, Cahoot's Macbeth\" (1979), \"The Coast of Utopia\" (2002), \"Rock 'n' Roll\" (2006), and two works for television \"Professional Foul\" (1977) and \"Squaring the Circle\" (1984), all concern themes of censorship, rights abuses, and state repression.\nStoppard's later works sought greater interpersonal depths, whilst maintaining their intellectual playfulness. Stoppard stated that around 1982 he moved away from the \"argumentative\" works and more towards plays of the heart, as he became \"less shy\" about emotional openness. Discussing the later integration of heart and mind in his work, he commented, \"I think I was too concerned when I set off, to have a firework go off every few seconds\u00a0... I think I was always looking for the entertainer in myself and I seem to be able to entertain through manipulating language\u00a0... [but] it's really about human beings, it's not really about language at all.\" \"The Real Thing\" (1982) uses a meta-theatrical structure to explore the suffering that adultery can produce and \"The Invention of Love\" (1997) also investigates the pain of passion. \"Arcadia\" (1993) explores the meeting of chaos theory, historiography, and landscape gardening. He was inspired by a Trevor Nunn production of Gorky's \"Summerfolk\" to write a trilogy of \"human\" plays: \"The Coast of Utopia\" (\"Voyage\", \"Shipwreck\", and \"Salvage\", 2002).\nStoppard commented that he loved the medium of theatre for how \"adjustable\" and independent from the text it was. His experience of writing for film was similar, offering the liberating opportunity to \"play God\", in control of creative reality. It often took four to five years from the first idea of a play to staging, as he made efforts to be as accurate in his research as possible.\nPersonal life.\nFamily and relationships.\nStoppard was married three times. His first marriage (1965\u20131972) was to Josie Ingle, a nurse. His second marriage (1972\u201392) was to Miriam Stern; they separated when he began a relationship with actress Felicity Kendal. He also had a relationship with actress Sin\u00e9ad Cusack, but she made it clear she wished to remain married to Jeremy Irons and stay close to their two sons. Also, after she was reunited with a son she had given up for adoption, she wished to spend time with him in Dublin rather than with Stoppard in the house they shared in France. He had two sons from each of his first two marriages: Oliver Stoppard, Barnaby Stoppard, the actor Ed Stoppard, and Will Stoppard, who is married to violinist Linzi Stoppard. In 2014 he married Sabrina Guinness.\nStoppard's mother died in 1996. The family had not talked about their history and neither brother knew what had happened to the family left behind in Czechoslovakia. In the early 1990s, with the fall of communism, Stoppard found out that all four of his grandparents had been Jewish and had died in Terezin, Auschwitz, and other camps, along with three of his mother's sisters.\nIn 1998, following the deaths of his parents, he returned to Zl\u00edn for the first time in over 50 years. He expressed grief both for a lost father and a missing past, but he had no sense of being a survivor, stating: \"I feel incredibly lucky not to have had to survive or die. It's a conspicuous part of what might be termed a charmed life.\"\nIn 2013, Stoppard asked Hermione Lee to write his biography. The book was published in 2020.\nPolitical views.\nIn 1979, the year of Margaret Thatcher's election, Stoppard noted to Paul Delaney: \"I'm a conservative with a small c. I am a conservative in politics, literature, education and theatre.\" In 2007, Stoppard described himself as a \"timid libertarian\".\nThe Tom Stoppard Prize () was created in 1983 under the Charter 77 Foundation and is awarded to authors of Czech origin.\nIn 2014, Stoppard publicly backed \"Hacked Off\" and its campaign towards press self-regulation by \"safeguarding the press from political interference while also giving vital protection to the vulnerable.\"\nDeath.\nOn 29 November 2025, Stoppard died at his home in Dorset, England, at the age of 88.\nLegacy and honours.\nStoppard was one of the most internationally performed dramatists of his generation and was critically compared with William Shakespeare and George Bernard Shaw.\nAwards.\nIn July 2013 Stoppard was awarded the PEN Pinter Prize for \"determination to tell things as they are\".\nIn July 2017, Stoppard was elected an Honorary Fellow of the British Academy (HonFBA), the United Kingdom's national academy for the humanities and social sciences. Stoppard was appointed Cameron Mackintosh Visiting Professor of Contemporary Theatre at St Catherine's College, Oxford, for the academic year 2017\u20132018.\nStoppard has been represented in various forms of art. He sat for sculptor Alan Thornhill, and a bronze head is now in public collection, situated with the Stoppard papers in the reading room of the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin. The terracotta remains in the collection of the artist in London. The correspondence file relating to the Stoppard bust is held in the archive of the Henry Moore Foundation's Henry Moore Institute in Leeds.\nStoppard also sat for the sculptor and friend Angela Conner, and his bronze portrait bust is on display in the grounds of Chatsworth House.\nArchive.\nThe papers of Stoppard are housed at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin. The archive was first established by Stoppard in 1991 and continues to grow. The collection consists of typescript and handwritten drafts, revision pages, outlines, and notes; production material, including cast lists, set drawings, schedules, and photographs; theatre programmes; posters; advertisements; clippings; page and galley proofs; dust jackets; correspondence; legal documents and financial papers, including passports, contracts, and royalty and account statements; itineraries; appointment books and diary sheets; photographs; sheet music; sound recordings; a scrapbook; artwork; minutes of meetings; and publications.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The thylacine died out in New Guinea and mainland Australia around 3,600\u20133,200 years ago, prior to the arrival of Europeans, possibly because of the introduction of the dingo, whose earliest record dates to around the same time, but which never reached Tasmania. Prior to European settlement, around 5,000 remained in the wild on the island of Tasmania. Beginning in the nineteenth century, they were perceived as a threat to the livestock of farmers and bounty hunting was introduced. The last known of its species died in 1936 at Hobart Zoo in Tasmania. The thylacine is widespread in popular culture and is a cultural icon in Australia.\nThe thylacine was known as the Tasmanian tiger because of the dark transverse stripes that radiated from the top of its back, and it was called the Tasmanian wolf because it resembled a medium- to large-sized canid. The name thylacine is derived from meaning 'pouch' and \"-ine\" meaning 'pertaining to', and refers to the marsupial pouch. Both sexes had a pouch. The females used theirs for rearing young, and the males used theirs as a protective sheath, covering the external reproductive organs. The animal had a stiff tail and could open its jaws to an unusual extent. Recent studies and anecdotal evidence on its predatory behaviour suggest that the thylacine was a solitary ambush predator specialised in hunting small- to medium-sized prey. Accounts suggest that, in the wild, it fed on small birds and mammals. It was the only member of the genus \"Thylacinus\" and family Thylacinidae to have survived until modern times. Its closest living relatives are the other members of Dasyuromorphia, including the Tasmanian devil, from which it is estimated to have split 42\u201336 million years ago.\nIntensive hunting on Tasmania is generally blamed for its extinction, but other contributing factors were disease, the introduction of and competition with dingoes, human encroachment into its habitat and climate change. The remains of the last known thylacine were discovered at the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery in 2022. Since extinction there have been numerous searches and reported sightings of live animals, none of which have been confirmed.\nThe thylacine has been used extensively as a symbol of Tasmania. The animal is featured on the official coat of arms of Tasmania. Since 1996, National Threatened Species Day has been commemorated in Australia on 7 September, the date on which the last known thylacine died in 1936. Universities, museums and other institutions across the world research the animal. Its whole genome sequence has been mapped, and there are efforts to clone and bring it back to life.\nTaxonomic and evolutionary history.\nNumerous examples of thylacine engravings and rock art have been found, dating back to at least 1000\u00a0BC. Petroglyph images of the thylacine can be found at the Dampier Rock Art Precinct, on the Burrup Peninsula in Western Australia.\nBy the time the first European explorers arrived, the animal was already extinct in mainland Australia and New Guinea and rare in Tasmania. Europeans may have encountered it in Tasmania as far back as 1642, when Abel Tasman first arrived in Tasmania. His shore party reported seeing the footprints of \"wild beasts having claws like a \"Tyger\"\". Marc-Joseph Marion du Fresne, arriving with the \"Mascarin\" in 1772, reported seeing a \"tiger cat\".\nThe first definitive encounter was by French explorers on 13 May 1792, as noted by the naturalist Jacques Labillardi\u00e8re, in his journal from the expedition led by d'Entrecasteaux. In 1805, William Paterson, the Lieutenant Governor of Tasmania, sent a detailed description for publication in the \"Sydney Gazette\". He also sent a description of the thylacine in a letter to Joseph Banks, dated 30 March 1805.\nThe first detailed scientific description was made by Tasmania's Deputy Surveyor-General, George Harris, in 1808, five years after first European settlement of the island. Harris originally placed the thylacine in the genus \"Didelphis\", which had been created by Linnaeus for the American opossums, describing it as \"Didelphis cynocephala\", the \"dog-headed opossum\". Recognition that the Australian marsupials were fundamentally different from the known mammal genera led to the establishment of the modern classification scheme, and in 1796, Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire created the genus \"Dasyurus\", where he placed the thylacine in 1810. To maintain gender agreement with the genus name, the species name was altered to \"cynocephalus\". In 1824, it was separated out into its own genus, \"Thylacinus\", by Temminck. The common name derives directly from the genus name, originally from the Greek (), meaning \"pouch\" or \"sack\" and \"ine\" meaning \"pertaining to\". The name is pronounced or .\nEvolution.\nThe earliest records of the modern thylacine are from the Early Pleistocene, with the oldest known fossil record in southeastern Australia from the Calabrian age around 1.77\u20130.78 million years ago. Specimens from the Pliocene-aged Chinchilla Fauna, described as \"Thylacinus rostralis\" by Charles De Vis in 1894, have in the past been suggested to represent \"Thylacinus cynocephalus\", but have been shown to either have been curatorial errors, or ambiguous in their specific attribution. The family Thylacinidae includes at least 12 species in eight genera. Thylacinids are estimated to have split from other members of Dasyuromorphia around 42\u201336 million years ago. The earliest representative of the family is \"Badjcinus turnbulli\" from the Late Oligocene of Riversleigh in Queensland, around 25 million years ago. Early thylacinids were quoll-sized, well under . It probably ate insects and small reptiles and mammals, although signs of an increasingly-carnivorous diet can be seen as early as the early Miocene in \"Wabulacinus\". Members of the genus \"Thylacinus\" are notable for a dramatic increase in both the expression of carnivorous dental traits and in size, with the largest species, \"Thylacinus potens\" and \"Thylacinus megiriani\", both approaching the size of a wolf. In late Pleistocene and early Holocene times, the modern thylacine was widespread (although never numerous) throughout Australia and New Guinea.\nA classic example of convergent evolution, the thylacine showed many similarities to the members of the dog family, Canidae, of the Northern Hemisphere: sharp teeth, powerful jaws, raised heels, and the same general body form. Since the thylacine filled the same ecological niche in Australia and New Guinea as canids did elsewhere, it developed many of the same features. Despite this, as a marsupial, it is unrelated to any of the Northern Hemisphere placental mammal predators.\nThylacinidae, including the thylacine, as the earliest divering lineage of Dasyuromorphia, which also includes numbats, dunnarts, and Dasyuridae (which includes wambengers, quolls, and the Tasmanian devil, among numerous others) The cladogram below follows the results of genetic studies:Phylogeny of Thylacinidae after Rovinsky et al. (2019)\nDescription.\nDescriptions of the thylacine come from preserved specimens, fossil records, skins and skeletal remains, and black and white photographs and film of the animal both in captivity and from the field. The thylacine resembled a large, short-haired dog with a stiff tail which smoothly extended from the body in a way similar to that of a kangaroo. The mature thylacine measured about in shoulder height and in body length, excluding the tail which measured around . Because the recorded body mass estimates are scant, it has been suggested that they may have weighed anywhere from , but a 2020 study that examined 93 adult specimens, with 40 of the specimens' sexes being known, argued that their average body mass would be with a range of based on volumetric analysis. There was slight sexual dimorphism, with the males being larger than females on average. Males weighed on average , and females on average weighed . The skull is noted to be highly convergent on those of canids, most closely resembling that of the red fox.\nThylacines, uniquely for marsupials, had largely cartilaginous epipubic bones with a highly reduced osseous element. This was once considered a synapomorphy with sparassodonts, though it is now thought that both groups reduced their epipubics independently. Its yellow-brown coat featured 15 to 20 distinctive dark stripes across its back, rump and the base of its tail, which earned the animal the nickname \"tiger\". The stripes were more pronounced in younger specimens, fading as the animal got older. One of the stripes extended down the outside of the rear thigh. Its body hair was dense and soft, up to in length. Colouration varied from light fawn to a dark brown; the belly was cream-coloured.\nIts rounded, erect ears were about long and covered with short fur. The early scientific studies suggested it possessed an acute sense of smell which enabled it to track prey, but analysis of its brain structure revealed that its olfactory bulbs were not well developed. It is likely to have relied on sight and sound when hunting instead. In 2017, Berns and Ashwell published comparative cortical maps of thylacine and Tasmanian devil brains, showing that the thylacine had a larger, more modularised basal ganglion. The authors associated these differences with the thylacine's more predatory lifestyle. Analysis of the forebrain published in 2023 suggested that it was similar in morphology to other dasyuromorph marsupials and dissimilar to that of canids.\nThe thylacine was able to open its jaws to an unusual extent: up to 80 degrees. This capability can be seen in part in David Fleay's short black-and-white film sequence of a captive thylacine from 1933. The jaws were muscular, and had 46 teeth, but studies show the thylacine jaw was too weak to kill sheep. The tail vertebrae were fused to a degree, with resulting restriction of full tail movement. Fusion may have occurred as the animal reached full maturity. The tail tapered towards the tip. In juveniles, the tip of the tail had a ridge. The female thylacine had a pouch with four teats, but unlike many other marsupials, the pouch opened to the rear of its body. Males had a scrotal pouch, unique amongst the Australian marsupials, into which they could withdraw their scrotal sac for protection.\nThylacine footprints could be distinguished from other native or introduced animals; unlike foxes, cats, dogs, wombats, or Tasmanian devils, thylacines had a very large rear pad and four obvious front pads, arranged in almost a straight line. The hindfeet were similar to the forefeet but had four digits rather than five. Their claws were non-retractable. The plantar pad is tri-lobal in that it exhibits three distinctive lobes. It is a single plantar pad divided by three deep grooves. The distinctive plantar pad shape along with the asymmetrical nature of the foot makes it quite different from animals such as dogs or foxes.\nThe thylacine was noted as having a stiff and somewhat awkward gait, making it unable to run at high speed. It could also perform a bipedal hop, in a fashion similar to a kangaroo\u2014demonstrated at various times by captive specimens. Guiler speculates that this was used as an accelerated form of motion when the animal became alarmed. The animal was also able to balance on its hind legs and stand upright for brief periods.\nObservers of the animal in the wild and in captivity noted that it would growl and hiss when agitated, often accompanied by a threat-yawn. During hunting, it would emit a series of rapidly repeated guttural cough-like barks (described as \"yip-yap\", \"cay-yip\" or \"hop-hop-hop\"), probably for communication between the family pack members. It also had a long whining cry, probably for identification at distance, and a low snuffling noise used for communication between family members. Some observers described it as having a strong and distinctive smell, others described a faint, clean, animal odour, and some no odour at all. It is possible that the thylacine, like its relative, the Tasmanian devil, gave off an odour when agitated.\nDistribution and habitat.\nThe thylacine most likely preferred the dry eucalyptus forests, wetlands, and grasslands of mainland Australia. Indigenous Australian rock paintings indicate that the thylacine lived throughout mainland Australia and New Guinea. Proof of the animal's existence in mainland Australia came from a desiccated carcass that was discovered in a cave in the Nullarbor Plain in Western Australia in 1990; carbon dating revealed it to be around 3,300 years old. Recently examined fossilised footprints also suggest historical distribution of the species on Kangaroo Island. The northernmost record of the species is from the Kiowa rock shelter in Chimbu Province in the highlands of Papua New Guinea, dating to the Early Holocene, around 10,000\u20138,500 years Before Present. In 2017, White, Mitchell and Austin published a large-scale analysis of thylacine mitochondrial genomes, showing that they had split into eastern and western populations on the mainland prior to the Last Glacial Maximum and that Tasmanian thylacines had a low genetic diversity by the time of European arrival.\nIn Tasmania, they preferred the woodlands of the midlands and coastal heath, which eventually became the primary focus of British settlers seeking grazing land for their livestock. The striped pattern may have provided camouflage in woodland conditions, but it may have also served for identification purposes. The species had a typical home range of between . It appears to have kept to its home range without being territorial; groups too large to be a family unit were sometimes observed together.\nEcology and behaviour.\nReproduction.\nThere is evidence for at least some year-round breeding (cull records show joeys discovered in the pouch at all times of the year), although the peak breeding season was in winter and spring. They would produce up to four joeys per litter (typically two or three), carrying the young in a pouch for up to three months and protecting them until they were at least half adult size. Early pouch young were hairless and blind, but they had their eyes open and were fully furred by the time they left the pouch. The young also had their own pouches that were not visible until they were 9.5 weeks old. After leaving the pouch, and until they were developed enough to assist, the juveniles would remain in the lair while their mother hunted. Thylacines only once bred successfully in captivity, in Melbourne Zoo in 1899. Their life expectancy in the wild is estimated to have been 5 to 7 years, although captive specimens survived up to 9 years.\nIn 2018, Newton et al. collected and CT-scanned all known preserved thylacine pouch young specimens to digitally reconstruct their development throughout their entire window of growth in their mother's pouch. This study revealed new information on the biology of the thylacine, including the growth of its limbs and when it developed its 'dog-like' appearance. It was found that two of the thylacine young in the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery (TMAG) were misidentified and of another species, reducing the number of known pouch young specimens to 11 worldwide. One of four specimens kept at Museum Victoria has been serially sectioned, allowing an in-depth investigation of its internal tissues and providing some insights into thylacine pouch young development, biology, immunology and ecology.\nFeeding and diet.\nThe thylacine was an apex predator, though exactly how large its prey animals could be is disputed. It was a nocturnal and crepuscular hunter, spending the daylight hours in small caves or hollow tree trunks in a nest of twigs, bark, or fern fronds. It tended to retreat to the hills and forest for shelter during the day and hunted in the open heath at night. Early observers noted that the animal was typically shy and secretive, with awareness of the presence of humans and generally avoiding contact, although it occasionally showed inquisitive traits. At the time, much stigma existed in regard to its \"fierce\" nature; this is likely to be due to its perceived threat to agriculture.\nHistorical accounts suggest that in the wild, the thylacine preyed on small mammals and birds, with waterbirds being the most commonly recorded bird prey, with historical accounts of thylacines predating on black ducks and teals with coots, Tasmanian nativehens, swamphens, herons (\"Ardea\") and black swans also being likely items of prey. The thylacine may also have preyed upon the now extinct Tasmanian emu. The most commonly recorded mammalian prey was the red-necked wallaby, with other recorded prey including the Tasmanian pademelon and the short-beaked echidna. Other probable native mammalian prey includes other marsupials like bandicoots and brushtail possums, as well as native rodents like water rats. Following their introduction to Tasmania, European rabbits rapidly multiplied and became abundant across the island, with a number of accounts reporting the predation of rabbits by thylacines. Some accounts also suggest that the thylacine may have preyed on lizards, frogs and fish.\nEuropean settlers believed the thylacine to prey regularly upon farmers' sheep and poultry. However, analysis by Robert Paddle suggests that there is little evidence that thylacines were significant predators of sheep or poultry (though some accounts suggest that they may have attacked them on occasion), with many sheep deaths likely caused by feral dog attacks instead. Throughout the 20th century, the thylacine was often characterised as primarily a blood drinker; according to Robert Paddle, the story's popularity seems to have originated from a single second-hand account heard by Geoffrey Smith (1881\u20131916) in a shepherd's hut.\nRecent studies suggest that the thylacine was probably not suited for hunting large prey. A 2007 study argued that, while it could open its jaws wide like modern mammalian predators that consume large prey, the canine of the thylacine was not suited for slashing bites like that of large canids, indicating, based on the assumption that the bite was largely derived by its skull, that it hunted small to medium-sized prey as a solitary hunter. A 2011 study by the University of New South Wales using advanced computer modelling indicated that the thylacine had surprisingly feeble jaws; animals usually take prey close to their own body size, but an adult thylacine of around was found to be incapable of handling prey much larger than , suggesting that the thylacine only ate smaller animals such as bandicoots, pademelons and possums, and that it may have directly competed with the Tasmanian devil and the tiger quoll. Another study in 2020 produced similar results, after estimating the average body mass of thylacine as about rather than , suggesting that the animal did indeed hunt much smaller prey, although it was capable of taking down larger prey when necessary. The cranial and facial morphology also indicate that the thylacine would have hunted prey less than 45% of its own body mass, consistent with modern carnivores weighing under which is about the average size of a thylacine.\nA 2005 study showed that the thylacine had a high bite force quotient of 166, which was similar to that of most quolls, indicating that it may have been able to hunt larger prey relative to its body size. A 2007 study also suggested that it would have had a much stronger bite force than a dingo of similar size, though this particular study argued that the thylacine would have hunted smaller prey. A biomechanical analysis of the 3D skull model suggested that the thylacine would have likely consumed smaller prey, with its skull displaying high levels of stress that are not suited to withstand forces, and with its bite forces being estimated at a smaller value than that of Tasmanian devils. A 2014 study compared the skull of a thylacine with that of modern dasyurids and an earlier thylacinid taxon \"Nimbacinus\" based on biomechanical analysis of their 3D skull models; the authors suggested that while \"Nimbacinus\" was suited to hunt large prey with a maximum muscle force of which are similar to that of large Tasmanian devils, the thylacine skull displayed a much higher stress in all areas compared to its relatives due to its longer snout. If the thylacine were indeed specialised for small prey, this specialisation likely made it susceptible to small disturbances to the ecosystem.\nIt has been suggested on the basis of the canine teeth and limb bones that the thylacine was a solitary pounce-pursuit predator that hunted smaller prey with trophic niches similar to relatively smaller canids like the coyote, and that it was not as specialised as large canids, hyaenids and felids of today: its canine lacked the adaptation for producing slashing or deep penetrating bites, and its anatomy was not suited for running fast in high speed. However, the trappers reported it as an ambush predator hunting alone or in pairs mainly at night. The elbow joint morphology and the forelimb anatomy of the thylacine also suggest that the animal was most likely an ambush predator.\nThe stomach of a thylacine was very muscular, capable of distending to allow the animal to eat large amounts of food at one time, probably an adaptation to compensate for long periods when hunting was unsuccessful and food scarce. In captivity, thylacines were fed a wide variety of foods, including dead rabbits and wallabies as well as beef, mutton, horse and, occasionally, poultry. There is a report of a captive thylacine that refused to eat dead wallaby flesh or to kill and eat a live wallaby offered to it, but \"ultimately it was persuaded to eat by having the smell of blood from a freshly killed wallaby put before its nose.\"\nExtinction.\nDying out on the Australian mainland.\nAustralia lost more than 90% of its megafauna around 50\u201340,000 years ago as part of the Quaternary extinction event, with the notable exceptions of several kangaroo and wombat species, emus, cassowaries, large goannas, and the thylacine. The extinctions included the even larger carnivore \"Thylacoleo carnifex\" (sometimes called the marsupial lion) which was only distantly related to the thylacine. A 2010 paper examining this issue showed that humans were likely to be one of the major factors in the extinction of many species in Australia although the authors of the research warned that one-factor explanations might be over-simplistic. The youngest radiocarbon dates of the thylacine in mainland Australia are around 3,500 years old, with an estimated extinction date around 3,200 years ago, synchronous with that of Tasmanian devil, and closely co-inciding with the earliest records of the dingo, as well as an intensification of human activity.\nA study proposes that the dingo may have led to the extinction of the thylacine in mainland Australia because the dingo outcompeted the thylacine in preying on the Tasmanian nativehen. The dingo is also more likely to hunt in packs than the more solitary thylacine. Examinations of dingo and thylacine skulls show that although the dingo had a weaker bite, its skull could resist greater stresses, allowing it to pull down larger prey than the thylacine. Because it was a hypercarnivore, the thylacine was less versatile in its diet than the omnivorous dingo. Their ranges appear to have overlapped because thylacine subfossil remains have been discovered near those of dingoes. Aside from wild dingoes, the adoption of the dingo as a hunting companion by the indigenous peoples would have put the thylacine under increased pressure.\nA 2013 study suggested that, while dingoes were a contributing factor to the thylacine's demise on the mainland, larger factors were the intense human population growth, technological advances, and the abrupt change in the climate during the period. A report published in the \"Journal of Biogeography\" detailed an investigation into the mitochondrial DNA and radio-carbon dating of thylacine bones. It concluded that the thylacine died out on mainland Australia in a relatively short time span.\nKen Mulvaney has suggested, based on the high number of rock carvings of the thylacine on the Burrup Peninsula, Aboriginal Australians were aware of, and concerned about the thylacine's dwindling numbers around that time.\nDying out on Tasmania.\nAlthough the thylacine had died out on mainland Australia, it survived into the 1930s on the island of Tasmania. At the time of the first European settlement, the heaviest distributions were in the northeast, northwest and north-midland regions of the state. There were an estimated 5,000 at the time. They were rarely sighted but slowly began to be credited with numerous attacks on sheep. This led to the establishment of bounty schemes in an attempt to control their numbers. The Van Diemen's Land Company introduced bounties on the thylacine from as early as 1830, and between 1888 and 1909, the Tasmanian government paid \u00a31 per head for dead adult thylacines and ten shillings for pups. In all, they paid out 2,184 bounties, but it is thought that many more thylacines were killed than were claimed for. Its extinction is popularly attributed to these relentless efforts by farmers and bounty hunters.\nAside from persecution, it is likely that multiple factors rapidly compounded its decline and eventual extinction, including competition with wild dogs introduced by European settlers, erosion of its habitat, already-low genetic diversity, the concurrent extinction or decline of prey species, and a distemper-like disease that affected many captive specimens at the time. A study from 2012 suggested that the disease was likely introduced by humans, and that it was also present in the wild population. The marsupi-carnivore disease, as it became known, dramatically reduced the lifespan of the animal and greatly increased pup mortality.\nA 1921 photo by Henry Burrell of a thylacine with a chicken was widely distributed and may have helped secure the animal's reputation as a poultry thief. The image had been cropped to hide the fact that the animal was in captivity, and analysis by one researcher has concluded that this thylacine was a dead specimen, posed for the camera. The photograph may even have involved photo manipulation.\nThe animal had become extremely rare in the wild by the late 1920s. Despite the fact that the thylacine was believed by many to be responsible for attacks on sheep, in 1928 the Tasmanian Advisory Committee for Native Fauna recommended a reserve similar to the Savage River National Park to protect any remaining thylacines, with potential sites of suitable habitat including the Arthur-Pieman area of western Tasmania.\nBy the beginning of the 20th century, the increasing rarity of thylacines led to increased demand for captive specimens by zoos around the world, placing yet more pressure on an already small population. Despite the export of breeding pairs, attempts at rearing thylacines in captivity were unsuccessful, and the last thylacine outside Australia died at the London Zoo in 1931.\nThe last known thylacine to be killed in the wild was shot in 1930 by Wilf Batty, a farmer from Mawbanna in the state's northwest. The animal, believed to have been a male, had been seen around Batty's house for several weeks.\nWork in 2012 examined the relationship of the genetic diversity of the thylacines before their extinction. The results indicated that the last of the thylacines in Tasmania had limited genetic diversity due to their complete geographic isolation from mainland Australia. Further investigations in 2017 showed evidence that this decline in genetic diversity started long before the arrival of humans in Australia, possibly starting as early as 70\u2013120 thousand years ago.\nThe thylacine held the status of endangered species until the 1980s. International standards at the time stated that an animal could not be declared extinct until 50 years had passed without a confirmed record. Since no definitive proof of the thylacine's existence in the wild had been obtained for more than 50 years, it met that official criterion and was declared extinct by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in 1982 and by the Tasmanian government in 1986. The species was removed from Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) in 2013.\nLast of the species.\nThe last captive thylacine, lived as an endling (the known last of its species) at Hobart Zoo until its death on the night of 7 September 1936. The animal was captured by Elias Churchill with a snare trap and was sold to the zoo in May 1936. The sale was not publicly announced because the use of traps was illegal and Churchill could have been fined. After its death, the remains of the endling were transferred to the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery. The remains were not properly recorded by the museum because the animal had been caught illegally. It lay undiscovered for decades until a taxidermist record dated from 1936 or 1937 mentioning the animal was noticed. This led to a full audit of all thylacine remains at the museum and the endling's successful identification at the end of 2022.\nIn May 1968, an individual named Frank Darby, claiming to be a curator at the Hobart Zoo, invented the myth that the endling was called Benjamin. Darby discussed the matter with the Victorian naturalist Graham Pizzey, and the account entered the Melbourne press and exploded in popularity. Despite being regularly debunked over the years due to Darby never working at the zoo and clearly being unfamiliar with the species, the myth continues to circulate even in modern-day media, with Wikipedia itself repeating the invention. \nAccording to researchers Robert Paddle and Kathryn Medlock, the Hobart zoo thylacine was in fact a female. However, researcher Gareth Linnard states that despite the \"Benjamin\" invention, the thylacine was male. According to Paddle, the animal is believed to have died as the result of neglect\u2014locked out of its sheltered sleeping quarters, it was exposed to a rare occurrence of extreme Tasmanian weather: extreme heat during the day and freezing temperatures at night. Linnard argues that it died of old age rather than neglect, due to its valued status in the zoo's collection. \nThis thylacine features in the last known motion picture footage of a living specimen: 45 seconds of black-and-white footage showing the thylacine in its enclosure in a clip taken in 1933, by naturalist David Fleay. In the film footage, the thylacine is seen seated, walking around the perimeter of its enclosure, yawning, sniffing the air, scratching itself (in the same manner as a dog), and lying down. Fleay was bitten on the buttock whilst shooting the film. In 2021, a digitally colourised 80-second clip of Fleay's footage of the thylacine was released by the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia, to mark National Threatened Species Day. The digital colourisation process was based on historic primary and secondary descriptions to ensure an accurate colour match.\nAlthough there had been a conservation movement pressing for the thylacine's protection since 1901, driven in part by the increasing difficulty in obtaining specimens for overseas collections, political difficulties prevented any form of protection coming into force until 1936. Official protection of the species by the Tasmanian government came all too late; it was introduced on 10 July 1936, 59 days before the last known specimen died in captivity.\nSearches and unconfirmed sightings.\nBetween 1967 and 1973, zoologist Jeremy Griffith and dairy farmer James Malley conducted what is regarded as the most intensive search for thylacines ever carried out, including exhaustive surveys along Tasmania's west coast, installation of automatic camera stations, prompt investigations of claimed sightings, and in 1972 the creation of the Thylacine Expeditionary Research Team with Dr. Bob Brown, which concluded without finding any evidence of the thylacine's existence.\nThe Department of Conservation and Land Management recorded 203 reports of sightings of the thylacine in Western Australia from 1936 to 1998. On the mainland, sightings are most frequently reported in Southern Victoria.\nAccording to the Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment, there have been eight unconfirmed thylacine sighting reports between 2016 and 2019, with the latest unconfirmed visual sighting on 25 February 2018.\nSince the disappearance and effective extinction of the thylacine, speculation and searches for a living specimen have become a topic of interest to some members of the cryptozoology subculture. The search for the animal has been the subject of books and articles, with many reported sightings that are largely regarded as dubious.\nA 2023 study published by Brook et al. compiles many of the alleged sightings of thylacines in Tasmania throughout the 20th century and claims that, contrary to beliefs that the thylacine went extinct in the 1930s, the Tasmanian thylacine may have actually lasted throughout the 20th century, with a window of extinction between the 1980s and the present day and the likely extinction date being between the late 1990s and early 2000s.\nIn 1983, the American media mogul Ted Turner offered a $100,000 reward for proof of the continued existence of the thylacine. In March 2005, Australian news magazine \"The Bulletin\", as part of its 125th anniversary celebrations, offered a $1.25\u00a0million reward for the safe capture of a live thylacine. When the offer closed at the end of June 2005, no one had produced any evidence of the animal's existence. An offer of $1.75\u00a0million has subsequently been offered by a Tasmanian tour operator, Stewart Malcolm.\nResearch.\nResearch into thylacines relies heavily on specimens held in museums and other institutions across the world. The number and distribution of these specimens has been recorded in the International Thylacine Specimen Database. As of 2022, 756 specimens are held in 115 museums and university collections in 23 countries. In 2017, a reference library of 159 micrographic images of thylacine hair was jointly produced by CSIRO and Where Light Meets Dark.\nPossible revival.\nThe Australian Museum in Sydney began a cloning project in 1999. The goal was to use genetic material from specimens taken and preserved in the early 20th century to clone new individuals and restore the species from extinction. Several molecular biologists dismissed the project as a public relations stunt. In late 2002, the researchers had some success as they were able to extract replicable DNA from the specimens. On 15 February 2005, the museum announced that it was stopping the project. In May 2005, the project was restarted by a group of interested universities and a research institute.\nIn August 2022, it was announced that the University of Melbourne would partner with Texas-based biotechnology company Colossal Biosciences to attempt to re-create the thylacine using its closest living relative, the fat-tailed dunnart, and return it to Tasmania. The university had recently sequenced the genome of a juvenile thylacine specimen and was establishing a thylacine genetic restoration laboratory. The research from the University of Melbourne was led by Andrew Pask. The project was regarded with scepticism by other, uninvolved scientists.\nDNA sequencing.\nA draft whole genome sequencing of the thylacine was produced by Feigin et al. (2017) using the DNA extracted from an ethanol-preserved pouch of a young specimen provided by Museums Victoria. The neonatal development of the thylacine was also reconstructed from preserved pouch young specimens from several museum collections. Researchers used the genome to study aspects of the thylacine's evolution and natural history, including the genetic basis of its convergence with canids, clarifying its evolutionary relationships with other marsupials and examining changes in its population size over time.\nThe genomic basis of the convergent evolution between the thylacine and grey wolf was further investigated in 2019, with researchers identifying many non-coding genomic regions displaying accelerated rates of evolution, a test for genetic regions evolving under positive selection. In 2021, researchers further identified a link between the convergent skull shapes of the thylacine and wolf, and the previously identified genetic candidates. It was reported that specific groups of skull bones, which develop from a common population of stem cells called neural crest cells, showed strong similarity between the thylacine and wolf and corresponded with the underlying convergent genetic candidates which influence these cells during development. In 2023, RNA was extracted from a 130-year-old thylacine specimen in Sweden; this represented the first time RNA has been extracted from an extinct species. In October 2024, a 99.9% thylacine genome was sequenced from a well-preserved skull that is estimated to be 110-year-old, allowing for the full genome of the species to be sequenced three months later.\nCultural significance.\nOfficial usage.\nThe thylacine has been used extensively as a symbol of Tasmania. The animal is featured on the official Tasmanian coat of arms. It is used in the official logos for the Tasmanian government and the City of Launceston. It is also used on the University of Tasmania's ceremonial mace and the badge of the submarine . Since 1998, it has been prominently displayed on Tasmanian vehicle number plates. The thylacine has appeared in postage stamps from Australia, Equatorial Guinea, and Micronesia.\nSince 1996, 7 September (the date in 1936 on which the last known thylacine died) has been commemorated in Australia as National Threatened Species Day.\nIn popular culture.\nThe thylacine has become a cultural icon in Australia. The best known illustrations of \"Thylacinus cynocephalus\" were those in John Gould's \"The Mammals of Australia\" (1845\u20131863), often copied since its publication and the most frequently reproduced, and given further exposure by Cascade Brewery's appropriation for its label in 1987. The government of Tasmania published a monochromatic reproduction of the same image in 1934, the author Louisa Anne Meredith also copied it for \"Tasmanian Friends and Foes\" (1881). The thylacine is the mascot for the Tasmanian cricket team. A series of postage stamps that feature Mickey Mouse characters with Australian animals features a thylacine stamp in the collection.\nIn video games, boomerang-wielding \"Ty the Tasmanian Tiger\" is the star of his own trilogy during the 2000s. Tiny Tiger, a villain in the popular \"Crash Bandicoot\" video game series, is a mutated thylacine. In \"Valorant\", agent Skye has the ability to use a Tasmanian tiger to scout enemies and clear bomb-planting sites.\nThe animal has made appearance in film and television. Characters in the early 1990s' cartoon \"Taz-Mania\" included the neurotic Wendell T. Wolf, the last surviving Tasmanian wolf. \"The Hunter\" is a 2011 Australian drama film, based on the 1999 novel of the same name by Julia Leigh. It stars Willem Dafoe, who plays a man hired to track down the Tasmanian tiger. In the 2021 film, \"Extinct\", a thylacine named Burnie, along with a group of other extinct animals, help the movie's main characters travel through time to rescue their species from extinction. In the 2022 science-fiction show \"The Peripheral\" the Tasmanian tiger is brought back into existence from DNA extracts. An animated web series titled \"De-extincting Tasie\" meant to explain the revival of the species by Colossal Biosciences and University of Melbourne features a thylacine named Tasie, a satire of the Mr. DNA character from the Jurassic Park media franchise.\nIn Aboriginal tradition.\nRock art featuring thylacine-like animals are found throughout Northern Australia, particularly in the Kimberley region.\nVarious Aboriginal Tasmanian names for the thylacine have been recorded, such as \"coorinna\", \"kanunnah\", \"cab-berr-one-nen-er\", \"loarinna\", \"laoonana\", \"can-nen-ner\" and \"lagunta\", while \"kaparunina\" is used in Palawa kani.\nOne Nuenonne myth recorded by Jackson Cotton tells of a thylacine pup saving Palana, a spirit boy, from an attack by a giant kangaroo. Palana marked the pup's back with ochre as a mark of its bravery, giving thylacines their stripes. A constellation, \"Wurrawana Corinna\" (identified as within or near Gemini), was also created as a commemoration of this mythic act of bravery.\nAn early European record tells how Aboriginals believed bad weather was caused by a thylacine carcass being left exposed on the ground, instead of being covered by a small shelter.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "30391", "revid": "4492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30391", "title": "Theodor W. Adorno", "text": "German philosopher, sociologist, and theorist (1903\u20131969)\nTheodor W. Adorno ( ; ; born Theodor Ludwig Wiesengrund; 11 September 1903 \u2013 6 August 1969) was a German philosopher, musicologist, and social theorist. He was a leading member of the Frankfurt School of critical theory, whose work has come to be associated with thinkers such as Ernst Bloch, Walter Benjamin, Max Horkheimer, Erich Fromm, and Herbert Marcuse, for whom the works of Sigmund Freud, Karl Marx, and G. W. F. Hegel were essential to a critique of modern society. As a critic of both fascism and what he called the culture industry, his writings\u2014such as \"Dialectic of Enlightenment\" (1947), \"Minima Moralia\" (1951), and \"Negative Dialectics\" (1966)\u2014strongly influenced the European New Left.\nIn an intellectual climate shaped by existentialism and logical positivism, Adorno developed a dialectical conception of history and philosophy that challenged the foundations of both, anticipating the divide that would later emerge between the analytic and continental traditions. As a classically trained musician, Adorno studied composition with Alban Berg of the Second Viennese School, influenced by his early admiration for the music of Arnold Schoenberg. Adorno's commitment to avant-garde music formed the backdrop of his subsequent writings and led to his collaboration with Thomas Mann on the latter's novel \"Doctor Faustus\" (1947), while the two men lived in California as exiles during the Second World War. Working at the newly relocated Institute for Social Research, Adorno collaborated on influential studies of authoritarianism, antisemitism, and propaganda that would later serve as models for sociological studies the institute carried out in post-war Germany.\nUpon his return to Frankfurt, Adorno was involved with the reconstitution of German intellectual life through debates with Karl Popper on the limitations of positivist science, critiques of Martin Heidegger's language of authenticity, writings on German responsibility for the Holocaust, and continued interventions into matters of public policy. As a writer of polemics in the tradition of Friedrich Nietzsche and Karl Kraus, Adorno delivered scathing critiques of contemporary Western culture. Adorno's posthumously published \"Aesthetic Theory\" (1970), which he had planned to dedicate to Samuel Beckett, is the culmination of a lifelong commitment to modern art, which attempts to revoke the \"fatal separation\" of feeling and understanding long demanded by the history of philosophy, and explode the privilege aesthetics accords to content over form and contemplation over immersion. Adorno was nominated for the 1965 Nobel Prize in Literature by Helmut Viebrock.\nLife and career.\nEarly years: Frankfurt.\nTheodor W. Adorno was born as Theodor Ludwig Wiesengrund in Frankfurt on 11 September 1903, the only child of Maria Calvelli-Adorno della Piana (1865\u20131952) and Oscar Alexander Wiesengrund (1870\u20131946). His mother, a Catholic from Corsica, was once a professional singer, while his father, an assimilated Jew who had converted to Protestantism, ran a successful wine-export business. His mother wanted her son's surname to include her own, Adorno. Thus, his earliest publications carried the name Theodor Wiesengrund-Adorno. Upon his application for US citizenship, his father's surname, Wiesengrund, was dropped from the name.\nHis childhood was marked by the musical life provided by his mother and aunt. Maria was a singer who could boast of having performed in Vienna at the Imperial Court, while her sister, Agathe, who lived with them, had made a name for herself as both a singer and pianist. He was not only a precocious child but, as he recalled later in life, a child prodigy who could play pieces by Beethoven on the piano by the time he was twelve.\nAt the age of six, he attended the Deutschherren Middle School before transferring to the Kaiser-Wilhelm Gymnasium, where he studied from 1913 to 1921. Before his graduation at the top of his class, Adorno was already swept up by the revolutionary mood of the time, as is evidenced by his reading of Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs's \"The Theory of the Novel\" that year, as well as by his fascination with Ernst Bloch's \"The Spirit of Utopia\", of which he would later write:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Bloch's was a philosophy that could hold its head high before the most advanced literature; a philosophy that was not calibrated to the abominable resignation of methodology ... I took this motif so much as my own that I do not believe I have ever written anything without reference to it, either implicit or explicit.Adorno's intellectual nonconformism was also shaped by the repugnance he felt towards the nationalism that swept through the Reich during the First World War. Along with future collaborators Walter Benjamin, Max Horkheimer, and Bloch, Adorno was profoundly disillusioned by the ease with which Germany's intellectual and spiritual leaders\u2014among them Max Weber, Max Scheler, Georg Simmel, as well as his friend Siegfried Kracauer\u2014came out in support of the war. The younger generation's distrust for traditional knowledge arose from how this tradition had discredited itself. Over time, Oscar Wiesengrund's firm established close professional and personal ties with the factory of Karplus &amp; Herzberger in Berlin. The eldest daughter of the Karplus family, Margarete, or Gretel, moved into the intellectual circles of Berlin, where she became acquainted with Benjamin, Bertolt Brecht, and Bloch, each of whom Adorno would become familiar with during the mid-1920s. After fourteen years, Gretel Karplus and Adorno were married in 1937.\nAt the end of his schooldays, Adorno not only benefited from the rich concert offerings of Frankfurt\u2014where one could hear performances of works by Schoenberg, Schreker, Stravinsky, Bart\u00f3k, Busoni, Delius, and Hindemith\u2014but also began studying music composition at the Hoch Conservatory while taking private lessons with well-respected composers Bernhard Sekles and Eduard Jung. At around the same time, he befriended Siegfried Kracauer, the \"Frankfurter Zeitung\"'s literary editor, of whom he would later write:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For years Kracauer read [Kant's] \"Critique of Pure Reason\" with me regularly on Saturday afternoons. I am not exaggerating in the slightest when I say that I owe more to this reading than to my academic teachers ... Under his guidance, I experienced the work from the beginning not as mere epistemology, not as an analysis of the conditions of scientifically valid judgments, but as a kind of coded text from which the historical situation of spirit could be read, with the vague expectation that in doing so one could acquire something of truth itself.\nLeaving grammar school to study philosophy, psychology and sociology at Johann Wolfgang Goethe University in Frankfurt, Adorno continued his readings with Kracauer, turning now to Hegel and Kierkegaard, and began publishing concert reviews and pieces of music for distinguished journals like the \"Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik\", the \"Neue Bl\u00e4tter f\u00fcr Kunst und Literatur\" and later for the \"Musikbl\u00e4tter des Anbruch\". In these articles, Adorno championed avant-garde music at the same time as he critiqued the failings of musical modernity, as in the case of Stravinsky's \"The Soldier's Tale\", which in 1923 he called a \"dismal Bohemian prank\". In these early writings, he was unequivocal in his condemnation of performances that either sought or pretended to achieve a transcendence that Adorno, in line with many intellectuals of the time, regarded as impossible. \"No cathedral\", he wrote, \"can be built if no community desires one.\" In the summer of 1924 Adorno received his doctorate with a study of Edmund Husserl under the direction of the unorthodox neo-Kantian Hans Cornelius. Before his graduation, Adorno had already met his most important intellectual collaborators, Horkheimer and Benjamin. It was through Cornelius's seminars that Adorno met Horkheimer, through whom he was then introduced to Friedrich Pollock.\nVienna, Frankfurt, and Berlin.\nDuring the summer of 1924, the Viennese composer Alban Berg's Three Fragments from \"Wozzeck\", premiered in Frankfurt, at which time Adorno introduced himself to Berg, and both agreed the young philosopher and composer would study with Berg in Vienna. Upon moving to Vienna in February 1925, Adorno immersed himself in the musical culture that had grown up around Schoenberg. In addition to his twice-weekly sessions with Berg, Adorno continued his studies on piano with Eduard Steuermann and befriended the violinist Rudolf Kolisch. In Vienna, he and Berg attended public lectures by the satirist Karl Kraus, and he met Luk\u00e1cs, who had been living in Vienna after the failure of the Hungarian Soviet Republic. Berg, whom Adorno called \"my master and teacher\", was among the most prescient of his young pupil's early friends:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[I am] convinced that, in the sphere of the deepest understanding of music ... you are capable of supreme achievements and will undoubtedly fulfill this promise in the shape of great philosophical works.\nAfter leaving Vienna, Adorno traveled through Italy, where he met with Kracauer, Benjamin, and the economist Alfred Sohn-Rethel, with whom he developed a lasting friendship, before returning to Frankfurt. In December 1926 Adorno's Two Pieces for string quartet, Op. 2, was performed in Vienna, which provided a welcome interruption from his preparations for the habilitation. After writing the Piano Pieces in strict twelve-tone technique, as well as songs later integrated into the Six Bagatelles for voice and piano, Op. 6, Adorno presented his habilitation manuscript, \"The Concept of the Unconscious in the Transcendental Theory of the Psyche\" (\"Der Begriff des Unbewu\u00dften in der transzendentalen Seelenlehre\"), to Cornelius in November 1927. Cornelius advised Adorno to withdraw his application because the manuscript was too close to his own way of thinking. In the manuscript, Adorno attempted to underline the epistemological status of the unconscious as it emerged from Freud's early writings. Against the function of the unconscious in both Nietzsche and Spengler, Adorno argued that Freud's notion of the unconscious serves as a \"sharp weapon ... against every attempt to create a metaphysics of the instincts and to deify full, organic nature.\" Undaunted by his academic prospects, Adorno threw himself once again into composition. In addition to publishing numerous reviews of opera performances and concerts, Adorno's Four Songs for medium voice and piano, Op. 3, was performed in Berlin in January 1929. Between 1928 and 1930 Adorno took on a greater role within the editorial committee of the \"Musikbl\u00e4tter des Anbruch\". In a proposal for transforming the journal, he sought to use \"Anbruch\" to champion radical modern music against what he called the \"stabilized music\" of Pfitzner, the later Richard Strauss, as well as the neoclassicism of Stravinsky and Hindemith. During this period he published the essays \"Night Music\", \"On Twelve-Tone Technique\" and \"Reaction and Progress\". Yet his reservations about twelve-tone orthodoxy became steadily more pronounced. According to Adorno, twelve-tone technique's use of atonality can no more be regarded as an authoritative canon than can tonality be relied on to provide instructions for the composer.\nAt this time Adorno struck up a correspondence with the composer Ernst Krenek, discussing problems of atonality and the twelve-tone technique. In a 1934 letter, he sounded a related criticism of Schoenberg:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Twelve-tone technique alone is nothing but the principle of motivic elaboration and variation, as developed in the sonata, but elevated now to a comprehensive principle of construction, namely transformed into an \"a priori\" form and, by that token, detached from the surface of the composition.\nAt this point Adorno reversed his earlier priorities: now his musical activities came second to the development of a philosophical theory of aesthetics. Thus, in the middle of 1929, he accepted Paul Tillich's offer to present a habilitation on Kierkegaard, which Adorno eventually submitted under the title \"The Construction of the Aesthetic\". At the time, Kierkegaard's philosophy exerted a strong influence, chiefly through its claim to pose an alternative to Idealism and Hegel's philosophy of history. Yet when Adorno turned his attention to Kierkegaard, watchwords like \"anxiety\", \"inwardness\", and \"leap\"\u2014instructive for existentialist philosophy\u2014were detached from their theological origins and posed, instead, as problems for aesthetics. As the work proceeded\u2014and Kierkegaard's overcoming of Hegel's idealism was revealed to be a mere interiorization\u2014Adorno excitedly remarked in a letter to Berg that he was writing without looking over his shoulder at the faculty who would soon evaluate his work. Receiving favorable reports from Professors Tillich and Horkheimer, as well as Benjamin and Kracauer, the university conferred on Adorno the \"venia legendi\" in February 1931. On the very day his revised study was published, 23 March 1933, Hitler seized dictatorial powers.\nSeveral months after qualifying as a lecturer in philosophy, Adorno delivered an inaugural lecture at the Institute for Social Research, an independent organization that had recently appointed Horkheimer as its director and, with the arrival of the literary scholar Leo L\u00f6wenthal, social psychologist Erich Fromm, and philosopher Herbert Marcuse, sought to exploit recent theoretical and methodological advances in the social sciences. His lecture \"The Actuality of Philosophy\" created a scandal. In it Adorno not only deviated from the theoretical program Horkheimer had laid out a year earlier but challenged philosophy's very capacity for comprehending reality as such: \"For the mind\", Adorno announced, \"is indeed not capable of producing or grasping the totality of the real, but it may be possible to penetrate the detail, to explode in miniature the mass of merely existing reality.\" In line with Benjamin's \"The Origin of German Tragic Drama\" and preliminary sketches of the Arcades Project, Adorno likened philosophical interpretation to experiments that should be conducted \"until they arrive at figurations in which the answers are legible, while the questions themselves vanish.\" Having lost its position as the Queen of the Sciences, philosophy must now radically transform its approach to objects so that it might \"construct keys before which reality springs open.\"\nFollowing Horkheimer's taking up the directorship of the Institute, a new journal, \"Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Sozialforschung\", was produced to publish the research of Institute members both before and after its relocation to the United States. Though Adorno was not an Institute member, the journal published many of his essays, including \"The Social Situation of Music\" (1932), \"On Jazz\" (1936), \"On the Fetish-Character in Music and the Regression of Listening\" (1938), and \"Fragments on Wagner\" (1938). In his new role as a social theorist, Adorno's philosophical analysis of cultural phenomena heavily relied on the language of historical materialism, as concepts like reification, false consciousness, and ideology came to play an ever more prominent role in his work. At the same time, however, and owing to both the presence of another prominent sociologist at the institute, Karl Mannheim, as well as the methodological problem posed by treating objects\u2014like \"musical material\"\u2014as ciphers of social contradictions, Adorno was compelled to abandon any notion of \"value-free\" sociology in favor of a form of ideology critique that held on to an idea of truth. Before his emigration in the autumn of 1934, Adorno began work on a \"Singspiel\" based on Mark Twain's \"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\" titled \"The Treasure of Indian Joe\", which he never completed. By the time he fled Hitler's Germany, Adorno had already written over 100 opera or concert reviews and 50 critiques of music composition.\nAs the Nazi party became the largest party in the Reichstag, Horkheimer's 1932 observation proved typical for his milieu: \"Only one thing is certain\", he wrote, \"the irrationality of society has reached a point where only the gloomiest predictions have any plausibility.\" In September Adorno's right to teach was revoked. In March, as the swastika was run up the flagpole of the town hall, the Frankfurt criminal police searched the Institute's offices. Adorno's house on Seeheimer Strasse was similarly searched in July and his application for membership in the Reich Chamber of Literature was denied on the grounds that membership was limited to \"persons who belong to the German nation by profound ties of character and blood. As a \"non-Aryan\", he was informed, \"you are unable to feel and appreciate such an obligation.\" Soon afterward, Adorno was forced into 15 years of exile.\nExile: Oxford, New York, Los Angeles.\nAfter the possibility of transferring his habilitation to the University of Vienna came to nothing, Adorno considered relocating to Britain upon his father's suggestion. With the help of the Academic Assistance Council, Adorno registered as an advanced student at Merton College, Oxford, in June 1934. During the next four years at Oxford, Adorno made repeated trips to Germany to see both his parents and Gretel, who was still working in Berlin. Under the direction of Gilbert Ryle, Adorno worked on a dialectical critique of Edmund Husserl's epistemology. By this time, the Institute for Social Research had relocated to New York City and begun making overtures to Adorno. After months of strained relations, Horkheimer and Adorno reestablished their essential theoretical alliance during meetings in Paris. Adorno continued writing on music, publishing, \"The Form of the Phonograph Record\" and \"Crisis of Music Criticism\" in the Viennese musical journal \"23\", \"On Jazz\" in the institute's \"Zeitschrift\", \"Farewell to Jazz\" in \"Europ\u00e4ische Revue\". But Adorno's attempts to break out of the sociology of music were twice thwarted: neither the study of Mannheim he had been working on for years nor extracts from his study of Husserl were accepted by the \"Zeitschrift\". Impressed by Horkheimer's book of aphorisms, \"Dawn and Decline\", Adorno began working on his own book of aphorisms, which later became \"Minima Moralia\". While at Oxford, Adorno suffered two great losses: his Aunt Agathe died in June 1935, and Berg died in December of the same year. To the end of his life, Adorno never abandoned the hope of completing Berg's unfinished opera Lulu.\nAt this time, Adorno was in intense correspondence with Walter Benjamin about the latter's \"Arcades Project\". After receiving an invitation from Horkheimer to visit the Institute in New York, Adorno sailed for New York on 9 June 1937 and stayed for two weeks. While he was in New York, Horkheimer's essays \"The Latest Attack on Metaphysics\" and \"Traditional and Critical Theory\", which would soon become instructive for the institute's self-understanding, were the subject of intense discussion. Soon after his return to Europe, Gretel moved to Britain, where she and Adorno were married on 8 September 1937. A little over a month later, Horkheimer telegrammed from New York with news of a position Adorno could take with the Princeton Radio Project, then under the directorship of the Austrian sociologist Paul Lazarsfeld. Yet Adorno's work continued with studies of Beethoven and Richard Wagner (published in 1939 as \"Fragments on Wagner\"), drafts of which he read to Benjamin during their final meeting, in December on the Italian Riviera. According to Benjamin, these drafts were astonishing for \"the precision of their materialist deciphering\" as well as the way in which \"musical facts ... had been made socially transparent in a way that was completely new to me.\" In his Wagner study, the thesis later to characterize \"Dialectic of Enlightenment\"\u2014man's domination of nature\u2014first emerges. Adorno sailed for New York on 16 February 1938. Soon after settling into his new home on Riverside Drive, Adorno met with Lazarsfeld in Newark, New Jersey, to discuss the Project's plans for investigating the impact of broadcast music.\nAlthough he was expected to embed the Project's research within a wider theoretical context, it soon became apparent that the Project was primarily concerned with data collection to be used by administrators for establishing whether groups of listeners could be targeted by broadcasts specifically aimed at them. Expected to make use of devices with which listeners could press a button to indicate whether they liked or disliked a particular piece of music, Adorno bristled with distaste and astonishment: \"I reflected that culture was simply the condition that precluded a mentality that tried to measure it.\" Thus Adorno suggested using individual interviews to determine listener reactions and, only three months after meeting Lazarsfeld, completed a 160-page memorandum on the Project's topic, \"Music in Radio\". Adorno was primarily interested in how musical material was affected by its distribution through the medium of radio and thought it imperative to understand how music was affected by its becoming part of daily life. \"The meaning of a Beethoven symphony\", he wrote, \"heard while the listener is walking around or lying in bed is very likely to differ from its effect in a concert hall where people sit as if they were in church.\" In essays published by the institute's \"Zeitschrift\", Adorno dealt with the atrophy of musical culture that had become instrumental in accelerating tendencies\u2014toward conformism, trivialization, and standardization\u2014already present in the larger culture. Unsurprisingly, Adorno's studies found little resonance among members of the Project. At the end of 1939, when Lazarsfeld submitted a second application for funding, the musical section of the study was left out. Yet during the two years during which he worked on the Project, Adorno was prolific, publishing \"The Radio Symphony\", \"A Social Critique of Radio Music\", and \"On Popular Music\", texts that, along with the draft memorandum and other unpublished writings, are found in Robert Hullot-Kentor's translation, \"Current of Music\". In light of this situation, Horkheimer soon found a permanent post for Adorno at the Institute.\nIn addition to helping with the \"Zeitschrift\", Adorno was expected to be the institute's liaison with Benjamin, who soon passed on to New York the study of Charles Baudelaire he hoped would serve as a model of the larger \"Arcades Project\". In correspondence, the two men discussed the difference in their conceptions of the relationship between critique and artworks that had become manifest through Benjamin's \"The Work of Art in the Age of its Technical Reproducibility\". At around the same time, Adorno and Horkheimer began planning for a joint work on \"dialectical logic\", which would later become \"Dialectic of Enlightenment\". Alarmed by reports from Europe, where Adorno's parents suffered increasing discrimination and Benjamin was interned in Colombes, they entertained few delusions about their work's practical effects. \"In view of what is now threatening to engulf Europe\", Horkheimer wrote, \"our present work is essentially destined to pass things down through the night that is approaching: a kind of message in a bottle.\" As Adorno continued his work in New York with radio talks on music and a lecture on Kierkegaard's doctrine of love, Benjamin fled Paris and attempted to make an illegal border crossing. After learning that his Spanish visa was invalid and fearing deportation back to France, Benjamin took an overdose of morphine tablets. In light of recent events, the Institute set about formulating a theory of antisemitism and fascism. On one side were those who supported Franz Leopold Neumann's thesis according to which National Socialism was a form of \"monopoly capitalism\"; on the other were those who supported Friedrich Pollock's \"state capitalist theory\". Horkheimer's contributions to this debate, in the form of the essays \"The Authoritarian State\", \"The End of Reason\", and \"The Jews and Europe\", served as a foundation for what he and Adorno planned to do in their book on dialectical logic.\nIn November 1941 Adorno followed Horkheimer to what Thomas Mann called \"German California\", setting up house in a Pacific Palisades neighborhood of German \u00e9migr\u00e9s that included Bertolt Brecht and Schoenberg. Adorno arrived with a draft of his \"Philosophy of New Music\", a dialectical critique of twelve-tone music that Adorno felt, while writing it, was a departure from the theory of art he had spent the previous decades elaborating. Horkheimer's reaction to the manuscript was wholly positive: \"If I have ever in the whole of my life felt enthusiasm about anything, then I did on this occasion\", he wrote after reading the manuscript. The two set about completing their joint work, which transformed from a book on dialectical logic to a rewriting of the history of rationality and the Enlightenment. First published in a small mimeographed edition in May 1944 as \"Philosophical Fragments\", the text waited another three years before achieving book form when it was published with its definitive title, \"Dialectic of Enlightenment\", by the Amsterdam publisher Querido Verlag. This \"reflection on the destructive aspect of progress\" proceeded through the chapters that treated rationality as both the liberation from and further domination of nature, interpretations of both Homer's \"Odyssey\" and the Marquis de Sade, as well as analyses of the culture industry and antisemitism.\nWith their joint work completed, the two turned their attention to studies on antisemitism and authoritarianism in collaboration with the Nevitt Sanford-led Public Opinion Study Group and the American Jewish Committee. In line with these studies, Adorno produced an analysis of the Californian radio preacher Martin Luther Thomas. Fascist propaganda of this sort, Adorno wrote, \"simply takes people for what they are: genuine children of today's standardized mass culture who have been robbed to a great extent of their autonomy and spontaneity\". Adorno wrote that fascist propaganda encourages identification with an authoritarian personality characterized by traits such as obedience and extreme aggression.17The result of these labors, the 1950 study \"The Authoritarian Personality\", was pioneering in its combination of quantitative and qualitative methods of collecting and evaluating data as well as its development of the F-scale personality test.\nAfter the USA entered the war in 1941, the situation of the \u00e9migr\u00e9s, now classed \"enemy aliens\", became increasingly restricted. Forbidden from leaving their homes between 8pm and 6am and from going more than five miles from their houses, \u00e9migr\u00e9s like Adorno, who was not naturalized until November 1943, were severely restricted in their movements.\nIn addition to the aphorisms that conclude \"Dialectic of Enlightenment\", Adorno put together a collection of aphorisms in honor of Horkheimer's 50th birthday that was later published as \"Minima Moralia: Reflections from Damaged Life\". These fragmentary writings, inspired by a renewed reading of Nietzsche, treated issues like emigration, totalitarianism, and individuality, as well as everyday matters such as giving presents, dwelling, and the impossibility of love. In California, Adorno made the acquaintance of Charlie Chaplin and became friends with Fritz Lang and Hanns Eisler, with whom he completed a study of film music in 1944. In this study, the authors pushed for the greater usage of avant-garde music in film, urging that music be used to supplement, not simply accompany, films' visual aspects. Adorno also assisted Thomas Mann with his novel \"Doktor Faustus\" after the latter asked for his help. \"Would you be willing\", Mann wrote, \"to think through with me how the work\u2014I mean Leverk\u00fchn's work\u2014might look; how you would do it if you were in league with the Devil?\"\nAt the end of October 1949, Adorno left America for Europe just as \"The Authoritarian Personality\" was being published. Before his return, Adorno had reached an agreement with a T\u00fcbingen publisher to print an expanded version of \"Philosophy of New Music\" and completed two compositions: \"Four Songs for Voice and Piano by Stefan George, op.7\", and \"Three Choruses for Female Voices from the Poems of Theodor D\u00e4ubler, op. 8\".\nPostwar Europe.\nReturn to Frankfurt University.\nUpon his return, Adorno helped shape the political culture of West Germany. Until his death in 1969, twenty years after his return, Adorno contributed to the intellectual foundations of the Federal Republic, as a professor at the University of Frankfurt am Main, critic of the vogue enjoyed by Heideggerian philosophy, partisan of critical sociology, and teacher of music at the Darmstadt International Summer Courses for New Music. Adorno resumed his teaching duties at the university soon after his arrival, with seminars on \"Kant's Transcendental Dialectic\", aesthetics, Hegel, \"Contemporary Problems in the Theory of Knowledge\", and \"The Concept of Knowledge\". Adorno's surprise at his students' passionate interest in intellectual matters did not, however, blind him to continuing problems within Germany: The literary climate was dominated by writers who had remained in Germany during Hitler's rule, the government re-employed people who had been active in the Nazi apparatus and people were generally loath to own up to their own collaboration or the guilt they thus incurred. Instead, the ruined city of Frankfurt continued as if nothing had happened, holding on to ideas of the true, the beautiful, and the good despite the atrocities, hanging on to a culture that had itself been lost in rubble or killed off in the concentration camps. All the enthusiasm Adorno's students showed for intellectual matters could not erase the suspicion that, in the words of Max Frisch, culture had become an \"alibi\" for the absence of political consciousness. Yet the foundations for what would come to be known as \"The Frankfurt School\" were soon laid: Horkheimer resumed his chair in social philosophy and the Institute for Social Research, rebuilt, became a lightning rod for critical thought.\nEssays on fascism.\nStarting with his 1947 essay \"Wagner, Nietzsche and Hitler\", Adorno produced a series of influential works to describe psychological fascist traits. One of these works was \"The Authoritarian Personality\" (1950), published as a contribution to the \"Studies in Prejudice\" performed by multiple research institutes in the US, and consisting of 'qualitative interpretations' that uncovered the authoritarian character of test persons through indirect questions. The books have had a major influence on sociology and remain highly discussed and debated. In 1951 he continued on the topic with his essay \"Freudian Theory and the Pattern of Fascist Propaganda\", in which he said that \"Psychological dispositions do not actually cause fascism; rather, fascism defines a psychological area which can be successfully exploited by the forces which promote it for entirely non-psychological reasons of self-interest.\"\nIn 1952 Adorno participated in a group experiment, revealing residual National Socialist attitudes among the recently democratized Germans. He then published two influential essays, \"The Meaning of Working Through the Past\" (1959) and \"Education after Auschwitz\" (1966), in which he argued on the survival of the uneradicated National Socialism in the mindsets and institutions of the post-1945 Germany, and that there is still a real risk that it could rise again. Later on, however, Jean Am\u00e9ry\u2014who had been tortured at Auschwitz\u2014would sharply object that Adorno, rather than addressing such political concerns, was exploiting Auschwitz for his metaphysical phantom \"absolute negativity\" (\"absolute Negativit\u00e4t\"), using a language intoxicated by itself (\"von sich selber bis zur Selbstblendung entz\u00fcckte Sprache\").\nPublic events.\nIn September 1951, Adorno returned to the United States for a six-week visit, during which he attended the opening of the Hacker Psychiatry Foundation in Beverly Hills, met Leo L\u00f6wenthal and Herbert Marcuse in New York, and saw his mother for the last time. After stopping in Paris, where he met Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, Michel Leiris, and Ren\u00e9 Leibowitz, Adorno delivered a lecture entitled \"The Present State of Empirical Social Research in Germany\" at a conference on opinion research. Here, he emphasized the importance of data collection and statistical evaluation while asserting that such empirical methods have only an auxiliary function and must lead to the formation of theories which would \"raise the harsh facts to the level of consciousness.\"\nWith Horkheimer as dean of the Arts Faculty, then rector of the university, responsibilities for the institute's work fell upon Adorno. At the same time, however, Adorno renewed his musical work: with talks at the Kranichsteiner Musikgesellschaft, another in connection with a production of Ernst Krenek's opera \"Leben des Orest\", and a seminar on \"Criteria of New Music\" at the Fifth International Summer Course for New Music at Kranichstein. Adorno also became increasingly involved with the publishing house of Peter Suhrkamp, inducing the latter to publish Benjamin's \"Berlin Childhood Around 1900\", Kracauer's writings, and a two-volume edition of Benjamin's writings. Adorno's own recently published \"Minima Moralia\" was not only well received in the press, but also met with great admiration from Thomas Mann, who wrote to Adorno from America in 1952:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I have spent days attached to your book as if by a magnet. Every day brings new fascination ... concentrated nourishment. It is said that the companion star to Sirius, white in colour, is made of such dense material that a cubic inch of it would weigh a tonne here. This is why it has such an extremely powerful gravitational field; in this respect, it is similar to your book.\nYet Adorno was no less moved by other public events: protesting the publication of Heinrich Mann's novel \"Professor Unrat\" with its film title, \"The Blue Angel\"; declaring his sympathy with those who protested the scandal of big-game hunting; and, penning a defense of prostitutes.\nMore essays on mass culture and literature.\nBecause Adorno's American citizenship would have been forfeited by the middle of 1952 had he continued to stay outside the country, he returned once again to Santa Monica to survey his prospects at the Hacker Foundation. While there he wrote a content analysis of newspaper horoscopes (now collected in \"The Stars Down to Earth\"), and the essays \"Television as Ideology\" and \"Prologue to Television\"; even so, he was pleased when, at the end of ten months, he was enjoined to return as co-director of the Institute.\nBack in Frankfurt, he renewed his academic duties and, from 1952 to 1954, completed three essays: \"Notes on Kafka\", \"Val\u00e9ry Proust Museum\", and an essay on Schoenberg following the composer's death, all of which were included in the 1955 essay collection \"Prisms\". In response to the publication of Thomas Mann's \"The Black Swan\", Adorno penned a long letter to the author, who then approved its publication in the literary journal \"Akzente\". A second collection of essays, \"Notes to Literature\", appeared in 1958. After meeting Samuel Beckett while delivering a series of lectures in Paris the same year, Adorno set to work on \"Trying to Understand Endgame\", which, along with studies of Proust, Val\u00e9ry, and Balzac, formed the central texts of the 1961 publication of the second volume of his \"Notes to Literature\". Adorno's entrance into literary discussions continued in his June 1963 lecture at the annual conference of the H\u00f6lderlin Society. At the Philosophers' Conference of October 1962 in M\u00fcnster, at which Habermas wrote that Adorno was \"A writer among bureaucrats\", Adorno presented \"Progress\".\nAlthough the \"Zeitschrift\" was never revived, the Institute nevertheless published a series of important sociological books, including \"Sociologica\" (1955), a collection of essays, \"Gruppenexperiment\" (1955), \"Betriebsklima\", a study of work satisfaction among workers in Mannesmann, and \"Soziologische Exkurse\", a textbook-like anthology intended as an introductory work about the discipline.\nPublic figure.\nThroughout the fifties and sixties, Adorno became a public figure, not simply through his books and essays but also through his appearances in radio and newspapers. In talks, interviews, and round-table discussions broadcast on Hessen Radio, South-West Radio, and Radio Bremen, Adorno discussed topics as diverse as \"The Administered World\" (September 1950), \"What is the Meaning of 'Working Through the Past?\"' (February 1960), and \"The Teaching Profession and its Taboos\" (August 1965). Additionally, he frequently wrote for \"Frankfurter Allgemeine\", \"Frankfurter Rundschau\", and the weekly \"Die Zeit\".\nAt the invitation of Wolfgang Steinecke, Adorno took part in the Darmstadt Summer Courses for New Music in Kranichstein from 1951 to 1958. Yet conflicts between the so-called Darmstadt school, which included composers like Pierre Boulez, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Luigi Nono, Bruno Maderna, Karel Goeyvaerts, Luciano Berio, and Gottfried Michael Koenig, soon arose, receiving explicit expression in Adorno's 1954 lecture, \"The Aging of the New Music\", where he argued that atonality's freedom was being restricted to serialism in much the same way as it was once restricted by twelve-tone technique. With his friend Eduard Steuermann, Adorno feared that music was being sacrificed to stubborn rationalization. During this time, Adorno not only produced a significant series of notes on Beethoven (which was never completed and only published posthumously) but also published \"Mahler: A Musical Physiognomy\" in 1960. In his 1961 return to Kranichstein, Adorno called for what he termed a \"musique informelle\", which would possess the ability \"really and truly to be what it is, without the ideological pretense of being something else. Or rather, to admit frankly the fact of non-identity and to follow through its logic to the end.\"\nPost-war German culture.\nAt the same time Adorno struck up relationships with contemporary German-language poets such as Paul Celan and Ingeborg Bachmann. Adorno's 1949 dictum\u2014\"To write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric\"\u2014posed the question of what German culture could mean after Auschwitz; his own continual revision of this dictum\u2014in \"Negative Dialectics\", for example, he wrote that \"Perennial suffering has as much right to expression as a tortured man has to scream\"; while in \"Commitment\", he wrote in 1962 that the dictum \"expresses in negative form the impulse which inspires committed literature\"\u2014was part of post-war Germany's struggle with history and culture. Adorno additionally befriended the writer and poet Hans Magnus Enzensberger as well as the film-maker Alexander Kluge.\nIn 1963, Adorno was elected to the post of chairman of the German Sociological Society, where he presided over two important conferences: in 1964, on \"Max Weber and Sociology\" and, in 1968, on \"Late Capitalism or Industrial Society\". A debate launched in 1961 by Adorno and Karl Popper, later published as the \"Positivist Dispute in German Sociology\", arose out of disagreements at the 1959 14th German Sociology Conference in Berlin.\nAdorno's critique of the dominant climate of post-war Germany was also directed against the pathos that had grown up around Heideggerianism, as practiced by writers like Karl Jaspers and Otto Friedrich Bollnow, and which had subsequently seeped into public discourse. His 1964 publication of \"The Jargon of Authenticity\" took aim at the halo such writers had attached to words like \"angst\", \"decision\", and \"leap\". After seven years of work, Adorno completed \"Negative Dialectics\" in 1966, after which, during the summer semester of 1967 and the winter semester of 1967\u201368, he offered regular philosophy seminars to discuss the book chapter by chapter. Among the students at these seminars were the Americans Angela Davis and Irving Wohlfarth. One objection, which would soon take on ever greater importance, was that critical thought must adopt the standpoint of the oppressed, to which Adorno replied that negative dialectics was concerned \"with the dissolution of standpoint thinking itself.\"\nConfrontations with students.\nStudent protests of 1968 took place in West Germany during the same period as the publication of \"Negative Dialectics\"'. Trends in the media, an educational crisis in the universities, the Shah of Iran's 1967 state visit, German support for the war in Vietnam, and the emergency laws combined to create a highly unstable situation. Like many of his students, Adorno too opposed the emergency laws, as well as the war in Vietnam, which, he said, proved the continued existence of the \"world of torture that had begun in Auschwitz\". The situation only deteriorated with the police shooting of Benno Ohnesorg at a protest against the Shah's visit. This death, as well as the subsequent acquittal of the responsible officer, were both commented upon in Adorno's lectures. As politicization increased, rifts developed within both the Institute's relationship with its students as well as within the Institute itself. Soon, Adorno himself would become an object of the students' ire. At the invitation of P\u00e9ter Szondi, Adorno was invited to the Free University of Berlin to give a lecture on Goethe's \"Iphigenie in Tauris\". After a group of students marched to the lectern, unfurling a banner that read \"Berlin's left-wing fascists greet Teddy the Classicist\", a number of those present left the lecture in protest after Adorno refused to abandon his talk in favor of discussing his attitude on the current political situation. Adorno shortly thereafter participated in a meeting with the Berlin Sozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund (SDS) and discussed \"Student Unrest\" with Szondi on West German Radio. However, as 1968 progressed, Adorno became increasingly critical of the disruptions students experienced in university life. His isolation was only compounded by articles published in the magazine \"alternative\", which, following the lead of Hannah Arendt's articles in \"Merkur\", claimed Adorno had subjected Benjamin to pressure during his years of exile in Berlin and compiled Benjamin's \"Writings\" and \"Letters\" with a great deal of bias. In response, Benjamin's longtime friend Gershom Scholem, wrote to the editor of \"Merkur\" to express his disapproval of the \"in part, shameful, not to say disgraceful\" remarks by Arendt.\nRelations between students and the West German state continued to deteriorate. In spring 1968, a prominent SDS spokesman, Rudi Dutschke, was gunned down in the streets; in response, massive demonstrations took place, directed in particular against the Springer Press, which had led a campaign to vilify the students. An open appeal published in \"Die Zeit\", signed by Adorno, called for an inquiry into the social reasons that gave rise to this assassination attempt as well as an investigation into the Springer Press' manipulation of public opinion. At the same time, however, Adorno protested against disruptions of his own lectures and refused to express his solidarity with their political goals, maintaining instead his autonomy as a theoretician. Adorno rejected the so-called unity of theory and praxis advocated by the students and argued that the students' actions were premised upon a mistaken analysis of the situation. The building of barricades, he wrote to Marcuse, is \"ridiculous against those who administer the bomb.\" Adorno would refer to the radical students as \"stormtroopers (Sturmabteilung) in jeans.\"\nIn September 1968, Adorno went to Vienna for the publication of \"Alban Berg: Master of the Smallest Link\". Upon his return to Frankfurt, events prevented his concentrating upon the book on aesthetics he wished to write: \"Valid student claims and dubious actions\", he wrote to Marcuse, \"are all so mixed up together that all productive work and even sensible thought are scarcely possible any more.\" After striking students threatened to strip the Institute's sociology seminar rooms of their furnishings and equipment, the police were brought in to close the building.\nLater years.\nAdorno began writing an introduction to a collection of poetry by Rudolf Borchardt, which was connected with a talk entitled \"Charmed Language\", delivered in Z\u00fcrich, followed by a talk on aesthetics in Paris where he met Beckett again. Beginning in October 1966, Adorno took up work on \"Aesthetic Theory\". In June 1969, he completed \"Catchwords: Critical Models\". During the winter semester of 1968\u201369 Adorno was on sabbatical leave from the university and thus able to dedicate himself to the completion of his book of aesthetics.\nFor the summer semester, Adorno planned a lecture course entitled \"An Introduction to Dialectical Thinking\", as well as a seminar on the dialectics of subject and object. But at the first lecture, Adorno's attempt to open up the lecture and invite questions whenever they arose degenerated into a disruption from which he quickly fled. After a student wrote on the blackboard, \"If Adorno is left in peace, capitalism will never cease\", three women students approached the lectern, bared their breasts and scattered flower petals over his head. Yet, Adorno continued to resist blanket condemnations of the protest movement, which would have only strengthened the conservative thesis according to which political irrationalism was the result of Adorno's teaching. After further disruptions to his lectures, Adorno cancelled the lectures for the rest of the seminar, continuing only with his philosophy seminar. In the summer of 1969, weary from these activities, Adorno returned once again to Zermatt, Switzerland, at the foot of Matterhorn to restore his strength. On 6 August, he died of a heart attack, during a vacation in Visp.\nIntellectual influences.\nLike most theorists of the Frankfurt School, Adorno was influenced by the works of Hegel, Marx, and Freud. Their major theories fascinated many left-wing intellectuals in the first half of the 20th century. Lorenz J\u00e4ger speaks critically of Adorno's \"Achilles' heel\" in his political biography: that Adorno placed \"almost unlimited trust in finished teachings, in Marxism, psychoanalysis, and the teachings of the Second Viennese School.\"\nHegel.\nAdorno's adoption of Hegelian philosophy can be traced back to his inaugural lecture in 1931, in which he postulated, \"only dialectically does philosophical interpretation seem possible to me\" (\"Gesammelte Schriften\" 1: 338). Hegel rejected the idea of separating methods and content, because thinking is always thinking of something; dialectics for him is \"the comprehended movement of the object itself.\" Like Gerhard Schweppenh\u00e4user, Adorno adopted this claim as his own, and based his thinking on one of the Hegelian basic categories, determinate negation, according to which something is not abstractly negated and dissolved into zero, but is preserved in a new, richer concept through its opposite.\nAdorno understood his \"Three Studies of Hegel\" as \"preparation of a changed definition of dialectics\" and that they stop \"where the start should be\" (\"Gesammelte Schriften\" 5: 249 f.). Adorno dedicated himself to this task in one of his later major works, the \"Negative Dialectics\" (1966). The title expresses \"tradition and rebellion in equal measure.\" Drawing from Hegelian reason's speculative dialectic, Adorno developed his own \"negative\" dialectic of the \"non-identical\".\nKarl Marx.\nMarx's \"Critique of Political Economy\" clearly shaped Adorno's thinking. As described by J\u00fcrgen Habermas, Marxist critique is, for Adorno, a \"silent orthodoxy, whose categories [are revealed] in Adorno's cultural critique, although their influence is not explicitly named.\" Marx's influence on Adorno first came by way of Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs's \"History and Class Consciousness\" (\"Geschichte und Klassenbewu\u00dftsein\"). From this text, Adorno took the Marxist categories of commodity fetishism and reification. These are closely related to Adorno's concept of trade, which stands in the center of his philosophy, not exclusively restricted to economic theory. Adorno's \"exchange society\" (), with its \"insatiable and destructive appetite for expansion\", is easily decoded as a description of capitalism. Furthermore, the Marxist concept of ideology is central for Adorno.\nClass theory, which appears less frequently in Adorno's work, also has its origins in Marxist thinking. Adorno made explicit reference to class in two of his texts: the first, the subchapter \"Classes and Strata\" (\"Klassen und Schichten\"), from his \"Introduction to the Sociology of Music\"; the second, an unpublished 1942 essay, \"Reflections on Class Theory\", published postmortem in his \"Collected Works\".\nSigmund Freud.\nPsychoanalysis is a constitutive element of critical theory. Adorno read Sigmund Freud's work early on, although, unlike Horkheimer, he never underwent analysis. He first read Freud while working on his initial (withdrawn) habilitation thesis, \"The Concept of the Unconscious in the Transcendental Theory of Mind\" (1927). In it Adorno argued that \"the healing of all neuroses is synonymous with the complete understanding of the meaning of their symptoms by the patient\". In his essay \"On the Relationship between Sociology and Psychology\" (1955), he justified the need to \"supplement the theory of society with psychology, especially analytically oriented social psychology\" in the face of fascism. Adorno emphasized the necessity of researching prevailing psychological drives in order to explain the cohesion of a repressive society acting against fundamental human interests.\nAdorno always remained a supporter and defender of Freudian orthodox doctrine, \"psychoanalysis in its strict form\". From this position, he attacked Erich Fromm and later Karen Horney because of their revisionism. He expressed reservations about sociologized psychoanalysis as well as about its reduction to a therapeutic procedure.\nPhilosophy.\nAdorno's work sets out from a central insight he shares with all early 20th century avant-garde art: the recognition of what is primitive in ourselves and the world itself. Neither Picasso's fascination with African sculpture nor Mondrian's reduction of painting to its most elementary component\u2014the line\u2014is comprehensible outside this concern with primitivism, which Adorno shared with the century's most radical art. At that time, the Western world, beset by world-wars, colonialist consolidation, and accelerating commodification, sank into the very barbarism civilization had prided itself in overcoming. According to Adorno, society's self-preservation had become indistinguishable from socially sanctioned self-sacrifice: of \"primitive\" peoples, primitive aspects of the ego and those primitive, mimetic desires found in imitation and sympathy. Adorno's theory proceeds from an understanding of this primitive quality of reality that seeks to counteract whatever aims either to repress this primitive aspect or to further those systems of domination set in place by this return to barbarism. From this perspective, Adorno's writings on politics, philosophy, music, and literature are a lifelong critique of the ways in which each tries to justify self-mutilation as the necessary price of self-preservation. According to Adorno's translator Robert Hullot-Kentor, the central motive of Adorno's work thus consists in determining \"how life could be more than the struggle for self-preservation\". In this sense, the principle of self-preservation, Adorno writes in \"Negative Dialectics\", is nothing but \"the law of doom thus far obeyed by history.\" At its most basic, Adorno's thought is motivated by a fundamental critique of this law.\nAdorno was chiefly influenced by Max Weber's critique of disenchantment, Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs's Hegelian interpretation of Marxism, and Walter Benjamin's philosophy of history. Adorno, along with the other major Frankfurt School theorists, Max Horkheimer and Herbert Marcuse, argued that advanced capitalism had managed to contain or liquidate the forces that would bring about its collapse and that the revolutionary moment, when it would have been possible to transform it into socialism, had passed. As he put it at the beginning of his \"Negative Dialectics\" (1966), philosophy is still necessary because the time to realize it was missed. Adorno argued that capitalism had become more entrenched through its attack on the objective basis of revolutionary consciousness and through liquidation of the individualism that had been the basis of critical consciousness. Adorno, as well as Horkheimer, critiqued all forms of positivism as responsible for technocracy and disenchantment and sought to produce a theory that both rejected positivism and avoided reinstating traditional metaphysics. Adorno and Horkheimer have been criticized for over-applying the term \"positivism\", especially in their interpretations of Ludwig Wittgenstein and Karl Popper as positivists.\nMusic and the culture industry.\nAdorno criticized jazz and popular music, viewing it as part of the culture industry, that contributes to the present sustainability of capitalism by rendering it \"aesthetically pleasing\" and \"agreeable\".\nIn his early essays for the Vienna-based journal \"Anbruch\", Adorno claimed that musical progress is proportional to the composer's ability to constructively deal with the possibilities and limitations contained within what he called the \"musical material\". For Adorno, twelve-tone serialism constitutes a decisive, historically developed method of composition. The objective validity of composition, according to him, rests with neither the composer's genius nor the work's conformity with prior standards, but with the way in which the work coherently expresses the dialectic of the material. In this sense, the contemporary absence of composers of the status of Bach or Beethoven is not the sign of musical regression; instead, new music is to be credited with laying bare aspects of the musical material previously repressed: The musical material's liberation from number, the harmonic series and tonal harmony. Thus, historical progress is achieved only by the composer who \"submits to the work and seemingly does not undertake anything active except to follow where it leads.\" Because historical experience and social relations are embedded within this musical material, it is to the analysis of such material that the critic must turn. In the face of this radical liberation of the musical material, Adorno came to criticize those who, like Stravinsky, withdrew from this freedom by taking recourse to forms of the past as well as those who turned twelve-tone composition into a technique that dictated the rules of composition.\nAdorno saw the culture industry as an arena in which critical tendencies or potentialities were eliminated. He argued that the culture industry, which produced and circulated cultural commodities through the mass media, manipulated the population. Popular culture was identified as a reason why people become passive; the easy pleasures available through consumption of popular culture made people docile and content, no matter how terrible their economic circumstances. \"Capitalist production so confines them, body and soul, that they fall helpless victims to what is offered them.\" The differences among cultural goods make them appear different, but they are in fact just variations on the same theme. He wrote that \"the same thing is offered to everybody by the standardized production of consumption goods\", but this is concealed under \"the manipulation of taste and the official culture's pretense of individualism\". By doing so, the culture industry appeals to every single consumer in a unique and personalized way, all while maintaining minimal costs and effort on their behalf. Consumers purchase the illusion that every commodity or product is tailored to the individual's personal preference, by incorporating subtle modifications or inexpensive \"add-ons\" in order to keep the consumer returning for new purchases, and therefore more revenue for the corporation system. Adorno conceptualized this phenomenon as \"pseudo-individualisation\" and the \"always-the-same\".\nAdorno's analysis allowed for a critique of mass culture from the left that balanced the critique of popular culture from the right. From both perspectives\u2014left and right\u2014the nature of cultural production was felt to be at the root of social and moral problems resulting from the consumption of culture. However, while the critique from the right emphasized moral degeneracy ascribed to sexual and racial influences within popular culture, Adorno located the problem, not with the content, but with the objective realities of the production of mass culture and its effects, for instance, as a form of reverse psychology. Thinkers influenced by Adorno believe that today's society has evolved in a direction foreseen by him, especially in regard to the past (Auschwitz), morals, or the Culture Industry. The latter has become a particularly productive, yet highly contested term in cultural studies. Many of Adorno's reflections on aesthetics and music have only just begun to be debated. A collection of essays on the subject, many of which had not previously been translated into English, has only recently been collected and published as \"Essays on Music\".\nAdorno's work in the years before his death was shaped by the idea of \"negative dialectics\", set out especially in his book of that title. A key notion in the work of the Frankfurt School since \"Dialectic of Enlightenment\" had been the idea of thought becoming an instrument of domination that subsumes all objects under the control of the (dominant) subject, especially through the notion of identity (in what his calls \"identity thinking\"), that is, of identifying as real in nature and society only that which harmonized or fit with dominant concepts, and regarding as unreal or non-existent everything that did not. Adorno's \"negative dialectics\" was an attempt to articulate a non-dominating thought that would recognize its limitations and accept the non-identity and reality of that which could not be subsumed under the subject's concepts. Indeed, Adorno sought to ground the critical bite of his sociological work in his critique of identity, which he took to be a reification in thought of the commodity form or exchange relation which always presumes a false identity between different things. The potential to criticize arises from the gap between the concept and the object, which can never go into the former without remainder. This gap, this non-identity in identity, was the secret to a critique of both material life and conceptual reflection.\nAdorno's reputation as a musicologist remains controversial. His sweeping criticisms of jazz and championing of the Second Viennese School in opposition to Stravinsky have caused him to fall out of favor. The distinguished American scholar Richard Taruskin declared Adorno to be \"preposterously over-rated.\" The eminent pianist and critic Charles Rosen saw Adorno's book \"The Philosophy of New Music\" as \"largely a fraudulent presentation, a work of polemic that pretends to be an objective study.\" Even a fellow Marxist such as the historian and jazz critic Eric Hobsbawm saw Adorno's writings as containing \"some of the stupidest pages ever written about jazz\". The British philosopher Roger Scruton saw Adorno as producing \"reams of turgid nonsense devoted to showing that the American people are just as alienated as Marxism requires them to be, and that their cheerful life-affirming music is a 'fetishized' commodity, expressive of their deep spiritual enslavement to the capitalist machine.\" Irritation with Adorno's tunnel vision started even while he was alive. He may have championed Schoenberg, but the composer notably failed to return the compliment: \"I have never been able to bear the fellow [...] It is disgusting, by the way, how he treats Stravinsky.\" Another composer, Luciano Berio said, in interview, \"It's not easy to completely refute anything that Adorno writes \u2013 he was, after all, one of the most acute, and also one of the most negative intellects to excavate the creativity of the past 150 years... He forgets that one of the most cunning and interesting aspects of consumer music, the mass media, and indeed of capitalism itself, is their fluidity, their unending capacity for adaptation and assimilation.\"\nOn the other hand, the scholar Slavoj \u017di\u017eek has written a foreword to Adorno's \"In Search of Wagner\", in which \u017di\u017eek attributes an \"emancipatory impulse\" to the same book\u2014although \u017di\u017eek also suggests that fidelity to this impulse demands \"a betrayal of the explicit theses of Adorno's Wagner study\".\nIn a 2014 \"New Yorker\" article, music critic Alex Ross discussed the continued relevance of Theodor Adorno's work in the digital age, stating: \"The pop hegemony is all but complete, its superstars dominating the media and wielding the economic might of tycoons ... Culture appears more monolithic than ever, with a few gigantic corporations\u2014Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon\u2014presiding over unprecedented monopolies.\"\nAdorno's critique of commercial media capitalism has continued to influence academic discussions. Scholars often reference his work to explore how Western entertainment industries may contribute to the reinforcement of global capitalism and Western cultural dominance. This perspective is reflected in studies that examine the role of transnational media corporations in shaping cultural production. For example, in The US Empire's Culture Industry, Tanner Mirrlees explores how Western commercial entertainment is often maintained by large transnational media corporations, rather than emerging organically from local cultural traditions.\nThe five components of recognition.\nAdorno states that a start to understand the recognition in respect of any particular song hit may be made by drafting a scheme which divides the experience of recognition into its different components. All the factors people enumerate are interwoven to a degree that would be impossible to separate from one another in reality. Adorno's scheme is directed towards the different objective elements involved in the experience of recognition:\nMarxist criticisms.\nAdorno posits social totality as an automatic system. According to Horst M\u00fcller's \"Kritik der kritischen Theorie\" (\"Critique of Critical Theory\"), this assumption is consistent with Adorno's idea of society as a self-regulating system, from which one must escape (but from which nobody \"can\" escape). For him it was existent, but inhuman. M\u00fcller argues against the existence of such a system and claims that critical theory provides no practical solution for societal change. He concludes that J\u00fcrgen Habermas, in particular, and the Frankfurt School in general, misconstrue Marx.\nStandardization.\nThe phenomenon of standardization is \"a concept used to characterize the formulaic products of capitalist-driven mass media and mass culture that appeal to the lowest common denominator in pursuit of maximum profit\". According to Adorno we inhabit a media culture driven society which has product consumption as one of its main characteristics. Mass media is employed to deliver messages about products and services to consumers in order to convince these individuals to purchase the commodity they are advertising. Standardization consists of the production of large amounts of commodities to then pursue consumers in order to gain the maximum profit possible.\nThey do this by individualizing products to give the illusion to consumers that they are in fact purchasing a product or service that was specifically designed for them. Adorno highlights the issues created with the construction of popular music, where different samples of music used in the creation of today's chart-topping songs are put together in order to create, re-create, and modify numerous tracks by using the same variety of samples from one song to another. He makes a distinction between \"Apologetic music\" and \"Critical music\". Apologetic music is defined as the highly produced and promoted music of the \"pop music\" industry: music that is composed of variable parts and interchanged to create several different songs. \"The social and psychological functions of popular music [are that it] acts like a social cement\" \"to keep people obedient and subservient to the status quo of existing power structures.\"\nSerious music, according to Adorno, achieves excellence when its whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The example he gives is that of Beethoven's symphonies: \"[his] greatness shows itself in the complete subordination of the accidentally private melodic elements to the form as a whole.\"\nStandardization not only refers to the products of the culture industry but to the consumers as well. Many times every day consumers are bombarded by media advertising. Consumers are pushed and shoved into consuming products and services presented to them by a media system that takes advantage of musical hooks mass produced via electronic media. The masses have become conditioned by the culture industry, which makes the impact of standardization far more widespread. Not recognizing the impact of social media and commercial advertising, the individual is caught in a situation where conformity is the norm: \"During consumption the masses become characterized by the commodities which they use and exchange among themselves.\"\nTony Waters and David Philhour have tested Adorno's ideas and used musical intros from pop songs, and asked students in the United States, Germany, and Thailand what they recognize. They found that indeed, as Adorno hypothesized, the song intro recognition has spread around the world for some specific commercial pop songs. But they also demonstrate that there are still national differences in recognition.\nAdorno's responses to his critics.\nAs a pioneer of a self-reflexive sociology who prefigured Bourdieu's ability to factor in the effect of reflection on the societal object, Adorno realized that some criticism (including deliberate disruption of his classes in the 1960s) could never be answered in a dialogue between equals if, as he seems to have believed, what the naive ethnographer or sociologist thinks of a human essence is always changing over time.\nAdorno's sociological methods.\nAdorno believed that the language the sociologist uses, like the language of the ordinary person, is a political construct in large measure that uses, often unreflectingly, concepts installed by dominant classes and social structures. He felt that those at the top of the Institute needed to be the source primarily of theories for evaluation and empirical testing, as well as people who would process the \"facts\" discovered ... including revising theories that were found to be false. For example, in an essay published in Germany on Adorno's return from the US, and reprinted in the \"Critical Models\" essays collection, Adorno praised the egalitarianism and openness of US society based on his sojourn in New York and the Los Angeles area between 1935 and 1955: \"Characteristic for the life in America [...] is a moment of peacefulness, kindness and generosity\".\nOne example of the clash of intellectual culture and Adorno's methods can be found in Paul Lazarsfeld, the American sociologist for whom Adorno worked in the late 1930s after fleeing Hitler. As Rolf Wiggershaus recounts in \"The Frankfurt School, Its History, Theories and Political Significance\" (MIT 1995), Lazarsfeld was the director of a project, funded and inspired by David Sarnoff (the head of RCA), to discover both the sort of music that listeners of radio liked and ways to improve their \"taste\", so that RCA could profitably air more classical music. Lazarsfeld, however, had trouble both with the prose style of the work Adorno handed in and what Lazarsfeld thought was Adorno's \"lack of discipline in ... presentation\".\nAdorno himself provided the following personal anecdote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;What I mean by reified consciousness, I can illustrate\u2014without elaborate philosophical contemplation\u2014most simply with an American experience. Among the frequently changing colleagues which the Princeton Project provided me with, was a young lady. After a few days, she had gained confidence in me, and asked most kindly: \"Dr Adorno, would you mind a personal question?\". I said, \"It depends on the question, but just go ahead\", and she went on: \"Please tell me: are you an extrovert or an introvert?\" It was as if she, as a living being, already thought according to the model of multi-choice questions in questionnaires.\nAdorno translated into English.\nWhile even German readers can find Adorno's work difficult to understand, an additional problem for English readers is that his German idiom is particularly difficult to translate into English. A similar difficulty of translation is true of Hegel, Heidegger, and a number of other German philosophers and poets. As a result, some early translators tended toward over-literalness. In recent years, Edmund Jephcott and Stanford University Press have published new translations of some of Adorno's lectures and books, including \"Introduction to Sociology\", \"Problems of Moral Philosophy\", his transcribed lectures on Kant's \"Critique of Pure Reason\" and Aristotle's \"Metaphysics\", and a new translation of the \"Dialectic of Enlightenment\". Professor Henry Pickford, of the University of Colorado at Boulder, has translated many of Adorno's works such as \"The Meaning of Working Through the Past\". A new translation has also appeared of \"Aesthetic Theory\" and the \"Philosophy of New Music\" by Robert Hullot-Kentor, from the University of Minnesota Press. Hullot-Kentor is also currently working on a new translation of \"Negative Dialectics\". Adorno's correspondence with Alban Berg, \"Towards a Theory of Musical Reproduction\", and the letters to Adorno's parents, have been translated by Wieland Hoban and published by Polity Press. These fresh translations are slightly less literal in their rendering of German sentences and words, and are more accessible to English readers. The Group Experiment, which had been unavailable to English readers, is now available in an accessible translation by Jeffrey K. Olick and Andrew J. Perrin on Harvard University Press, along with introductory material explaining its relation to the rest of Adorno's work and 20th-century public opinion research.\nWorks.\nBooks.\nPosthumously published\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Many thermophiles are archaea, though some of them are bacteria and fungi. Thermophilic eubacteria are suggested to have been among the earliest bacteria.\nThermophiles are found in geothermally heated regions of the Earth, such as hot springs like those in Yellowstone National Park and deep sea hydrothermal vents, as well as decaying plant matter, such as peat bogs and compost. They can live at high temperatures, whereas other bacteria or archaea would be damaged and sometimes killed if exposed to the same temperatures.\nThe enzymes in thermophiles function at high temperatures. Some of these enzymes are used in molecular biology, for example the \"Taq\" polymerase used in PCR. \"Thermophile\" is derived from \"heat\", and \"love\".\nComparative surveys suggest that thermophile diversity is principally driven by pH, not temperature.\nClassification.\nThermophiles can be classified in various ways. One classification sorts these organisms according to their optimal growth temperatures:\nIn a related classification, thermophiles are sorted as follows:\nMany hyperthermophilic Archaea require elemental sulfur for growth. Some are anaerobes that use the sulfur instead of oxygen as an electron acceptor during anaerobic cellular respiration. Some are lithotrophs that oxidize sulphur to create sulfuric acid as an energy source, thus requiring the microorganism to be adapted to very low pH (i.e., it is an acidophile as well as thermophile). These organisms are inhabitants of hot, sulfur-rich environments usually associated with volcanism, such as hot springs, geysers, and fumaroles. In these places, especially in Yellowstone National Park, zonation of microorganisms according to their temperature optima occurs. These organisms are often colored, due to the presence of photosynthetic pigments.\nThermophile versus mesophile.\nThermophiles can be discriminated from mesophiles from genomic features. For example, the GC-content levels in the coding regions of some signature genes were consistently identified as correlated with the temperature range condition when the association analysis was applied to mesophilic and thermophilic organisms regardless of their phylogeny, oxygen requirement, salinity, or habitat conditions.\nFungal thermophiles.\nFungi are the only group of organisms in the Eukaryota domain that can survive at temperature ranges of 50\u201360\u00a0\u00b0C. Thermophilic fungi have been reported from a number of habitats, with most of them belonging to the fungal order Sordariales. Thermophilic fungi have great biotechnological potential due to their ability to produce industrial-relevant thermostable enzymes, in particular for the degradation of plant biomass.\nGene transfer and genetic exchange.\n\"Sulfolobus solfataricus\" and \"Sulfolobus acidocaldarius\" are hyperthermophilic Archaea. When these organisms are exposed to the DNA damaging agents UV irradiation, bleomycin or mitomycin C, species-specific cellular aggregation is induced. In \"S. acidocaldarius\", UV-induced cellular aggregation mediates chromosomal marker exchange with high frequency. Recombination rates exceed those of uninduced cultures by up to three orders of magnitude. Frols et al. and Ajon et al.(2011) hypothesized that cellular aggregation enhances species-specific DNA transfer between \"Sulfolobus\" cells in order to provide increased repair of damaged DNA by means of homologous recombination. Van Wolferen et al., in discussing DNA exchange in the hyperthermophiles under extreme conditions, noted that DNA exchange likely plays a role in repair of DNA via homologous recombination. They suggested that this process is crucial under DNA damaging conditions such as high temperature. Also it has been suggested that DNA transfer in \"Sulfolobus\" may be a primitive form of sexual interaction similar to the more well-studied bacterial transformation systems that are associated with species-specific DNA transfer between cells leading to homologous recombinational repair of DNA damage.\nIn science.\n\"Thermus aquaticus\" is historically important. Its discovery pushed forward the maximum temperature in which it was believed any organism could grow, and its heat-resistant DNA polymerase enabled it to develop an efficient way to multiply DNA quickly without the enzyme being denatured, a key step in the amelioration of PCR tests.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
