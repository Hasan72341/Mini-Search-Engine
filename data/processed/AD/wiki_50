{"id": "36973", "revid": "49905838", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36973", "title": "Pashtuns", "text": "Iranic ethnic group\nPashtuns, also known as Pakhtuns, Pukhtoons, or Pathans, are a nomadic, pastoral Iranic ethnic group primarily residing in southern and eastern Afghanistan and northwestern Pakistan. They were historically referred to as Afghans until 1923, after the term's meaning had become a demonym for all citizens of Afghanistan, regardless of their ethnic group, creating an Afghan national identity.\nThe Pashtuns speak the Pashto language, which belongs to the Eastern Iranian branch of the Iranian language family, the Wanetsi language, mainly among Pashtuns of the Tareen tribe, and Ormuri among non-Pashtun Ormur people and Wazir Pashtuns. Additionally, Dari serves as the second language of Pashtuns in Afghanistan, while those in Pakistan speak Urdu and English. In India, the majority of those of Pashtun descent have lost the ability to speak Pashto and instead speak Hindi and other regional languages, while those in Iran primarily speak Southern Pashto, and Persian as a second language.\nPashtuns form the world's largest tribal society, comprising from 60\u201370 million people, and between 350\u2013400 tribes with further having more sub-tribes, as well as a variety of origin theories. In 2021, Shahid Javed Burki estimated the total Pashtun population to be situated between 60 and 70 million, with 15 million in Afghanistan. Others who accept the 15 million figure include British academic Tim Willasey-Wilsey as well as Abubakar Siddique, a journalist specializing in Afghan affairs. This figure is disputed due to the lack of an official census in Afghanistan since 1979 due to continuing conflicts there.\nThey are the largest ethnic group in Afghanistan and the second-largest ethnic group in Pakistan, constituting around 42\u201347% of the total Afghan population and around 15.4% of the total Pakistani population In India, significant and historical communities of the Pashtun diaspora exist in the northern region of Rohilkhand, as well as in major Indian cities such as Delhi and Mumbai.\nGeographic distribution.\nAfghanistan and Pakistan.\nPashtuns are spread over a wide geographic area, south of the Amu river and west of the Indus River. They can be found all over Afghanistan and Pakistan. Big cities with a Pashtun majority include Jalalabad, Kandahar, Bannu, Dera Ismail Khan, Khost, Kohat, Lashkar Gah, Mardan, Ghazni, Mingora, Peshawar, Quetta, among others. Pashtuns also live in Abbottabad, Farah, Herat, Islamabad, Kabul, Karachi, Kunduz, Lahore, Mazar-i-Sharif, Mianwali, and Attock.\nThe city of Karachi, the financial capital of Pakistan, is home to the world's largest urban community of Pashtuns, larger than those of Kabul and Peshawar. Likewise, Islamabad, the country's political capital, also serves as the major urban center of Pashtuns. More than 20% of the city's population belongs to the Pashto-speaking community.\nIndia.\nPashtuns in India often identify as \"Pathans\" (the Hindustani word for Pashtun), and are referred to this way by other ethnic groups of the subcontinent. Some Indians claim descent from Pashtun soldiers who settled in India by marrying local women during the Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent.\nMany Pathans chose to live in the Republic of India after the partition of India. Khan Mohammad Atif, a professor at the University of Lucknow, estimates that \"The population of Pathans in India is twice their population in Afghanistan\".\nHistorically, Pashtuns settled in various cities of India before and during the British Raj in colonial India. These include Bombay (now called Mumbai), Farrukhabad, Delhi, Calcutta, Saharanpur, Rohilkhand, Jaipur, and Bangalore. The settlers are descended from both Pashtuns of present-day Pakistan and Afghanistan (British India before 1947). In some regions in India, they are sometimes referred to as \"Kabuliwala\".\nIn India significant Pashtun diaspora communities exist. While speakers of Pashto in the country number only 21,677 as of 2011, estimates of the ethnic or ancestral Pashtun population in India range from 3,200,000 to 11,482,000, to as high as double their population in Afghanistan (approximately 30 million).\nThe Rohilkhand region of Uttar Pradesh is named after the Rohilla community of Pashtun ancestry; the area came to be governed by the Royal House of Rampur, a Pashtunized Jat dynasty. They also live in the states of Maharashtra in central India and West Bengal in eastern India that each have a population of over a million with Pashtun ancestry; both Bombay and Calcutta were primary locations of Pashtun migrants from Afghanistan during the colonial era. There are also populations over 100,000 each in the cities of Jaipur in Rajasthan and Bangalore in Karnataka. Bombay (now called Mumbai) and Calcutta both have a Pashtun population of over 1 million, while Jaipur and Bangalore have an estimate of around 100,000. The Pashtuns in Bangalore include the Khan siblings Feroz, Sanjay and Akbar Khan, whose father settled in Bangalore from Ghazni.\nDuring the 19th century, when the British were recruiting peasants from British India as indentured servants to work in the Caribbean, South Africa and other places, Rohillas were sent to Trinidad, Surinam, Guyana, and Fiji, to work in the sugarcane fields and perform manual labour. Many stayed and formed communities of their own. Some of them assimilated with the other South Asian Muslim nationalities to form a common Indian Muslim community in tandem with the larger Indian community, losing their distinctive heritage. Some Pashtuns travelled as far as Australia during the same era.\nToday, the Pashtuns are a collection of diversely scattered communities present across the length and breadth of India, with the largest populations principally settled in the plains of northern and central India. Following the partition of India in 1947, many of them migrated to Pakistan. The majority of Indian Pashtuns are Urdu-speaking communities, who have assimilated into the local society over the course of generations. Pashtuns have influenced and contributed to various fields in India, particularly politics, the entertainment industry and sports.\nIran.\nPashtuns are also found in smaller numbers in the eastern and northern parts of Iran. Records as early as the mid-1600s report Durrani Pashtuns living in the Khorasan province of Safavid Iran. After the short reign of the Ghilji Pashtuns in Iran, Nader Shah defeated the last independent Ghilji ruler of Kandahar, Hussain Hotak. In order to secure Durrani control in southern Afghanistan, Nader Shah deported Hussain Hotak and large numbers of the Ghilji Pashtuns to the Mazandaran province in northern Iran. The remnants of this once sizeable exiled community, although assimilated, continue to claim Pashtun descent. During the early 18th century, in the course of a very few years, the number of Durrani Pashtuns in Iranian Khorasan, greatly increased. Later the region became part of the Durrani Empire itself. The second Durrani king of Afghanistan, Timur Shah Durrani was born in Mashhad. Contemporary to Durrani rule in the east, Azad Khan Afghan, an ethnic Ghilji Pashtun, formerly second in charge of Azerbaijan during Afsharid rule, gained power in the western regions of Iran and Azerbaijan for a short period. According to a sample survey in 1988, 75 per cent of all Afghan refugees in the southern part of the Iranian Khorasan province were Durrani Pashtuns.\nIn other regions.\nIndian and Pakistani Pashtuns have utilized the British/Commonwealth links of their respective countries, and modern communities have been established starting around the 1960s mainly in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia but also in other commonwealth countries (and the United States). Some Pashtuns have also settled in the Middle East, such as in the Arabian Peninsula. For example, about 300,000 Pashtuns migrated to the Persian Gulf countries between 1976 and 1981, representing 35% of Pakistani immigrants. The Pakistani and Afghan diaspora around the world includes Pashtuns.\nEtymology.\nAncient historical references: Pashtun.\nA tribe called Pakth\u0101s, one of the tribes that fought against Sudas in the Dasarajna, or \"Battle of the Ten Kings\", are mentioned in the seventh mandala of the Rigveda, a text of Vedic Sanskrit hymns dated between c. 1500 and 1200 BCE:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Together came the Pakthas (\u092a\u0915\u094d\u0925\u093e\u0938), the Bhalanas, the Alinas, the Sivas, the Visanins. Yet to the Trtsus came the \u0100rya's Comrade, through love of spoil and heroes' war, to lead them.\u2014\u200a\nHeinrich Zimmer connects them with a tribe mentioned by Herodotus (\"Pactyans\") in 430 BCE in the Histories:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Other Indians dwell near the town of Caspatyrus[\u039a\u03b1\u03c3\u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03cd\u03c1\u1ff3] and the Pactyic [\u03a0\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03c5\u03ca\u03ba\u1fc7] country, north of the rest of India; these live like the Bactrians; they are of all Indians the most warlike, and it is they who are sent for the gold; for in these parts all is desolate because of the sand.\u2014\u200a\nThese Pactyans lived on the eastern frontier of the Achaemenid Arachosia Satrapy as early as the 1st millennium BCE, present-day Afghanistan. Herodotus also mentions a tribe of known as Aparytai (\u1f08\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03cd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9). Thomas Holdich has linked them with the Afridi tribe:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Sattagydae, Gandarii, Dadicae, and Aparytae (\u1f08\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03cd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9) paid together a hundred and seventy talents; this was the seventh province\u2014\u200a\nJoseph Marquart made the connection of the Pashtuns with names such as the Parsi\u0113tai (\u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03c3\u03b9\u1fc6\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9), Parsioi (\u03a0\u03ac\u03c1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9) that were cited by Ptolemy 150 CE:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"The northern regions of the country are inhabited\nby the Bolitai, the western regions by the Aristophyloi below whom live the Parsioi (\u03a0\u03ac\u03c1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9). The southern regions are inhabited by the Parsi\u0113tai (\u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03c3\u03b9\u1fc6\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9), the eastern regions by the Ambautai. The towns and villages lying in the country of the Paropanisadai are these: Parsiana Zarzaua/Barzaura Artoarta Baborana Kapisa niphanda\"\u2014\u200a\nStrabo, the Greek geographer, in the Geographica (written between 43 BC to 23 AD) makes mention of the Scythian tribe Pasiani (\u03a0\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03af), which has also been identified with Pashtuns given that Pashto is an Eastern-Iranian language, much like the Scythian languages:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Most of the Scythians...each separate tribe has its peculiar name. All, or the greatest part of them, are nomades. The best known tribes are those who deprived the Greeks of Bactriana, the Asii, Pasiani, Tochari, and Sacarauli, who came from the country on the other side of the Iaxartes (Syr Darya)\"\u2014\u200a\nThis is considered a different rendering of Ptolemy's Parsioi (\u03a0\u03ac\u03c1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9). Johnny Cheung, reflecting on Ptolemy's \"Parsioi (\u03a0\u03ac\u03c1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9)\" and Strabo's \"Pasiani\" (\u03a0\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03af) states: \"Both forms show slight phonetic substitutions, viz. of \u03c5 for \u03b9, and the loss of r in Pasianoi is due to perseveration from the preceding Asianoi. They are therefore the most likely candidates as the (linguistic) ancestors of modern day Pashtuns.\"\nMiddle historical references: Afghan.\nIn the Middle Ages until the advent of modern Afghanistan in the 18th century, the Pashtuns were often referred to as \"Afghans\".\nThe etymological view supported by numerous noted scholars is that the name \"Afghan\" evidently derives from Sanskrit \"A\u015bvakan\", or the Assakenoi of Arrian, which was the name used for ancient inhabitants of the Hindu Kush. \"A\u015bvakan\" literally means \"horsemen\", \"horse breeders\", or \"cavalrymen\" (from \"a\u015bva\" or \"aspa\", the Sanskrit and Avestan words for \"horse\"). This view was propounded by scholars like Christian Lassen, J. W. McCrindle, M. V. de Saint Martin, and \u00c9. Reclus,\nThe earliest mention of the name \"Afghan\" (\"Abg\u00e2n\") is by Shapur I of the Sassanid Empire during the 3rd century CE, In the 4th century the word \"Afghans/Afghana\" (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf) as a reference to a particular people is mentioned in the Bactrian documents found in Northern Afghanistan.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"To Ormuzd Bunukan, from Bredag Watanan ... greetings and homage from ... ), the ( sotang ( ? ) of Parpaz ( under ) [ the glorious ) yabghu of Hephthal, the chief of the Afghans, ' the judge of Tukharistan and Gharchistan .

Moreover, they are in [War]nu(?) because of the Afghans, so [you should] impose a penalty on Nat Kharagan ... ...lord of Warnu with ... ... ...the Afghan... ... \"\u2014\u200a\nThe name Afghan is later recorded in the 6th century CE in the form of \"Avag\u0101\u1e47a\" [\u0905\u0935\u0917\u093e\u0923] by the Indian astronomer Var\u0101ha Mihira in his Brihat-samhita.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Var\u0101ha Mihira\u2014\u200a\nThe word Afghan also appeared in the 982 \u1e24ud\u016bd al-\u02bf\u0100lam, where a reference is made to a village, Saul, which was probably located near Gardez, Afghanistan.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Saul, a pleasant village on a mountain. In it live \"Afghans\"\". The same book also speaks of a king in Ninhar (Nangarhar), who had Muslim, \"Afghan\" and Hindu wives. In the 11th century, Afghans are mentioned in Al-Biruni's \"Tarikh-ul Hind\" (\"History of the Indus\"), which describes groups of rebellious Afghans in the tribal lands west of the Indus River in what is today Pakistan.\nAl-Utbi, the Ghaznavid chronicler, in his \"Tarikh-i Yamini\" recorded that many Afghans and Khiljis (possibly the modern Ghilji) enlisted in the army of Sabuktigin after Jayapala was defeated. Al-Utbi further stated that Afghans and Ghiljis made a part of Mahmud Ghaznavi's army and were sent on his expedition to Tocharistan, while on another occasion Mahmud Ghaznavi attacked and punished a group of opposing Afghans, as also corroborated by Abulfazl Beyhaqi. It is recorded that Afghans were also enrolled in the Ghurid Kingdom (1148\u20131215). By the beginning of the Khilji dynasty in 1290, Afghans have been well known in northern India.\nIbn Battuta, when visiting Afghanistan following the era of the Khilji dynasty, also wrote about the Afghans.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"We travelled on to Kabul, formerly a vast town, the site of which is now occupied by Afghans. They hold mountains and defiles and possess considerable strength, and are mostly highwaymen. Their principal mountain is called Kuh Sulayman. It is told that the prophet Sulayman [Solomon] ascended this mountain and having looked out over India, which was then covered with darkness, returned without entering it.\"\u2014\u200a\nFerishta, a 16th-century Muslim historian writing about the history of Muslim rule in the subcontinent, stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He [Khalid bin Abdullah son of Khalid bin Walid] retired, therefore, with his family, and a number of Arab retainers, into the Sulaiman Mountains, situated between Multan and Peshawar, where he took up his residence, and gave his daughter in marriage to one of the Afghan chiefs, who had become a proselyte to Mahomedism. From this marriage many children were born, among whom were two sons famous in history. The one Lodhi, the other Sur; who each, subsequently, became head of the tribes which to this day bear their name. I have read in the \"Mutla-ul-Anwar\", a work written by a respectable author, and which I procured at Burhanpur, a town of Khandesh in the Deccan, that the Afghans are Copts of the race of the Pharaohs; and that when the prophet Moses got the better of that infidel who was overwhelmed in the Red Sea, many of the Copts became converts to the Jewish faith; but others, stubborn and self-willed, refusing to embrace the true faith, leaving their country, came to India, and eventually settled in the Sulimany mountains, where they bore the name of Afghans.\nHistory and origins.\nThe ethnogenesis of the Pashtun ethnic group is unclear. There are many conflicting theories among historians and the Pashtuns themselves. Modern scholars believe that Pashtuns do not all share the same origin. The early ancestors of modern-day Pashtuns may have belonged to old Iranian tribes that spread throughout the eastern Iranian plateau. Historians have also come across references to various ancient Indo-Aryan tribes called \"Pakthas\" (\"Pactyans\") between the 2nd and the 1st millennium BC, although according to Richard N. Frye the identification of Pashtuns with the Pakhtas is a mere guess and not proven. And scholars such as Georg Morgenstierne propose the derivation of Pashto from Parsa or Parswana.\nMohan Lal stated in 1846 that \"the origin of the Afghans is so obscure, that no one, even among the oldest and most clever of the tribe, can give satisfactory information on this point.\" Others have suggested that a single origin of the Pashtuns is unlikely but rather they are a tribal confederation.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Vogelsang\u2014\u200a\nLinguistic origin.\nPashto is generally classified as an Eastern Iranian language. It shares features with the Munji language, which is the closest existing language to the extinct Bactrian, but also shares features with the Sogdian language, as well as Khwarezmian, Shughni, Sanglechi, and Khotanese Saka.\nIt is suggested by some that Pashto may have originated in the Badakhshan region and is connected to a Saka language akin to Khotanese. In fact major linguist Georg Morgenstierne has described Pashto as a Saka dialect and many others have observed the similarities between Pashto and other Saka languages as well, suggesting that the original Pashto speakers might have been a Saka group. Furthermore, Pashto and Ossetian, another Scythian-descending language, share cognates in their vocabulary which other Eastern Iranian languages lack Cheung suggests a common isogloss between Pashto and Ossetian which he explains by an undocumented Saka dialect being spoken close to reconstructed Old Pashto which was likely spoken north of the Oxus at that time. Others however have suggested a much older Iranic ancestor given the affinity to Old Avestan.\nDiverse origin.\nAccording to one school of thought, Pashtun are descended from a variety of ethnicities, including Persians, Greeks, Turks, Arabs, Bactrians, Dards, Scythians, Tartars, Huns (Hephthalites), Mongols, Moghals (Mughals), and anyone else who has crossed the region where these Pashtun live. Unexpectedly, this includes alleged ties of Israelite descent.\nSome Pashtun tribes claim descent from Arabs, including some claiming to be Sayyids.\nOne historical account connects the Pashtuns to a possible Ancient Egyptian past but this lacks supporting evidence.\nHenry Walter Bellew, who wrote extensively on Afghan culture, noted that some people claim that the Bangash Pashtuns are connected to Ismail Samani.\nGreek origin.\nAccording to Firasat et al. 2007, a proportion of Pashtuns may descend from Greeks, but they also suggest that Greek ancestry may also have come from Greek slaves brought by Xerxes I.\nThe Greek ancestry of the Pashtuns may also be traced on the basis of a homologous group. And Haplogroup J2 is from the Semitic population, and this haplogroup is found in 6.5% of Greeks and Pashtuns and 55.6% of the Israelite population.\nA number of genetic studies on \"Pashtuns\" have lately been undertaken by academics from various institutions and research institutes. The Greek heritage of Pakistani Pashtuns has been researched in. In this study, the \"Pashtuns\", \"Kalash\", and \"Burusho\" to be descended from Alexander's soldiers considered.\nHenry Walter Bellew (1834\u20131892) was of the view that the Pashtuns likely have mixed Greek and Indian Rajput roots.\nFollowing Alexander's brief occupation, the successor state of the Seleucid Empire expanded influence on the Pashtuns until 305\u00a0BCE when they gave up dominating power to the Indian Maurya Empire as part of an alliance treaty.\nSome groups from Peshawar and Kandahar believe to be descended from Greeks who arrived with Alexander the Great.\nHephthalite origin.\nAccording to some accounts the Ghilji tribe has been connected to the Khalaj people. Following al-Khwarizmi, Josef Markwart claimed the Khalaj to be remnants of the Hephthalite confederacy. The Hephthalites may have been Indo-Iranian, although the view that they were of Turkic Gaoju origin \"seems to be most prominent at present\". The Khalaj may originally have been Turkic-speaking and only federated with Iranian Pashto-speaking tribes in medieval times.\nHowever, according to linguist Sims-Williams, archaeological documents do not support the suggestion that the Khalaj were the successors of the Hephthalites, while according to historian V. Minorsky, the Khalaj were \"perhaps only politically associated with the Hephthalites.\"\nAccording to Georg Morgenstierne, the Durrani tribe who were known as the \"Abdali\" before the formation of the Durrani Empire 1747, might be connected to with the Hephthalites; Aydogdy Kurbanov endorses this view who proposes that after the collapse of the Hephthalite confederacy, Hephthalite likely assimilated into different local populations.\nAccording to The Cambridge History of Iran volume 3, Issue 1, the Ghilji tribe of Afghanistan are the descendants of Hephthalites.\nAnthropology and oral traditions.\nTheory of Pashtun descent from Israelites.\nSome anthropologists lend credence to the oral traditions of the Pashtun tribes themselves. For example, according to the \"Encyclopaedia of Islam\", the theory of Pashtun descent from Israelites is traced to Nimat Allah al-Harawi, who compiled a history for \"Khan-e-Jehan Lodhi\" in the reign of Mughal Emperor Jehangir in the 17th century. The 13th century Tabaqat-i Nasiri discusses the settlement of immigrant Bani Israel at the end of the 8th century CE in the Ghor region of Afghanistan, settlement attested by Jewish inscriptions in Ghor. Historian Andr\u00e9 Wink suggests that the story \"may contain a clue to the remarkable theory of the Jewish origin of some of the Afghan tribes which is persistently advocated in the Persian-Afghan chronicles.\" These references to Bani Israel agree with the commonly held view by Pashtuns that when the twelve tribes of Israel were dispersed, the tribe of Joseph, among other Hebrew tribes, settled in the Afghanistan region. This oral tradition is widespread among the Pashtun tribes. There have been many legends over the centuries of descent from the Ten Lost Tribes after groups converted to Christianity and Islam. Hence the tribal name Yusufzai in Pashto translates to the \"son of Joseph\". A similar story is told by many historians, including the 14th century Ibn Battuta and 16th century Ferishta. However, the similarity of names can also be traced to the presence of Arabic through Islam.\nThis theory of Pashtuns Jewish origin has been largely denied and is said that Its biblical claims are anecdotal, its historical documentation is inconsistent, its geographic claims are incoherent, and its linguistic assertions are implausible.\nOne conflicting issue in the belief that the Pashtuns descend from the Israelites is that the Ten Lost Tribes were exiled by the ruler of Assyria, while \"Maghzan-e-Afghani\" says they were permitted by the ruler to go east to Afghanistan. This inconsistency can be explained by the fact that Persia acquired the lands of the ancient Assyrian Empire when it conquered the Empire of the Medes and Chaldean Babylonia, which had conquered Assyria decades earlier. But no ancient author mentions such a transfer of Israelites further east, or no ancient extra-Biblical texts refer to the Ten Lost Tribes at all.\nSome Afghan historians have maintained that Pashtuns are linked to the ancient Israelites. Mohan Lal quoted Mountstuart Elphinstone who wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Mountstuart Elphinstone\u2014\u200a\nThis theory has been criticized for not being substantiated by historical evidence. Zaman Stanizai criticizes this theory:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"The 'mythified' misconception that the Pashtuns are the descendants of the lost tribes of Israel is a fabrication popularized in 14th-century India. A claim that is full of logical inconsistencies and historical incongruities, and stands in stark contrast to the conclusive evidence of the Indo-Iranian origin of Pashtuns supported by the incontrovertible DNA sequencing that the genome analysis revealed scientifically.\"\nAccording to genetic studies Pashtuns have a greater R1a1a*-M198 modal halogroup than Jews:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Our study demonstrates genetic similarities between Pathans from Afghanistan and Pakistan, both of which are characterized by the predominance of haplogroup R1a1a*-M198 (&gt;50%) and the sharing of the same modal haplotype...Although Greeks and Jews have been proposed as ancestors to Pathans, their genetic origin remains ambiguous...Overall, Ashkenazi Jews exhibit a frequency of 15.3% for haplogroup R1a1a-M198\"\u2014\u200a\nModern era.\nTheir modern past stretches back to the Delhi Sultanate (Khalji and Lodi dynasty), the Hotak dynasty and the Durrani Empire. The Hotak rulers rebelled against the Safavids and seized control over much of Persia from 1722 to 1729. This was followed by the conquests of Ahmad Shah Durrani who was a former high-ranking military commander under Nader Shah and founder of the Durrani Empire, which covered most of what is now Afghanistan, Pakistan, Kashmir, Indian Punjab, as well as the Kohistan and Khorasan provinces of Iran. After the decline of the Durrani dynasty in the first half of the 19th century under Shuja Shah Durrani, the Barakzai dynasty took control of the empire. Specifically, the Mohamedzais held Afghanistan's monarchy from around 1826 to the end of Zahir Shah's reign in 1973.\nDuring the so-called \"Great Game\" of the 19th century, rivalry between the British and Russian empires was useful to the Pashtuns of Afghanistan in resisting foreign control and retaining a degree of autonomy (see the Siege of Malakand). However, during the reign of Abdur Rahman Khan (1880\u20131901), Pashtun regions were politically divided by the Durand Line \u2013 areas that would become western Pakistan fell within British India as a result of the border.\nIn the 20th century, many politically active Pashtun leaders living under British rule of undivided India supported Indian independence, including Ashfaqulla Khan, Abdul Samad Khan Achakzai, Ajmal Khattak, Bacha Khan and his son Wali Khan (both members of the Khudai Khidmatgar), and were inspired by Mohandas Gandhi's non-violent method of resistance. Many Pashtuns also worked in the Muslim League to fight for an independent Pakistan through non violent resistance, including Yusuf Khattak and Abdur Rab Nishtar who was a close associate of Muhammad Ali Jinnah.\nThe Pashtuns of Afghanistan attained complete independence from British political intervention during the reign of Amanullah Khan, following the Third Anglo-Afghan War. By the 1950s a popular call for Pashtunistan began to be heard in Afghanistan and the new state of Pakistan. This led to bad relations between the two nations. The Afghan monarchy ended when President Daoud Khan seized control of Afghanistan from his cousin Zahir Shah in 1973 on a Pashtun Nationalist agenda, which opened doors for a proxy war by neighbours. In April 1978, Daoud Khan was assassinated along with his family and relatives in a bloody coup orchestrated by Hafizullah Amin. Afghan mujahideen commanders in exile in neighbouring Pakistan began recruiting for a guerrilla warfare against the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan \u2013 the Marxist government which was also dominated by Pashtun Khalqists who held Nationalist views including Hafizullah Amin, Nur Muhammad Taraki, General Mohammad Aslam Vatanjar, Shahnawaz Tanai, Mohammad Gulabzoy and many more. In 1979, the Soviet Union intervened in its southern neighbour Afghanistan in order to defeat a rising insurgency. The Afghan mujahideen were funded by the United States, Saudi Arabia, China and others, and included some Pashtun commanders such as Abdul Rasul Sayyaf, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, Jalaluddin Haqqani, Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi and Mohammad Yunus Khalis. In the meantime, millions of Pashtuns joined the Afghan diaspora in Pakistan and Iran, and from there tens of thousands proceeded to Europe, North America, Oceania and other parts of the world. The Afghan government and military would remain predominantly Pashtun until the fall of Mohammad Najibullah's Republic of Afghanistan in April 1992.\nMany high-ranking government officials in the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan were Pashtuns, including: Abdul Rahim Wardak, Abdul Salam Azimi, Anwar ul-Haq Ahady, Amirzai Sangin, Ghulam Farooq Wardak, Hamid Karzai, Mohammad Ishaq Aloko, Omar Zakhilwal, Sher Mohammad Karimi, Zalmay Rasoul, Yousef Pashtun. The list of current governors of Afghanistan also include large percentage of Pashtuns. Mullah Yaqoob serves as acting Defense Minister, Sirajuddin Haqqani as acting Interior Minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi as acting Foreign Minister, Gul Agha Ishakzai as acting Finance Minister, and Hasan Akhund as acting Prime Minister. A number of other ministers are also Pashtuns.\nThe Afghan royal family, which was represented by King Zahir Shah, are referred to Mohammadzais. Other prominent Pashtuns include the 17th-century poets Khushal Khan Khattak and Rahman Baba, and in contemporary era Afghan Astronaut Abdul Ahad Mohmand, former US Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad, and Ashraf Ghani among many others.\nMany Pashtuns of Pakistan and India have adopted non-Pashtun cultures, mainly by abandoning Pashto and using languages such as Urdu, Punjabi, and Hindko. These include Ghulam Mohammad (first Finance Minister, from 1947 to 1951, and third Governor-General of Pakistan, from 1951 to 1955), Ayub Khan, who was the second President of Pakistan, Zakir Husain who was the third President of India and Abdul Qadeer Khan, father of Pakistan's nuclear weapons program.\nMany more held high government posts, such as Asfandyar Wali Khan, Mahmood Khan Achakzai, Sirajul Haq, and Aftab Ahmad Sherpao, who are presidents of their respective political parties in Pakistan. Others became famous in sports (e.g., Imran Khan, Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi, Younis Khan, Shahid Afridi, Irfan Pathan, Jahangir Khan, Jansher Khan, Hashim Khan, Rashid Khan, Shaheen Afridi, Naseem Shah, Misbah Ul Haq, Mujeeb Ur Rahman and Mohammad Wasim) and literature (e.g., Ghani Khan, Hamza Shinwari, and Kabir Stori). Malala Yousafzai, who became the youngest Nobel Peace Prize recipient in 2014, is a Pakistani Pashtun. Pashtuns are considered to be well-integrated in the Pakistani society, and as per a 2009 Pew Research Center report 92% of the Pashtuns identified with their Pakistani identity before their ethnic Pashtun identity.\nMany of the Bollywood film stars in India have Pashtun ancestry; some of the most notable ones are Aamir Khan, Shahrukh Khan, Salman Khan, Feroz Khan, Madhubala, Kader Khan, Saif Ali Khan, Soha Ali Khan, Sara Ali Khan, and Zarine Khan. In addition, one of India's former presidents, Zakir Husain, belonged to the Afridi tribe. Mohammad Yunus, India's former ambassador to Algeria and advisor to Indira Gandhi, is of Pashtun origin and related to the legendary Bacha Khan.\nIn the late 1990s, Pashtuns were the primary ethnic group in the ruling regime i.e. Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (Taliban regime). The Northern Alliance that was fighting against the Taliban also included a number of Pashtuns. Among them were Abdullah Abdullah, Abdul Qadir and his brother Abdul Haq, Abdul Rasul Sayyaf, Asadullah Khalid, Hamid Karzai and Gul Agha Sherzai. The Taliban regime was ousted in late 2001 during the US-led War in Afghanistan and replaced by the Karzai administration. This was followed by the Ghani administration and the reconquest of Afghanistan by the Taliban (Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan).\nThe long wars in Afghanistan have led to Pashtuns gaining a reputation for being exceptional fighters. Some activists and intellectuals are trying to rebuild Pashtun intellectualism and its pre-war culture.\nGenetics.\nThe majority of Pashtuns from Afghanistan belong to R1a, with a frequency of 50\u201365%. Subclade R1a-Z2125 occurs at a frequency of 40%. This subclade is predominantly found in Tajiks, Turkmen, Uzbeks and in some populations in the Caucasus and Iran. Haplogroup G-M201 reaches 9% in Afghan Pashtuns and is the second most frequent haplogroup in Pashtuns from southern Afghanistan. Haplogroup L and Haplogroup J2 occurs at an overall frequency of 6%. According to a Mitochondrial DNA analysis of four ethnic groups of Afghanistan, the majority of mtDNA among Afghan Pashtuns belongs to West Eurasian lineages, and share a greater affinity with West Eurasian and Central Asian populations rather than to populations of South Asia or East Asia. The haplogroup analysis indicates the Pashtuns and Tajiks in Afghanistan share ancestral heritage. Among the studied ethnic groups, the Pashtuns have the greatest mtDNA diversity. The most frequent haplogroup among Pakistani Pashtuns is haplogroup R which is found at a rate of 28\u201350%. Haplogroup J2 was found in 9% to 24% depending on the study and Haplogroup E has been found at a frequency of 4% to 13%. Haplogroup L occurs at a rate of 8%. Certain Pakistani Pashtun groups exhibit high levels of R1b. Overall Pashtun groups are genetically diverse, and the Pashtun ethnic group is not a single genetic population. Different Pashtun groups exhibit different genetic backgrounds, resulting in considerable heterogeneity.\nY haplogroup and mtdna haplogroup samples were taken from Jadoon, Yousafzai, Sayyid, Gujar and Tanoli men living in Swabi District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan. Jadoon men have predominantly East Asian origin paternal ancestry with West Eurasian maternal ancestry and a lesser amount of South Asian maternal ancestry according to a Y and mtdna haplogroup test indicating local females marrying immigrant males during the medieval period. Y Haplogroup O3-M122 makes up the majority of Jadoon men, the same haplogroup carried by the majority (50\u201360%) of Han Chinese. 82.5% of Jadoon men carrying Q-MEH2 and O3-M122 which are both of East Asian origin. O3-M122 was absent in the Sayyid (Syed) population and appeared in low numbers among Tanolis, Gujars and Yousafzais. There appears to be founder affect in the O3-M122 among the Jadoon. 76.32% of Jadoon men carry O3-M122 while 0.75% of Tanolis, 0.81% of Gujars and 2.82% of Yousafzais carry O3-M122.\n56.25% of the Jadoons in another test carried West Eurasian maternal Haplogroup H (mtDNA). Dental morphology of the Swabi Jadoons was also analysed and compared to other groups in the regions like Yousufzais and Sayyids.\nDefinitions.\nThe most prominent views among Pashtuns as to who exactly qualifies as a Pashtun are:\nTribes.\nA prominent institution of the Pashtun people is the intricate system of tribes. The tribal system has several levels of organization: the tribe they are in is from four 'greater' tribal groups: the Sarbani, the Bettani, the Gharghashti, and the Karlani. The tribe is then divided into kinship groups called \"khels\", which in turn is divided into smaller groups (\"pllarina\" or \"plarganey\"), each consisting of several extended families called \"kahols\".\nDurrani and Ghilji Pashtuns.\nThe Durranis and Ghiljis (or Ghilzais) are the two largest groups of Pashtuns, with approximately two-thirds of Afghan Pashtuns belonging to these confederations. The Durrani tribe has been more urban and politically successful, while the Ghiljis are more numerous, more rural, and reputedly tougher. In the 18th century, the groups collaborated at times and at other times fought each other. With a few gaps, Durranis ruled modern Afghanistan continuously until the Saur Revolution of 1978; the new communist rulers were Ghilji. Tribal allegiances are stronger among the Ghilji, while governance of the Durrani confederation is more to do with cross-tribal structures of land ownership.\nLanguage.\nPashto is the mother tongue of most Pashtuns. It is one of the two national languages of Afghanistan. In Pakistan, although being the second-largest language being spoken, it is often neglected officially in the education system. This has been criticized as adversely impacting the economic advancement of Pashtuns, as students do not have the ability to comprehend what is being taught in other languages fully. Robert Nichols remarks:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The politics of writing Pashto language textbooks in a nationalist environment promoting integration through Islam and Urdu had unique effects. There was no lesson on any twentieth century Pakhtun, especially Abdul Ghaffar Khan, the anti-British, pro-Pakhtun nationalist. There was no lesson on the Pashtun state-builders in nineteenth and twentieth century Afghanistan. There was little or no sampling of original Pashto language religious or historical material.\u2014\u200a\nPashto is categorized as an Eastern Iranian language, but a remarkably large number of words are unique to Pashto. Pashto morphology in relation to verbs is complex compared to other Iranian languages. In this respect MacKenzie states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If we compare the archaic structure of Pashto with the much simplified morphology of Persian, the leading modern Iranian language, we see that it stands to its 'second cousin' and neighbour in something like the same relationship as Icelandic does to English.\u2014\u200a\nPashto has a large number of dialects: generally divided into Northern, Southern and Central groups; and also Tarino or Wa\u1e47etsi as distinct group. As Elfenbein notes: \"Dialect differences lie primarily in phonology and lexicon: the morphology and syntax are, again with the exception of Wanetsi, quite remarkably uniform\". Ibrahim Khan provides the following classification on the letter \u069a: the Northern Western dialect (e.g. spoken by the Ghilzai) having the phonetic value , the North Eastern (spoken by the Yusafzais etc.) having the sound , the South Western (spoken by the Abdalis etc.) having and the South Eastern (spoken by the Kakars etc.) having . He illustrates that the Central dialects, which are spoken by the Karl\u0101\u1e47 tribes, can also be divided on the North and South distinction but provides that in addition these Central dialects have had a vowel shift which makes them distinct: for instance represented by aleph the non-Central dialects becoming in Banisi dialect.\nThe first Pashto alphabet was developed by Pir Roshan in the 16th century. In 1958, a meeting of Pashtun scholars and writers from both Afghanistan and Pakistan, held in Kabul, standardized the present Pashto alphabet.\nCulture.\nPashtun culture is based on Pashtunwali, Islam and the understanding of Pashto language. The Kabul dialect is used to standardize the present Pashto alphabet. Poetry is also an important part of Pashtun culture and it has been for centuries. Pre-Islamic traditions, dating back to Alexander's defeat of the Persian Empire in 330\u00a0BC, possibly survived in the form of traditional dances, while literary styles and music reflect influence from the Persian tradition and regional musical instruments fused with localized variants and interpretation. Like other Muslims, Pashtuns celebrate Islamic holidays. Contrary to the Pashtuns living in Pakistan, Nowruz in Afghanistan is celebrated as the Afghan New Year by all Afghan ethnicities.\nJirga.\nAnother prominent Pashtun institution is the \"l\u00f3ya jirg\u00e1\" () or 'grand council' of elected elders. Most decisions in tribal life are made by members of the \"jirg\u00e1\" (), which has been the main institution of authority that the largely egalitarian Pashtuns willingly acknowledge as a viable governing body.\nReligion.\nBefore Islam there were various different beliefs which were practised by Pashtuns such as Zoroastrianism, Buddhism and Hinduism.\nThe overwhelming majority of Pashtuns adhere to Sunni Islam and belong to the Hanafi school of thought. Small Shia communities exist in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Paktia. The Shias belong to the Turi tribe while the Bangash tribe is approximately 50% Shia and the rest Sunni, who are mainly found in and around Parachinar, Kurram, Hangu, Kohat and Orakzai.\nA legacy of Sufi activity may be found in some Pashtun regions, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, as evident in songs and dances. Many Pashtuns are prominent Ulema, Islamic scholars, such as Maulana Aazam an author of more than five hundred books including Tafasee of the Quran as Naqeeb Ut Tafaseer, Tafseer Ul Aazamain, Tafseer e Naqeebi and Noor Ut Tafaseer etc., as well as Muhammad Muhsin Khan who has helped translate the Noble Quran, Sahih Al-Bukhari and many other books to the English language. Many Pashtuns want to reclaim their identity from being lumped in with the Taliban and international terrorism, which is not directly linked with Pashtun culture and history.\nLittle information is available on non-Muslim as there is limited data regarding irreligious groups and minorities, especially since many of the Hindu and Sikh Pashtuns migrated from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa after the partition of India and later, after the rise of the Taliban.\nThere are also Hindus who claim to be Pashtun, sometimes known as the Sheen Khalai (though their ethnic claim is disputed by other Pashtuns), who have moved predominantly to India. A small Hindu community, known as the \"Sheen Khalai\" meaning 'blue skinned' (referring to the color of Pashtun women's facial tattoos), migrated to Unniara, Rajasthan, India after partition. Prior to 1947, the community resided in the Quetta, Loralai and Maikhter regions of the British Indian province of Baluchistan. They are mainly claim to be members of the Pashtun Kakar tribe. Today, they continue to speak Pashto and celebrate Pashtun culture through the Attan dance.\nThere is also a minority of Pashto speaking Sikhs in Tirah, Orakzai, Kurram, Malakand, and Swat. Due to the ongoing insurgency in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, some Pashto speaking Sikhs were internally displaced from their ancestral villages to settle in cities like Peshawar and Nankana Sahib.\nPashto literature and poetry.\nThe majority of Pashtuns use Pashto as their native tongue, belonging to the Iranian language family, and spoken by up to 60\u00a0million people. It is written in the Pashto-Arabic script and is divided into two main dialects, the southern \"Pashto\" and the northern \"Pukhto\". The language has ancient origins and bears similarities to extinct languages such as Avestan and Bactrian. Its closest modern relatives may include Pamir languages, such as Shughni and Wakhi, and Ossetic. Pashto may have ancient legacy of borrowing vocabulary from neighbouring languages including such as Persian and Vedic Sanskrit. Modern borrowings come primarily from the English language.\nThe earliest describes Sheikh Mali's conquest of Swat. Pir Roshan is believed to have written a number of Pashto books while fighting with the Mughals. Pashtun scholars such as Abdul Hai Habibi and others believe that the earliest Pashto work dates back to Amir Kror Suri, and they use the writings found in Pata Khazana as proof. Amir Kror Suri, son of \"Amir Polad Suri\", was an 8th-century folk hero and king from the Ghor region in Afghanistan. However, this is disputed by several European experts due to lack of strong evidence.\nThe advent of poetry helped transition Pashto to the modern period. Pashto literature gained significant prominence in the 20th century, with poetry by Ameer Hamza Shinwari who developed \"Pashto Ghazals\". In 1919, during the expanding of mass media, Mahmud Tarzi published Seraj-al-Akhbar, which became the first Pashto newspaper in Afghanistan. In 1977, Khan Roshan Khan wrote \"Tawarikh-e-Hafiz Rehmatkhani\" which contains the family trees and Pashtun tribal names. Some notable poets include Malak Ahmad Khan Yusufzai Abdul Ghani Khan, Afzal Khan Khattak, Ahmad Shah Durrani, Gaju Khan Kalu Khan Yousafzai Ajmal Khattak, Ghulam Muhammad Tarzi, Hamza Shinwari, Hanif Baktash, Khushal Khan Khattak, Nazo Tokhi, Pareshan Khattak, Rahman Baba, Shuja Shah Durrani, and Timur Shah Durrani.\nMedia and arts.\nPashto media has expanded in the last decade, with a number of Pashto TV channels becoming available. Two of the popular ones are the Pakistan-based AVT Khyber and Pashto One. Pashtuns around the world, particularly those in Arab countries, watch these for entertainment purposes and to get latest news about their native areas. Others are Afghanistan-based Shamshad TV, Radio Television Afghanistan, TOLOnews and Lemar TV, which has a special children's show called \"Baghch-e-Simsim\". International news sources that provide Pashto programs include BBC Pashto and Voice of America.\nProducers based in Peshawar have created Pashto-language films since the 1970s.\nPashtun performers remain avid participants in various physical forms of expression including dance, sword fighting, and other physical feats. Perhaps the most common form of artistic expression can be seen in the various forms of Pashtun dances. One of the most prominent dances is \"Attan\", which has ancient roots. A rigorous exercise, Attan is performed as musicians play various native instruments including the \"dhol\" (drums), \"tablas\" (percussions), \"rubab\" (a bowed string instrument), and \"toola\" (wooden flute). With a rapid circular motion, dancers perform until no one is left dancing, similar to Sufi whirling dervishes. Numerous other dances are affiliated with various tribes notably from Pakistan including the \"Khattak Wal Atanrh\" (eponymously named after the Khattak tribe), \"Mahsood Wal Atanrh\" (which, in modern times, involves the juggling of loaded rifles), and \"Waziro Atanrh\" among others. A sub-type of the \"Khattak Wal Atanrh\" known as the \"Braghoni\" involves the use of up to three swords and requires great skill. Young women and girls often entertain at weddings with the \"Tumbal\" (Dayereh) which is an instrument.\nSports.\nBoth the Pakistan national cricket team and the Afghanistan national cricket team have Pashtun players. One of the most popular sports among Pashtuns is cricket, which was introduced to South Asia during the early 18th century with the arrival of the British. Many Pashtuns have become prominent international cricketers, including Imran Khan, Shahid Afridi, Majid Khan, Misbah-ul-Haq, Younis Khan, Umar Gul, Junaid Khan, Fakhar Zaman, Mohammad Rizwan, Usman Shinwari, Naseem Shah, Shaheen Afridi, Iftikhar Ahmed, Mohammad Wasim and Yasir Shah. Australian cricketer Fawad Ahmed is of Pakistani Pashtun origin who has played for the Australian national team.\nMakha is a traditional archery sport in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, played with a long arrow (\"gheshai\") having a saucer shaped metallic plate at its distal end, and a long bow. In Afghanistan, some Pashtuns still participate in the ancient sport of buzkashi in which horse riders attempt to place a goat or calf carcass in a goal circle.\nWomen.\nPashtun women are known to be modest and honourable because of their modest dressing. The lives of Pashtun women vary from those who reside in the ultra-conservative rural areas to those found in urban centres. At the village level, the female village leader is called \"qaryadar\". Her duties may include witnessing women's ceremonies, mobilizing women to practice religious festivals, preparing the female dead for burial, and performing services for deceased women. She also arranges marriages for her own family and arbitrates conflicts for men and women. Though many Pashtun women remain tribal and illiterate, some have completed universities and joined the regular employment world.\nThe decades of war and the rise of the Taliban caused considerable hardship among Pashtun women, as many of their rights have been curtailed by a rigid interpretation of Islamic law. The difficult lives of Afghan female refugees gained considerable notoriety with the iconic image \"Afghan Girl\" (Sharbat Gula) depicted on the June 1985 cover of \"National Geographic\" magazine.\nModern social reform for Pashtun women began in the early 20th century, when Queen Soraya Tarzi of Afghanistan made rapid reforms to improve women's lives and their position in the family. She was the only woman to appear on the list of rulers in Afghanistan. Credited with having been one of the first and most powerful Afghan and Muslim female activists. Her advocacy of social reforms for women led to a protest and contributed to the ultimate demise of King Amanullah's reign in 1929. Civil rights remained an important issue during the 1970s, as feminist leader Meena Keshwar Kamal campaigned for women's rights and founded the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan (RAWA) in the 1977.\nPashtun women these days vary from the traditional housewives who live in seclusion to urban workers, some of whom seek or have attained parity with men. But due to numerous social hurdles, the literacy rate remains considerably lower for them than for males. Abuse against women is present and increasingly being challenged by women's rights organizations which find themselves struggling with conservative religious groups as well as government officials in both Pakistan and Afghanistan. According to a 1992 book, \"a powerful ethic of forbearance severely limits the ability of traditional Pashtun women to mitigate the suffering they acknowledge in their lives.\"\nFurther challenging the status quo, Vida Samadzai was selected as Miss Afghanistan in 2003, a feat that was received with a mixture of support from those who back the individual rights of women and those who view such displays as anti-traditionalist and un-Islamic. Some have attained political office in Afghanistan and Pakistan. A number of Pashtun women are found as TV hosts, journalists and actors. In 1942, Madhubala (Mumtaz Jehan), the Marilyn Monroe of India, entered the Bollywood film industry. Bollywood blockbusters of the 1970s and 1980s starred Parveen Babi, who hailed from the lineage of Gujarat's historical Pathan community: the royal Babi Dynasty. Other Indian actresses and models, such as Zarine Khan, continue to work in the industry. During the 1980s many Pashtun women served in the ranks of the Afghan communist regime's Military. Khatol Mohammadzai served paratrooper during the Afghan Civil War and was later promoted to brigadier general in the Afghan Army. Nigar Johar is a three-star general in the Pakistan Army, another Pashtun female became a fighter pilot in the Pakistan Air Force. \nPashtun women often have their legal rights curtailed in favour of their husbands or male relatives. For example, though women are officially allowed to vote in Pakistan, some have been kept away from ballot boxes by males.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "36975", "revid": "1686264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36975", "title": "Electric boat", "text": "Type of watercraft\nAn electric boat is a powered watercraft driven by electric motors, which are powered by either on-board battery packs, solar panels or generators.\nWhile a significant majority of water vessels are powered by diesel engines, with sail power and gasoline engines also popular, boats powered by electricity have been used for over 120 years. Electric boats were very popular from the 1880s until the 1920s, when the internal combustion engine became dominant. Since the energy crises of the 1970s, interest in electric boats has been increasing steadily, especially as more efficient solar cells have become available, for the first time making possible motorboats with a theoretically infinite cruise range like sailboats. The first practical solar boat was probably constructed in 1975 in England. The first electric sailboat to complete a round-the-world tour (including a transit of the Panama Canal) using only green technologies is EcoSailingProject.\nOne of the main benefit of shift to electric from fossil fuelled boats apart from environmental benefit is the low cost of operation. The spread between diesel and electric depends on fuel cost and grid cost in the respective region, but in a place like India this could be factor of ten.\nHistory.\nEarly.\nAn early electric boat was developed by the German inventor Moritz von Jacobi in 1839 in St Petersburg, Russia. It was a boat which carried 14 passengers at . It was successfully demonstrated to Emperor Nicholas I of Russia on the Neva River.\nGolden Age.\nIt took more than 30 years of battery and motor development before the electric boat became a practical proposition. This method of propulsion enjoyed something of a golden age from about 1880 to 1920, when gasoline-powered outboard motors became the dominant method. Gustave Trouv\u00e9, a French electrical engineer, patented a small electric motor in 1880. He initially suggested that the motor could power a set of paddle wheels to propel boats on the water, and later argued for the use of a propeller.\nAn Austrian \u00e9migr\u00e9 to Britain, Anthony Reckenzaun, was instrumental in the development of the first practical electric boats. While working as an engineer for the Electrical Power Storage Company, he undertook much original and pioneering work on various forms of electric traction. In 1882 he designed the first significant electric launch driven by storage batteries, and named the boat \"Electricity\". The boat had a steel hull. It was about long, with a beam of about and a draught of about . It was fitted with a diameter propeller. The batteries and electric equipment were hidden from view beneath the seating area, increasing the space available for the accommodation of passengers. The boats were used for leisure excursions up and down the River Thames and provided a very smooth, clean and quiet trip. The boat could run for six hours and operate at an average speed of 8 miles per hour.\nMoritz Immisch established his company in 1882 in partnership with William Keppel, 7th Earl of Albemarle, specializing in the application of electric motors to transportation. The company employed Magnus Volk as a manager in the development of their electric launch department. After 12 months of experimental work starting in 1888 with a randan skiff, the firm commissioned the construction of hulls which they equipped with electrical apparatus. The world's first fleet of electric launches for hire, with a chain of electrical charging stations, was established along the River Thames in the 1880s. An 1893 pleasure map of the Thames shows eight \"charging stations for electric launches\" between Kew (Strand-on-the-Green) and Reading (Caversham). The company built its headquarters on the island called Platt's Eyot.\nFrom 1889 until just before the First World War the boating season and regattas saw the silent electric boats plying their way up and downstream.\nThe company's electric launches were widely used by the rich as a conveyance along the river. Grand ships were constructed of teak or mahogany and furnished luxuriously, with stained glass windows, silk curtains and velvet cushions. William Sargeant was commissioned by Immisch's company to build the \"Mary Gordon\" in 1898 for Leeds City Council for use on the Roundhay Park Lake \u2013 the boat still survives and is currently being restored. This 70-foot long luxury pleasure craft could carry up to 75 passengers in comfort. Launches were exported elsewhere \u2013 they were used in the Lake District and all over the world.\nIn the 1893 Chicago World Fair 55 launches developed from Anthony Reckenzaun's work carried more than a million passengers. Electric boats had an early period of popularity between around 1890 and 1920, before the emergence of the internal combustion engine drove them out of most applications.\nMost of the electric boats of this era were small passenger boats on non-tidal waters at a time when the only power alternative was steam.\nDecline.\nWith the advent of the gasoline-powered outboard motor, the use of electric power on boats declined from the 1920s. However, in a few situations, the use of electric boats has persisted from the early 20th century to the present day. One of these is on the K\u00f6nigssee lake, near Berchtesgaden in south-eastern Germany. Here the lake is considered so environmentally sensitive that steam and motor boats have been prohibited since 1909. Instead the Bayerische Seenschifffahrt company and its predecessors have operated a fleet of electric launches to provide a public passenger service on the lake.\nThe first electrically powered submarines were built in the 1890s, such as the Spanish Peral submarine, launched in 1888. Since then, electric power has been used almost exclusively for the powering of submarines underwater (traditionally by batteries), although diesel was used for directly powering the propeller while on the surface until the development of diesel\u2013electric transmission by the US Navy in 1928, in which the propeller was always powered by an electric motor, energy coming from batteries while submerged or diesel generator while surfaced.\nThe use of combined fuel and electric propulsion (\"combined diesel\u2013electric or gas\", or CODLOG) has gradually been extended over the years to the extent that some modern liners such as the Queen Mary 2 use only electric motors for the actual propulsion, powered by diesel and gas turbine engines. The advantages include being able to run the fuel engines at an optimal speed at all times and being able to mount the electric motor in a pod which may be rotated by 360\u00b0 for increased manoeuvrability. Note that this is not actually an \"electric boat\", but rather a variant of diesel\u2013electric or turbine\u2013electric propulsion, similar to the diesel or electric propulsion used on submarines since WWI.\nRenaissance.\nThe use of electricity alone to power boats stagnated apart from their outboard use as trolling motors until the Duffy Electric Boat Company of California started mass-producing small electric craft in 1968. It was not until 1982 that the Electric Boat Association was formed and solar powered boats started to emerge. To reduce friction and increase range, some boats use hydrofoils. The eWolf tugboat that launched in March 2024 has a 6.2 megawatt-hour main propulsion battery and two electric drives and is more powerful than the diesel tugboats at the port.\nFerries.\nIn 2023, electric-powered hybrid boats began to be widely adopted in India as a mode of urban transport, supplementing metro rail systems by utilizing rivers and other waterways. The Kochi Water Metro was the first project to be deployed with electric ferri3w. Its fleet consists of 78 electric boats, all built by Cochin Shipyard. Each vessel has a passenger capacity of around 100 and is capable of cruising at speeds of up to 10 knots. It uses 300 kW chargers which can charge the boat within 15 minutes.\nFollowing the successful operation of the Kochi Water Metro, the model was replicated in other Indian cities. As of 2025, similar electric ferry services are operational in Patna and Ayodhya, with projects under implementation in a total of 21 Indian cities.\nIncat Tasmania's Hull 096 is slated for use as a ferry in South America, carrying 2,100 people and 225 cars/trip. It offers a 40 megawatt-hour battery, in 12 battery arrays with 418 modules apiece, weighing 250 tonnes. The battery is air cooled with fans for each module. The batteries power eight axial-flow water jets driven by permanent magnet electric motors. The ship can operate 90 minutes between charges. Charging is planned to take 40 minutes (at 60 mw).\nComponents.\nThe main components of the drive system of any electrically powered boat are similar in all cases, and similar to the options available for any electric vehicle.\nCharger.\nElectric energy has to be obtained for the battery bank from some source like the sun.\nIn all cases, a charge regulator is needed. This ensures that the batteries are charged at their maximum safe rate when power is available, without overheating or internal damage, and that they are not overcharged when nearing full charge.\nAn alternative to charging is changing batteries while in port. It offers the benefit of removing the need to wait for the recharging to complete before sailing. This approach has the potential to allow ships and ferries with tight schedules to be electrified as charging can be done in port with no time limitations.\nBattery bank.\nThere have been significant technical advances in battery technology in recent years, and more are to be expected in the future.\nAmong the various battery chemistry the choice between a fast charging (LTO, NMC etc.) versus slow charging (LFP) is decided by economic analysis considering Capital expenditure (CAPEX), Operating expense (OPEX), Total cost of Ownership (TCO). It is observed that for higher energy need because of high speed or large weight with intermitted charging is an area where fast charging batteries become more economical.\nThe size of the battery bank determines the \"range\" of the boat under electric power. The speed at which the boat is motored also affects range \u2013 a lower speed can make a big difference to the energy required to move a hull. Other factors that affect range include sea-state, currents, windage and any charge that can be reclaimed while under way, for example by solar panels in full sun. A wind turbine in a good wind will help, and motor-sailing in any wind could do so even more.\nSpeed controller.\nTo make the boat usable and manoeuvrable, a simple-to-operate forward/stop/backwards speed controller is needed. This must be efficient\u2014i.e. it must not get hot and waste energy at any speed\u2014and it must be able to stand the full current that could conceivably flow under any full-load condition. One of the most common types of speed controllers uses pulse-width modulation (PWM). PWM controllers send high frequency pulses of power to the motor(s). As more power is needed the pulses become longer in duration.\nElectric motor.\nA wide variety of electric motor technologies are in use. Traditional field-wound DC motors were and still are used. Today many boats use lightweight permanent magnet DC motors. The advantage of both types is that while the speed can be controlled electronically, this is not a requirement. Some boats use AC motors or permanent magnet brushless motors. The advantages of these are the lack of commutators which can wear out or fail and the often lower currents allowing thinner cables; the disadvantages are the total reliance on the required electronic controllers and the usually high voltages which require a high standard of insulation.\nDrive train.\nTraditional boats use an inboard motor powering a propeller through a propeller shaft complete with bearings and seals. Often a gear reduction is incorporated in order to be able to use a larger more efficient propeller. This can be a traditional gear box, coaxial planetary gears or a transmission with belts or chains. Because of the inevitable loss associated with gearing, many drives eliminate it by using slow high-torque motors. The electric motor can be encapsulated into a pod with the propeller and fixed outside the hull (saildrive) or on an outboard fixture (outboard motor).\nTypes.\nThere are as many types of electric boat as there are boats with any other method of propulsion, but some types are significant for various reasons.\nNorway's first battery\u2013electric ferry is , with capacity for 120 cars and 12 trucks. As of November 2016[ [update]], it has operated for 106,000\u00a0km. Its battery holds 1 MWh of energy, but the 9-minute charge time is sometimes not enough, and more battery capacity is to be installed. Norway has scheduled several other electric ferry projects. Based on operational data, Siemens concludes in a life cycle analysis that 61 of Norway's 112 diesel ferry routes could be replaced by electric ferries with a payback time of 5 years. The analysis includes auxiliary costs such as chargers, grid, and so on.\nIn Finland \"F\u00f6ri\", the historic Turku city ferry across the Aura River to Abo, was converted to all-electric propulsion in April 2017. The vessel was introduced as a wood-burning steam ferry in 1904, converted to diesel operation in 1955 and now provides a continuous daily service from 0615 to late evening for foot and cycle passengers on battery power. Charging takes place at night.\nOther projects are considered in Canada, Sweden and Denmark.\nIndia's First Solar Ferry, a 75-passenger boat, that is powered by sun and grid charging with lithium batteries, began service in 2017. Based on the predictions of consumption the payback time is 3 years.\nSome ferries can charge their onboard batteries while docked by using a pantograph.\nOn the other hand, ferries can include, sometimes free, charging points for the passengers' transported electric bicycle, electric motorcycles and electric cars.\nWired electric boats.\nTrolley boats are a special category of electric boats are the vessels receiving their electrical power by wire. This may involve overhead wires, where one or two wires are fixed over the water and the boat can make contact with them to draw electric current, or a waterproof tether cable may be used to connect the boat to shore. In case of a single overhead wire the electrical circuit has to be closed by the water itself, giving rise to a larger resistance and corrosion of the electrodes. In case of two wires no electric current has to be sent through the water, but the twin wires, which cause a short-circuit whenever they come into contact with each other, complicate the construction.\nNaturally the boat has to stay close to the wire, or its tether point, and therefore it is limited in its manoeuvrability. For ferries and on narrow canals this is no problem. The Straussee Ferry in Strausberg, Germany is an example. It crosses a lake along a 370\u00a0m trajectory and is powered by 170\u00a0V from a single overhead wire. The Kastellet ferry crosses a wide shipping channel in Sweden, using a submergible tethered supply cable which is lowered to the sea-bed when the ferry is docked at the opposite terminal to its tethering point.\nIn the Mauvages tunnel on the Marne-Rhine Canal a bipolar overhead line provides 600\u00a0V DC to an electrical tug, pulling itself and several ships through the 4877\u00a0m tunnel along a submerged chain. This prevents the buildup of diesel exhaust fumes in the tunnel. Another example was the experimental electrical tug Teltow on the Kleinmachnower See, 17\u00a0km south-west of Berlin. It was used from 1903 until 1910 and had current collection poles based on those used by trolley buses.\nPollution and embodied energy.\nAll the component parts of any boat have to be manufactured and will eventually have to be disposed of. Some pollution and use of other energy sources are inevitable during these stages of the boat's life and electric boats are no exception. The benefits to the global environment that are achieved by the use of electric propulsion are manifested during the working life of the boat, which can be many years. These benefits are also most directly felt in the sensitive and beautiful environments in which such a boat is used.\nA 2016 life-cycle study in Norway states that electric ferries and hybrid offshore supply ships compensate for the environmental effects of producing lithium-ion batteries in less than 2 months.\nHistoric debate.\nThe British \"Classic Boat\" magazine carried a pro and con article entitled \"Electric debate\" in May 2010, when lead\u2013acid batteries dominated the battery market, and fossil fuels dominated the UK electricity system. Jamie Campbell argued against electric boating on four main counts, which were rebuffed by Kevin Desmond and Ian Rutter of the Electric Boat Association. Jamie Campbell asserted that electric propulsion can no more be justified afloat than a \"Seagull\" outboard motor, proposing wooden sailing boats and rowing dinghies as \"by far the most environmentally sensitive and renewable options for recreational boating\".\nElectricity production.\nCampbell asserts that the lack of pollution from an electric boat \"reeks of nimbyism\" as \"the discharge is all in someone else's back yard\" and that the provision of re-charging points may involve digging up miles of habitat. Desmond responds that while there is no doubt that rechargeable batteries derive their energy from power stations (when not charged on board by solar and wind generation), noisier internal-combustion-engined boats obtain their fuel from even further away and that, once installed a power cable is less environmentally disruptive than a petrol station. Rutter notes that electric boats tend to recharge overnight, using 'base load'.\nEfficiency.\nWhile there are losses in the charge/discharge cycle and in the conversion of electricity to motive power, Rutter points out that most electric boats need only about to cruise at , a common maximum river speed and that a petrol or diesel engine producing only is considerably more inefficient. While Campbell refers to heavy batteries requiring a \"load-bearing hull\" and \"cranky, even unseaworthy vessels\", Desmond points out that electric boaters tend to prefer efficient, low-wash hull forms that are more friendly to river banks.\nPollution.\nCampbell discusses the pollution that \"traditional\" batteries put into the water when a boat sinks, but Desmond says that electric boats are no more liable to sinking than other types and lists the leakage of fuel, engine oil and coolant additives as inevitable when an internal-combustion-engined boat sinks. Rutter points to the \"very nasty cocktail of pollutants\" that come out of a diesel wet exhaust in normal use.\nBattery manufacture.\nCampbell mentions \"all manner of noxious chemicals ... involved in battery manufacture\", but Rutter describes them as being \"lead and sulphuric acid with a few extra trace metals in a modest plastic box\" with a potential lifetime of 10\u201312 years. Desmond says that the US has a 98% recycling rate for lead acid batteries and that the battery and lead-smelting industries observe some of the tightest pollution control standards in the world.\nThe article mentions 25% and 30% discounts being offered to electric boaters by the UK Environment Agency and the Broads Authority and that battery powered vehicles have &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3\u20445 the carbon footprint of their petrol equivalents. It is claimed that a typical recharge after a day's cruising costs \u00a31.50, without the use of solar or wind power.\nSolar ships.\nThe first passenger solar vessels started to appear in Switzerland in 1995 with the \"Solifleur\" (pictured above), which was also the first solar vessel to feed more energy into the electricity grid than it consumed, on a yearly average, via a grid connection when docked.\nIn 2010, the T\u00fbranor PlanetSolar, a 35-metre long, 26-metre wide catamaran yacht powered by 537 square metres of solar panels, was unveiled. On 4 May 2012 it completed a circumnavigation of the Earth in Monaco after 585 days and visiting 28 different countries, without using any fossil fuel. It is so far the largest solar-powered boat ever built.\nIndia's first solar ferry \u2013 the Aditya \u2013 a 75-passenger boat fully powered by sun, is under construction. It is expected to be completed by the middle of 2016.\nJapan's biggest shipping line Nippon Yusen and Nippon Oil Corporation said solar panels capable of generating 40 kilowatts of electricity would be placed on top of a 60,000 tonne car carrier ship to be used by Toyota Motor Corporation.\nThe Monaco yacht company Wally has announced a \"gigayacht\" designed for billionaires torn between buying a mansion and a superyacht. The \"Why 58 x 38\" is designed to have an autonomous cruising range of 12,000 miles at 12 knots by means of 900m2 of solar panels which generate 150\u00a0kW to assist the diesel\u2013electric motors and optional Skysails.\nList of battery\u2013electric ships.\nSolar electric catamaran vessel to carry at least 50 passengers.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It has been the primary builder of submarines for the United States Navy for more than 100 years. The company's main facilities are a shipyard in Groton, Connecticut, a hull-fabrication and outfitting facility in Quonset Point, Rhode Island, and a design and engineering facility in New London, Connecticut.\nHistory.\nThe company was founded in 1899 by Isaac Rice as the Electric Boat Company to build John Philip Holland's submersible ship designs, which were developed at Lewis Nixon's Crescent Shipyard in Elizabeth, New Jersey. \"Holland VI\" was the first submarine that this shipyard built, which became when it was commissioned into the United States Navy on April 11, 1900\u2014the first submarine to be officially commissioned. The success of \"Holland VI\" created a demand for follow-up models (A class or ) that began with the prototype submersible \"Fulton\" built at Electric Boat. Some foreign navies were interested in Holland's latest submarine designs, and so purchased the rights to build them under licensing contracts through the company; these included the United Kingdom's Royal Navy, the Imperial Japanese Navy, the Imperial Russian Navy, and the Royal Netherlands Navy.\nFrom 1907 to 1925, Electric Boat designed submarines for the US Navy and subcontracted their construction to the Fore River Shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts and other shipyards. During this era, the company designed submarines of the B, C, D, E, K, L, M, N, AA-1, O, R, and S classes.\nDuring the World War I era, the company and its subsidiaries (notably the Electric Launch Company, or Elco) built 85 submarines via subcontractors and 722 submarine chasers for the US Navy, and 580 80-foot motor launches for the British Royal Navy.\nInterwar.\nAfter the war, the US Navy did not order another submarine from Electric Boat until in 1931. \"Cuttlefish\" was the first submarine built at EB's plant in Groton, Connecticut which has been its primary submarine manufacturing facility ever since. EB was the lead yard for several classes of submarines (\"Perch\", \"Salmon\", \"Sargo\", \"Tambor\", \"Gar\", \"Mackerel\" and \"Gato\") prior to World War II.\nStarting in the early 1930s, EB was one of only two major US submarine manufacturers (the other being the Portsmouth Navy Yard) until the late 1950s. Three other yards (Manitowoc, Mare Island, and Cramp) produced submarines only during World War II. Several other yards (New York Shipbuilding, Ingalls and Fore River Shipyard) as well as Mare Island built submarines in the late 1950s through the early 1970s. Since 1974, only Electric Boat and Newport News have built submarines for the US Navy.\nWorld War II.\nDuring World War II, the company built 74 submarines at the Groton plant, while Elco built nearly 400 PT boats, and Electric Boat ranked 77th among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts.\nPost war.\nIn 1952, Electric Boat was reorganized as General Dynamics Corporation under John Jay Hopkins. General Dynamics acquired Convair the following year, and the holding company assumed the \"General Dynamics\" name while the submarine-building operation reverted to the \"Electric Boat\" name.\nElectric Boat built the first nuclear submarine, , which was launched in January 1954, and the first ballistic missile submarine, , in 1959. Submarines of the , , , and es were also constructed by Electric Boat. In 2002, EB conducted preservation work on \"Nautilus\", preparing her for her berth at the US Navy Submarine Force Library and Museum in Groton, Connecticut where she now resides as a museum.\nFrom the mid-1970s to the present, EB has been one of only two submarine manufacturers in the United States, with the other being Newport News Shipbuilding in Virginia.\nIn April 2014, EB was awarded a $17.8 billion contract with Naval Sea Systems Command for ten Block IV \"Virginia\"-class attack submarines. It is the largest single shipbuilding contract in the service's history. The company builds the submarine along with Huntington Ingalls Industries Newport News Shipbuilding. The boats of Block IV \"Virginia\"s will cost less than Block III, as Electric Boat reduced the cost of the submarines by increasing efficiency in the construction process. The submarines of this type will build on the improvements to allow them to spend less time in the yard. In 2019, EB received a contract with Naval Sea Systems Command to begin procuring materials for the Block V variant of the \"Virginia\"-class. This upgrade brings the \"Virginia\" payload module, which enables Tomahawk missiles to be carried by the submarine.\n1980s structural welding defect cover up.\nIn the early 1980s, structural welding defects had been covered up by falsified inspection records, and this led to significant delays and expenses in the delivery of several submarines being built at Electric Boat's shipyard. In some cases, the repairs resulted in practically dismantling and then rebuilding what had been a nearly completed submarine. The yard tried to pass the vast cost overruns directly on to the Navy, while Admiral Hyman G. Rickover demanded from Electric Boat's general manager P. Takis Veliotis that the yard make good on its \"shoddy\" workmanship.\nThe Navy eventually settled with General Dynamics in 1981, paying out $634 million of $843 million in \"Los Angeles\"-class submarines cost-overrun and reconstruction claims. As it happened, the Navy was also the yard's insurer, liable to compensate the company for losses and other mishaps. The concept of reimbursing General Dynamics under these conditions was initially considered \"preposterous\", in the words of Secretary of the Navy John Lehman, but the eventual legal basis of General Dynamics' reimbursement claims to the Navy for the company's poor workmanship included insurance compensation. Veliotis was subsequently indicted by a federal grand jury under racketeering and fraud charges in 1983 for demanding $1.3 million in kickbacks from a subcontractor. He escaped into exile and a life of luxury in his native Greece, where he remained a fugitive from justice.\nSubmarines built.\nThis is a list of submarines built at Electric Boat's Groton plant and does not include earlier submarines built by other companies under contract to Electric Boat.\nGeneral Dynamics Electric Boat built every unique US Navy submarine after 1931, excepting and the purely experimental and .\nGeneral Dynamics Electric Boat built at least one unit of every class of serially-produced US Navy submarines after 1931, excepting the and classes.\nEB built 1 of 2 total in the class\n5 of 10 total in class\n3 of 6 total in class\n5 of 10 total in class\n6 of 12 total in class, all diesel-electric\n1 of 2 total in class\n41 of 77 total in class, all diesel-electric\n40 of 120 total in class, all diesel-electric\n1 of 29 total in class\n1 of 3 total in class\n3 of 6 total in class\nUnique submarine\n1 of 2 total in class\nUnique submarine\nUnique submarine\n1 of 4 total in class\n2 of 6 total in class\nUnique submarine\n3 of 14 total in class\nUnique submarine\n2 of 5 total in class\n2 of 5 total in class\n4 of 9 total in class\n3 of 10 total in class\n11 of 37 total in class\n6 of 12 total in class\nUnique submarine\nUnique submarine\n33 of 62 total in class\n18 of 18 total in class\n3 of 3 total in class\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "36979", "revid": "29201297", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36979", "title": "Rice", "text": "Cereal grain and staple food\nRice is a cereal grain and in its domesticated form is the staple food of over half of the world's population, particularly in Asia and Africa. Rice is the seed of the grass species \"Oryza sativa\" (Asian rice)\u2014or, much less commonly, \"Oryza glaberrima\" (African rice). Asian rice was domesticated in China some 13,500 to 8,200 years ago; African rice was domesticated in Africa about 3,000 years ago. Rice has become commonplace in many cultures worldwide; in 2023, 800 million tons were produced, placing it third after sugarcane and maize. Only some 8% of rice is traded internationally. China, India, and Indonesia are the largest consumers of rice. A substantial amount of the rice produced in developing nations is lost after harvest through factors such as poor transport and storage. Rice yields can be reduced by pests including insects, rodents, and birds, as well as by weeds, and by diseases such as rice blast. Traditional rice polycultures such as rice-duck farming, and modern integrated pest management seek to control damage from pests in a sustainable way.\nDry rice grain is milled to remove the outer layers; depending on how much is removed, products range from brown rice to rice with germ and white rice. Some is parboiled to make it easy to cook. Rice contains no gluten; it provides protein but not all the essential amino acids needed for good health. Rice of different types is eaten around the world. The composition of starch components within the grain, amylose and amylopectin, gives it different texture properties. Long-grain rice, from the \"Indica\" cultivar, tends to stay intact on cooking, and is dry and fluffy. The aromatic rice varieties, such as basmati and jasmine, are widely used in Asian cooking, and distinguished by their bold and nutty flavor profile. Medium-grain rice, from either the \"Japonica\" or \"Indica\" cultivar, or a hybrid of both, is moist and tender and tends to stick together. Its varieties include Calrose, which founded the Californian rice industry, Carnaroli, attributed as the \"king of Italian rice\" due to its excellent cooking properties, and black rice, which looks dark purple due to high levels of anthocyanins, and is also known as \"forbidden rice\" as it was reserved for the consumption of the royal family in ancient China. Short-grain rice, primarily from the \"Japonica\" cultivar, has an oval appearance and sticky texture. It is featured heavily in Japanese cooking such as sushi (with rice such as \"Koshihikari\", \"Hatsushimo\", and \"Sasanishiki\", unique to different regions of climate and geography in Japan), as it keeps its shape when cooked. It is also used for sweet dishes such as mochi (with glutinous rice), and in European cuisine such as risotto (with arborio rice) and paella (with bomba rice, which is actually an \"Indica\" variety). Cooked white rice contains 29% carbohydrate and 2% protein, with some manganese. Golden rice is a variety produced by genetic engineering to contain vitamin A.\nProduction of rice is estimated to have caused over 1% of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2022. Predictions of how rice yields will be affected by climate change vary across geographies and socioeconomic contexts. In human culture, rice plays a role in various religions and traditions, such as in weddings.\nDescription.\nThe rice plant can grow to over tall; if in deep water, it can reach a length of . From seed to harvest, it takes about six months. A single plant may have several leafy stems or tillers. The upright stem is jointed with nodes along its length; a long slender leaf arises from each node. The self-fertile flowers are produced in a panicle, a branched inflorescence which arises from the last internode on the stem. There can be up to 350 spikelets in a panicle, each containing male and female flower parts (anthers and ovule). A fertilised ovule develops into the edible grain or caryopsis.\nRice is a cereal belonging to the family Poaceae. As a tropical crop, it can be grown during the two distinct seasons (dry and wet) of the year provided that sufficient water is made available. It is normally an annual, but in the tropics it can survive as a perennial, producing a ratoon crop.\nAgronomy.\nGrowing.\nLike all crops, rice depends for its growth on both biotic and abiotic environmental factors. The principal biotic factors are crop variety, pests, and plant diseases. Abiotic factors include the soil type, whether lowland or upland, amount of rain or irrigation water, temperature, day length, and intensity of sunlight.\nRice grains can be planted directly into the field where they will grow, or seedlings can be grown in a seedbed and transplanted into the field. Direct seeding needs some 60 to 80\u00a0kg of grain per hectare, while transplanting needs less, around 40\u00a0kg per hectare, but requires far more labour. Most rice in Asia is transplanted by hand. Mechanical transplanting takes less time but requires a carefully prepared field and seedlings raised on mats or in trays to fit the machine. Rice does not thrive if continuously submerged. Rice can be grown in different environments, depending upon water availability. The usual arrangement is for lowland fields to be surrounded by bunds and flooded to a depth of a few centimetres until around a week before harvest time; this requires a large amount of water. The \"alternate wetting and drying\" technique uses less water. One form of this is to flood the field to a depth of 5\u00a0cm (2\u00a0in), then to let the water level drop to 15\u00a0cm (6\u00a0in) below surface level, as measured by looking into a perforated field water tube sunk into the soil, and then repeating the cycle. Deepwater rice varieties tolerate flooding to a depth of over 50 centimetres for at least a month. Upland rice is grown without flooding, in hilly or mountainous regions; it is rainfed like wheat or maize.\nHarvesting.\nAcross Asia, unmilled rice or \"paddy\" (Indonesian and Malay ), was traditionally the product of smallholder agriculture, with manual harvesting. Larger farms make use of machines such as combine harvesters to reduce the input of labour. The grain is ready to harvest when the moisture content is 20\u201325%. Harvesting involves reaping, stacking the cut stalks, threshing to separate the grain, and cleaning by winnowing or screening. The rice grain is dried as soon as possible to bring the moisture content down to a level that is safe from mould fungi. Traditional drying relies on the heat of the sun, with the grain spread out on mats or on pavements.\nEvolution.\nPhylogeny.\nThe edible rice species are members of the BOP clade within the grass family, the Poaceae. The rice subfamily, Oryzoideae, is sister to the bamboos, Bambusoideae, and the cereal subfamily Pooideae. The rice genus \"Oryza\" is one of eleven in the Oryzeae; it is sister to the Phyllorachideae. The edible rice species \"O. sativa\" and \"O. glaberrima\" are among some 300 species or subspecies in the genus.\nHistory.\n\"Oryza sativa\" rice was first domesticated in China 9,000 years ago, by people of Neolithic cultures in the Upper and Lower Yangtze, associated with Hmong\u2013Mien speakers and pre-Austronesians, respectively. The functional allele for nonshattering, the critical indicator of domestication in grains, as well as five other single-nucleotide polymorphisms, is identical in both \"indica\" and \"japonica\". This implies a single domestication event for \"O. sativa\". Both \"indica\" and \"japonica\" forms of Asian rice sprang from a single domestication event in China from the wild rice \"Oryza rufipogon\". Despite this evidence, it appears that \"indica\" rice arose when \"japonica\" arrived in India about 4,500 years ago and hybridised with another rice, whether an undomesticated proto-\"indica\" or wild \"O. nivara\".\nRice was introduced early into Sino-Tibetan cultures in northern China by around 6000 to 5600 years ago, and to the Korean peninsula and Japan by around 5500 to 3200 years ago. It was also carried into Taiwan by the Dapenkeng culture by 5500 to 4000 years ago, before spreading southwards via the Austronesian migrations to Island Southeast Asia, Madagascar, and Guam, but did not survive the voyage to the rest of the Pacific. It reached Austroasiatic and Kra-Dai speakers in Mainland Southeast Asia and southern China by 5000 years ago.\nRice spread around the rest of the world through cultivation, migration and trade, eventually to the Americas as part of the Columbian exchange after 1492. The now less common \"Oryza glaberrima\" (African rice) was independently domesticated in Africa around 3,000 years ago, and introduced to the Americas by the Spanish. In British North America by the time of the start of the American War of Independence, rice had become the fourth most valuable export commodity behind only tobacco, wheat, and fish.\nCommerce.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\nProduction.\nIn 2023, world production of rice was 800 million tonnes, led by China and India with a combined 52% of the total. This placed rice third in the list of crops by production, after sugarcane and maize. Other major producers were Bangladesh, Indonesia and Vietnam. 90% of world production is from Asia.\nYield records.\nThe average world yield for rice was , in 2022. Yuan Longping of China's National Hybrid Rice Research and Development Center set a world record for rice yield in 1999 at on a demonstration plot. This employed specially developed hybrid rice and the System of Rice Intensification (SRI), an innovation in rice farming.\nFood security.\nRice is a major food staple in Asia, Latin America, and some parts of Africa, feeding over half the world's population. However, a substantial part of the crop can be lost post-harvest through inefficient transportation, storage, and milling. A quarter of the crop in Nigeria is lost after harvest. Storage losses include damage by mould fungi if the rice is not dried sufficiently. In China, losses in modern metal silos were just 0.2%, compared to 7\u201313% when rice was stored by rural households.\nProcessing.\nThe dry grain is milled to remove the outer layers, namely the husk and bran. These can be removed in a single step, in two steps, or as in commercial milling in a multi-step process of cleaning, dehusking, separation, polishing, grading, and weighing. Brown rice only has the inedible husk removed. Further milling removes bran and the germ to create successively whiter products. Parboiled rice is subjected to a steaming process before it is milled. This makes the grain harder, and moves some of the grain's vitamins and minerals into the white part of the rice so these are retained after milling.\nTrade.\nWorld trade figures are much smaller than those for production, as less than 8% of rice produced is traded internationally. China, an exporter of rice in the early 2000s, had become the world's largest importer of rice by 2013. Developing countries are the main players in the world rice trade; by 2012, India was the largest exporter of rice, with Thailand and Vietnam the other largest exporters.\nWorldwide consumption.\nAs of 2016, the countries that consumed the most rice were China (29% of total), India, and Indonesia. By 2020, Bangladesh had taken third place from Indonesia. On an annual average from 2020 to 2023, China consumed 154 million tonnes of rice, India consumed 109 million tonnes, and Bangladesh and Indonesia consumed about 36 million tonnes each. Across the world, rice consumption per capita fell in the 21st century as people in Asia and elsewhere ate less grain and more meat. An exception is Sub-Saharan Africa, where both per capita consumption of rice and population are increasing.\nFood.\nEating qualities.\nRice is a commonly-eaten food around the world. The varieties of rice are typically classified as short-, medium-, and long-grained. \"Oryza sativa indica\" varieties are usually long-grained; \"Oryza sativa japonica\" varieties are usually short- or medium-grained. Short-grain rice, with the exception of Spanish Bomba, is usually sticky when cooked, and is suitable for puddings. Thai Jasmine rice is aromatic, and unusually for a long-grain rice has some stickiness, with a soft texture. Indian Basmati rice is very long-grained and aromatic. Italian Arborio rice, used for risotto, is of medium length, oval, and quite sticky. Japanese sushi rice is a sticky short-grain variety.\nNutrition.\nCooked white rice is 69% water, 29% carbohydrates, 2% protein, and contains negligible fat (table). In a reference serving of , cooked white rice provides 130 calories of food energy, and contains moderate levels of manganese (18% DV), with no other micronutrients in significant content (all less than 10% of the Daily Value).\nIn 2018, the World Health Organization strongly recommended fortifying rice with iron, and conditionally recommended fortifying it with vitamin A and with folic acid.\nRice does not contain gluten, so is suitable for people on a gluten-free diet. Rice is a good source of protein and a staple food in many parts of the world, but it is not a complete protein as it does not contain all of the essential amino acids in sufficient amounts for good health.\nGolden rice.\nGolden rice is a variety produced through genetic engineering to synthesize beta-carotene, a precursor of vitamin A, in the endosperm of the rice grain. It is intended to be grown and eaten in parts of the world where Vitamin A deficiency is prevalent. Golden rice has been opposed by anti-GMO activists, such as in the Philippines. In 2016 more than 100 Nobel laureates encouraged the use of genetically modified organisms, such as golden rice, for the benefits these could bring.\nRice and climate change.\nGreenhouse gases from rice production.\nIn 2022, greenhouse gas emissions from rice cultivation were estimated at 5.7 billion tonnes CO2eq, representing 1.2% of total emissions. Within the agriculture sector, rice produces almost half the greenhouse gas emissions from croplands, some 30% of agricultural methane emissions, and 11% of agricultural nitrous oxide emissions. Methane is released from rice fields subject to long-term flooding, as this inhibits the soil from absorbing atmospheric oxygen, resulting in anaerobic fermentation of organic matter in the soil. Emissions can be limited by planting new varieties, not flooding continuously, and removing straw.\nIt is possible to cut methane emissions in rice cultivation by improved water management, combining dry seeding and one drawdown, or executing a sequence of wetting and drying. This results in emission reductions of up to 90% compared to full flooding and even increased yields.\nEffects of climate change on rice production.\nPredictions of climate change's effects on rice cultivation vary. Global rice yield has been projected to decrease by around 3.2% with each 1\u00b0C increase in global average temperature while another study predicts global rice cultivation will increase initially, plateauing at about 3\u00b0C warming (2091\u20132100 relative to 1850\u20131900).\nThe impacts of climate change on rice cultivation vary across geographic location and socioeconomic context. For example, rising temperatures and decreasing solar radiation during the later years of the 20th century decreased rice yield by between 10% and 20% across 200 farms in seven Asian countries. This may have been caused by increased night-time respiration. IRRI has predicted that Asian rice yields will fall by some 20% per 1\u00b0C rise in global mean temperature. Further, rice is unable to yield grain if the flowers experience a temperature of 35\u00b0C or more for over one hour, so the crop would be lost under these conditions.\nIn the Po Valley in Italy, the arborio and carnaroli risotto rice varieties have suffered poor harvests through drought in the 21st century. The Ente Nazionale Risi is developing drought-resistant varieties; its \"nuovo prometeo\" variety has deep roots that enable it to tolerate drought, but is not suitable for risotto.\nPests, weeds, and diseases.\nPests and weeds.\nRice yield can be reduced by weed growth, and a wide variety of pests including insects, nematodes, rodents such as rats, snails, and birds. Major rice insect pests include armyworms, rice bugs, black bugs, cutworms, field crickets, grasshoppers, leafhoppers, mealybugs, and planthoppers. High rates of nitrogen fertiliser application may worsen aphid outbreaks. \nWeather conditions can contribute to pest outbreaks: rice gall midge outbreaks are worsened by high rainfall in the wet season, while thrips outbreaks are associated with drought.\nDiseases.\nRice blast, caused by the fungus \"Magnaporthe grisea\", is the most serious disease of growing rice. \nIt and bacterial leaf streak (caused by \"Xanthomonas oryzae\" pv. \"oryzae\") are perennially the two worst rice diseases worldwide; they are both among the ten most important diseases of all crop plants. Other major rice diseases include sheath blight (caused by \"Rhizoctonia solani\"), false smut (\"Ustilaginoidea virens\"), and bacterial panicle blight (\"Burkholderia glumae\"). Viral diseases include rice bunchy stunt, rice dwarf, rice tungro, and rice yellow mottle.\nRice plants resist disease by mounting a defence with reactive oxygen species molecules at the site where pathogens are entering. The defence is launched when a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) is detected, triggring a natural immune response (both PAMP-triggered immunity and effector-triggered immunity). Such immunity requires the gene Os-NADP-ME2. Rice blast fungus \"Magnaporthe oryzae\" uses its avirulence effector AVR-Pii to inhibit the rice plant's NADP-malic enzyme. The effect is to suppress the plant's ability to create reactive oxygen species, which means that its innate immunity fails.\nPest management.\nCrop protection scientists are developing sustainable techniques for managing rice pests. Sustainable pest management is based on four principles: biodiversity, host plant resistance, landscape ecology, and hierarchies in a landscape\u2014from biological to social. Farmers' pesticide applications are often unnecessary, and pesticides may actually induce resurgence of populations of rice pests such as the brown planthopper, both by destroying beneficial insects and by enhancing the pest's reproduction. The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) demonstrated in 1993 that an 87.5% reduction in pesticide use can lead to an overall drop in pest numbers.\nFarmers in China, Indonesia and the Philippines have traditionally managed weeds and pests by the polycultural practice of raising ducks and sometimes fish in their rice paddies. These produce valuable additional crops, eat small pest animals, manure the rice, and in the case of ducks also control weeds.\nRice plants produce their own chemical defences to protect themselves from pest attacks. Some synthetic chemicals, such as the herbicide 2,4-D, cause the plant to increase the production of certain defensive chemicals and thereby increase the plant's resistance to some types of pests. Conversely, other chemicals, such as the insecticide imidacloprid, appear to induce changes in the gene expression of the rice that make the plant more susceptible to certain pests.\nPlant breeders have created rice cultivars incorporating resistance to various insect pests. Conventional plant breeding of resistant varieties has been limited by challenges such as rearing insect pests for testing, and the great diversity and continuous evolution of pests. Resistance genes are being sought from wild species of rice, and genetic engineering techniques are being applied.\nEcotypes and cultivars.\nThe International Rice Research Institute maintains the International Rice Genebank, which holds over 100,000 rice varieties.\nMuch of southeast Asia grows sticky or glutinous rice varieties. High-yield cultivars of rice suitable for cultivation in Africa, called the New Rice for Africa (NERICA), have been developed to improve food security and alleviate poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa.\nRice cultivars also fall into groups according to environmental conditions, season of planting, and season of harvest, called ecotypes. Some major groups are the Japan-type (grown in Japan), \"bulu\" and \"tjereh\" types (Indonesia); \"aman\" (main winter crop), \"aus\" (\"aush\", summer), and \"boro\" (spring) (Bengal and Assam). Cultivars exist that are adapted to deep flooding, and these are generally called \"floating rice\". \nThe complete genome of rice was sequenced in 2005, making it the first crop plant to reach this status. \nSince then, the genomes of hundreds of types of rice, both wild and cultivated, and including both Asian and African rice species, have been sequenced.\nBiotechnology.\nHigh-yielding varieties.\nThe high-yielding varieties are a group of crops created during the Green Revolution to increase global food production radically. The first Green Revolution rice variety, IR8, was produced in 1966 at the International Rice Research Institute through a cross between an Indonesian variety named \"Peta\" and a Chinese variety named \"Dee Geo Woo Gen\". Green Revolution varieties were bred to have short strong stems so that the rice would not lodge or fall over. This enabled them to stay upright and productive even with heavy applications of fertiliser.\nExpression of human proteins.\nVentria Bioscience has genetically modified rice to express lactoferrin and lysozyme which are proteins usually found in breast milk, and human serum albumin. These proteins have antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal effects. Rice containing these added proteins can be used as a component in oral rehydration solutions to treat diarrheal diseases, thereby shortening their duration and reducing recurrence. Such supplements may also help reverse anemia.\nFlood-tolerance.\nIn areas subject to flooding, farmers have long planted flood tolerant varieties known as deepwater rice. In South and South East Asia, flooding affects some each year. \nFlooding has historically led to massive losses in yields, such as in the Philippines, where in 2006, rice crops worth $65\u00a0million were lost to flooding.\nStandard rice varieties cannot withstand stagnant flooding for more than about a week, since it disallows the plant access to necessary requirements such as sunlight and gas exchange. The Swarna Sub1 cultivar can tolerate week-long submergence, consuming carbohydrates efficiently and continuing to grow. So-called \"scuba rice\" with the Sub1A transgene is robustly tolerant of submergence for as long as two weeks, offering much improved flood survival for farmers' crops. IRRI has created Sub1A varieties and distributed them to Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Nepal, and the Philippines.\nDrought-tolerance.\nDrought represents a significant environmental stress for rice production, with of rainfed rice production in South and South East Asia often at risk. Under drought conditions, without sufficient water to afford them the ability to obtain the required levels of nutrients from the soil, conventional commercial rice varieties can be severely affected\u2014as happened for example in India early in the 21st century.\nThe International Rice Research Institute conducts research into developing drought-tolerant rice varieties, including the varieties Sahbhagi Dhan, Sahod Ulan, and Sookha dhan, currently being employed by farmers in India, the Philippines, and Nepal respectively. In addition, in 2013 the Japanese National Institute for Agrobiological Sciences led a team which successfully inserted the \"DEEPER ROOTING 1\" (\"DRO1\") gene, from the Philippine upland rice variety Kinandang Patong, into the popular commercial rice variety IR64, giving rise to a far deeper root system in the resulting plants. This facilitates an improved ability for the rice plant to derive its required nutrients in times of drought via accessing deeper layers of soil, a feature demonstrated by trials which saw the IR64 + DRO1 rice yields drop by 10% under moderate drought conditions, compared to 60% for the unmodified IR64 variety.\nSalt-tolerance.\nSoil salinity poses a major threat to rice crop productivity, particularly along low-lying coastal areas during the dry season. For example, roughly of the coastal areas of Bangladesh are affected by saline soils. These high concentrations of salt can severely affect rice plants' physiology, especially during early stages of growth, and as such farmers are often forced to abandon these areas.\nProgress has been made in developing rice varieties capable of tolerating such conditions; the hybrid created from the cross between the commercial rice variety IR56 and the wild rice species \"Oryza coarctata\" is one example. \"O. coarctata\" can grow in soils with double the limit of salinity of normal varieties, but does not produce edible rice. Developed by the International Rice Research Institute, the hybrid variety utilises specialised leaf glands that remove salt into the atmosphere. It was produced from one successful embryo out of 34,000 crosses between the two species; this was then backcrossed to IR56 with the aim of preserving the genes responsible for salt tolerance that were inherited from \"O. coarctata\".\nCold tolerance.\nRice is sensitive to temperatures below 12\u00b0C. Sowing takes place once the daily average temperature is reliably above this limit. Average temperatures below that reduce growth; if sustained for over four days, germination and seedling growth are harmed and seedlings may die. In larger plants subjected to cold, rice blast is encouraged, seriously reducing yield. As of 2022, researchers continue to study the mechanisms of chilling tolerance in rice and its genetic basis. Cold-tolerant varieties including of risotto rice and basmati rice have been trialled successfully on peaty soil in England in 2025. If, as is probable, global warming raises the temperature by 2\u00b0C or more, rice could be grown across the country.\nReducing methane emissions.\nProducing rice in paddies is harmful for the environment due to the release of methane by methanogenic bacteria. These bacteria live in the anaerobic waterlogged soil, consuming nutrients released by rice roots. Putting the barley gene \"SUSIBA2\" into rice creates a shift in biomass production from root to shoot, decreasing the methanogen population, and resulting in a reduction of methane emissions of up to 97%. Further, the modification increases the amount of rice grains.\nC4 rice.\nC4 rice is a proposed rice that uses C4 photosynthesis. It is currently in development by the C4 Rice Consortium.\nModel organism.\nRice is used as a model organism for investigating the mechanisms of meiosis and DNA repair in higher plants. For example, study using rice has shown that the gene \"OsRAD51C\" is necessary for the accurate repair of DNA double-strand breaks during meiosis.\nIn human culture.\nRice plays an important role in certain religions and popular beliefs. In Hindu wedding ceremonies, rice, denoting fertility, prosperity, and purity, is thrown into the sacred fire, a custom modified in Western weddings, where people throw rice over the wedded couple. In Malay weddings, rice features in multiple special wedding foods such as sweet glutinous rice. In Japan and the Philippines, rice wine is used for weddings and other celebrations. Dewi Sri is a goddess of the Indo-Malaysian archipelago, who in myth is transformed into rice or other crops. The start of the rice planting season is marked in Asian countries including Nepal and Cambodia with a Royal Ploughing Ceremony.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Most pure clay minerals are white or light-coloured, but natural clays show a variety of colours from impurities, such as a reddish or brownish colour from small amounts of iron oxide.\nClays develop plasticity when wet but can be hardened through firing. Clay is the longest-known ceramic material. Prehistoric humans discovered the useful properties of clay and used it for making pottery. Some of the earliest pottery shards have been dated to around 14,000\u00a0BCE, and clay tablets were the first known writing medium. Clay is used in many modern industrial processes, such as paper making, cement production, and chemical filtering. Between one-half and two-thirds of the world's population live or work in buildings made with clay, often baked into brick, as an essential part of its load-bearing structure. In agriculture, clay content is a major factor in determining land arability. Clay soils are generally less suitable for crops due to poor natural drainage; however, clay soils are more fertile, due to higher cation-exchange capacity.\nClay is a very common substance. Shale, formed largely from clay, is the most common sedimentary rock. Although many naturally occurring deposits include both silts and clay, clays are distinguished from other fine-grained soils by differences in size and mineralogy. Silts, which are fine-grained soils that do not include clay minerals, tend to have larger particle sizes than clays. Mixtures of sand, silt and less than 40% clay are called loam. Soils high in \"swelling clays\" (expansive clay), which are clay minerals that readily expand in volume when they absorb water, are a major challenge in civil engineering.\nProperties.\nThe defining mechanical property of clay is its plasticity when wet and its ability to harden when dried or fired. Clays show a broad range of water content within which they are highly plastic, from a minimum water content (called the plastic limit) where the clay is just moist enough to mould, to a maximum water content (called the liquid limit) where the moulded clay is just dry enough to hold its shape. The plastic limit of kaolinite clay ranges from about 36% to 40% and its liquid limit ranges from about 58% to 72%. High-quality clay is also tough, as measured by the amount of mechanical work required to roll a sample of clay flat. Its toughness reflects a high degree of internal cohesion.\nClay has a high content of clay minerals that give it its plasticity. Clay minerals are hydrous aluminium phyllosilicate minerals, composed of aluminium and silicon ions bonded into tiny, thin plates by interconnecting oxygen and hydroxide ions. These plates are tough but flexible, and in moist clay, they adhere to each other. The resulting aggregates give clay the cohesion that makes it plastic. In kaolinite clay, the bonding between plates is provided by a film of water molecules that hydrogen bond the plates together. The bonds are weak enough to allow the plates to slip past each other when the clay is being moulded, but strong enough to hold the plates in place and allow the moulded clay to retain its shape after it is moulded. When the clay is dried, most of the water molecules are removed, and the plates form direct hydrogen bonds with each other, making the dried clay rigid but still fragile. If the clay is moistened again, it will once more become plastic. When the clay is fired to the earthenware stage, a dehydration reaction removes additional water from the clay, causing clay plates to irreversibly adhere to each other via stronger covalent bonding, which strengthens the material. The clay mineral kaolinite is transformed into a non-clay material, metakaolin, which remains rigid and hard if moistened again. Further firing through the stoneware and porcelain stages further recrystallizes the metakaolin into yet stronger minerals such as mullite.\nThe tiny size and plate form of clay particles gives clay minerals a high surface area. In some clay minerals, the plates carry a negative electrical charge that is balanced by a surrounding layer of positive ions (cations), such as sodium, potassium, or calcium. If the clay is mixed with a solution containing other cations, these can swap places with the cations in the layer around the clay particles, which gives clays a high capacity for ion exchange. The chemistry of clay minerals, including their capacity to retain nutrient cations such as potassium and ammonium, is important to soil fertility.\nClay is a common component of sedimentary rock. Shale is formed largely from clay and is the most common of sedimentary rocks. However, most clay deposits are impure. Many naturally occurring deposits include both silts and clay. Clays are distinguished from other fine-grained soils by differences in size and mineralogy. Silts, which are fine-grained soils that do not include clay minerals, tend to have larger particle sizes than clays. There is, however, some overlap in particle size and other physical properties. The distinction between silt and clay varies by discipline. Geologists and soil scientists usually consider the separation to occur at a particle size of 2 \u03bcm (clays being finer than silts), sedimentologists often use 4\u20135 \u03bcm, and colloid chemists use 1 \u03bcm. Clay-size particles and clay minerals are not the same, despite a degree of overlap in their respective definitions. Geotechnical engineers distinguish between silts and clays based on the plasticity properties of the soil, as measured by the soils' Atterberg limits. ISO 14688 grades clay particles as being smaller than 2 \u03bcm and silt particles as being larger. Mixtures of sand, silt and less than 40% clay are called loam.\nSome clay minerals (such as smectite) are described as swelling clay minerals, because they have a great capacity to take up water, and they increase greatly in volume when they do so. When dried, they shrink back to their original volume. This produces distinctive textures, such as mudcracks or \"popcorn\" texture, in clay deposits. Soils containing swelling clay minerals (such as bentonite) pose a considerable challenge for civil engineering, because swelling clay can break foundations of buildings and ruin road beds.\nAgriculture.\nClay is generally considered undesirable for agriculture, although some amount of clay is a necessary component of good soil. Compared to other soils, clay soils are less suitable for crops due to their tendency to retain water, and require artificial drainage and tillage to make suitable for planting. However, clay soils are often more fertile and can hold onto nutrients better due to their higher cation-exchange capacity, allowing more land to remain in production rather than being left fallow. As clay tends to retain nutrients for longer before leaching them, this also means plants may require more fertilizer in clay soils.\nFormation.\nClay minerals most commonly form by prolonged chemical weathering of silicate-bearing rocks. They can also form locally from hydrothermal activity. Chemical weathering takes place largely by acid hydrolysis due to low concentrations of carbonic acid, dissolved in rainwater or released by plant roots. The acid breaks bonds between aluminium and oxygen, releasing other metal ions and silica (as a gel of orthosilicic acid).)\nThe clay minerals formed depend on the composition of the source rock and the climate. Acid weathering of feldspar-rich rock, such as granite, in warm climates tends to produce kaolin. Weathering of the same kind of rock under alkaline conditions produces illite. Smectite forms by weathering of igneous rock under alkaline conditions, while gibbsite forms by intense weathering of other clay minerals.\nThere are two types of clay deposits: primary and secondary. Primary clays form as residual deposits in soil and remain at the site of formation. Secondary clays are clays that have been transported from their original location by water erosion and deposited in a new sedimentary deposit. Secondary clay deposits are typically associated with very low energy depositional environments such as large lakes and marine basins.\nVarieties.\nThe main groups of clays include kaolinite, montmorillonite-smectite, and illite. Chlorite, vermiculite, talc, and pyrophyllite are sometimes also classified as clay minerals. There are approximately 30 different types of \"pure\" clays in these categories, but most \"natural\" clay deposits are mixtures of these different types, along with other weathered minerals. Clay minerals in clays are most easily identified using X-ray diffraction rather than chemical or physical tests.\nVarve (or \"varved clay\") is clay with visible annual layers that are formed by seasonal deposition of those layers and are marked by differences in erosion and organic content. This type of deposit is common in former glacial lakes. When fine sediments are delivered into the calm waters of these glacial lake basins away from the shoreline, they settle to the lake bed. The resulting seasonal layering is preserved in an even distribution of clay sediment banding.\nQuick clay is a unique type of marine clay indigenous to the glaciated terrains of Norway, North America, Northern Ireland, and Sweden. It is a highly sensitive clay, prone to liquefaction, and has been involved in several deadly landslides.\nUses.\nModelling clay is used in art and handicraft for sculpting. Clays are used for making pottery, both utilitarian and decorative, and construction products, such as bricks, walls, and floor tiles. Different types of clay, when used with different minerals and firing conditions, are used to produce earthenware, stoneware, and porcelain. Prehistoric humans discovered the useful properties of clay. Some of the earliest pottery shards recovered are from central Honshu, Japan. They are associated with the J\u014dmon culture, and recovered deposits have been dated to around 14,000\u00a0BCE. Cooking pots, art objects, dishware, smoking pipes, and even musical instruments such as the ocarina can all be shaped from clay before being fired. \nAncient peoples in Mesopotamia adopted clay tablets as the first known writing medium. Clay was chosen due to the local material being easy to work with and widely available. Scribes wrote on the tablets by inscribing them with a script known as cuneiform, using a blunt reed called a stylus, which effectively produced the wedge shaped markings of their writing. After being written on, clay tablets could be reworked into fresh tablets and reused if needed, or fired to make them permanent records. Nowadays, clay is added as a filler to graphite, in pencil lead, to change the hardness and blackness of the pencil. Purpose-made clay balls were used as sling ammunition. Clay is used in many industrial processes, such as paper making, cement production, and chemical filtering. Bentonite clay is widely used as a mold binder in the manufacture of sand castings.\nMaterials.\nClay is a common filler used in polymer nanocomposites. It can reduce the cost of the composite, as well as impart modified behavior: increased stiffness, decreased permeability, decreased electrical conductivity, etc.\nMedicine.\nTraditional uses of clay as medicine go back to prehistoric times. An example is Armenian bole, which is used to soothe an upset stomach. Some animals such as parrots and pigs ingest clay for similar reasons. Kaolin clay and attapulgite have been used as anti-diarrheal medicines.\nConstruction.\nClay as the defining ingredient of loam is one of the oldest building materials on Earth, among other ancient, naturally occurring geologic materials such as stone and organic materials like wood. Also a primary ingredient in many natural building techniques, clay is used to create adobe, cob, cordwood, and structures and building elements such as wattle and daub, clay plaster, clay render case, clay floors and clay paints and ceramic building material. Clay was used as a mortar in brick chimneys and stone walls where protected from water.\nClay, relatively impermeable to water, is also used where natural seals are needed, such as in pond linings, the cores of dams, or as a barrier in landfills against toxic seepage (lining the landfill, preferably in combination with geotextiles). Studies in the early 21st century have investigated clay's absorption capacities in various applications, such as the removal of heavy metals from waste water and air purification.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The word is a portmanteau of \"back\" and \"acronym\". Backronyms may be invented with either serious or humorous intent, or they may be a type of false etymology or folk etymology.\nA normal acronym is a word derived from the initial letter(s) of the words of a phrase, such as \"radar\" from \"radio detection and ranging\". By contrast, a backronym is \"an acronym deliberately formed from a phrase whose initial letters spell out a particular word or words, either to create a memorable name or as a fanciful explanation of a word's origin\". Many fictional espionage organizations are backronyms, such as SPECTRE (special executive for counterintelligence, terrorism, revenge and extortion) from the \"James Bond\" franchise.\nFor example, the Amber alert missing-child program was named after Amber Hagerman, a nine-year-old girl who was abducted and murdered in 1996. Officials later publicized the backronym \"America's Missing: Broadcast Emergency Response\".\nBackronyms are not to be confused with contrived acronyms, where an acronym for a desired word is created \"prospectively\", rather than \"retrospectively\" as it is with backronyms.\nExamples.\nAn example of a backronym as a mnemonic is the Apgar score, used to assess the health of newborn babies. The rating system was devised by and named after Virginia Apgar. Ten years after the initial publication, the backronym \"APGAR\" was coined in the US as a mnemonic learning aid: appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, and respiration. Another example is the American Contract Bridge League's tools to address cheating in online bridge games. EDGAR was originally named for Edgar Kaplan, whose many contributions to the game included groundbreaking efforts to reduce illegal partnership communication. The new EDGAR tools expected to debut in early 2024 have been launched with the backronym \"everyone deserves a game above reproach\".\nMany United States Congress bills have backronyms as their names; examples include the USA PATRIOT Act (Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act) of 2001, the CHIPS and Science Act (Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors), and the DREAM Act (Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act). \nAs false etymologies.\nSometimes a backronym is reputed to have been used in the formation of the original word, and amounts to a false etymology or an urban legend. Acronyms were rare in the English language before the 1930s, and most etymologies of common words or phrases that suggest origin from an acronym are false.\nExamples include \"posh\", an adjective describing stylish items or members of the upper class. A popular story derives the word as an acronym from \"port out, starboard home\", referring to 19th-century first-class cabins on ocean liners, which were shaded from the sun on outbound voyages east (e.g. from Britain to India) and homeward voyages west. The word's actual etymology is unknown, but more likely related to Romani ('half-penny') or to Urdu (borrowed from Persian) ('white robes'), a term for wealthy people.\nAnother example is the word \"chav\", which is a derogatory term for a working-class youth. This word is probably of Romani origin but commonly believed to be a backronym of \"council-housed and violent\".\nSimilarly, the distress signal SOS is often believed to be an abbreviation for \"save our ship\" or \"save our souls\" but was chosen because it has a simple and unmistakable Morse code representation\u00a0\u2013 three dots, three dashes, and three dots, sent without any pauses between characters.\nMore recent examples include the brand name Adidas, named after company founder Adolf \"Adi\" Dassler but falsely believed to be an acronym for \"all day I dream about sport\". \nThe word \"wiki\" is said to stand for \"what I know is\", but is in fact derived from the Hawaiian phrase \"wiki-wiki\" meaning 'fast'. \nYahoo!, sometimes claimed to mean \"yet another hierarchical officious oracle\", was in fact chosen because Yahoo's founders liked the word's meaning of \"rude, unsophisticated, uncouth\" (taken from Jonathan Swift's book \"Gulliver's Travels\").\nThe distress call \"pan-pan\" is commonly stated to mean \"possible assistance needed\", whereas it is in fact derived from the French word \"panne\", meaning 'breakdown'.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The term was first used in print in 1979 in Douglas Hofstadter's book \"G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid\", in which Hofstadter invents the acronym GOD, meaning \"GOD Over Djinn\", to help explain infinite series, and describes it as a recursive acronym. Other references followed, however the concept was used as early as 1968 in John Brunner's science fiction novel \"Stand on Zanzibar\". In the story, the acronym EPT (Education for a Particular Task) later morphed into \"Eptification for Particular Task\".\nRecursive acronyms typically form backwardly: either an existing ordinary acronym is given a new explanation of what the letters stand for, or a name is turned into an acronym by giving the letters an explanation of what they stand for, in each case with the first letter standing recursively for the whole acronym.\nUse in computing.\nIn computing, an early tradition in the hacker community, especially at MIT, was to choose acronyms and abbreviations that referred humorously to themselves or to other abbreviations. Perhaps the earliest example in this context is the backronym \"Mash Until No Good\", which was created in 1960 to describe Mung, and revised to \"Mung Until No Good\". It lived on as a recursive command in the editing language TECO.[3] In 1977 programmer Ted Anderson coined TINT (\"TINT Is Not TECO\"), an editor for MagicSix. This inspired the two MIT Lisp Machine editors called EINE (\"EINE Is Not Emacs\", German for \"one\") and ZWEI (\"ZWEI Was EINE Initially\", German for \"two\"), in turn inspiring Anderson's retort SINE (\"SINE is not EINE\"). Richard Stallman followed with GNU (GNU's Not Unix).\nRecursive acronym examples often include negatives, such as denials that the thing defined is or resembles something else (which the thing defined does in fact resemble or is even derived from), to indicate that, despite the similarities, it was distinct from the program on which it was based.\nAn earlier example appears in a 1976 textbook on data structures, in which the pseudo-language SPARKS is used to define the algorithms discussed in the text. \"SPARKS\" is claimed to be a non-acronymic name, but \"several cute ideas have been suggested\" as expansions of the name. One of the suggestions is the tail recursive \"Smart Programmers Are Required to Know SPARKS\".\nOther examples are the YAML language, which stands for \"YAML ain't markup language\" and PHP language meaning \"PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor\".\nExamples.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOther examples.\nCompanies and organizations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn media.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nBrands and products.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSpecial.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOther.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Other closely related fish in the same family include trout, char, grayling, whitefish, lenok and taimen, all coldwater fish of the subarctic and cooler temperate regions with some sporadic endorheic populations in Central Asia.\nSalmon are typically anadromous: they hatch in the shallow gravel beds of freshwater headstreams and spend their juvenile years in rivers, lakes and freshwater wetlands, migrate to the ocean as adults and live like sea fish, then return to their freshwater birthplace to reproduce. However, populations of several species are restricted to fresh waters (i.e. landlocked) throughout their lives. Folklore has it that the fish return to the exact stream where they themselves hatched to spawn, and tracking studies have shown this to be mostly true. A portion of a returning salmon run may stray and spawn in different freshwater systems; the percent of straying depends on the species of salmon. Homing behavior has been shown to depend on olfactory memory.\nSalmon are important food fish and are intensively farmed in many parts of the world, with Norway being the world's largest producer of farmed salmon, followed by Chile. They are also highly prized game fish for recreational fishing, by both freshwater and saltwater anglers. Many species of salmon have since been introduced and naturalized into non-native environments such as the Great Lakes of North America, Patagonia in South America and South Island of New Zealand.\nName and etymology.\nThe Modern English term \"salmon\" is derived from , and , which in turn are from Anglo-Norman: \"saumon\", from , and from (which in turn might have originated from \"salire\", meaning \"to leap\".). The unpronounced \"l\" absent from Middle English was later added as a Latinisation to make the word closer to its Latin root. The term \"salmon\" has mostly displaced its now dialectal synonym \"lax\", in turn from , from , from from Proto-Indo-European: \"*lakso-\".\nSpecies.\nThe seven commercially important species of salmon occur in two genera of the subfamily Salmoninae. The genus \"Salmo\" contains the Atlantic salmon, found in both sides of the North Atlantic, as well as more than 40 other species commonly named as trout. The genus \"Oncorhynchus\" contains 12 recognised species which occur naturally only in the North Pacific, six of which are known as Pacific salmon while the remainder are considered trout. Outside their native habitats, Chinook salmon have been successfully introduced in New Zealand and Patagonia, while coho, sockeye and Atlantic salmon have been established in Patagonia, as well.\nThe extinct \"Eosalmo driftwoodensis\", the oldest known Salmoninae fish in the fossil record, helps scientists figure how the different species of salmon diverged from a common ancestor. The Eocene salmon's fossil from British Columbia provides evidence that the divergence between Pacific and Atlantic salmon had not yet occurred 40 million years ago. Both the fossil record and analysis of mitochondrial DNA suggest the divergence occurred 10 to 20 million years ago during the Miocene. This independent evidence from DNA analysis and the fossil record indicate that salmon divergence occurred long before the Quaternary glaciation began the cycle of glacial advance and retreat.\nNon-salmon species of \"salmon\".\nThere are several other species of fish which are colloquially called \"salmon\" but are not true salmon. Of those listed below, the Danube salmon or \"huchen\" is a large freshwater salmonid closely related (from the same subfamily) to the seven species of salmon above, but others are fishes of unrelated orders, given the common name \"salmon\" simply due to similar shapes, behaviors and niches occupied:\nLife cycle.\nSalmon eggs are laid in freshwater streams typically at high latitudes. The eggs hatch into alevin or sac fry. The fry quickly develop into parr with camouflaging vertical stripes. The parr stay for six months to three years in their natal stream before becoming smolts, which are distinguished by their bright, silvery colour with scales that are easily rubbed off. Only 10% of all salmon eggs are estimated to survive to this stage.\nThe smolt body chemistry changes, allowing them to live in salt water. While a few species of salmon remain in fresh water throughout their life cycle, the majority are anadromous and migrate to the ocean for maturation: in these species, smolts spend a portion of their out-migration time in brackish water, where their body chemistry becomes accustomed to osmoregulation in the ocean. This body chemistry change is hormone-driven, causing physiological adjustments in the function of osmoregulatory organs such as the gills, which leads to large increases in their ability to secrete salt. Hormones involved in increasing salinity tolerance include insulin-like growth factor I, cortisol, and thyroid hormones, which permits the fish to endure the transition from a freshwater environment to the ocean.\nThe salmon spend about one to five years (depending on the species) in the open ocean, where they gradually become sexually mature. The adult salmon then return primarily to their natal streams to spawn. Atlantic salmon spend between one and four years at sea. When a fish returns after just one year's sea feeding, it is called a grilse in Canada, Britain, and Ireland. Grilse may be present at spawning, and go unnoticed by large males, releasing their own sperm on the eggs.\nPrior to spawning, depending on the species, salmon undergo changes. They may grow a hump, develop canine-like teeth, or develop a kype (a pronounced curvature of the jaws in male salmon). All change from the silvery blue of a fresh-run fish from the sea to a darker colour. Salmon can make amazing journeys, sometimes moving hundreds of miles upstream against strong currents and rapids to reproduce. Chinook and sockeye salmon from central Idaho, for example, travel over and climb nearly from the Pacific Ocean as they return to spawn. Condition tends to deteriorate the longer the fish remain in fresh water, and they then deteriorate further after they spawn, when they are known as kelts. In all species of Pacific salmon, the mature individuals die within a few days or weeks of spawning, a trait known as semelparity. Between 2 and 4% of Atlantic salmon kelts survive to spawn again, all females. However, even in those species of salmon that may survive to spawn more than once (iteroparity), postspawning mortality is quite high (perhaps as high as 40 to 50%).\nTo lay her roe, the female salmon uses her tail (caudal fin), to create a low-pressure zone, lifting gravel to be swept downstream, excavating a shallow depression, called a redd. The redd may sometimes contain 5,000 eggs covering . The eggs usually range from orange to red. One or more males approach the female in her redd, depositing sperm, or milt, over the roe. The female then covers the eggs by disturbing the gravel at the upstream edge of the depression before moving on to make another redd. The female may make as many as seven redds before her supply of eggs is exhausted.\nEach year, the fish experiences a period of rapid growth, often in summer, and one of slower growth, normally in winter. This results in ring formation around an earbone called the otolith (annuli), analogous to the growth rings visible in a tree trunk. Freshwater growth shows as densely crowded rings, sea growth as widely spaced rings; spawning is marked by significant erosion as body mass is converted into eggs and milt.\nFreshwater streams and estuaries provide important habitat for many salmon species. They feed on terrestrial and aquatic insects, amphipods, and other crustaceans while young, and primarily on other fish when older. Eggs are laid in deeper water with larger gravel and need cool water and good water flow (to supply oxygen) to the developing embryos. Mortality of salmon in the early life stages is usually high due to natural predation and human-induced changes in habitat, such as siltation, high water temperatures, low oxygen concentration, loss of stream cover, and reductions in river flow. Estuaries and their associated wetlands provide vital nursery areas for the salmon prior to their departure to the open ocean. Wetlands not only help buffer the estuary from silt and pollutants, but also provide important feeding and hiding areas.\nSalmon not killed by other means show greatly accelerated deterioration (phenoptosis, or \"programmed aging\") at the end of their lives. Their bodies rapidly deteriorate right after they spawn as a result of the release of massive amounts of corticosteroids.\nDiet.\nSalmon are mid-level carnivores whose diet change according to their life stage. Salmon fry predominantly feed upon zooplankton until they reach fingerling sizes, when they start to consume more aquatic invertebrates such as insect larvae, microcrustaceans and worms. As juveniles (parrs), they become more predatory and actively prey upon aquatic insects, small crustaceans, tadpoles and small bait fishes. They are also known to breach the water to attack terrestrial insects such as grasshoppers and dragonflies, as well as consuming fish eggs (even those of other salmon).\nAs adults, salmon behave like other mid-sized pelagic fish, eating a variety of sea creatures including smaller forage fish such as lanternfish, herrings, sand lances, mackerels and barracudina. They also eat krill, squid and polychaete worms.\nEcology.\nIn the Pacific Northwest and Alaska, salmon are keystone species. The migrations of salmon represent a massive retrograde nutrient transfer, rich in nitrogen, sulfur, carbon and phosphorus, from the ocean to the inland freshwater ecosystems. Predation by piscivorous land animals (such as ospreys, bears and otters) along the journey serve to transfer the nutrients from the water to land, and decomposition of salmon carcasses benefits the forest ecosystem.\nIn the case of Pacific salmon, most (if not all) of the salmon that survive to reach the headwater spawning grounds will die after laying eggs and their dead bodies sink to cover the gravel beds, with the nutrients released from the biodegradation of their corpses providing a significant boost to these otherwise biomass-poor shallow streams.\nBears.\nGrizzly bears function as ecosystem engineers, capturing salmon and carrying them into adjacent dry land to eat the fish. There they deposit nutrient-rich urine and feces and partially eaten carcasses. Bears preparing for hibernation tend to preferentially consume the more nutrient- and energy-rich salmon roes and brain over the actual flesh, and are estimated to discard up to half the salmon they've harvested uneaten on the forest floor, in densities that can reach per hectare, providing as much as 24% of the total nitrogen available to the riparian woodlands. The foliage of spruce trees up to from a stream where grizzlies fish salmon have been found to contain nitrogen originating from the fished salmon.\nBeavers.\nBeavers also function as ecosystem engineers; in the process of tree-cutting and damming, beavers alter the local ecosystems extensively. Beaver ponds can provide critical habitat for juvenile salmon.\nAn example of this was seen in the years following 1818 in the Columbia River Basin. In 1818, the British government made an agreement with the U.S. government to allow U.S. citizens access to the Columbia catchment (see Treaty of 1818). At the time, the Hudson's Bay Company sent word to trappers to extirpate all furbearers from the area in an effort to make the area less attractive to U.S. fur traders. In response to the elimination of beavers from large parts of the river system, salmon runs plummeted, even in the absence of many of the factors usually associated with the demise of salmon runs. Salmon recruitment can be affected by beavers' dams because dams can:\nBeaver dams are able to nurture salmon juveniles in estuarine tidal marshes where the salinity is less than 10\u00a0ppm. Beavers build small dams of generally less than high in channels in the myrtle zone. These dams can be overtopped at high tide and hold water at low tide. This provides refuges for juvenile salmon so they do not have to swim into large channels where they are subject to predation by larger fish.\nLampreys.\nIt has been discovered that rivers which have seen a decline or disappearance of anadromous lampreys, loss of the lampreys also affects the salmon in a negative way. Like salmon, anadromous lampreys stop feeding and die after spawning, and their decomposing bodies release nutrients into the stream. Also, along with species like rainbow trout and Sacramento sucker, lampreys clean the gravel in the rivers during spawning. Their larvae, called ammocoetes, are filter feeders which contribute to the health of the waters. They are also a food source for the young salmon, and being fattier and oilier, it is assumed predators prefer them over salmon offspring, taking off some of the predation pressure on smolts. Adult lampreys are also the preferred prey of seals and sea lions, which can eat 30 lampreys to every salmon, allowing more adult salmon to enter the rivers to spawn without being eaten by the marine mammals.\nParasites.\nAccording to Canadian biologist Dorothy Kieser, the myxozoan parasite \"Henneguya salminicola\" is commonly found in the flesh of salmonids. It has been recorded in the field samples of salmon returning to the Haida Gwaii Islands. The fish responds by walling off the parasitic infection into a number of cysts that contain milky fluid. This fluid is an accumulation of a large number of parasites.\n\"Henneguya\" and other parasites in the myxosporean group have complex life cycles, where the salmon is one of two hosts. The fish releases the spores after spawning. In the \"Henneguya\" case, the spores enter a second host, most likely an invertebrate, in the spawning stream. When juvenile salmon migrate to the Pacific Ocean, the second host releases a stage infective to salmon. The parasite is then carried in the salmon until the next spawning cycle. The myxosporean parasite that causes whirling disease in trout has a similar life cycle. However, as opposed to whirling disease, the \"Henneguya\" infestation does not appear to cause disease in the host salmon\u2014even heavily infected fish tend to return to spawn successfully.\nAccording to Dr. Kieser, a lot of work on \"Henneguya salminicola\" was done by scientists at the Pacific Biological Station in Nanaimo in the mid-1980s, in particular, an overview report which states, \"the fish that have the longest fresh water residence time as juveniles have the most noticeable infections. Hence in order of prevalence, coho are most infected followed by sockeye, chinook, chum and pink. As well, the report says, at the time the studies were conducted, stocks from the middle and upper reaches of large river systems in British Columbia such as Fraser, Skeena, Nass and from mainland coastal streams in the southern half of B.C., \"are more likely to have a low prevalence of infection.\" The report also states, \"It should be stressed that \"Henneguya\", economically deleterious though it is, is harmless from the view of public health. It is strictly a fish parasite that cannot live in or affect warm blooded animals, including man\".\nAccording to Klaus Schallie, Molluscan Shellfish Program Specialist with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, \"\"Henneguya salminicola\" is found in southern B.C. also and in all species of salmon. I have previously examined smoked chum salmon sides that were riddled with cysts and some sockeye runs in Barkley Sound (southern B.C., west coast of Vancouver Island) are noted for their high incidence of infestation.\"\nSea lice, particularly \"Lepeophtheirus salmonis\" and various \"Caligus\" species, including \"C. clemensi\" and \"C. rogercresseyi\", can cause deadly infestations of both farm-grown and wild salmon. Sea lice are ectoparasites which feed on mucus, blood, and skin, and migrate and latch onto the skin of wild salmon during free-swimming, planktonic nauplii and copepodid larval stages, which can persist for several days.\nLarge numbers of highly populated, open-net salmon farms\ncan create exceptionally large concentrations of sea lice; when exposed in river estuaries containing large numbers of open-net farms, many young wild salmon are infected, and do not survive as a result. Adult salmon may survive otherwise critical numbers of sea lice, but small, thin-skinned juvenile salmon migrating to sea are highly vulnerable. On the Pacific coast of Canada, the louse-induced mortality of pink salmon in some regions is commonly over 80%.\nEffect of pile driving.\nThe risk of injury caused by underwater pile driving has been studied by Dr. Halvorsen and her co-workers. The study concluded that the fish are at risk of injury if the cumulative sound exposure level exceeds 210 dB relative to 1 \u03bcPa2 s.\nWild fisheries.\nCommercial.\nAs can be seen from the production chart, the global capture reported by different countries to the FAO of commercial wild salmon has remained fairly steady since 1990 at about one million tonnes per year. This is in contrast to farmed salmon (below) which has increased in the same period from about 0.6 million tonnes to well over two million tonnes.\nNearly all captured wild salmon are Pacific salmon. The capture of wild Atlantic salmon has always been relatively small, and has declined steadily since 1990. In 2011 only 2,500 tonnes were reported. In contrast, about half of all farmed salmon are Atlantic salmon.\nRecreational.\nRecreational salmon fishing can be a technically demanding kind of sport fishing, not necessarily intuitive for beginning fishermen. A conflict exists between commercial fishermen and recreational fishermen for the right to salmon stock resources. Commercial fishing in estuaries and coastal areas is often restricted so enough salmon can return to their natal rivers where they can spawn and be available for sport fishing. On parts of the North American West Coast salmon sport fishing has completely replaced inshore commercial salmon fishing. In most cases, the commercial value of a salmon sold as seafood can be several times less than the value attributed to the same fish caught by a sport fisherman. This is \"a powerful economic argument for allocating stock resources preferentially to sport fishing\".\nFarms.\nSalmon aquaculture is a major contributor to the world production of farmed finfish, representing about US$10\u00a0billion annually. Other commonly cultured fish species include tilapia, catfish, sea bass, carp and bream. Salmon farming is significant in Chile, Norway, Scotland, Canada and the Faroe Islands; it is the source for most salmon consumed in the United States and Europe. Atlantic salmon are also, in very small volumes, farmed in Russia and Tasmania, Australia.\nSalmon are carnivorous, and need to be fed meals produced from catching other wild forage fish and other marine organisms. Salmon farming leads to a high demand for wild forage fish. As a predator, salmon require large nutritional intakes of protein, and farmed salmon consume more fish than they generate as a final product. On a dry weight basis, 2\u20134\u00a0kg of wild-caught fish are needed to produce one kilogram of salmon. As the salmon farming industry expands, it requires more forage fish for feed, at a time when 75% of the world's monitored fisheries are already near to or have exceeded their maximum sustainable yield. The industrial-scale extraction of wild forage fish for salmon farming affects the survivability of other wild predatory fish which rely on them for food. Research is ongoing into sustainable and plant-based salmon feeds.\nIntensive salmon farming uses open-net cages, which have low production costs. It has the drawback of allowing disease and sea lice to spread to local wild salmon stocks.\nAnother form of salmon production, which is safer but less controllable, is to raise salmon in hatcheries until they are old enough to become independent. They are released into rivers in an attempt to increase the salmon population. This system is referred to as ranching. It was very common in countries such as Sweden, before the Norwegians developed salmon farming, but is seldom done by private companies. As anyone may catch the salmon when they return to spawn, a company is limited in benefiting financially from their investment.\nBecause of this, the ranching method has mainly been used by various public authorities and non-profit groups, such as the Cook Inlet Aquaculture Association, as a way to increase salmon populations in situations where they have declined due to overharvesting, construction of dams and habitat destruction or fragmentation. Negative consequences to this sort of population manipulation include genetic \"dilution\" of the wild stocks. Many jurisdictions are now beginning to discourage supplemental fish planting in favour of harvest controls, and habitat improvement and protection.\nA variant method of fish stocking, called ocean ranching, is under development in Alaska. There, the young salmon are released into the ocean far from any wild salmon streams. When it is time for them to spawn, they return to where they were released, where fishermen can catch them.\nAn alternative method to hatcheries is to use spawning channels. These are artificial streams, usually parallel to an existing stream, with concrete or rip-rap sides and gravel bottoms. Water from the adjacent stream is piped into the top of the channel, sometimes via a header pond, to settle out sediment. Spawning success is often much better in channels than in adjacent streams due to the control of floods, which in some years can wash out the natural redds. Because of the lack of floods, spawning channels must sometimes be cleaned out to remove accumulated sediment. The same floods that destroy natural redds also clean the regular streams. Spawning channels preserve the natural selection of natural streams, as there is no benefit, as in hatcheries, to use prophylactic chemicals to control diseases.\nFarm-raised salmon are fed the carotenoids astaxanthin and canthaxanthin to match their flesh colour to wild salmon to improve their marketability. Wild salmon get these carotenoids, primarily astaxanthin, from eating shellfish and krill.\nOne proposed alternative to the use of wild-caught fish as feed for the salmon, is the use of soy-based products. This should be better for the local environment of the fish farm, but producing soy beans has a high environmental cost for the producing region. The fish omega-3 fatty acid content would be reduced compared to fish-fed salmon.\nAnother possible alternative is a yeast-based coproduct of bioethanol production, proteinaceous fermentation biomass. Substituting such products for engineered feed can result in equal (sometimes enhanced) growth in fish. With its increasing availability, this would address the problems of rising costs for buying hatchery fish feed.\nYet another attractive alternative is the increased use of seaweed. Seaweed provides essential minerals and vitamins for growing organisms. It offers the advantage of providing natural amounts of dietary fiber and having a lower glycemic load than grain-based fish meal. In the best-case scenario, widespread use of seaweed could yield a future in aquaculture that eliminates the need for land, freshwater, or fertilizer to raise fish.\nManagement.\nSalmon population levels are of concern in the Atlantic and in some parts of the Pacific. The population of wild salmon declined markedly in recent decades, especially North Atlantic populations, which spawn in the waters of western Europe and eastern Canada, and wild salmon in the Snake and Columbia River systems in northwestern United States.\nAlaska fishery stocks are still abundant, and catches have been on the rise in recent decades, after the state initiated limitations in 1972. Some of the most important Alaskan salmon sustainable wild fisheries are located near the Kenai River, Copper River, and in Bristol Bay. Fish farming of Pacific salmon is outlawed in the United States Exclusive Economic Zone, however, there is a substantial network of publicly funded hatcheries, and the State of Alaska's fisheries management system is viewed as a leader in the management of wild fish stocks.\nIn Canada, returning Skeena River wild salmon support commercial, subsistence and recreational fisheries, as well as the area's diverse wildlife on the coast and around communities hundreds of miles inland in the watershed. The status of wild salmon in Washington is mixed. Of 435 wild stocks of salmon and steelhead, only 187 of them were classified as healthy; 113 had an unknown status, one was extinct, 12 were in critical condition and 122 were experiencing depressed populations.\nThe commercial salmon fisheries in California have been either severely curtailed or closed completely in recent years, due to critically low returns on the Klamath and or Sacramento rivers, causing millions of dollars in losses to commercial fishermen. Both Atlantic and Pacific salmon are popular sportfish.\nSalmon populations have been established in all the Great Lakes. Coho stocks were planted by the state of Michigan in the late 1960s to control the growing population of non-native alewife. Now Chinook (king), Atlantic, and coho (silver) salmon are annually stocked in all Great Lakes by most bordering states and provinces. These populations are not self-sustaining and do not provide much in the way of a commercial fishery, but have led to the development of a thriving sport fishery.\nWild, self-sustaining Pacific salmon populations have been established in New Zealand, Chile, and Argentina. They are highly prized by sport fishers, but others worry about displacing native fish species. Also, and especially in Chile (Aquaculture in Chile), both Atlantic and Pacific salmon are used in net pen farming.\nIn 2020 researchers reported widespread declines in the sizes of four species of wild Pacific salmon: Chinook, chum, coho, and sockeye. These declines have been occurring for 30 years, and are thought to be associated with climate change and competition with growing numbers of pink and hatchery salmon.\nAs food.\nSalmon is a popular food fish. Classified as an oily fish, salmon is considered to be healthy due to the fish's high protein, high omega-3 fatty acids, and high vitamin D content. Salmon is also a source of cholesterol, with a range of 23\u2013214\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g depending on the species. According to reports in the journal \"Science\", farmed salmon may contain high levels of dioxins. PCB (polychlorinated biphenyl) levels may be up to eight times higher in farmed salmon than in wild salmon, but still well below levels considered dangerous. Nonetheless, according to a 2006 study published in the \"Journal of the American Medical Association\", the benefits of eating even farmed salmon still outweigh any risks imposed by contaminants. Farmed salmon has a high omega-3 fatty acid content comparable to wild salmon. The type of omega-3 present may not be a factor for other important health functions.\nSalmon flesh is generally orange to red, although white-fleshed wild salmon with white-black skin colour occurs. The natural colour of salmon results from carotenoid pigments, largely astaxanthin, but also canthaxanthin, in the flesh. Wild salmon get these carotenoids from eating krill and other tiny shellfish.\nThe vast majority of Atlantic salmon available in market around the world are farmed (almost 99%), whereas the majority of Pacific salmon are wild-caught (greater than 80%). Canned salmon in the U.S. is usually wild Pacific catch, though some farmed salmon is available in canned form. Smoked salmon is another popular preparation method, and can either be hot- or cold-smoked. Lox can refer to either cold-smoked salmon or salmon cured in a brine solution (also called gravlax). Traditional canned salmon includes some skin (which is harmless) and bone (which adds calcium). Skinless and boneless canned salmon is also available.\nRaw salmon flesh may contain \"Anisakis\" nematodes, marine parasites that cause anisakiasis. Before the availability of refrigeration, the Japanese did not consume raw salmon. Salmon and salmon roe have only recently come into use in making sashimi (raw fish) and sushi.\nTo the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast, salmon is considered a vital part of the diet. Specifically, the indigenous peoples of Haida Gwaii, located near former Queen Charlotte Island in British Columbia, rely on salmon as one of their main sources of food, although many other bands have fished Pacific waters for centuries. Salmon are not only ancient and unique, but it is important because it is expressed in culture, art forms, and ceremonial feasts. Annually, salmon spawn in Haida, feeding on everything on the way upstream and down. Within the Haida nation, salmon is referred to as \"tsiin\", and is prepared in several ways including smoking, baking, frying, and making soup.\nHistorically, there has always been enough salmon, as traditional subsistence fishing methods did not result in overfishing, and people only took what they needed. In 2003, a report on First Nations participation in commercial fisheries, including salmon, commissioned by BC's Ministry of Agriculture and Food found that there were 595 First Nation-owned and operated commercial vessels in the province. Of those vessels, First Nations' members owned 564. However, employment within the industry has decreased overall by 50% in the last decade, with 8,142 registered commercial fishermen in 2003. This has affected employment for many fisherman, who rely on salmon as a source of income.\nBlack bears also rely on salmon as food. The leftovers the bears leave behind are considered important nutrients for the Canadian forest, such as the soil, trees and plants. In this sense, the salmon feed the forest and in return receive clean water and gravel in which to hatch and grow, sheltered from extremes of temperature and water flow in times of high and low rainfall. However, the condition of the salmon in Haida has been affected in recent decades. Due to logging and development, much of the salmon's habitat (i.e., Ain River) has been destroyed, resulting in the fish being close to endangered. For residents, this has resulted in limits on catches, which, in turn, has affected families' diets and cultural events such as feasts. Some of the salmon systems in danger include the Davidon, Naden, Mamim, and Mathers.\nFishing.\nHistory.\nThe salmon has long been at the heart of the culture and livelihood of coastal dwellers, which can be traced as far back as 5,000 years when archeologists discovered Nisqually tribe remnants. The original distribution of the genus \"Oncorhynchus\" covered the Pacific Rim coastline. History shows salmon used tributaries, rivers and estuaries without regard to jurisdiction for 18\u201322 million years. Baseline data is near impossible to recreate based on the inconsistent historical data, but there has been massive depletion since the 1900s. The Pacific Northwest once sprawled with native inhabitants who ensured little degradation was caused by their actions to salmon habitats. As animists, the indigenous people relied not only for salmon for food, but spiritual guidance. The role of the salmon spirit guided the people to respect ecological systems such as the rivers and tributaries the salmon used for spawning. Natives often used the entire fish and left little waste by turning the bladder into glue, and using bones for toys and skin for clothing and shoes. The original salmon ceremony, introduced by indigenous tribes on the Pacific coast, consisted of three major parts. First was the welcoming of the first catch, and then the cooking of it. Finally the bones were returned to the sea to induce hospitality so other salmon would give their lives to the people of that village. \nMany tribes, such as the Yurok, had a taboo against harvesting the first fish that swam upriver in summer, but once they confirmed that the salmon run had returned in abundance they would begin to catch them in plentiful. The indigenous practices were guided by deep ecological wisdom, which was eradicated when Euro-American settlements began to be developed. Salmon have a much grander history than what is presently shown today. The salmon that once dominated the Pacific Ocean are now just a fraction in population and size. The Pacific salmon population is now less than 1\u20133% of what it was when Lewis and Clark arrived at the region. In his 1908 State of the Union address, U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt observed that the fisheries were in significant decline:\n\"The salmon fisheries of the Columbia River are now but a fraction of what they were twenty-five years ago, and what they would be now if the United States Government had taken complete charge of them by intervening between Oregon and Washington. During these twenty-five years the fishermen of each State have naturally tried to take all they could get, and the two legislatures have never been able to agree on joint action of any kind adequate in degree for the protection of the fisheries. At the moment the fishing on the Oregon side is practically closed, while there is no limit on the Washington side of any kind, and no one can tell what the courts will decide as to the very statutes under which this action and non-action result. Meanwhile very few salmon reach the spawning grounds, and probably four years hence the fisheries will amount to nothing; and this comes from a struggle between the associated, or gill-net, fishermen on the one hand, and the owners of the fishing wheels up the river.\"\nOn the Columbia River, the Chief Joseph Dam completed in 1955 completely blocks salmon migration to the upper Columbia River system.\nThe Fraser River salmon population was affected by the 1914 slide caused by the Canadian Pacific Railway at Hells Gate. The 1917 catch was one quarter of the 1913 catch.\nThe origin of the word for \"salmon\" was one of the arguments about the location of the origin of the Indo-European languages.\nMythology.\nThe salmon is an important creature in several strands of Celtic mythology and poetry, which often associated them with wisdom and venerability. In Irish folklore, fishermen associated salmon with fairies and thought it was unlucky to refer to them by name. In Irish mythology, a creature called the Salmon of Knowledge plays a key role in the tale \"The Boyhood Deeds of Fionn\". In the tale, the Salmon will grant powers of knowledge to whoever eats it, and is sought by poet Finn Eces for seven years. Finally Finn Eces catches the fish and gives it to his young pupil, Fionn mac Cumhaill, to prepare it for him. However, Fionn burns his thumb on the salmon's juices, and he instinctively puts it in his mouth. In so doing, he inadvertently gains the Salmon's wisdom. Elsewhere in Irish mythology, the salmon is also one of the incarnations of both Tuan mac Cairill and Fintan mac B\u00f3chra.\nSalmon also feature in Welsh mythology. In the prose tale \"Culhwch and Olwen\", the Salmon of Llyn Llyw is the oldest animal in Britain, and the only creature who knows the location of Mabon ap Modron. After speaking to a string of other ancient animals who do not know his whereabouts, King Arthur's men Cai and Bedwyr are led to the Salmon of Llyn Llyw, who lets them ride its back to the walls of Mabon's prison in Gloucester.\nIn Norse mythology, after Loki tricked the blind god H\u00f6\u00f0r into killing his brother Baldr, Loki jumped into a river and transformed himself into a salmon to escape punishment from the other gods. When they held out a net to trap him he attempted to leap over it but was caught by Thor who grabbed him by the tail with his hand, and this is why the salmon's tail is tapered.\nSalmon are central spiritually and culturally to Native American mythology on the Pacific coast, from the Haida and Coast Salish peoples, to the Nuu-chah-nulth peoples in British Columbia.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was a BAFTA TV Award winner and twice a Laurence Olivier Award winner.\nIn the 1950s, Mitchell appeared on the radio programmes \"Educating Archie\" and \"Hancock's Half Hour\". He also performed minor roles in several films. In the 1960s, he rose to prominence in the role of Alf Garnett in the BBC television sitcom \"Till Death Us Do Part\" (1965\u201375), created by Johnny Speight, which won him a Best TV Actor BAFTA in 1967. He reprised the role in the television sequels \"Till Death...\" (ATV, 1981) and \"In Sickness and in Health\" (BBC, 1985\u201392), and in the films \"Till Death Us Do Part\" (1969) and \"The Alf Garnett Saga\" (1972).\nMitchell's other film appearances include \"Three Crooked Men\" (1958), \"Carry On Cleo\" (1964), \"The Spy Who Came In from the Cold\" (1965), \"The Assassination Bureau\" (1969) and \"Norman Loves Rose\" (1982). He held both British and Australian citizenship and enjoyed considerable success in stage performances in both countries, winning Olivier Awards in 1979 for \"Death of a Salesman\" and in 2004 for \"The Price\".\nEarly life.\nMitchell was born and raised in Stoke Newington, London. His father was a glass and china merchant. His family were Russian Jews (originally called \"Misell\").\nMitchell was interested in acting from an early age and attended Gladys Gordon's Academy of Dramatic Arts in Walthamstow from the age of seven. He did well at Southgate County School (which became Minchenden School), a state grammar school at Palmers Green, North London. He then studied physical chemistry at University College, Oxford, as a Royal Air Force cadet student on a six-month university short course which the armed services sponsored for potential officers. There he met his contemporary, Richard Burton, and together they joined the RAF in October 1944. He completed his navigator training in Canada just as the Second World War ended.\nCareer.\nRichard Burton's description of the acting profession had convinced him that it would be better than completing his chemistry degree and so Mitchell attended RADA for two years, performing in the evening with London's Unity Theatre. After a short stint as a DJ on Radio Luxembourg, in 1951, Mitchell became a versatile professional actor with straight and comedy roles on stage, radio, film and television. His first broadcast was as a regular on the radio show \"Educating Archie\", and this led to appearances in both the radio and television versions of \"Hancock's Half Hour\".\nBy the late 1950s, Mitchell regularly appeared on television. These roles included Sean Connery's trainer in boxing drama \"Requiem for a Heavyweight\" (1957), with Charlie Drake in the sitcom \"Drake's Progress\" (BBC, 1957) and a title role in \"Three 'Tough' Guys\" (ITV, 1957), in which he played a bungling criminal. He also appeared in several episodes of \"Armchair Theatre\". During the first of these, \"Underground\" (1958), one of the lead actors died during the live performance. He also had roles in \"The Avengers\" in addition to many ITC drama series including: \"William Tell\", \"The Four Just Men\", \"Sir Francis Drake\", \"Danger Man\" and as a recurrent guest in \"The Saint\", as in the second episode of the first season, \"The Latin Touch\" in 1962, depicting an Italian taxi driver.\nMitchell's cinema d\u00e9but was in Guy Hamilton's \"Manuela\" (1957), and he began a career of minor roles as sinister foreign agents, assisted by his premature baldness and facility with Eastern European accents. He appeared in \"The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone\" (1961), the Hammer horror \"The Curse of the Werewolf\" (1961), \"Carry On Cleo\" (1964), \"Where Has Poor Mickey Gone?\" (Gerry Levy, 1964), and \"Help!\" (Richard Lester, 1965) and played leads in \"All the Way Up\" (James MacTaggart, 1970), \"The Chain\" (Jack Gold, 1984), \"The Dunera Boys\" (Ben Lewin, 1985) and \"Foreign Body\" (Ronald Neame, 1986).\nIn 1965, Mitchell was cast in the role for which he became best known, as the Conservative-voting, bigoted cockney West Ham United supporter Alf Garnett in a play for the BBC \"Comedy Playhouse\" series, broadcast on 22 July 1965. This was the pilot edition of the long-running series \"Till Death Us Do Part\", with Gretchen Franklin, Una Stubbs and Anthony Booth. The part of Mum, played by Franklin, was recast with Dandy Nichols in the role when the programme was commissioned as a series. Mitchell's real life persona was different from Alf Garnett, being Jewish, Labour-voting and a staunch supporter of Tottenham Hotspur. The show ran from 1966 to 1975, in seven series, making a total of 53 30-minute episodes. While the series aimed to satirise racism, it actually also gained the support of many bigoted racists who perceived Alf as \"the voice of reason\".\nMitchell reprised the role of Alf Garnett in the films \"Till Death Us Do Part\" (1969) and \"The Alf Garnett Saga\" (1972), in the ATV series \"Till Death...\" (1981), and in the BBC series \"In Sickness and in Health\" (1985\u201392). He also reprised his role as Alf Garnett in 1983 in the television series \"The Main Attraction\" where comedians recreated their famous acts from their past in front of a live and television audience (similar to \"An Audience with...\" that began in 1976). In 1997 he played the role in \"An Audience with Alf Garnett\". The same year, ITV aired a series of mini-episodes called \"A Word With Alf\", featuring Alf and his friends. All the TV shows and both films were written by Johnny Speight. When Speight died in 1998, the character of Alf Garnett was retired at Mitchell's request.\nMitchell had a long and distinguished career on stage and television. Other small screen roles included a 13-episode series, \"Men of Affairs\" with Brian Rix (ITV, 1973\u201374), based on the West End hit farce \"Don't Just Lie There, Say Something!\" There were also performances in 1975 in \"Play for Today\" (showing that he could play a serious character role in the episode, \"Moss\"), as William Wardle, a crooked accountant in \"The Sweeney\" episode \"Big Spender\" (Thames Television for ITV, 1978), \"Lovejoy\" (BBC), \"Waking the Dead\" (BBC), \"Kavanagh QC\" (Central Television for ITV, he played a concentration camp survivor in the episode \"Ancient History\"), as Shylock in \"The Merchant of Venice\" (BBC, 1980) and \"Gormenghast\" (BBC, 2000). In 1991 he starred as Ivan Fox, a Jewish atheist from London living in Belfast in \"So You Think You've Got Troubles\", a BBC One comedy series written by Maurice Gran and Laurence Marks.\nIn 2001, Mitchell appeared in a Christmas Special episode of \"Last of the Summer Wine\", \"Potts in Pole Position\".\nMitchell was a subject of the television programme \"This Is Your Life\" in 1972 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews.\nOn stage, Mitchell received extensive critical acclaim for his performances as Willy Loman in Arthur Miller's \"Death of a Salesman\" at the National Theatre directed by Michael Rudman (1979, being originally cast in the role by Stephen Barry at the Playhouse in Perth, Australia); Harold Pinter's \"The Caretaker\" at the National Theatre; Pinter's \"The Homecoming\" at London's Comedy Theatre (1991), King Lear at the then West Yorkshire Playhouse directed by Jude Kelly in 1995 and Miller's \"The Price\" at the Apollo Theatre in 2003.\nMitchell had a number of musical roles in his lengthy career, beginning with the role of Theophile in the original London production of \"Can-Can\" and the small role of Crookfinger Jake in \"The Threepenny Opera\". He also sang briefly in the film \"Till Death Do Us Part\" and played Alfred Doolittle on the studio album of \"My Fair Lady\", Music Hall Songs, songs of the First World War, and other recordings such as \"The Writing's on the Wall\", from 1967, on CBS, all in the Alf Garnett persona, were released in LP and 45 rpm single form, too, in Britain and Australia.\nIn 2008, at the age of 82, Mitchell was performing alongside Ross Gardiner at the Trafalgar Studios, in London's West End, as a retired dry-cleaner in Jeff Baron's portrait of Jewish-American life \"Visiting Mr. Green\".\nAwards.\nIn 1976, Mitchell's one-man show \"The Thoughts of Chairman Alf\" won the \"Evening Standard\" Theatre Award for best comedy in London's West End. In 1982, he received an Australian Film Institute Award for best supporting actor in the film \"Norman Loves Rose\". He received two Laurence Olivier Theatre Awards: for playing Willy Loman in Arthur Miller's \"Death of a Salesman\" (National Theatre, 1979) and as best supporting actor in a 2003 performance of \"The Price\", also by Miller. His role in \"Death of a Salesman\" also won him an \"Evening Standard Theatre Award for Best Actor\" and was highly praised by Peter Hall. Miller reportedly described Mitchell's performance as \"one of the best interpretations of the part he had ever seen.\"\nPersonal life and death.\nMitchell described himself in an interview as an atheist, but also stated that he \"enjoy[ed] being Jewish\". He was a patron of the British Humanist Association. In 1951, he married Constance Wake, an actress who appeared in early 1960s television dramas such as \"Maigret\". They had three children.\nFor over 20 years, Mitchell suffered pain from nerve damage, caused by transverse myelitis, and was a supporter of the Neuropathy Trust. He suffered a mild stroke in August 2004. He was back on stage a week later, reprising his lauded role as a cantankerous old Jew in Arthur Miller's \"The Price\".\nIn sharp contrast to his signature Alf Garnett character, who was a staunch Conservative, Mitchell was a socialist and Labour Party supporter. He believed that the 2010 Labour Party leadership election had a lack of firebrands.\nMitchell died aged 89, at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, London, on 14 November 2015, following a long illness.\nSelected filmography.\nFilms.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTelevision.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "36986", "revid": "35206277", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36986", "title": "Till Death Us Do Part", "text": "British television sitcom (1965\u20131975)\n \nTill Death Us Do Part is a British television sitcom that aired on BBC1 from 1965 to 1975. The show was first broadcast in 1965 as a \"Comedy Playhouse\" pilot, then as seven series between 1966 and 1975. In 1981, ITV continued the sitcom for six episodes, calling it \"Till Death...\". The BBC produced a sequel from 1985 until 1992, \"In Sickness and in Health\".\nCreated by Johnny Speight, \"Till Death Us Do Part\" centred on the East End Garnett family, led by patriarch Alf Garnett (Warren Mitchell), a reactionary white working-class man who holds racist and anti-socialist views. His long-suffering wife Else was played by Dandy Nichols, and his daughter Rita by Una Stubbs. Rita's husband Mike Rawlins (Anthony Booth) is a socialist \"layabout\" from Liverpool who frequently locks horns with Garnett. Alf Garnett became a well-known character in British culture, and Mitchell played him on stage and television until Speight's death in 1998.\nIn addition to the spin-off \"In Sickness and in Health\", \"Till Death Us Do Part\" was remade in several countries including Germany (\"Ein Herz und eine Seele\"), and the Netherlands (as \"Tot de dood ons scheidt\") in 1969 and as \"Met goed fatsoen\" in 1975, the latter was never broadcast; \"In Sickness and in Health\" was adapted as \"In voor- en tegenspoed\" in 1991\u20131997). It is also the show that inspired \"All in the Family\" in the United States, which, in turn, inspired the Brazilian \"A Grande Fam\u00edlia\". Many episodes from the first three series are thought no longer to exist, having been destroyed in the late 1960s and early 1970s as was the policy at the time.\nIn 2000, the show was ranked number 88 on the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes list compiled by the British Film Institute. The title is a reference to the Marriage Liturgy from the \"Book of Common Prayer\".\nSeries.\nSuccess years.\nThe series became an instant hit because, although a comedy, it dealt with aspects of working-class life comparatively realistically and in the context of its time. It addressed racial and political issues that had been becoming increasingly prevalent in British society. Mitchell imbued the character of Alf Garnett with an earthy charm that served to humanise Alf and make him likeable. According to interviews he gave, the fact that some viewers overlooked Alf's racist views and regarded him as a \"rough diamond\" disappointed Speight.\nThe show captured a key feature of Britain in the 1960s \u2013 the public perception that the generation gap was widening. Alf, and to a lesser degree his wife, represented the old guard, the traditional and conservative attitudes of the older generation. Alf's battles with his left-wing son-in-law were not just ideological but generational and cultural. His son-in-law and daughter represented the younger generation. They supported the aspects of the new era, such as relaxed sexual norms, as well as new fashions and styles of music. The same things were anathema to Alf and in his opinion indicative of everything that was wrong with the younger generation and the liberal attitudes they embraced.\nAlf was portrayed as the archetypal working-class Conservative. His two primary passions were football and politics, though his actual knowledge of either was limited. He used language considered unacceptable for television in the 1960s. He often referred to racial minorities as \"coons\" and similar terms. He referred to his Liverpudlian son-in-law as \"Shirley Temple\" or a \"randy Scouse git\" (a phrase that caught the ear of Micky Dolenz of the Monkees, who heard it while on tour in the UK and used it as the title of the group's next single \u2013 though their record label renamed it \"Alternate Title\" in the UK market to avoid controversy), and to his wife as a \"silly [old] moo\" (a substitute for \"cow\" which was vetoed by the BBC's head of comedy Frank Muir). However, Michael Palin writes in his diary for 16 July 1976 that Warren Mitchell told him that \"silly moo\" was not scripted: \"It came out during a rehearsal when he forgot the line 'Silly old mare'.\" Controversially, the show was one of the earliest mainstream programmes to feature the swear word \"bloody\". The show was one of many held up by Mary Whitehouse as an example of the BBC's \"moral laxity\".\nIn a demonstration of Speight's satirical skills \u2013 after a successful libel action brought against Speight by Whitehouse \u2013 he created an episode, first broadcast on 27 February 1967, in which Alf Garnett is depicted as an admirer of Whitehouse. Garnett was seen proudly reading her first book. \"What are you reading?\" his son-in-law asks. When he relates that it is Mary Whitehouse, his son-in-law sniggers. Alf's response is \"She's concerned for the bleedin' moral fibre of the nation!\" The episode ends with the book being burnt.\nUltimately \"silly moo\" became a comic catchphrase. Another Garnett phrase was \"it stands to reason\", usually before making some patently unreasonable comment. Alf was portrayed as an admirer of Enoch Powell, a right-wing Conservative politician known particularly for his strong opposition to the immigration of people from non-white countries. Alf was also a supporter of West Ham United (a football club based in the East End) and known to make derogatory remarks about \"the Jews up at Spurs\" (referring to Tottenham Hotspur, a north London club with a sizeable Jewish following). This was a playful touch by Speight, as Warren Mitchell was both Jewish and a Tottenham Hotspur supporter.\nIn interviews, Speight explained he had originally based Alf on his father, an East End docker who was staunchly reactionary and held \"unenlightened\" attitudes toward black people. Speight made clear that he regretted that his father held such attitudes, which Speight regarded as reprehensible. Speight saw the show as a way of ridiculing such views and dealing with his complex feelings about his father.\nHowever, it was later claimed in the book about the series, \"A Family at War\" by Mark Ward, that the only similarities between Alf and Speight's father were that his father was a hard-working, working-class East End docker and manual labourer who voted Conservative, revered traditional British values, and was very polite to everyone he met, no matter their background. It is claimed that Speight picked up the idea for Alf's bigoted personality from railway station porters he met when he had worked in temporary jobs for British Rail in the London area. The political views of both Alf and Mike were reflective of Speight's own perception of people both on the left and the right, with the ignorance and bigotry of those on the right represented by Alf and the idealism of many sections of the left represented by Mike.\nOriginal decline.\nJohnny Speight gained a reputation for late delivery of scripts, sometimes unfinished and still in the form of rough notes (which would be finished and finalised as a script by the script editor and cast during rehearsals), either close to, on, or occasionally past the deadline. This was claimed by Speight to ensure maximum topicality for the series, although this was disputed by the programme's first producer, Dennis Main Wilson, who stated that Speight was frequently found late at night in a regular selection of West End bars, and that on more than one occasion the writer had to be physically dragged out of such establishments by Wilson and driven home to get the scripts typed up and finished.\nThis was the reason for the second series consisting of ten episodes rather than the commissioned thirteen. As three scripts that were scheduled to be recorded and broadcast towards the end of that series were not ready and actors, crew and Speight had already been paid in advance for thirteen episodes, it was decided that an Easter Monday bank holiday special \u2013 \"Till Closing Time Us Do Part\" \u2013 would be made and that this would mostly be made up of the cast and crew ad-libbing within the broad confines of a plot. For accounting reasons, this would be considered an 11th episode of the second series. At double the usual length, it also made up for screen time of a 12th episode. The addition of this episode meant that only one week's worth of pay was wasted, rather than three. Normally, a sitcom would have plenty of time (ranging from several weeks to several months) between recording and transmission to iron out any such script delivery problems. However, to ensure maximum topicality, most episodes of the second series of \"Till Death Us Do Part\" were recorded less than seven days before their intended transmission date, and as all studios would be booked on other nights for other \u2013 sometimes more important \u2013 productions, this meant that the recording of \"Till Death Us Do Part\" episodes could not be moved to another night or another studio should the script not be ready in time for rehearsals or recording. Should this happen (which it did towards the end of the second series), this would mean no episode ready for transmission that week and, because of the very short gap between recording and transmission and lack of unbroadcast episodes to replace them, other programmes had to be used to fill in the schedule in the last three planned weeks of the second series' thirteen-episode run. It is because of these problems of topicality delaying (sometimes cancelling) scripts that the third series is noticeably less topical than the second and had some weeks between recording and transmission to act as a \"cushion\" to ensure continuity of the series should one or more episodes fall through.\nThe late delivery of scripts had been a problem that had first reared its head during production of the first series. The second series got off to a good start in this respect with the first four scripts being delivered ahead of the deadline, but it became clear as that series wore on that Speight was having these problems again. Amongst a myriad of other problems (detailed below), the final straw for the original run appears to have been a script in the final (third) series of eight episodes not being delivered in time for rehearsals to begin and thus losing one episode. This confirmed to the BBC their suspicions that Speight was not an ideal writer to be writing for a topical sitcom.\nTo combat these problems, it was suggested by the production team that there be \"windows\" or \"spaces\" within the script that could easily be excised and replaced with more topical jokes (a frequent tactic used in other topical sitcoms like Yorkshire Television's \"The New Statesman\" twenty years later), a suggestion that was initially refused by Speight in the 1960s run of the series but which was taken up during the 1970s run. This came to be particularly useful to ensure maximum topicality during the 1974 series, some episodes of which reflected and satirised the UK miners' strike and the Three-Day Week. However, Speight's initial refusal to accept these suggestions, combined with his constant demands of pay increases (eventually becoming the highest-paid comedy writer and then \u2013 after another increase \u2013 the highest-paid TV writer, during a time of strict public-sector pay restraints imposed by the Labour government of Harold Wilson, which was a source of particular embarrassment to the BBC) and the increasing clashes he and the BBC were having with Mary Whitehouse, came to a head. Over time, Mary Whitehouse and the National Viewers' and Listeners' Association (NVLA) had several court cases with the BBC directly or indirectly related to the series, some of which Whitehouse or the NVLA won. During the first two series, the programme was originally broadcast on weeknights in a 7:30pm timeslot, before the post-9pm \"watershed\", and both Whitehouse and Speight campaigned for such a change in scheduling, the only aspect of the programme that they agreed upon. The reluctance of the BBC to reschedule the series at first can possibly be explained in the fact that the \"watershed\" was a relatively new phenomenon at the time and there was no consensus between the BBC and the ITA over what should and should not constitute family-friendly broadcasting, nor when this \"watershed\" should start, the responsibility over what constituted family-friendly viewing being primarily placed with the child's parents.\nPublic outcry over the episode \"The Blood Donor\" as being a particularly distasteful episode and a new Chairman of the BBC Board of Governors \u2013 Lord Hill (who had been appointed as Lord Normanbrook's successor when Normanbrook died suddenly in June 1967) \u2013 taking a rather different, more conservative approach to the running of the BBC than the liberal and laid-back attitude of his predecessor, were two other factors that turned up the heat of criticism against the series. Lord Hill had previously been the chairman of the Independent Television Authority and ensured that the ITV network remained relatively controversy-free. He shared many of the same opinions as Whitehouse and the wider NVLA, which also clashed with the opinions of the then BBC Director General, Hugh Carleton Greene (he is quoted as having the \"utmost contempt\" for Hill), who had been the series' biggest champion and gleefully ignored Whitehouse whenever he had to. Many other members of BBC management also voiced their opinions directly to Hill over his appointment, most notably the then Controller of BBC2, David Attenborough, who compared Hill being Chairman of the BBC Board of Governors to \"giving Rommel the command of the Eighth Army\". Neither Hill nor his predecessor, Normanbrook, had any direct influence over the series itself (as the BBC Charter prohibits this), but their relationship with the Director-General indirectly influenced the programme. Because of his total personality and culture clash with Hill, Greene resigned in July 1968 (soon after the series ended its original run) and, with the series' biggest champion now out of the BBC, it looked like the show would be cancelled. Another champion of the series \u2013 Head of Comedy output at the BBC, Frank Muir had resigned his post between the second and third series to take up a new, similar, post at David Frost's fledgling new ITV franchise London Weekend Television, which would launch on 2 August 1968. His replacement, Michael Mills, recognised that the series had enormous potential but did not understand why it had to be so topical, controversial or full of swearing and blasphemy, which hugely irritated Speight.\nThe final straw for the BBC at this time came when a script for the third series, which was intended to be made up of eight episodes, was so late that it missed the scheduled beginning of rehearsals. This episode was intended to be between the fourth and fifth episodes, putting a break in the recording dates and leading to one week's less space between recording and transmission of episodes.\nGiven the problems the series had given the BBC with steep pay increases in the midst of a government-imposed public sector pay freeze, scripts being delivered in varying degrees of completeness (and sometimes not at all), several court cases (usually libel or blasphemy), hundreds of complaints, several run-ins with Mary Whitehouse and the NVLA, the loss of the series' two biggest champions (first Frank Muir, then Hugh Carleton Greene), the new management having different opinions over the programme and the general stress its production placed on staff (primarily down to the incomplete scripts submitted by Speight), all despite its ratings success over ITV (particularly over \"Coronation Street\") in its first two series and its general popularity as a whole, contributed to the BBC getting cold feet over the programme. A planned fourth series, scheduled for autumn 1968, was scrapped.\nRevival.\nThe programme was revived in 1972, during a time when the BBC were reviving some of their more successful sitcoms from the 1960s for colour production (\"Steptoe and Son\" being an example). A contributory factor to this decision may have been that, since the ITV franchise changes of the summer of 1968, ITV had paid a lot more attention to making sitcoms, particularly those featuring, and appealing to, the working class, which had previously been the preserve of the BBC during the 1960s. This can be attributed as a direct effect of the popularity of \"Till Death Us Do Part\", \"The Likely Lads\" and \"Steptoe and Son\", which were the first sitcoms to truly depict the realities of working-class life in Britain and were not set in typical \"middle-class sitcom suburbia\". In amongst these programmes, \"Till Death Us Do Part\" would not look as out of place as it did in the late 1960s, particularly now as the show would be less topical (bar some 1974 episodes) but no less political or controversial, as it had originally been. This was of great help to Speight, as it now meant that he did not have to wait until the very last minute to submit completed or half-completed scripts.\nSecond decline.\nHowever, this was also the series' downfall, as viewers noted the increasingly less-topical plots and the satire was much less vicious than it had been in the 1960s, with the style of the series in both 1975 series bearing little semblance to those transmitted in the late 1960s. Speight has put this down not only to reducing the pressures of working on a topical sitcom but also to his own personal declining interest in politics, which may be an explanation of why \"In Sickness and In Health\" was much less political, and not as vicious as its predecessor could be.\nAdditionally, towards the end of the series Dandy Nichols fell ill and was unable to attend the live-audience recordings. So, in a later episode Else was seen leaving for Australia, to Alf's dismay. Her scenes were recorded separately from the rest of the episodes. The plan was for Nichols to tape scenes from time to time set in Australia where she would phone Alf or Rita in short segments, but only one episode featured such a scene and the idea was dropped due to Nichols' poor health.\nPatricia Hayes, who had been seen from time to time previously as next-door neighbour Min, became a starring character along with her husband Bert, previously played by Bill Maynard and now by Alfie Bass. The show's ratings began to suffer and when it was clear Nichols was not returning as hoped by the writer, in 1975, the series was cancelled. The final episode saw Alf lose his job and receive a telegram from Else asking for a divorce.\nProduction.\nAs with most BBC sitcoms \"Till Death Us Do Part\" was recorded before a live studio audience. The programmes were recorded onto two-inch quadruplex videotape. From 1966 to 1968, the show was transmitted in black and white. When the series returned in 1972, it was transmitted in colour. The opening titles/end credits of the first colour episodes originally used the black-and-white sequence from the 1960s tinted in red, as seen on UKTV Gold repeats in 2006.\nThe house seen in the opening and closing titles to the 1960s episodes was located on Garnet Street in Wapping (from where writer Johnny Speight took the Garnett family name). This terrace was demolished in June 1968 for road widening (which is why the street used in the 1969 film and the opening titles to the colour episodes do not match with the houses used in the original opening sequence). Subsequent to this, in the 1980s, a terrace of newer multicoloured homes and an estate agents took the places of the terraced estate. They are located on Garnet Street in close proximity to the local Wallace James shop, St Peter's Primary School, Gastronomica bar, Docklands General Store and Crane Wharf.\nMissing black and white episodes.\nSome of the show's 26 episodes from series 1\u20133 that were videotaped in black and white and broadcast between 1965 and 1968 no longer exist; they were wiped by the BBC during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Currently, most material from thirteen episodes still survives, with one episode on the original tape and the rest on film or domestic formats. The surviving 1960s B&amp;W episodes are: \"Arguments, Arguments\"; \"A House With Love in It\"; \"Intolerance\"; \"Peace &amp; Goodwill\"; \"Sex Before Marriage\"; \"In Sickness and in Health\"; \"State Visit\"; \"Alf's Dilemma\"; \"Till Closing Time Do Us Part\"; \"The Phone\"; \"The Blood Donor\"; \"Monopoly\" and \"Aunt Maud\". Sequences exist from: the pilot episode; \"The Bulldog Breed\"; \"A Wapping Mythology (The Workers' King)\"; and \"The Puppy\".\nThe public appeal campaign, the BBC Archive Treasure Hunt, continues to search for lost episodes. In 1997, the long-lost episode \"Alf's Dilemma\" was found in a private collection on a 21-minute 16mm telerecording. This is the episode featuring Garnett reading Mary Whitehouse's first book. The episode was rebroadcast in 1998 on UK Gold.\nIn 2001, two episodes from Series 3 were recovered, \"The Phone\" and \"Aunt Maud\". Both were taken from off air recordings on a Philips EL3400 open reel videotape by Martin Loach, the latter episode was missing the first two minutes.\nIn August 2009, two more black and white episodes, \"In Sickness and in Health\" and \"State Visit\", were returned by a film collector.\nThe episode \"Intolerance\" was recovered in August 2016. It was screened at the BFI's annual \"Missing Believed Wiped\" event on Saturday 16 December 2016 at their Southbank venue. Network's late 2016 complete DVD box set contains off-air audio recordings of what was then every missing episode. In autumn 2017, a copy of \"Sex Before Marriage\" was recovered.\n\"Till Death Us Do Part\" started airing on That's TV on 4 September 2022, as part of a nightly BBC sitcom double bill with \"The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin\", with four 'lost episodes' (\"Intolerance\", \"In Sickness and In Health\", \"State Visit\" and \"The Phone\") included as part of the run by the channel.\nIn October 2023, Kaleidoscope announced the discovery of the previously lost episode \"Monopoly\" which was recorded on a domestic 405 line reel to reel tape format, which was donated to the organisation by a member of the cast in 2018. Two further copies of previously recovered episodes were also discovered, including another copy of the episode \"The Phone\" and a complete copy of \"Aunt Maud\" which previously existed incomplete.\nControversy.\nAlthough Speight said he wrote the series to challenge racism, some critics believed that many people watched it because they agreed with Garnett's views. Anthony Clark of Screenonline stated, \"Sadly, Speight's defence was far from watertight\u2014having a white actor, Spike Milligan, black up and don a turban in one episode is clearly questionable\", and added that \"In \"Till Death Us Do Part\", Alf's lengthy rants go largely unchallenged; his wife does little more than raise an eyebrow, while the responses from daughter Rita and the wholly unsympathetic Mike are often little more than impotent quips or frustrated laughter.\" John Cleese, who was himself accused of making racist remarks, defended the series in 2020, saying \"We laughed at Alf's reactionary views. Thus, we discredited them, by laughing at him. Of course, there were people\u2014very stupid people\u2014who said, 'Thank God someone is saying these things at last'. We laughed at these people too.\"\nThe linguist Alan Crosby has argued that the constant use of the phrase \"Scouse git\" with reference to Anthony Booth's character spread both the word \"Scouse\" and negative stereotypes of Liverpudlians.[]\nSequels.\nIn 1980, the ITV company ATV picked up the series and produced a solo show starring Alf, titled \"The Thoughts of Chairman Alf at Christmas\", transmitted on 26 December. The master copy has been wiped; however, a home video recording is currently available to view at the National Media Museum in Bradford.\nIn 1981, ATV made six episodes under the title \"Till Death...\". The series had Alf and Else sharing a bungalow with Min (Patricia Hayes) in Eastbourne following the death of her husband Bert (Alfie Bass). Although Rita remained in the cast, Anthony Booth declined to return. Rita's son Michael was now a teenager and a punk rocker (even though he was born in 1972 and therefore should only have been about nine or ten). The series was not a success and when ATV was restructured as Central Television in 1982, \"Till Death...\" was not recommissioned.\nAlf Garnett returned to the BBC in 1985 for \"In Sickness and in Health\". This took Alf and Else, who was now in a wheelchair, onward into old age, and some of Alf's more extreme opinions were shown to have mellowed. Una Stubbs made some guest appearances, but Anthony Booth was not interested in reprising his role. Eventually, Mike and Rita divorced, and Rita began dating a doctor. After the first series, Dandy Nichols died, and subsequent episodes showed Alf having to deal with life as a widower.\nThe loss of Else (and later, Rita) as regulars in the cast meant that new characters had to be brought in as antagonists for Alf. These notably included his home help, Winston (played by Eamonn Walker), who was both black and gay, and Alf's prim upstairs neighbour, Mrs. Hollingbery (played by Carmel McSharry), who eventually agreed to marry Alf.\nIn 1988, Speight was warned about the use of racist language; after discussion, it was decided that Alf's racist language was to be discontinued and the character of Winston was to be written out. With such improvements helping to update the basic concept, \"In Sickness and in Health\" ran until 1992.\nWarren Mitchell also appeared solo on stage and TV as Alf Garnett, dispensing variations on Alf's homespun reactionary philosophy and singing old music hall songs, most notably in the London Weekend Television show \"An Audience with Alf Garnett\".\nAfter Johnny Speight's death in July 1998, Mitchell decided to retire the character of Alf Garnett.\nCast.\nIn the \"Comedy Playhouse\" pilot, Alf's family name was Ramsey, but the BBC changed his name to Garnett for the subsequent series, to avoid confusion with the England football manager at the time.\nFilm adaptations.\nTwo feature films were made based on the series \u2013 the first was \"Till Death Us Do Part\" (1969), whose first half dealt with the younger Alf and Else during World War II, and whose second half dealt with all the Garnetts in the present day being moved from their East End slum to the new town of Hemel Hempstead, and the adjustments and changes that brought on the family. It gave a nuanced glimpse of British life at the time. The second film, \"The Alf Garnett Saga\" (1972), had Adrienne Posta playing the part of Rita and Paul Angelis playing Mike. It is notable for featuring Alf Garnett on an LSD trip.\nDVD releases.\nIn the UK, Network previously released the first two colour series (4 and 5) on DVD, but these releases are now discontinued, as the licence has since expired, and rights have reverted to BBC Worldwide, who release their titles through 2 Entertain. On 5 December 2016, Network, under licence with BBC Worldwide and 2 Entertain, released the whole colour series (4 to 7), along with every surviving episode from the black-&amp;-white series (1 to 3) and off-air remastered audio recordings of all lost episodes, on DVD as an eight-disc box-set included with a detailed booklet which includes black-and-white and colour photographs, a \"story of\" and a full list of episode synopses. The episode \"Sex Before Marriage\", recovered in 2017, was included as an extra on Network's 2019 release of the first film on both DVD and Blu-Ray.\nThe fourth series was available in the United States and Canada, having been released before the Network edition and featuring some title sequence variations. The 1969 movie is available in both the UK and the US, but the 1972 movie is only available on DVD via bootlegs.\nAll six series and the Christmas specials of \"In Sickness and in Health\" have been released on DVD by 2 Entertain.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "36987", "revid": "69423", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36987", "title": "Today's New International Version", "text": "Updated translation of the Bible\nToday's New International Version (TNIV) is an English translation of the Bible which was developed by the International Bible Society based on the previous New International Version (NIV) originally published in 1978. It is explicitly Protestant like its predecessor; the deuterocanonical books are not part of this translation. The TNIV New Testament was published in March 2002. The complete Bible was published in February 2005. The rights to the text are owned by Biblica (formerly the International Bible Society). Zondervan published the TNIV in North America. Hodder &amp; Stoughton published the TNIV in Europe.\nA team of 13 translators worked on the translation, with forty additional scholars reviewing the translation work. The team was designed to be cross-denominational.\nIn 2011, sales of both the 1984 edition of the NIV and the TNIV were discontinued, following the release of a revised and updated version of the NIV.\nTranslation philosophy.\nThe translation took more than a decade to complete; 13 evangelical scholars worked on the translation: Ronald F. Youngblood, Kenneth L. Barker, John H. Stek, Donald H. Madvig, R. T. France, Gordon Fee, Karen H. Jobes, Walter Liefeld, Douglas J. Moo, Bruce K. Waltke, Larry L. Walker, Herbert M. Wolf and Martin Selman. Forty other scholars, many of them experts on specific books of the Bible, reviewed the translation teams' work. They came from a range of Evangelical denominational backgrounds.\nThe intent of the TNIV translators was to produce an accurate and readable translation in contemporary English. The Committee on Bible Translation wanted to build a new version on the heritage of the NIV and, like its predecessor, create a balanced mediating version\u2013one that would fall in-between the most literal translation and the most free; between word-for-word (Formal Equivalence) and thought-for-thought (Dynamic Equivalence).\nFor translation a wide range of manuscripts were reviewed. The Masoretic Text, the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Greek Septuagint or (LXX), the Aquila, Symmachus and Theodotion, the Latin Vulgate, the Syriac Peshitta, the Aramaic Targums, and for the Psalms the Juxta Hebraica of Jerome were all consulted for the Old Testament. The Dead Sea Scrolls were occasionally followed where the Masoretic Text seemed inconsistent. The United Bible Societies Nestle-Aland Greek New Testament text was used for the New Testament.\nDifferences.\nApproximately 7% of the text was changed from the most recent (1984) version of the NIV. According to Craig Blomberg the TNIV moves in a \"more literal direction three times more often than not\". Mark L. Strauss has stated that the majority of changes are \"based on advances in biblical scholarship, linguistics, and archaeology\".\nIn Matthew 1:18, where the NIV says that Mary was \"with child\", the TNIV simply says Mary was \"pregnant\".\nIn Luke 12:38, the phrase \"second or third watch of the night\" employed in the NIV is changed to \"middle of the night or toward daybreak\" in the TNIV.\nThe TNIV translators have, at times, opted for more traditional Anglo-Saxon or poetic renderings than those found in the NIV. For example, \"the heavens\" is sometimes chosen to replace \"the sky\", as is the case in Isaiah 50:3: \"I clothe the heavens with darkness and make sackcloth its covering\".\nAt times the TNIV offers a different or nuanced understanding of a passage. For example, in the NIV, Psalm 26:3 reads, \"For your love is ever before me, / and I walk continually in your truth\". The TNIV reads, \"For I have always been mindful of your unfailing love / and have lived in reliance on your faithfulness\". There are several changes in this one verse, but of special note is the TNIV's translation of the Hebrew word \"\u2019emet\". The TNIV translators took this word to mean more than simple honesty in Psalm 26:3, referring more specifically to reliability or trustworthiness.\nExamples of other changes are \"truly I tell you\" becomes \"I tell you the truth;\" \"fellow workers\" become \"coworkers;\" \"the Jews\", particularly in John's Gospel, often becomes \"Jewish leaders\" when the context makes the statement's real meaning apparent; and \"miracles\", especially in John, become the more literal \"signs\", \"miraculous signs\", or \"works\". The word for \"Spirit\", where there is a good chance it means the Holy Spirit, is now capitalized. \"Peter\" is now rendered \"Cephas\" when the Greek merely transliterates the Hebrew name.\nOther notable changes are that \"Christ\" has regularly been rendered as \"Messiah\", and \"saints\" has often been replaced with terms such as \"God's people\" or \"believers\".\nGender language and the TNIV.\nAmong other differences from the NIV, the TNIV uses gender-neutral language to refer to people. Two examples of this kind of translation decision are found in Genesis and Matthew:\nGenesis 1:27 reads, \"So God created human beings in his own image.\" Older translations use the word \"man\" to translate the word (\"\u2019adam\") employed in the Hebrew language, the same word used as the proper name of the first man married to the first woman, Eve.\nMatthew 5:9 reads: \"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.\" Here, the Greek word \"huioi\" is translated \"children\" rather than \"sons\" as found in other modern English translations such as the Revised Standard Version, New American Standard Bible, New King James Version, and the Amplified Bible.\nHowever, the 1611 Authorized King James Version also renders this passage as \"children\" rather than \"sons.\" Masculine references to God, such as \"Father\" and \"Son,\" are not modified from the literal translation in the TNIV.\nUnder 30% of the changes in the TNIV involve the use of inclusive language.\nThe TNIV's approach to gender inclusive language is similar to the New International Version Inclusive Language Edition, New Revised Standard Version, the New Living Translation, the New Century Version, and the Contemporary English Version.\nThe TNIV and (\").\nIn the TNIV some original Greek text references to (transliterated \"), are changed from the original English translation of \"the Jews\" to \"Jewish leaders\" or simply \"they\" (such as in John 18:36). This change has been called for by Jewish leaders as a way of avoiding misunderstanding in the Gospel of John.\nA number of evangelical scholars agree with this change. The TNIV is not alone among English Bible versions in following recent biblical scholarship on this matter.\nSupporters.\nDenominations supportive of the TNIV include the Christian Reformed Church (CRC), which officially endorsed the TNIV as an acceptable translation for use, the Evangelical Covenant Church and the Free Methodist Church of North America. Scholars from the Free Methodist Church of North America had a varied response from it \"constitutes no threat\" to \"most accurate ever.\"\nEvangelical scholars and pastoral leaders supporting the project include Mark L. Strauss, Tremper Longman, John Ortberg, Adam Hamilton, Craig Blomberg, Darrell Bock, Don Carson, Peter Furler, Bill Hybels, Ben Witherington III, Lee Strobel, Philip Yancey, Dan Kimball, Terri Blackstock, Erwin McManus, Ted Haggard and others.\nCritics.\nIn June 2002, over 100 evangelical leaders signed a 'Statement of Concern' opposing the TNIV. The Presbyterian Church in America and the Southern Baptist Convention passed resolutions opposing the TNIV and other inclusive-language translations.\nEvangelical scholars and various public figures critical of inclusive-language translations include John F. MacArthur, J. I. Packer, Jack T. Chick, Gail Riplinger, James Dobson, Jerry Falwell, Texe Marrs, Wayne Grudem, Peter Ruckman, D. James Kennedy, Josh McDowell, R. Albert Mohler, Jr., John Piper, Pat Robertson, R.C. Sproul, and Joni Eareckson Tada.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the county town of Cambridgeshire and is located on the River Cam, north of London. As of the 2021 United Kingdom census, the population of the City of Cambridge was 145,700; the population of the wider built-up area (which extends outside the city council area) was 181,137. There is archaeological evidence of settlement in the area as early as the Bronze Age, and Cambridge became an important trading centre during the Roman and Viking eras. The first town charters were granted in the 12th century, although modern city status was not officially conferred until 1951.\nThe city is well known as the home of the University of Cambridge, which was founded in 1209 and consistently ranks among the best universities in the world. The buildings of the university include King's College Chapel, Cavendish Laboratory, and the Cambridge University Library, one of the largest legal deposit libraries in the world. The city's skyline is dominated by several college buildings, along with the spire of the Our Lady and the English Martyrs Church, and the chimney of Addenbrooke's Hospital. Anglia Ruskin University, which evolved from the Cambridge School of Art and the Cambridgeshire College of Arts and Technology, also has its main campus in the city.\nCambridge is at the heart of the high-technology Silicon Fen or Cambridge Cluster, which contains industries such as software and bioscience and many start-up companies born out of the university. Over 40 per cent of the workforce have a higher education qualification, more than twice the national average. The Cambridge Biomedical Campus, one of the largest biomedical research clusters in the world, includes the headquarters of AstraZeneca and the relocated Royal Papworth Hospital.\nCambridge produced the first 'Laws of the Game' for association football and was the site of the first game, which was held at Parker's Piece. The Strawberry Fair music and art festival and Midsummer Fair are held on Midsummer Common, and the annual Cambridge Beer Festival takes place on Jesus Green. The city is adjacent to the M11 and A14 roads.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nPrehistory.\nSettlements have existed around the Cambridge area since prehistoric times. The earliest clear evidence of occupation is the remains of a 3,500-year-old farmstead discovered at the site of Fitzwilliam College. Archaeological evidence of occupation through the Iron Age is a settlement on Castle Hill from the 1st century BC, perhaps relating to wider cultural changes occurring in southeastern Britain linked to the arrival of the Belgae.\nRoman.\nThe principal Roman site is a small fort (') Duroliponte on Castle Hill, just northwest of the city centre around the location of the earlier British village. The fort was bounded on two sides by the lines formed by the present Mount Pleasant, continuing across Huntingdon Road into Clare Street. The eastern side followed Magrath Avenue, with the southern side running near to Chesterton Lane and Kettle's Yard before turning northwest at Honey Hill. It was constructed around AD\u00a070 and converted to civilian use around 50 years later. Evidence of more widespread Roman settlement has been discovered, including numerous farmsteads and a village in the Cambridge district of Newnham.\nMedieval.\nFollowing the Roman withdrawal from Britain around 410, the location may have been abandoned by the Britons, although the site is usually identified as Cair Grauth, as listed among the 28 cities of Britain in the \"History of the Britons\" attributed to Nennius. Evidence exists that the invading Anglo-Saxons had begun occupying the area by the end of the century. Their settlement \u2013 also on and around Castle Hill \u2013 became known as Grantebrycge (\"Granta bridge\"). Anglo-Saxon grave goods have been found in the area. During this period, Cambridge benefited from good trade links across the hard-to-travel fenlands. By the 7th century, the town was less significant and described by Bede as a \"little ruined city\" containing the burial site of \u00c6thelthryth (Etheldreda). Cambridge sat on the border between the East and Middle Anglian kingdoms, and the settlement slowly expanded on both sides of the river.\nThe \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" reports that Vikings arrived in 875; they imposed Viking rule, the Danelaw, by 878. Their vigorous trading habits resulted in rapid growth of the town. During this period, the town's centre shifted from Castle Hill on the left bank of the river to the area now known as the Quayside on the right bank. After the Viking period, the Saxons enjoyed a return to power, building churches, such as St Bene't's Church, as well as wharves, merchant houses, and a mint which produced coins with the town's name abbreviated to \"Grant\".\nIn 1068, two years after the Norman Conquest of England, William the Conqueror erected a castle on Castle Hill, the motte of which survives. Like the rest of the newly conquered kingdom, Cambridge fell under the control of the King and his deputies.\nCambridge's first town charter was granted by Henry I between 1120 and 1131. It granted the town monopoly of waterborne traffic and hithe tolls and recognised the borough court. The distinctive Round Church dates from this period. In 1209, Cambridge University was founded by Oxford students fleeing from hostility. The oldest existing college, Peterhouse, was founded in 1284.\nCambridge had a significant Jewish community in the middle ages, centred on what is now known as All Saints Passage, then known as the Jewry. A synagogue stood nearby. In January 1275, Eleanor of Provence expelled Jews from all of the towns within her dower lands, and the Jews of Cambridge were ordered to relocate to Norwich.\nIn 1349, Cambridge was affected by the Black Death. Few records survive but 16 of 40 scholars at King's Hall died. The town north of the river was severely impacted, being almost wiped out. Following further depopulation after a second national epidemic in 1361, a letter from the Bishop of Ely suggested that two parishes in Cambridge be merged as there were not enough people to fill even one church. With more than a third of English clergy dying in the Black Death, four new colleges were established at the university over the following years to train new clergymen, namely Gonville Hall, Trinity Hall, Corpus Christi, and Clare.\nIn 1382, a revised town charter effected a \"diminution of the liberties that the community had enjoyed\", due to Cambridge's participation in the Peasants' Revolt. This charter transferred supervision of baking and brewing, weights and measures, and forestalling and regrating, from the town to the university.\nKing's College Chapel was begun in 1446 by King Henry VI. Built in phases by a succession of kings of England from 1446 to 1515 \u2014 its history intertwined with the Wars of the Roses \u2014 the chapel was completed during the reign of King Henry VIII. The building would become synonymous with Cambridge, and currently is used in the logo for the Cambridge City Council.\nEarly modern.\nFollowing repeated outbreaks of pestilence throughout the 16th century, sanitation and fresh water were brought to Cambridge by the construction of Hobson's Conduit in the early 1600s. Water was brought from Nine Wells, at the foot of the Gog Magog Hills to the southeast of Cambridge, into the centre of the town.\nCambridge played a significant role in the early part of the English Civil War as it was the headquarters of the Eastern Counties Association, an organisation administering a regional East Anglian army, which became the mainstay of the Parliamentarian military effort before the formation of the New Model Army. In 1643 control of the town was given by Parliament to Oliver Cromwell, who had been educated at Sidney Sussex College in Cambridge. The town's castle was fortified and garrisoned with troops and some bridges were destroyed to aid its defence. Although Royalist forces came within of the town in 1644, the defences were never used, and the garrison was stood down the following year.\nEarly-industrial era.\nIn the 19th century, in common with many other English towns, Cambridge expanded rapidly, due in part to increased life expectancy and improved agricultural production leading to increased trade in town markets. The Histon and Impington Inclosure Act 1801 (41 Geo. 3. (U.K.) c. \"112\" Pr.), the Trumpington Inclosure Act 1801 (41 Geo. 3. (U.K.) c. \"128\" Pr.), and the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Cambridge Inclosure Act 1807 (47 Geo. 3 Sess. 2. c. \"60\" Pr.) enabled the town to expand over surrounding open fields.\nThe railway came to Cambridge in 1845 after initial resistance, with the opening of the Great Eastern Railway's London to Norwich line. The station was outside the town centre following pressure from the university to restrict travel by undergraduates. With the arrival of the railway and associated employment came development of areas around the station, such as Romsey Town. The rail link to London stimulated heavier industries, such as the production of brick, cement and malt.\n20th and 21st centuries.\nFrom the 1930s to the 1980s, the size of the city was increased by several large council estates. The biggest impact has been on the area north of the river, which are now the estates of East Chesterton, King's Hedges, and Arbury where Archbishop Rowan Williams lived and worked as an assistant priest in the early 1980s.\nDuring World War II, Cambridge was an important centre for defence of the east coast. The town became a military centre, with an RAF training centre and the regional headquarters for Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire, Hertfordshire, and Bedfordshire established during the conflict. The town itself escaped relatively lightly from German bombing raids, which were mainly targeted at the railway. 29 people were killed and no historic buildings were damaged. In 1944, a secret meeting of military leaders held in Trinity College laid the foundation for the allied invasion of Europe. During the war Cambridge served as an evacuation centre for over 7,000 people from London, as well as for parts of the University of London.\nCambridge was granted its city charter in 1951 in recognition of its history, administrative importance and economic success. Cambridge does not have a cathedral, traditionally a prerequisite for city status, instead falling within the Church of England Diocese of Ely. In 1962, Cambridge's first shopping arcade, Bradwell's Court, opened on Drummer Street, though this was demolished in 2006. Other shopping arcades followed at Lion Yard, which housed a relocated Central Library for the city, and the Grafton Centre which replaced Victorian housing stock which had fallen into disrepair in the Kite area of the city. This latter project was controversial at the time.\nThe city gained its second university in 1992 when Anglia Polytechnic became Anglia Polytechnic University. Renamed Anglia Ruskin University in 2005, the institution has its origins in the Cambridge School of Art opened in 1858 by John Ruskin.\nGovernance.\nThere are two main tiers of local government covering Cambridge, at district and county level: Cambridge City Council and Cambridgeshire County Council. Since 2017, both authorities have been members of the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Combined Authority. The leader of the city council is the city's representative on the combined authority, which is led by the directly-elected Mayor of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough. The district covers most of the city's urban area, although some suburbs extend into the surrounding South Cambridgeshire district. The city council's headquarters are in the Guildhall, a large building in the market square.\nWestminster.\nThe parliamentary constituency of Cambridge covers most of the city; Daniel Zeichner (Labour) has represented the seat since the 2015 general election. The seat was generally held by the Conservatives until it was won by Labour in 1992, then taken by the Liberal Democrats in 2005 and 2010, before returning to Labour in 2015. A southern area of the city, Queen Edith's ward and Cherry Hinton ward, falls within the South Cambridgeshire constituency, whose MP is Pippa Heylings (Lib Dems), first elected in 2024.\nThe University of Cambridge formerly had two seats in the House of Commons; Sir Isaac Newton was one of the most notable MPs. The Cambridge University constituency was abolished under 1948 legislation, and ceased at the dissolution of Parliament for the 1950 general election, along with the other university constituencies.\nAdministrative history.\nCambridge was an ancient borough. Its earliest known municipal charter was issued by Henry I in the early 12th century. A subsequent charter from King John in 1207 permitted the appointment of a mayor; the first recorded mayor, Harvey FitzEustace, served in 1213. Until the 20th century, the borough covered the same area as Cambridge's fourteen ancient parishes. The borough did not include Cambridge Castle, which was in the neighbouring parish of Chesterton.\nThe borough was reformed to become a municipal borough in 1836 under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. The borough's responsibilities were primarily judicial and regulatory rather than providing public services or infrastructure. A separate body of improvement commissioners was established in 1788 to maintain the city's streets, and the commissioners were gradually given other local government functions relating to sewers and public health. The commissioners were abolished in 1889 and their functions taken on by the borough council.\nThe borough was enlarged in 1912 to take in Chesterton to the north and some areas from neighbouring parishes to the south. It was extended again in 1934 to take in Cherry Hinton, Trumpington, and parts of several other neighbouring parishes. The borough was awarded city status in 1951. In 1974, Cambridge was made a non-metropolitan district; it kept the same boundaries, which had last been expanded in 1934, but there were changes to the council's responsibilities.\nGeography and environment.\nCambridge is situated about north-by-east of London and east of Birmingham. The city is located in an area of level and relatively low-lying terrain just south of the Fens, which varies between above sea level. The town was thus historically surrounded by low-lying wetlands that have been drained as the town has expanded.\nThe underlying geology of Cambridge consists of gault clay and Chalk Marl, known locally as Cambridge Greensand, partly overlaid by terrace gravel. A layer of phosphatic nodules (coprolites) under the marl was mined in the 19th century for fertiliser; this became a major industry in the county, and its profits yielded buildings such as the Corn Exchange, Fulbourn Hospital, and St. John's Chapel until the Quarries Act 1894 and competition from America ended production.\nThe River Cam flows through the city from the village of Grantchester, to the southwest. It is bordered by water meadows within the city such as Sheep's Green as well as residential development. Like most cities, modern-day Cambridge has many suburbs and areas of high-density housing. The city centre of Cambridge is mostly commercial, historic buildings, and large green areas such as Jesus Green, Parker's Piece and Midsummer Common. Some of the roads in the centre are pedestrianised.\nPopulation growth has seen new housing developments in the 21st century, with estates such as the CB1 and Accordia schemes near the station, and developments such as Great Kneighton, formally known as Clay Farm, and Trumpington Meadows currently under construction in the south of the city. Other major developments currently being constructed in the city are Darwin Green (formerly NIAB), and University-led developments at West Cambridge and North West Cambridge, (Eddington).\nThe entire city centre, as well as parts of Chesterton, Petersfield, West Cambridge, Newnham, and Abbey, are covered by an Air Quality Management Area, implemented to counter high levels of nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere.\nClimate.\nThe city has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Cfb\"). Cambridge has an official weather observing station, at the Cambridge University Botanic Garden, about south of the city centre. In addition, the Digital Technology Group of the university's Department of Computer Science and Technology maintains a weather station on the West Cambridge site, displaying current weather conditions online via web browsers or an app, and also an archive dating back to 1995.\nThe city, like most of the UK, has a maritime climate highly influenced by the Gulf Stream. Located in the driest region of Britain, Cambridge's rainfall averages around per year, around half the national average. The driest recent year was in 2011 with of rain at the Botanic Garden and at the NIAB site. This is just below the semi-arid precipitation threshold for the area, which is 350\u00a0mm of annual precipitation. Conversely, 2012 was the wettest year on record, with reported. Snowfall accumulations are usually small, in part because of Cambridge's low elevation, and low precipitation tendency during transitional snow events.\nOwing to its low-lying, inland, and easterly position within the British Isles, summer temperatures tend to be somewhat higher than areas further west, and often rival or even exceed those recorded in the London area. Cambridge also often records the annual highest national temperature in any given year\u00a0\u2013 in July 2008 at NIAB and in August 2007 at the Botanic Garden are two recent examples. Other years include 1876, 1887, 1888, 1892, 1897, 1899 and 1900. The absolute maximum stands at recorded on 19 July 2022 at Cambridge University Botanic Garden. Before this date, Cambridge held the record for the all-time maximum temperature in the UK, after recording on 25 July 2019. Typically the temperature will reach or higher on over 25 days of the year over the 1981\u20132010 period, with the annual warmest day averaging over the same period.\nThe absolute minimum temperature recorded at the Botanic Garden site was , recorded in February 1947, although a minimum of was recorded at the now defunct observatory site in December 1879. More recently the temperature fell to on 11 February 2012, on 22 January 2013 and on 20 December 2010. The average frequency of air frosts ranges from 42.8 days at the NIAB site, to 48.3 days at the Botanic Garden per year over the 1981\u20132010 period. Typically the coldest night of the year at the Botanic Garden will fall to . Such minimum temperatures and frost averages are typical for inland areas across much of southern and central England.\nSunshine averages around 1,500 hours a year or around 35% of possible, a level typical of most locations in inland central England.\nEcology.\nThe city contains three Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs), at Cherry Hinton East Pit, Cherry Hinton West Pit, and Travellers Pit, and ten Local Nature Reserves (LNRs): Sheep's Green and Coe Fen,\nColdham's Common, Stourbridge Common, Nine Wells, Byron's Pool, West Pit, Paradise, Barnwell West, Barnwell East, and Logan's Meadow.\nGreen belt.\nCambridge is completely enclosed by green belt as a part of a wider environmental and planning policy first defined in 1965 and formalised in 1992. While some small tracts of green belt exist on the fringes of the city's boundary, much of the protection is in the surrounding South Cambridgeshire and nearby East Cambridgeshire districts, helping to maintain local green space, prevent further urban sprawl and unplanned expansion of the city, as well as protecting smaller outlying villages from further convergence with each other as well as the city.\nDemography.\nAt the 2011 census, the population of the Cambridge contiguous built-up area (urban area) was 158,434, while that of the City Council area was 123,867.\nIn the 2001 Census held during University term, 89.44% of Cambridge residents identified themselves as white, compared with a national average of 92.12%. Within the university, 84% of undergraduates and 80% of post-graduates identified as white (including overseas students).\nCambridge has a much higher than average proportion of people in the highest paid professional, managerial or administrative jobs (32.6% vs. 23.5%) and a much lower than average proportion of manual workers (27.6% vs. 40.2%). In addition, 41.2% have a higher-level qualification (e.g. degree, Higher National Diploma, Master's or PhD), much higher than the national average proportion (19.7%).\nCentre for Cities identified Cambridge as the UK's most unequal city in 2017 and 2018. Residents' income was the least evenly distributed of 57 British cities measured, with its top 6% earners accounting for 19% of its total income and the bottom 20% for only 2%, and a Gini coefficient of 0.460 in 2018.\nEconomy.\nThe town's river link to the surrounding agricultural land, and good road connections to London in the south meant Cambridge has historically served as an important regional trading post. King Henry I granted Cambridge a monopoly on river trade, privileging this area of the economy of Cambridge. The town market provided for trade in a wide variety of goods and annual trading fairs such as Stourbridge Fair and Midsummer Fair were visited by merchants from across the country. The river was described in an account of 1748 as being \"often so full of [merchant boats] that the navigation thereof is stopped for some time\". For example, 2000 firkins of butter were brought up the river every Monday from the agricultural lands to the northeast, particularly Norfolk, to be unloaded in the town for road transportation to London. Changing patterns of retail distribution and the advent of the railways led to a decline in Cambridge's importance as a market town.\nCambridge today has a diverse economy with strength in sectors such as research and development, software consultancy, high value engineering, creative industries, pharmaceuticals and tourism. Described as one of the \"most beautiful cities in the world\" by \"Forbes\" in 2010, with the view from The Backs being selected as one of the 10 greatest in England by National Trust chair Simon Jenkins. Tourism generates over \u00a3750\u00a0million for the city's economy.\nCambridge and its surrounds are sometimes referred to as Silicon Fen, an allusion to Silicon Valley, because of the density of high-tech businesses and technology incubators that have developed on science parks around the city. Many of these parks and buildings are owned or leased by university colleges, and the companies often have been spun out of the university. Cambridge Science Park, which is the largest commercial R&amp;D centre in Europe, is owned by Trinity College; St John's is the landlord of St John's Innovation Centre. Technology companies include Abcam, CSR, ARM Limited, CamSemi, Jagex and Sinclair. Microsoft has located its Microsoft Research UK offices in West Cambridge, separate from the main Microsoft UK campus in Reading, and also has an office on Station Road.\nCambridge was also the home of Pye Ltd, founded in 1898 by W. G. Pye, who worked in the Cavendish Laboratory; it began by supplying the university and later specialised in wireless telegraphy equipment, radios, televisions and also defence equipment. Pye Ltd evolved into several other companies including TETRA radio equipment manufacturer Sepura. Another major business is Marshall Aerospace located on the eastern edge of the city. The Cambridge Network keeps businesses in touch with each other.\nTransport.\nAir.\nCambridge City Airport has no scheduled services and is used mainly by charter and training flights and by Marshall Aerospace for aircraft maintenance. London Stansted Airport, about south via the M11 or direct rail, offers a broad range of international destinations.\nCycling.\nThe city lies on fairly flat land and has the highest level of cycle use in the UK. According to the 2001 census, 25% of residents travelled to work by bicycle. Furthermore, a survey in 2013 found that 47% of residents travel by bike at least once a week.\nRailway.\nCambridge railway station was opened in 1845. Trains run to King's Lynn and Ely (via the Fen Line), Norwich (via the Breckland Line), Leicester, Birmingham New Street, Peterborough, Stevenage, Ipswich, Stansted Airport, Brighton and Gatwick Airport.\nThe station has direct rail links to London with termini at London King's Cross (via the Cambridge Line and the East Coast Main Line), Liverpool Street (on the West Anglia Main Line) and St Pancras (on the Thameslink line). Fast trains to London King's Cross run every half-hour during peak hours, with a journey time of 53 minutes, and these are supplemented by semi-fast trains to Brighton via London St Pancras, and slow trains to London King's Cross. The station's original line to London was to Bishopsgate, via Bishops Stortford.\nA second railway station, Cambridge North, opened on 21 May 2017; it was originally planned to open in March 2015. A third railway station, Cambridge South, near Addenbrooke's Hospital is now under construction; it is expected to open in 2025. The former station of Cherryhinton, for Cherry Hinton, operated when it was separate village to Cambridge.\nSeveral railway lines were closed during the 1960s, including the Cambridge and St Ives branch line, the Stour Valley Railway, the Cambridge to Mildenhall railway and the Varsity Line to Oxford.\nRoad.\nAreas outside the centre are car dependent causing traffic congestion in the drivable parts of centre. The M11 motorway from east London terminates to the north-west of the city where it joins the A14, a road from the port of Felixstowe to Rugby. The A428 connects the city with the A1 at St Neots as the A421 (via Bedford and Milton Keynes) on to Oxford. The A10 connects via Ely to King's Lynn to the north and the historic route south to the City of London.\nBuses.\nCambridge has five Park and Ride sites, all of which operate seven days a week and are aimed at encouraging motorists to park near the city's edge. Since 2011, the Cambridgeshire Guided Busway has carried bus services into the centre of Cambridge from St Ives, Huntingdon and other towns and villages along the routes, operated by Stagecoach in the Fens and Whippet. The A service continues on to the railway station and Addenbrookes, before terminating at a new Park and Ride in Trumpington. Since 2017, it has also linked to Cambridge North railway station.\nService 905 provides a connection with Oxford, although passengers wishing to continue beyond Bedford have to change to service X5; both services are operated by Stagecoach East and run daily.\nFuture plans.\nIn February 2020, consultations opened for a transport system known as the Cambridgeshire Autonomous Metro. It would have connected the historic city centre and the existing busway route with the mainline railway stations, Cambridge Science Park and Haverhill. In May 2021 the newly elected mayor said he was focused instead on a \"revamped bus network\" but would not yet abandon the work done. As of November 2022[ [update]], the Greater Cambridge Partnership is consulting on plans comprising: transforming the bus network; investing in other sustainable travel schemes; and introducing a Cambridge Congestion Charge as part of a Sustainable Travel Zone.\nIn 2024, Cambridge Connect proposed repurposing the planned route of the canceled metro as a light railway. Known as the Isaac Newton line, it would connect the mainline railway stations with Cambourne, the guided busway station at Trumpington, Haverhill, Addenbrookes Hospital, and a new station in Cambridge city centre.\nEducation.\nCambridge's two universities, the collegiate University of Cambridge and the local campus of Anglia Ruskin University, serve around 30,000 students, by some estimates. Cambridge University stated its 2020/21 student population was 24,270, and Anglia Ruskin reports 24,000 students across its two campuses (one of which is outside Cambridge, in Chelmsford) for the same period. ARU now (2019) has additional campuses in London and Peterborough. State provision in the further education sector includes Hills Road Sixth Form College, Long Road Sixth Form College, and Cambridge Regional College. The Open University had a presence in the city between 1979 and 2018.\nBoth state and private schools serve Cambridge pupils from nursery to secondary school age. State schools are administered by Cambridgeshire County Council, which maintains 251 schools in total, 35 of them in Cambridge city. Netherhall School, Chesterton Community College, the Parkside Federation (comprising Parkside Community College and Coleridge Community College), North Cambridge Academy and the Christian inter-denominational St Bede's School provide comprehensive secondary education. Many other pupils from the Cambridge area attend village colleges, an educational institution unique to Cambridgeshire, which serve as secondary schools during the day and adult education centres outside of school hours. Independent schools in the city include The Perse School, Stephen Perse Foundation, Sancton Wood School, St Mary's School, Heritage School and The Leys School. The city has one university technical college, Cambridge Academy for Science and Technology, which opened in September 2014.\nSport.\nFootball.\nCambridge played a unique role in the invention of modern football: the game's first set of rules was drawn up by members of the university in 1848. The Cambridge Rules were first played on Parker's Piece and had a \"defining influence on the 1863 Football Association rules\", which again were first played on Parker's Piece.\nThe city is home to Cambridge United, who play at the Abbey Stadium. Formed in 1912 as Abbey United, they were elected to the Football League in 1970 and reached the Second Division in 1978, although a serious decline in them in the mid-1980s saw them drop back down to the Fourth Division and almost go out of business. Success returned to the club in the early 1990s when they won two successive promotions and reached the FA Cup quarter finals in both of those seasons and, in 1992, they came close to becoming the first English team to win three successive Football League promotions which would have taken them into the newly created FA Premier League; however, they were beaten in the play-offs and another decline set in. In 2005, they were relegated from the Football League and, for the second time in twenty years, narrowly avoided going out of business. After nine years of non-league football, they returned to the Football League in 2014 by winning the Conference National play-offs.\nCambridge United WFC is a women's only football club based in Cambridge. The team compete in the FA Women's National League South East. The club plays home games at St Neots Town's Rowley Park stadium and the Abbey Stadium.\nCambridge City, of the Northern Premier League Division One Midlands, now play in neighbouring St Ives. Formed in 1908 as Cambridge Town, the club were Southern Premier League champions in 1962\u201363, the highest they have finished in the English football pyramid. After a legal dispute with their landlords, the club left their City Ground stadium in 2013 to groundshare at Histon's Bridge Road ground. The club have plans to open their own new ground in Sawston in 2024.\nCricket.\nParker's Piece was used for first-class cricket matches from 1817 to 1864. The University of Cambridge's cricket ground, Fenner's, is located in the city and is one of the home grounds for minor counties team Cambridgeshire CCC. The Cambridgeshire Cricket Association operates an amateur club cricket league with six adult divisions, including numerous clubs in the city, plus junior divisions. Most of the university colleges also operate their own teams, and there are several casual village cricket teams that play in the city suburbs.\nRugby.\nThe city is represented in both codes of Rugby football. Rugby union club Cambridge R.U.F.C. were founded in 1923 and play in the RFU Championship at their home ground, Grantchester Road, in the south-west corner of the city. Cambridge Lions represent the city in rugby league and are members of East Rugby League. \nWatersports.\nThe River Cam, which runs through the city centre, is used for boating. The university and its colleges are well known for rowing and the Cambridgeshire Rowing Association, formed in 1868, organises competitive rowing on the river outside of the university. Rowing clubs based in the city include City of Cambridge RC, Cambridge '99 RC, Cantabrigian RC and Rob Roy BC. Parts of the Cam are used for recreational punting, a type of boating in which the craft is propelled by pushing against the river bed with a quant pole.\nCambridge Swimming Club, Cambridge Dive team and City of Cambridge Water Polo Club are all based at Parkside Swimming Pool.\nParkour/freerunning.\nHome and training ground to many influential traceurs, Cambridge is well known for its vibrant, and at times high-profile, parkour and freerunning scene.\nOther sports.\nCambridge is home to two real tennis courts (out of about 50 in the world) at Cambridge University Real Tennis Club.

The theatre often has touring shows, as well as those by local companies. The largest venue in the city to regular hold theatrical performances is the Cambridge Corn Exchange with a capacity of 1,800 standing or 1,200 seated. Housed within the city's 19th century former corn exchange building the venue was used for a variety of additional functions throughout the 20th century including tea parties, motor shows, sports matches and a music venue with temporary stage. The City Council renovated the building in the 1980s, turning it into a full-time arts venue, hosting theatre, dance and music performances.\nThe newest theatre venue in Cambridge is the 220-seat J2, part of Cambridge Junction in Cambridge Leisure Park. The venue was opened in 2005 and hosts theatre, dance, live music and comedy. The ADC Theatre is managed by the University of Cambridge, and typically has 3 shows a week during term time. It hosts the Cambridge University Footlights Dramatic Club which has produced many notable figures in British comedy. The Mumford Theatre is part of Anglia Ruskin University, and hosts shows by both student and non-student groups. There are also a number of venues within the colleges.\nMuseums.\nWithin the city there are several notable museums, some run by the University of Cambridge Museums consortium and others independent of it.\nThe Fitzwilliam Museum is the city's largest, and is the lead museum of the University of Cambridge Museums. Founded in 1816 from the bequeathment and collections of Richard, Viscount FitzWilliam, the museum was originally located in the building of the Perse Grammar School in Free School Lane. After a brief housing in the University of Cambridge library, it moved to its current, purpose-built building on Trumpington Street in 1848. The museum has five departments: Antiquities; Applied Arts; Coins and Medals; Manuscripts and Printed Books; and Paintings, Drawings and Prints.

For the supply of electricity, Cambridge is part of the East of England region, for which the distribution network operator is UK Power Networks. The city has no power stations, though a five-metre wind turbine, part of a Cambridge Regional College development, can be seen in King's Hedges. The Cambridge Electric Supply Company had provided the city with electricity since the early twentieth century from Cambridge power station. Upon nationalisation of the electricity industry in 1948 ownership passed to the British Electricity Authority and later to the Central Electricity Generating Board. Electricity connections to the national grid rendered the small 7.26 megawatt (MW) coal fired power station redundant. It closed in 1965 and was subsequently demolished; in its final year of operation it delivered 2771 MWh of electricity to the city.\nLibrary.\nFollowing the Public Libraries Act 1850 the city's first public library, located on Jesus Lane, was opened in 1855.

Like Cambridge, both have universities and are also similar in population; Heidelberg, Germany since 1965, and Szeged, Hungary since 1987.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "36997", "revid": "48227547", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36997", "title": "Christian Democracy (Italy)", "text": "Italian political party (1943\u20131994)\nChristian Democracy ( ], DC) was a Christian democratic political party in Italy. The DC was founded on 15 December 1943 in the Italian Social Republic (Nazi-occupied Italy) as the nominal successor of the Italian People's Party, which had the same symbol, a crusader shield (\"scudo crociato\"). As a Catholic-inspired, centrist, catch-all party comprising both centre-right and centre-left political factions, the DC played a dominant role in the politics of Italy for fifty years, and had been part of the government from soon after its inception until its final demise on 16 January 1994 amid the \"Tangentopoli\" scandals. Christian Democrats led the Italian government continuously from 1946 until 1981. The party was nicknamed the \"White Whale\" () due to its huge organisation and official colour. During its time in government, the Italian Communist Party was the largest opposition party.\nFrom 1946 until 1994, the DC was the largest party in the Italian Parliament, governing in successive coalitions, including the \"Pentapartito\" system. It originally supported liberal-conservative governments, along with the moderate Italian Democratic Socialist Party, the Italian Liberal Party, and the Italian Republican Party, before moving towards the Organic Centre-left involving the Italian Socialist Party. The party was succeeded by a string of smaller parties, including the Italian People's Party, the Christian Democratic Centre, the United Christian Democrats, and the still active Union of the Centre. Former DC members are also spread among other parties, including the centre-right Forza Italia and the centre-left Democratic Party. It was a founding member of the European People's Party in 1976.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nThe party was founded as the revival of the Italian People's Party (PPI), a political party created in 1919 by Luigi Sturzo, a Catholic priest. The PPI won over 20% of the votes in the 1919 and 1921 general elections, but was declared illegal by the Fascist dictatorship in 1926 despite the presence of some \"Popolari\" in Benito Mussolini's first government.\nAs World War II was ending, the Christian Democrats started organising post-Fascist Italy in coalition with all the other mainstream parties, including the Italian Communist Party (PCI), the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), the Italian Liberal Party (PLI), the Italian Republican Party (PRI), the Action Party (Pd'A) and the Labour Democratic Party (PDL). In December 1945 Christian Democrat Alcide De Gasperi was appointed Prime Minister of Italy.\nThe Christian Democracy party was opposed to both Fascism and Communism. In elections Italians were voting based on a way of life, not just a political party. Christian ideals were usually paired with the idea of freedom.\nIn the 1946 general election the DC won 35.2% of the vote.\nDe Gasperi and centrism.\nIn May 1947 De Gasperi broke decisively with his Communist and Socialist coalition partners under pressure from U.S. President Harry Truman. This opened the way for a centrist coalition that included the Italian Workers' Socialist Party (PSLI), a centrist break-away from the PSI, as well as its usual allies, the PLI and the PRI.\nIn the 1948 general election the DC went on to win a decisive victory, with the support of the Catholic Church and the United States, and obtained 48.5% of the vote, its best result ever. Despite his party's absolute majority in the Italian Parliament, De Gasperi continued to govern at the head of the centrist coalition, which was successively abandoned by the Liberals, who hoped for more right-wing policies, in 1950 and the Democratic Socialists, who hoped for more leftist policies, in 1951.\nUnder De Gasperi, major land reforms were carried out in the poorer rural regions in the early postwar years, with farms appropriated from the large landowners and parcelled out to the peasants. In addition, during its years in office, Christian Democrats passed a number of laws safeguarding employees from exploitation, established a national health service, and initiated low-cost housing in Italy's major cities.\nDe Gasperi served as prime minister until 1953 and died a year later. No Christian Democrat would match his longevity in office and, despite the fact that DC's share of the vote was always between 38 and 43% from 1953 to 1979, the party was more and more fractured. As a result, Prime Ministers changed more frequently.\nCentre-left governments.\nFrom 1954 the DC was led by progressive Christian Democrats, such as Amintore Fanfani, Aldo Moro and Benigno Zaccagnini, supported by the influential left-wing factions. In the 1950s the party formed centrist or moderately centre-left coalitions, and even a short-lived government led by Fernando Tambroni relying on parliamentary support from the Italian Social Movement (MSI), the post-fascist party.\nIn 1963 the party, under Prime Minister Aldo Moro, formed a coalition with the PSI, which returned to ministerial roles after 16 years, the PSDI and the PRI. Similar \"Organic Centre-left\" governments became usual through the 1960s and the 1970s.\nHistoric Compromise.\nFrom 1976 to 1979 the DC governed with the external support of the PCI, through the Historic Compromise. Moro, who was the party main leader and who had inspired the Compromise, was abducted and murdered by the Red Brigades.\nThe event was a shock for the party. When Moro was abducted, the government, at the time led by Giulio Andreotti, immediately took a hardline position stating that the \"State must not bend\" on terrorist demands. This was a very different position from the one taken in similar cases before and after (such as the kidnapping of Ciro Cirillo, a Campanian DC member for whom a ransom was paid thanks to the local ties of the party with the Camorra). It was however supported by all the mainstream parties, including the PCI, with the two notable exceptions of the PSI and the Radicals. In the trial for Mafia allegations against Andreotti, it was said that he took the chance of getting rid of a dangerous political competitor by sabotaging all of the rescue options and ultimately leaving the captors with no option but killing him. During his captivity Moro wrote a series of letters, at times very critical of Andreotti.. Later the memorial written by Moro during his imprisonment was subject to several plots, including the assassination of journalist Mino Pecorelli and general Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa.\n\"Pentapartito\".\nAt the beginning of the 1980s, the DC had lost part of its support among Italian voters. In 1981, Giovanni Spadolini of the PRI was the first non-Christian Democrat to lead a government since 1944, at the head of a coalition comprising the DC, the PSI, the PSDI, the PRI and the PLI, the so-called \"Pentapartito\". In the successive 1983 general election, the DC suffered one of its largest declines in votes up to that point, receiving only 32.5% of the vote cast (a decline of -5.8% relative to 1981). Subsequently, Bettino Craxi (leader of the rising PSI) reclaimed for himself the post of prime minister, again at the head of a \"Pentapartito\" government.\nDC re-gained the post of prime minister in 1987, after a modest recovery in the 1987 general election (34.2%), and the \"Pentapartito\" coalition governed Italy almost continuously until 1993. While Italy experienced steady economic progress in the 1980s, the Italian economy was being undermined by a constant devaluation of the Italian lira and the issuing of large amounts of high-interest treasury bonds, so that, between 1982 and 1992, the excessive budget deficit built a significant proportion of the debt that would plague the country well into the 21st century.\nDissolution and aftermath.\nIn 1992 the \"Mani pulite\" investigation was started in Milan, uncovering the so-called \"Tangentopoli\" scandals (endemic corruption practices at the highest levels), and causing numerous, often controversial, arrests and resignations. After the dismal result in the 1992 general election (29.7%), also due to the rise of in northern Italy and two years of mounting scandals (which included several Mafia investigations which notably touched Andreotti), the party was disbanded in 1994. In the 1990s most of the politicians prosecuted during those investigations were acquitted, sometimes however on the basis of legal formalities or on the basis of the Statute of limitations.\nIn 1992, Mario Segni led a breakaway faction called Populars for Reform (PR). The DC suffered heavy defeats in the 1993 provincial and municipal elections. Subsequently, Segni's PR would be reformed as the Segni Pact, and contemporary polling suggested heavy losses for the DC in the upcoming 1994 general election. In hopes of changing the party's image, the DC's last secretary, Mino Martinazzoli decided to change the name of the party into the Italian People's Party (PPI). \nPier Ferdinando Casini, representing the right-wing faction of the party (previously led by Forlani) decided to launch a new party called Christian Democratic Centre and form an alliance with Silvio Berlusconi's new party, Forza Italia (FI). The left-wing factions stayed within the new PPI, though a minority would form the Social Christians in 1993 and would join forces with the post-communist Democratic Party of the Left (DPS). Some right-wingers, feeling Casini was still too moderate, joined the National Alliance. \nIn 1995, the centre-right United Christian Democrats, which were led by Rocco Buttiglione, split off from the PPI and also entered in alliance with FI. In the following years, most Christian Democrats joined FI, which became the party with the most ex-DC members in absolute terms. In December 1999, Forza Italia gained full membership in the European People's Party.\nThe PPI would continue in a rump fashion, usually finding itself in left of centre political coalitions. In 1996, under Franco Marini, the PPI would ally with the DPS and several smaller centre-left parties to form The Olive Tree. The alliance, whose primary components were two legal successors to the two major political forces of pre-1990s Italy, won the election. Romano Prodi, an independent former PPI member, led the list and became prime minister.\nFaced with flagging poll numbers, the PPI formed Democracy is Freedom \u2013 The Daisy (DL) after allying three other smaller, social liberal parties to contest the 2001 election. DL would be formed as an official political party in 2002, succeeding the PPI and its three allies. In 2007, DL would merge with the Democrats of the Left, the successor of the DPS, to form the Democratic Party, which is today the largest centre-left political party in Italy.\nIdeology.\nThe party's ideology drew on the Christian democratic doctrines developed from the 19th century referred to as Catholic social teaching, the political thought of Romolo Murri and Luigi Sturzo, and ultimately the tradition of the defunct Italian People's Party. Two Papal encyclicals, \"Rerum novarum\" (1891) of Pope Leo XIII, and \"Quadragesimo anno\" (1931) of Pope Pius XI, offered a further basis for the DC's social and political doctrine.\nIn economics, the DC preferred competition to cooperation, supported the model of social market economy, and rejected the Marxist idea of class struggle. The party thus advocated collaboration between social classes and was basically a catch-all party which aimed to represent both right-wing and left-wing Italian Catholics under the principle of the \"political unity of Catholics\" against socialism, communism and anarchism. It ultimately represented the majority of Italians who were opposed to the Italian Communist Party. The party was, however, originally equidistant between the Communists and the hard right represented by the Italian Social Movement.\nAs a catch-all party, the DC differed from other European Christian Democratic parties, such as the Christian Democratic Union of Germany, that were mainly conservative political groupings. The DC, which included conservative as well as social-democratic and liberal elements was characterised by factionalism and by the double adherence of members to the party and to factions which were often identified with individual leaders.\nFactions.\nThe DC's factions spanned the political spectrum from left to right and continually evolved over time.\nIn the early years, centrists and liberal-conservatives such as Alcide De Gasperi, Giuseppe Pella, Ezio Vanoni and Mario Scelba led the party. After them, progressives led by Amintore Fanfani were in charge, though opposed by right wing led by Antonio Segni. The party's left wing, with its roots in the left of the late Italian People's Party (Giovanni Gronchi, Achille Grandi and controversial Fernando Tambroni), was reinforced by new leaders such as Giuseppe Dossetti, Giorgio La Pira, Giuseppe Lazzati and Fanfani himself. Most of them were social democrats by European standards.\nThe party was often led by centrist figures unaffiliated to any faction such as Aldo Moro, Mariano Rumor (both closer to the centre-left) and Giulio Andreotti (closer to the centre-right). Moreover, it was often the case that if the government was led by a centre-right Christian Democrat, the party was led by a left-winger and vice versa. This was what happened in the 1950s when Fanfani was party secretary and the government was led by centre-right figures such as Scelba and Segni, as well as in the late 1970s when Benigno Zaccagnini, a progressive, led the party and Andreotti the government. This custom, in clear contrast with the principles of a Westminster system, deeply weakened DC-led governments, so that even with broad majorities they were unable to resolve differences between the several factions of the party, and ultimately turning the Italian political system into a de facto particracy (\"partitocrazia\").\nFrom the 1980s the party was divided between the centre-right led by Arnaldo Forlani (supported also by the party's right wing) and the centre-left led by Ciriaco De Mita (whose supporters included trade unionists and the internal left), with Andreotti holding the balance. De Mita, who led the party from 1982 to 1989, tried to transform the party into a mainstream \"conservative party\" in line with the European People's Party to preserve party unity. He became prime minister in 1988 but was replaced by Forlani in 1989. Disagreements between de Mita and Forlani brought Andreotti back to the prime-ministership from 1989 to 1992.\nWith the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the great Cold War ideological conflict, and ultimately the \"Tangentopoli\" scandals, the heterogeneous nature of the party led it to its collapse. The bulk of the DC's membership joined the new Italian People's Party (PPI), but immediately several centre-right elements led by Pier Ferdinando Casini joined the Christian Democratic Centre (CCD), while others directly joined Forza Italia. A split from the PPI, the United Christian Democrats (CDU), joined Forza Italia and the CCD in the centre-right Pole of Freedoms coalition (later becoming the Pole for Freedoms), while the PPI was a founding member of The Olive Tree centre-left coalition in 1996.\nPopular support.\nIn its early years, the party was stronger in Northern Italy (especially in eastern Lombardy and Veneto), due to the strong Catholic roots of those areas, than it was in the South. There, the Liberal establishment that had governed Italy for decades before the rise of Benito Mussolini still had grip on voters, as well as the Monarchist National Party and the Common Man's Front. The DC was very weak in Emilia-Romagna and Central Italy, where the Italian Communist Party was the dominant political force.\nIn the 1948 general election the party had its best result ever (48.5%) and an absolute majority in the Italian Parliament. The party won 66.8% in eastern Lombardy (73.6% in the Province of Bergamo), 60.5% in Veneto (71.9% in the Province of Vicenza), 69.6% in Trentino and 57.8% in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, that is to say where the late Italian People's Party had its strongholds. In the Centre-South the DC gained more than 50% of the vote in Lazio (51.9%), Abruzzo (53.7%) and Campania (50.5%).\nFrom the late 1950s, the DC's support started to move South and by the 1980s it was stronger in the South than in the North, with the exception of Veneto, which remained one of the party's strongholds. In the 1983 general election the party suffered a dramatic decrease in term of votes and its electoral geography was very different from 30 or even 10 years before, as the region where it obtained the best result was Apulia (46.0%).\nIn the 1992 general election the shift was even more evident as the party was over the 40% mark only in some Southern regions (41.1% in Campania, 44.5 in Basilicata and 41.2% in Sicily), while it barely reached 20-25% of the vote in the North. As a result of the rise of , which was stronger precisely in the traditional Christian Democratic heartlands, the DC was reduced to 21.0% in Piedmont (with the League at 16.3%), 32.1% in western Lombardy (League at 25.2%), 31.7% in Veneto (League at 17.3%) and 28.0% in Friuli-Venezia Giulia (League at 17.0%).\nAs the DC's role was reduced, the 1919 PPI strongholds and the DC's traditional heartlands would become the Lega Nord's power base. Meanwhile, the successor parties of the DC continued to be key political actors only in the South, where the clientelistic way of government practised by the Christian Democrats and their allies had left a mark. In the 1996 general election the League gained 7 out of 8 single-seat constituencies in the Province of Bergamo and 5 out of 6 in the Province of Vicenza, winning well over 40%, while the combined score of the three main post-DC parties (the new PPI, the CCD and the CDU) was highest in Campania (22.3%). In the 1996 Sicilian regional election the combined score of those parties was 26.4%.\nThe electoral results of the DC in general (Chamber of Deputies) and European Parliament elections since 1946 are shown in the chart below.\n&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chart/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;\nControversies.\nHaving ruled Italy for over 40 years with no alternative other than the Italian Communist Party, DC members had ample opportunity to abuse their power, and some did. In the 1960s, scandals involved frauds such as huge illegal profits in the administration of banana import quotas and preferential allocation of purposely misprinted and therefore rare postage stamps. Giovanni Leone was forced to resign as President of the Italian Republic in 1978 after the Lockheed bribery scandals. He was later acquitted.\nLike the other parties of the \"Pentapartito\" coalition, the DC was invested in the \"Tangentopoli\" scandals and in the subsequent \"Mani pulite\". Moreover, as Southern Italy had become the party's stronghold in the 1970s and the 1980s, it was likely that the Sicilian Mafia and dishonest politicians tried to collaborate. The DC was the party most associated with Mafia among the public. Leaders such as Antonio Gava, Calogero Mannino, Vito Ciancimino, Salvo Lima and especially Giulio Andreotti were perceived by many to belong to a grey zone between simple corruption and Mafia business, even if most of them were later acquitted.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "36999", "revid": "51010767", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36999", "title": "Carry On (franchise)", "text": "Sequence of 31 British comedy films\nCarry On is a British comedy franchise comprising 31 films, the success of which led to several spin-offs, including four Christmas television specials (1969\u20131973), a 1975 television series of 13 episodes, a West End stage show and two provincial summer shows, produced between 1958 and 1992. Produced by Peter Rogers, the \"Carry On\" films were directed by Gerald Thomas and starred a regular ensemble that included Sid James, Kenneth Williams, Charles Hawtrey, Joan Sims, Kenneth Connor, Peter Butterworth, Hattie Jacques, Terry Scott, Bernard Bresslaw, Barbara Windsor, Jack Douglas, and Jim Dale. The humour of \"Carry On\" was in the British comic tradition of music hall and bawdy seaside postcards.\nThe \"Carry On\" series contains the largest number of films of any British film franchise, and is the second longest running, albeit with a 14-year gap (1978\u20131992) between the 30th and 31st entries. (The \"James Bond\" film series is the longest-running, having started in 1962, four years after the first \"Carry On\", though with fewer films.)\nRogers and Thomas were responsible for all 31 films, usually on time and to a strict budget, and often employed the same crew\u2014some of whom were also regulars on the James Bond series, such as Peter Lamont, Alan Hume, and Anthony Waye. Between 1958 and 1992, the series employed seven writers, most often Norman Hudis (1958\u20131962) and Talbot Rothwell (1963\u20131974). Anglo Amalgamated Film Distributors Ltd produced 12 films (1958\u20131966), and the Rank Organisation made 18 (1966\u20131978), while United International Pictures produced one (1992).\nAll films were made at Pinewood Studios near Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire. Budgetary constraints meant that a large proportion of the location filming was undertaken close to the studios in and around south Buckinghamshire, including areas of Berkshire and Middlesex. However, by the late 1960s, at the height of the series' success, more ambitious plots occasionally necessitated locations further afield, which included Snowdonia National Park, Wales (with the foot of Snowdon standing in for the Khyber Pass in \"Carry On Up the Khyber\"), and the beaches of the Sussex coast doubling as Saharan sand dunes in \"Follow That Camel\".\nBackground.\n\"Carry On Sergeant\" (1958) is about a group of recruits doing National Service; its title, a command commonly issued by army officers to their sergeants in the course of their routine duties, was in keeping with its setting. The film was sufficiently successful to inspire a similar venture, again focusing on an established and respected profession in \"Carry On Nurse\". When that too was successful, further forays with \"Carry On Teacher\" and \"Carry On Constable\" established the series. This initial 'pattern' was broken with the fifth film in 1961, \"Carry On Regardless\", but it still followed a similar plot to that of many of the early films\u2014a small group of misfit newcomers to a job make comic mistakes, but come together to succeed in the end.\nThe remainder of the series developed with increased use of the British comic traditions of music hall and bawdy seaside postcards. Many titles parodied more serious films, such as their tongue-in-cheek homages to James Bond (\"Spying\"), westerns (\"Cowboy\"), and Hammer horror films (\"Screaming!\"). The most impressive of these was \"Carry On Cleo\" (1964), in which the budget-conscious production team made full use of some impressive sets that had been created in 1960 for the Burton and Taylor epic \"Cleopatra\" (1963) but abandoned when production moved to Rome. \"Carry On Emmannuelle\", inspired by the soft-porn \"Emmanuelle\", brought to an end the original \"Carry On\" run.\nThe stock-in-trade of \"Carry On\" humour was innuendo and the sending-up of British institutions that the target audience would have experienced or be aware of, such as the National Health Service (\"Nurse\", \"Doctor\", \"Again Doctor\", \"Matron\"), the British state (\"Henry\", \"Up the Khyber\"), the forces (\"Sergeant\", \"England\", \"Jack\", \"Constable\") amongst others. Although the films were very often panned by critics, they mostly proved very popular with audiences. In 2007, the pun \"Infamy, infamy, they've all got it in for me\", spoken by Kenneth Williams (playing Julius Caesar) in \"Carry on Cleo\", was voted the funniest one-line joke in film history. However, this line had originally been written by Frank Muir and Denis Norden for Jimmy Edwards in the radio series\" Take It From Here\" some years previously.\nA film had appeared in 1957 under the title \"Carry On Admiral\"; although this was a comedy in similar vein (and even featured Joan Sims in the cast) it has no connection to the \"Carry On\" series itself. The much earlier 1937 film \"Carry On London\" is also unrelated (though it coincidentally starred future \"Carry On\" performer Eric Barker).\nThe cast were poorly paid\u2014around \u00a35,000 per film for a principal male performer, female leads earnt less, between \u00a32,000 to \u00a33,000. In his diaries Kenneth Williams lamented this, and criticised several of the movies despite his declared fondness for the series as a whole. Peter Rogers, the series' producer, acknowledged: \"Kenneth was worth taking care of, because while he cost very little [...] he made a very great deal of money for the franchise.\" Phil Silvers was cast in Follow That Camel, partly to raise the franchise profile in the USA, and was paid \u00a330,000, far in excess of any of the regular actors.\nCast.\nThe \"Carry On\" series includes a broad cast across the films and other adaptations. The regular core ensemble cast was made up of Sid James, Kenneth Williams, Charles Hawtrey, Joan Sims, Kenneth Connor, Peter Butterworth, Hattie Jacques, Bernard Bresslaw, Barbara Windsor, Jim Dale, Patsy Rowlands, Jack Douglas and Terry Scott.\nFilmography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPlanned films.\nSeveral other films were planned, scripted (or partly scripted) or entered pre-production before being abandoned:\n\"Carry On Again Nurse\".\nAn intended sub-sequel to the successful \"Carry On Nurse\" was renamed and made as \"Carry On Doctor\" in 1967. \"Carry On Nurse\" was alluded to twice in \"Carry On Doctor\", firstly with the sub-titles (one reading \"Nurse Carries On Again\" and \"Death of a Daffodil\"), and again in a later scene with Frankie Howerd commenting on a vase of daffodils in his hospital room. A second attempt at \"Carry On Again Nurse\" came in 1979, after the series left Rank Films and moved to Hemdale. A completed script had been written by George Layton and Jonathan Lynn in 1977, but the attempt was cancelled due to the financial loss of \"Carry On Emmannuelle\".\nThe final attempt to create \"Carry On Again Nurse\" came in 1988, with a script written by Norman Hudis. It was to revolve around a hospital set for closure, and set to star original actors Barbara Windsor, Jack Douglas, Kenneth Williams, Charles Hawtrey, Kenneth Connor and Joan Sims, with Sims filling in the role of Matron that was previously held by Hattie Jacques. The end of the film was going to be a tribute to Jacques, with Sims turning around a photograph of the actress and asking \"Well, did I do alright?\" (the script is included in the book \"The Lost Carry Ons\"). Production was scheduled to begin in June 1988, but the death of Williams two months previously, followed by that of Hawtrey six months later \u2013 combined with a budget of \u00a31.5 million, which was deemed too expensive \u2013 proved to be the end of the film and it was cancelled.\n\"Carry On London\".\nThe final proposed \"Carry On\", before Peter Rogers's death in 2009, was \"Carry On London\". Announced in 2003 by Rogers and producer James Black, it remained in pre-production well into 2008. The script was signed off by the production company in late March 2008, and \"centred on a limousine company ferrying celebrities to an awards show\". The film had several false starts, with the producers and cast changing extensively over time. Only the little-known Welsh actress Jynine James remained a consistent name from 2003 to 2008. Danniella Westbrook, David Jason, Shaun Williamson and Burt Reynolds were also once attached to the project. It was announced in May 2006 that Vinnie Jones and Shane Richie were to star in the film, which was to be directed by Peter Richardson, though Ed Bye later replaced him as the named director. At the 50th anniversary party held at Pinewood Studios in March 2008, Rogers confirmed that he was planning a series of \"Carry On\" films after \"London\", subject to the success of the first.\nIn early 2009, \"Carry On London\" or \"Carry On Bananas\" was once again 'back on', with Charlie Higson attached as director, and a different, more modern, cast list involving Paul O'Grady (as the acidic Kenneth Williamsesque character), Jynine James, Lenny Henry, Justin Lee Collins, Jennifer Ellison (as the saucy Barbara Windsor type), Liza Tarbuck (paralleling Hattie Jacques), Meera Syal, James Dreyfus, and Frank Skinner (filling in the Sid James role). Despite new media interest and sets being constructed at Pinewood Studios, the film was once again put on hold, and the project was abandoned after the death of Peter Rogers in April 2009.\nReboot.\nIn May 2016, producer Jonathan Sothcott of Hereford Films announced plans for a new series of \"Carry On\" films, beginning with \"Carry On Doctors\" and \"Carry On Campus\". On 12 April 2017, Sothcott confirmed to the website \"The Hollywood News\" that he was no longer involved with the film series. As of September 2019, three \"Carry On\" films were set to be filmed back-to-back, after Brian Baker won the rights to the movies following a legal battle with ITV earlier that year. Production of the new films had been planned to take place in spring 2020. However, filming was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and little more was heard about the project until after the death of Barbara Windsor in December 2020, when Baker announced that he would be using old footage of the actress in the film, saying \"Barbara will be making an appearance.\" Baker told the \"Daily Star Sunday\" that \"we have got two new stories and we are looking to do one of the old ones again to bring it up to modern day quality \u2013 probably \"Carry On Sergeant\"\".\nBaker's company Carry On Films Ltd was later dissolved.\nSpin-offs.\nTelevision.\nThe characters and comedy style of the \"Carry On\" film series were adapted to a television series titled \"Carry On Laughing\", and several Christmas specials.\nAlbum.\nIn 1971, Music for Pleasure released a long-playing record, \"Oh! What a Carry On!\" (MFP MONO 1416), featuring songs performed by Kenneth Williams, Jim Dale, Kenneth Connor, Frankie Howerd, Bernard Bresslaw, Joan Sims, Barbara Windsor, and Dora Bryan.\nLegacy.\nDocumentaries.\nA 50-minute television documentary, \"What's a Carry On?\", was made in 1998 for the 40th anniversary of the first film. It included archive clips, out-takes and interviews with surviving cast members. It was included as an extra on the DVD release of \"Carry On Emmannuelle\".\nA two-hour radio documentary, \"Carry On Forever!\", presented by Leslie Phillips, was broadcast in two parts on BBC Radio 2 on 19 and 20 July 2010. A three-part television retrospective with the same title, narrated by Martin Clunes, was shown on ITV3 in the UK over Easter 2015.\nHome media.\nThe \"Carry On\" film series has had numerous individual releases on VHS, and a number of VHSs were released in an eighteen VHS box-set on 1 September 2003.\nThe film series was first released as a DVD box-set on 1 September 2008, by ITV Studios Home Entertainment. Five years later, on 7 October 2013, it was re-released with smaller packaging. All the movies contained in the collection are also available to buy individually.\nSince 2013, StudioCanal has released a number of the \"Carry On\" films on Blu-ray, beginning with \"Carry On Screaming!\" (21 October 2013), \"Carry On Cleo\" (5 May 2014), \"Carry On Cowboy\" (2 June 2014) and \"Carry On Jack\" (7 July 2014).\nCultural influence.\nThe success of the \"Carry On\" series occasionally led to affectionate parodies of the series by other contemporary comedians:\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "37000", "revid": "1307165987", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37000", "title": "Palmer Raids", "text": "United States government arrests of leftists, 1919\u201320\nThe Palmer Raids were a series of raids conducted in November 1919 and January 1920 by the United States Department of Justice under the administration of President Woodrow Wilson to capture and arrest suspected socialists, especially anarchists and communists, and deport them from the United States. The raids particularly targeted Italian immigrants and Eastern European Jewish immigrants with alleged leftist ties, with particular focus on Italian anarchists and immigrant leftist labor activists. The raids and arrests occurred under the leadership of United States Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer, with 6,000 people arrested across 36 cities. Though 556 foreign citizens were deported, including a number of prominent leftist leaders, Palmer's efforts were largely frustrated by officials at the U.S. Department of Labor, which had authority for deportations and objected to Palmer's methods.\nThe Palmer Raids occurred in the larger context of the First Red Scare, a period of reactionary fear of communists in the U.S. in the years immediately following World War I and the successful Russian Revolution. There were strikes that garnered national attention, and prompted race riots in more than 30 cities, as well as two sets of bombings in April and June 1919, including one bomb mailed to Palmer's home in response to his policy of politically motivated mass arrests and deportations.\nBackground.\nDuring the First World War there was a nationwide right-wing campaign in the United States against the real and imagined divided political loyalties of immigrants and ethnic groups, who were feared to have too much loyalty for their nations of origin. In 1915, President Wilson warned against hyphenated Americans who, he charged, had \"poured the poison of disloyalty into the very arteries of our national life.\" \"Such creatures of passion, disloyalty and anarchy\", Wilson continued, \"must be crushed out\". The Russian Revolutions of 1917 added special force to fear of labor agitators and partisans of ideologies such as anarchism and communism. The general strike in Seattle in February 1919 represented a new development in labor unrest.\nThe fears of Wilson and other government officials were confirmed when Galleanists\u2014Italian immigrant followers of the anarchist Luigi Galleani\u2014carried out a series of bombings in April and June 1919. At the end of April, some 30 Galleanist letter bombs had been mailed to a host of individuals, mostly prominent government officials and businessmen, but also law enforcement officials. Only a few reached their targets, and not all exploded when opened. Some people suffered injuries, including a housekeeper in Senator Thomas W. Hardwick's residence, who had her hands blown off. On June 2, 1919, the second wave of bombings occurred, when several much larger package bombs were detonated by Galleanists in eight American cities, including one that damaged the home of Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer in Washington, D.C. At least one person was killed in this second attack, night watchman William Boehner, and fears were raised because it occurred in the capital. Flyers declaring war on capitalists in the name of anarchist principles accompanied each bomb.\nPreparations.\nIn June 1919, Attorney General Palmer told the House Appropriations Committee that all evidence promised that radicals would \"on a certain day...rise up and destroy the government at one fell swoop.\" He requested an increase in his budget to $2,000,000 from $1,500,000 to support his investigations of radicals, but Congress limited the increase to $100,000.\nAn initial raid in July 1919 against an anarchist group in Buffalo, New York, achieved little when a federal judge tossed out Palmer's case. He found in the case that the three arrested radicals, charged under a law dating from the Civil War, had proposed transforming the government by using their free speech rights and not by violence. That taught Palmer that he needed to exploit the more powerful immigration statutes that authorized the deportation of alien anarchists, violent or not. To do that, he needed to enlist the cooperation of officials at the Department of Labor. Only the Secretary of Labor could issue warrants for the arrest of alien violators of the Immigration Acts, and only he could sign deportation orders following a hearing by an immigration inspector.\nOn August 1, 1919, Palmer named 24-year-old J. Edgar Hoover to head a new division of the Justice Department's , the General Intelligence Division (GID), with responsibility for investigating the programs of radical groups and identifying their members. The Boston Police Strike in early September raised concerns about possible threats to political and social stability. On October 17, the Senate passed a unanimous resolution demanding Palmer explain what actions he had or had not taken against radical aliens and why.\nAt 9\u00a0p.m. on November 7, 1919, a date chosen because it was the second anniversary of the Bolshevik revolution, agents of the Bureau of Investigation, together with local police, executed a series of well-publicized and violent raids against the Union of Russian Workers in 12 cities. Newspaper accounts reported some were \"badly beaten\" during the arrests. Many later swore they were threatened and beaten during questioning. Government agents cast a wide net, bringing in some American citizens, passers-by who admitted being Russian, some not members of the Russian Workers. Others were teachers conducting night school classes in space shared with the targeted radical group. Arrests far exceeded the number of warrants. Of 650 arrested in New York City, the government managed to deport just 43.\nWhen Palmer replied to the Senate's questions of October 17, he reported that his department had amassed 60,000 names with great effort. Required by the statutes to work through the Department of Labor, they had arrested 250 dangerous radicals in the November 7 raids. He proposed a new Anti-Sedition Law to enhance his authority to prosecute anarchists.\nRaids and arrests in January 1920.\nInasmuch as Attorney General Palmer struggled with exhaustion and devoted all his energies to the United Mine Workers coal strike in November and December 1919, Hoover organized the next raids. He successfully persuaded the Department of Labor to ease its insistence on promptly alerting those arrested of their right to an attorney. Instead, Labor issued instructions that its representatives could wait until after the case against the defendant was established, \"in order to protect government interests.\" Less openly, Hoover decided to interpret Labor's agreement to act against the Communist Party to include a different organization, the Communist Labor Party. Finally, despite the fact that Secretary of Labor William B. Wilson insisted that more than membership in an organization was required for a warrant, Hoover worked with more compliant Labor officials and overwhelmed Labor staff to get the warrants he wanted. Justice Department officials, including Palmer and Hoover, later claimed ignorance of such details.\nThe Justice Department launched a series of raids on January 2, 1920, with follow up operations over the next few days. Smaller raids extended over the next 6 weeks. At least 3,000 were arrested, and many others were held for various lengths of time. The entire enterprise replicated the November action on a larger scale, including arrests and seizures without search warrants, as well as detention in overcrowded and unsanitary holding facilities. Hoover later admitted \"clear cases of brutality.\" The raids covered more than 30 cities and towns in 23 states, but those west of the Mississippi and south of the Ohio were \"publicity gestures\" designed to make the effort appear nationwide in scope. Because the raids targeted entire organizations, agents arrested everyone found in organization meeting halls, not only arresting non-radical organization members but also visitors who did not belong to a target organization, and sometimes American citizens not eligible for arrest and deportation.\nThe Department of Justice at one point claimed to have taken possession of several bombs, but after a few iron balls were displayed to the press they were never mentioned again. All the raids netted a total of just four ordinary pistols.\nWhile most press coverage continued to be positive, with criticism only from leftist publications like \"The Nation\" and \"The New Republic\", one attorney raised the first noteworthy protest. Francis Fisher Kane, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, resigned in protest. In his letter of resignation to the President and the Attorney General he wrote: \"It seems to me that the policy of raids against large numbers of individuals is generally unwise and very apt to result in injustice. People not really guilty are likely to be arrested and railroaded through their hearings... We appear to be attempting to repress a political party... By such methods, we drive underground and make dangerous what was not dangerous before.\" Palmer replied that he could not use individual arrests to treat an \"epidemic\" and asserted his own fidelity to constitutional principles. He added: \"The Government should encourage free political thinking and political action, but it certainly has the right for its own preservation to discourage and prevent the use of force and violence to accomplish that which ought to be accomplished, if at all, by parliamentary or political methods.\" \"The Washington Post\" endorsed Palmer's claim for urgency over legal process: \"There is no time to waste on hairsplitting over infringement of liberty.\"\nAftermath.\nIn a few weeks, after changes in personnel at the Department of Labor, Palmer faced a new and very independent-minded Acting Secretary of Labor in Assistant Secretary of Labor Louis Freeland Post, who canceled more than 2,000 warrants as being illegal. Of the 10,000 arrested, 3,500 were held by authorities in detention; 556 resident aliens were eventually deported under the Immigration Act of 1918.\nAt a Cabinet meeting in April 1920, Palmer called on Secretary of Labor William B. Wilson to fire Post, but Wilson defended him. The President listened to his feuding department heads and offered no comment about Post, but he ended the meeting by telling Palmer that he should \"not let this country see red.\" Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels, who made notes of the conversation, thought the Attorney General had merited the President's \"admonition\", because Palmer \"was seeing red behind every bush and every demand for an increase in wages.\"\nPalmer's supporters in Congress responded with an attempt to impeach Louis Post or, failing that, to censure him. The drive against Post began to lose energy when Attorney General Palmer's forecast of an attempted radical uprising on May Day 1920 failed to occur. Then, in testimony before the House Rules Committee on May 7\u20138, Post proved \"a convincing speaker with a caustic tongue\" and defended himself so successfully that Congressman Edward W. Pou, a Democrat presumed to be an enthusiastic supporter of Palmer, congratulated him: \"I feel that you have followed your sense of duty absolutely.\" \nOn May 28, 1920, the nascent American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which was founded in response to the raids, published its \"Report Upon the Illegal Practices of the United States Department of Justice\", which carefully documented unlawful activities in arresting suspected radicals, illegal entrapment by \"agents provocateur\", and unlawful incommunicado detention. Such prominent lawyers and law professors as Felix Frankfurter, Roscoe Pound and Ernst Freund signed it. Harvard Professor Zechariah Chafee criticized the raids and attempts at deportations and the lack of legal process in his 1920 volume \"Freedom of Speech\". He wrote: \"That a Quaker should employ prison and exile to counteract evil-thinking is one of the saddest ironies of our time.\"\nThe Rules Committee gave Palmer a hearing in June, where he attacked Post and other critics whose \"tender solicitude for social revolution and perverted sympathy for the criminal anarchists...set at large among the people the very public enemies whom it was the desire and intention of the Congress to be rid of.\" The press saw the dispute as evidence of the Wilson administration's ineffectiveness and division as it approached its final months.\nIn June 1920, a decision by Massachusetts District Court Judge George W. Anderson ordered the discharge of 17 arrested aliens and denounced the Department of Justice's actions. He wrote that \"a mob is a mob, whether made up of Government officials acting under instructions from the Department of Justice, or of criminals and loafers and the vicious classes.\" His decision effectively prevented any renewal of the raids. \nPalmer, once seen as a likely presidential candidate, lost his bid to win the Democratic nomination for president later in the year. The anarchist bombing campaign, following the ideology of propaganda of the deed, continued intermittently in the US for another twelve years.\nEpilogue.\nThe legal issues involved in the 1919 Palmer Raids during the Woodrow Wilson administration have been resurrected during the deportations during the second Trump administration.\nCurrent Trump administration policy has been compared to the Palmer Raids, and the \"Repatriations\" of the 1930s\":\nFormer President Donald Trump's call for historic \"mass deportations\" of immigrants from the United States is forcing the nation to revisit past expulsions that left deep wounds still felt today.\nThe big picture: From the Palmer Raids of Jewish and Italian immigrants of 1919 to the mass deportation of Mexican immigrants in the 1950s, previous deportation operations ignored civil liberties, heightened racial tensions and disrupted families of American citizens for generations.\nIt has also been compared to the Irish Expulsion, the Palmer Raids and the \u201cSoviet Ark\u201d, the \u201cMexican Repatriation\u201d during The Great Depression, \u201cOperation Wetback\u201d during the Dwight D. Eisenhower administration, and \"The Deporter-in-Chief\" during the Barack Obama administration.\nIn the 105 years between 1892 and 1997, the United States deported 2.1 million people. Between 2001 and 2008, during the Presidency of George W. Bush, about 2.0 million people were deported, while between 2009 and 2016, during the Presidency of Barack Obama, about 3.2 million people were deported.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The typical prayer rope has thirty-three knots, representing the thirty-three years of Christ's life. It is employed by monastics, and sometimes by others, to count the number of times one has prayed the Jesus Prayer (or occasionally other prayers).\nPrayer ropes are part of the practice of Eastern Christian monks and nuns, particularly within Eastern Orthodoxy, Eastern Catholicism, and Oriental Orthodoxy. Among the Coptic, Ethiopian, and Eritrean Orthodox Churches, a prayer rope is known by its Coptic or Ge'ez name ().\nDescription.\nHistorically, the prayer rope would typically have 100 knots, although prayer ropes with 150, 60, 50, 33, 64 or 41 knots can also be found in use today. There are even small 10-knot prayer ropes intended to be worn on the finger. Hermits in their cells may have prayer ropes with as many as 300 or 500 knots in them.\nCharacteristically, the knots of a prayer rope are diamond knots (ABoK #787).\nThere is typically a knotted cross where the prayer rope is joined together to form a loop, and a few beads at certain intervals between the knots (usually every 10 or 25 knots) for ease in counting. Longer prayer ropes frequently have a tassel at the end of the cross; its purpose is to dry the tears shed due to heartfelt compunction for one's sins. The tassel can also be said to represent the glory of the Heavenly Kingdom, which one can enter only through the Cross. Additionally, the tassel represents an inherited tradition of prayer. The symbol of tassels as tradition coming from Old Testament commandments to Jews to wear tassels on their garments to keep in mind the received laws.\nThe prayer rope is commonly made out of wool, symbolizing the flock of Christ; though in modern times other materials are used also. The traditional color of the rope is black (symbolizing mourning for one's sins), with either black or colored beads. The beads (if they are colored) and at least a portion of the tassel are traditionally red, symbolizing the blood of Christ and the blood of the martyrs. In recent times, however, prayer ropes have been made in a wide variety of colors.\nAmong the Oriental Orthodox, the prayer rope is composed of 41, 64, or 100 beads and is primarily used to recite the Kyrie Eleison (Lord, have mercy) prayer as well as others such as the Lord's Prayer and the Magnificat. In regards to the first two numbers, the first number represents the number of lashes inflicted on Jesus (39 according to Jewish custom) alongside the lance wound and crown of thorns, while the latter represents Mary's age upon her Assumption respectively.\nUse.\nWhen praying, the user normally holds the prayer rope in the left hand, leaving the right hand free to make the Sign of the Cross. When not in use, the prayer rope is traditionally wrapped around the left wrist so that it continues to remind one to pray without ceasing. If this is impractical, it may be placed in the (left) pocket, but should not be hung around the neck or suspended from the belt. The reason for this is humility: one should not be ostentatious or conspicuous in displaying the prayer rope for others to see.\nDuring their tonsure (religious profession), Eastern Orthodox monks and nuns receive a prayer rope, with the words:\nAccept, O brother (sister) \"(name)\", the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God (Ephesians 6:17) in the everlasting Jesus prayer by which you should have the name of the Lord in your soul, your thoughts, and your heart, saying always: \"Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me a sinner.\"\nOrthodoxy regards the prayer rope as the sword of the Spirit, because prayer which is heartfelt and inspired by the grace of the Holy Spirit is a weapon that defeats the Devil.\nAmong some Orthodox monastics (and occasionally other faithful), the canonical hours and preparation for Holy Communion may be replaced by praying the Jesus Prayer a specified number of times dependent on the service being replaced. In this way prayers can still be said even if the service books are for some reason unavailable or the person is not literate or otherwise unable to recite the service; the prayer rope becomes a very practical tool in such cases, simply for keeping count of the prayers said. However, among some monastics, e.g. hesychasts, this replacement is the norm.\nOne scheme for replacing the Divine Services with the Jesus Prayer and prostrations is as follows:\nInstead of the entire Psalter: 6,000 Jesus Prayers and prostrations\nOne kathisma of the Psalter: 300 prayers and prostrations (100 for each stasis)\nMidnight Office: 600\nMatins: 1,500\nThe Hours without the Inter-Hours: 1000;\nThe Hours with the Inter-Hours: 1,500\nVespers: 600\nGreat Compline: 700\nSmall Compline: 400\nA Canon or Akathist to the Most Holy Theotokos (Mother of God): 500\nOver the centuries, various cell rules have developed to help the individual in the daily use of the prayer rope. However, there is no single, standardized method in use universally throughout the Church. There may be prostrations after each prayer or after a certain number of prayers, depending upon the particular rule being followed.\nNot only is the Jesus Prayer used, but Eastern Christians also have many \"breath prayers\". Contrary to thought, they are not to be said using spiritual breathing, as that can only be determined by a spiritual father. Breath prayers continuously repeated on the prayer rope may include: Lord Have Mercy, Come Lord Jesus, Lord I Believe...Help My Unbelief, Lord Save Me, etc.\nWearing.\nAmong Orthodox believers, small 33-knot prayer ropes are frequently worn around the wrist. Some Orthodox may wear a large 100-knot prayer rope around their neck,\nHowever, this is considered incorrect by the vast majority of Orthodox churches; the rope is to always be worn around the left wrist (sometimes also woven between fingers) when not in use.\nHistory.\nThe history of the prayer rope goes back to the origins of Christian monasticism itself. The invention of the prayer rope is attributed to Pachomius the Great in the fourth century as an aid for illiterate monks to accomplish a consistent number of prayers and prostrations in their cells. Previously, monks would count their prayers by casting pebbles into a bowl, but this was cumbersome, and could not be easily carried about when outside the cell. The use of the rope made it possible to pray the Jesus Prayer unceasingly, whether inside the cell or out, in accordance with Paul the Apostle's injunction to \"Pray without ceasing\" (I Thessalonians 5:17).\nIt is said that the method of tying the prayer rope had its origins from the father of Orthodox monasticism, Anthony the Great. He started by tying a leather rope with a simple knot for every time he prayed Kyrie Eleison (\"Lord have Mercy\"), but the Devil would come and untie the knots to throw off his count. He then devised a way\u2014inspired by a vision he had of the Theotokos\u2014of tying the knots so that the knots themselves would constantly make the sign of the cross. This is why prayer ropes today are still tied using knots that each contain seven little crosses being tied over and over. The Devil could not untie it because the Devil is vanquished by the Sign of the Cross.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "37004", "revid": "7080218", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37004", "title": "Greco-Roman mysteries", "text": "Religious schools of the Greco-Roman world\nMystery religions, mystery cults, sacred mysteries or simply mysteries (), were religious schools of the Greco-Roman world for which participation was reserved to initiates \"(mystai)\". The main characteristic of these religious schools was the secrecy associated with the particulars of the initiation and the ritual practice, which may not be revealed to outsiders. The most famous mysteries of Greco-Roman antiquity were the Eleusinian Mysteries, which predated the Greek Dark Ages. The mystery schools flourished in Late Antiquity; Emperor Julian, of the mid-4th century, is believed by some scholars to have been associated with various mystery cults\u2014most notably the mithraists. Due to the secret nature of the schools, and because the mystery religions of Late Antiquity were persecuted by the Christian Roman Empire from the 4th century, the details of these religious practices are derived from descriptions, imagery and cross-cultural studies.\nJustin Martyr in the 2nd century explicitly noted and identified them as \"demonic imitations\" of the true faith; \"the devils, in imitation of what was said by Moses, asserted that Proserpine was the daughter of Jupiter, and instigated the people to set up an image of her under the name of Kore\" (\"First Apology\"). Through the 1st to 4th century, Christianity stood in direct competition for adherents with the mystery schools.\nEtymology.\nThe English word 'mystery' originally appeared as the Ancient Greek plural 'the Mysteries', and developed into the Latin , where the English term originates. The etymology of the Greek \"must\u1e17rion\" 'revealed secret' is not entirely clear, though scholars have traditionally thought it to have derived from the Greek 'to close, shut; to be shut (especially of the eyes)' (chiefly referring to shutting the eyes, hence one who shuts their eyes and is initiated into the mysteries). Hittite scholar Jaan Puhvel suggests that the Greek term derives from the Hittite verb \"munnae\" 'to conceal, to hide, to shut out of sight'.\nCharacteristics.\nMystery religions formed one of three types of Hellenistic religion, the others being the imperial cult, or the ethnic religion particular to a nation or state, and the philosophic religions such as Neoplatonism.\nThis is also reflected in the tripartite division of \"theology\"\u2014by Varro\u2014into civil theology (concerning the state religion and its stabilizing effect on society), natural theology (philosophical speculation about the nature of the divine), and mythical theology (concerning myth and ritual).\nMysteries thus supplement rather than compete with civil religion. An individual could easily observe the rites of the state religion, be an initiate in one or more mysteries, and at the same time adhere to a certain philosophical school. Many of the aspects of public religion such as sacrifices, ritual meals, and ritual purification were repeated within the mystery, but with the additional requirement that they take place in secrecy and be confined to a closed set of initiates. The mystery schools offered a niche for the preservation of ancient religious ritual, which was especially in demand by the time of the late Roman Empire, as cultic practices supported the established social and political orders instead of working against them; numerous early strands of Judaism and Christianity, for instance, appeared in opposition to such conditions, whereas the mystery cults, by their very nature, served to strengthen the status quo.\nFor this reason, what evidence remains of the older Greek mysteries has been understood as reflecting certain archaic aspects of common Indo-European religion, with parallels in Indo-Iranian religion. The mystery schools of Greco-Roman antiquity include the Eleusinian Mysteries, the Dionysian Mysteries, and the Orphic Mysteries. Some of the many divinities that the Romans nominally adopted from other cultures also came to be worshipped in Mysteries; for instance, Egyptian Isis, Persian Mithras from the Mithraic Mysteries, Thracian/Phrygian Sabazius, and Phrygian Cybele.\nIn Plato's \"Meno\", the character Meno had intended to leave Athens \"before the mysteries\", but agrees to stay longer so as to extend his discussion with Socrates about whether virtue can be taught.\nEleusinian Mysteries.\nThe Eleusinian Mysteries were the earliest and most famous of the mystery cults and lasted for over a millennium. Whenever they first originated, by the end of the 5th century BCE, they had been heavily influenced by Orphism, and in Late Antiquity, they had become allegorized.\nMyth.\nThe basis for the Eleusinian Mysteries can be found in a myth concerning the kidnapping of Persephone, daughter of Demeter, the goddess of agriculture, by Hades, the god of the underworld, as told in the Homeric Hymns. Anguished by this event and wishing to persuade Zeus, the king of the gods, to allow the return of her daughter, Demeter caused famine and drought across the land, killing many and depriving the gods of proper sacrifice and worship. Eventually, Zeus permitted Persephone to rejoin her mother, prompting Demeter to end the pestilences which deprived the world of its prosperity. However, because the Fates decreed that whoever ate or drank in the underworld was doomed to spend eternity there, Persephone was still forced to remain in the realm for either four or six months of the year (depending on the telling), as she was tricked by Hades into eating pomegranate seeds of a corresponding amount. Thus, Demeter, in her sadness, neglects to nourish the earth for the months that Persephone is gone, only doing so when she returns, until the process repeats again. These episodic periods became the winter and spring seasons, with the \"death\" and \"rebirth\" of Persephone being allegorical for the cycle of life and the experience of all beings.\nInitiation.\nIn the 15th of the month of Boedromion (September/October) in the Attic calendar, as many as 3,000 potential initiates would have gathered in the agora of Athens, the gathering limited to those that spoke Greek and had never killed (as the emphasis on purity grew, this ban would include those who had \"impure\" souls). Like other large festivals such as the Diasia and Thesmophoria, the prospective initiates would bring their own sacrificial animals and hear the festivals proclamation as it began. The next day, they would have gone to the sea and purified themselves and the animals. Three days of rest would pass until the 19th, the agora was once more filled with the initiates at the procession at the sanctuary of Demeter and her daughter Persephone. Two Eleusinian priestesses were at the front of the procession followed by many Greeks holding special items in preparation for the rest of the ceremony, and the procession would leave the city on an hours-long 15-mile journey constantly interrupted by celebration, dances, etc, to the city of Eleusis. The initiates would carry torches on the way to the city. Once the city was reached, the pilgrims would dance into the sanctuary. The next day would begin with sacrifices, and at sunset, the initiates would go to a building called the \"telest\u00earion\" where the actual initiations would commence. The initiates washed themselves to be pure and everyone sat together in silence surrounded by the smell of extinguished torches. The initiation may have taken place over two nights. If so, the first night may have concerned the kidnapping of Persephone by Hades and ended with the goddess's return, whereas the second night concerned the \"epopteia\" (the higher degree of the Mysteries) which was a performance that included singing, dancing, potentially the showing of a phallus, a terrifying experience for the audience by the skilled Eleusinian clergy, and the climax of the event which must have included displaying a statue of Demeter and showing of an ear of wheat and a \"birth\" of agricultural wealth. Hence, these mysteries had associations with fertility and agriculture. In an attempt to solve the mystery of how so many people over the span of two millennia could have consistently experienced revelatory states during the culminating ceremony of the Eleusinian Mysteries, numerous scholars have proposed that the power of the Eleusinian Mysteries came from the kykeon's functioning as an entheogen.\nAftermath.\nThe day of the completion of the initiation was called the Plemochoai (after a type of vessel used to conclude a libation), and the new members could now wear a myrtle wreath like the priests. Eventually, the initiates would leave and utter the phrases \"paks\" or \"konks\", which referenced the proclamation of a conclusion of an event. The clothing worn by the new members during their journey were used as lucky blankets for children or perhaps were given to their sanctuary.\nSamothracian Mysteries.\nThe second most famous Mysteries were those on the island of Samothrace and promised safety to sailors from the perils of the sea, and most participants would come to be initiated from the neighboring regions. While the information here is even more scarce than that available with the Eleusinian Mysteries (and more late, dating to the Hellenistic and Roman periods), it's known that the Samothracian Mysteries significantly borrowed from the ones at Eleusis (including the word 'Mysteries'), furthermore, archaeological and linguistic data continues elucidating more of what happened at Samothrace. These rituals were also associated with others on neighboring island such as the mysteries of the deities of Cabeiri. Philip II of Macedon and his later wife Olympias were said to have met during the initiation ceremony at Samothrace. Heracles, Jason, Cadmus, Orpheus and the Dioscuri were all said to have been initiated here.\nMyth.\nLittle is known about any core foundational myths for the entities worshipped by cult initiates at Samothrace; even their identities are unknown, as they tended to be discussed anonymously, being referred to as the \"Samothracian gods\" or the \"Great Gods\". This makes it difficult to reconstruct who they were, though comparisons between the \"gods of Samothrace\" and the Cabeiri, chthonic deities of an indeterminate amount (sometimes twins, or multiple distinct beings) from comparable, pre-Greek or entirely non-Greek cultures such as Thrace or Phrygia have been made. The similarities in regards to what each deity or set of deities were purported to offer\u2014protection on the seas and help in difficult times\u2014display a definite connection, though to what extent is impossible to conclude. It is therefore likely that if the Samothracian gods are not the Cabeiri themselves, elements from this comparative religion, along with Thracian elements of worship present on the island before an established Greek presence, heavily influenced the ideas and practices central to the mystery cult.\nInitiation.\nUnlike at Eleusis, initiation at Samothrace was not restricted to a narrow few days of the year and lasted from April to November (the sailing season) with a large event likely taking place in June but may have taken place over two nights. Like in Samothrace, the future initiates would enter the sanctuary of Samothrace from the east where they would have entered into a 9-meter in diameter circular space with flagstones and a grandstand of five steps now called the Theatral Circle. Livy records that here, the initiates would listen to a proclamation concerning the absence of crime and bloodshed. Near the beginning of the rituals, like at Eleusis, sacrifices and libations were likely made, where the prospective animal for the sacrifice would have been a ram. The initiates would have moved to a building where the actual initiation took place at night with torches, though archaeologists are unsure of which building it was considering the abundance of possibilities including the Hall of Choral Dancers, the Hieron, the Anaktoron and the Rotunda of Arsinoe II. In the 3rd century, Hippolytus of Rome in his \"Refutation of All Heresies\" quotes a Gnostic author who provides a summary of some of the images here;\nThere stand two statues of naked men in the Anaktoron of the Samothracians, with both hands stretched up toward heaven and their pudenda turned up, just as the statue of Hermes at Kyllene. The aforesaid statues are images of the primal man and of the regenerated, spiritual man who is in every respect consubstantial with that man.\nThe scarcity of information precludes understanding what went on during the initiation, though there may have been dancing such as at Eleusis associated with the mythology of the search for Harmonia. At the end of the initiation, the initiates were given a purple fillet. There was also a second night of initiation, the \"epopteia\" where the \"usual preliminary lustration rites and sacrifices\" took place though not much else can be known besides that it may have been similar to the \"epopteia\" at Eleusis and would have climaxed with the showing of a great light.\nAftermath.\nThe initiation of the first night was concluded by banqueting together and many dining rooms have been uncovered by archaeologists in association with the cult at Samothrace. The bowls used for the libation were also left behind, revealed by the thousands of discovered libation bowls at the cult sites. The participants occasionally left behind other materials, such as lamps. In addition to the purple fillet, they also left with a 'Samothracian ring' (magnetic iron ring coated in gold) and some initiates would set up a record of their initiation in the stoa of the sanctuary. The initiation of the second night was also concluded by a banquet.\nMithraic Mysteries.\nWorship of the god Mithras was extremely popular among men of the Roman army for several centuries, originating in the 1st century BCE and ending with the persecution of non-Christian faiths within the Empire in the 4th century CE. Imported from Persia and adapted for Roman purposes like many other previously foreign deities, Mithras bears little relation to his Zoroastrian precursor, Mithra, retaining his Phrygian cap and garments, for instance, as a visual reminder of his eastern origins. The cultic acts of adherents were new and distinct, involving underground initiation rituals reserved exclusively for soldiers and complex, allegorical rites only vaguely understood today due to an absence of written sources. Feasting was the primary religious experience of initiated members, along with reenactments of core Mithraic imagery, such as the meal shared between the god Sol Invictus and Mithras, or the bearing of torches by men representing the twins of the rising and setting sun, Cautes and Cautopates.\nMyth.\nTraditionally, scholarship surrounding Mithras' mythological beginnings purport that followers believed the common image of the god emerging from a rock, already a young man, with a dagger in one hand and a torch in the other, was representative of his birth and nativity. New perspectives have appeared in light of continuous study which suppose that this scene instead displays the popular Roman religio-philosophical theme of ascent, whereby the god's emergence from the stone serves to depict his divinity and power over \"earthly mundaneness\". The visual and metaphorical components to the core cult image of Mithras slaying a bull, known as the tauroctony, have also been greatly debated. Propositions that the scene depicts nothing more than the act of sacrifice, well known to Romans through their civil religions and obligatory state festivals, have been accepted for some time, but belief that the scene displays a star-map of major constellations in addition to the usual action of sacrifice has appeared in recent years. As is the case with most other mystery religions, almost no written sources pertaining to the practices, much less the beliefs of adherents, survive. Thus, conjecture and assumption based almost exclusively on archaeological finds and modern interpretations provide only somewhat of a vague understanding.\nInitiation.\nA system of grades or levels was present in the hierarchical structure of Mithraic religion, the first of these being the rank of \"Corax\" (raven), followed by \"Nymphus\" or \"Gryphus\" (bridegroom), \"Miles\" (soldier), \"Leo\" (lion), \"Perses\" (Persian), \"Heliodromus\" (sun-runner), and finally \"Pater\" (father) as the highest. Though precise details are difficult to determine and certainly varied between locations, one general depiction of an initiation ritual at Capua has it that men were blindfolded and walked into the subterranean chamber known as a Mithraeum where the rites and practices of the cult would be performed. Initiates were naked, bound with their arms behind them, and knelt before a priest, whereupon they would be released from their bondage, crowned, but not permitted to rise until a particular moment. The initiation was confirmed by a handshake, as members would henceforth be referred to as \"syndexioi\", or those \"united by the handshake\". Little is known about the cult's practices subsequent to initiation, as the highly secretive nature of the religion as well as a substantial absence of written texts makes it difficult to determine what precisely took place in regular meetings, beyond the payment of a membership fee. \u00a0\nContemporary revival.\nThe religious association \"Pietas Comunit\u00e0 Gentile\" actively sustains the lineage of Greco\u2011Roman mystery cults through public rites such as the \"Dionisiache\", nowadays held in the cloister of the former Reformed Fathers\u2019 Convent in Pulsano. In collaboration with the Pulsano Archaeological Museum and local authorities, the community stages symbolic\u2011ritual performances dedicated to Artemis and Dionysus, integrating shamanic drumming, sacred chants, and initiatory symbolism drawn from ancient Roman religion. As part of its mission to revive the ancient Roman Cultus Deorum, Pietas has also constructed two fully active temples in the Ionian region\u2014one to Apollo and one to Minerva\u2014thus re\u2011establishing living centers for esoteric practice in the modern era.\nPossible influence on early Christianity.\nTowards the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century, it was becoming more popular in German scholarship to connect the origins of Christianity with heavy influence from the mystery cults, if not labeling Christianity itself as a mystery cult. This trend was partly the result of the increasing growth of critical historical analysis of Christianity's history, as exemplified by David Strauss's (1835\u201336) and the secularizing trend among scholars that sought to derive Christianity from its pagan surroundings. Scholars, for example, began attempting to derive Paul's theology from a Mithraic mystery cult in Tarsus, even though no mystery cult existed there nor did a Mithraic mystery cult exist before the end of the 1st century. The attitudes of scholars began to change as Egyptology continued emerging as a discipline and a seminal article published by Arthur Nock in 1952 that noted the near absence of mystery terminology in the New Testament. While some have tried to tie the origins of rites in Christianity such as baptism and the Eucharist to mystery religions, it has been demonstrated that the origins of baptism rather lie in Jewish purificatory ritual and that cult meals were so widespread in the ancient world that attempting to demonstrate their origins from any one source is arbitrary. Searches for Christianity deriving content from mystery religions has also been unsuccessful; many of them (such as the mysteries of Eleusis and Samothrace) had no content but rather limited themselves to showing objects in initiation.\nLater interaction between Christianity and mystery religions did take place. Christianity has its own initiation ritual, baptism, and beginning in the fourth century, Christians began to refer to their sacraments, such as baptism, with the word \"mysterion\", the Greek term that was also used for a mystery rite. In this case, the word meant that Christians did not discuss their most important rites with non-Christians who might misunderstand or disrespect them. Their rites thus acquired some of the aura of secrecy that surrounded the mystery cults.\nEven in ancient times these similarities were controversial. Non-Christians in the Roman Empire in the early centuries CE, such as Lucian and Celsus, thought Christianity and the mystery cults resembled each other. Reacting to these claims by outsiders, early Christian apologists, such as Justin Martyr, denied that these cults had influenced their religion. The seventeenth-century Protestant scholar Isaac Casaubon brought up the issue again by accusing the Catholic Church of deriving its sacraments from the rituals of the mystery cults. Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Dupuis, in the late eighteenth century, went further by claiming that Christianity itself sprang from the mystery cults. Intensified by religious disputes between Protestants, Catholics, and non-Christians, the controversy has continued to the present day.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The term \"communist party\" was popularized by the title of \"The Manifesto of the Communist Party\" (1848) by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. As a vanguard party, the communist party guides the political education and development of the working class (proletariat). As a ruling party, the communist party exercises power through the dictatorship of the proletariat. Vladimir Lenin developed the idea of the communist party as the revolutionary vanguard, when the socialist movement in Imperial Russia was divided into ideologically opposed factions, the Bolshevik faction (\"of the majority\") and the Menshevik faction (\"of the minority\"). To be politically effective, Lenin proposed a small vanguard party managed with democratic centralism which allowed the centralized command of a disciplined cadre of professional revolutionaries. Once a policy was agreed upon, realizing political goals required every Bolshevik's total commitment to the agreed-upon policy.\nIn contrast, the Menshevik faction, which initially included Leon Trotsky, emphasized that the party should not neglect the importance of mass populations in realizing a communist revolution. In the course of the revolution, the Bolshevik party which became the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) assumed government power in Russia after the October Revolution in 1917. With the creation of the Communist International (Comintern) in 1919, the concept of communist party leadership was adopted by many revolutionary parties, worldwide. In an effort to standardize the international communist movement ideologically and maintain central control of the member parties, the Comintern required that its members use the term \"communist party\" in their names.\nUnder the leadership of the CPSU, the interpretations of orthodox Marxism were applied to Russia and led to the emergence of Leninist and Marxist\u2013Leninist political parties throughout the world. After the death of Lenin, the Comintern's official interpretation of Leninism was the book \"Foundations of Leninism\" (1924) by Joseph Stalin.\nMass organizations.\nAs the membership of a communist party was to be limited to \nactive cadres in Lenin's theory, there was a need for networks of separate organizations to mobilize mass support for the party. Typically, communist parties built up various front organizations whose membership was often open to non-communists. In many countries, the single most important front organization of the communist parties was its youth wing. During the time of the Communist International, the youth leagues were explicit communist organizations, using the name 'Young Communist League'. Later the youth league concept was broadened in many countries, and names like 'Democratic Youth League' were adopted.\nSome trade unions and students', women's, peasants', and cultural organizations have been connected to communist parties. Traditionally, these mass organizations were often politically subordinated to the political leadership of the party. After the fall of communist party regimes in the 1990s, mass organizations sometimes outlived their communist party founders.\nAt the international level, the Communist International organized various international front organizations (linking national mass organizations with each other), such as the Young Communist International, Profintern, Krestintern, International Red Aid, Sportintern, etc. Many of these organizations were disbanded after the dissolution of the Communist International. After the Second World War new international coordination bodies were created, such as the World Federation of Democratic Youth, International Union of Students, World Federation of Trade Unions, Women's International Democratic Federation and the World Peace Council. The Soviet Union unified many of the Comintern's original goals in the Eastern Bloc under the aegis of a new organization, the Cominform.\nHistorically, in countries where communist parties were struggling to attain state power, the formation of wartime alliances with non-communist parties and wartime groups was enacted (such as the National Liberation Front of Albania). Upon attaining state power these Fronts were often transformed into nominal (and usually electoral) \"National\" or \"Fatherland\" Fronts in which non-communist parties and organizations were given token representation (a practice known as \"Blockpartei\"), the most popular examples of these being the National Front of East Germany (as a historical example) and the North Korean Reunification Front (as a modern-day example). Other times the formation of such Fronts was undertaken without the participation of other parties, such as the Socialist Alliance of Working People of Yugoslavia and the National Front of Afghanistan, though the purpose was the same: to promote the communist party line to generally non-communist audiences and to mobilize them to carry out tasks within the country under the aegis of the Front.\nRecent scholarship has developed the comparative political study of global communist parties by examining similarities and differences across historical geographies. In particular, the rise of revolutionary parties, their spread internationally, the appearance of charismatic revolutionary leaders and their ultimate demise during the decline and fall of communist parties worldwide have all been the subject of investigation.\nNaming.\nA uniform naming scheme for communist parties was adopted by the Communist International. All parties were required to use the name 'Communist Party of (\"name of the country\")', resulting in separate communist parties in some countries operating using (largely) homonymous party names (e.g. in India). Today, there are a few cases where the original sections of the Communist International have retained those names. But throughout the twentieth century, many parties changed their names. For example, following their ascension to power, the Bolshevik Party changed their name to the All-Russian Communist Party. Causes for these shifts in naming were either moves to avoid state repression or as measures to generate greater acceptance by local populations.\nAn important example of the latter was the renaming of many East European communist parties after the Second World War, sometimes as a result of mergers with the local social democratic and democratic socialist parties. New names in the post-war era included \"Socialist Party\", \"Socialist Unity Party\", \"People's (or Popular) Party\", \"Workers' Party\" and \"Party of Labour\".\nThe naming conventions of communist parties became more diverse as the international communist movement was fragmented due to the Sino-Soviet split in the 1960s. Those who sided with China and Albania in their criticism of the Soviet leadership, often added words like 'Revolutionary' or 'Marxist\u2013Leninist' to distinguish themselves from the pro-Soviet parties.\nMembership.\nIn 1985, approximately 38 percent of the world's population lived under \"communist\" governments (1.67billion out of 4.4billion). The CPSU's International Department officially recognized 95 ruling and nonruling communist parties. Overall, if one includes the 107 parties with significant memberships, there were approximately 82 million communist party members worldwide. Given its worldwide representation, the communist party may be counted as the principal challenger to the influence of liberal-democratic, catch-all parties in the twentieth century.\nFollowing the collapse of the Eastern Bloc between 1989\u20131992, most of these parties either disappeared or were renamed and adopted different goals than their predecessors. In the 21st century, only five ruling parties on the national level still described themselves as Marxist\u2013Leninist parties: the Chinese Communist Party, the Communist Party of Cuba, the Communist Party of Vietnam, the Workers' Party of Korea and the Lao People's Revolutionary Party. As of 2023, the Chinese Communist Party was the world's second largest political party, having over 99 million members.\nViews.\nAlthough the historical importance of communist parties is widely accepted, their activities and functions have been interpreted in different ways. One approach, sometimes known as the totalitarian school of communist studies, has implicitly treated all communist parties as the same types of organizations. Scholars such as Zbigniew Brzezinski and Francois Furet have relied upon conceptions of the party emphasizing centralized control, a top-down hierarchical structure, ideological rigidity, and strict party discipline. In contrast, other studies have emphasized the differences among communist parties. Multi-party studies, such as those by Robert C. Tucker and A. James McAdams, have emphasized the differences in both these parties' organizational structure and their use of Marxist and Leninist ideas to justify their policies.\nAnother important question is why communist parties were able to rule for as long as they did. Some scholars have depicted these parties as fatally flawed from their inception and argue they only remained in power because their leaders were willing to use their monopoly of power and the state monopoly to crush all forms of opposition. In contrast, other studies have emphasized these parties' ability to adapt their policies to changing times and circumstances.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "37010", "revid": "19469161", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37010", "title": "Philosophy of science", "text": "Branch of philosophy\nPhilosophy of science is the branch of philosophy concerned with the foundations, methods, and implications of science. Amongst its central questions are the difference between science and non-science, the reliability of scientific theories, and the ultimate purpose and meaning of science as a human endeavour. Philosophy of science focuses on metaphysical, epistemic and semantic aspects of scientific practice, and overlaps with metaphysics, ontology, logic, and epistemology, for example, when it explores the relationship between science and the concept of truth. Philosophy of science is both a theoretical and empirical discipline, relying on philosophical theorising as well as meta-studies of scientific practice. Ethical issues such as bioethics and scientific misconduct are often considered ethics or science studies rather than the philosophy of science.\nMany of the central problems concerned with the philosophy of science lack contemporary consensus, including whether science can infer truth about unobservable entities and whether inductive reasoning can be justified as yielding definite scientific knowledge. Philosophers of science also consider philosophical problems within particular sciences (such as biology, physics and social sciences such as economics and psychology). Some philosophers of science also use contemporary results in science to reach conclusions about philosophy itself.\nWhile philosophical thought pertaining to science dates back at least to the time of Aristotle, the general philosophy of science emerged as a distinct discipline only in the 20th century following the logical positivist movement, which aimed to formulate criteria for ensuring all philosophical statements' meaningfulness and objectively assessing them. Karl Popper criticized logical positivism and helped establish a modern set of standards for scientific methodology. Thomas Kuhn's 1962 book \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\" was also formative, challenging the view of scientific progress as the steady, cumulative acquisition of knowledge based on a fixed method of systematic experimentation and instead arguing that any progress is relative to a \"paradigm\", the set of questions, concepts, and practices that define a scientific discipline in a particular historical period.\nSubsequently, the coherentist approach to science, in which a theory is validated if it makes sense of observations as part of a coherent whole, became prominent due to W. V. Quine and others. Some thinkers such as Stephen Jay Gould seek to ground science in axiomatic assumptions, such as the uniformity of nature. A vocal minority of philosophers, and Paul Feyerabend in particular, argue against the existence of the \"scientific method\", so all approaches to science should be allowed, including explicitly supernatural ones. Another approach to thinking about science involves studying how knowledge is created from a sociological perspective, an approach represented by scholars like David Bloor and Barry Barnes. Finally, a tradition in continental philosophy approaches science from the perspective of a rigorous analysis of human experience.\nPhilosophies of the particular sciences range from questions about the nature of time raised by Einstein's general relativity, to the implications of economics for public policy. A central theme is whether the terms of one scientific theory can be intra- or intertheoretically reduced to the terms of another. Can chemistry be reduced to physics, or can sociology be reduced to individual psychology? The general questions of philosophy of science also arise with greater specificity in some particular sciences. For instance, the question of the validity of scientific reasoning is seen in a different guise in the foundations of statistics. The question of what counts as science and what should be excluded arises as a life-or-death matter in the philosophy of medicine. Additionally, the philosophies of biology, psychology, and the social sciences explore whether the scientific studies of human nature can achieve objectivity or are inevitably shaped by values and by social relations.\nIntroduction.\nDefining science.\nDistinguishing between science and non-science is referred to as the demarcation problem. For example, should psychoanalysis, creation science, and historical materialism be considered pseudosciences? Karl Popper called this the central question in the philosophy of science. However, no unified account of the problem has won acceptance among philosophers, and some regard the problem as unsolvable or uninteresting. Martin Gardner has argued for the use of a Potter Stewart standard (\"I know it when I see it\") for recognizing pseudoscience.\nEarly attempts by the logical positivists grounded science in observation while non-science was non-observational and hence meaningless. Popper argued that the central property of science is falsifiability. That is, every genuinely scientific claim is capable of being proven false, at least in principle.\nAn area of study or speculation that masquerades as science in an attempt to claim a legitimacy that it would not otherwise be able to achieve is referred to as pseudoscience, fringe science, or junk science. Physicist Richard Feynman coined the term \"cargo cult science\" for cases in which researchers believe they are doing science because their activities have the outward appearance of it but actually lack the \"kind of utter honesty\" that allows their results to be rigorously evaluated.\nScientific explanation.\nA closely related question is what counts as a good scientific explanation. In addition to providing predictions about future events, society often takes scientific theories to provide explanations for events that occur regularly or have already occurred. Philosophers have investigated the criteria by which a scientific theory can be said to have successfully explained a phenomenon, as well as what it means to say a scientific theory has explanatory power.\nOne early and influential account of scientific explanation is the deductive-nomological model. It says that a successful scientific explanation must deduce the occurrence of the phenomena in question from a scientific law. This view has been subjected to substantial criticism, resulting in several widely acknowledged counterexamples to the theory. It is especially challenging to characterize what is meant by an explanation when the thing to be explained cannot be deduced from any law because it is a matter of chance, or otherwise cannot be perfectly predicted from what is known. Wesley Salmon developed a model in which a good scientific explanation must be statistically relevant to the outcome to be explained. Others have argued that the key to a good explanation is unifying disparate phenomena or providing a causal mechanism.\nJustifying science.\nAlthough it is often taken for granted, it is not at all clear how one can infer the validity of a general statement from a number of specific instances or infer the truth of a theory from a series of successful tests. For example, a chicken observes that each morning the farmer comes and gives it food, for hundreds of days in a row. The chicken may therefore use inductive reasoning to infer that the farmer will bring food \"every\" morning. However, one morning, the farmer comes and kills the chicken. How is scientific reasoning more trustworthy than the chicken's reasoning?\nOne approach is to acknowledge that induction cannot achieve certainty, but observing more instances of a general statement can at least make the general statement more probable. So the chicken would be right to conclude from all those mornings that it is likely the farmer will come with food again the next morning, even if it cannot be certain. However, there remain difficult questions about the process of interpreting any given evidence into a probability that the general statement is true. One way out of these particular difficulties is to declare that all beliefs about scientific theories are subjective, or personal, and correct reasoning is merely about how evidence should change one's subjective beliefs over time.\nSome argue that what scientists do is not inductive reasoning at all but rather abductive reasoning, or inference to the best explanation. In this account, science is not about generalizing specific instances but rather about hypothesizing explanations for what is observed. As discussed in the previous section, it is not always clear what is meant by the \"best explanation\". Occam's razor, which counsels choosing the simplest available explanation, thus plays an important role in some versions of this approach. To return to the example of the chicken, would it be simpler to suppose that the farmer cares about it and will continue taking care of it indefinitely or that the farmer is fattening it up for slaughter? Philosophers have tried to make this heuristic principle more precise regarding theoretical parsimony or other measures. Yet, although various measures of simplicity have been brought forward as potential candidates, it is generally accepted that there is no such thing as a theory-independent measure of simplicity. In other words, there appear to be as many different measures of simplicity as there are theories themselves, and the task of choosing between measures of simplicity appears to be every bit as problematic as the job of choosing between theories. Nicholas Maxwell has argued for some decades that unity rather than simplicity is the key non-empirical factor in influencing the choice of theory in science, persistent preference for unified theories in effect committing science to the acceptance of a metaphysical thesis concerning unity in nature. In order to improve this problematic thesis, it needs to be represented in the form of a hierarchy of theses, each thesis becoming more insubstantial as one goes up the hierarchy.\nObservation inseparable from theory.\nWhen making observations, scientists look through telescopes, study images on electronic screens, record meter readings, and so on. Generally, on a basic level, they can agree on what they see, e.g., the thermometer shows 37.9 degrees C. But, if these scientists have different ideas about the theories that have been developed to explain these basic observations, they may disagree about what they are observing. For example, before Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, observers would have likely interpreted an image of the Einstein cross as five different objects in space. In light of that theory, however, astronomers will tell you that there are actually only two objects, one in the center and four different images of a second object around the sides. Alternatively, if other scientists suspect that something is wrong with the telescope and only one object is actually being observed, they are operating under yet another theory. Observations that cannot be separated from theoretical interpretation are said to be theory-laden.\nAll observation involves both perception and cognition. That is, one does not make an observation passively, but rather is actively engaged in distinguishing the phenomenon being observed from surrounding sensory data. Therefore, observations are affected by one's underlying understanding of the way in which the world functions, and that understanding may influence what is perceived, noticed, or deemed worthy of consideration. In this sense, it can be argued that all observation is theory-laden.\nThe purpose of science.\nShould science aim to determine ultimate truth, or are there questions that science cannot answer? \"Scientific realists\" claim that science aims at truth and that one ought to regard scientific theories as true, approximately true, or likely true. Conversely, \"scientific anti-realists\" argue that science does not aim (or at least does not succeed) at truth, especially truth about unobservables like electrons or other universes. Instrumentalists argue that scientific theories should only be evaluated on whether they are useful. In their view, whether theories are true or not is beside the point, because the purpose of science is to make predictions and enable effective technology.\nRealists often point to the success of recent scientific theories as evidence for the truth (or near truth) of current theories. Antirealists point to either the many false theories in the history of science, epistemic morals, the success of false modeling assumptions, or widely termed postmodern criticisms of objectivity as evidence against scientific realism. Antirealists attempt to explain the success of scientific theories without reference to truth. Some antirealists claim that scientific theories aim at being accurate only about observable objects and argue that their success is primarily judged by that criterion.\nReal patterns.\nThe notion of real patterns has been propounded, notably by philosopher Daniel C. Dennett, as an intermediate position between strong realism and eliminative materialism. This concept delves into the investigation of patterns observed in scientific phenomena to ascertain whether they signify underlying truths or are mere constructs of human interpretation. Dennett provides a unique ontological account concerning real patterns, examining the extent to which these recognized patterns have predictive utility and allow for efficient compression of information.\nThe discourse on real patterns extends beyond philosophical circles, finding relevance in various scientific domains. For example, in biology, inquiries into real patterns seek to elucidate the nature of biological explanations, exploring how recognized patterns contribute to a comprehensive understanding of biological phenomena. Similarly, in chemistry, debates around the reality of chemical bonds as real patterns continue.\nEvaluation of real patterns also holds significance in broader scientific inquiries. Researchers, like Tyler Millhouse, propose criteria for evaluating the realness of a pattern, particularly in the context of universal patterns and the human propensity to perceive patterns, even where there might be none. This evaluation is pivotal in advancing research in diverse fields, from climate change to machine learning, where recognition and validation of real patterns in scientific models play a crucial role.\nValues and science.\nValues intersect with science in different ways. There are epistemic values that mainly guide the scientific research. The scientific enterprise is embedded in particular culture and values through individual practitioners. Values emerge from science, both as product and process and can be distributed among several cultures in the society. When it comes to the justification of science in the sense of general public participation by single practitioners, science plays the role of a mediator between evaluating the standards and policies of society and its participating individuals, wherefore science indeed falls victim to vandalism and sabotage adapting the means to the end.\nIf it is unclear what counts as science, how the process of confirming theories works, and what the purpose of science is, there is considerable scope for values and other social influences to shape science. Indeed, values can play a role ranging from determining which research gets funded to influencing which theories achieve scientific consensus. For example, in the 19th century, cultural values held by scientists about race shaped research on evolution, and values concerning social class influenced debates on phrenology (considered scientific at the time). Feminist philosophers of science, sociologists of science, and others explore how social values affect science.\nHistory.\nPre-modern.\nThe origins of philosophy of science trace back to Plato and Aristotle, who distinguished the forms of approximate and exact reasoning, set out the threefold scheme of abductive, deductive, and inductive inference, and also analyzed reasoning by analogy. The eleventh century Arab polymath Ibn al-Haytham (known in Latin as Alhazen) conducted his research in optics by way of controlled experimental testing and applied geometry, especially in his investigations into the images resulting from the reflection and refraction of light. Roger Bacon (1214\u20131294), an English thinker and experimenter heavily influenced by al-Haytham, is recognized by many to be the father of modern scientific method. His view that mathematics was essential to a correct understanding of natural philosophy is considered to have been 400 years ahead of its time.\nModern.\nFrancis Bacon (no direct relation to Roger Bacon, who lived 300 years earlier) was a seminal figure in philosophy of science at the time of the Scientific Revolution. In his work \"Novum Organum\" (1620)\u2014an allusion to Aristotle's \"Organon\"\u2014Bacon outlined a new system of logic to improve upon the old philosophical process of syllogism. Bacon's method relied on experimental \"histories\" to eliminate alternative theories. In 1637, Ren\u00e9 Descartes established a new framework for grounding scientific knowledge in his treatise, \"Discourse on Method\", advocating the central role of reason as opposed to sensory experience. By contrast, in 1713, the 2nd edition of Isaac Newton's \"Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica\" argued that \"...\u00a0hypotheses\u00a0... have no place in experimental philosophy. In this philosophy[,] propositions are deduced from the phenomena and rendered general by induction.\" This passage influenced a \"later generation of philosophically-inclined readers to pronounce a ban on causal hypotheses in natural philosophy\". In particular, later in the 18th century, David Hume would famously articulate skepticism about the ability of science to determine causality and gave a definitive formulation of the problem of induction, though both theses would be contested by the end of the 18th century by Immanuel Kant in his Critique of Pure Reason and Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science. In 19th century Auguste Comte made a major contribution to the theory of science. The 19th century writings of John Stuart Mill are also considered important in the formation of current conceptions of the scientific method, as well as anticipating later accounts of scientific explanation.\nLogical positivism.\nInstrumentalism became popular among physicists around the turn of the 20th century, after which logical positivism defined the field for several decades. Logical positivism accepts only testable statements as meaningful, rejects metaphysical interpretations, and embraces verificationism (a set of theories of knowledge that combines logicism, empiricism, and linguistics to ground philosophy on a basis consistent with examples from the empirical sciences). Seeking to overhaul all of philosophy and convert it to a new \"scientific philosophy\", the Berlin Circle and the Vienna Circle propounded logical positivism in the late 1920s.\nInterpreting Ludwig Wittgenstein's early philosophy of language, logical positivists identified a verifiability principle or criterion of cognitive meaningfulness. From Bertrand Russell's logicism they sought reduction of mathematics to logic. They also embraced Russell's logical atomism, Ernst Mach's phenomenalism\u2014whereby the mind knows only actual or potential sensory experience, which is the content of all sciences, whether physics or psychology\u2014and Percy Bridgman's operationalism. Thereby, only the \"verifiable\" was scientific and \"cognitively meaningful\", whereas the unverifiable was unscientific, cognitively meaningless \"pseudostatements\"\u2014metaphysical, emotive, or such\u2014not worthy of further review by philosophers, who were newly tasked to organize knowledge rather than develop new knowledge.\nLogical positivism is commonly portrayed as taking the extreme position that scientific language should never refer to anything unobservable\u2014even the seemingly core notions of causality, mechanism, and principles\u2014but that is an exaggeration. Talk of such unobservables could be allowed as metaphorical\u2014direct observations viewed in the abstract\u2014or at worst metaphysical or emotional. \"Theoretical laws\" would be reduced to \"empirical laws\", while \"theoretical terms\" would garner meaning from \"observational terms\" via \"correspondence rules\". Mathematics in physics would reduce to symbolic logic via logicism, while rational reconstruction would convert ordinary language into standardized equivalents, all networked and united by a logical syntax. A scientific theory would be stated with its method of verification, whereby a logical calculus or empirical operation could verify its falsity or truth.\nIn the late 1930s, logical positivists fled Germany and Austria for Britain and America. By then, many had replaced Mach's phenomenalism with Otto Neurath's physicalism, and Rudolf Carnap had sought to replace \"verification\" with simply \"confirmation\". With World War II's close in 1945, logical positivism became milder, \"logical empiricism\", led largely by Carl Hempel, in America, who expounded the covering law model of scientific explanation as a way of identifying the logical form of explanations without any reference to the suspect notion of \"causation\". The logical positivist movement became a major underpinning of analytic philosophy, and dominated Anglosphere philosophy, including philosophy of science, while influencing sciences, into the 1960s. Yet the movement failed to resolve its central problems, and its doctrines were increasingly assaulted. Nevertheless, it brought about the establishment of philosophy of science as a distinct subdiscipline of philosophy, with Carl Hempel playing a key role.\nThomas Kuhn.\nIn the 1962 book \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\", Thomas Kuhn argued that the process of observation and evaluation takes place within a \"paradigm\", which he describes as \"universally recognized achievements that for a time provide model problems and solutions to community of practitioners.\" A paradigm implicitly identifies the objects and relations under study and suggests what experiments, observations or theoretical improvements need to be carried out to produce a useful result. He characterized normal science as the process of observation and \"puzzle solving\" which takes place within a paradigm, whereas revolutionary science occurs when one paradigm overtakes another in a paradigm shift.\nKuhn was a historian of science and his ideas were inspired by the study of older paradigms that have been discarded, such as Aristotelian mechanics or aether theory. These had often been portrayed by historians as using \"unscientific\" methods or beliefs. But Kuhn's examination showed that they were no less \"scientific\" than modern paradigms.\nA paradigm shift occurred when a significant number of observational anomalies arose in the old paradigm and efforts to resolve them within the paradigm were unsuccessful. A new paradigm was available that handled the anomalies with less difficulty and yet still covered (most of) the previous results. Over a period of time, often as long as a generation, more practitioners began working within the new paradigm and eventually the old paradigm was abandoned. For Kuhn, acceptance or rejection of a paradigm is a social process as much as a logical process.\nKuhn explicitly rejected a relativist interpretation of his ideas. He wrote \"terms like 'subjective' and 'intuitive' cannot be applied to [paradigms].\" Paradigms, as he understood them, are grounded in objective, observable evidence, but our use of them is psychological and our acceptance of them is social.\nCurrent approaches.\nCoherentism.\nIn contrast to the view that science rests on foundational assumptions, coherentism asserts that statements are justified by being a part of a coherent system. Or, rather, individual statements cannot be validated on their own: only coherent systems can be justified. A prediction of a transit of Venus is justified by its being coherent with broader beliefs about celestial mechanics and earlier observations. As explained above, observation is a cognitive act. That is, it relies on a pre-existing understanding, a systematic set of beliefs. An observation of a transit of Venus requires a huge range of auxiliary beliefs, such as those that describe the optics of telescopes, the mechanics of the telescope mount, and an understanding of celestial mechanics. If the prediction fails and a transit is not observed, that is likely to occasion an adjustment in the system, a change in some auxiliary assumption, rather than a rejection of the theoretical system.\nAccording to the Duhem\u2013Quine thesis, after Pierre Duhem and W.V. Quine, it is impossible to test a theory in isolation. One must always add auxiliary hypotheses in order to make testable predictions. For example, to test Newton's Law of Gravitation in the solar system, one needs information about the masses and positions of the Sun and all the planets. Famously, the failure to predict the orbit of Uranus in the 19th century led not to the rejection of Newton's Law but rather to the rejection of the hypothesis that the Solar System comprises only seven planets. The investigations that followed led to the discovery of an eighth planet, Neptune. If a test fails, something is wrong. But there is a problem in figuring out what that something is: a missing planet, badly calibrated test equipment, an unsuspected curvature of space, or something else.\nOne consequence of the Duhem\u2013Quine thesis is that one can make any theory compatible with any empirical observation by the addition of a sufficient number of suitable \"ad hoc\" hypotheses. Karl Popper accepted this thesis, leading him to reject na\u00efve falsification. Instead, he favored a \"survival of the fittest\" view in which the most falsifiable scientific theories are to be preferred.\nAnything goes methodology.\nPaul Feyerabend (1924\u20131994) argued that no description of scientific method could possibly be broad enough to include all the approaches and methods used by scientists, and that there are no useful and exception-free methodological rules governing the progress of science. He argued that \"the only principle that does not inhibit progress is: \"anything goes\"\".\nFeyerabend said that science started as a liberating movement, but that over time it had become increasingly dogmatic and rigid and had some oppressive features, and thus had become increasingly an ideology. Because of this, he said it was impossible to come up with an unambiguous way to distinguish science from religion, magic, or mythology. He saw the exclusive dominance of science as a means of directing society as authoritarian and ungrounded. Promulgation of this epistemological anarchism earned Feyerabend the title of \"the worst enemy of science\" from his detractors.\nSociology of scientific knowledge methodology.\nAccording to Kuhn, science is an inherently communal activity which can only be done as part of a community. For him, the fundamental difference between science and other disciplines is the way in which the communities function. Others, especially Feyerabend and some post-modernist thinkers, have argued that there is insufficient difference between social practices in science and other disciplines to maintain this distinction. For them, social factors play an important and direct role in scientific method, but they do not serve to differentiate science from other disciplines. On this account, science is socially constructed, though this does not necessarily imply the more radical notion that reality itself is a social construct.\nMichel Foucault sought to analyze and uncover how disciplines within the social sciences developed and adopted the methodologies used by their practitioners. In works like \"The Archaeology of Knowledge\", he used the term \"human sciences\". The human sciences do not comprise mainstream academic disciplines; they are rather an interdisciplinary space for the reflection on \"man\" who is the subject of more mainstream scientific knowledge, taken now as an object, sitting between these more conventional areas, and of course associating with disciplines such as anthropology, psychology, sociology, and even history. Rejecting the realist view of scientific inquiry, Foucault argued throughout his work that scientific discourse is not simply an objective study of phenomena, as both natural and social scientists like to believe, but is rather the product of systems of power relations struggling to construct scientific disciplines and knowledge within given societies. With the advances of scientific disciplines, such as psychology and anthropology, the need to separate, categorize, normalize and institutionalize populations into constructed social identities became a staple of the sciences. Constructions of what were considered \"normal\" and \"abnormal\" stigmatized and ostracized groups of people, like the mentally ill and sexual and gender minorities.\nHowever, some (such as Quine) do maintain that scientific reality is a social construct:\nPhysical objects are conceptually imported into the situation as convenient intermediaries not by definition in terms of experience, but simply as irreducible posits comparable, epistemologically, to the gods of Homer\u00a0... For my part I do, qua lay physicist, believe in physical objects and not in Homer's gods; and I consider it a scientific error to believe otherwise. But in point of epistemological footing, the physical objects and the gods differ only in degree and not in kind. Both sorts of entities enter our conceptions only as \"cultural posits\".\nThe public backlash of scientists against such views, particularly in the 1990s, became known as the science wars.\nA major development in recent decades has been the study of the formation, structure, and evolution of scientific communities by sociologists and anthropologists \u2013 including David Bloor, Harry Collins, Bruno Latour, Ian Hacking and Anselm Strauss. Concepts and methods (such as rational choice, social choice or game theory) from economics have also been applied for understanding the efficiency of scientific communities in the production of knowledge. This interdisciplinary field has come to be known as science and technology studies.\nHere the approach to the philosophy of science is to study how scientific communities actually operate.\nContinental philosophy.\nPhilosophers in the continental philosophical tradition are not traditionally categorized as philosophers of science. However, they have much to say about science, some of which has anticipated themes in the analytical tradition. For example, in \"The Genealogy of Morals\" (1887) Friedrich Nietzsche advanced the thesis that the motive for the search for truth in sciences is a kind of ascetic ideal.\nIn general, continental philosophy views science from a world-historical perspective. Philosophers such as Pierre Duhem (1861\u20131916) and Gaston Bachelard (1884\u20131962) wrote their works with this world-historical approach to science, predating Kuhn's 1962 work by a generation or more. All of these approaches involve a historical and sociological turn to science, with a priority on lived experience (a kind of Husserlian \"life-world\"), rather than a progress-based or anti-historical approach as emphasised in the analytic tradition. One can trace this continental strand of thought through the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl (1859\u20131938), the late works of Merleau-Ponty (\"Nature: Course Notes from the Coll\u00e8ge de France\", 1956\u20131960), and the hermeneutics of Martin Heidegger (1889\u20131976).\nThe largest effect on the continental tradition with respect to science came from Martin Heidegger's critique of the theoretical attitude in general, which of course includes the scientific attitude. For this reason, the continental tradition has remained much more skeptical of the importance of science in human life and in philosophical inquiry. Nonetheless, there have been a number of important works: especially those of a Kuhnian precursor, Alexandre Koyr\u00e9 (1892\u20131964). Another important development was that of Michel Foucault's analysis of historical and scientific thought in \"The Order of Things\" (1966) and his study of power and corruption within the \"science\" of madness. Post-Heideggerian authors contributing to continental philosophy of science in the second half of the 20th century include J\u00fcrgen Habermas (e.g., \"Truth and Justification\", 1998), Carl Friedrich von Weizs\u00e4cker (\"The Unity of Nature\", 1980; (1971)), and Wolfgang Stegm\u00fcller (\"Probleme und Resultate der Wissenschaftstheorie und Analytischen Philosophie\", 1973\u20131986).\nOther topics.\nReductionism.\nAnalysis involves breaking an observation or theory down into simpler concepts in order to understand it. Reductionism can refer to one of several philosophical positions related to this approach. One type of reductionism suggests that phenomena are amenable to scientific explanation at lower levels of analysis and inquiry. Perhaps a historical event might be explained in sociological and psychological terms, which in turn might be described in terms of human physiology, which in turn might be described in terms of chemistry and physics. Daniel Dennett distinguishes legitimate reductionism from what he calls \"greedy reductionism,\" which denies real complexities and leaps too quickly to sweeping generalizations.\nSocial accountability.\nA broad issue affecting the neutrality of science concerns the areas which science chooses to explore\u2014that is, what part of the world and of humankind are studied by science. Philip Kitcher in his \"Science, Truth, and Democracy\"\nargues that scientific studies that attempt to show one segment of the population as being less intelligent, less successful, or emotionally backward compared to others have a political feedback effect which further excludes such groups from access to science. Thus such studies undermine the broad consensus required for good science by excluding certain people, and so proving themselves in the end to be unscientific.\nPhilosophy of particular sciences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There is no such thing as philosophy-free science; there is only science whose philosophical baggage is taken on board without examination.\u2014\u200a\nIn addition to addressing the general questions regarding science and induction, many philosophers of science are occupied by investigating foundational problems in particular sciences. They also examine the implications of particular sciences for broader philosophical questions. The late 20th and early 21st century has seen a rise in the number of practitioners of philosophy of a particular science.\nPhilosophy of statistics.\nThe problem of induction discussed above is seen in another form in debates over the foundations of statistics. The standard approach to statistical hypothesis testing avoids claims about whether evidence supports a hypothesis or makes it more probable. Instead, the typical test yields a p-value, which is the probability of the \"evidence\" being such as it is, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. If the \"p\"-value is too high, the hypothesis is rejected, in a way analogous to falsification. In contrast, Bayesian inference seeks to assign probabilities to hypotheses. Related topics in philosophy of statistics include probability interpretations, overfitting, and the difference between correlation and causation.\nPhilosophy of mathematics.\nPhilosophy of mathematics is concerned with the philosophical foundations and implications of mathematics. The central questions are whether numbers, triangles, and other mathematical entities exist independently of the human mind and what is the nature of mathematical propositions. Is asking whether \"1 + 1 = 2\" is true fundamentally different from asking whether a ball is red? Was calculus invented or discovered? A related question is whether learning mathematics requires experience or reason alone. What does it mean to prove a mathematical theorem and how does one know whether a mathematical proof is correct? Philosophers of mathematics also aim to clarify the relationships between mathematics and logic, human capabilities such as intuition, and the material universe.\nPhilosophy of physics.\nPhilosophy of physics is the study of the fundamental, philosophical questions underlying modern physics, the study of matter and energy and how they interact. The main questions concern the nature of space and time, atoms and atomism. Also included are the predictions of cosmology, the interpretation of quantum mechanics, the foundations of statistical mechanics, causality, determinism, and the nature of physical laws. Classically, several of these questions were studied as part of metaphysics (for example, those about causality, determinism, and space and time).\nPhilosophy of chemistry.\nPhilosophy of chemistry is the philosophical study of the methodology and content of the science of chemistry. It is explored by philosophers, chemists, and philosopher-chemist teams. It includes research on general philosophy of science issues as applied to chemistry. For example, can all chemical phenomena be explained by quantum mechanics or is it not possible to reduce chemistry to physics? For another example, chemists have discussed the philosophy of how theories are confirmed in the context of confirming reaction mechanisms. Determining reaction mechanisms is difficult because they cannot be observed directly. Chemists can use a number of indirect measures as evidence to rule out certain mechanisms, but they are often unsure if the remaining mechanism is correct because there are many other possible mechanisms that they have not tested or even thought of. Philosophers have also sought to clarify the meaning of chemical concepts which do not refer to specific physical entities, such as chemical bonds.\nPhilosophy of astronomy.\nThe philosophy of astronomy seeks to understand and analyze the methodologies and technologies used by experts in the discipline, focusing on how observations made about space and astrophysical phenomena can be studied. Given that astronomers rely and use theories and formulas from other scientific disciplines, such as chemistry and physics, the pursuit of understanding how knowledge can be obtained about the cosmos, as well as the relation in which Earth and the Solar System have within personal views of humanity's place in the universe, philosophical insights into how facts about space can be scientifically analyzed and configure with other established knowledge is a main point of inquiry.\nPhilosophy of Earth sciences.\nThe philosophy of Earth science is concerned with how humans obtain and verify knowledge of the workings of the Earth system, including the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and geosphere (solid earth). Earth scientists' ways of knowing and habits of mind share important commonalities with other sciences, but also have distinctive attributes that emerge from the complex, heterogeneous, unique, long-lived, and non-manipulatable nature of the Earth system.\nPhilosophy of biology.\nPhilosophy of biology deals with epistemological, metaphysical, and ethical issues in the biological and biomedical sciences. Although philosophers of science and philosophers generally have long been interested in biology (e.g., Aristotle, Descartes, Leibniz and even Kant), philosophy of biology only emerged as an independent field of philosophy in the 1960s and 1970s. Philosophers of science began to pay increasing attention to developments in biology, from the rise of the modern synthesis in the 1930s and 1940s to the discovery of the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in 1953 to more recent advances in genetic engineering. Other key ideas such as the reduction of all life processes to biochemical reactions as well as the incorporation of psychology into a broader neuroscience are also addressed. Research in current philosophy of biology includes investigation of the foundations of evolutionary theory (such as Peter Godfrey-Smith's work), and the role of viruses as persistent symbionts in host genomes. As a consequence, the evolution of genetic content order is seen as the result of competent genome editors in contrast to former narratives in which error replication events (mutations) dominated.\nPhilosophy of medicine.\nBeyond medical ethics and bioethics, the philosophy of medicine is a branch of philosophy that includes the epistemology and ontology/metaphysics of medicine. Within the epistemology of medicine, evidence-based medicine (EBM) (or evidence-based practice (EBP)) has attracted attention, most notably the roles of randomisation, blinding and placebo controls. Related to these areas of investigation, ontologies of specific interest to the philosophy of medicine include Cartesian dualism, the monogenetic conception of disease and the conceptualization of 'placebos' and 'placebo effects'. There is also a growing interest in the metaphysics of medicine, particularly the idea of causation. Philosophers of medicine might not only be interested in how medical knowledge is generated, but also in the nature of such phenomena. Causation is of interest because the purpose of much medical research is to establish causal relationships, e.g. what causes disease, or what causes people to get better.\nPhilosophy of psychiatry.\nPhilosophy of psychiatry explores philosophical questions relating to psychiatry and mental illness. The philosopher of science and medicine Dominic Murphy identifies three areas of exploration in the philosophy of psychiatry. The first concerns the examination of psychiatry as a science, using the tools of the philosophy of science more broadly. The second entails the examination of the concepts employed in discussion of mental illness, including the experience of mental illness, and the normative questions it raises. The third area concerns the links and discontinuities between the philosophy of mind and psychopathology.\nPhilosophy of psychology.\nPhilosophy of psychology refers to issues at the theoretical foundations of modern psychology. Some of these issues are epistemological concerns about the methodology of psychological investigation. For example, is the best method for studying psychology to focus only on the response of behavior to external stimuli or should psychologists focus on mental perception and thought processes? If the latter, an important question is how the internal experiences of others can be measured. Self-reports of feelings and beliefs may not be reliable because, even in cases in which there is no apparent incentive for subjects to intentionally deceive in their answers, self-deception or selective memory may affect their responses. Then even in the case of accurate self-reports, how can responses be compared across individuals? Even if two individuals respond with the same answer on a Likert scale, they may be experiencing very different things.\nOther issues in philosophy of psychology are philosophical questions about the nature of mind, brain, and cognition, and are perhaps more commonly thought of as part of cognitive science, or philosophy of mind. For example, are humans rational creatures? Is there any sense in which they have free will, and how does that relate to the experience of making choices? Philosophy of psychology also closely monitors contemporary work conducted in cognitive neuroscience, psycholinguistics, and artificial intelligence, questioning what they can and cannot explain in psychology.\nPhilosophy of psychology is a relatively young field, because psychology only became a discipline of its own in the late 1800s. In particular, neurophilosophy has just recently become its own field with the works of Paul Churchland and Patricia Churchland. Philosophy of mind, by contrast, has been a well-established discipline since before psychology was a field of study at all. It is concerned with questions about the very nature of mind, the qualities of experience, and particular issues like the debate between dualism and monism.\nPhilosophy of social science.\nThe philosophy of social science is the study of the logic and method of the social sciences, such as sociology and cultural anthropology. Philosophers of social science are concerned with the differences and similarities between the social and the natural sciences, causal relationships between social phenomena, the possible existence of social laws, and the ontological significance of structure and agency.\nThe French philosopher, Auguste Comte (1798\u20131857), established the epistemological perspective of positivism in \"The Course in Positivist Philosophy\", a series of texts published between 1830 and 1842. The first three volumes of the \"Course\" dealt chiefly with the natural sciences already in existence (geoscience, astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology), whereas the latter two emphasised the inevitable coming of social science: \"sociologie\". For Comte, the natural sciences had to necessarily arrive first, before humanity could adequately channel its efforts into the most challenging and complex \"Queen science\" of human society itself. Comte offers an evolutionary system proposing that society undergoes three phases in its quest for the truth according to a general 'law of three stages'. These are (1) the \"theological\", (2) the \"metaphysical\", and (3) the \"positive\".\nComte's positivism established the initial philosophical foundations for formal sociology and social research. Durkheim, Marx, and Weber are more typically cited as the fathers of contemporary social science. In psychology, a positivistic approach has historically been favoured in behaviourism. Positivism has also been espoused by 'technocrats' who believe in the inevitability of social progress through science and technology.\nThe positivist perspective has been associated with 'scientism'; the view that the methods of the natural sciences may be applied to all areas of investigation, be it philosophical, social scientific, or otherwise. Among most social scientists and historians, orthodox positivism has long since lost popular support. Today, practitioners of both social and physical sciences instead take into account the distorting effect of observer bias and structural limitations. This scepticism has been facilitated by a general weakening of deductivist accounts of science by philosophers such as Thomas Kuhn, and new philosophical movements such as critical realism and neopragmatism. The philosopher-sociologist J\u00fcrgen Habermas has critiqued pure instrumental rationality as meaning that scientific-thinking becomes something akin to ideology itself.\nPhilosophy of technology.\nThe philosophy of technology is a sub-field of philosophy that studies the nature of technology. Specific research topics include study of the role of tacit and explicit knowledge in creating and using technology, the nature of functions in technological artifacts, the role of values in design, and ethics related to technology. Technology and engineering can both involve the application of scientific knowledge. The philosophy of engineering is an emerging sub-field of the broader philosophy of technology.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is venerated as a saint in the Catholic Church.\nOne of the great reforming popes, he initiated the Gregorian Reform, and is perhaps best known for the part he played in the Investiture Controversy, his dispute with Emperor Henry IV to establish the primacy of papal authority and the new canon law governing the election of the pope by the College of Cardinals. He was also at the forefront of developments in the relationship between the emperor and the papacy during the years before he became pope. He was the first pope to introduce a policy of obligatory celibacy for the clergy, which had until then commonly married, and also attacked the practice of simony.\nDuring the power struggles between the papacy and the Empire, Gregory excommunicated Henry IV three times, and Henry appointed Antipope Clement III to oppose him. Though Gregory was hailed as one of the greatest of the Roman pontiffs after his reforms proved successful, during his own reign he was denounced by some for his autocratic use of papal powers.\nIn later times, Gregory VII became an exemplar of papal supremacy to both supporters and opponents of the papacy. Beno of Santi Martino e Silvestro, who opposed Gregory VII in the Investiture Controversy, accused him of necromancy, cruelty, tyranny, and blasphemy. This was eagerly repeated by later opponents of the Catholic Church, such as the English Protestant John Foxe. In contrast, the modern historian and Anglican priest H. E. J. Cowdrey writes, \"[Gregory VII] was surprisingly flexible, feeling his way and therefore perplexing both rigorous collaborators ... and cautious and steady-minded ones ... His zeal, moral force, and religious conviction, however, ensured that he should retain to a remarkable degree the loyalty and service of a wide variety of men and women.\"\nEarly life.\nGregory was born Hildebrand () in the town of Sovana, in the County of Grosseto, now southern Tuscany, the son of a blacksmith. As a youth he was sent to study in Rome at the monastery of St. Mary on the Aventine, where his uncle was reportedly abbot of a monastery on the Aventine Hill. Among his masters were the erudite Lawrence, archbishop of Amalfi, and Johannes Gratianus, the future Pope Gregory VI. When the latter was deposed at the Council of Sutri in December of 1046, with approval of the Holy Roman Emperor Henry III and exiled to Germany, Hildebrand followed him to Cologne. According to some chroniclers, Hildebrand moved to Cluny after Gregory VI's death in 1048; though his declaration to have become a monk at Cluny is disputed.\nHe then accompanied Cluny's Abbot Bruno of Toul to Rome; there, Bruno was elected pope, choosing the name Leo IX, and named Hildebrand as deacon and papal administrator. In 1054 Leo sent Hildebrand as his legate to Tours in France in the wake of the controversy created by Berengar of Tours. At Leo's death, the new pope, Victor II, confirmed him as legate, while Victor's successor Stephen IX sent him and Anselm of Lucca to Germany to obtain recognition from Empress Agnes. Hildebrand succeeded in his plea to Agnes, but Stephen died before being able to return to Rome, and Hildebrand was soon embroiled the crisis caused by the Roman aristocracy's election of an antipope, Benedict X. With Agnes's continued support, Benedict was formally replaced by Nicholas II, and with the help of 300 Norman knights sent by Richard of Aversa, Hildebrand personally led the conquest of the castle of Galeria Antica where Benedict had taken refuge. Between 1058 and 1059, he was made archdeacon of the Roman church, becoming the most important figure in the papal administration.\nHe was again the most powerful figure behind the election of Anselm of Lucca the Elder as Pope Alexander II in the papal election of October 1061. The new pope put forward the reform program devised by Hildebrand and his followers. In his years as papal advisor, Hildebrand had an important role in the reconciliation with the Norman kingdom of southern Italy, in the anti-German alliance with the Pataria movement in northern Italy, and above all, in the new ecclesiastic law giving the cardinals exclusive rights to elect a new pope.\nElection to the papacy.\nPope Gregory VII was one of the few popes elected by acclamation. As funeral obsequies were being performed for Alexander II on 21 April 1073 in the Lateran Basilica, there arose an outcry from the clergy and people: \"Let Hildebrand be pope!\", \"Blessed Peter has chosen Hildebrand the Archdeacon!\" Hildebrand immediately fled and hid himself to make it clear that he refused this uncanonical election. He was finally found at the Church of San Pietro in Vincoli, to which a famous monastery was attached, and elected pope by the assembled cardinals, with the due consent of the Roman clergy, amid the repeated acclamations of the people.\nIt was debated, at the time and since, whether this extraordinary outburst in favour of Hildebrand by clergy and people was wholly spontaneous or premeditated. According to Benizo, Bishop of Sutri, a supporter of Hildebrand, the outcry was begun by Cardinal Ugo Candidus, Cardinal Priest of S. Clemente, who rushed into a pulpit and began to declaim to the people. Certainly, the mode of his election was highly criticized by his opponents. Many of the accusations against his election may have been expressions of personal dislike, as they were not raised until several years later. But it is clear from Gregory's own account of the circumstances in his Epistles 1 and 2 that it was conducted contrary to the Constitution of the Pope of 607, which forbade a papal election until the third day after a pope's burial. Cardinal Ugo's intervention was contrary to the Constitution of Nicholas II, which allowed only Cardinal Bishops to nominate candidates; and finally, it ignored the Constitution's requirement that the Holy Roman Emperor be consulted. However, Gregory was then confirmed by a second election at S. Pietro in Vincoli.\nGregory VII's earliest pontifical letters clearly acknowledged these events, and thus helped defuse doubts about his election and popularity. On 22 May 1073, the Feast of Pentecost, he received ordination as a priest, and he was consecrated a bishop and enthroned as pope on 29 June, the Feast of St. Peter's Chair.\nIn the decree of election, his electors proclaimed Gregory VII:\"a devout man, a man mighty in human and divine knowledge, a distinguished lover of equity and justice, a man firm in adversity and temperate in prosperity, a man, according to the saying of the Apostle, of good behavior, blameless, modest, sober, chaste, given to hospitality, and one that ruleth well his own house; a man from his childhood generously brought up in the bosom of this Mother Church, and for the merit of his life already raised to the archidiaconal dignity. [...] We choose then our Archdeacon Hildebrand to be pope and successor to the Apostle, and to bear henceforward and forever the name of Gregory\" (22 April 1073).Gregory VII's first attempts in foreign policy were towards a reconciliation with the Normans of Robert Guiscard; in the end the two parties did not meet. After a failed call for a crusade to the princes of northern Europe, and after obtaining the support of other Norman princes such as Landulf VI of Benevento and Richard I of Capua, Gregory VII was able to excommunicate Robert in 1074.\nIn the same year Gregory VII summoned a council in the Lateran palace, which condemned simony and confirmed celibacy for the Church's clergy. These decrees were further stressed, under threat of excommunication, the next year (24\u201328 February). In particular, Gregory decreed that only the Pope could appoint or depose bishops or move them from see to see, an act which was later to cause the Investiture Controversy.\nStart of conflict with the Emperor.\nGregory VII's main political project was his relationship with the Holy Roman Empire. After the death of Holy Roman Emperor Henry III, his untried son Henry IV had to contend with turbulent internal opposition to the German monarchy, presenting an opportunity for Gregory to strengthen the Church.\nIn the two years following Gregory's election, the Saxon rebellion fully occupied Henry and forced him to appease the pope at any cost. In May 1074 Henry did penance at Nuremberg\u2014in the presence of the papal legates\u2014to atone for his continued friendship with his councillors who had been banned by Gregory; he took an oath of obedience, and promised the pope his support in reforming the Church. However, as soon as Henry defeated the Saxons at the First Battle of Langensalza on 9 June 1075 (Battle of Homburg or Hohenburg), the young emperor tried to reassert his sovereign rights in northern Italy. Henry sent Count Eberhard to Lombardy to combat the Patarenes; nominated the cleric Tedald to the archbishopric of Milan, settling a prolonged and contentious question; and made overtures to the Norman duke Robert Guiscard.\nGregory VII replied with a harsh letter of 8 December 1075, accusing Henry of breaching his word and of continuing to support excommunicated councillors. The pope also sent a verbal message threatening to excommunicate and even depose the emperor. At the same time, Gregory was menaced by Cencio I Frangipane, who on Christmas night surprised him in church and kidnapped him, though he was released the following day.\nPope and emperor depose each other.\nThe high-handed demands and threats of the pope infuriated Henry and his court, and their answer was the hastily convened national synod of Worms on 24 January 1076. Gregory had many enemies among the German prelates, and the Roman cardinal Hugo Candidus, once on intimate terms with Gregory but now his opponent, hurried to Germany for the occasion. Candidus declaimed a list of accusations against the pope before the assembly, which resolved that Gregory had forfeited the papacy. In one document full of accusations, the bishops renounced their allegiance to Gregory. In another, Henry pronounced him deposed, and required the Romans to choose a new pope.\nThe council sent two bishops to Italy, who then procured a similar act of deposition from the Lombard bishops at the synod of Piacenza. Roland of Parma faced the pope with these decisions before the synod which had just assembled in the Lateran Basilica. Rejecting the threat, there soon arose such a storm of indignation that only the calming words of Gregory saved the envoy's life.\nOn the following day, 22 February 1076, Gregory solemnly pronounced a sentence of excommunication against Henry IV, divested him of his royal dignity, and absolved his subjects of their sworn allegiance. The effectiveness of this sentence depended entirely on Henry's subjects, above all on the German princes. Contemporary evidence suggests that the excommunication of Henry made a profound impression both in Germany and Italy.\nThirty years before, Henry III had deposed three unworthy claimants to the papacy, a service acknowledged by the Church and public opinion. When Henry IV again attempted this procedure he lacked support. In Germany there was a rapid and general feeling in favor of Gregory, strengthening the princes against their feudal lord Henry. When at Whitsun the emperor summoned a council of nobles to oppose the pope, only a few responded. Meanwhile, the Saxons seized the opportunity for a new rebellion, and the anti-royalist party grew in strength from month to month.\nWalk to Canossa.\nHenry now faced ruin. As a result of the agitation, which was zealously fostered by the papal legate Bishop Altmann of Passau, the princes met in October at Trebur to elect a new German emperor. Henry, who was stationed at Oppenheim on the left bank of the Rhine, was only saved from the loss of his throne by the failure of the assembled princes to agree on his successor. Nevertheless, they declared that Henry must make reparation and obeisance to Gregory, and if he were still under the ban on the anniversary of his excommunication, his throne should be considered vacant. At the same time they invited Gregory to Augsburg to decide the conflict.\nUnable to oppose his princes and the pope together, Henry saw that he must secure absolution from Gregory. At first he attempted this through an embassy, but when Gregory rejected his overtures he went to Italy in person. The pope had already left Rome and had informed the German princes that he would expect their escort on 8 January 1077 to Mantua. This escort had not appeared when he received the news of Henry's arrival at Canossa, where Gregory had taken refuge under the protection of his close ally, Matilda of Tuscany. Henry travelled through Burgundy ordering his troops to maintain civility, and was greeted with enthusiasm by the Lombards. In an astonishing turn, the emperor mortified his pride and knelt barefoot in the snow to beg the pope's forgiveness. This penance immediately reversed the moral situation, forcing Gregory to grant Henry absolution. The Walk to Canossa soon became legendary.\nThe reconciliation was only effected after prolonged negotiations and definite pledges on the part of Henry, and it was with reluctance that Gregory VII at length gave way, considering the political implications. If the pope granted absolution, the diet of princes in Augsburg, which had called on him as arbitrator, would be rendered impotent. It was impossible, however, to deny the penitent re-entrance into the Church, and Gregory VII's Christian duty overrode his political interests.\nThe removal of the ban did not imply a genuine settlement, as there was no mention of the main question between pope and emperor: that of investiture. A new conflict was inevitable.\nLater excommunications of Henry IV.\nThe rebellion of the German nobles did not end with the emperor's absolution from excommunication. To the contrary, at Forchheim in March 1077 they elected a rival ruler in the person of Duke Rudolf of Swabia, with the papal legates declaring their neutrality. Pope Gregory sought to maintain this neutrality during the following years, balancing the two parties of fairly equal strength, each trying to gain the upper hand by getting the pope on their side. His non-commitment exasperated both parties, but after Rudolf's victory at the Battle of Flarchheim on 27 January 1080, Gregory abandoned his waiting policy and again pronounced the excommunication and deposition of Henry on 7 March 1080. However, the pope, under pressure from the Saxons, was misinformed as to the significance of this battle.\nThe papal censure now got a very different reception from the one four years before. It was widely felt to be unjustly pronounced on frivolous grounds, and its authority came in question. The emperor, now more experienced, vigorously denounced the ban as illegal. He summoned a council at Brixen, and on 25 June 1080 thirty bishops present pronounced Gregory deposed, electing archbishop Guibert (Wibert) of Ravenna as his successor. Gregory countered on 15 October, ordering the clergy and laity to elect a new archbishop in place of the \"mad\" and \"tyrannical\" schismatic Wibert. In 1081, Henry opened the conflict against Gregory in Italy. The emperor was now in the stronger position, as thirteen cardinals had deserted the pope, and the rival emperor Rudolf of Swabia died on 16 October. A new imperial claimant, Hermann of Luxembourg, was put forward in August 1081, but he was unable to rally the papal party in Germany, and the power of Henry IV rose to its peak.\nThe pope's chief military supporter, Matilda of Tuscany, blocked Henry's armies from the western passages over the Apennines, so he had to approach Rome from Ravenna. Rome surrendered to the German king in 1084, and Gregory thereupon retired into the exile of the Castel Sant'Angelo. Gregory refused to entertain Henry's overtures, although the latter promised to hand over the anti-pope Guibert as a prisoner, if the sovereign pontiff would consent to crown Henry emperor. Gregory, however, insisted that Henry appear before a council and do penance. The emperor, while pretending to submit to these terms, tried hard to prevent the meeting of the council. A small number of bishops assembled nonetheless, and Gregory again excommunicated Henry.\nHenry, upon receipt of this news, again entered Rome on 21 March to see that his supporter, Archbishop Guibert of Ravenna, was enthroned as Pope Clement III on 24 March 1084, who in turn crowned Henry as emperor. In the meantime Gregory had formed an alliance with Robert Guiscard, who marched on the city and compelled Henry to flee towards Civita Castellana.\nExile from Rome.\nThe pope was liberated, but after the Roman people became incensed by the excesses of his Norman allies, he again withdrew to Monte Cassino, and later to the castle of Salerno by the sea, where he died on 25 May 1085, probably as a prisoner of the Normans. Three days before his death, he withdrew all the censures of excommunication that he had pronounced, except those against the two chief offenders\u2014Henry and Guibert.\nPapal policy to the rest of Europe.\nEngland.\nIn 1076, Gregory appointed Dol Euen, a monk of Saint-Melaine of Rennes, as bishop of Dol, rejecting both the incumbent, Iuthael, who had the support of William the Conqueror, who had recently been conducting military operations in north-eastern Brittany, and Gilduin, the candidate of the nobles in Dol opposing William. Gregory rejected Iuthael because he was notorious for simony and Guilden as too young. Gregory also bestowed on Dol Euen the pallium of a metropolitan archbishop, on the condition that he would submit to the judgment of the Holy See when the long-standing case of the right of Dol to be a metropolitan and use the pallium was finally decided.\nKing William felt himself so safe that he interfered autocratically with the management of the church, forbade the bishops to visit Rome, made appointments to bishoprics and abbeys, and showed little anxiety when the pope lectured him on the different principles which he had as to the relationship of spiritual and temporal powers, or when he prohibited him from commerce or commanded him to acknowledge himself a vassal of the apostolic chair. William was particularly annoyed at Gregory's insistence on dividing ecclesiastical England into two provinces, in opposition to William's need to emphasize the unity of his newly acquired kingdom. Gregory's increasing insistence on church independence from secular authority in the matter of clerical appointments became a more and more contentious issue. He sought as well to compel the episcopacy to look to Rome for validation and direction, demanding the regular attendance of prelates in Rome. Gregory had no power to compel the English king to an alteration in his ecclesiastical policy, so he was compelled to ignore what he could not approve, and even considered it advisable to assure King William of his particular affection. On the whole, William's policy was of great benefit to the Church.\nNormans in the Kingdom of Sicily.\nThe relationship of Gregory VII to other European states was strongly influenced by his German policy, since the Holy Roman Empire, by taking up most of his energies, often forced him to show to other rulers the very moderation which he withheld from the German king. The attitude of the Normans brought him a rude awakening. The great concessions made to them under Nicholas II were not only powerless to stem their advance into central Italy, but failed to secure even the expected protection for the papacy. When Gregory VII was hard pressed by Henry IV, Robert Guiscard left him to his fate, and only intervened when he himself was threatened with German arms. Then, on the capture of Rome, he abandoned the city to his troops, and the popular indignation evoked by his act brought about Gregory's exile.\nClaims of Papal sovereignty.\nIn the case of several countries, Gregory VII tried to establish a claim of sovereignty on the part of the Papacy, and to secure the recognition of its self-asserted rights of possession. On the ground of \"immemorial usage\", Corsica and Sardinia were assumed to belong to the Roman Church. Spain, Hungary and Croatia were also claimed as her property, and an attempt was made to induce the king of Denmark to hold his realm as a fief from the pope.\nIn his treatment of ecclesiastical policy and ecclesiastical reform, Gregory did not stand alone, but found powerful support: in England Archbishop Lanfranc of Canterbury stood closest to him; in France his champion was Bishop Hugh de Di\u00e9, who afterwards became Archbishop of Lyon.\nFrance.\nPhilip I of France, by his practice of simony and the violence of his proceedings against the Church, provoked a threat of summary measures. Excommunication, deposition and the interdict appeared to be imminent in 1074. Gregory, however, refrained from translating his threats into actions, although the attitude of the king showed no change, for he wished to avoid a dispersion of his strength in the conflict soon to break out in Germany.\nPope Gregory attempted to organize a crusade into Al-Andalus, led by Count Ebles II of Roucy.\nDistant Christian countries.\nGregory, in fact, established some sort of relations with every country in Christendom; though these relations did not invariably realize the ecclesiastico-political hopes connected with them. His correspondence extended to Poland, Kievan Rus' and Bohemia. He unsuccessfully tried to bring Armenia into closer contact with Rome.\nByzantine Empire.\nGregory was particularly concerned with the East. The schism between Rome and the Byzantine Empire was a severe blow to him, and he worked hard to restore the former amicable relationship. Gregory successfully tried to get in touch with the emperor Michael VII. When the news of the Muslim attacks on the Christians in the East filtered through to Rome, and the political embarrassments of the Byzantine emperor increased, he conceived the project of a great military expedition and exhorted the faithful to participate in recovering the Church of the Holy Sepulchre\u2014foreshadowing the First Crusade. In his efforts to recruit for the expedition, he emphasized the suffering of eastern Christians, arguing western Christians had a moral obligation to go to their aid.\nInternal policy and reforms.\nHis lifework was based on his conviction that the Church was founded by God and entrusted with the task of embracing all mankind in a single society in which divine will is the basis of all law; that, in its capacity as a divine institution, it is supreme over all human structures, especially the secular state; and that the pope, in his role as head of the Church, is the vice-regent of God on earth, so that disobedience to him implies disobedience to God and a defection from Christianity. However, a political realization of this ideal would have required the abolition of all secular monarchs and authorities.\nThus Gregory VII, as a practical politician, acknowledged the existence of the state as a dispensation of providence, admitted the coexistence of church and state as a divine ordinance, and emphasized the necessity of union between the \"sacerdotium\" and the \"imperium\". But he absolutely refused to put the two powers on an equal footing; the superiority of church to state admitted of no doubt or discussion. He wished to see all important matters of dispute referred to Rome, ultimately to the pope himself, with a corresponding curtailment of the powers of bishops. Since these clung to their traditional episcopal independence, his papacy is full of struggles against the higher clergy. \nThis battle for the foundation of papal supremacy is connected with his championship of compulsory celibacy among the clergy and his attack on simony. Gregory VII did not introduce the celibacy of the priesthood into the Church, but he took up the struggle with greater energy than his predecessors. In 1074, he published an encyclical, absolving the people from their obedience to bishops who allowed married priests. The next year he enjoined them to take action against married priests, and deprived these clerics of their revenues. Both the campaign against priestly marriage and that against simony provoked widespread resistance.\nHis writings treat mainly of the principles and practice of Church government. They may be found in Mansi's collection under the title \"Gregorii VII registri sive epistolarum libri\". Most of his surviving letters are preserved in his Register, which is now stored in the Vatican Archives.\nGregory VII's reforms to curb lay control of the Catholic Church have been characterized as a key factor in the rise of urban self-government in Europe.\nGregory VII was critical in the birth of modern universities, as his 1079 decree ordered the regulated establishment of the cathedral schools which transformed into the first European universities.\nDoctrine of the Eucharist.\nGregory VII was seen by Pope Paul VI as instrumental in affirming the dogma of Christ's real presence in the Blessed Sacrament. Gregory's confession of this belief, imposed on Berengarius, was quoted in Pope Paul VI's 1965 encyclical \"Mysterium fidei\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I believe in my heart and openly profess that the bread and wine that are placed on the altar are, through the mystery of the sacred prayer and the words of the Redeemer, substantially changed into the true and proper and lifegiving flesh and blood of Jesus Christ our Lord, and that after the consecration they are the true body of Christ.\nThis profession of faith began a \"Eucharistic Renaissance\" in the churches of Europe beginning in the 12th century.\nDeath.\nPope Gregory VII died in exile in Salerno; the epitaph on his sarcophagus in the city's Cathedral says: \"I have loved justice and hated iniquity; therefore, I die in exile.\"\nLegacy.\nGregory VII was beatified by Pope Gregory XIII in 1584 and canonized on 24 May 1728 by Pope Benedict XIII.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Thus it can be represented heuristically as\nformula_1\nsuch that\nformula_2\nSince there is no function having this property, modelling the delta \"function\" rigorously involves the use of limits or, as is common in mathematics, measure theory and the theory of distributions.\nThe delta function was introduced by physicist Paul Dirac, and has since been applied routinely in physics and engineering to model point masses and instantaneous impulses. It is called the delta function because it is a continuous analogue of the Kronecker delta function, which is usually defined on a discrete domain and takes values 0 and 1. The mathematical rigor of the delta function was disputed until Laurent Schwartz developed the theory of distributions, where it is defined as a linear form acting on functions.\nMotivation and overview.\nThe graph of the Dirac delta is usually thought of as following the whole \"x\"-axis and the positive \"y\"-axis. The Dirac delta is used to model a tall narrow spike function (an \"impulse\"), and other similar abstractions such as a point charge or point mass. For example, to calculate the dynamics of a billiard ball being struck, one can approximate the force of the impact by a Dirac delta. In doing so, one can simplify the equations and calculate the motion of the ball by only considering the total impulse of the collision, without a detailed model of all of the elastic energy transfer at subatomic levels (for instance).\nTo be specific, suppose that a billiard ball is at rest. At time formula_3 it is struck by another ball, imparting it with a momentum P, with units kg\u22c5m\u22c5s\u22121. The exchange of momentum is not actually instantaneous, being mediated by elastic processes at the molecular and subatomic level, but for practical purposes it is convenient to consider that energy transfer as effectively instantaneous. The force therefore is \"P\" \"\u03b4\"(\"t\"); the units of \"\u03b4\"(\"t\") are s\u22121.\nTo model this situation more rigorously, suppose that the force instead is uniformly distributed over a small time interval That is,\nformula_4\nThen the momentum at any time t is found by integration:\nformula_5\nNow, the model situation of an instantaneous transfer of momentum requires taking the limit as \u0394\"t\" \u2192 0, giving a result everywhere except at 0:\nformula_6\nHere the functions formula_7 are thought of as useful approximations to the idea of instantaneous transfer of momentum.\nThe delta function allows us to construct an idealized limit of these approximations. Unfortunately, the actual limit of the functions (in the sense of pointwise convergence) formula_8 is zero everywhere but a single point, where it is infinite. To make proper sense of the Dirac delta, we should instead insist that the property\nformula_9\nwhich holds for all formula_10, should continue to hold in the limit. So, in the equation it is understood that the limit is always taken outside the integral.\nIn applied mathematics, as we have done here, the delta function is often manipulated as a kind of limit (a weak limit) of a sequence of functions, each member of which has a tall spike at the origin: for example, a sequence of Gaussian distributions centered at the origin with variance tending to zero. (However, even in some applications, highly oscillatory functions are used as approximations to the delta function, see below.)\nThe Dirac delta, given the desired properties outlined above, cannot be a function with domain and range in real numbers. For example, the objects \"f\"(\"x\") = \"\u03b4\"(\"x\") and \"g\"(\"x\") = 0 are equal everywhere except at \"x\" = 0 yet have integrals that are different. According to Lebesgue integration theory, if f and g are functions such that \"f\" = \"g\" almost everywhere, then f is integrable if and only if g is integrable and the integrals of f and g are identical. A rigorous approach to regarding the Dirac delta function as a mathematical object in its own right uses measure theory or the theory of distributions.\nHistory.\nIn physics, the Dirac delta function was popularized by Paul Dirac in this book \"The Principles of Quantum Mechanics\" published in 1930. However, Oliver Heaviside, 35 years before Dirac, described an impulsive function called the Heaviside step function for purposes and with properties analogous to Dirac's work. Even earlier several mathematicians and physicists used limits of sharply peaked functions in derivations.\nAn infinitesimal formula for an infinitely tall, unit impulse delta function (infinitesimal version of Cauchy distribution) explicitly appears in an 1827 text of Augustin-Louis Cauchy. Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson considered the issue in connection with the study of wave propagation as did Gustav Kirchhoff somewhat later. Kirchhoff and Hermann von Helmholtz also introduced the unit impulse as a limit of Gaussians, which also corresponded to Lord Kelvin's notion of a point heat source. The Dirac delta function as such was introduced by Paul Dirac in his 1927 paper \"The Physical Interpretation of the Quantum Dynamics.\" He called it the \"delta function\" since he used it as a continuum analogue of the discrete Kronecker delta.\nMathematicians refer to the same concept as a distribution rather than a function.\nJoseph Fourier presented what is now called the Fourier integral theorem in his treatise \"Th\u00e9orie analytique de la chaleur\" in the form:\nformula_11\nwhich is tantamount to the introduction of the \u03b4-function in the form:\nformula_12\nLater, Augustin Cauchy expressed the theorem using exponentials:\nformula_13\nCauchy pointed out that in some circumstances the \"order\" of integration is significant in this result (contrast Fubini's theorem).\nAs justified using the theory of distributions, the Cauchy equation can be rearranged to resemble Fourier's original formulation and expose the \"\u03b4\"-function as\nformula_14\nwhere the \"\u03b4\"-function is expressed as\nformula_15\nA rigorous interpretation of the exponential form and the various limitations upon the function \"f\" necessary for its application extended over several centuries. The problems with a classical interpretation are explained as follows:\n The greatest drawback of the classical Fourier transformation is a rather narrow class of functions (originals) for which it can be effectively computed. Namely, it is necessary that these functions decrease sufficiently rapidly to zero (in the neighborhood of infinity) to ensure the existence of the Fourier integral. For example, the Fourier transform of such simple functions as polynomials does not exist in the classical sense. The extension of the classical Fourier transformation to distributions considerably enlarged the class of functions that could be transformed and this removed many obstacles.\nFurther developments included generalization of the Fourier integral, \"beginning with Plancherel's pathbreaking \"L\"2-theory (1910), continuing with Wiener's and Bochner's works (around 1930) and culminating with the amalgamation into L. Schwartz's theory of distributions (1945)\u00a0...\", and leading to the formal development of the Dirac delta function.\nDefinitions.\nThe Dirac delta function formula_16 can be loosely thought of as a function on the real line which is zero everywhere except at the origin, where it is infinite,\nformula_17\nand which is also constrained to satisfy the identity\nformula_18\nThis is merely a heuristic characterization. The Dirac delta is not a function in the traditional sense as no extended real number valued function defined on the real numbers has these properties.\nAs a measure.\nOne way to rigorously capture the notion of the Dirac delta function is to define a measure, called Dirac measure, which accepts a subset A of the real line R as an argument, and returns \"\u03b4\"(\"A\") = 1 if 0 \u2208 \"A\", and \"\u03b4\"(\"A\") = 0 otherwise. If the delta function is conceptualized as modeling an idealized point mass at 0, then \"\u03b4\"(\"A\") represents the mass contained in the set A. One may then define the integral against \u03b4 as the integral of a function against this mass distribution. Formally, the Lebesgue integral provides the necessary analytic device. The Lebesgue integral with respect to the measure \u03b4 satisfies\nformula_19\nfor all continuous compactly supported functions f. The measure \u03b4 is not absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure\u2014in fact, it is a singular measure. Consequently, the delta measure has no Radon\u2013Nikodym derivative (with respect to Lebesgue measure)\u2014no true function for which the property\nformula_20\nholds. As a result, the latter notation is a convenient abuse of notation, and not a standard (Riemann or Lebesgue) integral.\nAs a probability measure on R, the delta measure is characterized by its cumulative distribution function, which is the unit step function.\nformula_21\nThis means that \"H\"(\"x\") is the integral of the cumulative indicator function 1(\u2212\u221e, \"x\"] with respect to the measure \u03b4; to wit,\nformula_22\nthe latter being the measure of this interval. Thus in particular the integration of the delta function against a continuous function can be properly understood as a Riemann\u2013Stieltjes integral:\nformula_23\nAll higher moments of \u03b4 are zero. In particular, characteristic function and moment generating function are both equal to one.\nAs a distribution.\nIn the theory of distributions, a generalized function is considered not a function in itself but only through how it affects other functions when \"integrated\" against them. In keeping with this philosophy, to define the delta function properly, it is enough to say what the \"integral\" of the delta function is against a sufficiently \"good\" test function \u03c6. If the delta function is already understood as a measure, then the Lebesgue integral of a test function against that measure supplies the necessary integral.\nA typical space of test functions consists of all smooth functions on R with compact support that have as many derivatives as required. As a distribution, the Dirac delta is a linear functional on the space of test functions and is defined by\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nfor every test function \u03c6.\nFor \u03b4 to be properly a distribution, it must be continuous in a suitable topology on the space of test functions. In general, for a linear functional S on the space of test functions to define a distribution, it is necessary and sufficient that, for every positive integer N there is an integer \"M\"\"N\" and a constant \"C\"\"N\" such that for every test function \u03c6, one has the inequality\nformula_24\nwhere sup represents the supremum. With the \u03b4 distribution, one has such an inequality (with \"C\"\"N\" = 1) with \"M\"\"N\" = 0 for all N. Thus \u03b4 is a distribution of order zero. It is, furthermore, a distribution with compact support (the support being {0}).\nThe delta distribution can also be defined in several equivalent ways. For instance, it is the distributional derivative of the Heaviside step function. This means that for every test function \u03c6, one has\nformula_25\nIntuitively, if integration by parts were permitted, then the latter integral should simplify to\nformula_26\nand indeed, a form of integration by parts is permitted for the Stieltjes integral, and in that case, one does have\nformula_27\nGenerally, when the term \"Dirac delta function\" is used, it is in the sense of distributions rather than measures, the Dirac measure being among several terms for the corresponding notion in measure theory. Some sources may also use the term \"Dirac delta distribution\".\nGeneralizations.\nThe delta function can be defined in n-dimensional Euclidean space R\"n\" as the measure such that\nformula_28\nfor every compactly supported continuous function f. As a measure, the n-dimensional delta function is the product measure of the 1-dimensional delta functions in each variable separately. Thus, formally, with x = (\"x\"1, \"x\"2, ..., \"x\"\"n\"), one has\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe delta function can also be defined in the sense of distributions exactly as above in the one-dimensional case. However, despite widespread use in engineering contexts, (2) should be manipulated with care, since the product of distributions can only be defined under quite narrow circumstances.\nThe notion of a Dirac measure makes sense on any set. Thus if X is a set, \"x\"0 \u2208 \"X\" is a marked point, and \u03a3 is any sigma algebra of subsets of X, then the measure defined on sets \"A\" \u2208 \u03a3 by\nformula_29\nis the delta measure or unit mass concentrated at \"x\"0.\nAnother common generalization of the delta function is to a differentiable manifold where most of its properties as a distribution can also be exploited because of the differentiable structure. The delta function on a manifold M centered at the point \"x\"0 \u2208 \"M\" is defined as the following distribution:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nfor all compactly supported smooth real-valued functions \u03c6 on M. A common special case of this construction is a case in which M is an open set in the Euclidean space R\"n\".\nOn a locally compact Hausdorff space X, the Dirac delta measure concentrated at a point x is the Radon measure associated with the Daniell integral (3) on compactly supported continuous functions \u03c6. At this level of generality, calculus as such is no longer possible, however a variety of techniques from abstract analysis are available. For instance, the mapping formula_30 is a continuous embedding of X into the space of finite Radon measures on X, equipped with its vague topology. Moreover, the convex hull of the image of X under this embedding is dense in the space of probability measures on X.\nProperties.\nScaling and symmetry.\nThe delta function satisfies the following scaling property for a non-zero scalar \u03b1:\nformula_31\nThen \u03b4 is obtained by applying a power of the Laplacian to the integral with respect to the unit sphere measure d\u03c9 of \"g\"(\"x\" \u00b7 \"\u03be\") for \u03be in the unit sphere \"S\"\"n\"\u22121:\nformula_32\nThe Laplacian here is interpreted as a weak derivative, so that this equation is taken to mean that, for any test function \u03c6,\nformula_33\nThe result follows from the formula for the Newtonian potential (the fundamental solution of Poisson's equation). This is essentially a form of the inversion formula for the Radon transform because it recovers the value of \"\u03c6\"(\"x\") from its integrals over hyperplanes. For instance, if n is odd and \"k\" = 1, then the integral on the right hand side is\nformula_34\nwhere \"R\u03c6\"(\"\u03be\", \"p\") is the Radon transform of \u03c6:\nformula_35\nAn alternative equivalent expression of the plane wave decomposition is:\nformula_36\nFourier transform.\nThe delta function is a tempered distribution, and therefore it has a well-defined Fourier transform. Formally, one finds\nformula_37\nProperly speaking, the Fourier transform of a distribution is defined by imposing self-adjointness of the Fourier transform under the duality pairing formula_38 of tempered distributions with Schwartz functions. Thus formula_39 is defined as the unique tempered distribution satisfying\nformula_40\nfor all Schwartz functions \u03c6. And indeed it follows from this that formula_41\nAs a result of this identity, the convolution of the delta function with any other tempered distribution S is simply S:\nformula_42\nThat is to say that \u03b4 is an identity element for the convolution on tempered distributions, and in fact, the space of compactly supported distributions under convolution is an associative algebra with identity the delta function. This property is fundamental in signal processing, as convolution with a tempered distribution is a linear time-invariant system, and applying the linear time-invariant system measures its impulse response. The impulse response can be computed to any desired degree of accuracy by choosing a suitable approximation for \u03b4, and once it is known, it characterizes the system completely. See .\nThe inverse Fourier transform of the tempered distribution \"f\"(\"\u03be\") = 1 is the delta function. Formally, this is expressed as\nformula_43\nand more rigorously, it follows since\nformula_44\nfor all Schwartz functions \"f\".\nIn these terms, the delta function provides a suggestive statement of the orthogonality property of the Fourier kernel on R. Formally, one has\nformula_45\nThis is, of course, shorthand for the assertion that the Fourier transform of the tempered distribution\nformula_46\nis\nformula_47\nwhich again follows by imposing self-adjointness of the Fourier transform.\nBy analytic continuation of the Fourier transform, the Laplace transform of the delta function is found to be\nformula_48\nFourier kernels.\nIn the study of Fourier series, a major question consists of determining whether and in what sense the Fourier series associated with a periodic function converges to the function. The n-th partial sum of the Fourier series of a function f of period 2\u03c0 is defined by convolution (on the interval [\u2212\u03c0,\u03c0]) with the Dirichlet kernel:\nformula_49\nThus,\nformula_50\nwhere\nformula_51\nA fundamental result of elementary Fourier series states that the Dirichlet kernel restricted to the interval\u00a0[\u2212\u03c0,\u03c0] tends to a multiple of the delta function as \"N\" \u2192 \u221e. This is interpreted in the distribution sense, that\nformula_52\nfor every compactly supported smooth function f. Thus, formally one has\nformula_53\non the interval [\u2212\u03c0,\u03c0].\nDespite this, the result does not hold for all compactly supported continuous functions: that is \"DN\" does not converge weakly in the sense of measures. The lack of convergence of the Fourier series has led to the introduction of a variety of summability methods to produce convergence. The method of Ces\u00e0ro summation leads to the Fej\u00e9r kernel\nformula_54\nThe Fej\u00e9r kernels tend to the delta function in a stronger sense that\nformula_55\nfor every compactly supported continuous function f. The implication is that the Fourier series of any continuous function is Ces\u00e0ro summable to the value of the function at every point.\nHilbert space theory.\nThe Dirac delta distribution is a densely defined unbounded linear functional on the Hilbert space L2 of square-integrable functions. Indeed, smooth compactly supported functions are dense in \"L\"2, and the action of the delta distribution on such functions is well-defined. In many applications, it is possible to identify subspaces of \"L\"2 and to give a stronger topology on which the delta function defines a bounded linear functional.\nSobolev spaces.\nThe Sobolev embedding theorem for Sobolev spaces on the real line R implies that any square-integrable function f such that\nformula_56\nis automatically continuous, and satisfies in particular\nformula_57\nThus \u03b4 is a bounded linear functional on the Sobolev space \"H\"1. Equivalently \u03b4 is an element of the continuous dual space \"H\"\u22121 of \"H\"1. More generally, in n dimensions, one has \"\u03b4\" \u2208 \"H\"\u2212\"s\"(R\"n\") provided \"s\" &gt;.\nSpaces of holomorphic functions.\nIn complex analysis, the delta function enters via Cauchy's integral formula, which asserts that if D is a domain in the complex plane with smooth boundary, then\nformula_58\nfor all holomorphic functions f in D that are continuous on the closure of D. As a result, the delta function \"\u03b4\"\"z\" is represented in this class of holomorphic functions by the Cauchy integral:\nformula_59\nMoreover, let \"H\"2(\u2202\"D\") be the Hardy space consisting of the closure in \"L\"2(\u2202\"D\") of all holomorphic functions in D continuous up to the boundary of D. Then functions in \"H\"2(\u2202\"D\") uniquely extend to holomorphic functions in D, and the Cauchy integral formula continues to hold. In particular for \"z\" \u2208 \"D\", the delta function \u03b4z is a continuous linear functional on \"H\"2(\u2202\"D\"). This is a special case of the situation in several complex variables in which, for smooth domains D, the Szeg\u0151 kernel plays the role of the Cauchy integral.\nAnother representation of the delta function in a space of holomorphic functions is on the space formula_60 of square-integrable holomorphic functions in an open set formula_61. This is a closed subspace of formula_62, and therefore is a Hilbert space. On the other hand, the functional that evaluates a holomorphic function in formula_60 at a point formula_64 of formula_65 is a continuous functional, and so by the Riesz representation theorem, is represented by integration against a kernel formula_66, the Bergman kernel. This kernel is the analog of the delta function in this Hilbert space. A Hilbert space having such a kernel is called a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. In the special case of the unit disc, one has\nformula_67\nResolutions of the identity.\nGiven a complete orthonormal basis set of functions {\"\u03c6\"\"n\"} in a separable Hilbert space, for example, the normalized eigenvectors of a compact self-adjoint operator, any vector f can be expressed as\nformula_68\nThe coefficients {\u03b1n} are found as\nformula_69\nwhich may be represented by the notation:\nformula_70\na form of the bra\u2013ket notation of Dirac. Adopting this notation, the expansion of f takes the dyadic form:\nformula_71\nLetting I denote the identity operator on the Hilbert space, the expression\nformula_72\nis called a resolution of the identity. When the Hilbert space is the space \"L\"2(\"D\") of square-integrable functions on a domain D, the quantity:\nformula_73\nis an integral operator, and the expression for f can be rewritten\nformula_74\nThe right-hand side converges to f in the \"L\"2 sense. It need not hold in a pointwise sense, even when f is a continuous function. Nevertheless, it is common to abuse notation and write\nformula_75\nresulting in the representation of the delta function:\nformula_76\nWith a suitable rigged Hilbert space (\u03a6, \"L\"2(\"D\"), \u03a6*) where \u03a6 \u2282 \"L\"2(\"D\") contains all compactly supported smooth functions, this summation may converge in \u03a6*, depending on the properties of the basis \"\u03c6\"\"n\". In most cases of practical interest, the orthonormal basis comes from an integral or differential operator (e.g. the heat kernel), in which case the series converges in the distribution sense.\nInfinitesimal delta functions.\nCauchy used an infinitesimal \u03b1 to write down a unit impulse, infinitely tall and narrow Dirac-type delta function \u03b4\u03b1 satisfying formula_77 in a number of articles in 1827. Cauchy defined an infinitesimal in \"Cours d'Analyse\" (1827) in terms of a sequence tending to zero. Namely, such a null sequence becomes an infinitesimal in Cauchy's and Lazare Carnot's terminology.\nNon-standard analysis allows one to rigorously treat infinitesimals. The article by contains a bibliography on modern Dirac delta functions in the context of an infinitesimal-enriched continuum provided by the hyperreals. Here the Dirac delta can be given by an actual function, having the property that for every real function F one has formula_78 as anticipated by Fourier and Cauchy.\nDirac comb.\nA so-called uniform \"pulse train\" of Dirac delta measures, which is known as a Dirac comb, or as the Sha distribution, creates a sampling function, often used in digital signal processing (DSP) and discrete time signal analysis. The Dirac comb is given as the infinite sum, whose limit is understood in the distribution sense,\nformula_79\nwhich is a sequence of point masses at each of the integers.\nUp to an overall normalizing constant, the Dirac comb is equal to its own Fourier transform. This is significant because if f is any Schwartz function, then the periodization of f is given by the convolution\nformula_80\nIn particular,\nformula_81\nis precisely the Poisson summation formula.\nMore generally, this formula remains to be true if f is a tempered distribution of rapid descent or, equivalently, if formula_82 is a slowly growing, ordinary function within the space of tempered distributions.\nSokhotski\u2013Plemelj theorem.\nThe Sokhotski\u2013Plemelj theorem, important in quantum mechanics, relates the delta function to the distribution p.v., the Cauchy principal value of the function , defined by\nformula_83\nSokhotsky's formula states that\nformula_84\nHere the limit is understood in the distribution sense, that for all compactly supported smooth functions f,\nformula_85\nRelationship to the Kronecker delta.\nThe Kronecker delta \u03b4ij is the quantity defined by\nformula_86\nfor all integers i, j. This function then satisfies the following analog of the sifting property: if ai (for i in the set of all integers) is any doubly infinite sequence, then\nformula_87\nSimilarly, for any real or complex valued continuous function f on R, the Dirac delta satisfies the sifting property\nformula_88\nThis exhibits the Kronecker delta function as a discrete analog of the Dirac delta function.\nApplications.\nProbability theory.\nIn probability theory and statistics, the Dirac delta function is often used to represent a discrete distribution, or a partially discrete, partially continuous distribution, using a probability density function (which is normally used to represent absolutely continuous distributions). For example, the probability density function \"f\"(\"x\") of a discrete distribution consisting of points x = {\"x\"1, ..., \"xn\"}, with corresponding probabilities \"p\"1, ..., \"pn\", can be written as\nformula_89\nAs another example, consider a distribution in which 6/10 of the time returns a standard normal distribution, and 4/10 of the time returns exactly the value 3.5 (i.e. a partly continuous, partly discrete mixture distribution). The density function of this distribution can be written as\nformula_90\nThe delta function is also used to represent the resulting probability density function of a random variable that is transformed by continuously differentiable function. If \"Y\" = g(\"X\") is a continuous differentiable function, then the density of Y can be written as\nformula_91\nThe delta function is also used in a completely different way to represent the local time of a diffusion process (like Brownian motion). The local time of a stochastic process \"B\"(\"t\") is given by\nformula_92\nand represents the amount of time that the process spends at the point x in the range of the process. More precisely, in one dimension this integral can be written\nformula_93\nwhere formula_94 is the indicator function of the interval formula_95\nQuantum mechanics.\nThe delta function is expedient in quantum mechanics. The wave function of a particle gives the probability amplitude of finding a particle within a given region of space. Wave functions are assumed to be elements of the Hilbert space \"L\"2 of square-integrable functions, and the total probability of finding a particle within a given interval is the integral of the magnitude of the wave function squared over the interval. A set {} of wave functions is orthonormal if\nformula_96\nwhere \u03b4nm is the Kronecker delta. A set of orthonormal wave functions is complete in the space of square-integrable functions if any wave function can be expressed as a linear combination of the {} with complex coefficients:\nformula_97\nwhere \"cn\" = \u27e8\"\u03c6n\"|\"\u03c8\"\u27e9. Complete orthonormal systems of wave functions appear naturally as the eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian (of a bound system) in quantum mechanics that measures the energy levels, which are called the eigenvalues. The set of eigenvalues, in this case, is known as the spectrum of the Hamiltonian. In bra\u2013ket notation this equality implies the resolution of the identity:\nformula_98\nHere the eigenvalues are assumed to be discrete, but the set of eigenvalues of an observable can also be continuous. An example is the position operator, \"Q\u03c8\"(\"x\") = \"x\"\u03c8(\"x\"). The spectrum of the position (in one dimension) is the entire real line and is called a continuous spectrum. However, unlike the Hamiltonian, the position operator lacks proper eigenfunctions. The conventional way to overcome this shortcoming is to widen the class of available functions by allowing distributions as well, i.e., to replace the Hilbert space with a rigged Hilbert space. In this context, the position operator has a complete set of \"generalized eigenfunctions\", labeled by the points y of the real line, given by\nformula_99\nThe generalized eigenfunctions of the position operator are called the \"eigenkets\" and are denoted by \"\u03c6y\" = |\"y\"\u27e9.\nSimilar considerations apply to any other (unbounded) self-adjoint operator with continuous spectrum and no degenerate eigenvalues, such as the momentum operator P. In that case, there is a set \u03a9 of real numbers (the spectrum) and a collection of distributions \u03c6y with \"y\" \u2208 \u03a9 such that\nformula_100\nThat is, \u03c6y are the generalized eigenvectors of P. If they form an \"orthonormal basis\" in the distribution sense, that is:\nformula_101\nthen for any test function \u03c8,\nformula_102\nwhere \"c\"(\"y\") = \u27e8\"\u03c8\", \"\u03c6y\"\u27e9. That is, there is a resolution of the identity\nformula_103\nwhere the operator-valued integral is again understood in the weak sense. If the spectrum of P has both continuous and discrete parts, then the resolution of the identity involves a summation over the discrete spectrum and an integral over the continuous spectrum.\nThe delta function also has many more specialized applications in quantum mechanics, such as the delta potential models for a single and double potential well.\nStructural mechanics.\nThe delta function can be used in structural mechanics to describe transient loads or point loads acting on structures. The governing equation of a simple mass\u2013spring system excited by a sudden force impulse I at time \"t\" = 0 can be written\nformula_104\nwhere m is the mass, \u03be is the deflection, and k is the spring constant.\nAs another example, the equation governing the static deflection of a slender beam is, according to Euler\u2013Bernoulli theory,\nformula_105\nwhere EI is the bending stiffness of the beam, w is the deflection, x is the spatial coordinate, and \"q\"(\"x\") is the load distribution. If a beam is loaded by a point force F at \"x\" = \"x\"0, the load distribution is written\nformula_106\nAs the integration of the delta function results in the Heaviside step function, it follows that the static deflection of a slender beam subject to multiple point loads is described by a set of piecewise polynomials.\nAlso, a point moment acting on a beam can be described by delta functions. Consider two opposing point forces F at a distance d apart. They then produce a moment \"M\" = \"Fd\" acting on the beam. Now, let the distance d approach the limit zero, while M is kept constant. The load distribution, assuming a clockwise moment acting at \"x\" = 0, is written\nformula_107\nPoint moments can thus be represented by the derivative of the delta function. Integration of the beam equation again results in piecewise polynomial deflection.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Historically, the term referred to a courtier, a person who attended the court of a monarch or other powerful person.\nHistory.\nIn European feudal society, the court was the centre of government as well as the residence of the monarch, and social and political life were often completely mixed together. Prior to the Renaissance, courtesans served to convey information to visiting dignitaries, when servants could not be trusted. In Renaissance Europe, courtiers played an extremely important role in upper-class society. As it was customary during this time for royal couples to lead separate lives\u2014commonly marrying simply to preserve bloodlines and to secure political alliances\u2014men and women would often seek gratification and companionship from people living at court. In fact, the verb 'to court' originally meant \"to be or reside at court\", and later came to mean \"to behave as a courtier\" and then 'courtship', or \"to pay amorous attention to somebody\". The most intimate companion of a ruler was called the \"favourite\".\nIn Renaissance usage, the Italian word \"cortigiana\", feminine of \"cortigiano\" (\"courtier\"), came to refer to a person who attends the court, and then to a well-educated and independent woman, eventually a trained artist or artisan of dance and singing, especially one associated with wealthy, powerful, or upper-class society who was given luxuries and status in exchange for entertainment and companionship. In English, the word was borrowed from Italian during the 16th century through the French form \"courtisane\", especially associated with the meaning of \"donna di palazzo\".\nA male figure comparable to the courtesan was the Italian \"cicisbeo\", the French \"chevalier servant\", the Spanish \"cortejo\" or \"estrecho\".\nThe courtesans of East Asia, particularly those of the Japanese empire, held a different social role than that of their European counterparts. Examples of Japanese courtesans included the oiran class, who were more focused on the aspect of entertainment than European courtesans.\nCourtesans or dancers of ancient India known as \"ganika\" were the center of city life. According to historian Sanjay K. Gautam, they symbolized \"both sexual-erotic and aesthetic pleasure\".\nCategories.\nOne type of courtesan was known (in Italy) as the \"cortigiana onesta\", or the honest courtesan, who was cast as an intellectual. Another was the \"cortigiana di lume\", a lower class of courtesan. The former was the sort most often romanticized and treated more-or-less equal to women of the nobility. It is with this type of courtesan that the art of \"courtisanerie\" is best associated.\nThe \"cortigiane oneste\" were usually well-educated and worldly (sometimes even more so than the average upper-class woman), and often held simultaneous careers as performers or artists. They were typically chosen on the basis of their \"breeding\"\u2014social and conversational skills, intelligence, common sense, and companionship\u2014as well as their physical attributes. It was usually their wit and personality that set them apart from regular women. Sex constituted only a facet of the courtesan's array of services. For example, they were well-dressed and ready to engage and participate in a variety of topics ranging from art to music to politics.\nIn some cases, courtesans were from well-to-do backgrounds, and were even married\u2014but to husbands lower on the social ladder than their clients. In these cases, their relationships with those of high social status had the potential to improve their spouses' status\u2014and so, more often than not, the husband was aware of his wife's profession and dealings.\nDifferences in status.\nAs primary employment.\nCourtesans from non-wealthy backgrounds provided charming companionship for extended periods, no matter what their own feelings or commitments might have been at the time, and sometimes had to be prepared to do so on short notice. They were also subject to lower social status, and often religious disapproval, because of the perceived immoral aspects of their profession and their reliance upon courtisanerie as a primary source of income. In cases like this, a courtesan was solely dependent on her benefactor or benefactors financially, making her vulnerable; Cora Pearl is a good example.\nOften, courtesans serving in this capacity began their career as a prostitute, although many came to the profession by other means. It was not uncommon for a courtesan to enter into an arranged long-term liaison by contract with a wealthy benefactor. These contracts were written up by and witnessed by lawyers and were binding. Most included some provision for the financial welfare of the courtesan beyond the end of the relationship in the form of an annuity. Many such women became so powerful socially and financially that they could be particular about the men they associated with; in other words, they chose their paramour as would any other mistress, not the other way around. Wealthy benefactors would go to great lengths to court a courtesan as a prize, the ultimate goal being a long-term contract as a mistress.\nOccasionally courtesans were passed from one benefactor to another, thereby resulting in them being viewed in society circles as lower than both their benefactor and those of wealth and power with whom they would socialise. Often, in instances of this sort, if the courtesan had satisfactorily served a benefactor, that benefactor would, when ending the affair, pass her on to another benefactor of wealth as a favour to the courtesan, or set her up in an arranged marriage to a semi-wealthy benefactor. If the courtesan had angered or dissatisfied a benefactor, then she would often find herself cast out of wealthy circles, returning more often than not to street prostitution.\n\"Should not be confused with a royal mistress\"\nFor social or political benefits.\nThose from wealthy backgrounds, either by birth or marriage, and who were acting as courtesans only for the social or political advancement of themselves and/or their spouses were generally treated as equals. They were more respected by their extramarital companions, both placing one another's family obligations ahead of the relationship and planning their own liaisons or social engagements around the lovers' marital obligations.\nAffairs of this sort would often be short-lived, ending when either the courtesan or the courtesan's spouse received the status or political position desired, or when the benefactor chose the company of another courtesan, and compensated the former companion financially. In instances like this, it was often viewed simply as a business agreement by both parties involved. The benefactor was aware of the political or social favors expected by the courtesan, the courtesan was aware of the price expected from them for those favors being carried out, and the two met one another's demands.\nThis was generally a safe affair, as both the benefactor's spouse and the courtesan's spouse usually were fully aware of the arrangement, and the courtesan was not solely dependent on the benefactor. It, rather, was simply an affair of benefits gained for both those involved. Publicly and socially, affairs of this sort were common during the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, as well as the early 20th century, and were generally accepted in wealthy circles.\nCareer length.\nIn later centuries, from the mid-18th century on, courtesans would often find themselves cast aside by their benefactors, but the days of public execution or imprisonment based on their promiscuous lifestyle were over. There are many examples of courtesans who, by remaining discreet and respectful to their benefactors, were able to extend their careers into or past middle age and retire financially secure; Catherine Walters is a good example. By the late 19th century, and for a brief period in the early 20th century, courtesans had reached a level of social acceptance in many circles and settings, often even to the extent of becoming a friend and confidant to the wife of their benefactor.\nMore often than not, a woman serving as a courtesan would last in that field only as long as she could prove herself useful to her companion, or companions. This, of course, excludes those who served as courtesans but who were already married into high society. When referring to those who made their service as a courtesan as their main source of income, success was based solely on financial management and longevity. Many climbed through the ranks of royalty, serving as mistress to lesser nobles first, eventually reaching the role of (unofficial) mistress to a king or prince.\nPietro Aretino, an Italian Renaissance writer, wrote a series of dialogues (\"Capricciosi ragionamenti\") in which a mother teaches her daughter what options are available to women and how to be an effective courtesan. In eighteenth-century French literature, the courtesan tends to be idealised as a beautiful and intellectually refined figure of classical antiquity, who invariably enjoys excellent health and is untouched by the contemporary societal scourge of syphilis (often politely referred to as \"smallpox\") and other sexually transmitted diseases. The French novelist Balzac wrote about a courtesan in his \"Splendeurs et mis\u00e8res des courtisanes\" (1838\u201347). \u00c9mile Zola likewise wrote a novel, \"Nana\" (1880), about a courtesan in nineteenth-century France.\nFamous courtesans.\nThis is a list of some professional courtesans. They are not royal mistresses, unless a professional courtesan was also a royal mistress.\nSeparately from this list, the term \"courtesan\" has been used in a political context in an attempt to damage the reputation of a powerful woman or disparage her importance. Because of this, there is still much historical debate over whether certain women in history were courtesans. For example, the title was applied to the Byzantine empress Theodora, who had started life as an erotic actress, but later became the wife of the Emperor Justinian and, after her death, an Orthodox saint.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "37023", "revid": "27556023", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37023", "title": "Conservatorship", "text": "Legal term and authority\nUnder U.S. law, a conservatorship results from the appointment of a guardian or a protector by a judge to manage the personal or financial affairs of another person who is incapable of fully managing their own affairs due to age or physical or mental limitations. A person under conservatorship is a \"conservatee\", a term that can refer to an adult. A person under guardianship is a \"ward\", a term that can also refer to a minor child. Conservatorship may also apply to corporations and organizations.\nThe conservator may be only of the \"estate\" (financial affairs) but may be also of the \"person\", wherein the conservator takes charge of overseeing the daily activities, such as healthcare or living arrangements of the conservatee. A conservator of the person is more typically called a legal guardian. In 2021, an estimated 1.3 million people in the U.S. were under conservatorship.\nTerminology.\nA person appointed to manage affairs is a conservator. A person under conservatorship is a conservatee. Under a guardianship, the appointed person is a guardian and subject person is a ward. When referring to government control of private corporations, conservatorship implies a more temporary control than does nationalisation.\nSome jurisdictions, such as California, distinguish between conservatorship of an adult as compared to an unemancipated minor. Within such a jurisdiction, a person who is under what is more typically described as a guardianship may be described as a \"conservator of the person\". Other jurisdictions, such as New York, use the term guardianship in both contexts.\nA \"limited conservatorship\" usually refers to the limited legal responsibilities of a conservator over the affairs of an individual who is developmentally disabled, but still capable of making important decisions for themselves. In these cases, the conservatee to whom the limited conservatorship applies can retain more control over their personal affairs than other conservatees can; for example, they may retain their right to decide where they may live.\nAppointment.\nConservatorship is established either by court order (with regard to individuals) or via a statutory or regulatory authority (with regard to organizations such as business entities). In other legal terms, a conservatorship may refer to the legal responsibilities over a person who has a mental illness, including individuals who are psychotic, suicidal, demented, incapacitated, or in some other way unable to make legal, medical or financial decisions on behalf of themselves.\nRole and duties.\nConservatorship is a legal term referring to the legal responsibilities of a conservator over the affairs of a person who has been deemed gravely disabled by the court and unable to meet their basic needs of food, clothing, and shelter. They are governed by the state's individual laws. Terminology varies, and some states or jurisdictions may refer to a conservator as a guardian of the estate or as a trustee.\nConservatorships are generally put in place for people who are significantly disabled by mental illness, elderly individuals who lack mental capacity due to medical conditions such as dementia, or individuals with developmental disabilities who lack the capacity to manage their own affairs. In typical conservatorship proceedings, an allegedly mentally incapacitated person must be evaluated by a qualified physician or psychiatrist who prepares a report documenting the person's mental capacity that is provided to the court and may be used as evidence.\nAn example of a conservator's duties includes: locating and marshalling assets, such as property and money, which belong to the conservatee; using the assets to buy food for the conservatee, secure and pay for placement in a facility which would take care of the conservatee or treat a mental illness, pay bills for the conservatee, manage property by paying for property insurance, mortgage payments or rent, property clean-up, or pay for a property management company to rent the property. An example of a conservator or guardian's medical responsibilities would be the court granting medical authority to the conservator or guardian, and the conservator or guardian authorising a physician to place a feeding tube to provide nourishment into the protected person's stomach if they are in medical need of it. It is not uncommon for one person to hold both offices and be referred to as the \"guardian and conservator\" of the conservatee, even though a conservator or guardian can be appointed over the person only, the estate only, or both. Generally, a conservator or guardian over the estate is only appointed if the conservatee has assets that need to be protected, marshalled, and managed. These terms may be found in use in Uniform Probate Code (UPC) jurisdictions, even though the UPC uses the term \"protected person\" in either case.\nIn most states, an outside party or agency must review the facts of the case and submit a report, usually required to be in writing, to the court before the court makes a decision on the request to establish a conservatorship or guardianship. Usually the outside party is a local county mental health representative called an investigator. They are often required to be experts in some appropriate field, such as social work, mental health, a medical field, or law. Procedures for conservatorship of an adult are often different from those for minors. \nThe court may appoint an attorney to represent the proposed conservatee or ward. If the proposed conservatee or ward is unable to have an attorney-client relationship because of some impairment, the court may appoint a guardian-ad-litem (who is often also an attorney). A guardian-ad-litem does not take instruction from the client, but rather acts on their behalf and tells the court what they think is in the best interests of the proposed conservatee or ward, whether or not that is what the proposed conservatee or ward wants. The conservatee has the right to be represented by an attorney, and if they cannot afford a private attorney, they are appointed a public defender that will represent them free of cost.\nCalifornia.\nIn the state of California there are two types of conservatorships: Lanterman\u2013Petris\u2013Short (Lanterman\u2013Petris\u2013Short Act of 1967, referred to as LPS) and Probate conservatorships. These forms of conservatorship are governed by the California Probate Code, and Welfare and Institutions Codes.\nLPS conservatorships begin with a temporary 30-day conservatorship, and if the conservatee remains gravely disabled, the conservator is reappointed for a year; the LPS conservatorship can be renewed annually, or terminated if no longer needed. Probate conservatorships are referred to as \"general conservatorships\", and typically do not have a temporary period unless an urgent emergency exists that is creating risk to the person or their estate. Probate conservatorship do not automatically expire as LPS conservatorships do if they are not renewed by the conservator.\nIn an LPS conservatorship, a court-appointed conservator over the person is responsible for managing the conservatee's placement, medical decisions, and mental health treatment. A conservator over the estate is responsible for marshalling, protecting, and managing the conservatee's assets that remain in their estate. A conservator reports to the court that appointed them, and is monitored by the supervising judicial court in the county in which the conservatee permanently resides.\nLPS conservatorships usually begin in the county mental health system and are referred from acute psychiatric hospitals, where Probate conservatorships can result from any referral source if validated with proper medical documentation. Mental Health consumers have the right to a Patient's Rights advocate, and are taken through a series of hearings while they are in the acute hospital before they reach the point of needing a conservator.\nIn 2022, a law was enacted requiring judges in California to document all alternatives to a conservatorship before granting one, giving potential conservatees in California preference in selecting a conservator, and making it easier to end probate conservatorships in California.\nInternational equivalents.\nConservatorship for individuals is called \"deputyship\" in England, Wales and in Switzerland (formerly \"guardianship\"), \"guardianship\" in Scotland, \"controllership\" in Northern Ireland, \"guardianship\" in India and \"guardianship and administration\" in Australia.\nSouth Korea.\nIn the Republic of Korea (South Korea) a Conservatorship is called a Guardianship.\nTypes of Guardians under Korean Guardianship Law\nAdult guardian (\uc131\ub144\ud6c4\uacac\uc778): If an adult chronically lacks the mental competence to manage their own matters due to illness, disability, old age, or other conditions, a Korean court may appoint an adult guardian. This type of guardianship in Korea gives near total power over the ward to the Adult Guardian. \nLimited guardian (\ud55c\uc815\ud6c4\uacac\uc778): A person may also be designated as a \"special guardian,\" entrusted with restricted authority over the ward's interests. For example, a special guardian may be granted the legal authority in Korea to decide how to handle the ward's assets without being granted any control over the ward's person.\nSpecified guardian (\ud2b9\uc815\ud6c4\uacac\uc778): A specified guardian is a person appointed to represent a person's interests in relation to a particular court proceeding or process. \nThe process of appointing a guardian through Korean courts.\nThe Korean Family Courts, typically, has the authority to appoint a guardian in Korea. A general adult guardian is one who is in charge of both the ward's financial interests and personal welfare. The Korean family court, or one of its branches, has authority over the ward's address and will hear the guardianship case. When the Family Court is not present in the ward's address, typically, a district court or a branch court has jurisdiction over the matter. \nTypically, after an evaluation of the ward's health by a doctor, the court proceedings begin. The court will often question the ward and hear his/her testimony regarding the guardianship. So that the ward can make the most use of his or her remaining capacity and choose a suitable guardian. The court has the power to decide the beginning of guardianship, the choice of a guardian, change of guardian, cessation of guardianship, the extent of the legal representative's authority, etc.\nConservatorship of organizations.\nIn the United States, in some states, corporations can be placed under conservatorship, as a less extreme alternative to receivership. Whereas a receiver is expected to terminate the rights of shareholders and managers, a conservator is expected merely to assume those rights, with the prospect that they will be relinquished. Robert Ramsey and John Head, law professors who both specialise in financial issues, suggest that an insolvent bank should go into receivership rather than conservatorship to guard against false hope and moral hazard.\nAt the federal government level in the United States, in July 2008, the failing IndyMac Bank was taken into administrative receivership by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and its assets and secured liabilities transferred to a specially established bridge bank called IndyMac Federal Bank, FSB which was placed into conservatorship, also by the FDIC.\nAgain, in the U.S. at the federal level, in September 2008, the chief executive officers and board of directors of Fannie Mae and of Freddie Mac were dismissed. Then, the companies were placed into the conservatorship of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) via the determination of its director James B. Lockhart III, with the support and financial backing of U.S. Treasury via Treasury secretary Hank Paulson's commitment to keep the corporations solvent. The intervention leading to the conservatorship of these two entities has become the largest in government history, and was justified as necessary step to prevent the damage to the financial system that would have been caused by their failure. Entities like this are considered \"too big to fail\".\nAn even more ambitious use of the conservatorship model has been proposed by Duke University professors Lawrence Baxter, Bill Brown, and Jim Cox. They suggest that the troubled U.S. banks be placed in conservatorship, that some of their \"good assets\" be dropped into newly created \"good bank\" subsidiaries (presumably under new management), and the remaining \"bad assets\" be left to be managed under the supervision of a conservatorship structure.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

These contestants are selected from the studio audience, and are called onstage to compete by the announcer using the show's catch phrase of \"come on down!\"\nThe program premiered September 4, 1972, on CBS. Bob Barker was the series's longest-running host from its debut until his retirement in June 2007, when Drew Carey took over. Johnny Olson was the show's original announcer, holding this role until just before his death in 1985. He was replaced by Rod Roddy, who remained with the show until just before his own death in late 2003. Rich Fields took over as announcer in 2004, and was replaced with George Gray in 2011.

This area is known as \"Contestants' Row\" or \"Bidders' Row\". After calling each selected contestant's name, the announcer shouts \"Come on down!\", the show's catch phrase.\nThe four contestants in Contestants' Row compete in a bidding round, sometimes referred to as \"One Bid\", to determine which contestant will play the next pricing game. A prize is shown and each contestant gives a single bid for the item in whole dollars, as the price is rounded to the nearest dollar. In the first One Bid game of each episode, bidding begins with the contestant on the viewer's left (usually, the first contestant who came down to the Contestant's Row) and proceeds right. A contestant may not duplicate another's bid. The contestant whose bid is closest to the actual retail price of the prize without going over wins that prize, and gets to play the subsequent pricing game. If all four contestants' bids are higher than the actual retail price, all bids are erased, and the contestants are instructed to bid a second time without exceeding the lowest bid of the previous round. Bidding the exact price awards a $500 cash bonus.\nAfter each of the first five pricing games, another contestant is called to \"come on down\" to fill the spot of the contestant who played the previous pricing game. Subsequent One Bid rounds begin with the newest contestant and wrap around. Contestants who fail to win a One Bid round and do not make it onstage to play a pricing game receive consolation prizes, often sponsored by companies revealed by the announcer near the end of the show.\nA 1996 study from Stanford University analyzed the bidding behavior of contestants, noting that they rarely attempted to optimize their bidding strategies but that accuracy tended to improve the longer they stayed in Contestants' Row. A 2019 study from Harvard University noted that the accuracy of the average bid fell substantially over the course of the show's run, from 8% lower than the actual retail price at the series start in 1972 to over 20% by 2010, before stabilizing throughout the 2010s. The study concluded that accuracy correlated with inflation and hypothesized that periods of high inflation make people more attentive to prices, while also surmising that increasing e-commerce has made people less attentive to prices overall.\nPricing games.\nThe winner of the One Bid joins the host onstage for the opportunity to win additional prizes or cash by playing a pricing game. After the pricing game ends, a new contestant is selected for Contestants' Row and the process is repeated.\nSix pricing games are played on each hour-long episode. Pricing game formats vary widely, ranging from simple dilemma games in which a contestant chooses one of two options to win, to complex games of chance or skill in which guessing prices increases the odds of winning. On a typical hour-long episode, two games are played for a car, one game is played for a cash prize, and the other three games offer expensive household merchandise or trips. Usually, at least one of the six games involves the pricing of grocery items, while another usually involves smaller prizes that can be used to win a larger prize package.\nOriginally, five pricing games were in the rotation. Since then, more games have been created and added to the rotation. Some pricing games were eventually discontinued, while others have been a mainstay since the show's debut in 1972. As of 2017, the rotation is among 77 games.\nShowcase Showdown.\nThe game also features two Showcase Showdown rounds, held after all six pricing games have been played (a procedural change starting early in Season 51 tapings; prior to 2021, they were held after the third and sixth pricing games). The three contestants who played each pricing game in each half compete to spin a vertical wheel, known as \"the Big Wheel\", to determine who will proceed to the show's final round known as the Showcase. The contestants play in the order of the value of their winnings per half (including the One Bid), with the contestant who has won the most spinning last. A coin toss will determine who has the advantage in case of a tie; furthermore, since the 2021 administrative change, the players in the first three pricing games play first, followed by the second three. This change was made for logistics, since three (and since four) episodes are taped in a day. The first Showdown is edited into the broadcast after the third pricing game, and the second Showdown is edited in after the sixth game.\nThe wheel contains 20 sections showing values from 5\u00a2 to $1.00, in increments of five cents. Upon spinning, the contestant may choose to accept the value of the first spin, or take a second spin and accept the combined value of the two. After the first contestant has finished spinning, the second and third must beat or tie the value of the first contestant's spin; failure to do so in two spins, or having two spins whose combined value is greater than $1.00, eliminates a contestant from the Showcase Showdown. If the first two players spin over $1.00, then the third player wins by default and has only one spin. Whichever contestant has achieved the highest spin value proceeds to the Showcase. Contestants who are unable to spin the wheel on their own are allowed to have another person spin on their behalf. Contestants who achieve an exact score of $1.00 in one or two spins are awarded a cash bonus and a chance to spin the wheel again, known as a \"bonus spin\". During a \"bonus spin\", a cash bonus of $25,000 is given if the wheel lands on the $1.00 space again, and $10,000 for landing on the 5\u00a2 or 15\u00a2 spaces. In the event of a tie, each contestant who is tied is allowed another singular spin of the wheel to break the tie, with the highest-valued spin resulting in that contestant proceeding to the Showcase.\nShowcase.\nAt the end of the episode, the two Showcase Showdown winners advance to the Showcase. A package of prizes, referred to as a \"showcase\", is presented by the announcer and models. Occasionally, prizes may have a common theme, or serve as plot devices within a comedic skit acted out by the announcer and models. The higher-scoring contestant may choose to bid on the showcase, or pass it to their opponent, who must then make a bid. Afterward, a second \"showcase\" is presented to the other contestant, who must then make a bid. After a commercial break, the host reveals the value of each showcase, with the winner being determined by whoever bid closer without going over the value. Should both contestants' bids be over-valued, neither contestant wins a showcase. A contestant who is within $250 of the value without over-bidding wins both prize packages, known as a \"double showcase win\". \nIn articles and interviews concerning the show, the showcase is often mistakenly referred to as the showcase showdown.\nThe 2017 documentary \"\" tells the story of the one contestant who bid the exact price of a showcase, which occurred on an episode taped in September 2008.\nPersonnel.\nHosts.\nBob Barker began hosting \"The Price Is Right\" on September 4, 1972, and completed a 35-year tenure on June 15, 2007. Barker was hired as host while still hosting the stunt comedy show \"Truth or Consequences\". His retirement coincided with his 50th year as a television host. His final show aired on June 15, 2007, and was repeated in primetime, leading into the network's coverage of the 34th Daytime Emmy Awards. In addition to hosting, Barker became executive producer of the show in March 1988 when Frank Wayne died and continued as such until his retirement, gaining significant creative control over the series between 2000 and his 2007 retirement. He was also responsible for creating several of the show's pricing games, as well as launching \"The Price Is Right $1,000,000 Spectacular\" primetime spin-off. Reruns of Barker's final season were aired throughout the summer from the Monday after his final show (June 18, 2007) until the Friday before Drew Carey's debut as host (October 12, 2007), when the season 35 finale was re-aired. During his time as host, Barker missed only one taping of four episodes. Dennis James, then hosting the syndicated nighttime version of the show, filled in for him on these shows in December 1974. In 1981, shortly after the death of his wife Dorothy Jo, Barker became an animal rights advocate and vegetarian, and began signing off each episode with \"Help control the pet population, have your pets spayed or neutered.\" After Barker's retirement, Carey continued the tradition with the same sign-off.\nOn October 31, 2006, Barker announced that he would retire from the show at the end of season 35. In March 2007, CBS and FremantleMedia began a search for the next host of the show. Carey, who was hosting \"Power of 10\" at the time, was chosen and, in a July 23, 2007, interview on \"Late Show with David Letterman\", made the announcement. Carey's first show aired October 15, 2007. Barker made three guest appearances after Carey took over as host: on the April 16, 2009 episode to promote his autobiography, \"Priceless Memories\", on December 12, 2013, as part of \"Pet Adoption Week\" that coincided with his 90th birthday, and on the episode which aired on April Fools' Day in 2015, his final appearance on the show, where he hosted the first One Bid and pricing game as part of April Fool's Day.\nThe 2013 April Fools' show featured Carey and announcer George Gray modeling the prizes while the show's models performed hosting and announcing duties for the day. On the April Fools' Day episode in 2014, Craig Ferguson, Carey's former castmate from \"The Drew Carey Show\", and Shadoe Stevens hosted and announced, swapping places with Carey and Gray, who had performed those roles on the previous night's episode of \"The Late Late Show\". The 2015 April Fools' episode featured the last of Barker's three post-retirement appearances on the show, where he hosted the first One Bid and pricing game before turning it over to Carey.\nAnnouncers.\nJohnny Olson, the announcer for many Goodson-Todman shows of the era, was the program's first announcer until his death in October 1985. Olson was replaced by Rod Roddy in December 1985, who remained with the program until shortly before his death in October 2003. Los Angeles meteorologist Rich Fields took over as the announcer in April 2004 and stayed on until the end of season 38 in August 2010. Following a change of direction and a search for an announcer with more experience in improvisational comedy, George Gray became announcer in December 2010, and was permanently made as the show's fourth announcer in April 2011.\nDuring periods in which a permanent announcer was not filling the role, a number of announcers auditioned for the position. In addition to Roddy, Gene Wood, Rich Jeffries, and Bob Hilton auditioned to replace Olson. Burton Richardson, Paul Boland and Randy West substituted for Roddy during his illnesses. In addition to West and Richardson, Daniel Rosen, Art Sanders, Roger Rose, Don Bishop, and Jim Thornton also auditioned for the role eventually filled by Fields. Richardson substituted for Fields while he recovered from laryngitis in December 2006. In addition to Gray, JD Roberto, Jeff B. Davis, Brad Sherwood, David H. Lawrence\u00a0XVII, and Steve White also auditioned for the role.\nModels.\nTo help display its many prizes, the show has featured several models who were known, during Barker's time on the show, as \"Barker's Beauties\u201d. Some longer-tenured Barker's Beauties included Kathleen Bradley (1990\u20132000), Holly Hallstrom (1977\u20131995), Dian Parkinson (1975\u20131993), Janice Pennington (1972\u20132000), and Rachel Reynolds (2003-present). Hallstrom and Parkinson both filed suits against Barker for a hostile work environment; Parkinson withdrew her suit, but Hallstrom's was successful. Pennington, in contrast, had mostly positive experiences with Barker. Following the departures of Nikki Ziering, Heather Kozar, and Claudia Jordan in the 2000s, producers decided to use a rotating cast of models (up to ten) until the middle of season 37, after which the show reverted to a cast of five regular models, increasing to six in 2021. Current models include Rachel Reynolds, Amber Lancaster, Manuela Arbel\u00e1ez, James O'Halloran, Devin Goda, and Alexis Gaube. Rachel began her tenure with Barker, and is the second-longest running model in show history, trailing only Pennington.\nCarey does not use a collective name for the models, but refers to them by name, hoping that the models will be able to use the show as a \"springboard\" to further their careers. In a change from previous policy, the models appearing on a given episode are named individually in the show's credits and are formally referred as \"\"The Price Is Right\" models\" when collectively grouped at events. Since season 37, the show often uses a guest model for certain prizes, often crossing over from another CBS property or come courtesy of the company providing the prize. Some such models have been male, especially for musical instruments, tools, trucks and motorcycles, and used in guest appearances during the Showcase. Owing to the traditionally female demographic of daytime television shows, along with the pregnancies of Rachel and then-model Gwendolyn Osborne, CBS announced that the game show would add a male model for a week during season 41, fitting with other countries with the franchise that have used an occasional male model. The show held an internet search for the man in an online competition that featured Mike Richards, the show's executive producer, Reynolds, Lancaster, Osborne and Arbel\u00e1ez serving as judges and mentors during the web series, narrated by Gray. Viewers selected the winner in October 2012. On October 5, 2012, CBS announced that the winner of the male model online competition was Rob Wilson of Boston, Massachusetts. Wilson appeared as a model on episodes through April 15, 2014. A second male model search was conducted in 2014, with auditions taking place during the FIFA World Cup break between May and July 2014. On December 8, 2014, CBS announced that the winner of the second male model online competition was James O'Halloran. A third male model, Devin Goda, debuted on the show in 2018.\nProduction staff.\nThe game show production team of Mark Goodson and Bill Todman was responsible for producing the original as well as the revival versions of the game show. Goodson-Todman staffer Bob Stewart is credited with creating the original version of \"The Price Is Right\". Roger Dobkowitz was the producer from 1984 to 2008, having worked with the program as a production staffer since the show's debut after graduating from San Francisco State University. Occasionally, Dobkowitz appeared on-camera when answering a question posed by the host, usually relating to the show's history or records. When he left the show at the end of season 36, \"Variety\" reported that it was unclear whether he was retiring or was fired, although Carey indicated in a later interview with \"Esquire\" that Dobkowitz was fired. \nAs of 2011, the show uses multiple producers, all long-time staffers. Adam Sandler (not to be confused with the actor) is the producer and director of the show. Stan Blits, who joined the show in 1980 and Sue MacIntyre are the co-producers. Stan Blits is also the contestant coordinator for the show. In 2007, he wrote the book \"Come on Down\" (), that goes behind the scenes of the show. In the book he dispels the myth that contestants are chosen at random, and gives readers an inside look at how shows are planned and produced. Kathy Greco joined the show in 1975 and became producer in 2008; she announced her retirement on October 8, 2010, on the show's website, effective at the end of the December 2010 tapings. Her last episode as producer, which aired January 27, 2011, featured a theme in tribute to her. The show's official website featured a series of videos including an interview with Greco as a tribute to her 35 years in the days leading up to her final episode. Frank Wayne, a Goodson-Todman staffer since the 1950s, was the original executive producer of the CBS version of the show. Barker assumed that role after Wayne's death in March 1988. Previous producers have included Jay Wolpert, Barbara Hunter, and Phil Wayne Rossi (Wayne's son). Michael Dimich assumed the director's chair in June 2011. Marc Breslow, Paul Alter, Bart Eskander, and Rich DiPirro each served long stints previously as director. Former associate directors Andrew Felsher and Fred Witten, as well as technical director Glenn Koch, have directed episodes strictly on a fill-in basis. Sandler began directing episodes in 2012, and became the official director in 2013. \nAside from Barker, the show's production staff remained intact after Carey became host. FremantleMedia executive Syd Vinnedge was named the program's new executive producer, with Richards becoming co-executive producer after Dobkowitz's firing. Richards was a candidate to replace Barker as host in 2007, before Carey was ultimately chosen. Richards succeeded Vinnedge as executive producer when the 2009\u201310 season started, with Tracy Verna Soiseth joining Richards as co-executive producer in 2010. Vinnedge remains credited as an executive consultant to the show. Richards oversaw a major overhaul of the show, dismissing some personnel who had served under Barker and Dobkowitz in an effort to improve the show's performance in key demographics, which continued a change in the demographic of viewers after the movie \"Happy Gilmore\" (which featured Barker in a fight). Richards returned to the show for the Barker tribute in August 2023. At the start of the 2013\u201314 season, FremantleMedia executive Jennifer Mullin joined as a second executive producer, she served in that role until the end of the 2017\u201318 season when she became the CEO of Fremantle. Richards would stay on until he left the show at the conclusion of the 2018\u201319 season to join Sony Pictures Television as an executive producer for their game shows. Evelyn Warfel was named executive producer for the 2019\u201320 season, where she served in that role until the end of the 2024\u201325 season. John Quinn was then announced as her successor for the 2025\u201326 season.\nProduction.\nAudience and contestant selection.\nPrior to changes imposed in Season 49 (October 2020), audience members often arrived early on the day of a taping, some even camping out the night before to secure a spot in line. Most had already received tickets for that day's show, although some hoped to get same-day tickets.\nStarting in Season 52 with first tapings in July 2023, audience members arrive at Charis Mission Church next door to Haven Studios for a formal process. In the church's meeting rooms, audience members are then given the iconic name tags with a temporary identification number, which are also written on the person's ticket. A Social Security Number (or some national I.D. number for non-U.S. audience members) is also required to be submitted. Audience members are eventually brought through in groups of twelve for brief interviews with the production staff. \nContrary to popular belief, contestant names are not chosen at random; in actuality, the interviews determine the nine contestants from a pool of approximately 165 audience members (reduced from 325 when the show moved to Haven Studios in 2023; in Season 50 and 51 (2021\u201323), it was 50). Since 1988, the minimum age for audience members has been 18 except for family episodes; prior to 1988, teenagers and children were present in the audience. With few exceptions, anyone at least 18 years old who attends a taping of the show has the potential to become a contestant. Those ineligible include current candidates for political office, employees of Paramount Global or its affiliates, RTL Group or any firm involved in offering prizes for the show. Contestants who have appeared on a different game show within the previous year or either two other game shows or any version of \"The Price Is Right\" itself within the past ten years are also ineligible. \nThe show's staff alerts potential contestants\u00a0\u2013 in person, on the show's website and on the tickets themselves\u00a0\u2013 to dress in \"street clothes\" and not to wear costumes, such as those used to attract attention on \"Let's Make a Deal\", another show that selects contestants from the audience. In June 2008, producers disallowed audience members from wearing fake eyeglasses designed to look similar to those worn by Carey, a restriction that has since been relaxed. Instead, contestants will often wear shirts with hand-decorated slogans. Clothing with logos of the Seattle Sounders FC is restricted, as host Drew Carey is a minority partner in the team, and in accordance with RTL Group Standards and Practices, the show must post disclaimers regarding his ownership stake if a contestant is wearing such logo merchandise. Members of the Armed Forces often attend in uniform, which is mandatory on military-themed special episodes such as Independence Day. \nTo ensure fair play, cell phones, electronic devices, backpacks, and price lists are not allowed in the holding room or studio. If an audience member has brought any of these items, they must leave them with production for the duration of the taping. Once they clear protocol, they receive a ticket and access to Haven Studios. At the end of the show, audience members return to the church and check out.\nProspective contestants obtain tickets by contacting a third-party ticketing operator via the show's website, which is promoted on-air during the broadcast. Prior to 2011, ticketing was directly through CBS, originally via mail, with online ticket access added in 2005. The mail practice ended after CBS began outsourcing ticketing to the third-party operator.\nOccasionally, episodes are taped with special audiences, including active duty and retired military personnel. Similar primetime episodes were taped in 2002 in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks and in light of the subsequent war in Afghanistan: one honoring each branch of the United States military and a sixth episode honoring police officers and firefighters. An annual military episode has been taped since season 38 in 2008; such episodes were originally broadcast on Veterans Day, but the airdate was moved to Independence Day during season 41 (2013). These episodes feature an all-military audience, a military band playing the winner's service anthem, and contestants being called by rank. The 2008 episode contained a unique rule in which each One Bid featured one contestant from the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines, and One Bid winners also won a $1,000 gift card. As each contestant won their way onstage, a member of the same branch of service would replace them in Bidder's Row. Most civilian attendees were retired or disabled veterans or family members of military personnel. (The 2009 version eliminated this practice.) Additionally, members from the United States Coast Guard were invited to the show.\nSince 2009, some episodes have featured special themes with two contestants competing as teams, such as married or engaged couples for Valentine's Day and the \"Ultimate Wedding Shower\" episode. Some episodes feature children who are minors (normally not allowed to compete) teamed with a parent (for Mother's Day and Father's Day) or grandparent (for Grandparents Day), as well as teen drivers and students for \"Ultimate Spring Break\" and \"Back to School\u201d. In these cases the adult player (not the minor) must make all final decisions in game play, such as when calling numbers or prices.\nTaping.\nFor the first 51 seasons (1972\u20132023), except for the 2002 30th Anniversary Special, which was taped at Harrah's Rio in Las Vegas, Nevada, \"The Price Is Right\" was taped in Studio 33 at Television City in the Fairfax district of Los Angeles. The studio, which is also used for other television productions, was renamed the Bob Barker Studio in the host's honor on the ceremonial 5,000th episode taped in March 1998. When Carey became host, there was talk of the show traveling in the future. The program is usually produced in about an hour, although if there is a guest involved, some tapings will last longer because of question and answer sessions by the audience and the guest, which the host usually moderates. Typically, the show tapes two episodes per day (mid-day and late afternoon tapings) with Monday through Wednesday tapings. The program is taped in advance of its airdate. For example, the show broadcast on February 28, 2008, was taped on January 16, 2008. After resuming tapings in October 2020 following a pandemic-related delay, starting in season 49 (taped behind closed doors with pandemic restrictions with a late start and accelerated taping), three episodes were taped each day, normally with three taping days per week (Sunday through Tuesday, with a morning, midday, and afternoon session). As with many other shows that start production in the summer, the lead time varies during the season, as many as fifteen weeks to as little as one day. The audience is entertained by the announcer before taping begins and in case of guests, the guest will answer questions from the audience. After the taping session, there is a drawing for a door prize. Since Carey took over as host, the show's schedule calls for 190 episodes (38 weeks) in daytime, from late September to Independence Day (July 4), and currently 12 episodes in primetime.\nOn some episodes, all members of the audience receive a prize from a sponsor or celebrity guest; those prizes are usually mentioned in the Showcase (such as a complimentary slice of Papa John's Pizza, an NHL Winter Classic game puck, a couples' gift box from Hershey's or a book authored by a guest). Television and Internet viewers have also been directed to the show's official website to enter a drawing for a similar prize offered to all viewers or another prize related to the special offer (such as the Rock of Ages signed CD). Some episodes are taped \"out-of-order\" so that a specific episode will air after other episodes have aired. Notably, the Christmas Week episodes are usually taped in early December outside of the regular rotation. An episode may be taped out-of-order if a prize package or episode theme reflects an event that is taking place close to the date that episode will air (primarily with CBS properties such as the NFL, and \"NCAA March Madness\"). Other episodes may be aired out of order because of game-related incidents or situations beyond the network's control. Most instances of episodes airing out of order occur when the show is taped far in advance or when a natural disaster recently occurred at a trip venue featured in an episode. A Season 53 episode recorded in June 2024 was broadcast 390 days later in July 2025. A Season 51 episode taped in December 2022 and scheduled to be broadcast in February 2023, was broadcast two months before into Season 52 in November 2023 because of numerous disasters to two trip venues.\nOn March 8, 2023, it was announced that \"The Price Is Right\" would relocate from Television City after season 51 due to the $1.25 billion refurbishment and expansion of the facility by its new owner Hackman Capital. The program will move to Haven Studios, a new facility in the Atwater Village neighborhood of Los Angeles. Sister program \"Let's Make a Deal\" will also move to Haven. Taping commenced in late July 2023 from the new studio. Barker died at age 99 on August 26, 2023, almost three months before the last episode ever to be filmed in his namesake studio had aired. On the next scheduled taping on August 28, 2023, segments for a tribute to Barker that aired on August 31, 2023, were filmed at Haven Studios on the new set, marking the first time portions of the new studio were seen on broadcast.\nOn January 8, 2025, it was announced that \"The Price Is Right\" would suspend production due to the wildfires in the Southern California region, where Haven Studios, the filming spot for the show, is located. Production resumed on January 13, 2025.\nSeason 49\u201351 changes.\nIn March 2020, production of \"The Price Is Right\" was suspended as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. On the September 16, 2020 episode of \"The Athletic\"'s \"Starkville\" podcast, Drew Carey informed the podcast that Fremantle intended to resume taping in October 2020 with only essential personnel, including 27 contestants for a given day (nine contestants per show, three shows a day) of taping in the studio. On October 5, 2020, \"Deadline Hollywood\" interviewed executive producer Evelyn Warfel about protocol changes for the show. Social media posts from announcer George Gray and model James O'Halloran confirmed that taping had resumed.\nSeason 49 episodes had a redesigned set with no audience, and Contestants' Row changed to use the wider setup when teams are used in order to promote social distancing. For season 50 and 51, the show brought back a limited audience of approximately 50 people seated in pods, similar to \"Let's Make a Deal\".\nHaven Studios changes.\nAt Television City, a full audience was about 300 people. The move to Glendale and the new studio, which was implemented in Season 52, led to audience capacity being reduced to 165. Taping days featuring either two or three episodes per day (8:00, 11:30, and 14:00). Episodes are filmed either Monday to Wednesday or Wednesday to Friday per week, but some weeks have featured four days of taping (9-12 episodes a week). Fremantle will do all contestant briefings and interviews at Charis Mission Church next door. The two CBS Daytime game shows alternated usage of the venue during the season.\nIn compliance with RTL Standards and Practices, producers prohibit audience members from attending multiple shows on the same date in order to prevent cheating, as the same prize from one episode may potentially be reused in another episode taped later in that day. Under this policy, one of the three episodes to be taped that day is designated a \"restricted\" taping, as it must feature an entirely new audience that did not attend another taping that day. In Season 52, the restricted taping was the late (14:00) taping, where those in the two morning sessions cannot attend the afternoon session. In early Season 53, which began taping in April 2024, the restricted taping is now the early morning session (8:00) where the audience of that session is not permitted to attend either the mid-morning or afternoon session. Currently, the On Camera Audiences Web site will inform prospective attendees which taping session is the prohibited taping.\nThe contract with RTL Group and Haven Studios, especially with the time to tape the two CBS Daytime game shows, caused officials to attempt in Season 53 with taping four episodes during January 2025, with shows at 6:30, 8:30, 12:00, and 14:15 (sessions would take no more than two hours). That was mostly abandoned because of the wildfires nearby that cancelled all but two days of tapings with the experimental format. Those weeks would have featured 12 episodes taped in a week over three days. Instead, when taping resumed after the wildfires were contained, between nine and 12 episodes are taped in a week, three episodes a day, in three or four days. This resulted in Friday episodes airing from March 7 to May 30 having all six pricing games played for cash, a concept first experimented during the Season 53 primetime premiere.\nPrizes.\nCompanies donate prizes in exchange for advertising. According to the CBC Radio One series \"Under the Influence\", each episode has a script about 30 pages long, consisting primarily of what is essentially advertising copy. The book \"Come On Down!: Behind the Big Doors at \"The Price Is Right\"\" by staffer Stan Blits says the prizes require acres of warehouse space to store. Since season 37 (2008), the program purchased certain prizes at outlet stores in an effort to diversify and upscale the prizes being offered on the show, in an effort to aim at younger demographics (such as college-age students, which has been noted as a popular demographic for the program).\nProduction company.\nThe version of the series that began in 1972 was originally \"A Mark Goodson\u2013Bill Todman Production\" in association with CBS. After Todman died in July 1979, the unit became known as simply Mark Goodson Productions and referred to as such on \"The Price Is Right\" from 1984 to June 2007. Today, the series is produced by Fremantle and copyrighted by The Price Is Right Productions, Inc., a joint venture of RTL Group and CBS. For the sake of tradition and through special permission from RTL's subsidiary Fremantle, the show continued to use the Mark Goodson Productions name, logo, and announcement at the end of each episode until Barker's retirement, even after Fremantle purchased and absorbed the Goodson-Todman holdings. The show was credited as a FremantleMedia production from 2007 to 2018; after the company's name change in 2018, it is now credited simply as a Fremantle production.\nBroadcast history.\n\"The Price Is Right\" premiered on September 4, 1972, at 10:30\u00a0a.m. ET (9:30\u00a0a.m. CT) on CBS, one of three game shows to debut that day, the other two being \"The Joker's Wild\" at 10:00\u00a0a.m. ET and \"Gambit\" at 11:00\u00a0a.m. ET. The show was first billed as \"The New Price Is Right\" to distinguish itself from the earlier/original version (1956\u201365) hosted by Bill Cullen, but it proved so popular in its own right that, in June 1973, Goodson-Todman decided to drop the word \"New\" from its title. On March 26, 1973, CBS moved \"The Price Is Right\" to 3:00\u00a0p.m. ET, pairing it with \"Match Game\" as part of what became the highest-rated pairing in daytime, it ran a close second to the NBC soap opera \"Another World\". The show remained in that time slot until August 11, 1975, when it permanently returned to the morning lineup at 10:30\u00a0a.m. ET. Over the next several years, \"Price\" would face a variety of game shows on NBC, then, as now, ABC did not program that timeslot, leaving its affiliates to do it themselves.\nDuring the week of September 8\u201312, 1975, \"The Price Is Right\" experimented with a sixty-minute episode format, during what it called \"Anniversary Week\" (the third anniversary of its premiere). The Anniversary Week included a prototypical circular Showcase Showdown spinner wheel used only for that week of shows. The Anniversary Week experiment was a ratings success, and quickly led to the announcement on September 30, 1975, of the permanent expansion of \"The Price Is Right\" to sixty minutes, effective November 3, 1975, its start time moved to 10:00\u00a0a.m. ET. From March 7, 1977, to November 4, 1977, \"The Price Is Right\" aired at 10:30\u00a0a.m. It then returned to 10:00\u00a0a.m. for just five weeks. On December 12, 1977, the show moved back to 10:30\u00a0a.m. and remained there until April 20, 1979, when it assumed the 11:00\u00a0a.m. ET slot where it has remained ever since.\nThe format of the show has since remained virtually unchanged. New pricing games are generally added each year, while others are retired. In addition, prizes and pricing games have kept pace with inflation, with games originally designed for four-digit prices of prizes (most often cars) adjusted to allow for five-digit prices, such as by providing the first digit of its price for free. While the set has seen numerous redesigns and upgrades over the years, the show has maintained a similar aesthetic element since its premiere in 1972.\nIn season 36, CBS began offering full episodes of the show available for free viewing on the network's website. The show also began broadcasting in high definition with \"The Price Is Right $1,000,000 Spectacular\" primetime specials (the normal daytime version continued to air in standard definition). The show made the full transition to HD broadcasts beginning with season 37. During the weeks of September 28, 2009, September 20, 2010, and October 4, 2010, two new episodes aired each weekday on CBS. In 2009, the additional episodes filled a gap between the cancellation of the daytime drama \"Guiding Light\" and the debut of \"Let's Make a Deal\". In 2010, the extra episodes aired between the cancellation of \"As the World Turns\" and the debut of \"The Talk\". The intervening week offered a second episode of \"Let's Make a Deal\". The 2009 second episode aired in the timeslot vacated by \"Guiding Light\" at 10:00\u00a0a.m. or 3:00\u00a0p.m. ET/PT, depending on the affiliate's choice. In 2010, the second episode aired in the former \"As the World Turns\" time slot, at 2:00\u00a0p.m. ET/PT. On December 5, 2024, it was announcedthat reruns of \"The Price is Right\" will temporarily fill in the timeslot of the recently cancelled afternoon daytime talk show \"The Talk\" (which was cancelled on December 16, 2024) until the new soap opera \"Beyond the Gates\" arrives on February 24, 2025. However, on January 27, 2025, \"Price\" reruns were eventually replaced by split repeats of the new CBS primetime \"Hollywood Squares\" that the network owns (unlike Price, owned by RTL Group) which Carey appears in selected episodes (both shows are part of the CBS primetime schedule between Survivor seasons) hosted by Nate Burleson until January 31, 2025.\nSyndicated productions.\nThree syndicated versions of \"The Price Is Right\" have aired. The first two followed the same format as the half-hour daytime version but were intended to air on most stations in the early evening in the pre-prime time slot, and as such, they were referred to by the announcer as \"the nighttime \"Price Is Right\".\"\n1972\u20131980.\nA weekly syndicated version debuted the week after the daytime premiere and continued to air until September 1980. It was distributed by Viacom Enterprises, which had started as the syndication arm of CBS. When Mark Goodson devised the revival of \"Price\" for the 1972\u201373 season, it was intended for a nighttime broadcast only under new rules for early-prime syndication, and Goodson named Dennis James to host the show. When CBS commissioned a new weekday daytime version, Goodson also wanted James to host that show, but CBS wanted Barker, who was still hosting the syndicated \"Truth or Consequences\" at the time, to take it. Barker preferred to host \"The Joker's Wild\", but CBS, again, insisted that he host \"Price\" instead.\nJames eventually hosted a taping day (four half-hour episodes) of the daytime show in December 1974 when Barker fell ill; those episodes were broadcast on and around Christmas Day. James did so concurrently with another daytime hosting gig, on the NBC version of \"Name That Tune\", another revived format from the 1950s.\nThe two versions were largely similar at the beginning, as both were called \"The New Price Is Right\". Some games had rule differences because of the larger budget and less commercial time on the nighttime show; for example, Double Prices was played for two prizes instead of one.\nThis version retained the 1972 half-hour format for its entire run and never adopted the daytime show's Double Showcase rule or the Showcase Showdown added to the daytime format when it expanded to an hour in 1975. The word \"New\" was dropped from the program's name starting in the second season, being titled simply \"The Price Is Right\" (as the daytime show was by this time as well) from that point onward, and was often referred to on the air by James and Olson as \"the nighttime \"Price Is Right\".\" In most of the U.S., stations carried the syndicated \"Price\" as one of other programs airing in the timeslot (7:30\u00a0p.m. ET) immediately before primetime which was created by the 1971 FCC Prime Time Access Rule.\nThough the nighttime version originally had higher ratings than the CBS daytime version, by 1975, the syndicated ratings started to drop. After the fifth nighttime season in 1977, when the contract with NBC's owned-and-operated stations ended, James's contract was not renewed. CBS's owned-and-operated stations picked the show up and the decision was made to hire Barker, to bring it in line with the daytime version. The series taped its 300th and final episode on March 12, 1980, and was cancelled after weekly syndicated game shows had fallen out of popularity in favor of daily offerings (such as \"Family Feud\", which had expanded to daily syndication the same year \"The Nighttime Price Is Right\" ended). With a run of eight seasons, it was one of the longest-running weekly syndicated game shows of the era and the longest-running regularly scheduled primetime version of \"Price\" (the 1957\u20131964 version aired seven seasons).\n1985\u201386.\nFive years later, veteran host Tom Kennedy starred in a new daily syndicated version, which also used the traditional half-hour format and was syndicated by The Television Program Source. Like the previous syndicated series, this version had a slightly larger budget than its daytime counterpart. A perfect bid during the One-Bids originally won that contestant a $100 bonus (like the daytime show did then), but was later increased to $500. This increased bonus permanently carried over to the daytime show in 1998.\nJanice Pennington, Holly Hallstrom, and Dian Parkinson all reprised their roles for this series, as did Johnny Olson until his death. Unlike the daytime series, the syndicated series did not employ guest announcers after Olson died and instead named Gene Wood as his replacement. Wood, in turn, was replaced by Rod Roddy shortly after he was named as Olson's successor on the daytime series.\nLike its predecessor, this syndicated edition of \"Price\" was intended to be aired in the Prime Time Access slots on local stations. However, unlike the 1970s, local stations found themselves bombarded with game shows and other series looking for spots on stations in an increasingly crowded market. It often resulted in shows like \"Price\" airing anywhere that they could be fit into a station's programming lineup, such as in the early-morning period or in late-night slots. As a consequence, the show was not able to find its intended audience and the ratings reports reflected that trouble.\n\"Price\" was no exception, as many of the stations who bought the series placed it in those less desirable slots and the show could not find a foothold against the popular shows of the day, such as the runaway success of the syndicated \"Wheel of Fortune\". Compared to some of the other shows on the market during this period, \"Price\" was a modest success, but it did not meet the very high expectations stations and Mark Goodson had for the series. As a result, the show was not renewed beyond its first season. A total of 170 episodes were produced, and they aired in first run from September 9, 1985, to May 30, 1986. During the six years it held the rights to \"Price\", the Kennedy version is the only one of the three syndicated versions that was rerun by GSN.\n\"The New Price Is Right\".\nEight years after the cancellation of Kennedy's \"Price Is Right\", a new syndicated version premiered on September 12, 1994, hosted by Doug Davidson (of \"The Young and the Restless\" fame) and distributed by Paramount Domestic Television. This series featured several significant changes: eliminating Contestants' Row, a different format for the Showcase Showdown, a Showcase featuring only one contestant, a completely different set, and a much larger budget (even when compared to the two previous syndicated runs) that gave contestants the potential to win up to five times what they could win on the daytime show. However, this version had even more trouble finding an audience than the 1985\u201386 series did and ended its run on January 27, 1995, after only 16 weeks of first-run shows. Several stylistic elements of this series, as well as many of its music cues, were later integrated into both the daytime version and nighttime specials.\nCBS primetime specials and series.\n1986\u20131996.\nCBS attempted to break NBC's dominance of Thursday night prime time by \"The Cosby Show\" and \"Family Ties\" with a six-episode summer series, \"The Price Is Right Special\", beginning in August 1986 that could be produced at a lower cost and promote the daytime game show. While it did not do its intended idea, it was the first of numerous primetime series for the game show. On August 23, 1996, CBS aired an hour-long 25th Anniversary Special, using the half-hour gameplay format and featuring a number of retrospective clips. The 30th Anniversary Special was recorded at Harrah's Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas and aired on January 31, 2002. This one-time road trip enticed 5,000 potential contestants to line up for 900 available tickets, causing an incident that left one person injured. \nThe Price Is Right Salutes.\nA second six-episode primetime series saluting various branches of the United States armed forces, police officers, and firefighters aired during the summer of 2002, as a tribute to the heroes of the September 11 attacks. During the series \"The Price Is Right Salutes\", spinning $1.00 in a bonus spin during the Showcase Showdown was worth $100,000 instead of the usual $10,000.\nThe primetime episode production codes since 2002 begins with \"Salutes\" (#001SP to #006SP); all primetime episodes since then are legally continuations of these episodes.\n2003\u201308: $1,000,000 Spectacular.\nThe success of the primetime series, which aired mostly in the summer, along with the vogue of big-money game shows, led to CBS launching another primetime series in 2003 that ran until 2008, titled \"The Price Is Right $1,000,000 Spectacular\". The 2007\u201308 Writers Guild of America strike and original success in the Nielsen ratings led CBS to commission ten more episodes of the primetime series. This series introduced set changes as the show was broadcast in high definition television for the first time and the set used for these episodes (except for the black floor) was moved to the daytime show in 2008. On the primetime series, larger and more expensive prizes were generally offered than on the daytime show. The Showcase frequently offered multiple or very expensive cars. In the first sixteen \"$1,000,000 Spectaculars\", all hosted by Barker, the payoff for landing on the $1.00 during a bonus spin in the Showcase Showdown was increased to $1 million.\nThe rules for the $1 million bonus spin were later revised to offer the winner of the Showcase a spin if no other contestant had received a bonus spin in either Showcase Showdown. If both contestants overbid, an audience member was chosen at random to spin the wheel. This rule was again changed so that in the event of a double overbid, the contestant who overbid by the least received the bonus spin for a chance at $1 million.\nThe million-dollar spin was eliminated in 2008, and instead, contestants were given two ways to win the top prize. One pricing game per episode was selected as a \"million-dollar game\", with a secondary objective needing to be met in order for the contestant to win the money. Contestants were also awarded the million-dollar bonus if they managed to win both Showcases, and the range the players had to come within was initially increased to $1,000, then reduced to $500. This format lasted one season (2008), which was made as replacement programming for the 2007-08 Writers Guild of America strike.\nThe Price Is Right at Night.\nIn 2016, \"The Price Is Right\" returned to primetime featuring cast members of CBS programs and hosts of CBS reality show franchises, including \"The Amazing Race\", \"Big Brother\", and \"Survivor\". The episodes featured fans of the three programs playing alongside past participants from them. In 2019, a retitled version called \"The Price Is Right at Night\" featured episodes with cast members from \"SEAL Team\" and others with Seth Rogen. Celebrities are paired with civilian contestants competing to win prizes. If there is a celebrity involved, episodes feature charitable donations toward a cause championed by the celebrity guest, with the celebrity joining the civilian contestants during the program. These shows feature a cash equivalent to all prizes won that episode in pricing games donated to the celebrity's charity, and during the second Showcase Showdown, making one spin of the Showcase Showdown wheel, with the value multiplied by 10,000 to be donated to the celebrity's charity. After the shortened season caused by a six and a half month suspension of production caused by pandemic related shutdowns, Season 49 premiered in October 2020 as a primetime episode, and that season also featured a salute to essential workers in light of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, and the cast of \"The Neighborhood\" playing as themselves for charity in primetime. The first three episodes of Season 49 were actually primetime episodes that aired weekly before the first daytime episode aired November 16. \nAn August 2021 announcement detailed a two-hour primetime special \"The Price Is Right\" to air on September 30, 2021, in honor of its 50th season. The special featured a retrospective of memorable moments and outtakes from the show's history.\nAs a result of the labor stoppages with the SAG-AFTRA and Writers Guild of America, CBS announced on July 17, 2023 new episodes of \"The Price Is Right at Night\" during the 2023\u201324 primetime season to add to what is normally scheduled during the season between new seasons of \"Survivor\". The first batch of episodes aired in October 2023, with \"Let's Make a Deal Primetime\" airing in November. The first five primetime episodes of season 52 aired on October 2, 9, 13, 20, and 23. On October 18, 2023, the second set of five episodes were announced, featuring Christmas-themed episodes airing in the first week of December (December 4\u20135 and 7\u20138, skipping Wednesday because of Survivor and The Amazing Race), and one episode the Monday before Christmas on December 18. The Christmas Week episodes include Office Holiday Party, College Students, Blind Holidate, Holiday Heroes, with the fifth episode being a family-themed episode. A total of 21 episodes were taped in the season, one shy of a normal television primetime season. As such, the series aired seven episodes in \"Survivors time slot, commencing with Jackpot January each Wednesday from January 3 to February 21 until the start of \"Survivor\" series 46, with additional Jackpot episode on February 2 (a Friday) and except for February 7. Jackpot January\"' added new twists to classic pricing games, with the introduction of a six-digit 3 Strikes using five-digit rules to allow duplication of the first digit, Bullseye played for cash where a player plays with all five grocery products for a doubling cash jackpot each time the contestant makes a correct guess, Money Game where players played for \"both\" a car and boat, and a playing of Any Number where the cash in the piggy bank was made larger than the traditional car prize. \nThe February 7 episode was not Jackpot January, but instead the show's quadrennial Super Bowl themed episode featuring Jason and Travis Kelce remotely introducing their mother Donna Kelce, who presented a Showcase, and the episode's signature prize package of a Super Bowl tickets and travel to the event. The episode was taped January 3, 2024, before the end of the NFL regular season, before Travis Kelce (KC) would play in the game. Starting in 2009-10 season (the first since Carey took over the show in 2007), the show, in association with CBS Sports, features a Super Bowl-themed episode in years CBS carries the game, except in 2020-21 season because of pandemic restrictions where the Super Bowl travel and tickets trip could not be offered. Originally done every three years, starting with the 2023-24 NFL season, the first under new media deals, each of the four major broadcast networks carry the game on a four-year rotation. The next Super Bowl episode is scheduled for the 2027\u201328 season.\nOn August 31, 2023, at 8:00\u00a0p.m. ET, CBS aired a special one-hour program called \"The Price Is Right: A Tribute to Bob Barker\" with Carey serving as host. The program was a tribute to the life and career of longtime host Bob Barker, who died from Alzheimer's disease the previous Saturday morning at age 99. The program featured Carey introducing several segments highlighting the greatest moments of Barker's career, including being introduced as host of \"Truth or Consequences\" in 1956 and the originally named \"The New Price Is Right\" in 1972 as well as the famous movie \"brawl\" with Adam Sandler in \"Happy Gilmore\" all the way to his final three guest appearances after his retirement. It also focused on Barker's advocacy for animal rights and spaying and neutering pets. As of September 2023, this is the only episode to not feature any gameplay, studio audience or other members from the show's cast (including announcer George Gray and the models). Season 52 tapings had commenced in late July 2023, a full month prior to Barker's death, and the special was filmed after a scheduled Season 52 taping day, becoming the first Price-related programming to air from the new studio. Reruns of the program aired on September 4, 2023 (the show's anniversary), and December 12, 2023 (the latter of which would have been Bob Barker's 100th birthday), in the show's customary 11:00\u00a0a.m. ET time slot.\nSeason 53 premiered with both a daytime and primetime episode on the same day, and with the reduction in episodes for most scripted television shows, the first three weeks of the season started with Monday primetime episodes, each with themes where all six pricing games are played for the same type of prize (cash in the first week, cars in the second week, and trips in the third). Most primetime episodes were broadcast on Wednesdays from December to February between \"Survivor\" 47 and 48, and additional episodes to be broadcast in May after \"Survivor\" concludes. The Jackpot January format will be used for the winter episodes. On the December 24, 2024, episode (\"Holiday Heroes\"), Check-Out featured a $20,000 bonus prize if a player could guess exactly the price of any of the five products in the pricing game.\nThe schedule for Season 54 will remain the same with a primetime season premiere, Jackpot January, and May episodes. The official 100th Episode of the primetime series since May 2002 (since the at Night episode counts begin with the May 2002 military tributes) is also expected in Season 54. (The 1986 series and 2002 Las Vegas episodes do not count in the official production codes.)\nOn November 28, 2025, it was announced that the sixth season of \"The Price is Right at Night\" is expected to premiere on January 7, 2026.\nGameshow Marathon.\nOn May 31, 2006, \"The Price Is Right\" was featured on the series \"Gameshow Marathon\", one of seven classic game shows hosted by talk show host and actress Ricki Lake and was announced by \"Price\"'s then-announcer Rich Fields. This version combined aspects of the Barker and Davidson versions with the celebrity contestants playing three pricing games, followed by a Showcase Showdown where the \"two\" contestants with the highest scores moved on to the Showcase. The winner of the Showcase also earned a spot in Finalists' Row. Fields was the announcer for this version which was taped in Studio 46. It also marked the first \"Price Is Right\" episode directed by DiPirro, who replaced Eskander as the director on the daytime show in January 2009.\nReruns.\nGame Show Network was the first cable channel to carry reruns of the show from December 9, 1996, to April 3, 2000. These reruns mostly consisted of episodes from the early 1980\u2019s along with selected episodes from the show\u2019s first ten seasons, episodes from season 15 (1986\u201387) and season 20 (1991\u201392), and the 1985\u201386 syndicated episodes with Tom Kennedy as host. Episodes from before September 1982 (season 11) had to be screened beforehand to eliminate episodes with fur coat prizes at Barker\u2019s request, a factor that delayed the show from joining the channel two years after its launch.\nParamount-owned Pluto TV and Fremantle-owned Buzzr announced on November 30, 2020, that a new 24-hour channel named \"The Price Is Right: The Barker Era\" would be added to the Pluto TV lineup starting on December 1, 2020. The channel includes episodes of \"The Price Is Right\" from the 1980s hosted by Barker, with some episodes airing for the first time since their original air dates. As part of the launch, a selection of holiday-themed episodes from the era aired on Christmas Eve 2020. The channel was added to The Roku Channel on February 8, 2022. Episodes from the 1972\u201373 season were added into the rotation in November 2023.\nOn June 1, 2023, Pluto TV launched another \"Price\" channel, which includes episodes from the late 2000s and early 2010s hosted by Carey.\nFremantle had an exclusivity agreement with Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS and Pluto TV, giving Paramount the rights to all episodes of \"The Price Is Right\" from 1972 onward, for this reason, Fremantle could not air \"Price\" reruns on Buzzr's over-the-air affiliates, nor could they license out the show to other networks. On May 28, 2024, this exclusivity agreement was lifted, allowing Buzzr to carry \"The Price Is Right\" reruns from the Barker era on Buzzr, with episodes culled from the same pool of 1980s episodes as the Pluto TV channel. Buzzr would add further episodes from season 17, featuring Roddy as announcer and a gray-haired Barker, in September 2025.\nIn Canada, beginning in September 2023, Canadian network GameTV began airing episodes from the 1982\u201383 season, culled from the same pool that aired on Pluto TV channel. In September of 2024, the network began airing the half-hour episodes from the 1972\u201373 season.\nScientific research.\nThe show has attracted attention from economists, who analyze different elements as a natural experiment on strategic decision making.\nSeveral papers focus on the One Bid game. Jonathan Berk and others show that a rational bidder should cut off an existing bid by bidding $1 above it. Pavel Atanasov and coauthors show that fourth bidders are more likely to cut off opposite-gender opponents than members of their own gender.\nStudies of the Showcase Showdown test the game-theoretic notion of subgame perfect equilibrium. In game-theoretic terms, The Showcase Showdown is a sequential game of perfect information for which the equilibrium can be found through backward induction. Several papers have solved the optimal strategy for particular spin outcomes. Rafael Tenorio and Timothy N. Cason studied a set of episodes from 1994 and 1995 and found evidence that players under-spin compared to the equilibrium prediction. Recently, a team of economists analyzed 40 years of data and found the same pattern of under-spinning, but only for the contestant who spins first. They found these mistakes are well explained by limited foresight; a sizeable fraction of contestants appear to myopically consider the next stage of the game. In line with learning, the researchers found the quality of contestants' choices improves over time.\nReality web show spinoffs.\n\"Road to Price\".\n\"Road to Price\" is a six episode reality documentary show aired on the now-defunct \"CBS Innertube\" from September 20, 2006, to September 27, 2006. The program featured nine teenage boys driving to Los Angeles in a refurbished mini-school bus as they leave their hometown of Merrimack, New Hampshire in order to be on \"The Price Is Right\". The episode of \"The Price Is Right\" featuring the cast aired September 27, 2006.\n\"The Price Is Right Male Model Search\".\nFive episodes aired on their official website \"priceisright.com\" along with its YouTube page from October 27, 2014, to November 11, 2014. The series was created in order to replace the first male \"Price\" model Rob Wilson as he pursued an acting career in the online version of the ABC daytime soap opera \"All My Children\". During the webisode series, hopeful contestants attempt to be selected as the next male model. Judges included Wilson, Mike Richards, Manuela Arbel\u00e1ez, Amber Lancaster, Gwendolyn Osborne-Smith, Rachel Reynolds, and former Miss America Shanna Moakler. The three finalists appeared on the CBS daytime talk show \"The Talk\". Online voting determined the winner, and James O'Halloran became the newest cast member. He first appeared on the episode which aired on December 15, 2014. He has since been joined by a third male model, former NFL player Devin Goda, who joined the show during season 47.\nPrizes.\nAs of November 2009, the show had given away approximately $250 million in cash and prizes. Furs have not been offered as prizes since Barker's tenure as host (although wool and leather are now permitted). Several Barker-imposed prohibitions have been lifted since his departure, such as offering products made of leather or leather seats in vehicles and showing simulated meat props on barbecues and in ovens. The show has also offered couture clothing and accessories, featuring designers such as Coach Inc., Louis Vuitton, and Limited Brands in an attempt to attract a younger demographic, as well as backyard play equipment such as JumpSport Trampolines and electronics such as smartphones, personal computer systems, video game systems and entertainment centers. Other prizes which have frequently appeared on the show since its beginnings include automobiles, furniture, trips and cash. The most expensive prize offered on this version of the show was a Ferrari 458 Italia Spider sports car, priced at $285,716, that appeared on the April 25, 2013, episode during \"Big Money Week.\" The prize was offered during the 3 Strikes pricing game. Prior to this, the most expensive prize was a Tesla Roadster (2008) (valued at $112,845), featured on the April 22, 2010, episode in the pricing game Golden Road.\nSince Carey took over as host, prizes from Ohio-based companies or companies with major Ohio operations have appeared, as Ohio is the home state of Carey and former announcer Fields. They have included Honda (see below), as well as Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams, which is based in Columbus, Ohio and got its start in Columbus's historic North Market.\nAutomobiles.\nSince the show's debut, automobiles have been a signature prize on \"The Price Is Right\". Most hour-long episodes have two pricing games that are each played for an automobile and in most episodes (although not all), at least one showcase will include an automobile. For special episodes, such as the 5,000th episode, there will often be more cars offered.\nFrom 1991 to 2008, almost all automobiles offered on the show were made by companies based in the United States, specifically Detroit's Big Three (although cars made by these companies' foreign subsidiaries or in a joint-venture with a foreign company were also offered during this era, in all cases badged under an American nameplate). The move was made by Barker, in his capacity as executive producer, as a sign of patriotism during the first Iraq war in 1991 and as a show of support to the American car industry, which was particularly struggling at that time. When Chrysler merged with German automaker Daimler-Benz in 1998 to form Daimler Chrysler AG (now simply Daimler AG after Chrysler split from the automaker, Chrysler later merged with Italian automaker Fiat to form Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and following another merger with French automaker PSA Group to form the Dutch-based Stellantis), the foreign ownership of Chrysler did not affect carrying any Chrysler-related models.\nSince Barker's retirement, cars made by foreign companies have been offered, most notably Honda, which has several factories throughout Ohio. Through product placement, certain episodes in 2008 and 2009 featured Honda as the exclusive automobile manufacturer for vehicles offered on that episode. The major European (Volkswagen, BMW, Daimler, Fiat, Polestar, and Volvo) and Asian (Hyundai-Kia, Toyota, Mitsubishi, Mazda, Nissan, Honda, and VinFast) manufacturers have all provided cars on the show since the ban was lifted, with premium foreign cars almost exclusively used for games that generally offer higher-priced cars, such as Golden Road and 3 Strikes. Starting around 2010, vintage and classic cars have occasionally been offered as prizes for games that do not involve pricing them. Among them have been a 1955 Chevrolet Bel Air and a 1964 Bentley S3. These cars are usually offered in games where their prices are irrelevant to gameplay, such as Hole in One and Bonus Game.\nVacation trips.\nTrips were also featured many times on the show as awards. These included both domestic trips across the United States and international trips. Usually, the trips were sponsored by hotel companies and, sometimes, by airlines as well. One frequent trip sponsor during the 1980s was American airline company Western Airlines.\nWinnings records.\nThe record for the largest individual total in cash and prizes on a daytime episode is held by Michael Strouber. On the October 14, 2019 episode, which aired during Big Money Week, Strouber won $202,000 (one $200,000 chip, one zero, and two $1,000 chips) in cash during a playing of Plinko. During the episode, game rules were modified to offer a top prize of $1,000,000, with each chip worth up to $200,000. Strouber walked away with $262,743 in cash and prizes, including a new car, a diamond tennis bracelet and a trip to Fiji.\nThe record for winnings on the primetime show is currently held by Adam Rose. On February 22, 2008, the first \"The Price Is Right $1,000,000 Spectacular\" episode since Carey became host, Rose won $20,000 playing Grand Game. By being within $1,000 of the actual retail price of his own showcases, he won both showcases\u2014which included a Cadillac XLR convertible in his showcase and a Ford Escape Hybrid in his opponent's\u2014plus a $1 million bonus. Rose's total is also the record for winnings on any version of the \"Price\" franchise worldwide, shattering the previous mark set by Joanne Segeviano on the Australian version in 2005.\nTerry Kniess holds the record for the closest bid on a showcase without going over, guessing the exact price of the showcase he was given. Kniess, an avid viewer of the show, recorded and watched every episode for four months prior to when he and his wife had tickets to attend in September 2008. Kniess learned that many prizes were repeatedly used (always at the same price) and began taking notes. Kniess was selected as a contestant on September 22, 2008, lost his pricing game (the only contestant to do so that episode), made it to the final showcase and guessed the exact amount of $23,743 for his showcase. Many show staffers, including Carey, were worried that the show was rigged and that Kniess was cheating. Kniess later explained that he had seen all three items of the showcase before and knew the general prices in the thousands. The 743 he used because it was his PIN, based on his wedding date and his wife's birth month. Kniess' winnings from the show totalled $56,437.\nCarey attributed his subdued reaction to the perfect bid by saying, \"Everybody thought someone had cheated. We'd just fired Roger Dobkowitz, and all the fan groups were upset about it. I remember asking, 'Are we ever going to air this?' And nobody could see how we could. So I thought the show was never going to air. I thought somebody had cheated us, and I thought the whole show was over. I thought they were going to shut us down, and I thought I was going to be out of a job.\" Kniess later defended his actions, claiming that he never cheated, and in the end, was awarded his prizes. (His feat can be comparable to the actions of Michael Larson, who appeared on the 1980s CBS game show \"Press Your Luck\", and won $110,237 by memorizing the board sequence).\nTwo are tied for second with the next closest bid, $1, and it happened in 1980 &amp; 2024.\nReception.\nCritical reaction.\n\"The Price Is Right\" has generally been praised and remained a stalwart in television ratings over its long history. In a 2007 article, \"TV Guide\" named the program the \"greatest game show of all time.\" The introduction of the program ushered in a new era of game shows\u2014moving away from the knowledge-based quiz show format, creating \"a noisy, carnival atmosphere that challenged cultural norms and assumptions represented in previous generations of quiz shows.\"\nThe show's early reception was not as universally positive, as critics lamented the show's stark departure from the highbrow norms of the Golden Age of Television; original nighttime host Dennis James admitted that even his own housekeeper did not watch the show for that reason, but also defended the series, saying \"CBS, who never wanted game shows, just put three game shows on the air, so they know they had better join the fight or lose out, because game shows have a tremendous appeal. The critics will always look down their noses, but you can't have \"The Bell Telephone Hour\" on and still stay in competition. If you want to read books, read books.\"\nLawsuits.\nSince the mid-1990s, the program production company and in some cases the executive producer (both Bob Barker and Mike Richards, the executive producer from 2009 to 2019) have been sued by numerous women. Most of the lawsuits involved models and other staff members in cases of sexual harassment, wrongful termination and racial discrimination. Allegations of sexual harassment brought by Dian Parkinson led to Barker calling a press conference to admit a past consensual sexual relationship with her, while denying any harassment, explaining that she was only angry with him for calling off the relationship. Barker was widowed in 1981 following the death of his wife, Dorothy Jo, but was in a separate long-term relationship with Nancy Burnet (one that would continue until his death) during his affair with Parkinson. It has also been alleged that Barker and senior staff created a hostile work environment, particularly to those who testified for the plaintiffs suing Barker. Responding to the controversy just before his retirement, Barker told William Keck of \"USA Today\", \"They have been such a problem. I don't want to say anything about them. They [were] disgusting, I don't want to mention them.\" The Barker-era lawsuits, except for one, were settled out of court. After Barker dropped his slander suit against Hallstrom, she eventually countersued and received millions in settlement. Former model Lanisha Cole filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against the show's producers in 2011; it was settled in 2013.\nThe lawsuits for \"Price\" affected the popular syndicated game show \"Jeopardy!\", as Mike Richards (who had been named host of the show before resigning in the span of nine days) was executive producer for \"Price\" from 2008 to 2019.\nMerchandise.\n\"The Price Is Right\" has expanded beyond television to home and live stage shows, and casino-based games.\nDVD release.\nA four-disc DVD box set, titled \"The Best of \"The Price Is Right,\u201d\" was released on March 25, 2008. The set features four episodes of the 1956\u20131965 Bill Cullen series, 17 episodes of the Barker 1972\u20131975 daytime series and the final five daytime episodes hosted by Barker. In accordance with Barker's animal-rights wishes, which remain in effect beyond his retirement, any episodes with fur coats as prizes cannot be aired or released onto home media formats. This includes the first three daytime shows recorded in 1972, plus most of the 1970s syndicated run.\nBoard games.\nSeven board games have been produced. One of them was a variation of a card game, using prizes and price tags from the 1956 version. The second was based more closely on the original version of the show.\nThree games were produced during the 1970s by Milton Bradley, with Contestants' Row, some pricing games, and, in the case of the third version, a spinner for the Big Wheel. In the first two versions, decks of cards had various grocery items, small prizes, and larger prizes. The third version simply had cards for each game that included ten sets of \"right\" answers, all using the same price choices. The instruction book specified what color cards were necessary for each round.\nThe 1986 version, again by Milton Bradley, was similar in scope to the earlier version, with new prizes and more games, but lacking the Big Wheel. The instruction book refers to Contestants' Row as the \"Qualifying Round\" and the pricing games as \"Solo Games.\" The book also instructs players to use items priced under $100 as One Bids. The 1998 version of the game, by Endless Games, was virtually identical to the 1986 release, with the same games, prizes, and even the same prices. The only changes were that the number tiles were made of cardboard bits instead of plastic and the cars from the deck of prizes with four-digit prices were removed.\nThe 2004 version, again by Endless Games, was a complete departure from previous home versions. Instead of different prize cards and games, the game consisted of everything needed to play 45 games and enough materials to create all the games not technically included if the \"host\" wished to and knew their rules. The Big Wheel spinner was also restored, this time with the numbers in the correct order. Additionally, the prices, instead of being random numbers that could change each time the game was played, were actual prices taken from episodes of the TV show. To fit everything in the box, grocery items and prizes were listed in the instruction book and games were played on dry erase boards. A spinner determined the game to be played next, although its use was not necessarily required if the \"host\" wished to build his own game lineup, or even use a pricing game not included in the lineup.\nComputer and electronic games.\nIn 1990, GameTek created a \"Price Is Right\" video game for MS-DOS, Commodore 64, and other. A handheld Tiger game was made in 1998 with four pricing games. A DVD game with 12 pricing games, live casino show host Todd Newton and video of prizes taken directly from the show was produced by Endless Games in 2005. A 2008 DVD edition, also from Endless Games, featured many changes based on season 36 and included seven new games: Half Off, More or Less, Swap Meet, Secret X, That's Too Much, Coming or Going, and Hole in One. It also featured both host Drew Carey and announcer Rich Fields. CBS.com featured an online \"Price Is Right\"-based game in the late 1990s, which was plugged in the closing credits of each episode. The game consisted of choosing which of the four bidders in Contestant's Row was closest to the price of a prize without going over. Additionally, Mobliss provides a suite of pricing games for cellular phones.\nOn March 26, 2008, Ludia (in connection with Ubisoft) launched \"The Price Is Right\" video game for Windows. A version for the Wii and Nintendo DS was released in September 2008. A version for the iOS was released in November 2008. The show's then-current announcer, Rich Fields, was the host of the computer version. The virtual set in the game resembled the set used in Seasons 31 to 34. Ludia announced that all three platforms will receive a new version of the video game that was previewed at the Target Bullseye Lounge during the Electronic Entertainment Expo trade show on June 2\u20134, 2009. \"The Price Is Right 2010 Edition\" was released on September 22, 2009. In the fall of 2010, Ludia developed a multi-player version for Facebook. A third Ludia adaptation, \"The Price Is Right Decades\", featuring set designs, pricing games and prizes taken from the 1970s through 2000s, was initially released for the Wii in October 2011, with an Xbox 360 and iOS release following in November and December. \"The Price Is Right 2010 Edition\" and \"The Price Is Right Decades\" have also been released as downloads within the PlayStation Store for the PlayStation 3 in May 2010 and April 2012, respectively. Irwin Toys released an electronic tabletop version in 2008 featuring Contestant's Row, the Big Wheel, a physical Plinko board with chips, Showcases and seven pricing games. Jakks Pacific released a Plug It in and Play version of \"The Price Is Right\" in 2009, featuring Carey and Fields.\nSlot machines.\nA series of video slot machines were manufactured for North American casinos by International Game Technology. Although gameplay varies by machine, each features themes and motifs from the show, including the Showcase Showdown, with themes used following Carey's start as host. Others feature pricing games as gameplay elements, including Plinko, Cliff Hangers, Punch a Bunch, Dice Game, and Money Game.\nScratch-off tickets.\nA scratchcard version of the game is being offered by several U.S. and Canadian state/provincial lotteries, featuring adaptations of Plinko, Cliff Hangers, the Showcase Showdown and the Showcase. The top prize varies with each version.\n\"Live\" casino game.\nAfter the 30th anniversary episode taped in Las Vegas in 2002, Harrah's and RTL Group began producing live licensed shows (dubbed \"The Price Is Right Live!\") at their venues, with several performers, including Roger Lodge, Marc Summers (who was one of the finalists to replace Barker), Newton, and Gray hosting, with West, Rosen, and Dave Walls announcing.\n\"Come on Down Tour!\".\nIn 2022, the show launched a coast-to-coast tour of live events celebrating the show's 50th anniversary. Contestants had \"a chance to play Plinko, spin the wheel, and compete in a Showcase\" to win prizes, and had a chance to win an additional $50,000. The tour visited 50 locations and stopped in Los Angeles, Denver, Dallas, New Orleans, Nashville, St. Louis, Cleveland (the hometown of the show's current host Drew Carey) and New York. In October 2022, the tour returned as part of a special weekend event along with the celebration of Carey's 15th season as host sponsored by the Paley Center for Media called PaleyWKND. In addition, Drew Carey, George Gray, and Devin Goda were scheduled to be there in person.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Seitz was the 4th president of Rockefeller University from 1968 to 1978, and the 17th president of the National Academy of Sciences from 1962 to 1969. Seitz was the recipient of the National Medal of Science, NASA's Distinguished Public Service Award, and other honors.\nHe founded the Frederick Seitz Materials Research Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign and several other material research laboratories across the United States. Seitz was also the founding chairman of the George C. Marshall Institute.\nBackground and personal life.\nSeitz was born in San Francisco on July 4, 1911. His mother was also from San Francisco and his father, after whom he was named, was born in Germany. Seitz graduated from Lick-Wilmerding High School in the middle of his senior year, and went on to study physics at Stanford University obtaining his bachelor's degree in three years, graduating in 1932. He married Elizabeth K. Marshall on May 18, 1935.\nSeitz died March 2, 2008, in New York.\nHe was survived by a son, three grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.\nEarly career.\nSeitz moved to Princeton University to study metals under Eugene Wigner, gaining his PhD in 1934. He and Wigner pioneered one of the first quantum theories of crystals, and developed concepts in solid-state physics such as the Wigner\u2013Seitz unit cell used in the study of crystalline material in solid-state physics.\nAcademic career.\nAfter graduate studies, Seitz continued to work on solid state physics, publishing \"The Modern Theory of Solids\" in 1940, motivated by a desire to \"write a cohesive account of the various aspects of solid-state physics in order to give the field the kind of unity it deserved\". \"The Modern Theory of Solids\" helped unify and understand the relations between the fields of metallurgy, ceramics, and electronics. He was also a consultant on many World War II-related projects in metallurgy, radiation damage to solids and electronics amongst others. He, along with Hillard Huntington, made the first calculation of the energies of formation and migration of vacancies and interstitials in copper, inspiring many works on point defects in metals. The scope of his published work ranged widely, also covering \"spectroscopy, luminescence, plastic deformation, irradiation effects, physics of metals, self-diffusion, point defects in metals and insulators, and science policy\".\nEarly in his academic career, Seitz served on the faculty of the University of Rochester (1935\u201337) and after an interlude as a research physicist at General Electric Laboratories (1937\u201339) he was at the University of Pennsylvania (1939\u20131942) and then the Carnegie Institute of Technology (1942\u201349).\nFrom 1946 to 1947, Seitz was director of the training program in atomic energy at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. He was appointed professor of physics at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, in 1949, becoming chairman of the department in 1957 and dean and vice-president for research in 1964. Seitz also served as an advisor to NATO. From 1962 to 1969 Seitz served as president of the United States National Academy of Sciences (NAS), in a full-time capacity from 1965. As NAS president he initiated the Universities Research Association, which contracted with the Atomic Energy Commission to construct the world's largest particle accelerator at the time, Fermilab.\nHe was the president of Rockefeller University from 1968 to 1978 during which he helped to launch new research programs in molecular biology, cell biology, and neuroscience as well as creating a joint MD-PhD program with Cornell University. He retired from Rockefeller University in 1979, when he was made President Emeritus.\nConsultancy career.\nAfter Seitz published a paper on the darkening of crystals, DuPont asked him in 1939 for help with a problem they were having with the stability of chrome yellow. He became \"deeply involved\" in their research efforts. Among other things, he investigated the possible use of non-toxic silicon carbide as a white pigment. Seitz was a director of Texas Instruments (1971\u20131982) and of Akzona Corporation (1973\u20131982).\nShortly before his 1979 retirement from Rockefeller University, Seitz began working as a permanent consultant for the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, advising their medical research program until 1988. Reynolds had previously provided \"very generous\" support for biomedical work at Rockefeller. Seitz later wrote that \"The money was all spent on basic science, medical science,\" and pointed to Reynolds-funded research on mad cow disease and tuberculosis. Nonetheless, later academic studies of tobacco industry influence concluded that Seitz, who helped allocate $45m of Reynolds' research funding, \"played a key role... in helping the tobacco industry produce uncertainty concerning the health impacts of smoking.\" According to a tobacco industry memo from 1989, Seitz was described by an employee of Philip Morris International as \"quite elderly and not sufficiently rational to offer advice.\"\nIn 1984 Seitz was the founding chairman of the George C. Marshall Institute, and was its chairman until 2001. The Institute was founded to argue for President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, but \"in the 1990s it branched out to become one of the leading think tanks trying to debunk the science of climate change.\" A 1990 report co-authored with Institute co-founders Robert Jastrow and William Nierenberg \"centrally informed the Bush administration's position on human-induced climate change\". The Institute also promoted environmental skepticism more generally. In 1994, the Institute published a paper by Seitz titled \"Global warming and ozone hole controversies: A challenge to scientific judgment.\" Seitz questioned the view that CFCs \"are the greatest threat to the ozone layer\". In the same paper, commenting on the dangers of secondary inhalation of tobacco smoke, he concluded \"\"there is no good scientific evidence that passive inhalation is truly dangerous under normal circumstances.\"\nSeitz was a central figure amongst global warming deniers. He was the highest-ranking scientist among a band of doubters who, beginning in the early 1990s, resolutely disputed suggestions that global warming was serious threat. Seitz argued that the science behind global warming was inconclusive and \"certainly didn't warrant imposing mandatory limits on greenhouse-gas emissions\"\". In 2001 Seitz and Jastrow questioned whether global warming is anthropogenic.\nSeitz signed the 1995 Leipzig Declaration and, in an open letter inviting scientists to sign the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine's global warming petition, called for the United States to reject the Kyoto Protocol. The letter was accompanied by a 12-page article on climate change which followed a style and format nearly identical to that of a contribution to Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), a scientific journal, even including a date of publication (\"October 26\") and volume number (\"Vol. 13: 149\u2013164 1999\"), but was not actually a publication of the National Academy of Science (NAS). In response the United States National Academy of Sciences took what the \"New York Times\" called \"the extraordinary step of refuting the position of one [of] its former presidents.\" The NAS also made it clear that \"The petition does not reflect the conclusions of expert reports of the Academy.\"\nSeitz worked extensively with Fred Singer during his consultancy career for tobacco and oil corporations in matters of health and climate change, respectively.\nPublishing.\nSeitz wrote a range of scientific books in his field, including \"The Modern Theory of Solids\" (1940) and \"The Physics of Metals\" (1943). Later he co-authored books such as the \"Theory of Lattice Dynamics in the Harmonic Approximation\" (1971) and \"Solid State Physics\". The latter, begun in 1955, with David Turnbull, reached 60 volumes by 2008, with Seitz remaining an active editor until volume 38 in 1984. \"Solid State Physics\" continues to be published by Elsevier. After his retirement he co-authored a book on global warming, published via the George C. Marshall Institute he chaired. He published his autobiography in 1994. Other works included biographies of American physicist Francis Wheeler Loomis (1991) and Canadian inventor Reginald Fessenden (1999), a history of silicon, and a history of the US National Academy of Sciences (2007).\nCriticism.\nIn the early 1970s, Seitz became unpopular for his support of the Vietnam war, a position which most of his colleagues on the President's Science Advisory Committee did not share. In the late 1970s, Seitz also parted company with his scientific colleagues on questions of nuclear preparedness. Seitz was committed to \"a muscular military strengthened by the most technologically advanced weaponry\", while the scientific community generally supported arms limitations talks and treaties. Seitz was also ardently anti-communist and his support for aggressive weapons programs was a reflection of this.\nIn their book \"Merchants of Doubt\", science historians Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway state that Seitz and a group of other scientists fought the scientific evidence and spread confusion on many of the most important issues of the 20th and 21st centuries like harmfulness of tobacco smoke, acid rain, CFCs, pesticides and global warming. Seitz said that American science had become \"rigid\", and his colleagues had become closed-minded and dogmatic. According to Oreskes and Conway, Seitz used normal uncertainties of scientific evidence to spread doubt about the harmfulness of tobacco smoke.\nSeitz was also a principal organizer of the infamous Oregon Petition, where numerous signatories claimed that there was no evidence that greenhouse gases were responsible for global warming. Despite Seitz being a past President of the US National Academy of Sciences, the NAS issued a press release stating \"The petition project was a deliberate attempt to mislead scientists and to rally them in an attempt to undermine support for the Kyoto Protocol. The petition was not based on a review of the science of global climate change, nor were its signers experts in the field of climate science.\" Journalists subsequently found that the identities of the vast majority of signatories could not be verified, because the petition's organizers had no process for identity authentication. Further, the supposed scientific article that claimed to refute global warming (and which accompanied the petition) was in fact a non-peer reviewed article from\nthe \"Journal of the American Association of Physicians and Surgeons\", which was published by Arthur Robinson, the petition's co-organizer. This journal advocates scientifically discredited viewpoints such as claiming that there is no connection between the HIV virus and AIDS, and is not indexed in PubMed.\nOreskes and Conway were critical of Seitz's involvement in the tobacco industry. They stated that Seitz stood against the scientific consensus that smoking was dangerous to people's health, and helped to create confusion and doubt on this issue.\nAwards and recognition.\nSeitz was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1946. He was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1952, serving as its President from 1962 to 1969. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1962. He received the Franklin Medal (1965). In 1973 he was awarded the National Medal of Science \"for his contributions to the modern quantum theory of the solid state of matter.\" He also received the United States Department of Defense Distinguished Service Award; the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Distinguished Public Service Award; and the Compton Award, the highest honor of the American Institute of Physics. In addition to Rockefeller University, 31 universities in the US and abroad awarded Seitz honorary degrees. He was also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.\nSeitz served on a range of boards of charitable institutions, including (as chair) John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation (1976\u20131983) and Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation, and (as trustee) American Museum of Natural History (from 1975) and Institute of International Education. He was also a board member of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Other appointments to a range of national and international agencies included serving on the Defense Science Board and serving as chair of the US delegation to the United Nations Committee on Science and Technology. He also served on the board of trustees of Science Service, now known as Society for Science &amp; the Public, from 1971 to 1974.\nIn 1981, Seitz became a founding member of the World Cultural Council.\nPositions held.\n\"Academic\"\n\"Private sector\"\n This book is a translation of Nikolaus Riehl's book \"Zehn Jahre im goldenen K\u00e4fig (Ten Years in a Golden Cage)\" (Riederer-Verlag, 1988); but Seitz wrote a lengthy introduction. It contains 58 photographs.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.\nRules.\nThe universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square \"cells\", each of which is in one of two possible states, \"live\" or \"dead\" (or \"populated\" and \"unpopulated\", respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight \"neighbours\", which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:\nThe initial pattern constitutes the \"seed\" of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed, live or dead; births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a \"tick\". Each generation is a \"pure function\" of the preceding one. The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.\nOrigins.\nStanis\u0142aw Ulam, while working at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the 1940s, studied the growth of crystals, using a simple lattice network as his model. At the same time, John von Neumann, Ulam's colleague at Los Alamos, was working on the problem of self-replicating systems. Von Neumann's initial design was founded upon the notion of one robot building another robot. This design is known as the kinematic model. As he developed this design, von Neumann came to realize the great difficulty of building a self-replicating robot, and of the great cost in providing the robot with a \"sea of parts\" from which to build its replicant. Von Neumann wrote a paper entitled \"The general and logical theory of automata\" for the Hixon Symposium in 1948. Ulam was the one who suggested using a \"discrete\" system for creating a reductionist model of self-replication. Ulam and von Neumann created a method for calculating liquid motion in the late 1950s. The driving concept of the method was to consider a liquid as a group of discrete units and calculate the motion of each based on its neighbours' behaviours. Thus was born the first system of cellular automata. Like Ulam's lattice network, von Neumann's cellular automata are two-dimensional, with his self-replicator implemented algorithmically. The result was a universal copier and constructor working within a cellular automaton with a small neighbourhood (only those cells that touch are neighbours; for von Neumann's cellular automata, only orthogonal cells), and with 29 states per cell. Von Neumann gave an existence proof that a particular pattern would make endless copies of itself within the given cellular universe by designing a 200,000 cell configuration that could do so. This design is known as the tessellation model, and is called a von Neumann universal constructor.\nMotivated by questions in mathematical logic and in part by work on simulation games by Ulam, among others, John Conway began doing experiments in 1968 with a variety of different two-dimensional cellular automaton rules. Conway's initial goal was to define an interesting and unpredictable cellular automaton. According to Martin Gardner, Conway experimented with different rules, aiming for rules that would allow for patterns to \"apparently\" grow without limit, while keeping it difficult to \"prove\" that any given pattern would do so. Moreover, some \"simple initial patterns\" should \"grow and change for a considerable period of time\" before settling into a static configuration or a repeating loop. Conway later wrote that the basic motivation for Life was to create a \"universal\" cellular automaton.\nThe game made its first public appearance in the October 1970 issue of \"Scientific American\", in Martin Gardner's \"Mathematical Games\" column, which was based on personal conversations with Conway. Theoretically, the Game of Life has the power of a universal Turing machine: anything that can be computed algorithmically can be computed within the Game of Life. Gardner wrote, \"Because of Life's analogies with the rise, fall, and alterations of a society of living organisms, it belongs to a growing class of what are called 'simulation games' (games that resemble real-life processes).\"\nSince its publication, the Game of Life has attracted much interest because of the surprising ways in which the patterns can evolve. It provides an example of emergence and self-organization. A version of Life that incorporates random fluctuations has been used in physics to study phase transitions and nonequilibrium dynamics. The game can also serve as a didactic analogy, used to convey the somewhat counter-intuitive notion that design and organization can spontaneously emerge in the absence of a designer. For example, philosopher Daniel Dennett has used the analogy of the Game of Life \"universe\" extensively to illustrate the possible evolution of complex philosophical constructs, such as consciousness and free will, from the relatively simple set of deterministic physical laws which might govern our universe.\nThe popularity of the Game of Life was helped by its coming into being at the same time as increasingly inexpensive computer access. The game could be run for hours on these machines, which would otherwise have remained unused at night. In this respect, it foreshadowed the later popularity of computer-generated fractals. For many, the Game of Life was simply a programming challenge: a fun way to use otherwise wasted CPU cycles. For some, however, the Game of Life had more philosophical connotations. It developed a cult following through the 1970s and beyond; current developments have gone so far as to create theoretic emulations of computer systems within the confines of a Game of Life board.\nExamples of patterns.\nMany different types of patterns occur in the Game of Life, which are classified according to their behaviour. Common pattern types include: \"still lifes\", which do not change from one generation to the next; \"oscillators\", which return to their initial state after a finite number of generations; and \"spaceships\", which translate themselves across the grid.\nThe earliest interesting patterns in the Game of Life were discovered without the use of computers. The simplest still lifes and oscillators were discovered while tracking the fates of various small starting configurations using graph paper, blackboards, and physical game boards, such as those used in Go. During this early research, Conway discovered that the R-pentomino failed to stabilize in a small number of generations. In fact, it takes 1103 generations to stabilize, by which time it has a population of 116 and has generated six escaping gliders; these were the first spaceships ever discovered.\nFrequently occurring examples (in that they emerge frequently from a random starting configuration of cells) of the three aforementioned pattern types are shown below, with live cells shown in black and dead cells in white. \"Period\" refers to the number of ticks a pattern must iterate through before returning to its initial configuration.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe \"pulsar\" is the most common period-3 oscillator. The great majority of naturally occurring oscillators have a period of 2, like the blinker and the toad, but oscillators of all periods are known to exist, and oscillators of periods 4, 8, 14, 15, 30, and a few others have been seen to arise from random initial conditions. Patterns which evolve for long periods before stabilizing are called \"Methuselahs\", the first-discovered of which was the R-pentomino. \"Diehard\" is a pattern that disappears after 130 generations. Starting patterns of eight or more cells can be made to die after an arbitrarily long time. \"Acorn\" takes 5,206 generations to generate 633 cells, including 13 escaped gliders.\nConway originally conjectured that no pattern can grow indefinitely\u2014i.e. that for any initial configuration with a finite number of living cells, the population cannot grow beyond some finite upper limit. In the game's original appearance in \"Mathematical Games\", Conway offered a prize of fifty dollars () to the first person who could prove or disprove the conjecture before the end of 1970. The prize was won in November by a team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, led by Bill Gosper; the \"Gosper glider gun\" produces its first glider on the 15th generation, and another glider every 30th generation from then on. For many years, this glider gun was the smallest one known. In 2015, a gun called the \"Simkin glider gun\", which releases a glider every 120th generation, was discovered that has fewer live cells but which is spread out across a larger bounding box at its extremities.\nSmaller patterns were later found that also exhibit infinite growth. All three of the patterns shown below grow indefinitely. The first two create a single \"block-laying switch engine\": a configuration that leaves behind two-by-two still life blocks as it translates itself across the game's universe. The third configuration creates two such patterns. The first has only ten live cells, which has been proven to be minimal. The second fits in a five-by-five square, and the third is only one cell high.\nLater discoveries included other \"guns\", which are stationary, and which produce gliders or other spaceships; \"puffer trains\", which move along leaving behind a trail of debris; and \"rakes\", which move and emit spaceships. Gosper also constructed the first pattern with an asymptotically optimal quadratic growth rate, called a \"breeder\" or \"lobster\", which worked by leaving behind a trail of guns.\nIt is possible for gliders to interact with other objects in interesting ways. For example, if two gliders are shot at a block in a specific position, the block will move closer to the source of the gliders. If three gliders are shot in just the right way, the block will move farther away. This \"sliding block memory\" can be used to simulate a counter. It is possible to construct logic gates such as \"AND\", \"OR\", and \"NOT\" using gliders. It is possible to build a pattern that acts like a finite-state machine connected to two counters. This has the same computational power as a universal Turing machine, so the Game of Life is theoretically as powerful as any computer with unlimited memory and no time constraints; it is Turing complete. In fact, several different programmable computer architectures have been implemented in the Game of Life, including a pattern that simulates Tetris.\nOblique spaceships.\nUntil the 2010s, all known spaceships could only move orthogonally or diagonally. Spaceships which move neither orthogonally nor diagonally are commonly referred to as \"oblique spaceships\". On May 18, 2010, Andrew J. Wade announced the first oblique spaceship, dubbed \"Gemini\", that creates a copy of itself on (5,1) further while destroying its parent. This pattern replicates in 34 million generations, and uses an instruction tape made of gliders oscillating between two stable configurations made of Chapman\u2013Greene construction arms. These, in turn, create new copies of the pattern, and destroy the previous copy. In December 2015, diagonal versions of the Gemini were built.\nA more specific case is a \"knightship\", a spaceship that moves two squares left for every one square it moves down (like a knight in chess), whose existence had been predicted by Elwyn Berlekamp since 1982. The first elementary knightship, Sir Robin, was discovered in 2018 by Adam P. Goucher. This is the first new spaceship movement pattern for an elementary spaceship found in forty-eight years. \"Elementary\" means that it cannot be decomposed into smaller interacting patterns such as gliders and still lifes.\nSelf-replication.\nA pattern can contain a collection of guns that fire gliders in such a way as to construct new objects, including copies of the original pattern. A \"universal constructor\" can be built which contains a Turing complete computer, and which can build many types of complex objects, including more copies of itself. On November 23, 2013, Dave Greene built the first replicator in the Game of Life that creates a complete copy of itself, including the instruction tape. In October 2018, Adam P. Goucher finished his construction of the 0E0P metacell, a metacell capable of self-replication. This differed from previous metacells, such as the OTCA metapixel by Brice Due, which only worked with already constructed copies near them. The 0E0P metacell works by using construction arms to create copies that simulate the programmed rule. The actual simulation of the Game of Life or other Moore neighbourhood rules is done by simulating an equivalent rule using the von Neumann neighbourhood with more states. The name 0E0P is short for \"Zero Encoded by Zero Population\", which indicates that instead of a metacell being in an \"off\" state simulating empty space, the 0E0P metacell removes itself when the cell enters that state, leaving a blank space.\nUndecidability.\nMany patterns in the Game of Life eventually become a combination of still lifes, oscillators, and spaceships; other patterns may be called chaotic. A pattern may stay chaotic for a very long time until it eventually settles to such a combination.\nThe Game of Life is undecidable, which means that given an initial pattern and a later pattern, no algorithm exists that can tell whether the later pattern is ever going to appear. Given that the Game of Life is Turing-complete, this is a corollary of the halting problem: the problem of determining whether a given program will finish running or continue to run forever from an initial input.\nIteration.\nFrom most random initial patterns of living cells on the grid, observers will find the population constantly changing as the generations tick by. The patterns that emerge from the simple rules may be considered a form of mathematical beauty. Small isolated subpatterns with no initial symmetry tend to become symmetrical. Once this happens, the symmetry may increase in richness, but it cannot be lost unless a nearby subpattern comes close enough to disturb it. In a very few cases, the society eventually dies out, with all living cells vanishing, though this may not happen for a great many generations. Most initial patterns eventually burn out, producing either stable figures or patterns that oscillate forever between two or more states; many also produce one or more gliders or spaceships that travel indefinitely away from the initial location. Because of the nearest-neighbour based rules, no information can travel through the grid at a greater rate than one cell per unit time, so this velocity is said to be the cellular automaton speed of light and denoted \"c\".\nAlgorithms.\nEarly patterns with unknown futures, such as the R-pentomino, led computer programmers to write programs to track the evolution of patterns in the Game of Life. Most of the early algorithms were similar: they represented the patterns as two-dimensional arrays in computer memory. Typically, two arrays are used: one to hold the current generation, and one to calculate its successor. Often 0 and 1 represent dead and live cells, respectively. A nested for loop considers each element of the current array in turn, counting the live neighbours of each cell to decide whether the corresponding element of the successor array should be 0 or 1. The successor array is displayed. For the next iteration, the arrays may swap roles so that the successor array in the last iteration becomes the current array in the next iteration, or one may copy the values of the second array into the first array then update the second array from the first array again.\nA variety of minor enhancements to this basic scheme are possible, and there are many ways to save unnecessary computation. A cell that did not change at the last time step, and none of whose neighbours changed, is guaranteed not to change at the current time step as well, so a program that keeps track of which areas are active can save time by not updating inactive zones.\nTo avoid decisions and branches in the counting loop, the rules can be rearranged from an egocentric approach of the inner field regarding its neighbours to a scientific observer's viewpoint: if the sum of all nine fields in a given neighbourhood is three, the inner field state for the next generation will be life; if the all-field sum is four, the inner field retains its current state; and every other sum sets the inner field to death.\nTo save memory, the storage can be reduced to one array plus two line buffers. One line buffer is used to calculate the successor state for a line, then the second line buffer is used to calculate the successor state for the next line. The first buffer is then written to its line and freed to hold the successor state for the third line. If a toroidal array is used, a third buffer is needed so that the original state of the first line in the array can be saved until the last line is computed.\nIn principle, the Game of Life field is infinite, but computers have finite memory. This leads to problems when the active area encroaches on the border of the array. Programmers have used several strategies to address these problems. The simplest strategy is to assume that every cell outside the array is dead. This is easy to program but leads to inaccurate results when the active area crosses the boundary. A more sophisticated trick is to consider the left and right edges of the field to be stitched together, and the top and bottom edges also, yielding a toroidal array. The result is that active areas that move across a field edge reappear at the opposite edge. Inaccuracy can still result if the pattern grows too large, but there are no pathological edge effects. Techniques of dynamic storage allocation may also be used, creating ever-larger arrays to hold growing patterns. The Game of Life on a finite field is sometimes explicitly studied; some implementations, such as \"Golly\", support a choice of the standard infinite field, a field infinite only in one dimension, or a finite field, with a choice of topologies such as a cylinder, a torus, or a M\u00f6bius strip.\nAlternatively, programmers may abandon the notion of representing the Game of Life field with a two-dimensional array, and use a different data structure, such as a vector of coordinate pairs representing live cells. This allows the pattern to move about the field unhindered, as long as the population does not exceed the size of the live-coordinate array. The drawback is that counting live neighbours becomes a hash-table lookup or search operation, slowing down simulation speed. With more sophisticated data structures this problem can also be largely solved.\nFor exploring large patterns at great time depths, sophisticated algorithms such as Hashlife may be useful. There is also a method for implementation of the Game of Life and other cellular automata using arbitrary asynchronous updates while still exactly emulating the behaviour of the synchronous game. Source code examples that implement the basic Game of Life scenario in various programming languages, including C, C++, Java and Python can be found at Rosetta Code.\nVariations.\nSince the Game of Life's inception, new, similar cellular automata have been developed. The standard Game of Life is symbolized in rule-string notation as B3/S23. A cell is born if it has exactly three neighbours, survives if it has two or three living neighbours, and dies otherwise. The first number, or list of numbers, is what is required for a dead cell to be born. The second set is the requirement for a live cell to survive to the next generation. Hence B6/S16 means \"a cell is born if there are six neighbours, and lives on if there are either one or six neighbours\". Cellular automata on a two-dimensional grid that can be described in this way are known as Life-like cellular automata. Another common Life-like automaton, Highlife, is described by the rule B36/S23, because having six neighbours, in addition to the original game's B3/S23 rule, causes a birth. HighLife is best known for its frequently occurring replicators.\nAdditional Life-like cellular automata exist. The vast majority of these 218 different rules produce universes that are either too chaotic or too desolate to be of interest, but a large subset do display interesting behaviour. A further generalization produces the \"isotropic\" rulespace, with 2102 possible cellular automaton rules (the Game of Life again being one of them). These are rules that use the same square grid as the Life-like rules and the same eight-cell neighbourhood, and are likewise invariant under rotation and reflection. However, in isotropic rules, the positions of neighbour cells relative to each other may be taken into account in determining a cell's future state\u2014not just the total number of those neighbours.\nSome variations on The Game of Life modify the geometry of the universe as well as the rules. The above variations can be thought of as a two-dimensional square, because the world is two-dimensional and laid out in a square grid. One-dimensional square variations, known as elementary cellular automata, and three-dimensional square variations have been developed, as have two-dimensional hexagonal and triangular variations. A variant using aperiodic tiling grids has also been made.\nConway's rules may also be generalized such that instead of two states, \"live\" and \"dead\", there are three or more. State transitions are then determined either by a weighting system or by a table specifying separate transition rules for each state; for example, Mirek's Cellebration's multi-coloured Rules Table and Weighted Life rule families each include sample rules equivalent to the Game of Life.\nPatterns relating to fractals and fractal systems may also be observed in certain Life-like variations. For example, the automaton B1/S12 generates four very close approximations to the Sierpinski triangle when applied to a single live cell. The Sierpinski triangle can also be observed in the Game of Life by examining the long-term growth of an infinitely long single-cell-thick line of live cells, as well as in Highlife, Seeds (B2/S), and Stephen Wolfram's Rule 90.\nImmigration is a variation that is very similar to the Game of Life, except that there are two \"on\" states, often expressed as two different colours. Whenever a new cell is born, it takes on the on state that is the majority in the three cells that gave it birth. This feature can be used to examine interactions between spaceships and other objects within the game. Another similar variation, called QuadLife, involves four different on states. When a new cell is born from three different on neighbours, it takes the fourth value, and otherwise, like Immigration, it takes the majority value. Except for the variation among on cells, both of these variations act identically to the Game of Life.\nNotable programs.\nComputers have been used to follow and simulate the Game of Life since it was first publicized. When John Conway was first investigating how various starting configurations developed, he tracked them by hand using a go board with its black and white stones. This was tedious and prone to errors. The first interactive Game of Life program was written in an early version of ALGOL 68C for the PDP-7 by M. J. T. Guy and S. R. Bourne. The results were published in the October 1970 issue of \"Scientific American\", along with the statement: \"Without its help, some discoveries about the game would have been difficult to make.\"\nA color version of the Game of Life was written by Ed Hall in 1976 for Cromemco microcomputers, and a display from that program filled the cover of the June 1976 issue of \"Byte\". The advent of microcomputer-based color graphics from Cromemco has been credited with a revival of interest in the game.\nTwo early implementations of the Game of Life on home computers were by Malcolm Banthorpe written in BBC BASIC. The first was in the January 1984 issue of \"Acorn User\" magazine, and Banthorpe followed this with a three-dimensional version in the May 1984 issue. Susan Stepney, Professor of Computer Science at the University of York, followed this up in 1988 with Life on the Line, a program that generated one-dimensional cellular automata.\nThere are now thousands of Game of Life programs online, so a full list will not be provided here. The following is a small selection of programs with some special claim to notability, such as popularity or unusual features. Most of these programs incorporate a graphical user interface for pattern editing and simulation, the capability for simulating multiple rules including the Game of Life, and a large library of interesting patterns in the Game of Life and other cellular automaton rules.\nGoogle implemented an easter egg of the Game of Life in 2012. Users who search for the term are shown an implementation of the game in the search results page.\nThe visual novel \"Anonymous;Code\" includes a basic implementation of the Game of Life in it, which is connected to the plot of the novel. Near the end of \"Anonymous;Code\", a certain pattern that appears throughout the game as a tattoo on the heroine Momo Aizaki has to be entered into the Game of Life to complete the game (Kok's galaxy, the same pattern used as the logo for the open-source Game of Life program Golly).\nVarious musical composition techniques use the Game of Life, especially in MIDI sequencing. A variety of programs exist for creating sound from patterns generated in the Game of Life.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She is known for her notable clientele, feminist advocacy, literary contributions, and philanthropy. Her humanist education and cultural contributions influenced the roles of courtesans in the late Venetian Renaissance.\nIn her notable works, \"Capitoli in Terze rime and Lettere familiari a diversi (\"Familiar Letters to Various People\")\", Franco uses perceived virtue, reason, and fairness to advise male patricians and other associates. She exercised greater autonomy in her authorship than any other traditional Venetian woman due to her established reputation and influence.\nEarly life and education.\nVeronica Franco was born to a family in the \"Cittadino\" class. She developed her position in Renaissance Venetian society as a \"cortigiana onesta (Honest Courtesan)\", who were intellectual sex workers who derived their position in society from refinement and cultural prowess. They served in contrast to other sex workers such as \"cortigiana di lume\" or \"meretrice\" ('harlots') who were lower-class prostitutes.\nFranco received a respectable humanistic education at a young age from her brother's tutor, an unusual opportunity for Venetian women. She continued her education by mixing with learned men, writers, and painters. This granted her access to a Domenico Venier, a patron and advisor to women writers. She was able to use her education to contribute considerably to literary and artistic outlets.\nFranco learned additional skills from her mother, Paola Fracassa, who had an interest in finding suitable clients for her, as well as marrying her off.\nCareer.\nFranco wrote two volumes of poetry: \"Terze rime\" in 1575 and \"Lettere familiari a diversi\" in 1580.\nIn 1565, when she was about 20 years old, Veronica Franco was listed in the \"Catalogo de tutte le principal et pi\u00f9 honorate cortigiane di Venetia\" (\"Catalog of all the Principal and most Honored Courtesans of Venice\"), which gave the names, addresses, and fees of Venice's most prominent prostitutes; her mother was listed as the person to whom the fee should be paid (her \"go-between\").\nShe became involved in the 1570s with Domenico Venier's renowned literary salon in Venice, who served as a literary adviser not only to male writers but also to many women poets of the Veneto region.\nAs one of the \"pi\u00f9 honorate cortigiane\" in a wealthy and cosmopolitan city, Franco lived well for much of her working life, but without the automatic protection accorded to \"respectable\" women, she had to make her own way. She studied and sought patrons among the learned.\nIn 1575, during the epidemic of plague that ravaged the city, Franco was forced to leave Venice and lost much of her wealth when her house and possessions were looted. Upon her return in 1577, she defended herself against charges of witchcraft before the Inquisition, a crime commonly lodged against courtesans in those days. The charges were dropped. There is evidence that her connections among the Venetian nobility helped in her acquittal.\nWritings.\nIn 1575, Franco's first volume of poetry was published, her \"Terze rime\", containing 18 \"capitoli\" (verse epistles) by her and 7 by men writing in her praise. That same year saw an outbreak of plague in Venice, one that lasted two years and caused Franco to leave the city and to lose many of her possessions. In 1577, she unsuccessfully proposed to the city council that it should establish a home for poor women, of which she would become the administrator.\nIn 1580, Franco published her \"Lettere familiari a diversi\" (\"Familiar Letters to Various People\") which included 50 letters, as well as two sonnets addressed to King Henry III of France.\nFranco's success was not limited to being a coveted courtesan. It was her wittiness and often criticized voice that was immortalized by way of being published that brought forth much recognition. Records indicate that the number of actual publications was limited as they were thought to have been at her own expense or private publications. Her work is known to have been included in an anthology of women poets in the 18th century (1726) that was edited by Luisa Bergalli. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"When we too are armed and trained, we can convince men that we have hands, feet, and a heart like yours; and although we may be delicate and soft, some men who are delicate are also strong; and others, coarse and harsh, are cowards. Women have not yet realized this, for if they should decide to do so, they would be able to fight you until death; and to prove that I speak the truth, amongst so many women, I will be the first to act, setting an example for them to follow.\"\u2014\u200a\nThe embodiment of her role in the public realm was made evermore tangible, amongst the literary circles and the Venetian public during her polemic literary battle with Maffio Venier. The poem referenced above, \"Capitolo XVI\", \"A Challenge to a Poet Who Has Defamed Her\", is believed to have been one of the many directed to Maffio Venier. These poems are \"Capitolo XIII\", \"Capitolo XVI\", and \"Capitolo XXIII\" of her literary publication \"Terze Rime\".\nPersonal life.\nFrom extant records, we know that, by the time she was 18, Franco was briefly married to a mature, wealthy physician named Paolo Panizza. During her marriage she gave birth to her first child. she would eventually have six children, three of whom died in infancy.\nShe supported her children along with a household of tutors and servants for most of her life.\nLater life and death.\nHer later life is largely obscure, though surviving records suggest that although she won her freedom, she lost all of her material goods and wealth. Eventually, her last major benefactor died and left her with no financial support. There is little information for her life after 1580. Records suggest that she was less prosperous in her later years and is believed to have died in 1591 in relative poverty.\nPosthumous reception.\nIn the 1974 film \"Sex Through the Ages\" (originally titled \"On the Game\"), Louise Pajo played the part of Veronica Franco, a 16th century Venetian prostitute. In the film she appears in two scenes. One in which she seduces the homosexual King of France, Henry III; and another in which she is a sufferer of syphilis.\nFranco's life was recorded in the 1992 book \"The Honest Courtesan\" by U.S. author Margaret F. Rosenthal.\nCatherine McCormack portrayed Veronica Franco in the 1998 movie \"Dangerous Beauty,\" released as \"A Destiny of Her Own\" in some countries, based on Rosenthal's book.\nIn the 2000s Franco prompted scholarly inquiries on \"what it meant to be a public woman in Cinquecento Venice\". This directly pertained to her duality of both a courtesan and a published poet. Franco is referenced to have been a \"living performance of public art\u2014a renowned courtesan whose body was available to a certain exclusive clientele, a published author, and a public presence.\"\nFranco's literary work demonstrates her ability to defend women, as a whole, in a format that can be studied and understood as ahead of her time. Franco's work fearlessly embarked on juxtaposed realms such as sexuality and women's agency as a whole. In doing so, she challenged and disrupted the patriarchal norms that surrounded her.\nFranco is also portrayed in the 2012 Serbian novel named after her () authored by Serbian writer Katarina Brajovi\u0107.\nIn 2013, her work was interpreted as adopting \"a position of public authority that calls attention to her education, her rhetorical skill, and the solidarity she feels with women.\" She embodied in writing a duality, toggling between and addressing both private and public life matters. Her publications have allowed her work and proto-feminist efforts to transcend time.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "37040", "revid": "635492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37040", "title": "Wilhelmus", "text": "National anthem of the Netherlands\n\"Wilhelmus van Nassouwe\", known simply as \"Wilhelmus\", is the national anthem of both the Netherlands and its sovereign state, the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It dates back to at least 1572, making it the oldest national anthem in use today, provided that the latter is defined as consisting of both a melody and lyrics. Although \"Wilhelmus\" was not recognized as the official national anthem until 1932, it has always been popular with parts of the Dutch population and resurfaced on several occasions in the course of Dutch history before gaining its present status. It was also the anthem of the Netherlands Antilles from 1954 to 1964.\n\"Wilhelmus\" originated in the Dutch Revolt, the nation's struggle to achieve independence from the Spanish Empire. It tells of the Father of the Nation William of Orange who was stadtholder in the Netherlands under King Philip II of Spain. In the first person, as if quoting himself, William speaks to the Dutch about both the revolt and his own, personal struggle: to be faithful to the king, without being unfaithful to his conscience: to serve God and the Dutch. In the lyrics, William compares himself with the biblical David who serves under the tyrannical king Saul. As the merciful David defeats the unjust Saul and is rewarded by God with the kingdom of Israel, so too William hopes to be rewarded with a kingdom. Both \"Wilhelmus\" and the Dutch Revolt should be seen in the light of the 16th century Reformation in Europe\nand the resulting persecution of Protestants by the Spanish Inquisition in the Low Countries. Militant music proved very useful not only in lampooning Roman clerks and repressive monarchs but also in generating class-transcending social cohesion. In successfully combining a psalmic character with political relevancy, \"Wilhelmus\" stands as the pre-eminent example of the genre.\nInception.\nOrigins of melody.\nThe melody of \"Wilhelmus\" was borrowed from a well-known Roman Catholic French song titled \"Autre chanson de la ville de Chartres assi\u00e9g\u00e9e par le prince de Cond\u00e9\" (or \"Chartres\" in short). This song ridiculed the failed Siege of Chartres in 1568 by the Huguenot (Protestant) Prince de Cond\u00e9 during the French Wars of Religion. However, the triumphant contents of \"Wilhelmus\" differ greatly from the content of the original song, making it subversive at several levels. Thus, the Dutch Protestants had taken over an anti-Protestant song, and adapted it into propaganda for their own agenda. In that way, \"Wilhelmus\" was typical for its time: it was common practice in the 16th century for warring groups to steal each other's songs in order to rewrite them.\nEven though the melody stems from 1568, the first known written down version of it comes from 1574; at the time the anthem was sung at a much quicker pace. Dutch composer Adriaen Valerius recorded the current melody of \"Wilhelmus\" in his \"Nederlantsche Gedenck-clanck\" in 1626, slowing down the melody's pace, probably to allow it to be sung in churches.\nOrigins of lyrics.\nThe origins of the lyrics are uncertain. \"Wilhelmus\" was first written some time between the start of the Eighty Years' War in April 1568 and the capture of Brielle on 1 April 1572. Soon after the anthem was finished, it was said that either former Antwerp mayor Philips of Marnix or the politician Dirck Coornhert wrote the lyrics. However, this is disputed as neither Marnix nor Coornhert ever mentioned that they had written the lyrics, even though the song was immensely popular in their time. \"Wilhelmus\" also has some odd rhymes in it. In some cases the vowels of certain words were altered to allow them to rhyme with other words. Some see this as evidence that neither Marnix or Coornhert wrote the anthem, as they were both experienced poets when \"Wilhelmus\" was written, and it is said they would not have taken these small liberties. Hence some believe that the lyrics of the Dutch national anthem were the creation of someone who just wrote one poem for the occasion and then disappeared from history. A French translation of \"Wilhelmus\" appeared around 1582.\nRecent stylometric research has mentioned Pieter Datheen as a possible author of the text of the Dutch national anthem. By chance, Dutch and Flemish researchers (Meertens Institute, Utrecht University and University of Antwerp) discovered a striking number of similarities between his style and the style of the national anthem.\nStructure and interpretation.\nThe complete text comprises fifteen stanzas. The anthem is an acrostic: the first letters of the fifteen stanzas formed the name \"Willem van Nassov\" (\"Nassov\" was a contemporary orthographic variant of \"Nassau\"). In the current Dutch spelling the first words of the 12th and 13th stanzas begin with Z instead of S.\nLike many of the songs of the period, it has a complex structure, composed around a thematic chiasmus: the text is symmetrical, in that verses one and 15 resemble one another in meaning, as do verses two and 14, three and 13, etc., until they converge in the 8th verse, the heart of the song: \"Oh David, thou soughtest shelter from King Saul's tyranny. Even so I fled this welter\", where the comparison is made not only between the biblical David and William of Orange as a merciful and just leader of the Dutch Revolt, but also between the tyrant King Saul and the Spanish crown. William expresses his hope that he will be rewarded with a kingdom, or \"realm\", just as David was rewarded with the throne of Israel.\nIn the first person, as if quoting himself, William speaks about how his disagreement with his king troubles him; he tries to be faithful to his king, but he is above all faithful to his conscience: to serve God and the Dutch people. Therefore, the last two lines of the first stanza indicate that the leader of the Dutch civil war against the Spanish Empire, of which they were part, had no specific quarrel with king Philip II of Spain, but rather with his emissaries in the Low Countries, such as Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba. This may have been because at the time (late 16th century) it was uncommon to doubt publicly the divine right of kings, who were accountable to God alone. In 1581 the Netherlands nevertheless rejected the legitimacy of the king of Spain's rule over it in the Act of Abjuration.\nThe word \"Duytschen\" in the first stanza, generally translated into English as 'Dutch', 'native' or 'Germanic', is a reference to William's roots; its modern Dutch equivalent, \"Duits\", exclusively means 'German', and while it may refer to William's ancestral house (House of Nassau) or to the lands of the Holy Roman Empire it is most probably a reference to an older meaning of the word, which can loosely be translated as 'Germanic', and seeks to position William as a person with a personal connection with the Low Countries as opposed to the king of Spain, Philip II, who was commonly portrayed as foreign, disconnected and out of touch. In doing so, William is also implicitly comparing himself with the well liked Charles V (Philip's father) who, unlike his son, was born in the Low Countries, spoke Dutch and visited the Low Countries more often than any other part of his realm.\nPerformance.\nHistory.\nThough only proclaimed the national anthem in 1932, the \"Wilhelmus\" already had a centuries-old history. It had been sung on many official occasions and at many important events since the outbreak of the Dutch Revolt in 1568, such as the siege of Haarlem in 1573 and the ceremonial entry of the Prince of Orange into Brussels on 18 September 1578.\nIt has been claimed that during the gruesome torture of Balthasar G\u00e9rard (the assassin of William of Orange) in 1584, the song was sung by the guards who sought to overpower G\u00e9rard's screams when boiling pigs' fat was poured over him. G\u00e9rard allegedly responded \"Sing! Dutch sinners! Sing! But know that soon I shall be sung of!\".\nAnother legend claims that following the Navigation Act 1651 (an ordinance by Oliver Cromwell requiring all foreign fleets in the North Sea or the Channel to dip their flag in salute) the \"Wilhelmus\" was sung (or rather, shouted) by the sailors on the Dutch flagship in response to the first warning shot fired by an English fleet under Robert Blake, when their captain Maarten Tromp refused to lower his flag. At the end of the song, which coincided with the third and last English warning shot, Tromp fired a full broadside, thereby beginning the Battle of Goodwin Sands and the First Anglo-Dutch War.\nDuring the Dutch Golden Age, the popular song became the \"de facto\" anthem of the House of Orange-Nassau and its supporters \u2013 which meant, in the politics of the time, songs of a specific political faction which was involved in a prolonged struggle with opposing factions (which sometimes became violent, verging on civil war). Therefore, the song's status paralled that of its faction. Trumpets played the \"Wilhelmus\" when Prince Maurits visited Breda, and again when he was received in state in Amsterdam in May 1618. When William V arrived in Schoonhoven in 1787, after the authority of the stadholders had been restored, the church bells are said to have played the \"Wilhelmus\" continuously. After the Batavian Revolution, inspired by the French Revolution, it had come to be called the \"Princes' March\" as it was banned during the rule of the Patriots, who did not support the House of Orange-Nassau.\nHowever, at the foundation of the Sovereign Principality of the United Netherlands, forerunner of the current Dutch state, in 1813, the \"Wilhelmus\" had fallen out of favour. The newly installed prince, William Frederick (the future King William I), son of William V, had completed his family's quest to unite the Low Countries. Having received the \"realm\" referenced in the \"Wilhelmus\", William Frederick now sought to represent the entire nation and stand above factions. He decided to break with the song which served his family as heads of a faction. A competition was organised for a new anthem, and the victor was , written by Hendrik Tollens, which served as the official Dutch anthem from 1815 until 1932.\n never gained traction and was generally disliked, with the second line, \"Free from foreign stain\", being increasingly seen as racist. Meanwhile, \"Wilhelmus\" remained popular. An arrangement created by Austrian musician Eduard Kremser was played during the inauguration of Queen Wilhelmina. Alongside \"Wilhelmus\", Kremser created arrangements of other songs from the Eighty Years' War written by Adrianus Valerius, one of which is the popular Thanksgiving song \"We Gather Together\". On 10 May 1932, partially because Wilhelmina suggested the idea, \"Wilhelmus\" replaced \"Wien Ne\u00earlands Bloed\" as the official Dutch anthem in time for the silver jubilee of Wilhelmina's inauguration, the harmonization was made by Dutch composer Walther Boer. Additionally, the change was largely driven by growing dislike of Tollens' song, with Socialists refusing to sing it. \"Wilhelmus\" itself received some protest over its historical association with the Orangists, but this disappeared after the Second World War. \n\"Wilhelmus\" was also translated into Malay, of which was sung back when Indonesia was under Dutch colonial rule, with the following lyrics:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDuring the German occupation of the Netherlands, Arthur Seyss-Inquart, the Nazi , banned all the emblems of the Dutch royal family, including the \"Wilhelmus\". It was then taken up by all factions of the Dutch resistance, even those socialists who had previously taken an anti-monarchist stance. The pro-German Nationaal-Socialistische Beweging (NSB), who had sung the \"Wilhelmus\" at their meetings before the occupation, replaced it with (\"All Men of Dutch Origin\"). The anthem was drawn to the attention of the English-speaking world by the 1942 British war film \"One of Our Aircraft Is Missing\". The film concerns a Royal Air Force bomber crew who are shot down over the occupied Netherlands and are helped to escape by the local inhabitants. The melody is heard during the film as part of the campaign of passive resistance by the population, and it finishes with the coat of arms of the Netherlands on screen while the \"Wilhelmus\" is played. Today, the sixth verse is sometimes sung after the first, because it contains the line (\"Defeat the tyranny, which pierces my heart\") was popular with the resistance fighters, as it was interpreted as referring to the Nazis (it originally meant the Habsburgs).\nAnnouncer Bert Garthoff gained fame by concluding NIROM's broadcasts on the day of the surrender to Japan during the Dutch East Indies campaign on 8 March 1942 with the words \"Listeners, we're closing now. Farewell, until better days. Long live the Fatherland, long live the Queen.\" Garthoff later said that the station's employees were told by the Japanese authorities to \"carry on as usual\". This they did by concluding the broadcasts with the Dutch national anthem, much to the surprise of the listeners. When the Japanese found out about this, they executed three NIROM employees in retaliation.\nCurrent usage.\nThe \"Wilhelmus\" is to be played only once at a ceremony or other event and, if possible, it is to be the last piece of music to be played when receiving a foreign head of state or emissary.\nThe \"Wilhelmus\" is played during international sport events in the Netherlands or involving athletes representing the Netherlands, such as the FIFA World Cup, the UEFA European Championship, the Olympic Games, and the Dutch Grand Prix. In nearly every case the 1st and 6th stanzas (or repeating the last lines), or the 1st stanza alone, are sung/played rather than the entire song, which would result in about 15 minutes of music. (Each of the 15 stanzas lasts 56 seconds, and the last stanza has a ritenuto.)\nThe \"Wilhelmus\" is also widely used in Flemish nationalist gatherings as a symbol of cultural unity with the Netherlands. Yearly rallies like the and the close with singing the 6th stanza, after which the Flemish national anthem is sung.\nVariations.\nAn important set of variations on the melody of \"Wilhelmus van Nassouwe\" is that by the blind carillon-player Jacob van Eyck in his mid-17th century collection of variations \"Der Fluyten Lust-hof\".\nThe grand ducal anthem of Luxembourg, which bares the same name, has its melody derived from \"Wilhelmus\". The song was introduced during the visit of the Dutch royal pair in a parade titled \"Vive la Roi, Vive la Reine\" (\"Long live the King, Long live the Queen\") and was used even after the end of the personal union. It had lyrics written to it in 1915 and 1919, with the 1919 lyrics on the melody being in official use from the same year.\nThe song \"Wenn alle untreu werden\" (\"When All Become Unfaithful\"), better known as \"Das Treuelied\", written by the poet Max von Schenkendorf, used the melody of a French song titled \"Pr aller \u00e0 la chasse faut \u00eatre matineux\" but since 1923 the melody of the \"Wilhelmus\" was introduced for the song. After World War I, this song became popular among German nationalist groups. It became one of the most popular songs of the SS, together with the \"Horst-Wessel-Lied\".\nThe melody is also used in the Swedish folk song \"Ack, G\u00f6ta konungarike\" (\"Alas, Gothic Kingdom\"), written in 1626, which deals with the liberation struggle of Sweden under Gustav Vasa during the 16th century.\nLyrics.\nThe \"Wilhelmus\" was first printed in a (lit. 'Beggars' songbook') in 1581. It used the following text as an introduction to the \"Wilhelmus\":'\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\nThe original text contains 15 stanzas and is written in the form of an acrostic; the first letter in each of the following stanzas, highlighted in bold below, spell out \"William of Nassau\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a standardized variety of Malay, an Austronesian language that has been used as a lingua franca in the multilingual Indonesian archipelago for centuries. With over 280 million inhabitants, Indonesia ranks as the fourth-most populous nation globally. According to the 2020 census, over 97% of Indonesians are fluent in Indonesian, making it the largest language by number of speakers in Southeast Asia and one of the most widely spoken languages in the world.14 Indonesian vocabulary has been influenced by various native regional languages such as Javanese, Sundanese, Minangkabau, Balinese, Banjarese, and Buginese, as well as by foreign languages such as Arabic, Dutch, Hokkien, Portuguese, Sanskrit, and English. Many borrowed words have been adapted to fit the phonetic and grammatical rules of Indonesian, enriching the language and reflecting Indonesia's diverse linguistic heritage.\nMost Indonesians, aside from speaking the national language, are fluent in at least one of the more than 700 indigenous local languages; examples include Javanese and Sundanese, which are commonly used at home and within the local community. However, most formal education and nearly all national mass media, governance, administration, and judiciary and other forms of communication are conducted in Indonesian.\nUnder Indonesian rule from 1976 to 1999, Indonesian was designated as the official language of East Timor. It has the status of a working language under the country's constitution along with English.3 In November 2023, the Indonesian language was recognized as one of the official languages of the UNESCO General Conference.\nThe term \"Indonesian\" is primarily associated with the national standard dialect (). However, in a looser sense, it also encompasses the various local varieties spoken throughout the Indonesian archipelago. Standard Indonesian is confined mostly to formal situations, existing in a diglossic relationship with vernacular Malay varieties, which are commonly used for daily communication, coexisting with the aforementioned regional languages and with Malay creoles; standard Indonesian is spoken in informal speech as a lingua franca between vernacular Malay dialects, Malay creoles, and regional languages.\nHistory.\nStandard Indonesian is a standard language of \"Riau Malay\", which despite its common name is not based on the vernacular Malay dialects of the Riau Islands, but rather represents a form of Classical Malay as used in the 19th and early 20th centuries in the Riau-Lingga Sultanate. Classical Malay had emerged as a literary language in the royal courts along both shores of the Strait of Malacca, including the Johor Sultanate and Malacca Sultanate.70 Originally spoken in Northeast Sumatra, Malay has been used as a lingua franca in the Indonesian archipelago for half a millennium. It might be attributed to its ancestor, the Old Malay language (which can be traced back to the 7th century). The Kedukan Bukit Inscription is the oldest surviving specimen of Old Malay, the language used by Srivijayan empire. Since the 7th century, the Old Malay language has been used in Nusantara (archipelago) (Indonesian archipelago), evidenced by Srivijaya inscriptions and by other inscriptions from coastal areas of the archipelago, such as Sojomerto inscription. \nIndonesian (in its standard form) has essentially the same material basis as the Malaysian standard of Malay and is therefore considered to be a variety of the pluricentric Malay language. However, it does differ from Malaysian Malay in several respects, with differences in pronunciation and vocabulary. These differences are due mainly to the Dutch and Javanese influences on Indonesian. Indonesian was also influenced by the (lit.\u2009'market Malay'), which was the lingua franca of the archipelago in colonial times, and thus indirectly by other spoken languages of the islands.\nMalaysian Malay claims to be closer to the classical Malay of earlier centuries, even though modern Malaysian has been heavily influenced, in lexicon as well as in syntax, by English. The question of whether High Malay (Court Malay) or Low Malay (Bazaar Malay) was the true parent of the Indonesian language is still in debate. High Malay was the official language used in the court of the Johor Sultanate and continued by the Dutch-administered territory of Riau-Lingga, while Low Malay was commonly used in marketplaces and ports of the archipelago. Some linguists have argued that it was the more common Low Malay that formed the base of the Indonesian language.\nOld Malay as \"lingua franca\".\nTrade contacts carried on by various ethnic peoples at the time were the main vehicle for spreading the Old Malay language, which was the main communications medium among the traders. Ultimately, the Old Malay language became a lingua franca and was spoken widely by most people in the archipelago. The beginning of the common era saw the growing influence of Indian civilisation in the archipelago. With the penetration and proliferation of Sanskrit vocabulary and the influence of major Indian religions such as Hinduism and Buddhism, Ancient Malay evolved into the Old Malay. The oldest uncontroversial specimens of Old Malay are the 7th century CE Sojomerto inscription from Central Java, Kedukan Bukit Inscription from South Sumatra, Indonesia and several other inscriptions dating from the 7th to 10th centuries discovered in Sumatra, Java, other islands of the Sunda archipelago, as well as Luzon, Philippines. All these Old Malay inscriptions used either scripts of Indian origin such as Pallava, Nagari or the Indian-influenced old Sumatran characters. The Old Malay system is greatly influenced by Sanskrit scriptures in terms of phonemes, morphemes, vocabulary and the characteristics of scholarship, particularly when the words are closely related to Indian culture. Further research stated that Old Malay and Modern Malay are forms of the same language, in spite of some considerable differences between them.\nClassical Malay of Riau-Lingga.\nStandard Indonesian is a standard language of \"Riau Malay\", which despite its common name is not based on the vernacular Malay dialects of the Riau Islands, but rather represents a form of Classical Malay as used in the 19th and early 20th centuries in the Riau-Lingga Sultanate. Classical Malay had emerged as a literary language in the royal courts along both shores of the Strait of Malacca, including the Johor Sultanate and Malacca Sultanate.70 The period of Classical Malay started when Islam gained its foothold in the region and the elevation of its status to a state religion. As a result of Islamisation and growth in trade with the Muslim world, this era witnessed the penetration of Arabic and Persian vocabulary as well as the integration of major Islamic cultures with local Malay culture. The earliest instances of Arabic lexicons incorporated in the pre-Classical Malay written in Kawi was found in the Minye Tujoh inscription dated 1380 CE from Aceh in Sumatra. Nevertheless, pre-Classical Malay took on a more radical form more than half a century earlier as attested in the 1303 CE Terengganu Inscription Stone as well as the 1468 CE Pengkalan Kempas Inscription, both from the Malay Peninsula. Both inscriptions not only serve as the evidence of Islam as a state religion but also as the oldest surviving specimen of the dominant classical orthographic form, the Jawi script. Similar inscriptions containing various adopted Arabic terms with some of them still written the Indianised scripts were also discovered in other parts of Sumatra and Borneo.\nDutch East Indies Colonial Malay.\nWhen the Dutch East India Company (VOC) first arrived in the archipelago at the start of the 1600s, the Malay language was a significant trading and political language due to the influence of the Malaccan Sultanate and later the Portuguese. However, the language had never been dominant among the population of the Indonesian archipelago as it was limited to mercantile activity. The VOC adopted the Malay language as the administrative language of their trading outpost in the east. Following the bankruptcy of the VOC, the Batavian Republic took control of the colony in 1799, and it was only then that education in and promotion of Dutch began in the colony.\nThe 19th century was the period of strong Western political and commercial domination in the archipelago. The Dutch colonists, realising the importance of understanding the local languages and cultures, began establishing various centres of linguistic, literary and cultural studies in universities like Leiden and London. The use of Latin script began to expand in the fields of administration and education whereby the influence of Dutch literatures and languages started to penetrate and spread gradually into the language.\nEven then, Dutch administrators were remarkably reluctant to promote the use of Dutch compared to other colonial regimes. Dutch thus remained the language of a small elite: in 1940, only 2% of the total population could speak Dutch. Nevertheless, it did have a significant influence on the development of Malay in the colony: during the colonial era, the language that would be standardized as Indonesian absorbed a large amount of Dutch vocabulary in the form of loanwords.\nThe Dutch colonial government recognised the Malacca-Johor Malay used in Riau-Lingga as \"High Malay\" and promoted it as a medium of communication between the Dutch and local population. The language was also taught in schools not only in Riau but also in East Sumatra, Java, Kalimantan and East Indonesia. In 1864, the Dutch colonial government was therefore decided to disseminate this language - and not Dutch - throughout the colony. To this end, the colonial government stimulated the study, standardisation and modernisation of Malay, imposing it via its institutions, via education, the missions and the media, and via the literary works produced by the state publishers Balai Poestaka. In this respect, the Dutch pursued a non-chauvinistic cultural policy. Another catalyst in the movement towards standardization of Malay in Western script was an amalgam of philology and a growing consciousness of an Indies identity such that a \"lingua franca\" justification for Malay had become insufficient. In reality, Klinkert's pure Malacca or Riau Malay was unusable in the eastern part of Indies even in the coastal regions. In 1910, Sasrasoeganda Koewatin, a prominent Malay language teacher of Kweekschool and OpIeidingschool in Yogyakarta, wrote a Malay grammar book entitled \"Kitab Jang Menjatakan Djalannja Bahasa Melajoe\" in which is the first Malay grammar book in Latin script which became the basis for the Indonesian language in use today.\nThe birth of Indonesian: adoption as the national language.\nThe nationalist movement that ultimately brought Indonesian to its national language status rejected Dutch from the outset. However, the rapid disappearance of Dutch was a very unusual case compared with other colonized countries, where the colonial language generally has continued to function as the language of politics, bureaucracy, education, technology, and other fields of importance for a significant time after independence. The Indonesian scholar Soenjono Dardjowidjojo even goes so far as to say that when compared to the situation in other Asian countries such as India, Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines, \"Indonesian is perhaps the only language that has achieved the status of a national language in its true sense\" since it truly dominates in all spheres of Indonesian society. The ease with which Indonesia eliminated the language of its former colonial power can perhaps be explained as much by Dutch policy as by Indonesian nationalism. In marked contrast to the French, Spanish and Portuguese, who pursued an assimilation colonial policy, or even the British, the Dutch did not attempt to spread their language among the indigenous population. In fact, they consciously prevented the language from being spread by refusing to provide education, especially in Dutch, to the native Indonesians so they would not come to see themselves as equals. Moreover, the Dutch wished to prevent the Indonesians from elevating their perceived social status by taking on elements of Dutch culture. Thus, until the 1930s, they maintained a minimalist regime and allowed Malay to spread quickly throughout the archipelago.Dutch dominance at that time covered nearly all aspects, with official forums requiring the use of Dutch, although since the Second Youth Congress (1928) the use of Indonesian as the national language was agreed on as one of the tools in the independence struggle. As of it, Mohammad Hoesni Thamrin inveighed actions underestimating Indonesian. After some criticism and protests, the use of Indonesian was allowed since the \"Volksraad\" sessions held in July 1938. By the time they tried to counter the spread of Malay by teaching Dutch to the natives, it was too late, and in 1942, the Japanese conquered Indonesia. The Japanese mandated that all official business be conducted in Indonesian and quickly outlawed the use of the Dutch language. Three years later, the Indonesians themselves formally abolished the language and established \"bahasa Indonesia\" as the national language of the new nation. The term \"bahasa Indonesia\" itself had been proposed by Mohammad Tabrani in 1926, and Tabrani had further proposed the term over calling the language Malay language during the First Youth Congress in 1926.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"\"Jang dinamakan \"bahasa Indonesia\" jaitoe bahasa Melajoe jang soenggoehpoen pokoknja berasal dari \"Melajoe Riau\" akan tetapi jang soedah ditambah, dioebah atau dikoerangi menoeroet keperloean zaman dan alam baharoe, hingga bahasa itoe laloe moedah dipakai oleh rakjat di seloeroeh Indonesia; pembaharoean bahasa Melajoe hingga kini mendjadi bahasa Indonesia itoe haroes dilakoekan oleh kaoem ahli jang beralam baharoe, ialah alam kebangsaan Indonesia.\"\" (Indonesian for \"What is called \"Indonesian\" is the Malay which originally came from \"Riau Malay\" but which has been added to, changed or modified according to the needs of the times and the new world, so that the language is now used by the people throughout Indonesia; the renewal of the Malay until now to become Indonesian must be carried out by experts who are from the new world, namely the Indonesian national world.\")\n \u2014 Excerpt of Ki Hadjar Dewantara's \"Bahasa Indonesia didalam pergoroean\", a paper presented at the First Indonesian Language Conference at Surakarta, 25\u201328 June 1938.\nSeveral years prior to the congress, Swiss linguist, Renward Brandstetter wrote \"\" in 4 essays from 1910 to 1915. The essays were translated into English in 1916. By \"Indonesia\", he meant the name of the geographical region, and by \"Indonesian languages\" he meant Malayo-Polynesian languages west of New Guinea, because by that time there was still no notion of Indonesian language.\nSutan Takdir Alisjahbana was a great promoter of the use and development of Indonesian and he was greatly exaggerating the decline of Dutch. Higher education was still in Dutch and many educated Indonesians were writing and speaking in Dutch in many situations (and were still doing so well after independence was achieved). He believed passionately in the need to develop Indonesian so that it could take its place as a fully adequate national language, able to replace Dutch as a means of entry into modern international culture. In 1933, he began the magazine \"Pujangga Baru\" (New Writer \u2014 \"Poedjangga Baroe\" in the original spelling) with co-editors Amir Hamzah and Armijn Pane. The language of Pujangga Baru came in for criticism from those associated with the more classical School Malay and it was accused of publishing Dutch written with an Indonesian vocabulary. Alisjahbana would no doubt have taken the criticism as a demonstration of his success. To him the language of Pujangga Baru pointed the way to the future, to an elaborated, Westernised language able to express all the concepts of the modern world. As an example, among the many innovations they condemned was use of the word \"bisa\" instead of \"dapat\" for 'can'. In Malay \"bisa\" meant only 'poison from an animal's bite' and the increasing use of Javanese \"bisa\" in the new meaning they regarded as one of the many threats to the language's purity. Unlike more traditional intellectuals, he did not look to Classical Malay and the past. For him, Indonesian was a new concept; a new beginning was needed and he looked to Western civilisation, with its dynamic society of individuals freed from traditional fetters, as his inspiration.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Bahasa Indonesia ialah bahasa Melajoe Perhoeboengan, jang diperkaja dengan zat-zat dari Melajoe Kesoesastraan, bahasa Djawa, bahasa Belanda dan dengan lebih koerang bahasa Austronesia jang Iain-lain, sedang peroebahan saraf banjak terdjadi dan begitoe poela peroebahan tinggi boenji dan tekanan.

Indonesian has become the language of culture and will grow with Indonesian culture.\")\n \u2014 Excerpt of Sanoesi Pane's \"Sedjarah Bahasa Indonesia\", a paper presented at the First Indonesian Language Conference at Surakarta, 25\u201328 June 1938.\nIndonesian language in Japanese occupation, Old Order, and New Order.\nOnce the Japanese overturned Dutch rule, a prohibition on the use of the Dutch language led to an expansion of Indonesian language newspapers and pressure on them to increase the language's wordstock. The Japanese agreed to the establishment of the Komisi Bahasa (Language Commission) in October 1942, formally headed by three Japanese but with a number of prominent Indonesian intellectuals playing the major part in its activities. Soewandi, later to be Minister of Education and Culture, was appointed secretary, Alisjahbana was appointed an 'expert secretary' and other members included the future president and vice-president, Sukarno and Hatta. Journalists, beginning a practice that has continued to the present, did not wait for the \"Komisi Bahasa\" to provide new words, but actively participated themselves in coining terms. Many of the Komisi Bahasa's terms never found public acceptance and after the Japanese period were replaced by the original Dutch forms, including \"jantera\" (Sanskrit for 'wheel'), which temporarily replaced \"mesin\" (machine), \"ketua negara\" (literally 'chairman of state'), which had replaced \"presiden\" (president) and \"kilang\" (meaning 'mill'), which had replaced \"pabrik\" (factory). In a few cases, however, coinings permanently replaced earlier Dutch terms, including \"pajak\" (earlier meaning 'monopoly') instead of \"belasting\" (tax) and \"senam\" (meaning 'exercise') instead of \"gimnastik\" (gymnastics). The Komisi Bahasa is said to have coined more than 7000 terms, although few of these gained common acceptance.\nThe adoption of Indonesian as the country's national language was in contrast to most other post-colonial states. Neither the language with the most native speakers (Javanese) nor the language of the former European colonial power (Dutch) was to be adopted. Instead, a local language with far fewer native speakers than the most widely spoken local language was chosen (nevertheless, Malay was the second most widely spoken language in the colony after Javanese, and had many L2 speakers using it for trade, administration, and education).\nIn 1945, when Indonesia declared its independence, Indonesian was formally declared the national language, despite being the native language of only about 5% of the population. In contrast, Javanese and Sundanese were the mother tongues of 42\u201348% and 15% respectively. The combination of nationalistic, political, and practical concerns ultimately led to the successful adoption of Indonesian as a national language. In 1945, Javanese was easily the most prominent language in Indonesia. It was the native language of nearly half the population, the primary language of politics and economics, and the language of courtly, religious, and literary tradition. What it lacked, however, was the ability to unite the diverse Indonesian population as a whole. With thousands of islands and hundreds of different languages, the newly independent country of Indonesia had to find a national language that could realistically be spoken by the majority of the population and that would not divide the nation by favouring one ethnic group, namely the Javanese, over the others. In 1945, Indonesian was already in widespread use; in fact, it had been for roughly a thousand years. Over that long period, Malay, which would later become standardized as Indonesian, was the primary language of commerce and travel. It was also the language used for the propagation of Islam in the 13th to 17th centuries, as well as the language of instruction used by Portuguese and Dutch missionaries attempting to convert the indigenous people to Christianity. The combination of these factors meant that the language was already known to some degree by most of the population, and it could be more easily adopted as the national language than perhaps any other. Moreover, it was the language of the sultanate of Brunei and of future Malaysia, on which some Indonesian nationalists had claims.\nOver the first 53 years of Indonesian independence, the country's first two presidents, Sukarno and Suharto, constantly nurtured the sense of national unity embodied by Indonesian, and the language remains an essential component of Indonesian identity. Through a language planning program that made Indonesian the language of politics, education, and nation-building in general, Indonesian became one of the few success stories of an indigenous language effectively overtaking that of a country's colonisers to become the \"de jure\" and \"de facto\" official language. Today, Indonesian continues to function as the language of national identity as the Congress of Indonesian Youth envisioned, and also serves as the language of education, literacy, modernization, and social mobility. Despite still being a second language to most Indonesians, it is unquestionably the language of the Indonesian nation as a whole, as it has had unrivalled success as a factor in nation-building and the strengthening of Indonesian identity.\nModern and colloquial Indonesian.\nIndonesian is spoken as a mother tongue and national language. Over 200 million people regularly make use of the national language, with varying degrees of proficiency. In a nation that is home to more than 700 native languages and a vast array of ethnic groups, it plays an important unifying and cross-archipelagic role for the country. Use of the national language is abundant in the media, government bodies, schools, universities, workplaces, among members of the upper-class or nobility and also in formal situations, despite the 2010 census showing only 19.94% of over-five-year-olds speak mainly Indonesian at home.\nStandard Indonesian is used in books and newspapers and on television/radio news broadcasts. The standard dialect, however, is rarely used in daily conversations, being confined mostly to formal settings. While this is a phenomenon common to most languages in the world (for example, spoken English does not always correspond to its written standards), the proximity of spoken Indonesian (in terms of grammar and vocabulary) to its normative form is noticeably low. This is mostly due to Indonesians combining aspects of their own local languages (e.g., Javanese, Sundanese, and Balinese) with Indonesian. This results in various vernacular varieties of Indonesian, the very types that a foreigner is most likely to hear upon arriving in any Indonesian city or town. This phenomenon is amplified by the use of Indonesian slang, particularly in the cities. Unlike the relatively uniform standard variety, Vernacular Indonesian exhibits a high degree of geographical variation, though Colloquial Jakartan Indonesian functions as the \"de facto\" norm of informal language and is a popular source of influence throughout the archipelago. There is language shift of first language among Indonesian into Indonesian from other language in Indonesia caused by ethnic diversity than urbanicity.\nThe most common and widely used colloquial Indonesian is heavily influenced by the Betawi language, a Malay-based creole of Jakarta, amplified by its popularity in Indonesian popular culture in mass media and Jakarta's status as the national capital. In informal spoken Indonesian, various words are replaced with those of a less formal nature. For example, (no) is often replaced with the Betawi form or the even simpler , while (like, similar to) is often replaced with . or (very), the term to express intensity, is often replaced with the Javanese-influenced . As for pronunciation, the diphthongs \"ai\" and \"au\" on the end of base words are typically pronounced as and . In informal writing, the spelling of words is modified to reflect the actual pronunciation in a way that can be produced with less effort. For example, becomes or , becomes , becomes . In verbs, the prefix \"me-\" is often dropped, although an initial nasal consonant is often retained, as when becomes (the base word is ). The suffixes \"-kan\" and \"-i\" are often replaced by \"-in\". For example, becomes , becomes . The latter grammatical aspect is one often closely related to the Indonesian spoken in Jakarta and its surrounding areas. \nClassification and related languages.\nMalay historical linguists agree on the likelihood of the Malay homeland being in western Borneo. A form known as Proto-Malay language was spoken in Borneo at least by 1000 BCE and was, it has been argued, the ancestral language of all subsequent Malayan languages. Its ancestor, Proto-Malayo-Polynesian, a descendant of the Proto-Austronesian language, began to break up by at least 2000 BCE, possibly as a result of the southward expansion of Austronesian peoples into Maritime Southeast Asia from the island of Taiwan. Indonesian, which originated from Malay, is a member of the Austronesian family of languages, which includes languages from Southeast Asia, the Pacific Ocean and Madagascar, with a smaller number in continental Asia. The formal register has a high degree of mutual intelligibility with the Malaysian standard of Malay, which is officially known there as , despite the numerous lexical differences. However, vernacular varieties spoken in Indonesia and Malaysia share limited intelligibility, which is evidenced by the fact that Malaysians have difficulties understanding Indonesian sinetron (soap opera) aired on Malaysia TV stations, and vice versa.\nMalagasy, a geographic outlier spoken in Madagascar in the Indian Ocean; the Philippines national language, Filipino; Formosan in Taiwan's aboriginal population; and the native M\u0101ori language of New Zealand are also members of this language family. Although each language of the family is mutually unintelligible, their similarities are rather striking. Many roots have come virtually unchanged from their common ancestor, Proto-Austronesian language. There are many cognates found in the languages' words for kinship, health, body parts and common animals. Numbers, especially, show remarkable similarities.\nThere are more than 700 local languages in Indonesian islands, such as Javanese, Sundanese, etc. While Malay as the source of Indonesian is the mother tongue of ethnic Malay who lives along the east coast of Sumatra, in the Riau Archipelago, and on the south and west coast of Kalimantan (Borneo). There are several areas, such as Jakarta, Manado, Lesser Sunda islands, and Mollucas which has Malay-based trade languages. Thus, a large proportion of Indonesians use at least two languages daily, including Indonesian and local languages. When two languages are used by the same people in this way, they are likely to influence each other.\nAside from local languages, Dutch made the highest contribution to the Indonesian vocabulary, due to the Dutch colonization over three centuries, from the 16th century until the mid-20th century. Asian languages also influenced the language, with Chinese influencing Indonesian during the 15th and 16th centuries due to the spice trade; Sanskrit, Prakrit contributing during the flourishing of Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms from the 2nd to the 14th century; followed by Arabic after the spread of Islam in the archipelago in the 13th century. Loanwords from Portuguese were mainly connected with articles that the early European traders and explorers brought to Southeast Asia. Indonesian also receives many English words as a result of globalization and modernization, especially since the 1990s, as far as the Internet's emergence and development until the present day. Some Indonesian words correspond to Malay loanwords in English, among them the common words \"orangutan\", \"gong\", \"bamboo\", \"rattan\", \"sarong\", and the less common words such as \"paddy\", \"sago\" and \"kapok\", all of which were inherited in Indonesian from Malay but borrowed from Malay in English. The phrase \"to run amok\" comes from the Malay verb (to run out of control, to rage).\nIndonesian is neither a pidgin nor a creole since its characteristics do not meet any of the criteria for either. It is believed that the Indonesian language was one of the means to achieve independence, but it is opened to receive vocabulary from other foreign languages aside from Malay that it has made contact with since the colonialism era, such as Dutch, English and Arabic among others, as the loan words keep increasing each year.\nGeographical distribution.\nAccording to the 2025 census, Indonesian had 80\u00a0million native speakers and 180\u00a0million second-language speakers, who speak it alongside their local mother tongue, giving a total number of speakers in Indonesia of 260\u00a0million. It is common as a first language in urban areas, and as a second language by those residing in more rural parts of Indonesia. Globally, Ethnologue (2025) estimates about 80\u00a0million native speakers and 180.2\u00a0million second-language speakers, for a total of 260\u00a0million.\nThe VOA and BBC use Indonesian as one of their standard language for broadcasting. In Australia, Indonesian is one of three Asian target languages, together with Japanese and Mandarin, taught in some schools as part of the Languages Other Than English programme. Indonesian has been taught in Australian schools and universities since the 1950s.\nIn East Timor, which was occupied by Indonesia between 1975 and 1999, Indonesian is recognized by the constitution as one of the two working languages (the other being English), alongside the official languages of Tetum and Portuguese.\nIndonesian as a foreign language.\nIndonesian is taught as a foreign language in schools, universities and institutions around the world, especially in Australia, the Netherlands, Japan, South Korea, Timor-Leste, Vietnam, Taiwan, the United States, and the United Kingdom.\nAs the national language of a majority-Muslim country, Indonesian unites diverse communities and reflects broader traditions of religious tolerance and peaceful coexistence. Its vocabulary, drawing from Arabic, local languages, and colonial histories, stands as a marker of Indonesia's inclusive, pluralistic society.\nOfficial status.\nIndonesian is the official language of Indonesia, and its use is encouraged throughout the Indonesian archipelago. It is regulated in Chapter XV, 1945 Constitution of Indonesia about the flag, official language, coat of arms, and national anthem of Indonesia. Also, in Chapter III, Section 25 to 45, Government regulation No. 24/ 2009 mentions explicitly the status of the Indonesian language.&lt;ref name=\"UU No 24/2009\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The national language is Indonesian.\u2014\u200a\nIndonesian functions as a symbol of national identity and pride, and is a \"lingua franca\" among the diverse ethnic groups in Indonesia and the speakers of vernacular Malay dialects and Malay creoles. The Indonesian language serves as the national and official language, the language of education, communication, transaction and trade documentation, the development of national culture, science, technology, and mass media. It also serves as a vehicle of communication among the provinces and different regional cultures in the country.\nAccording to Indonesian law, the Indonesian language was proclaimed as the unifying language during the Youth Pledge on 28 October 1928 and developed further to accommodate the dynamics of Indonesian civilization. As mentioned previously, the language was based on Riau Malay, though linguists note that this is not the local dialect of Riau, but the Malaccan dialect that was used in the Riau court. Since its conception in 1928 and its official recognition in the 1945 Constitution, the Indonesian language has been loaded with a nationalist political agenda to unify Indonesia (former Dutch East Indies). This status has made it relatively open to accommodate influences from other Indonesian ethnic languages, most notably Javanese as the majority ethnic group, and Dutch as the previous coloniser. Compared to the indigenous dialects of Malay spoken in Sumatra and Malay peninsula or the normative Malaysian standard, the Indonesian language differs profoundly by a large number of Javanese loanwords incorporated into its already-rich vocabulary. As a result, Indonesian has more extensive sources of loanwords, compared to Malaysian Malay.\nThe disparate evolution of Indonesian and Malaysian has led to a rift between the two standardized varieties. This has been based more upon political nuance and the history of their standardization than cultural reasons, and as a result, there are asymmetrical views regarding each other's variety among Malaysians and Indonesians. Malaysians tend to assert that Malaysian and Indonesian are merely different normative varieties of the same language, while Indonesians tend to treat them as separate, albeit closely related, languages. Consequently, Indonesians feel little need to harmonise their language with Malaysia and Brunei, whereas Malaysians are keener to coordinate the evolution of the language with Indonesians, although the 1972 Indonesian alphabet reform was seen mainly as a concession of Dutch-based Indonesian to the English-based spelling of Malaysian.\nIn November 2023, the Indonesian language was recognised as one of the official languages of the UNESCO General Conference. Currently there are 10 official languages of the UNESCO General Conference, consisting of the six United Nations languages, namely English, French, Arabic, Chinese, Russian, and Spanish, as well as four other languages of UNESCO member countries, namely Hindi, Italian, Portuguese, and Indonesian.\nOfficial policy.\nAs regulated by Indonesian state law UU No 24/2009, other than state official speeches and documents between or issued to Indonesian government, Indonesian language is required by law to be used in:\nHowever, other languages may be used in dual-language setting to accompany but not to replace Indonesian language in: agreements, information regarding goods / services, scientific papers, information through mass media, geographical names, public signs, road signs, public facilities, banners, and other information of public services in public area.\nWhile there are no sanctions of the uses of other languages, in Indonesian court's point of view, any agreements made in Indonesia but not drafted in Indonesian language, is null and void. In any different interpretations in dual-language agreements setting, Indonesian language shall prevail.\nPhonology.\nVowels.\nIndonesian has six vowel phonemes as shown in the table below.\nIn standard Indonesian orthography, the Latin alphabet is used, and five vowels are distinguished: \"a, i, u, e, o\". In materials for learners, the mid-front vowel /e/ is sometimes represented with a diacritic as \u27e8\u00e9\u27e9 to distinguish it from the mid-central vowel \u27e8\u00ea\u27e9 /\u0259/. Since 2015, the auxiliary graphemes \u27e8\u00e9\u27e9 and \u27e8\u00e8\u27e9 are used respectively for phonetic [] and [] in Indonesian, while Standard Malay has rendered both of them as \u27e8\u00e9\u27e9.\nThe phonetic realization of the mid vowels // and // ranges from close-mid (/) to open-mid (/) allophones. Some analyses set up a system which treats the open-mid vowels and as distinct phonemes. Poedjosoedarmo argued the split of the front mid vowels in Indonesian is due to Javanese influence which exhibits a difference between \u27e8i\u27e9 [], \u27e8\u00e9\u27e9 [] and \u00e8 []. Another example of Javanese influence in Indonesian is the split of back mid vowels into two allophones of [] and []. These splits (and loanwords) increase instances of doublets in Indonesian, such as \u27e8\"satai\"\u27e9 and \u27e8\"sat\u00e9\"\u27e9. Javanese words adopted into Indonesian have greatly increased the frequency of Indonesian \u27e8\u00e9\u27e9 and \u27e8o\u27e9.\nIn traditional Malay, high vowels (\u27e8i\u27e9, \u27e8u\u27e9) could not appear in a final syllable if a mid-vowel (\u27e8e\u27e9, \u27e8o\u27e9) appeared in the previous syllable, and conversely, mid-vowels (\u27e8e\u27e9, \u27e8o\u27e9) could not appear in the final syllable if a high vowel (\u27e8i\u27e9, \u27e8u\u27e9) appeared in the previous syllable.\nTraditional Malay does not allow the mid-central schwa vowel to occur in consonant open or closed word-final syllables. The schwa vowel was introduced in closed syllables under the influence of Javanese and Jakarta Malay, but Dutch borrowings made it more acceptable. Although Alisjahbana argued against it, insisting on writing \u27e8a\u27e9 instead of an \u27e8\u00ea\u27e9 in final syllables such as \"koda\" (vs \"kode\" 'code') and nasionalisma (vs \"nasionalisme\" 'nationalism'), he was unsuccessful. This spelling convention was instead survived in Balinese orthography.\nDiphthongs.\nIndonesian has four diphthong phonemes only in open syllables. They are:\nSome analyses assume that these diphthongs are actually a monophthong followed by an approximant, so \u27e8ai\u27e9 represents , \u27e8au\u27e9 represents , and \u27e8oi\u27e9 represents . On this basis, there are no phonological diphthongs in Indonesian.\nDiphthongs are differentiated from two vowels in two syllables, such as:\nConsonants.\nThe consonants of Indonesian are shown above. Non-native consonants that only occur in borrowed words, principally from Arabic and English, are shown in parentheses. Some analyses list 19 \"primary consonants\" for Indonesian as the 18 symbols that are not in parentheses in the table as well as the glottal stop . The secondary consonants /f/, /v/, /z/, /\u0283/ and /x/ only appear in loanwords. Only small amounts of speakers pronounce /v/ in loanwords as [v], most of them pronounce them as [f]. Likewise, /x/ is mostly replaced with [h] or [k] by some speakers. /\u0283/ is sometimes replaced with /s/, which was traditionally used as a substitute for /\u0283/ in older borrowings from Sanskrit, and /f/ is rarely replaced, though /p/ was substituted for /f/ in older borrowings such as kopi \"coffee\" from Dutch koffie. /z/ may occasionally be replaced with /s/ or /d\u0361\u0292/. [z] can also be an allophone of /s/ before voiced consonants. According to some analyses, postalveolar affricates and are instead palatals and in Indonesian.\nThe consonants in Indonesian are influenced by other important languages in Indonesian history. The influences included schwa in final closed syllable (e.g. Indonesian p\u0259c\u0259l vs Malay p\u0259cal), initial homorganic nasal stop clusters of \u27e8mb\u27e9, \u27e8nd\u27e9, and \u27e8nj\u27e9 (e.g. Indonesian \"mbolos\" 'to malinger'), the consonant-semivowel clusters (e.g. Indonesian \"pria\" vs Malay \"p\u0259ria\" 'male'), introduction of consonant clusters \u27e8-ry-\u27e9 and \u27e8-ly-\u27e9 (e.g. Indonesian \"g\u0259rilya\" vs Malay \"g\u0259rila\" 'guerrilla'), increased usage of initial \u27e8w-\u27e9 (e.g. \"warta\" and \"b\u0259rita\" 'news') and intervocalic \u27e8w-\u27e9, and increase of initial and post-consonant \u27e8y\u27e9 [j]. These changes resulted from influences of local languages in Indonesia, such as Balinese, Madurese, Sundanese and especially Javanese, and foreign languages such as Arabic and Dutch.\nOrthographic note:\nThe sounds are represented orthographically by their symbols as above, except:\nStress.\nIndonesian has light stress that falls on either the final or penultimate syllable, depending on regional variations as well as the presence of the schwa () in a word. It is generally the penultimate syllable that is stressed, unless its vowel is a schwa . If the penult has a schwa, then stress usually moves to the final syllable.\nHowever, there is some disagreement among linguists over whether stress is phonemic (unpredictable), with some analyses suggesting that there is no underlying stress in Indonesian.\nRhythm.\nThe classification of languages based on rhythm can be problematic. Nevertheless, acoustic measurements suggest that Indonesian has more syllable-based rhythm than British English, even though doubts remain about whether the syllable is the appropriate unit for the study of Malay prosody.\nGrammar.\nWord order in Indonesian is generally subject-verb-object (SVO), similar to that of most modern European languages as well as English. However, considerable flexibility in word ordering exists, in contrast with languages such as Japanese or Korean, for instance, which always end clauses with verbs. Indonesian, while allowing for relatively flexible word orderings, does not mark for grammatical case, nor does it make use of grammatical gender.\nAffixes.\nIndonesian words are composed of a root or a root plus derivational affixes. The root is the primary lexical unit of a word and is usually bisyllabic, of the shape CV(C)CV(C). Affixes are \"glued\" onto roots (which are either nouns or verbs) to alter or expand the primary meaning associated with a given root, effectively generating new words, for example, (to cook) may become (cooking), (cook for), (be cooked), (a cook), (a meal, cookery), (accidentally cooked). There are four types of affixes: prefixes (), suffixes (), circumfixes () and infixes (). Affixes are categorized into noun, verb, and adjective affixes. Many initial consonants alternate in the presence of prefixes: (to sweep) becomes (sweeps/sweeping); (to call) becomes (calls/calling), (to sieve) becomes (sieves).\nOther examples of the use of affixes to change the meaning of a word can be seen with the word (to teach):\n\"-Kan\" and \"-i\" both increase the valency of verbs, but \"-i\" should be used \"if [the verb] is directly followed by an animate object.\"\nNoun affixes.\nNoun affixes are affixes that form nouns upon addition to root words. The following are examples of noun affixes:\nThe prefix drops its before and frequently before In some words it is ; though formally distinct, these are treated as variants of the same prefix in Indonesian grammar books.\nVerb affixes.\nSimilarly, verb affixes in Indonesian are attached to root words to form verbs. In Indonesian, there are:\nAdjective affixes.\nAdjective affixes are attached to root words to form adjectives:\nIn addition to these affixes, Indonesian also has a lot of borrowed affixes from other languages such as Sanskrit, Arabic and English. For example, \"maha-\", \"pasca-\", \"eka-\", \"bi-\", \"anti-\", \"pro-\" etc.\nNouns.\nCommon derivational affixes for nouns are peng-/per-/juru- (actor, instrument, or someone characterized by the root), -an (collectivity, similarity, object, place, instrument), ke-...-an (abstractions and qualities, collectivities), per-/peng-...-an (abstraction, place, goal or result).\nGender.\nIndonesian does not make use of grammatical gender, and there are only selected words that use natural gender. For instance, the same word is used for \"he/him\" and \"she/her\" ( or ) or for \"his\" and \"her\" (, or ). No real distinction is made between \"girlfriend\" and \"boyfriend\", both of which can be referred to as (although more colloquial terms as girl/girlfriend and boy/boyfriend can also be found). A majority of Indonesian words that refer to people generally have a form that does not distinguish between the natural genders. However, unlike English, distinction is made between older or younger.\nThere are some words that have gender: for instance, means \"daughter\" while means \"son\"; means \"male flight attendant\" while means \"female flight attendant\". Another example is , which means \"sportsman\", versus , meaning \"sportswoman\". Often, words like these (or certain suffixes such as \"-a\" and \"-i\" or \"-wan\" and \"wati\") are absorbed from other languages (in these cases, from Sanskrit).\nIn some regions of Indonesia such as Sumatra and Jakarta, (a gender-specific term meaning \"older brother\") is commonly used as a form of address for older siblings/males, while (a non-gender specific term meaning \"older sibling\") is often used to mean \"older sister\". Similarly, more direct influences from other languages, such as Javanese and Chinese, have also seen further use of other gendered words in Indonesian. For example: (\"older brother\"), (\"older sister\"), (\"older brother\") and (\"older sister\").\nNumber.\nIndonesian grammar does not regularly mark plurals. In Indonesian, to change a singular into a plural one either repeats the word or adds before it (the latter for living things only); for example, \"students\" can be either or . Plurals are rarely used in Indonesian, especially in informal parlance. Reduplication is often mentioned as the formal way to express the plural form of nouns in Indonesian; however, in informal daily discourse, speakers of Indonesian usually use other methods to indicate the concept of something being \"more than one\". Reduplication may also indicate the conditions of variety and diversity as well, and not simply plurality.\nReduplication is commonly used to emphasise plurality; however, reduplication has many other functions. For example, means \"(all the) people\", but means \"scarecrow\". Similarly, while means \"heart\" or \"liver\", is a verb meaning \"to be careful\". Also, not all reduplicated words are inherently plural, such as \"scarecrow/scarecrows\", \"a/some sheep\" and \"butterfly/butterflies\". Some reduplication is rhyming rather than exact, as in \"(all sorts of) vegetables\".\nDistributive affixes derive mass nouns that are effectively plural: \"tree\", \"flora, trees\"; \"house\", \"housing, houses\"; \"mountain\", \"mountain range, mountains\".\nQuantity words come before the noun: \"a thousand people\", \"a series of mountain ranges\", \"some butterflies\".\nPlural in Indonesian serves just to explicitly mention the number of objects in sentence. For example, (Ani buys one kilogram of mangoes). In this case, \"mangoes\", which is plural, is not said as because the plurality is implicit: the amount a kilogram means more than one mango rather than one giant mango. So, as it is logically, one does not change the singular into the plural form, because it is not necessary and considered a pleonasm (in Indonesian often called ).\nPronouns.\nPersonal pronouns are not a separate part of speech, but a subset of nouns. They are frequently omitted, and there are numerous ways to say \"you\". Commonly the person's name, title, title with name, or occupation is used (\"does Johnny want to go?\", \"would Madam like to go?\"); kin terms, including fictive kinship, are extremely common. However, there are also dedicated personal pronouns, as well as the demonstrative pronouns \"this, the\" and \"that, the\".\nPersonal pronouns.\nFrom the perspective of a European language, Indonesian boasts a wide range of different pronouns, especially to refer to the addressee (the so-called second person pronouns). These are used to differentiate several parameters of the person they are referred to, such as the social rank and the relationship between the addressee and the speaker. Indonesian also exhibits pronoun avoidance, often preferring kinship terms and titles over pronouns, particularly for respectful forms of address.\nThe table below provides an overview of the most commonly and widely used pronouns in the Indonesian language:\nNotable among the personal-pronoun system is a distinction between two forms of \"we\": \"kita\" (you and me, you and us) and \"kami\" (us, but not you). The distinction is not always followed in colloquial Indonesian.\n\"Saya\" and \"aku\" are the two major forms of \"I\". \"Saya\" is the more formal form, whereas \"aku\" is used with family, friends, and between lovers. Colloquially, \"gue\" or \"gua\" (derived from Hokkien) is often used. However, this is only used when talking with close friends, and not used in family context as it is considered not polite. \"Sahaya\" is an old or literary form of \"saya\". \"Sa(ha)ya\" may also be used for \"we\", but in such cases it is usually used with \"sekalian\" or \"semua\" \"all\"; this form is ambiguous as to whether it corresponds with inclusive \"kami\" or exclusive \"kita\". Less common are \"hamba\" \"slave\", \"hamba tuan, hamba datuk\" (all extremely humble), \"beta\" (a royal addressing oneselves), \"patik\" (a commoner addressing a royal), \"kami\" (royal or editorial \"we\"), \"kita\", \"t\u0259man\", and \"kawan.\"\nThere are three common forms of \"you\", \"Anda\" (polite), \"kamu\" (familiar), and \"kalian\" \"all\" (commonly used as a plural form of you, slightly informal). \"Anda\" is used with strangers, recent acquaintances, in advertisements, in business, and when you wish to show distance, while \"kamu\" is used in situations where the speaker would use \"aku\" for \"I\". Colloquially, \"lu\" (derived from Hokkien) is often used among close friends, just like how \"gue\" or \"gua\" is used when referring to \"I\". \"Anda sekalian\" is polite plural. Particularly in conversation, respectful titles like \"Bapak/Pak\" \"father\" (used for any older male), \"Ibu/Bu\" \"mother\" (any older woman), and \"tuan\" \"sir\" are often used instead of pronouns.\n\"Engkau\" (\"\u0259ngkau\"), commonly shortened to \"kau\".\nThe common word for \"s/he\" and \"they\" is \"ia\", which has the object and emphatic/focused form \"dia\". \"B\u0259liau\" \"his/her Honour\" is respectful. As with \"you\", names and kin terms are extremely common. \"Mereka\" \"someone\", \"mereka itu\", or \"orang itu\" \"those people\" are used for \"they\".\nThere are a large number of other words for \"I\" and \"you\", many regional, dialectical, or borrowed from local languages. \"Saudara\" \"you\" (male) and \"saudari\" (female) (plural \"saudara-saudara\" or \"saudari-saudari\") show utmost respect. \"Daku\" \"I\" and \"dikau\" \"you\" are poetic or romantic. Indonesian \"gua\" \"I\" (from Hokkien ) and \"lu\" \"you\" () are slang and extremely informal.\nThe pronouns \"aku, kamu, engkau, ia, kami,\" and \"kita\" are indigenous to Indonesian.\nPossessive pronouns.\n\"Aku, kamu, engkau\", and \"ia\" have short possessive enclitic forms. All others retain their full forms like other nouns, as does emphatic \"dia\": \"meja saya, meja kita, meja anda, meja dia\" \"my table, our table, your table, his/her table\".\nThere are also proclitic forms of \"aku\", \"ku-\" and \"kau-\". These are used when there is no emphasis on the pronoun:\n\"Kudengar raja itu menderita penyakit kulit. Aku mengetahui ilmu kedokteran. Akulah yang akan mengobati dia.\"\n\"It has come to my attention that the King has a skin disease. I am skilled in medicine. \"I\" will cure him.\"\nHere \"ku-\"verb is used for a general report, \"aku\" verb is used for a factual statement, and emphatic \"aku-lah meng-\"verb (\u2248 \"I am the one who...\") for focus on the pronoun.\nThe suffix \"-nya\" is a special case: it can be also used to mark definiteness, or to link two nouns in possession (his genitive). It is also even extended to pronouns and names. However, this usage has been occasionally criticized.\nDemonstrative pronouns.\nThere are two demonstrative pronouns in Indonesian. \"Ini\" \"this, these\" is used for a noun which is generally near to the speaker. \"Itu\" \"that, those\" is used for a noun which is generally far from the speaker. Either may sometimes be equivalent to English \"the\". There is no difference between singular and plural. However, plural can be indicated through duplication of a noun followed by a \"ini\" or \"itu\". The word \"yang\" \"which\" is often placed before demonstrative pronouns to give emphasis and a sense of certainty, particularly when making references or enquiries about something/ someone, like English \"this one\" or \"that one\".\nVerbs.\nVerbs are not inflected for person or number, and they are not marked for tense; tense is instead denoted by time adverbs (such as \"yesterday\") or by other tense indicators, such as \"sudah\" \"already\" and \"belum\" \"not yet\". On the other hand, there is a complex system of verb affixes to render nuances of meaning and to denote voice or intentional and accidental moods. Some of these affixes are ignored in colloquial speech.\nExamples of these are the prefixes \"di-\" (patient focus, traditionally called \"passive voice\", with OVA word order in the third person, and OAV in the first or second persons), \"meng-\" (agent focus, traditionally called \"active voice\", with AVO word order), \"memper-\" and \"diper-\" (causative, agent and patient focus), \"ber-\" (stative or habitual; intransitive VS order), and \"ter-\" (agentless actions, such as those which are involuntary, sudden, stative or accidental, for VA = VO order); the suffixes \"-kan\" (causative or benefactive) and \"-i\" (locative, repetitive, or exhaustive); and the circumfixes \"ber-...-an\" (plural subject, diffuse action) and \"ke-...-an\" (unintentional or potential action or state).\nForms in \"ter-\" and \"ke-...-an\" are often equivalent to adjectives in English.\nNegation.\nFour words are used for negation in Indonesian, namely \"tidak\", \"bukan\", \"jangan\", and \"belum\".\nFor example:\nProhibition.\nFor negating imperatives or advising against certain actions in Indonesian, the word \"jangan\" (do not) is used before the verb. For example,\nDon't leave me here!\nDon't do that!\nDon't! That's not good for you.\nAdjectives.\nThere are grammatical adjectives in Indonesian. Stative verbs are often used for this purpose as well. Adjectives are always placed after the noun that they modify. \nTo say that something \"is\" an adjective, the determiners \"itu\" and \"ini\" (\"that\" and \"this\") are often used. For example, in the sentence \"anjing itu galak\", the use of \"itu\" gives a meaning of \"the/that dog is ferocious\", while \"anjing ini galak\", gives a meaning of \"this dog is ferocious\". However, if \"itu\" or \"ini\" were not to be used, then \"anjing galak\" would only mean \"ferocious dog\", a plain adjective without any stative implications. The all-purpose determiner, \"yang\", is also often used before adjectives, hence \"anjing yang galak\" also means \"ferocious dog\" or more literally \"dog which is ferocious\"; \"yang\" will often be used for clarity. Hence, in a sentence such as \"saya didekati oleh anjing galak\" which means \"I was approached by a ferocious dog\", the use of the adjective \"galak\" is not stative at all.\nOften the \"ber-\" intransitive verb prefix, or the \"ter-\" stative prefix is used to express the meaning of \"to be...\". For example, \"beda\" means \"different\", hence \"berbeda\" means \"to be different\"; \"awan\" means \"cloud\", hence \"berawan\" means \"cloudy\". Using the \"ter-\" prefix, implies a state of being. For example, \"buka\" means \"open\", hence \"terbuka\" means \"is opened\"; \"tutup\" means \"closed/shut\", hence \"tertutup\" means \"is closed/shut\".\nWord order.\nAdjectives, demonstrative determiners, and possessive determiners follow the noun they modify.\nIndonesian does not have a grammatical subject in the sense that English does. In intransitive clauses, the noun comes before the verb. When there is both an agent and an object, these are separated by the verb (OVA or AVO), with the difference encoded in the voice of the verb. OVA, commonly but inaccurately called \"passive\", is the basic and most common word order.\nEither the agent or object or both may be omitted. This is commonly done to accomplish one of two things:\nFor example, a polite shop assistant in a store may avoid the use of pronouns altogether and ask:\nFor example, a friend may enquire as to when you bought your property, to which you may respond:\nUltimately, the choice of voice and therefore word order is a choice between actor and patient and depends quite heavily on the language style and context.\nEmphasis.\nWord order is frequently modified for focus or emphasis, with the focused word usually placed at the beginning of the clause and followed by a slight pause (a break in intonation):\nThe last two are more likely to be encountered in speech than in writing.\nMeasure words.\nAnother distinguishing feature of Indonesian is its use of measure words, also called classifiers (\"kata penggolong\"). In this way, it is similar to many other languages of Asia, including Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Thai, Burmese, and Bengali.\nMeasure words are also found in English such as \"two head of cattle\" or \"a loaf of bread\", where \"*two cattle\" and \"a bread\" would be ungrammatical. The word \"satu\" reduces to \"se-\" , as it does in other compounds:\n\"Example\":\nMeasure words are not necessary just to say \"a\": \"burung\" \"a bird, birds\". Using \"se-\" plus a measure word is closer to English \"one\" or \"a certain\":\n\"Ada seekor burung yang bisa berbicara\"\n\"There was a (certain) bird that could talk\"\nWriting system.\nIndonesian is written with the Latin script. It was originally based on the Dutch spelling and still bears some similarities to it. Consonants are represented in a way similar to Italian, although \u27e8c\u27e9 is always (like English \u27e8ch\u27e9), \u27e8g\u27e9 is always (\"hard\") and \u27e8j\u27e9 represents as it does in English. In addition, \u27e8ny\u27e9 represents the palatal nasal , \u27e8ng\u27e9 is used for the velar nasal (which can occur word-initially), \u27e8sy\u27e9 for (English \u27e8sh\u27e9) and \u27e8kh\u27e9 for the voiceless velar fricative . Both and are represented with \u27e8e\u27e9.\nSpelling changes in the language that have occurred since Indonesian independence include:\nIntroduced in 1901, the \"van Ophuijsen\" system (named from the advisor of the system, Charles Adriaan van Ophuijsen) was the first standardization of romanized spelling. It was most influenced by the then current Dutch spelling system and based on the dialect of Malay spoken in Johor.92 In 1947, the spelling was changed into \"Republican Spelling\" or \"Soewandi Spelling\" (named by at the time Minister of Education, Soewandi). This spelling changed formerly spelled \"oe\" into \"u\" (however, the spelling influenced other aspects in orthography, for example writing reduplicated words). All of the other changes were a part of the Perfected Spelling System, an officially mandated spelling reform in 1972. Some of the old spellings (which were derived from Dutch orthography) do survive in proper names; for example, the name of a former president of Indonesia is still sometimes written \"Soeharto\", and the central Java city of Yogyakarta is sometimes written \"Jogjakarta\". In time, the spelling system is further updated and the latest update of Indonesian spelling system issued on 16 August 2022 by Head of Language Development and Fostering Agency decree No 0424/I/BS.00.01/2022.\nLetter names and pronunciations.\nThe Indonesian alphabet is exactly the same as in ISO basic Latin alphabet.\nIndonesian follows the letter names of the Dutch alphabet. Indonesian alphabet has a phonemic orthography; words are spelled the way they are pronounced, with few exceptions. The letters Q, V and X are rarely encountered, being chiefly used for writing loanwords.\nIn addition, there are digraphs that are not considered separate letters of the alphabet:\nVocabulary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs a modern variety of Malay, Indonesian has been influenced by other languages, including Dutch, English, Greek (where the name of the country, Indonesia, comes from), Arabic, Chinese, Portuguese, Sanskrit, Tamil, Hindi, and Persian. The vast majority of Indonesian words, however, come from the root lexical stock of Austronesian (including Old Malay).\nThe study of Indonesian etymology and loan words reveals both its historical and social contexts. Examples are the early Sanskrit borrowings from the 7th century during the trading era, the borrowings from Arabic and Persian during the time of the establishment of Islam in particular, and those from Dutch during the colonial period. Linguistic history and cultural history are clearly linked.\nList of loan words of Indonesian language published by the \"Badan Pengembangan Bahasa dan Perbukuan\" (The Language Center) under the Ministry of Education and Culture:\nNote: This list only lists foreign languages, thus omitting numerous local languages of Indonesia that have also been major lexical donors, such as Javanese, Sundanese, Betawi, etc.\nLoan words of Sanskrit origin.\nThe Sanskrit influence came from contacts with India since ancient times. The words were either borrowed directly from India or with the intermediary of the Old Javanese language. Although Hinduism and Buddhism are no longer the major religions of Indonesia, Sanskrit, which was the language vehicle for these religions, is still held in high esteem and is comparable with the status of Latin in English and other Western European languages. Sanskrit is also the main source for neologisms, which are usually formed from Sanskrit roots. The loanwords from Sanskrit cover many aspects of religion, art and everyday life.\nFrom Sanskrit came such words as \u0938\u094d\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0917 \"surga\" (heaven), \u092d\u093e\u0937\u093e \"bahasa\" (language), \u0915\u093e\u091a \"kaca\" (glass, mirror), \u0930\u093e\u091c- \"raja\" (king), \u092e\u0928\u0941\u0937\u094d\u092f \"manusia\" (mankind), \u091a\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0924\u093e \"cinta\" (love), \u092d\u0942\u092e\u093f \"bumi\" (earth), \u092d\u0941\u0935\u0928 \"buana\" (world), \u0906\u0917\u092e \"agama\" (religion), \u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0940 \"Istri\" (wife/woman), \u091c\u092f \"Jaya\" (victory/victorious), \u092a\u0941\u0930 \"Pura\" (city/temple/place) \u0930\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0938 \"Raksasa\" (giant/monster), \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e \"Dharma\" (rule/regulations), \u092e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930 \"Mantra\" (words/poet/spiritual prayers), \u0915\u094d\u0937\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092f \"Satria\" (warrior/brave/soldier), \u0935\u093f\u091c\u092f \"Wijaya\" (greatly victorious/great victory), etc. Sanskrit words and sentences are also used in names, titles, and mottos of the Indonesian National Police and Indonesian Armed Forces such as: \"Bhayangkara\", \"Laksamana\", \"Jatayu\", \"Garuda\", \"Dharmakerta Marga Reksyaka\", \"Jalesveva Jayamahe\", \"Kartika Eka Paksi\", \"Swa Bhuwana Paksa\", \"Rastra Sewakottama\", \"Yudha Siaga\", etc.\nBecause Sanskrit has long been known in the Indonesian archipelago, Sanskrit loanwords, unlike those from other languages, have entered the basic vocabulary of Indonesian to such an extent that, for many, they are no longer perceived to be foreign. Therefore, one could write a short story using mostly Sanskrit-derived words. The short story below consists of approximately 80 words in Indonesian that are all derived from Sanskrit, as well as a few native function words and affixes.\nKarena semua dibiayai menggunakan dana negara jutaan rupiah, baginda maharaja bijaksana, sang mahaguru sastra bahasa Kawi, mahasiswa-mahasiswi perguruan swasta, duta-duta negeri mitra dan suami/istrinya, Menteri Kebudayaan dan Pariwisata, karyawan-karyawati perusahaan ketenagakerjaan, bupati budiman, beserta anggota lembaga nirlaba kewanitaan segera berdarmawisata ke kawasan pedesaan di utara kota kabupaten Probolinggo antara candi-candi purba berarca dan berprasasti, berwahana pedati kuda dan keledai di kala senja, lalu bersama kepala, bendahara dan kerani desa menyaksikan para petani dan gembala yang berjiwa bersahaja serta berbudi nirmala secara sukacita dan berbahagia berupacara, seraya memerdukan suara gita-gita mantra, yang merupakan sarana pujian mereka memuja nama suci Dewi Pertiwi, atas kuasanya bersedia menganugerahi mereka karunia dan restu, cita dan cinta, sejahtera dan sentosa, menjaga jiwa raga dan harta dari segala bahaya, mala petaka dan bencana, seperti banjir dan gempa bumi.\nLoan words of Chinese origin.\nThe relationship with China has been going since the 7th century when Chinese merchants traded in some areas of the archipelago such as Riau, West Borneo, East Kalimantan, and North Maluku. As the kingdom of Srivijaya appeared and flourished, China opened diplomatic relations with the kingdom in order to secure trade and seafaring. In 922, Chinese travelers visited Kahuripan in East Java. Since the 11th century, hundreds of thousands of Chinese migrants left Mainland China and settled in many parts of Nusantara (now called Indonesia).\nThe Chinese loanwords are usually concerned with cuisine, trade or often just things exclusively Chinese. Words of Chinese origin (presented here with accompanying Hokkien/ Mandarin pronunciation derivatives as well as traditional and simplified characters) include \"loteng\", (\u6a13/\u5c64 = l\u00f3u/c\u00e9ng\u00a0\u2013 [upper] floor/ level), \"mie\" (\u9eb5 &gt; \u9762 Hokkien m\u012b\u00a0\u2013 noodles), \"lumpia\" (\u6f64\u9905 (Hokkien = l\u016bn-pi\u00e1\u207f)\u00a0\u2013 springroll), \"cawan\" (\u8336\u7897 ch\u00e1w\u01cen\u00a0\u2013 teacup), \"teko\" (\u8336\u58fa &gt; \u8336\u58f6 = ch\u00e1h\u00fa [Mandarin], teh-ko [Hokkien] = teapot), \u82e6\u529b kuli (= \u82e6 khu (hard) and \u529b li (energy) \u2013 coolie) and even the widely used slang terms \"gua\" and \"lu\" (from the Hokkien 'goa' \u6211 and 'lu/li' \u6c5d\u00a0\u2013 meaning 'I/ me' and 'you').\nLoan words of Arabic origin.\nMany Arabic words were brought and spread by merchants from Arab Peninsula like Arabian, Persian, and from the western part of India, Gujarat where many Muslims lived. As a result, many Indonesian words come from the Arabic language. Especially since the late 12th century, Old Malay was heavily influenced by the language and produced many great literary works such as Syair, Babad, Hikayat, and Suluk. This century is known as \"The Golden Age of Indonesian Literature\".\nMany loanwords from Arabic are mainly concerned with religion, in particular with Islam, and by extension, with greetings such as the word, \"selamat\" (from ' = health, soundness) means \"safe\" or \"lucky\". Words of Arabic origin include \"dunia\" (from ' = the present world), names of days (except \"Minggu\"), such as \"Sabtu\" (from ' = Saturday), \"iklan\" ( ' = advertisement), \"kabar\" ( ' = news), \"Kursi\" ( ' = a chair), \"ijazah\" ( ' = 'permission', certificate of authority, e.g. a school diploma certificate), \"kitab\" ( ' = book), \"tertib\" ( ' = order/arrangement) and \"kamus\" ( ' = dictionary). Allah (), as is mostly the case for Arabic speakers, this is the word for God even in Christian Bible translations. Many early Bible translators, when they came across some unusual Hebrew words or proper names, used the Arabic cognates. In the newer translations this practice is discontinued. They now turn to Greek names or use the original Hebrew Word. For example, the name Jesus was initially translated as Isa\" (), but is now spelt as \"Yesus\". Several ecclesiastical terms derived from Arabic still exist in Indonesian language. Indonesian word for \"bishop\" is \"uskup\" (from ' = bishop). This in turn makes the Indonesian term for archbishop \"uskup agung\" (lit.\u2009'great bishop'), which is combining the Arabic word with an Old Javanese word. The term \"imam\" (from ' = leader, prayer leader) is used to translate a Catholic priest, beside its more common association with an Islamic prayer leader. Some Protestant denominations refer to their congregation \"jemaat\" (from ' = group, a community). Even the name of the Bible in Indonesian translation is \"Alkitab\" (from \"\" = the book), which literally means \"the Book\".\nLoan words of Portuguese origin.\nAlongside Malay, Portuguese was the \"lingua franca\" for trade throughout the archipelago from the sixteenth century through to the early nineteenth century. The Portuguese were among the first westerners to sail eastwards to the \"Spice Islands\". Loanwords from Portuguese were mainly connected with articles that the early European traders and explorers brought to Southeast Asia. Indonesian words derived from Portuguese include (from = table), (from = bench), (from = closet), (from = doll), (from = window), (from = church), (from = mass), (from = Christmas), (from = Easter), (from = party), (from = dance), (from = cruise), (from = flag), (from = shoes), (from = fork), (from = shirt), (from = chariot), (from = pump), (from = picture), (from = wheel), (from = young woman), (from = school), (from = lantern), (from = priest), (from = Saint), (from = poetry), (from = cheese), (from = butter), (from = soldier), (from = although), (from = room), (from = lagoon), (from = auction), (from = company), (from = passion fruit), (from = lemon), (from = card), (from = English), (from = Saturday), (from = Sunday), etc.\nLoan words of Dutch origin.\nThe former colonial power, the Netherlands, left a sizeable amount of vocabulary that can be seen in words such as (from = police), (from = quality), (from = current), (from = smoking cigarettes), (from = corruption), (from = office), (from = zipper), (from = frontrunner), (from = transmission gear), (from = electricity current), (from = company), (from = pharmacy), (from = towel), (from = clothes iron), (from = movie theater), (from = banner), (from = short circuit), (from = uncle), (from = aunt), (from = treat) and (from = free). \nThese Dutch loanwords, and many other non-Ibero-Romance, European language loanwords that came via Dutch, cover all aspects of life. Some Dutch loanwords, having clusters of several consonants, pose difficulties to speakers of Indonesian. This problem is usually solved by insertion of the schwa. For example, Dutch &gt; (screw (n.)). One scholar argues that 25% of Indonesian words are inspired by the Dutch language.\nBefore the standardization of the language, many Indonesian words follow standard Dutch alphabet and pronunciation such as \"oe\" for vowel \"u\" or \"dj\" for consonant \"j\" [d\u0292]. As a result, Malay words are written with that orthography such as: for the word or for the word , older Indonesian generation tend to have their name written in such order as well.\nLoan words of English origin.\nMany English words were incorporated into Indonesian through globalization. Many Indonesians, however, mistake words already adopted from Dutch as words borrowed from English. Indonesian adopts English words with standardization. For example: from . However, there are several words that directly borrowed without standardization that have same meanings in English such as: \"bus\", \"data\", \"domain\", \"detail\", \"internet\", \"film\", \"golf\", \"lift\", \"monitor\", \"radio\", \"radar\", \"unit\", \"safari\", \"sonar\", \"video\", and \"riil as real\".\nOther loan words.\nModern Indonesian draws many of its words from foreign sources; there are many synonyms. For example, Indonesian has three words for \"book\", i.e. (from Sanskrit), (from Arabic) and (from Dutch ); however, each has a slightly different meaning. A is often connected with ancient wisdom or sometimes with esoteric knowledge. A derived form, means a library. A is usually a religious scripture or a book containing moral guidance. The Indonesian words for the Bible and Gospel are and , both directly derived from Arabic. The book containing the penal code is also called the . is the most common word for books.\nThere are direct borrowings from various other languages of the world, such as (from ) from Japanese, and (from ) which means dried shrimp. Many words that originally are adopted through the Dutch language today however often are mistaken as English due to the similarity in the Germanic nature of both languages. In some cases the words are replaced by English language through globalization: although the word () still literally means strawberry in Indonesian, today the usage of the word is more common. Greek words such as (from ), , (both from ), (from ) came through Dutch, Arabic and Portuguese respectively.\nIt is notable that some of the loanwords that exist in both Indonesian and Malaysian languages are different in spelling and pronunciation mainly due to how they derived their origins: Malaysian utilises words that reflect the English usage (as used by its former colonial power, the British), while Indonesian uses a Latinate form (e.g. (Malaysian) vs. (Indonesian), (Malaysian) vs. (Indonesian)).\nAcronyms and portmanteau.\nSince the time of the independence of Indonesia, Indonesian has seen a surge of neologisms which are formed as acronyms (less commonly also initialisms) or blend words.\nCommon acronyms are (, from 'Indonesian National Armed Forces'), (, from 'driving licence'), (, from 'ethnic group, religion, race, inter-group [matters]', used when referring to the background of intercommunal conflicts), (, from 'human rights').\nBlend words/portmanteau are very common in Indonesian, and have become a productive tool of word formation in both formal and colloquial Indonesian. Examples from official usage include departments and officeholders (e.g. &lt; 'Foreign Minister', &lt; 'Head of Regional Police') or names of provinces and districts ( &lt; 'North Sulawesi', &lt; 'West Java'. Other commonly used portmanteau include &lt; 'community health center', &lt; 'basic commodities' (lit.\u2009'nine basic commodities').\nLiterature.\nIndonesia hosts a variety of traditional verbal arts such as poetry, historical narratives, romances, and drama, which are expressed in local languages, but modern genres are expressed mainly in Indonesian. Some of the classic Indonesian stories include \"Sitti Nurbaya\" by Marah Rusli, \"Azab dan Sengsara\" by Merari Siregar, and \"Sengsara Membawa Nikmat\" by Tulis Sutan Sati. Modern literature like novels, short stories, stage plays, and free-form poetry has developed since the late years of the 19th century and has produced figures such as novelist Pramoedya Ananta Toer, dramatist W.S. Rendra, poet Chairil Anwar, and cinematographer Garin Nugroho. Indonesia's classic novels themselves offer insight into the local culture and traditions and the historical background before and immediately after the country gained independence. One notable example is \"Shackles\", which was written by Armijn Pane in 1940. Originally titled \"Belenggu\", it has been translated into many languages, including English and German.\nAs speakers of other languages.\nOver the past few years, interest in learning Indonesian has grown among non-Indonesians. Various universities have started to offer courses that emphasise the teaching of the language to non-Indonesians. In addition to national universities, private institutions have also started to offer courses, like the Indonesia Australia Language Foundation and the . As early as 1988, teachers of the language have expressed the importance of a standardized (also called BIPA, literally \"Indonesian Language for Foreign Speaker\") materials (mostly books), and this need became more evident during the 4th International Congress on the Teaching of Indonesian to Speakers of Other Languages held in 2001.\nSince 2013, the Indonesian embassy in the Philippines has given basic Indonesian language courses to 16 batches of Filipino students, as well as training to members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. In an interview, Department of Education Secretary Armin Luistro said that the country's government should promote Indonesian or Malay, which are related to Filipino. Thus, the possibility of offering it as an optional subject in public schools is being studied.\nThe Indonesian embassy in Washington, D.C., United States, also began offering free Indonesian language courses at the beginner and intermediate level.\nWords.\nExample.\nThe following texts are excerpts from the official translations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Indonesian along with the original declaration in English.\nEnglish: Universal Declaration of Human Rights\nAll human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.\nIndonesian: Pernyataan Umum tentang Hak Asasi Manusia\nSemua orang dilahirkan merdeka dan mempunyai martabat dan hak-hak yang sama. Mereka dikaruniai akal dan hati nurani dan hendaknya bergaul satu sama lain dalam semangat persaudaraan.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "37045", "revid": "22868608", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37045", "title": "Odoacer", "text": "Ruler of Italy (c. 433 \u2013 493)\nOdoacer (c.\u2009433 \u2013 15 March 493 AD), also spelled Odovacer or Odovacar, was a barbarian soldier and statesman from the Middle Danube who was an officer of the Roman army and deposed the Western Roman child emperor Romulus Augustulus to become the ruler of Italy (476\u2013493). Odoacer's overthrow of Romulus Augustulus is traditionally understood as marking the end of the Western Roman Empire.\nAlthough he ruled Italy, Odoacer styled himself a client of the Eastern emperor Zeno in Constantinople. He was addressed not only as but also as and patrician, the latter title granted by Zeno. In the sole surviving document from his chancery\u2014and by the consul Basilius\u2014Odoacer used the title of king. Backed by the Roman Senate, he distributed land with little resistance. Soldier unrest in 477\u2013478 caused violence, but his later reign was stable. Though an Arian, he seldom interfered in the Trinitarian state church.\nBefore becoming king, Odoacer led the revolt of Herulian, Rugian, and Scirian troops that deposed Romulus Augustulus on 4 September 476. The boy-emperor, elevated by his father Orestes less than a year earlier, never gained authority beyond central Italy. With senatorial support, Odoacer then ruled autonomously while formally recognizing both Julius Nepos and Zeno. After Nepos\u2019s murder in 480, Odoacer invaded Dalmatia, executed the conspirators, and annexed the region within two years.\nIn 484, when Illus, Eastern magister militum, sought his aid against Zeno, Odoacer invaded the emperor\u2019s western provinces. Zeno retaliated by spurring the Rugii to attack Italy, but Odoacer crushed them north of the Danube in 487\u2013488. To end the conflict, Zeno unleashed the Ostrogoth Theodoric the Great, who invaded in 489, seized most of Italy by 490, and forced Odoacer into Ravenna. After the city surrendered on 5 March 493, Theodoric invited him to a reconciliation banquet, where he murdered Odoacer and claimed the throne.\nOrigins.\nName etymology.\nThe origin of the name Odoacer, which may give indications as to his tribal affiliation, is debated. It is however traditionally derived from the Germanic components *\"auda\" (luck, possession, wealth) and *\"wakra\" (awake, vigilant, lively). It is not clear from which branch of the Germanic language family it is derived. In favour of this etymology, this form has a cognate in another Germanic language, the titular \"Eadwacer\" of the Old English poem \"Wulf and Eadwacer\" (where Old English renders the earlier Germanic sound \"au-\" as \"ea-\").\nHowever, historians Robert L. Reynolds and Robert S. Lopez explored the possibility that the name Odoacer was not Germanic, making several arguments that his ethnic background might lie elsewhere. They argue that no convincing Germanic etymology has been found for the name \"Odoacer\"; instead, they propose that it could be a form of the Turkic \"Ot-toghar\" (\"grass-born\" or \"fire-born\"), or the shorter form \"Ot-ghar\" (\"herder\"). There is also debate regarding the etymology of Edeco, the apparent name of Odoacer's father. Omeljan Pritsak considered it Turkic; others such as Peter Heather continue to consider it Germanic.\nThe name of Odoacer's apparent brother, Hunulf or Onulf, is generally accepted to be Germanic \"Hun wolf\". Reynolds and Lopez emphasized that the first part, \"hun\", although the meaning is uncertain, may refer to the Huns. Odoacer's son is given two different names in ancient sources, Thelan and Oklan. Reynolds and Lopez compare these to Turkic names: \"Thelan resembles the name borne by the khagan of the eastern Turks, Tulan, who reigned from 587 to 600 A.D. Oklan resembles closely the Turkish-Tatar word oghlan, 'youth' \".\nThe assumption that the etymology of Odoacer's name can be used to determine his ancestry or language has been criticized by historians and philologists such as Otto J. Maenchen-Helfen and Walter Pohl, who have pointed out that Germanic-speakers used Hunnic names in this period and region, and vice versa. As emphasized by Pohl, the same person could be considered Hunnic or Germanic under different circumstances, especially during the upheavals after Attila's death, and \"the ruling class of Attila's empire continued to influence tribal politics even after its collapse\".\nFather and brother.\nIn a fragment from a history of Priscus, reproduced in the 7th century by John of Antioch, Odoacer is described as a man of the Sciri, the son of Edeco (\"Idiko\"), and brother of Hunulf who killed Armatus in the eastern Roman empire. The \"Anonymus Valesianus\" agrees that his father's name was Edeko (\"Aediko\"), and refers to him leading Sciri and Heruli.\nAnother record of an Edica\u2014apparently the same person\u2014is found in Jordanes, who identified him as a leader of the Sciri along with a person named Hunuulf (presumably his son), after the fall of Attila. They were defeated by the Ostrogoths at the Battle of Bolia in Pannonia about 469.\nAn earlier Edeco (\"Edekon\") was described by Priscus as a trusted man of Attila, and ambassador to Constantinople. He escorted Priscus and other Imperial dignitaries back to Attila's camp. It is not universally accepted that this Edeco is the father of Odoacer. Priscus once calls him a Scythian, and another time a Hun. It has been argued classifications like \"Scythian\" or \"Hun\" from this period could refer to social type and lifestyle rather than an exact ethnic origin. Macbain, however, argues that Priscus was careful with such terms, and sees this as evidence that Edeco cannot be the Scirian father of Odoacer.\nEthnic affiliations.\nExcept for the fact that he was not considered Roman, Odoacer's precise ethnic origins are not known. His origins probably lie in the multi-ethnic empire of Attila, a generation earlier, which included several groups referred to in this period as \"Gothic peoples\"\u2014the same polyethnic complex which dominated the military forces that he is most famous for leading throughout his later life. On that basis, he is likely at least partly of Germanic descent. Early medieval sources such as Theophanes called him a Goth. Likewise, the 6th century chronicler Marcellinus Comes called him a \"king of the Goths\" (\"Odoacer rex Gothorum\").\nOne of the most important sources for this topic has been the 6th-century writer Jordanes, who associated him with several of the Gothic peoples who came to the Middle Danube during the time of Attila's empire, including the Sciri, Heruli, and Rugii. In several passages, Jordanes also associated Odoacer with the otherwise unknown Turcilingi\u2014who may have been a people or perhaps a dynasty. The Turcilingi are not mentioned in any other historical sources apart from those derived from Jordanes and their ethnic affiliations are unclear, but they may have been Gothic, Hunnic, or even precursors of the Thuringii. While in one passage of \"Getica\", Jordanes describes Odoacer as king of the Turcilingi () with Scirian and Heruli followers, in another passage Jordanes calls him the king of \"Torcilingi and Rugi\". In his \"Romana\", the same author defines Odoacer as a descendant of the Rugii, or of a person named Rogus, of the Turcilingi (), with Scirian and Heruli followers.\nThe Scirii and Heruls were among those known to contemporaries such as the historian Procopius as \"Gothic peoples\". They both appear to have come to the Danubian area from the direction of what is now Ukraine, as do the Goths, Huns, and Alans. The Rugii, who apparently originated on the south Baltic coast, are known from other sources for their post-Attila kingdom on the Danube. These groups fought on the same side as the Scirii in the battle of Bolia in 468, defeating the Ostrogoths, who were one of the most dominant of the post-Attila groups. It has also been pointed out by Reynolds and Lopez that Attila had an uncle named Rogus and that Jordanes may have been saying Odoacer was his descendant. After the battle of Bolia, the Scirii, Rugii and Heruli made up a large part of the military force Odoacer came to control in Italy, while the Ostrogoths moved into Eastern Roman territory in the Balkans. The near contemporary \"Auctorium Havniense\" also calls Odoacer a king of Heruli. Many historians, such as medieval scholar Michael Frassetto, accept that Odoacer was of Scirian heritage, because of the apparent family links to Edeko and Hunulf.\nOn the other hand, scholars are divided about whether Jordanes can be relied upon concerning the \"Turcilingi\". It has also been proposed that these are an otherwise unknown Turkic speaking people among the Huns. Whether or not this is accepted, there is also an argument that the Turcilingi mentioned by Jordanes were early Thuringians, who established a kingdom by about this time in what is now central Germany, relatively far to the north of the Danubian kingdoms. In favour of this argument, the 10th century \"Suda\" identifies Odoacer's apparent brother Hunulf as a Thuringian on his father's side and Scirian on his mother's side. This fragment is thought to have been written by the 5th-century historian Malchus, who was a near contemporary and likely to be well-informed.\nMuch later, a memorial plate from 1521 found in the catacombe Chapel of St Maximus in Petersfriedhof\u2014the burial site of St Peter's Abbey in Salzburg (Austria)\u2014mentions Odoacer as King of \"Rhutenes\" or \"Rhutenians\" (), who invaded Noricum in 477. Due to its very late date of 1521 and several anachronistic elements, the content of that plate is considered nothing more than a legend. In spite of that, the plate has become a popular \"source\" for several theorists that try to connect Odoacer with ancient Celtic Ruthenes, and also with later Slavic Ruthenians. Historian Paul R. Magocsi argues such theories should be regarded as \"inventive tales\" of \"creative\" writers and nothing more.\nFinally, a passage from Eugippius's \"Life of Saint Severinus\" indicated that Odoacer was so tall that he had to bend down to pass through the doorway, which historian Bruce Macbain considers another strong argument that he was unlikely to have been a Hun, as ancient sources describe the Huns as shorter than Romans.\nHistorians such as Penny MacGeorge and Macbain avow that Odoacer was likely half-Scirian and half-Thuringian. Macbain notes that \"whatever the Skirians may have been [...] no one doubts that the Thuringians were Germans\", and that while the \"ancient sources exhibit considerable confusion over Odovacer's tribal affiliation\" none of them calls Odoacer a Hun. Historian Patrick Amory explains that \"Odoacer is called a Scirian, a Rugian, a Goth or a Thuringian in sources; his father is called a Hun, his mother a Scirian. Odoacer's father Edeco was associated first with the Huns under Attila, and then with a group called Sciri, an ethnographic name that appears intermittently in fifth-century sources.\" Historian Erik Jensen also avows that Odoacer was born to a Gothic mother and that his father Edeco was a Hun.\nBefore Italy.\nJohn of Antioch reported that he was 60 years old when he died in 493, indicating a birth year of about 433.\nThere are two recorded incidents involving military leaders with the name Odoacer preserved in the \"History of the Franks\" of Gregory of Tours, using two different spellings and involving two different regions. These involve events which were early enough to be Odoacer before his appearance in Italy. Both were during the lifetime of Childeric I, king of the Franks, who died about 481. \nIn the first mention, a confused or confusing report is given of a number of battles in about 463 fought by Childeric, Aegidius, Count Paul, and one \"Adovacrius\" (with an \"a\") who was leading a group of Saxons based at the mouth of the Loire. Though there is no consensus, some historians, such as Reynolds and Lopez, have suggested that this Adovacrius may be the same person as the future king of Italy. Matthias Springer has noted that Odoacer's involvement with northern European Saxons in this period would be consistent with the proposal that he had Thuringian ancestry, pointing out that the term Saxon in this period was probably not a distinct ethnic label.\nIn a second mention by Gregory of Tours, an Odovacrius (with an \"o\") made an alliance with the same Childeric, and together they fought the Alamanni, who had been causing problems in Italy. This Odoacer, with his connection to the region north of Italy, and his \"o\" spelling, is probably the future king of Italy, before he was king.\nAnother early recorded event which is more certainly about Odoacer the future king, was shortly before he arrived in Italy. Eugippius, in his \"Life of Saint Severinus\", records how a group of barbarians on their way to Italy stopped to pay their respects to the holy man. Odoacer, at the time \"a young man, of tall figure, clad in poor clothes\", learned from Severinus that he would one day become famous. Despite the fact that Odoacer was an Arian Christian and Severinus was Catholic, the latter left a deep impression on him. When Odoacer took his leave, Severinus made one final comment which proved prophetic: \"Go to Italy, go, now covered with mean hides; soon you will make rich gifts to many.\"\nLeader of the \"foederati\".\nBy 470, Odoacer had become an officer in what remained of the Roman Army. Although Jordanes writes of Odoacer as invading Italy \"as leader of the Sciri, the Heruli and allies of various races\", modern writers describe him as being part of the Roman military establishment, based on John of Antioch's statement that Odoacer was on the side of Ricimer at the beginning of his battle with the emperor Anthemius in 472. Odoacer is said to have \"hastened the emperor's downfall\", since he switched sides to join with Ricimer. Procopius describes him as one of the Emperor's bodyguards, only agreeing to this position if placed in charge of them.\nWhen Orestes was in 475 appointed \"Magister militum\" and patrician by the Western Roman Emperor Julius Nepos, Odoacer became head of the barbarian \"foederati\" military forces of Italy. Under the command of Orestes were significant contingents of Germanic peoples made up mostly of Rugii and Heruli tribesmen. Before the end of that year Orestes had rebelled and driven Nepos from Italy. Orestes then proclaimed his young son Romulus the new emperor as Romulus Augustus, called \"Augustulus\" (31 October). At this time, Odoacer was a soldier rising through the ranks. However, Nepos reorganized his court in Salona in Dalmatia, and received homage and affirmation from the remaining fragments of the Western Empire beyond Italy and, most importantly, from Constantinople, which refused to accept Augustulus, Zeno having branded him and his father as traitors and usurpers.\nAbout this time, the \"foederati\", who had been quartered in Italy all of these years, had grown weary of this arrangement. In the words of J. B. Bury, \"They desired to have roof-trees and lands of their own, and they petitioned Orestes to reward them for their services, by granting them lands and settling them permanently in Italy\". Orestes refused their petition, and they turned to Odoacer to lead their revolt against Orestes. Orestes was killed at Placentia along with his brother Paulus outside Ravenna. The Germanic \"foederati,\" the Scirians and the Heruli, as well as a large segment of the Italic Roman army, then proclaimed Odoacer \"rex\" (\"king\") on 23 August 476. Odoacer then advanced to Ravenna and captured the city, compelling the young emperor Romulus to abdicate on 4 September. According to the \"Anonymus Valesianus\", Odoacer was moved by Romulus's youth and his beauty to not only spare his life but give him a pension of 6,000 \"solidi\" and sent him to Campania to live with his relatives.\nFollowing Romulus Augustus's deposition, according to the historian Malchus, upon hearing of the accession of Zeno to the throne, the Senate in Rome sent an embassy to the Eastern Emperor and bestowed upon him the Western imperial insignia. The message was clear: the West no longer required a separate Emperor, for \"one monarch sufficed [to rule] the world\". In response, Zeno accepted their gifts and this essentially brought to an end any puppet emperors in the West, with Nepos banished and Anthemius dead. The Eastern Emperor then conferred upon Odoacer the title of Patrician and granted him legal authority to govern Italy in the name of Rome, as \"dux Italiae\". Zeno also suggested that Odoacer should receive Nepos back as Emperor in the West, \"if he truly wished to act with justice.\" Although he accepted the title of Patrician and \"Dux\" from Zeno, Odoacer did not invite Julius Nepos to return to Rome, and the latter remained in Dalmatia until his death. Odoacer was careful to observe form, however, and made a pretence of acting on Nepos's authority, even issuing coins with both his image and that of Zeno. Following Nepos's murder in 480, who was killed while waiting in Dalmatia, Zeno became sole Emperor.\nBury, however, disagrees that Odoacer's assumption of power marked the fall of the Western Roman Empire:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It stands out prominently as an important stage in the process of the dismemberment of the Empire. It belongs to the same catalogue of chronological dates which includes A.D. 418, when Honorius settled the Goths in Aquitaine, and A.D. 435, when Valentinian ceded African lands to the Vandals. In A.D. 476 the same principle of disintegration was first applied to Italy. The settlement of Odovacar's East Germans, with Zeno's acquiescence, began the process by which Italian soil was to pass into the hands of Ostrogoths and Lombards, Franks and Normans. And Odovacar's title of king emphasised the significance of the change.\nKing of Italy.\nIn 476, Odoacer was proclaimed rex by his soldiers and \"dux Italiae\" by emperor Zeno, initiating a new administrative era over Roman lands. Odoacer introduced a few important changes to the administrative system of Italy. According to Jordanes, at the beginning of his reign he \"slew Count Bracila at Ravenna that he might inspire a fear of himself among the Romans.\" He took many military actions to strengthen his control over Italy and its neighbouring areas. He achieved a solid diplomatic coup by inducing the Vandal king Gaiseric to cede Sicily to him. Noting that \"Odovacar seized power in August of 476, Gaiseric died in January 477, and the sea usually became closed to navigation around the beginning of November\", F. M. Clover dates this cession to September or October 476. When Julius Nepos was murdered by two of his retainers in his country house near Salona (9 May 480), Odoacer assumed the duty of pursuing and executing the assassins, and at the same time established his own rule in Dalmatia.\nAs Bury points out, \"It is highly important to observe that Odovacar established his political power with the co-operation of the Roman Senate, and this body seems to have given him their loyal support throughout his reign, so far as our meagre sources permit us to draw inferences.\" He regularly nominated members of the Senate to the Consulate and other prestigious offices: \"Basilius, Decius, Venantius, and Manlius Boethius held the consulship and were either Prefects of Rome or Praetorian Prefects; Symmachus and Sividius were consuls and Prefects of Rome; another senator of old family, Cassiodorus, was appointed a minister of finance.\" A. H. M. Jones also notes that under Odoacer the Senate acquired \"enhanced prestige and influence\" in order to counter any desires for restoration of Imperial rule. As the most tangible example of this renewed prestige, for the first time since the mid-3rd century copper coins were issued with the legend \"S(enatus) C(onsulto)\". Jones describes these coins as \"fine big copper pieces\", which were \"a great improvement on the miserable little hitherto current\", and not only were they copied by the Vandals in Africa, but they formed the basis of the currency reform by Anastasius in the Eastern Empire.\nAlthough Odoacer was an Arian Christian, his relations with the Chalcedonian church hierarchy were remarkably good. As G. M. Cook notes in her introduction to Magnus Felix Ennodius's \"Life of Saint Epiphanius\", he showed great esteem for Bishop Epiphanius: in response to the bishop's petition, Odoacer granted the inhabitants of Liguria a five-year immunity from taxes, and again granted his requests for relief from abuses by the praetorian prefect. The biography of Pope Felix III in the openly states that the pontiff's tenure occurred during Odoacer's reign without any complaints about the king being registered.\nIn 487/488, Odoacer led his army to victory against the Rugians in Noricum, taking their king Feletheus into captivity; when word that Feletheus's son, Fredericus, had returned to his people, Odoacer sent his brother Onoulphus with an army back to Noricum against him. Onoulphus found it necessary to evacuate the remaining Romans and resettled them in Italy. The remaining Rugians fled and took refuge with the Ostrogoths; the abandoned province was settled by the Lombards by 493.\nFall and death.\nAs Odoacer's position improved, Zeno, the Eastern Emperor, increasingly saw him as a rival. Odoacer exchanged messages with Illus, who had been in open revolt against Zeno since 484. Switching allegiances, Zeno subsequently sought to destroy Odoacer and then promised Theodoric the Great and his Ostrogoths the Italian peninsula if they were to defeat and remove Odoacer. As both Herwig Wolfram and Peter Heather point out, Theodoric had his own reasons to agree to this offer: \"Theodoric had enough experience to know (or at least suspect) that Zeno would not, in the long term, tolerate his independent power. When Theodoric rebelled in 485, we are told, he had in mind Zeno's treatment of Armatus. Armatus defected from Basilicus to Zeno in 476, and was made senior imperial general for life. Within a year, Zeno had him assassinated.\"\nIn 489, Theodoric led the Ostrogoths across the Julian Alps and into Italy. On 28 August, Odoacer met him at the Isonzo, only to be defeated. He withdrew to Verona, reaching its outskirts on 27 September, where he immediately set up a fortified camp. Theodoric followed him and three days later defeated him again. While Odoacer took refuge in Ravenna, Theodoric continued across Italy to Mediolanum, where the majority of Odoacer's army, including his chief general Tufa, surrendered to the Ostrogothic king. Theodoric had no reason to doubt Tufa's loyalty and dispatched his new general to Ravenna with a band of elite soldiers. Herwig Wolfram observes, \"But Tufa changed sides, the Gothic elite force entrusted to his command was destroyed, and Theodoric suffered his first serious defeat on Italian soil.\" Theodoric recoiled by seeking safety in Ticinum. Odoacer emerged from Ravenna and started to besiege his rival. While both were fully engaged, the Burgundians seized the opportunity to plunder and devastated Liguria. Many Romans were taken into captivity and did not regain their freedom until Theodoric ransomed them three years later.\nThe following summer, the Visigothic king Alaric II demonstrated what Wolfram calls \"one of the rare displays of Gothic solidarity\" and sent military aid to help his kinsman, forcing Odoacer to raise his siege. Theodoric emerged from Ticinum, and on 11 August 490, the armies of the two kings clashed on the Adda River. Odoacer again was defeated and forced back into Ravenna, where Theodoric besieged him. Ravenna proved to be invulnerable, surrounded by marshes and estuaries and easily supplied by small boats from its hinterlands, as Procopius later pointed out in his \"History\". Further, Tufa remained at large in the strategic valley of the Adige near Trent, and received unexpected reinforcements when dissent amongst Theodoric's ranks led to sizable desertions. That same year, the Vandals took their turn to strike while both sides were fully engaged and invaded Sicily. While Theodoric was engaged with them, his ally Fredericus, king of the Rugians, began to oppress the inhabitants of Pavia, whom the latter's forces had been garrisoned to protect. Once Theodoric intervened in person in late August 491, his punitive acts drove Fredericus to desert with his followers to Tufa.\nBy this time, however, Odoacer appeared to have lost all hope of victory. A large-scale sortie he sent out of Ravenna on the night of 9/10 July 491 ended in failure, during which his commander-in-chief, Livilia, along with the best of his Herulian soldiers, was killed. On 29 August 492, the Goths were about to assemble enough ships at Rimini to set up an effective blockade of Ravenna. Despite these decisive losses, the war dragged on until 25 February 493 when John, bishop of Ravenna, was able to negotiate a treaty between Theodoric and Odoacer to occupy Ravenna together and share joint rule. After a three-year siege, Theodoric entered the city on 5 March. Odoacer died ten days later, slain by Theodoric while they shared a meal. Theodoric had plotted to have a group of his followers kill him while the two kings were feasting together in the imperial palace of Honorius \"Ad Laurentum\" (\"At the Laurel Grove\"); when this plan went astray, Theodoric drew his sword and struck him on the collarbone. In response to Odoacer's dying question, \"Where is God?\" Theodoric cried, \"This is what you did to my friends.\" Theodoric was said to have stood over the body of his dead rival and exclaimed, \"The man has no bones in his body.\"\nNot only did Theodoric slay Odoacer, he thereafter had the betrayed king's loyal followers hunted down and killed as well, an event which left him as the master of Italy. Odoacer's wife Sunigilda was stoned to death, and his brother Onoulphus was killed by archers while seeking refuge in a church. Theodoric exiled Odoacer's son Thela to Gaul, but when he attempted to return to Italy Theodoric had him killed. Despite the tragic ending of his domain, followers, and family, Odoacer left an important legacy, in that he had laid the foundations of a great kingdom in Italy that benefited Theodoric the Great.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "37046", "revid": "4796325", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37046", "title": "Heruli", "text": "Early Germanic people\nThe Heruli (also Eluri, Eruli, Herules, Herulians) were one of the smaller Germanic peoples of Late Antiquity, known from records in the third to sixth centuries AD. \nThe best recorded group of Heruli established a kingdom north of the Middle Danube, probably including the area north of present day Vienna. This kingdom was a neighbour to several other small and short-lived kingdoms in the late 5th century and early 6th century, including those of the Sciri, Rugii, Danubian Suebi, and Gepids. After the conquest of this Heruli kingdom by the Lombards in 508, splinter groups moved to Sweden, Ostrogothic Italy, and present-day Serbia, which was under Eastern Roman control. \nThe Danubian Heruli are generally equated to the \"Elouri\" who lived near the Sea of Azov during the late 3rd or early 4th century, and are believed to have migrated westwards. In 267-270 these Elouri took part together with Goths and other eastern European peoples in two massive raids into Roman provinces in the Balkans and Aegean Sea, attacking not only by land, but notably also by sea. The equation of these \"ELuRi\" with the \"ERuLi\" was made by several Byzantine authors, and is still widely accepted although some scholars such as Elleg\u00e5rd consider this equation uncertain, and propose that the Heruli homeland lay elsewhere. For example, because a group of 6th century Heruli moved from the Danube to Scandinavia, some scholars believe that the Heruli had their earliest origins in Scandinavia. There are also proposals that there were Heruli kingdoms in several parts of Europe, already in the 3rd and 4th century, perhaps with common origins in the north. One proposal, based upon indirect evidence, is that there was a \"Western Heruli\" settlement based near the Lower Rhine, because in 286 AD, only a few years after the eastern raids, the Heruli were defeated in an attack on Roman Gaul.\nLike their sometime allies the Goths, soon after first being noted in contemporary records as Eastern European raiders, Heruli also began entering the Roman empire and serving in its military, where they developed a particularly notable reputation already in the 4th century, at first mainly in the Western Roman Empire. A new Heruli unit was stationed in northern Italy. On the other hand, Heruli living near the Roman frontiers were also among the many groups which caused disruption to the empire in this period. The Heruli probably already settled north of the Danube in the 4th century. In 409 AD Heruli were among the \"ferocious\" nations, mostly from the Danubian area, that Saint Jerome described as occupying all of Roman Gaul. An important influence upon the movements of such peoples in this period was that the Huns were moving west. Eventually Attila's empire was based in the Danubian region. The Danubian Heruli kingdom known from later records probably already existed in some form within his empire, as did the kingdoms of the Ostrogoths, Sciri, and Gepids.\nAfter the death of Attila in 453, the Danubian Heruli fought in the Battle of Nedao in 454, although it is not certain which side they took among his various former allies. They also participated in successive conquests of Italy by Odoacer (476), Theoderic the Great (493), Narses (554), and probably also the Lombards (starting in 568). Under Roman command the Heruli played important military roles in Balkan, African, and Italian conflicts. With their last known kingdom in the Balkans eventually dominated by Rome however, and smaller groups integrated into larger political entities such as the Gepids and Lombards, the Heruli disappear from history around the time of the conquest of Italy by the Lombards. In this period the Middle Danube was coming under the control of the Pannonian Avars.\nClassification.\nWhen first mentioned by Roman authors in the 3rd century AD, the \"Elouri\" were referred to as \"Scythians\", as were the Goths and other allied tribes. The use of this term for Heruli and Goths probably began as early as Dexippus, most of whose work is now lost. The use of this term does not give us any clear linguistic classification.\nIn late antiquity, the Gepids, Vandals, Rugii, Sciri, the non-Germanic Alans, and not only the Goths themselves, were all classified by Roman ethnographers as \"Gothic\" (or \"Getic\") peoples, and modern historians generally consider the Heruli to be one of these. While historians such as Walter Goffart have pointed out that the Herules are never included in the lists of \"Gothic peoples\" of Procopius, Mihail Zahariade has pointed out that Zonaras (12.24.20) stated that the Heruli were of Gothic stock, and he suggests this might be why Latin authors did not distinguish the early Heruli from the Goths as carefully as Greek authors did.\nNone of these eastern peoples were considered \"Germanic\" by Roman ethnographers at the time. However, in modern scholarship the Heruli, like other peoples presumed to have spoken a Germanic language, are usually classified as a Germanic people. On account of having likely spoken an East Germanic language, such as Gothic, the Heruli are often more specifically classified as an East Germanic people.\nName.\nIn English, the plural \"Heruli\" can also be spelled as Heruls, Herules, or Herulians. The name can be written without \"h\" in Greek (\u1f1c\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9, 'Erouloi'), Latin (\"Eruli\"), and English. Whether or not the h in the spelling represents an organic sound is uncertain.\nIn the earliest mentions of them in 4th century records, they were called Eluri ('\u0395\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9), with the \"L\" and \"R\" reversed compared to later records. This has led to doubts about whether these first \"Erouli\" from the Sea of Azov were the same people as the later Eruli from the Danube. Dexippus whose writings about these early \"Eluri\" only survive in fragments, gave their name a Greek etymology, claiming that they were named after the swamps (\u1f15\u03bb\u03b7, \"h\u00e9l\u0113\") of their Azov homeland.\nAccording to modern scholars the etymology of the name is uncertain but it is thought to be Germanic. More speculatively, it is possibly related to the English word \"earl\" (see erilaz) implying that it was an honorific military title. (This etymology is associated with the speculation that the Heruli were not a normal tribal group but a brotherhood of mobile warriors, though there is no consensus for this old proposal, which is based only on the name etymology and the reputation of Heruli as soldiers.) \nThere have been proposals which connected this etymology with Germanic words found in runic inscriptions in Scandinavia signifying a pronunciation \"erilaR\", and there have also been proposals that the word is connected to Germanic words for werewolves and beings with magic powers. None of these proposals can be verified.\nLanguage.\nThe Heruli are believed to have spoken a Germanic language. Personal names are one of the only direct sources of evidence for this. Some attested Heruli names are almost certainly Germanic, and similar to Gothic names, but a large number are not easily attributed to any specific language family.\nGiven their association with the Goths, the Heruli may have spoken an East Germanic language, related to the Gothic language. Alternatively however, given their proposed connections to Scandinavia, it has also been proposed that they spoke a North Germanic language.\nHistory.\nPossible Scandinavian origins.\nAlthough contemporary records locate the Heruli first near the Sea of Azov, and later on the Middle Danube, their ultimate origins are traditionally sought in Scandinavia. The Heruli are thus commonly believed to have migrated from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea before the 3rd century AD. In line with this, their Black Sea neighbours the Goths, and their Danubian neighbours Rugii, are both believed to have had their origins on the southern Baltic shore, and there are proposals that their ultimate origins were in Scandinavia. The idea that they came from regions near the Baltic is consistent with the fact that many of these peoples, such as the Goths, spoke Germanic languages, and these originated near the Baltic.\nThe source of the idea that such peoples specifically came from Scandinavia is the 6th century historian Jordanes, who was based in Constantinople. He believed that the Goths and Gepids both came from Scandinavia many centuries before his time, which he described as \"like a workshop or even better the womb of nations\" (\"quasi officina gentium aut certe velut vagina nationum\"). This narrative was extremely influential for later writers. Jordanes also made specific remarks concerning the Heruli, but these have been more difficult to interpret. He said that the Heruli had been driven out of their own settlements in Scandinavia by the Danes (\"Herulos propriis sedibus expulerunt\"). This is interpreted by various scholars in at least two different ways.\nThe evidence for this second possibility is that Procopius, a contemporary of Jordanes, recounted a migration by sixth-century Heruli noblemen to Scandinavia (\"Thule\") from the Middle Danube, where their kingdom had been destroyed by the Lombards. Apparently aligning with the story of Jordanes, when other expatriates from the Danubian kingdom established themselves to the south, in the Balkans and needed a king, they sent embassy to the Scandinavian Heruli and returned with one. \nWhile a migration to Scandinavia can itself be seen as evidence of an old and continuous connection between the Heruli and Scandinavia, some scholars are sceptical of this interpretation, noting that Procopius specifically says that the Heruli who moved to Scandinavia left the \"home of their ancestors\". In contrast, in 2021 Prostko-Prosty\u0144ski argued that there is \"no doubt\" about Scandinavian origins. Even though Procopius does not explicitly mention it, \"it is hard to assume they ventured so far north without a reason of such nature\". In his review of Prostko-Prosty\u0144ski, Roland Steinacher asserts that this is debatable.\nElleg\u00e5rd, one of the scholars who argued that the expulsion involved immigrants whose real homeland was on the Danube, wrote that \"the only thing we can say with reasonable certainty is that a small group of Eruli lived there [in Scandinavia] for some 38-40 years in the first half of the 6th century AD\". \nMore controversially, Elleg\u00e5rd proposed that the evidence makes it most likely that the Heruli were \"a loose group of Germanic warriors which came into being in the late 3rd century in the region north of the Danube limes that extends roughly from Passau to Vienna\". This proposal has not been widely accepted.\nOn the Pontic-Caspian steppe.\nIn 267/268 and 269/270 Graeco-Roman writers described two major campaigns by the \"Eluri\" into the Balkans and Aegean, which were among the last and biggest such seaborne raids from the northern Black Sea coast starting in the 250s. They are normally equated to the later Danubian Heruli. Although doubts have been raised about this link, the \"Augustan History\" written in the late 4th century, Jordanes in the 6th century, and George Syncellus around 800 all equated them with the Heruli known in later times.\nDuring these raids, Goths, Eluri, and other \"Scythian\" peoples took control of Black Sea Greek cities, and gained a fleet that they used to launch raids starting in the Black Sea itself, and going as far as Greece and Asia Minor. Although some historians in the past doubted whether there were really two invasions so close together, these invasions began in the reign of Gallienus (260-268 AD), and continued until at least 269 during the reign of Marcus Aurelius Claudius, who subsequently took up the title \"Gothicus\" due to his victory.\nIn 267, a Heruli fleet departed from the Sea of Azov, past the Danube delta, and into the straits of the Bosphorus. They took control of Byzantion and Chrysopolis before retreating to the Black Sea. Emerging to raid Cyzicus, they subsequently entered the Aegean Sea, where they troubled Lemnos, Skyros and Imbros, before landing in the Peloponnese. There they plundered not only Sparta, the closest city to their landing site, but also Corinth, Argos, and the sanctuary of Zeus at Olympia. Still within 267 they reached Athens, where local militias had to defend the city. It seems to have been the Heruli specifically who sacked Athens despite the construction of a new wall, during Valerian\u2019s reign only a generation earlier. This was the occasion for a famous defense made by Dexippus, whose writings were a source for later historians.\nFurther north, in 268, Gallienus defeated Heruli at the river Nestos using a new mobile cavalry, but as part of the surrender a Herulian chief named Naulobatus became the first barbarian known from written records to receive imperial insignia from the Romans, gaining the rank of a Roman consul. It is highly likely that these defeated Heruli were then made part of the Roman military.\nRecent researchers such as Steinacher now have increased confidence that there was a distinct second campaign which began in 269, and ended in 270. Later Roman writers reported that thousands of ships left from the mouth of the Dnieper, manned by a large force of various different \"Scythian\" peoples, including Peuci, Greutungi, Austrogothi, Tervingi, Vesi, Gepids, \"Celts\", and Heruli. These forces divided into two parts in the Hellespont. One force attacked Thessaloniki, and against this group the Romans, led by Claudius now, had a major victory at the Battle of Naissus (Ni\u0161, Serbia) in 269. This was apparently a distinct battle from that at the Nessos. A Herulian chieftain named Andonnoballus is said to have switched to the Roman side, and this was once again a case where Heruli appear to have joined the Roman military. The second group sailed south and raided Rhodes, Crete, and Cyprus and many Goths and Heruli managed to return safely to harbor in the Crimea. Lesser attacks continued until 276.\nThe Heruli are believed to have formed part of the Chernyakhov culture, which, although dominated by the Goths and other Germanic peoples, also included Bastarnae, Dacians and Carpi. The Heruli are thus archaeologically indistinguishable from the Goths.\nJordanes reports that these Heruli of the Azov area in the late 4th century AD were conquered by Ermanaric, king of the Greuthungi Goths. Ermanaric's realm may also have included Finns, Slavs, Alans and Sarmatians. Before being conquered by Ermanaric, Jordanes says that the Heruli were led by a king named Alaric. Herwig Wolfram has suggested that the future Visigothic king Alaric I may have been named after this Herulian king.\nThe \"western\" Heruli of the 4th century.\nAs with their neighbours the Goths, Heruli were already seen in western Europe before the empire of Attila, both as raiders and as soldiers working under Roman authority. They first appear at the time of their first ambitious campaigns in the east. In 286 Claudius Mamertinus reported the victory of Maximian over a group of Heruli and Chaibones (known only from this one report) attacking Gaul. Further reports of the Heruli in the west continue in the 4th century and based on this there is a proposal that there was a distinct Western kingdom of Heruli living near the Lower Rhine, who were not descended from the Heruli who lived in the Black Sea. \nAlready before the time of Attila the Romans established a Herulian auxiliary unit in the Western Roman Empire, and it has been argued that this implies that they were already settled somewhere within the empire. The \"Heruli seniores\" were stationed in northern Italy. This \"numerus Erulorum\" was a lightly-equipped unit often associated with the Batavian \"Batavi seniores\". If there was ever a regiment called \"Heruli iuniores\", then it is possible it was based in the Eastern Roman empire and it may have been one of the units which ceased to exist after the Battle of Adrianople in 378.\nElleg\u00e5rd argues that the association with the Batavi in this period should be seen not as a connection to the Lower Rhine, the original home of the Batavi unit centuries earlier, but to their quarters in this period which were at Passau (\"Castra Batava\") on the Danube, not far from where the Heruli would later have their kingdom. Liccardo argues that even though \"units were moved around and over time tended to lose any ethnic or geographical homogeneity\" they could still give hints about the origins of ethnic groups.\nAt least two much later mentions of Heruli in southwestern Europe, after the Heruli were established on the Middle Danube, and in parts of Italy, can be connected to the Visigoths who had been granted a kingdom by the Romans in what is now southwestern France, but have also been taken to imply the existence of Heruli based on the North Sea coast, for example near the Lower Rhine. Firstly, two sea raids were made by Heruli around coastal Spain in the 450s, as reported by Hydatius. Secondly, shortly after 475 Sidonius Apollinaris reported the presence of Heruli at the Visigothic court of Euric in Bordeaux. They are listed in a poetic way together with other barbarians, from places as distant as Parthia, who Sidonius found looking for protection and patronage.\nParticularly striking in this passage is the implication that the Heruli homeland is on the \"Ocean\". More generally the connection of these Heruli with the sea, so far to the west, is sometimes taken as evidence that these Heruli were not from the Danube or Black Sea. Steinacher, on the other hand, argues that the poetic references of Sidonius linking the Heruli to the sea might be \"nothing more than a bookish reference to 3rd-century accounts of Herules\" who attacked from the Black Sea. Steinacher, along with fellow scholar Halsall, has pointed out that this evidence of Heruli in Visigothic territory is consistent with the conflicts within the Roman empire during this period; Halsall writes that it \"must at least be a possibility\" that the Herulian raids in Spain during this period \"constituted part of a Romano-Visigothic offensive against the Sueves\". These Suebi, themselves from central Europe, had recently established a kingdom on the northern coast of Spain, and the Visigoths coordinated with Rome against them. On the other hand, other scholars, such as Liccardo, emphasize that Sidonius lists the Herulians with Saxons, Franks and Burgundians\u2014i.e., as if they were subjects or supplicants from Gaul.\nThe 6th century correspondence of Theoderic the Great, preserved in of Cassiodorus, does not give any information about the location of the homeland of the Heruli. This leaves open the possibility that the recipient of the letter was the Middle Danubian kingdom of the Heruli. Proponents of a distinct Western Herulian kingdom near the Rhine note that the letter was also sent to the kings of the Thuringians and Warini\u2014quite far to the north of the Danube, and more directly threatened by the Franks who are discussed in the letter; opponents emphasize that Theoderic was clearly concerned with a large part of central Europe, and that the Franks did in reality quickly make inroads towards the Middle Danubian region whence Italy could be threatened.\nKingdom on the Middle Danube.\nAs already mentioned, the \"Laterculus Veronensis\" shows that Heruli and Rugii were already present somewhere in western Europe in about 314. Similar listings from later in the 4th century, the \"Cosmographia\" of Julius Honorius, and probably also the \"Liber Generationis\", both listed the Heruli near the Marcomanni and Quadi who are known from many records to have lived until the 4th century in the region north of the Danube, where the Herule kingdom would later be found.\nIn the late 4th century, large groups of Eastern European peoples including most notably the Goths and Alans, crossed the Lower Danube into the Roman empire, while others entered the Middle Danubian region, between the Carpathians and the Roman empire. The Huns and their allies also moved east and began established themselves near the Danube around 400. The Roman military was weakened and increased reliant upon barbarian forces. They were also internally divided with a rebel emperor in Gaul, Constantine III, and open conflict between the Western and Eastern empires in the Balkans. Before 409, large numbers of \"ferocious\" peoples including the Heruli, Quadi, Vandals, Sarmatians, Alans, Gepids, Saxons, Burgundians, and Alemanni, together with provincial inhabitants of Roman Pannonia, are reported by Saint Jerome to have crossed the Rhine and occupied all parts of Roman Gaul. Several of these such as the Vandals, Alans, Saxons and Burgundians are known to have permanently settled in different parts of Roman Gaul and Iberia. Also at this time, the Gothic king Radagaisus invaded Italy itself from Pannonia, occupying Roman forces there. \nBy 450 AD, the Heruli and the other peoples still in the Middle Danube area, including Gepids, Rugi, Sciri, and many of the Goths, Alans and Sarmatians, were firmly within the Hunnic empire of Attila. Although they were not specifically listed by Sidonius or Jordanes, Heruli are believed to have been among the peoples who fought at the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains between the Romans and Attila, possibly on both sides. As indirect evidence, centuries later Pauls Diaconus listed the subject peoples who Attila could call upon in addition to the better known Goths and Gepids: \"Marcomanni, Suebi, Quadi, and alongside them the Herules, Thuringi and Rugii\".\nAfter the death of Attila in 453, his sons lost power over the various peoples of his empire at the Battle of Nedao in 454. The Heruli are listed by Jordanes as having fought at the Battle of Nedao, but we do not know if they took the Gepid or Ostrogothic side. They were subsequently among the several peoples now able to consolidate a kingdom on the Danube. Scholars believe it lay north of modern Vienna and Bratislava, near the Morava river, and possibly extended as far east as the Little Carpathians. They ruled over a mixed population including Suevi, Huns and Alans. Compared to other Middle Danubian kingdoms in this period, Peter Heather has described this Heruli kingdom as \"middle-sized\", similar to the Rugian one, but \"clearly not as militarily powerful, say, as the Gothic, Lombard, or Gepid confederations which generated much longer-lived political entities, and into which elements of the Rugii and Heruli were eventually absorbed\".\nFrom this region the life story of Severinus of Noricum reports that the Heruli attacked Ioviaco near Passau in 480. In 468/469 they benefited from the subsequent downfall of Odoacer's people the Sciri, and were able establish control on the previously Roman south side of the Danube, north of Lake Balaton in modern Hungary. These areas have belonged to the kingdoms of the Suevi and Sciri, who had been under pressure from the Ostrogoths.\nOdoacer, the commander of the Imperial \"foederati\" troops in Italy who deposed the last Western Roman Emperor Romulus Augustus in 476 AD, came to be seen as king over several of the Danubian peoples including the Heruli. Heruli soldiers were also strongly associated with his Italian kingdom. When Odoacer defeated their neighbours the Rugii in 488, the Heruli on the Danube once again benefitted, taking of the Rugian territories.\nHowever, the Heruli suffered badly in Italy, as loyalists of Odoacer, when he was defeated by the Ostrogoth Theoderic, who became the new king in Italy. By 500, the Herulian kingdom on the Danube, now under a king named Rodulph, had made peace with Theoderic and become his allies. Paul the Deacon also mentioned Heruli living in Italy under Ostrogothic rule. Peter Heather estimates that the Herulian kingdom could muster an army of 5,000-10,000 men.\nTheoderic's efforts to build a system of alliances in Western Europe were made difficult both by counter diplomacy, for example between Merovingian Franks and the Byzantine Empire, and also the arrival of a new Germanic people into the Danubian region, the Lombards who were initially under Herule hegemony. The Herulian king Rodulph lost his kingdom to the Lombards at some point between 494 and 508.\nLater history.\nAfter the Middle Danubian Herulian kingdom was destroyed by the Lombards in or before 508, Herulian fortunes waned. According to Procopius, in 512 a group including royalty went north and settled in Thule, which for Procopius meant Scandinavia. Procopius noted that these Heruli first traversed the lands of the Slavs, then empty lands, and then the lands of the Danes, until finally settling down nearby the Geats. Peter Heather considers this account to be \"entirely plausible\" although he notes that others have labelled it a \"fairy story\", and given that it only appears in one source it is possible to deny its validity.\nAnother Heruli group were assigned civil and military offices by Theoderic the Great in Pavia in north Italy.\nWhat happened to the main part of the Danubian Heruli has been difficult to reconstruct from Procopius, but according to Steinacher they first moved downstream on the Danube to an area where the Rugii had sought refuge in 488. Here they suffered famine. They sought refuge among the Gepids, but wanting to avoid being mistreated by them crossed the Danube came under East Roman authority.\nAnastasius Caesar allowed them to resettle depopulated \"lands and cities\" in the empire in 512. Modern scholars debate whether they were moved then to Singidunum (modern Belgrade), or first to Bassianae, and to Singidunum some decades later, by Justinian. This area had been re-acquired by the empire from the Goths, who now ruled Italy from Ravenna. Justinian integrated them into the empire as a buffer between the Romans and the more independent Lombards and Gepids to the north. Under his encouragement, the Herule king Grepes converted to Orthodox Christianity in 528 together with some nobles and twelve relatives. Procopius who felt that this made them somewhat gentler, also showed in his account of the wars against the African Vandals, that some of them were Arian Christians.\nThe Heruli were often mentioned during the times of Justinian, who used them in his extensive military campaigns in many countries including Italy, Syria, and North Africa. Pharas was a notable Herulian commander during this period. Several thousand Heruli served in the personal guard of Belisarius throughout the campaigns, and Narses also recruited from them. They were a participant in the Byzantine-Sasanian wars.\nGrepes and most of his family had apparently died by the early 540s, possibly in the Plague of Justinian (541-542). Procopius related that in the 540s the Heruli who had been settled in the Roman Balkans killed their own king Ochus and, not wanting the one assigned by the emperor, Suartuas, they made contact with the Heruli who had gone to Thule decades earlier, seeking a new king. Their first choice fell sick and died when they had come to the country of the Dani, and a second choice was made. The new king Datius arrived with his brother Aordus and 200 young men. The Heruli who were sent against Suartuas defected with him and were supported by the empire. The supporters of Datius, two thirds of the Heruli, submitted to the Gepids. This period of rebellion against Rome lasted approximately 545\u2013548, the period immediately before conflict between their larger neighbours the Gepids and Lombards broke out, but this rebellion was repressed by Justinian.\nIn 549, when the Gepids fought the Romans, and Heruli fought on both sides. In any case after one generation in the Belgrade area, the Herulian federate polity in the Balkans disappears from the surviving historical records, apparently replaced by the incoming Avars.\nPeter Heather has written that: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;by c.540 being a Herule had ceased to be the main determinant of individual behaviour; the Heruli had ceased to operate together on the basis of that shared heritage, and different Heruli were adopting different strategies for survival in the new political conditions which even caused them to fight on opposing sides. After c.540, we still find small groups called Heruli fighting for the East Romans in Italy, and it is noticeable that the Roman commanders were careful to appoint for them leaders of their own race. Thus some sense of identity probably remained. That said, we are clearly dealing with a few fragments of the original group, and, in the prevailing circumstances, Herule identity had no future.\nSarantis however shows that the Belgrade-region Heruli continued to be recruited, and to play a role in local conflicts involving the Gepids and Lombards, into the 550s. Suartas, a Herule general for the Romans, led Herule forces against the Gepids in 552 for example. However it appears that by this period the semi-independent Heruli near Belgrade became Roman provincials.\nIn 566, Sinduald, a Herule military leader under Narses, was declared a king of Heruli in Trentino in northern Italy, but he was executed by Narses. Sinduald was said to be a descendant of the Herules who had already entered Italy under Odoacer.\nPaul the Deacon writes that many Heruli joined the Lombard king Alboin in their eventual conquest of Italy from the empire in the late 6th century AD.\nAlong with the Rugii and Sciri, the Heruli may have contributed to the formation of the Bavarii.\nCulture.\nPolitical culture.\nWhile there is very little detailed information available, historical sources name six kings of the Danubian Herules, from the first half of the 6th century. Unlike their neighbours the Goths and Gepids, they appear to have had a limited role, and some of the military leaders who fought under the Romans are better known. Based mainly on the remarks of Procopius it appears they did not necessarily make all decisions, but they were expected to play a partly symbolic role in leading their people in battle, and representing them in dealings with other peoples and empires. Procopius suggests that the Herulian kings were often challenged and could be deposed if they failed to meet the expectations of their people.\nReligion.\nThe early religion of the Heruli is vividly described by Procopius in his \"\". He describes them as a polytheistic society known to practice human sacrifice. The Heruli appear to have been worshippers of Odin, and might have been responsible for the spread of such worship to Northern Europe.\nBy the time of Justinian, Procopius reports that many Heruli were Arian Christians. In any case, Justinian appears to have pursued a policy of converting them to orthodox Chalcedonian Christianity.\nSociety.\nProcopius writes that the Heruli practiced a form of senicide, having a non-relative kill the sick and elderly and burning the remains on a wooden pyre. Procopius also states that, following the death of their husbands, Herulian women were expected to commit suicide by hanging.\nFurthermore, Procopius claims that the Heruli practiced homosexuality or bestiality, depending on the interpretation:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;They are still, however, faithless toward them \"[the Romans]\", and since they are given to avarice, they are eager to do violence to their neighbours, feeling no shame at such conduct. And they mate in an unholy manner, especially men with asses, and they are the basest of all men and utterly abandoned rascals.\nThe translated \"especially men with asses\" is from the original Greek text (provided next to Dewing's translation) \"\u1f02\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b5 \u03ba\u03b1\u03af \u1f00\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u1ff6\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03af \u1f44\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\" where \"\u1f44\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\" is genitive plural of \"https://\", meaning \"donkeys\".\nIt appears that Procopius disliked the Heruli and wanted to present them in as negative light as possible. His description of bestiality among the Heruli is almost certainly untrue.\nWarfare.\nThe Heruli were famous for the quality of their infantry, who were recruited as mercenaries by all other peoples. They were known particularly for their speed, and were perhaps used for the stabbing cavalry. Procopius described the Heruli in the Battle of Anglon against Persians, carrying no protective armor save a shield and thick jacket. This form of warfare has been compared to that of the berserkers of the Viking Age.\nHerulian slaves are known to have accompanied the Herules into combat. Slaves were forbidden from donning a shield until having proven themselves brave on the battlefield. This practice might be a relic of ancient Indo-European tradition. Steinacher has pointed out that, while this remark has reasonably been seen as evidence of an \"initiation rite\", initiation rites are so common that caution is required:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is of course far from clear exactly what Procopius had in mind when writing about Herul 'slaves'. But he surely provided plenty of evidence that any gens was open to newcomers. As in any other human community, both in the past and in the present, such newcomers had to prove themselves worthy before receiving full membership in that community. This must have been even truer for a community geared towards warfare.\nMaterial culture.\nThe tumuli of the Heruli on the Middle Danube in the early 6th century are very similar to contemporary tumuli built in southern Sweden. At this time, the Heruli appears to have had close trade relations with peoples living near the Baltic Sea.\nPhysical appearance.\nIn \"Getica\", Jordanes writes that the Heruli claimed to be the tallest people of Scandza. Jordanes further writes that all the peoples of Scandza \"surpassed the Germans in size and spirit\". Sidonius Apollinaris wrote that the Heruli had blue-grey eyes.\nThe negative excursus of Procopius.\nScholars remark that the historian Procopius had a notable fascination with the Herules, which colors his descriptions of them. As Steinacher remarks, \"Procopius's Herul excursus [...] is full of stereotypes and negative attitudes towards this primitive people and its archaic conventions\". This means that caution is required when using his descriptions as evidence. In the words of Walter Goffart:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Though appreciative of their military qualities, he goes out of his way to blacken their character - \"they are the basest of all men and utterly abandoned rascals,\" \"no men in the world are less bound by convention or more unstable.\" His low opinion may result from the \"special relationship\" the Herules appear to have had with Justinian's eunuch general, Narses, who Procopius disliked.\nAlthough Procopius praised the Herule named Pharas who brought about the surrender of the north African Vandal king Gelimer, he noted that \"despite\" being born a Herule, he did not drink excessively and was not unreliable.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Procopius was not mollified. The Herules were part of the panorama of an entire \"West\" that, owing to Justinian's neglect, had come into the possession of the barbarians by the late 540s. [...] The crowning irony, in the historian's view, was that, because some Herules served as Roman \"foederati\", they both plundered Roman subjects and collected pay from the Roman emperor.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\nAncient sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nModern sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}
{"id": "37047", "revid": "24902", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37047", "title": "Akasha", "text": "Term for space or \u00e6ther\nAkasha (Sanskrit \"\" ) means aether in traditional Hindu cosmology. The term has also been adopted in Western occultism and spiritualism in the late 19th century CE. In many modern Indo-Aryan languages and Dravidian languages the corresponding word retains a generic meaning of \"aether\". The Hindu god of Akasha is Dyaus.\nEtymology and meaning.\nThe word in Sanskrit is derived from a root meaning \"to be\". It appears as a masculine noun in Vedic Sanskrit with a generic meaning of \"aether\". In Classical Sanskrit, the noun acquires the neuter gender and may express the concept of \"aether\" (Manusmriti, Shatapatha Brahmana). In Vedantic philosophy, the word acquires its technical meaning of \"an ethereal fluid imagined as pervading the cosmos\".\nIndian philosophy classify Akasha into three categories. The first category, represented by the \"Nyaya,\" \"Vaisheshika\", Purva Mimamsa, and Jain traditions, considers Akasha to be an independent, all-pervading, and eternal substance essential to the structure of the universe. The second category encompassing the Samkhya-Yoga and Vedanta, views Akasha as an evolute of something else. The third category regards Akasha as a mental concept, a view particularly reflected in later Buddhist systems.\nHinduism.\nIn Hinduism, \"akasha\" means the basis and essence of all things in the material world; the first element created. A Hindu mantra \"p\u1e5bthivy\u0101pastejov\u0101yur\u0101k\u0101\u015b\u0101ta\" indicates the sequence of initial appearance of the five basic gross elements. Thus, first appeared aether, from which appeared air, from that fire, from which water, and therefrom the earth. It is one of the \"Panchamahabhuta\", or \"five gross elements\"; its main characteristic is \"Shabda\" (sound). The direct translation of \"akasha\" is the word meaning 'aether' in Hinduism.\nThe \"Nyaya\" and \"Vaisheshika\" schools of Hindu philosophy state that \"akasha\" (aether) is the fifth physical substance, which is the substratum of the quality of sound. It is the one, eternal, and all-pervading physical substance, which is imperceptible.\nAccording to the \"Samkhya\" school, \"akasha\" is one of the five \"Mah\u0101bh\u016btas\" (grand physical elements) having the specific property of sound.\nIn the \"Shiva Purana\", it identifies \"akasha\" as having \"the only attribute of sound\".\nIn the \"Linga Purana\" (Volume I, Chapter 65), \"akasha\" is translated as \"aether\" and listed as one of the 1000 names of Shiva.\nJainism.\nAkasha is space in the Jain conception of the cosmos. Akasha is one of the six \"dravyas\" (substances) and it accommodates the other five, namely sentient beings or souls (\"j\u012bva\"), non-sentient substance or matter (\"pudgala\"), principle of motion (\"dharma\"), the principle of rest (\"adharma\"), and the principle of time (\"k\u0101la\").\nIt falls into the \"Ajiva\" category, divided into two parts: \"Loakasa\" (the part occupied by the material world) and \"Aloakasa\" (the space beyond it which is absolutely void and empty). In \"Loakasa\" the universe forms only a part. Akasha is that which gives space and makes room for the existence of all extended substances.\nAt the summit of the \"lok\u0101k\u0101\u015ba\" is the \"Siddhashila\" (abode of the liberated souls).\nBuddhism.\nIn Buddhist phenomenology, \"akasha\" is divided into limited space (\u0101k\u0101sa-dh\u0101tu) and endless space (ajat\u0101kas\u0101). The Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika, an early school of Buddhist philosophy, hold the existence of \"akasha\" to be real. \u0100k\u0101sa is identified as the first ar\u016bpa jh\u0101na, but usually translates as \"infinite space.\"\n\u0100k\u0101\u015ba (Sanskrit: \"space\") holds two primary meanings in Abhidharma analysis: \nIn meditation, \"\u0101k\u0101\u015ba\" is significant in the context of the sphere of infinite space (\"\u0101k\u0101\u015b\u0101nanty\u0101yatana\"), the first of the four immaterial absorptions (\"arupa\"-\"dhy\u0101nas\"). \nPhilosophically, \"\u0101k\u0101\u015ba\" is considered one of the uncompounded phenomena (\"asa\u1e43sk\u1e5btadharmas\") in six Buddhist schools, including the \"Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da\", \"Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika\", and later \"Yog\u0101c\u0101ra\". However, three schools, including the \"Therav\u0101da\", reject this interpretation. \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "37053", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37053", "title": "Maunder Minimum", "text": "Period of low solar activity, 1645\u20131715\nThe Maunder Minimum, also known as the \"prolonged sunspot minimum\", was a period around 1645 to 1715 during which sunspots became exceedingly rare. During the 28-year period 1672\u20131699 within the minimum, observations revealed fewer than 50 sunspots. This contrasts with the typical 40,000\u201350,000 sunspots seen in modern times over a similar timespan.\nThe Maunder Minimum was first noted by Gustav Sp\u00f6rer in publications in 1887 and 1889, work that was relayed to the Royal Astronomical Society in London, and then expanded on, by solar astronomers Edward Walter Maunder (1851\u20131928), and his wife Annie Russell Maunder (1868\u20131947), who also studied how sunspot latitudes changed with time. Two papers were published in Edward Maunder's name in 1890 and 1894, and he cited the two earlier papers written by Gustav Sp\u00f6rer. Because Annie Maunder had not received a university degree, restrictions at the time caused her contribution not to be publicly recognized. The term \"Maunder Minimum\" was popularised by John A. Eddy, who published a landmark paper in \"Science\" in 1976.\nThe Maunder Minimum occurred within the Little Ice Age, a long period (c.\u20091300\u00a0\u2013 c.\u20091850) of lower-than-average European temperatures. The reduced solar activity may have contributed to the climatic cooling, although the cooling began before the solar minimum and its primary cause is believed to be volcanic activity.\nSunspot observations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Unsolved/styles.css\" /&gt;\nUnsolved problem in astronomy\nWhat caused the Maunder Minimum and other grand minima, and how does the solar cycle recover from a minimum state?\nMore unsolved problems in astronomy\nThe Maunder Minimum occurred between 1645 and 1715 when very few sunspots were observed. That was not because of a lack of observations, as during the 17th century, Giovanni Domenico Cassini carried out a systematic program of solar observations at the Paris Observatory, thanks to the astronomers Jean Picard and Philippe de La Hire. Johannes Hevelius also performed observations on his own. Here is the total of sunspots recorded, by example, in the decennial years (omitting Wolf numbers):\nDuring the Maunder Minimum enough sunspots were sighted that 11-year cycles could be determined from the count. The maxima occurred in 1676\u20131677, 1684, 1695, 1705 and 1718. Sunspot activity was then concentrated in the southern hemisphere of the Sun, except for the last cycle when the sunspots appeared in the northern hemisphere. According to Sp\u00f6rer's law, spots appear at high latitudes at the start of a cycle, subsequently moving to lower latitudes until they average about latitude 15\u00b0 at solar maximum. The average then continues to drift lower to about 7\u00b0 and after that, while spots of the old cycle fade, new cycle spots start appearing again at high latitudes. The visibility of these spots is also affected by the velocity of the Sun's surface rotation at various latitudes:\nVisibility is somewhat affected by observations being done from the ecliptic. The ecliptic is inclined 7\u00b0 from the plane of the Sun's equator (latitude 0\u00b0).\nEclipses during the Maunder Minimum.\nIn his highly influential paper, John A. Eddy discussed solar eclipses during the Maunder Minimum. From text of eye-witness reports of events in 1652, 1706 and 1715, he concluded that the solar corona was weak in intensity and unstructured during the Maunder Minimum. However, no graphical evidence of these events was available to him. A few representations of these events were available in political cartoons and on coins and medals but these were, almost certainly, not drawn by observers who had actually witnessed the events. There were two prints made by witnesses of the 1706 event but these were made for commercial reasons and not by trained astronomers. Then in 2012 Markus Heinz of the Berlin State Library discovered two paintings of the 1706 eclipse that were known to have existed but were thought lost. They were painted by a trained and skilful astronomer and observer, Maria Clara Eimmart, the daughter of the director of an observatory housed on a bastion of the walls of Nuremberg Castle. The paintings were in excellent agreement with detailed text description of the event by Johann Philipp Wurzelbau (also in Nuremberg) and by French mathematician and cartographer Jean de Clapi\u00e8s and astronomer Fran\u00e7ois de Plantade who observed the same event from the Babote Tower in Montpellier. This confirmed Eddy's conclusion about a weak and structureless corona during the Maunder minimum and agreed with simulations of the structureless F-corona, with no detected K-corona that is ordered by the magnetic field, as has been modelled for low coronal magnetic flux. A full discussion of these observations of the Maunder minimum corona and how the K-corona had partially returned by the time of the 1715 event is given by Hayakawa et al. (2020).\nLittle Ice Age.\nThe Maunder Minimum roughly coincided with the middle part of the Little Ice Age, during which Europe and North America experienced colder than average temperatures. Whether there is a causal relationship, however, is still under evaluation. The current best hypothesis for the cause of the Little Ice Age is that it was the result of volcanic action. The onset of the Little Ice Age also occurred well before the beginning of the Maunder Minimum, and northern-hemisphere temperatures during the Maunder Minimum were not significantly different from the previous 80 years, suggesting a decline in solar activity was not the main causal driver of the Little Ice Age.\nThe correlation between low sunspot activity and cold winters in England has been analyzed using the longest existing surface temperature record, the Central England Temperature record. A potential explanation of this has been offered by observations by NASA's Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment, which suggest that solar ultraviolet light output is more variable over the course of the solar cycle than scientists had previously thought. A 2011 study found that low solar activity was linked to jet stream behavior, resulting in mild winters in some places (southern Europe and Canada/Greenland) and colder winters in others (northern Europe and the United States). In Europe, examples of very cold winters are 1683\u201384, 1694\u201395, and the winter of 1708\u201309.\nOther observations.\nPast solar activity may be recorded by various proxies, including carbon-14 and beryllium-10. These indicate lower solar activity during the Maunder Minimum. The scale of changes resulting in the production of carbon-14 in one cycle is small (about one percent of medium abundance) and can be taken into account when radiocarbon dating is used to determine the age of archaeological artifacts. The interpretation of the beryllium-10 and carbon-14 cosmogenic isotope abundance records stored in terrestrial reservoirs such as ice sheets and tree rings has been greatly aided by reconstructions of solar and heliospheric magnetic fields based on historic data on geomagnetic storm activity, which bridge the time gap between the end of the usable cosmogenic isotope data and the start of modern spacecraft data.\nOther historical sunspot minima have been detected either directly or by the analysis of the cosmogenic isotopes; these include the Sp\u00f6rer Minimum (1450\u20131540), and less markedly the Dalton Minimum (1790\u20131820). In a 2012 study, sunspot minima have been detected by analysis of carbon-14 in lake sediments. In total, there seem to have been 18 periods of sunspot minima in the last 8,000 years, and studies indicate that the Sun currently spends up to a quarter of its time in these minima.\nA paper based on an analysis of a drawing by John Flamsteed suggests that the Sun's surface rotation slowed in the deep Maunder Minimum (1684).\nDuring the Maunder Minimum aurorae had been observed seemingly normally, with a regular decadal-scale cycle. This is somewhat surprising because the later, and less deep, Dalton sunspot minimum is clearly seen in auroral occurrence frequency, at least at lower geomagnetic latitudes. Because geomagnetic latitude is an important factor in auroral occurrence, (lower-latitude aurorae requiring higher levels of solar-terrestrial activity) it becomes important to allow for population migration and other factors that may have influenced the number of reliable auroral observers at a given magnetic latitude for the earlier dates. Decadal-scale cycles during the Maunder Minimum can also be seen in the abundances of the beryllium-10 cosmogenic isotope (which unlike carbon-14 can be studied with annual resolution) but these appear to be in antiphase with any remnant sunspot activity. An explanation in terms of solar cycles in loss of solar magnetic flux was proposed in 2012.\nThe fundamental papers on the Maunder Minimum have been published in \"Case studies on the Sp\u00f6rer, Maunder and Dalton Minima\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Sexual liberation included increased acceptance of sexual intercourse outside of traditional heterosexual, monogamous relationships, primarily marriage. The legalization of \"the pill\" as well as other forms of contraception, public nudity, pornography, premarital sex, homosexuality, masturbation, alternative forms of sexuality, and abortion all followed.\nThe term \"first sexual revolution\" is used by scholars to describe different periods of significant change in Western sexual norms, including the Christianization of Roman sexuality, the decline of Victorian morals, and the cultural shifts of the Roaring Twenties. Sexual revolution most commonly refers to the mid-20th century, when advances in contraception, medicine, and social movements led to widespread changes in attitudes and behaviors around sex. The sexual revolution was influenced by Freud's theory of unconscious drives and psychosexual development, Mead's ethnographic work on adolescent sexuality in Samoa, Unwin\u2019s cross-cultural studies, and the research of Kinsey and later Masters and Johnson, all of which challenged traditional beliefs about human sexuality.\nThe widespread availability of contraception from the early 20th century onward empowered individuals with reproductive choice, spurred legal and cultural shifts such as \"Griswold v. Connecticut\", and influenced later landmark rulings on privacy, abortion, and LGBTQ+ rights. \"Free love\" is a related social movement advocating for the separation of the state from sexual matters like marriage and birth control, emphasizing personal freedom in relationships, though it faced decline in the 1980s due to the AIDS crisis.\nBy the 1970s, premarital and non-marital sex had become increasingly accepted in the United States due to the rise of birth control, later marriages, declining stigma around divorce, and the normalization of casual and non-monogamous sexual relationships.\nOrigins.\nFirst sexual revolution.\nSeveral other periods in Western culture have been called the \"first sexual revolution\", to which the 1960s revolution would be the second (or later). The term \"sexual revolution\" itself has been used since at least the late 1920s. The term appeared as early as 1929; the book \"Is Sex Necessary? Or, Why You Feel the Way You Do\" by James Thurber and E. B. White, has a chapter titled \"The Sexual Revolution: Being a Rather Complete Survey of the Entire Sexual Scene\". According to Konstantin Dushenko, the term was in use in Soviet Russia in 1925.\nWhen speaking of the sexual revolution, historians make a distinction between the first and the second sexual revolution. In the first sexual revolution (1870\u20131910), Victorian morality lost its universal appeal. However, it did not lead to the rise of a \"permissive society\". Exemplary for this period is the rise and differentiation in forms of regulating sexuality.\nClassics professor Kyle Harper uses the phrase \"first sexual revolution\" to refer to the displacement of the norms of sexuality in Ancient Rome with those of Christianity as it was adopted throughout the Roman Empire. Romans accepted and legalized prostitution, bisexuality, and pederasty. Male promiscuity was considered normal and healthy as long as masculinity was maintained, associated with being the penetrating partner. In contrast, female chastity was required for respectable women, to ensure the integrity of family bloodlines. These attitudes were replaced by Christian prohibitions on homosexual acts and any sex outside marriage, including with slaves and prostitutes.\nHistory professor Faramerz Dabhoiwala cites the Age of Enlightenment\u2014approximately the 18th century\u2014as a major period of transition in the United Kingdom. During this time, the philosophy of liberalism developed and was popularized, and migration to cities increased opportunities for sex and made enforcement of rules more difficult than in small villages. Sexual misconduct in the Catholic Church undermined the credibility of religious authorities, and the rise of urban police forces helped distinguish crime from sin. Overall, toleration increased for heterosexual sex outside marriage, including prostitution, mistresses, and pre-marital sex. Though these acts were still condemned by many as libertine, infidelity became more often a civil matter than a criminal offense receiving capital punishment. Masturbation, homosexuality, and rape were generally less tolerated. Women went from being considered as lustful as men to passive partners, whose purity was important to reputation.\nCommentators such as history professor Kevin F. White have used the phrase \"first sexual revolution\" to refer to the Roaring Twenties. Victorian Era attitudes were somewhat destabilized by World War I and alcohol prohibition in the United States. At the same time the women's suffrage movement obtained voting rights, the subculture of the flapper girl included pre-marital sex and \"petting parties\".\nFormation.\nIndicators of non-traditional sexual behavior (e.g., gonorrhea incidence, births out of wedlock, and births to adolescents) began to rise dramatically in the mid-to-late 1950s. It brought about profound shifts in attitudes toward women's sexuality, homosexuality, pre-marital sexuality, and the freedom of sexual expression.\nPsychologists and scientists such as Wilhelm Reich and Alfred Kinsey influenced the changes. As well, changing mores were both stimulated by and reflected in literature and films, and by the social movements of the period, including the counterculture, the women's movement, and the gay rights movement. The counterculture contributed to the awareness of radical cultural change that was the social matrix of the sexual revolution.\nThe sexual revolution was initiated by those who shared a belief in the detrimental impact of sexual repression, a view that had previously been argued by Wilhelm Reich, D. H. Lawrence, Sigmund Freud, and the Surrealist movement.\nThe counterculture wanted to explore the body and mind, and free the personal self from the moral and legal sexual confines of traditional American values. The sexual revolution sprung from a conviction that the erotic should be celebrated as a normal part of life, dodging religion, family, industrialized moral codes, and the state.\nThe development of the birth control pill in 1960 gave women access to easy and more reliable contraception. Another likely cause was a vast improvement in obstetrics, greatly reducing the number of women who died due to childbearing, thus increasing the life expectancy of women. A third, more indirect cause was the large number of children born in the 1940s and throughout the 1950s all over the Western world, as the \"Baby Boom Generation\", many of whom would grow up in relatively prosperous and safe conditions, within a middle class on the rise and with better access to education and entertainment than ever before. By their demographic weight and their social and educational background, they came to trigger a shift in society towards more permissive and informalized attitudes.\nThe discovery of penicillin led to significant reductions in syphilis mortality, which, in turn, spurred an increase in non-traditional sex during the mid-to-late 1950s.\nThere was an increase in sexual encounters between unmarried adults. Divorce rates were dramatically increasing and marriage rates were significantly decreasing in this time period. The number of unmarried Americans aged twenty to twenty-four more than doubled from 4.3\u00a0million in 1960 to 9.7\u00a0million in 1976. Men and women sought to reshape marriage by experimenting with new practices consisting of open marriage, mate swapping, swinging, and communal sex. \nAcademic influences.\nFreudian school.\nSigmund Freud of Vienna believed human behavior was motivated by unconscious drives, primarily by the libido or \"Sexual Energy\". Freud proposed to study how these unconscious drives were repressed and found expression through other cultural outlets. He called this therapy \"psychoanalysis\".\nWhile Freud's ideas were sometimes ignored or provoked resistance within Viennese society, his ideas soon entered the discussions and working methods of anthropologists, artists and writers all over Europe, and from the 1920s in the United States. His conception of a primary sexual drive that would not be ultimately curbed by law, education or standards of decorum spelled a serious challenge to Victorian prudishness, and his theory of psychosexual development proposed a model for the development of sexual orientations and desires; children emerged from the Oedipus complex, a sexual desire towards their parent of the opposite sex. The idea of children having their parents as their early sexual targets was particularly shocking to Victorian and early 20th century society.\nAccording to Freud's theory, in the earliest stage of a child's psychosexual development, the oral stage, the mother's breast became the formative source of all later erotic sensation. Much of his research remains widely contested by professionals in the field, though it has spurred critical developments in the humanities.\nTwo anarchist and Marxist proponents of Freud, Otto Gross and Wilhelm Reich (who famously coined the phrase \"sexual revolution\"), developed a sociology of sex in the 1910s through the 1930s in which the animal-like competitive reproductive behavior was seen as a legacy of ancestral human evolution reflecting in every social relation, as per the Freudian interpretation. Hence, the liberation of sexual behavior was considered by them to be a means to social revolution.\nMead's \"Coming of Age in Samoa\".\nThe 1928 publication of anthropologist Margaret Mead's \"Coming of Age in Samoa\" brought the sexual revolution to the public scene, as her thoughts concerning sexual freedom pervaded academia. Mead's ethnography focused on the psychosexual development of adolescents in Samoa. She recorded that their adolescence was not, in fact, a time of \"storm and stress\" as Erikson's stages of development suggest, but that the sexual freedom experienced by the adolescents actually permitted them an easy transition from childhood to adulthood.\nMead's findings were later criticized by anthropologist Derek Freeman, who investigated her claims of promiscuity and conducted his own ethnography of Samoan society.\nKinsey and Masters and Johnson.\nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s, Alfred\u00a0C.\u00a0Kinsey published two surveys of modern sexual behavior. In 1948 Kinsey published the book \"Sexual Behavior in the Human Male\". He followed this five years later with \"Sexual Behavior in the Human Female\". These books began a revolution in social awareness of, and public attention given to, human sexuality.\nKinsey based his findings in both these books on interviews that he and his team of researchers conducted with thousands of Americans, beginning in the 1930s. The interviews were extensive and could last for several hours; they were supplemented by diaries and other documents that the interviewees were willing to have copied, and sometimes films of them engaging in masturbation or sexual intercourse, if they volunteered and it was practical. Kinsey found in the course of these interviews that many sexual behaviors which had previously been seen as marginal or \"abnormal\" were in fact more common than previously recognized and were part of the normal spectrum of human sexual behavior; for instance, he is the source of the widely quoted statistic that 4% of the male population is primarily homosexual. He advocated using this information to reform sex-related laws, which at the time were often draconian (for example two men having consensual sex in private was considered a crime).\nKinsey's books became bestsellers when published, and laid the groundwork for researchers William H. Masters and Virginia E. Johnson to study the nature and scope of sexual practices among young Americans. Their books, \"Human Sexual Response\" and \"Human Sexual Inadequacy\", published in 1966 and 1970 respectively, were also best-sellers, and are now considered classic texts in the field.\nPopular culture.\nErotic novels.\nIn the United States in the years 1959 through 1966, bans on three books with explicit erotic content were challenged and overturned. This also occurred in the United Kingdom starting with the 1959 Obscene Publications Act and reaching a peak with the \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\"\u00a0court case.\nPrior to this time, a patchwork of regulations (as well as local customs and vigilante actions) governed what could and could not be published. For example, the United States Customs Service banned James Joyce's \"Ulysses\" by refusing to allow it to be imported into the United States. The Roman Catholic Church's \"Index Librorum Prohibitorum\" carried great weight among Catholics, and any book appearing on it was tantamount to an effective and instant boycott. Boston's Watch and Ward Society, a largely Protestant creation inspired by Anthony Comstock, made \"banned in Boston\" a national by-word.\nIn 1959 Grove Press published an unexpurgated version of the 1928 novel \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\" by D.\u00a0H.\u00a0Lawrence. The U.S. Post Office confiscated copies sent through the mail. Lawyer Charles Rembar sued the New York City Postmaster, and won in New York and then on federal appeal.\nHenry Miller's 1934 novel, \"Tropic of Cancer\", had explicit sexual passages and could not be published in the United States; an edition was printed by the Obelisk Press in Paris and copies were smuggled into the United States. In 1961 Grove Press issued a copy of the work, and dozens of booksellers were sued for selling it. The issue was ultimately settled by the U.S.\u00a0 Supreme Court's 1964 decision in \"Grove Press, Inc. v. Gerstein\".\nIn 1963 Putnam published John Cleland's 1750\u00a0novel \"Fanny Hill\". Charles Rembar appealed a restraining order against it all the way to the U.S.\u00a0 Supreme Court and won. In \"Memoirs v. Massachusetts\", 383\u00a0 U.S.\u00a0413, the court ruled that sex was \"a great and mysterious motive force in human life\", and that its expression in literature was protected by the First Amendment.\nBy permitting the publication of \"Fanny Hill\", the U.S.\u00a0 Supreme Court set the bar for any ban so high that Rembar himself called the 1966\u00a0 decision \"the end of obscenity\". Only books primarily appealing to \"prurient interest\" could be banned. In a famous phrase, the court said that obscenity is \"utterly without redeeming social importance\"\u2014meaning that a work with any redeeming social importance or literary merit was arguably not obscene, even if it contained isolated passages that could \"deprave and corrupt\" some readers.\nExplicit sex on screen and stage.\nSwedish filmmakers like Ingmar Bergman and Vilgot Sj\u00f6man contributed to sexual liberation with sexually themed films that challenged conservative international standards. The 1951 film \"Hon dansade en sommar\" (\"She Danced One Summer AKA One Summer of Happiness\") displayed explicit nudity, including bathing in a lake.\nThis film, as well as Bergman's \"Sommaren med Monika\" (\"The Summer with Monika\", 1951) and \"Tystnaden (The Silence\", 1963), caused an international uproar, not least in the United States, where the films were charged with violating standards of decency. Vilgot Sj\u00f6man's film \"I Am Curious (Yellow)\", also was very popular in the United States. Another of his films, \"491\", highlighted homosexuality. \"K\u00e4rlekens spr\u00e5k\" (\"The Language of Love\") was an informative documentary about sex and sexual techniques that featured the first real act of sex in a mainstream film.\nFrom these films, the myth of \"Swedish sin\" (licentiousness and seductive nudity) arose. The image of \"hot love and cold people\" emerged, with sexual liberalism seen as part of the modernization process that, by breaking down traditional borders, would lead to the emancipation of natural forces and desires. In Sweden and nearby countries at the time, these films, by virtue of being made by directors who had established themselves as leading names in their generation, helped delegitimize the idea of habitually demanding that films should avoid overtly sexual subject matter. The films eventually progressed the public's attitude toward sex, especially in Sweden and other northern European countries, which today tend to be more sexually liberal than others.\nFashion.\nThe monokini, also known as a \"topless bikini\" or \"unikini\", was designed by Rudi Gernreich in 1964, consisting of only a brief, close-fitting bottom and two thin straps; it was the first women's topless swimsuit. Gernreich's revolutionary and controversial design included a bottom that \"extended from the midriff to the upper thigh\" and was \"held up by shoestring laces that make a halter around the neck.\" Some credit Gernreich's design with initiating, or describe it as a symbol of, the 1960s sexual revolution.\nNonfiction.\nThe court decisions that legalized the publication of \"Fanny Hill\" had an even more important effect: freed from fears of legal action, nonfiction works about sex and sexuality started to appear more often. These books were factual and in fact, educational, made available in mainstream bookstores and mail-order book clubs to a mainstream readership, and their authors were guests on late-night talk shows. Earlier books such as \"What Every Girl Should Know\" (Margaret Sanger, 1920) and \"A Marriage Manual\" (Hannah and Abraham Stone, 1939) had broken the silence and, by the 1950s, in the United States, it had become rare for women to go into their wedding nights not knowing what to expect.\nThe open discussion of sex as pleasure, and descriptions of sexual practices and techniques, was revolutionary. There were practices that some had heard of, but many adults did not know if they were realities or fantasies found only in pornographic books. The Kinsey report revealed that these practices were, at the very least, surprisingly frequent. These other books asserted, in the words of a 1980 book by Irene Kassorla, that \"Nice Girls Do \u2013 And Now You Can Too\".\nIn 1962, Helen Gurley Brown published \"Sex and the Single Girl: The Unmarried Woman's Guide to Men, Careers, the Apartment, Diet, Fashion, Money and Men.\"\nIn 1969 Joan Garrity, identifying herself only as \"J.\", published \"The Way to Become the Sensuous Woman\", with information on exercises to improve the dexterity of one's tongue and how to have anal sex.\nThe same year saw the appearance of David Reuben's book \"Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)\". Despite the dignity of Reuben's medical credentials, this book was light-hearted in tone.\nIn 1970 the Boston Women's Health Collective published \"Women and Their Bodies\", reissued a year later as \"Our Bodies, Ourselves\"). Though not an erotic treatise or sex manual, the book included frank descriptions of sexuality, and contained illustrations that could have caused legal problems just a few years earlier.\nAlex Comfort's \"The Joy of Sex: A Gourmet Guide to Love Making\" appeared in 1972. In later editions, Comfort's exuberance was tamed in response to AIDS.\nIn 1975 Will McBride's \"Zeig Mal!\" (Show Me!), written with psychologist Helga Fleichhauer-Hardt for children and their parents, appeared in bookstores on both sides of the Atlantic. Appreciated by many parents for its frank depiction of pre-adolescent sexual discovery and exploration, it scandalized others and was pulled from circulation in the United States and some other countries. The book was followed in 1989 by \"Zeig Mal Mehr!\" (\"Show Me More!\").\nNew emergence of pornography.\nThe somewhat more open and commercial circulation of pornography was a new phenomenon. Pornography operated as a form of \"cultural critique\" insofar as it transgresses societal conventions. Manuel Castells claims that the online communities, which emerged (from the 1980s) around early bulletin-board systems, originated from the ranks of those who had been part of the counterculture movements and alternative way of life emerging out of the sexual revolution.\nLynn Hunt points out that early modern \"pornography\" (18th century) is marked by a \"preponderance of female narrators\", that the women were portrayed as independent, determined, financially successful (though not always socially successful and recognized) and scornful of the new ideals of female virtue and domesticity, and not objectification of women's bodies as many view pornography today. The sexual revolution was not unprecedented in identifying sex as a site of political potential and social culture. It was suggested that the interchangeability of bodies within pornography had radical implications for the meaning of gender differences, roles and norms.\nIn 1971 \"Playboy\" stopped airbrushing pubic hair out of its centerfold picture spreads; this new addition caused the magazine to hit its all-time peak circulation of more than seven million copies in 1972 and men started having more choices when it came to magazines.\nIn 1972 \"Deep Throat\" became a popular movie for heterosexual couples. The movie played all over America and was the first pornographic movie to earn a gross of a million dollars.\nPornography was less stigmatized by the end of the 1980s, and more mainstream movies depicted sexual intercourse as entertainment. Magazines depicting nudity, such as the popular \"Playboy\" and \"Penthouse\" magazines, won some acceptance as mainstream journals, in which public figures became more comfortable openly expressing their fantasies.\nSome figures in the feminist movement, such as Andrea Dworkin, challenged the depiction of women as objects in these pornographic or \"urban men's\" magazines. Other feminists such as Betty Dodson went on to found the pro-sex feminist movement in response to anti-pornography campaigns.\nIn India, an organization named Indians For Sexual Liberties is advocating the legalization of the porn business in India. The organization's founder, Laxman Singh, questioned the reasoning behind deeming as illegal the depiction of legal acts.\nThe \"Playboy\" culture.\nIn 1953, Chicago resident Hugh Hefner founded \"Playboy\", a magazine which aimed to target males between the ages of 21 and 45. The coverpage and nude centerfold in the first edition featured Marilyn Monroe, then a rising sex symbol. Featuring cartoons, interviews, short fiction, Hefner's \"Playboy Philosophy\" and unclothed female \"Playmates\" posing provocatively, the magazine became immensely successful.\nIn 1960, Hefner expanded Playboy Enterprises, opening the first Playboy Club in Chicago, which grew to a chain of nightclubs and resorts. The private clubs offered relaxation for members, who were waited on by Playboy Bunnies.\nWhile Hefner claimed his company contributed to America's more liberal attitude towards sex, others believe he simply exploited it.\nPornographic film.\nIn 1969, \"Blue Movie\", directed by Andy Warhol, was the first adult erotic film depicting explicit sex to receive wide theatrical release in the United States. The film helped inaugurate the \"porno chic\" phenomenon in modern American culture. According to Warhol, \"Blue Movie\" was a major influence in the making of \"Last Tango in Paris\", starring Marlon Brando, and released a few years after \"Blue Movie\" was made.\nIn 1970, \"Mona the Virgin Nymph\" became the second film to gain wide release. The third, \"Deep Throat\", despite being rudimentary by the standards of mainstream filmmaking, achieved major box office success, following mentions by Johnny Carson on \"The Tonight Show\", and Bob Hope on television as well. In 1973, the far-more-accomplished (though still low-budget) \"The Devil in Miss Jones\" was the seventh-most-successful film of the year, and was well received by major media, including a favorable review by film critic Roger Ebert.\nIn 1976, \"The Opening of Misty Beethoven\" (based on the play \"Pygmalion\" by George Bernard Shaw) was released theatrically and is considered by Toni Bentley the \"crown jewel\" of \"the golden age of porn.\"\nBy the mid-1970s and through the 1980s, newly won sexual freedoms were being exploited by big businesses looking to capitalize on an increasingly permissive society, with the advent of public and hardcore pornography. \nModern revolutions.\nThe Industrial Revolution during the nineteenth century and the growth of science and technology, medicine and health care, resulted in better contraceptives being manufactured. Advances in the manufacture and production of rubber made possible the design and production of condoms that could be used by hundreds of millions of men and women to prevent pregnancy at little cost. Advances in chemistry, pharmacology, and biology, and human physiology led to the discovery and perfection of the first oral contraceptives, popularly known as \"the pill\".\nAll these developments took place alongside and combined with an increase in worldwide literacy rates and a decline in religious observance. Old values such as the Biblical notion of \"be fruitful and multiply\" were cast aside as people continued to feel alienated from the past and adopted the lifestyles of progressive modernizing cultures.\nAnother contribution that helped bring about this modern revolution of sexual freedom were the writings of Herbert Marcuse and Wilhelm Reich, who took the philosophy of Karl Marx and similar philosophers.\n\"No-fault\" unilateral divorce became legal and easier to obtain in many countries during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.\nThe women's movement redefined sexuality, not in terms of simply pleasing men but recognizing women's sexual satisfaction and sexual desire. \"The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm\" (1970) by Anne Koedt illustrates an understanding of a women's sexual anatomy including evidence for the clitoral orgasm, arguing against Freud's \"assumptions of women as inferior appendage to man, and her consequent social and psychological role.\" The women's movement was able to develop lesbian feminism, freedom from heterosexual act, and freedom from reproduction. Feminist Betty Friedan published the \"Feminine Mystique\" in 1963, concerning the many frustrations women had with their lives and with separate spheres which established a pattern of inequality.\nThe Gay Rights Movement started when the Stonewall riots of 1969 crystallized a broad grass-roots mobilization. New gay liberationist gave political meaning to \"coming out\" by extending the psychological-personal process into public life. During the 1950s the most feared thing of the homosexual culture was \"coming out\", the homosexual culture of the 1950s did everything they could to help keep their sexuality a secret from the public and everyone else in their lives, but Alfred Kinsey's research on homosexuality alleged that 39% of the unmarried male population had had at least one homosexual experience to orgasm between adolescence and old age.\nFeminism and sexual liberation.\nSince the beginning of the sexual liberation movement in the Western world, which coincided with second-wave feminism and the women's liberation movement initiated in the early 1960s, new religious movements and alternative spiritualities such as Modern Paganism and the New Age began to grow and spread across the globe alongside their intersection with the sexual liberation movement and the counterculture of the 1960s, and exhibited characteristic features, such as the embrace of alternative lifestyles, unconventional dress, rejection of Abrahamic religions and their conservative social mores, use of cannabis and other recreational drugs, relaxed attitude, sarcastic humble or self-imposed poverty, and \"laissez-faire\" sexual behavior. The sexual liberation movement was aided by feminist ideologues in their mutual struggle to challenge traditional ideas regarding female sexuality, male sexuality, and queer sexuality. Elimination of undue favorable bias towards men and objectification of women, as well as support for women's right to choose their sexual partners free of outside interference or societal judgment, were three of the main goals associated with sexual liberation from the feminist perspective. Since during the early stages of feminism, women's liberation was often equated with sexual liberation rather than associated with it. Many feminist thinkers believed that assertion of the primacy of sexuality would be a major step towards the ultimate goal of women's liberation, thus women were urged to initiate sexual advances, enjoy sex and experiment with new forms of sexuality.\nThe feminist movements insisted and focused on the sexual liberation for women, both physical and psychological. The pursuit of sexual pleasure for women was the core ideology, which subsequently was to set the foundation for female independence. Although whether or not sexual freedom should be a feminist issue is currently a much-debated topic, the feminist movement overtly defines itself as the movement for social, political, and economic equality of men and women. Feminist movements are also involved the fight against sexism and since sexism is a highly complex notion, it is difficult to separate the feminist critique toward sexism from its fight against sexual oppression.\nThe feminist movement has helped create a social climate in which LGBT people and women are increasingly able to be open and free with their sexuality, which enabled a spiritual liberation of sorts with regards to sex. Rather than being forced to hide their sexual desires or feelings, women and LGBT people have gained and continue to gain increased freedom in this area. Consequently, the feminist movement to end sexual oppression has and continues to directly contribute to the sexual liberation movement.\nContraception.\nAs birth control became widely accessible, men and women began to have more choice in the matter of having children than ever before. The 1916 invention of thin, disposable latex condoms for men led to widespread affordable condoms by the 1930s; the demise of the Comstock laws in 1936 set the stage for the promotion of available effective contraceptives such as the diaphragm and cervical cap; the 1960s introduction of the IUD and oral contraceptives for women gave a sense of freedom from barrier contraception. The Catholic Church under Pope Paul VI (1968) published \"Humanae vitae\" (Of Human Life), which was a declaration that banned the use of artificial contraception. Churches allowed for the rhythm method, which was a method of regulating fertility that pushed men and women to take advantage of the \"natural cycles\" of female fertility, during which women were \"naturally infertile.\" The opposition of Churches (e.g.\u00a0\"Humanae vitae\") led people who felt alienated from or not represented by religion to form parallel movements of secularization and exile from religion. Women gained much greater access to birth control in the \"Griswold\" \"girls world\" decision in 1965.\nThe 1965 Supreme Court case \"Griswold v. Connecticut\" ruled that the prohibition of contraception was unconstitutional on the grounds that it violated peoples' rights to marital privacy. In addition, in the 1960s and 1970s, the birth control movement advocated for the legalization of abortion and large scale education campaigns about contraception by governments. The \"Griswold v. Connecticut\" case and subsequent birth control movements created a precedent for later cases granting rights to birth control for unmarried couples \"(Eisenstadt v. Baird), 1972)\", rights to abortion for any woman (\"Roe v. Wade\", 1973), and the right to contraception for juveniles (Carey v. Population Services International, 1977). The Griswold case was also influential in and cited as precedent for landmark cases dealing with the right to homosexual relations (\"Lawrence v. Texas,\" 2003) and the right to same-sex marriage (\"Obergefell v. Hodges,\" 2015).\nFree love.\nFree love is a social movement that accepts all forms of love. The movement's initial goal was to separate the state from sexual matters such as marriage, birth control, and adultery. It stated that such issues were the concern of the people involved, and no one else.\nFree love continued in different forms throughout the 1970s and into the early 1980s, but its more assertive manifestations faced increased pushback in the mid-1980s, when the public first became aware of AIDS, a deadly sexually transmitted disease.\nNon-marital sex.\nPremarital sex, heavily stigmatized for some time, became more widely accepted. The increased availability of birth control (and the legalization of abortion in some places) helped reduce the chance that pre-marital sex would result in unwanted children. By the mid-1970s the majority of newly married American couples had experienced sex before marriage.\nCentral to the change was the development of relationships between unmarried adults, which resulted in earlier sexual experimentation reinforced by a later age of marriage. On average, Americans were gaining sexual experience before entering into monogamous relationships. The increasing divorce rate and the decreasing stigma attached to divorce during this era also contributed to sexual experimentation. By 1971, more than 75% of Americans thought that premarital sex was acceptable, a threefold increase from the 1950s, and the number of unmarried Americans aged twenty to twenty-four more than doubled from 1960 to 1976. Americans were becoming less and less interested in getting married and settling down and as well less interested in monogamous relationships. In 1971, 35% of the country said they thought marriage was obsolete.\nThe idea of marriage being outdated came from the development of casual sex between Americans. With the development of the birth control pill and the legalization of abortion in 1973, there was little threat of unwanted children out of wedlock. Also, during this time every known sexually transmitted disease was readily treatable.\nSwinger clubs were organizing in places ranging from the informal suburban home to disco-sized emporiums that offered a range of sexual possibilities with multiple partners. In New York City in 1977, Larry Levenson opened Plato's Retreat, which eventually shut down in 1985 under regular close scrutiny by public health authorities.\nLegacy.\nFraenkel (1992) believes that the \"sexual revolution\", which the West supposedly experienced in the late 1960s, is a misconception/misnomer, and that sex is never actually enjoyed freely as such, being rather \"observed\" in all fields of culture: a stance adopted toward human behavior referable to the concept of \"repressive desublimation\". According to this concept or interpretation (first evolved by Marxist philosopher Herbert Marcuse), the 'sexual revolution' would be an instance of a conservative force masquerading under the guise of liberation \u2013 a force sapping energies (here sexual) which would otherwise be available for a true social critique of a given behavior \u2013 and thus an impediment to any real political change which might emancipate the individual from \"totalitarian democracy\". (See also Bread and circuses, False consciousness and Frankfurt School.) Put baldly, the pursuit of \"sexual freedom\" may be construed as a distraction from the pursuit of \"actual\" freedom.\nAllyn argues that the sexual optimism of the 1960s waned with the economic crises of the 1970s, the massive commercialization of sex, increasing reports of child exploitation, disillusionment with the counter-culture and the New Left, and a combined left-right backlash against sexual liberation as an ideal. The discovery of herpes escalated anxieties rapidly and set the stage for the nation's panicked response to AIDS.\nAmong radical feminists, the view soon became widely held that, thus far, the sexual freedoms gained in the sexual revolution of the 1960s, such as the decreasing emphasis on monogamy, had been largely gained by men at women's expense. In \"Anticlimax: A Feminist Perspective on the Sexual Revolution\", Sheila Jeffreys asserted that the sexual revolution on men's terms contributed less to women's freedom than to their continued oppression, an assertion that has both commanded respect and attracted intense criticism. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, feminist sex wars broke out due to disagreements on pornography, on prostitution, and on BDSM, as well as sexuality in general.\nAlthough the rate of teenage sexual activity is hard to record, the prevalence of teenage pregnancy in Western countries such as Canada and the UK have seen a steady decline since the 1990s. For example, in 1991 there were 61.8 children born per 1,000 teenage girls in the United States. By 2013, this number had declined to 26.6 births per 1,000 teenage girls.\nWomen and men who lived with each other without marriage sought \"palimony\" equal to the alimony. Teenagers assumed their right to a sexual life with whomever they pleased, and bathers fought to be topless or nude at beaches.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "37062", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37062", "title": "Industrial Workers of the World", "text": "International labor union\nThe Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), whose members are nicknamed \"Wobblies\", is an international labor union founded in Chicago, Illinois, United States, in 1905. Its ideology combines general unionism with industrial unionism, as it is a general union, subdivided between the various industries which employ its members. The philosophy and tactics of the IWW are described as \"revolutionary industrial unionism\", with ties to socialist, syndicalist, and anarchist labor movements.\nIn the 1910s and early 1920s, the IWW achieved many of its short-term goals, particularly in the American West, and cut across traditional guild and union lines to organize workers in a variety of trades and industries. At their peak in August 1917, IWW membership was estimated at more than 150,000, with active wings in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. However, the extremely high rate of IWW membership turnover during this era (estimated at 133% between 1905 and 1915) makes it difficult for historians to state membership totals with any certainty, as workers tended to join the IWW in large numbers for relatively short periods (\"e.g.\", during labor strikes and periods of generalized economic distress).\nMembership declined dramatically in the late 1910s and 1920s. There were conflicts with other labor groups, particularly the American Federation of Labor (AFL), which regarded the IWW as too radical, while the IWW regarded the AFL as too conservative and opposed their decision to divide workers on the basis of their trades. Membership also declined due to government crackdowns on radical, anarchist, and socialist groups during the First Red Scare after World War I. In Canada, the IWW was outlawed by the federal government by an Order in Council on September 24, 1918.\nLikely the most decisive factor in the decline in IWW membership and influence was a 1924 schism in the organization, from which the IWW never fully recovered. During the 1950s, the IWW faced near-extinction due to persecution under the Second Red Scare, although the union would later experience a resurgence in the context of the New Left in the 1960s and 1970s.\nThe IWW promotes the concept of \"One Big Union\", and contends that all workers should be united as a social class to supplant capitalism and wage labor with industrial democracy. It is known for the Wobbly Shop model of workplace democracy, through which workers elect their own managers and other forms of grassroots democracy (self-management) are implemented. The IWW does not require its members to work in a represented workplace, nor does it exclude membership in another labor union.\nUnited States.\n1905\u20131950.\nFoundation.\nThe first meeting to plan the IWW was held in Chicago in 1904. The seven attendees were Clarence Smith and Thomas J. Hagerty of the American Labor Union, George Estes and W. L. Hall of the United Brotherhood of Railway Employees, Isaac Cowan of the U.S. branch of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, William E. Trautmann of the United Brewery Workmen and Julian E. Bagley WW1 veteran and author. Eugene Debs, formerly of the American Railway Union, and Charles O. Sherman of the United Metal Workers were involved but did not attend the meeting.\nThe IWW was officially founded in Chicago, Illinois in June 1905. A convention was held of 200 socialists, anarchists, Marxists (primarily members of the Socialist Party of America and Socialist Labor Party of America), and radical trade unionists from all over the United States (mainly the Western Federation of Miners) who strongly opposed the policies of the American Federation of Labor (AFL). The IWW opposed the AFL's acceptance of capitalism and its refusal to include unskilled workers in craft unions.\nThe convention took place on June 27, 1905, and was referred to as the \"Industrial Congress\" or the \"Industrial Union Convention\". It was later known as the First Annual Convention of the IWW. In an opening speech, William D. (\"Big Bill\") Haywood declared:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This is the Continental Congress of the working class. We are here to confederate the workers of this country into a working-class movement that shall have for its purpose the emancipation of the working class from the slave bondage of capitalism.\nThe IWW's founders included Haywood, James Connolly, Daniel De Leon, Eugene V. Debs, Thomas Hagerty, Lucy Parsons, Mary Harris \"Mother\" Jones, Frank Bohn, William Trautmann, Vincent Saint John, Ralph Chaplin, and many others.\nThe IWW aimed to promote worker solidarity in the revolutionary struggle to overthrow the employing class; its motto was \"an injury to one is an injury to all\". They saw this as an improvement upon the Knights of Labor's creed, \"an injury to one is the concern of all\" which the Knights had spoken out in the 1880s. In particular, the IWW was organized because of the belief among many unionists, socialists, anarchists, Marxists, and radicals that the AFL not only had failed to effectively organize the U.S. working class, but it was causing separation rather than unity within groups of workers by organizing according to narrow craft principles. The Wobblies believed that all workers should organize as a class, a philosophy that is still reflected in the Preamble to the current IWW Constitution:\nThe working class and the employing class have nothing in common. There can be no peace so long as hunger and want are found among millions of the working people and the few, who make up the employing class, have all the good things of life.\nBetween these two classes a struggle must go on until the workers of the world organize as a class, take possession of the means of production, abolish the wage system, and live in harmony with the Earth.\nWe find that the centering of the management of industries into fewer and fewer hands makes the trade unions unable to cope with the ever growing power of the employing class. The trade unions foster a state of affairs which allows one set of workers to be pitted against another set of workers in the same industry, thereby helping defeat one another in wage wars. Moreover, the trade unions aid the employing class to mislead the workers into the belief that the working class have interests in common with their employers.\nThese conditions can be changed and the interest of the working class upheld only by an organization formed in such a way that all its members in any one industry, or in all industries if necessary, cease work whenever a strike or lockout is on in any department thereof, thus making an injury to one an injury to all.\nInstead of the conservative motto, \"A fair day's wage for a fair day's work,\" we must inscribe on our banner the revolutionary watchword, \"Abolition of the wage system.\"\nIt is the historic mission of the working class to do away with capitalism. The army of production must be organized, not only for everyday struggle with capitalists, but also to carry on production when capitalism shall have been overthrown. By organizing industrially we are forming the structure of the new society within the shell of the old.\nOne of the IWW's most important contributions to the labor movement and broader push of social justice was that, when founded, it was the only American union to welcome all workers, including women, immigrants, African Americans and Asians, into the same organization. Many of its early members were immigrants, and some, such as Carlo Tresca, Joe Hill and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, rose to prominence in the leadership. Finns formed a sizable portion of the immigrant IWW membership. \"Conceivably, the number of Finns belonging to the I.W.W. was somewhere between five and ten thousand.\" The Finnish-language newspaper of the IWW, \"Industrialisti\", published in Duluth, Minnesota, a center of the mining industry, was the union's only daily paper. At its peak, it ran 10,000 copies per issue. Another Finnish-language Wobbly publication was the monthly \"Tie Vapauteen\" (\"Road to Freedom\"). Also of note was the Finnish IWW educational institute, the Work People's College in Duluth, and the Finnish Labour Temple in Port Arthur, Ontario, Canada, which served as the IWW Canadian administration for several years. Further, many Swedish immigrants, particularly those blacklisted after the 1909 Swedish General Strike, joined the IWW and set up similar cultural institutions around the Scandinavian Socialist Clubs. This in turn exerted a political influence on the Swedish labor movement's left, that in 1910 formed the Syndicalist union SAC which soon contained a minority seeking to mimick the tactics and strategies of the IWW.\nOrganization.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe few own the many because they possess the means of livelihood of all\u00a0... The country is governed for the richest, for the corporations, the bankers, the land speculators, and for the exploiters of labor. The majority of mankind are working people. So long as their fair demands \u2013 the ownership and control of their livelihoods \u2013 are set at naught, we can have neither men's rights nor women's rights. The majority of mankind is ground down by industrial oppression in order that the small remnant may live in ease.\n \u2014 Helen Keller, IWW member, 1911\nThe IWW first attracted attention in Goldfield, Nevada, in 1906 and during the Pressed Steel Car Strike of 1909.\nBy 1912, the organization had around 25,000 members.\nGeography.\nIn its first decades, the IWW created more than 900 unions located in more than 350 cities and towns in 38 states and territories of the United States and five Canadian provinces. Throughout the country, there were 90 newspapers and periodicals affiliated with the IWW, published in 19 different languages. Cartoons were a major part of IWW publications. Produced by unpaid rank and file members they satirised the union's opponents and helped spread its messages in various forms, including 'stickerettes'. The most well-known IWW cartoon character, Mr Block, was created by Ernest Riebe and was made the subject of a Joe Hill song. Members of the IWW were active throughout the country and were involved in the Seattle General Strike of 1919, were arrested or killed in the Everett Massacre, organized among Mexican workers in the Southwest, and became a large and powerful longshoremen's union in Philadelphia.\nIWW versus AFL Carpenters, Goldfield, Nevada, 1906-1907.\nResisting IWW domination in the gold mining boom town of Goldfield, Nevada was the AFL-affiliated Carpenters Union. In March 1907, the IWW demanded that the mines deny employment to AFL Carpenters, which led mine owners to challenge the IWW. The mine owners banded together and pledged not to employ any IWW members. The mine and business owners of Goldfield staged a lockout, vowing to remain shut until they had broken the power of the IWW. The lockout prompted a split within the Goldfield workforce, between conservative and radical union members.\nHaywood trial and Western Federation of Miners exit.\nLeaders of the Western Federation of Miners such as Bill Haywood and Vincent St. John were instrumental in forming the IWW, and the WFM affiliated with the new union organization shortly after the IWW was formed. The WFM became the IWW's \"mining section\". Many in the rank and file of the WFM were uncomfortable with the open radicalism of the IWW and wanted the WFM to maintain its independence. Schisms between the WFM and IWW had emerged at the annual IWW convention in 1906, when a majority of WFM delegates walked out.\nWhen WFM executives Bill Haywood, George Pettibone, and Charles Moyer were accused of complicity in the murder of former Idaho governor Frank Steunenberg, the IWW used the case to raise funds and support and paid for the legal defense. Even the not guilty verdicts worked against the IWW, because the IWW was deprived of martyrs, and at the same time, a large portion of the public remained convinced of the guilt of the accused.\nBill Haywood for a time remained a member of both organizations. His murder trial had made Haywood a celebrity, and he was in demand as a speaker for the WFM. His increasingly radical speeches became more at odds with the WFM, and in April 1908, the WFM announced that the union had ended Haywood's role as a union representative. Haywood left the WFM and devoted all his time to organizing for the IWW.\nHistorian Vernon H. Jensen has asserted that the IWW had a \"rule or ruin\" policy, under which it attempted to wreck local unions which it could not control. From 1908 to 1921, Jensen and others have written, the IWW attempted to win power in WFM locals which had once formed the federation's backbone. When it could not do so, IWW agitators undermined WFM locals, which caused the national union to shed nearly half its membership.\nIWW versus the Western Federation of Miners.\nThe Western Federation of Miners left the IWW in 1907, but the IWW wanted the WFM back. The WFM had made up about a third of the IWW membership, and the western miners were tough union men, and good allies in a labor dispute. In 1908, Vincent St. John tried to organize a stealth takeover of the WFM. He wrote to WFM organizer Albert Ryan, encouraging him to find reliable IWW sympathizers at each WFM local, and have them appointed delegates to the annual convention by pretending to share whatever opinions of that local needed to become a delegate. Once at the convention, they could vote in a pro-IWW slate. St. Vincent promised: \"once we can control the officers of the WFM for the IWW, the big bulk of the membership will go with them.\" But the takeover did not succeed.\nAccording to several historians, the 1913 El Paso smelters' strike marked one of the first instances of direct competition between the IWW and the WFM, as the two unions competed to organize workers on strike against the American Smelting and Refining Company's local smelter. In 1914, Butte, Montana, erupted into a series of riots as miners dissatisfied with the Western Federation of Miners local at Butte formed a new union, and demanded that all miners join the new union, or be subject to beatings or worse. Although the new rival union had no affiliation with the IWW, it was widely seen as IWW-inspired. The leadership of the new union contained many who were members of the IWW or agreed with the IWW's methods and objectives. The new union failed to supplant the WFM, and the ongoing fight between the two resulted in the copper mines of Butte, longtime union strongholds for the WFM, becoming open shops, and the mine owners recognized no union from 1914 until 1934.\nVersus United Mine Workers, Scranton, Pennsylvania, 1916.\nThe IWW clashed with the United Mine Workers union in April 1916, when the IWW picketed the anthracite mines around Scranton, Pennsylvania, intending, by persuasion or force, to keep UMWA members from going to work. The IWW considered the UMWA too reactionary, because the United Mine Workers negotiated contracts with the mine owners for fixed time periods; the IWW considered that contracts hindered their revolutionary goals. In what a contemporary writer pointed out was a complete reversal of their usual policy, UMWA officials called for police to protect United Mine Workers members who wished to cross the picket lines. The Pennsylvania State Police arrived in force, prevented picket line violence, and allowed the UMWA members to peacefully pass through the IWW picket lines.\nBisbee Deportation.\nIn November 1916, the 10th convention of the IWW authorized an organizing drive in the Arizona copper mines. Copper was a vital war commodity, so mines were working day and night. During the first months of 1917, thousands joined the Metal Mine Workers' Union #800. The focus of the organizing drive was Bisbee, Arizona, a small town near the Mexican border. Nearly 5000 miners worked in Bisbee's mines. On June 27, 1917, Bisbee's miners went on strike. The strike was effective and non-violent. Demands included the doubling of pay for surface workers, most of them recent immigrants from Mexico, as well as changes in working conditions to make the mines safer. The six-hour day was raised agitationally but held in abeyance. In the early hours of July 12, hundreds of armed vigilantes rounded up nearly two thousand strikers, of whom 1186 were deported in cattle cars and dumped in the desert of New Mexico. In the following days, hundreds more were ordered to leave. The strike was broken at gunpoint.\nOther organizing drives.\nBetween 1915 and 1917, the IWW's Agricultural Workers Organization (AWO) organized more than a hundred thousand migratory farm workers throughout the Midwest and western United States.\nBuilding on the success of the AWO, the IWW's Lumber Workers Industrial Union (LWIU) used similar tactics to organize lumberjacks and other timber workers, both in the deep South and the Pacific Northwest of the United States and Canada, between 1917 and 1924. The IWW lumber strike of 1917 led to the eight-hour day and vastly improved working conditions in the Pacific Northwest. Though mid-century historians credited the US Government and \"forward thinking lumber magnates\" for agreeing to such reforms, an IWW strike forced these concessions.\nWhere the IWW did win strikes, such as in Lawrence, they often found it hard to hold onto their gains. The IWW of 1912 disdained collective bargaining agreements and preached instead the need for constant struggle against the boss on the shop floor. It proved difficult to maintain that sort of revolutionary enthusiasm against employers. In Lawrence, the IWW lost nearly all of its membership in the years after the strike, as the employers wore down their employees' resistance and eliminated many of the strongest union supporters. In 1938, the IWW voted to allow contracts with employers.\nGovernment suppression.\nThe IWW's efforts were met with \"unparalleled\" resistance from Federal, state and local governments in America; from company management and labor spies, and from groups of citizens functioning as vigilantes. In 1914, Wobbly Joe Hill (born Joel H\u00e4gglund) was accused of murder in Utah and, on what many regarded as limited and insufficient evidence, was executed in 1915. On November 5, 1916, at Everett, Washington, a group of deputized businessmen led by Sheriff Donald McRae attacked Wobblies on the steamer \"Verona\", killing at least five union members (six more were never accounted for and probably were lost in Puget Sound). Two members of the police force\u2014one a regular officer and another a deputized citizen from the National Guard Reserve\u2014were killed, probably by \"friendly fire\". At least five Everett civilians were wounded.\nMany IWW members opposed United States participation in World War I. The organization passed a resolution against the war at its convention in November 1916. This echoed the view, expressed at the IWW's founding convention, that war represents struggles among capitalists in which the rich become richer, and the working poor all too often die at the hands of other workers.\nAn IWW newspaper, the \"Industrial Worker\", wrote just before the U.S. declaration of war: \"Capitalists of America, we will fight against you, not for you! There is not a power in the world that can make the working class fight if they refuse.\" Yet when a declaration of war was passed by the U.S. Congress in April 1917, the IWW's general secretary-treasurer Bill Haywood became determined that the organization should adopt a low profile in order to avoid perceived threats to its existence. The printing of anti-war stickers was discontinued, stockpiles of existing anti-war documents were put into storage, and anti-war propagandizing ceased as official union policy. After much debate on the General Executive Board, with Haywood advocating a low profile and GEB member Frank Little championing continued agitation, Ralph Chaplin brokered a compromise agreement. A statement was issued that denounced the war, but IWW members were advised to channel their opposition through the legal mechanisms of conscription. They were advised to register for the draft, marking their claims for exemption \"IWW, opposed to war.\"\nDuring World War I, the U.S. government moved strongly against the IWW. On September 5, 1917, U.S. Department of Justice agents made simultaneous raids on dozens of IWW meeting halls across the country. Minutes books, correspondence, mailing lists, and publications were seized, with the U.S. Department of Justice removing five tons of material from the IWW's General Office in Chicago alone.\nBased in large measure on the documents seized September 5, one hundred and sixty-six IWW leaders were indicted by a Federal Grand Jury in Chicago for conspiring to hinder the draft, encourage desertion, and intimidate others in connection with labor disputes, under the new Espionage Act. One hundred and one went on trial en masse before Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis in 1918. Their lawyer was George Vanderveer of Seattle.\nIn 1917, during an incident known as the Tulsa Outrage, a group of black-robed Knights of Liberty tarred and feathered seventeen members of the IWW in Oklahoma. The attack was cited as revenge for the Green Corn Rebellion, a preemptive attack caused by fear of an impending attack on the oil fields and as punishment for not supporting the war effort. The IWW members had been turned over to the Knights of Liberty by local authorities after they were beaten, arrested at their headquarters and convicted of the crime of vagrancy. Five other men who testified in defense of the Wobblies were also fined by the court and subjected to the same torture and humiliations at the hands of the Knights of Liberty.\nIn 1919, an Armistice Day parade by the American Legion in Centralia, Washington, turned into a fight between legionnaires and IWW members in which four legionnaires were shot. Which side initiated the violence of the Centralia massacre is disputed, though there had been previous attacks on the IWW hall and businessmen's association had made threats against union members. A number of IWWs were arrested, one of whom, Wesley Everest, was lynched by a mob that night.\nA bronze plaque honoring the IWW members imprisoned and lynched following the Centralia Tragedy was dedicated in the city's George Washington Park on November 11, 2023. A request was delivered to Washington Governor Inslee requesting posthumous pardons for the eight IWW members who were convicted. A rededication was held in June 2024 after the plaque was installed on a granite block base. The color and carved style was an intentional match of the base of the American Legion memorial, The Sentinel. The $20,000 funding for the overall project, and the labor involved, was done mostly by union organizations or workers.\nOrganizational schism and aftermath.\nIWW quickly recovered from the setbacks of 1919 and 1920, with membership peaking in 1923 (58,300 estimated by dues paid per capita, though membership was likely somewhat higher as the union tolerated delinquent members). But recurring internal debates, especially between those who sought either to centralize or decentralize the organization, ultimately brought about the IWW's 1924 schism.\nThe twenties witnessed the defection of hundreds of Wobbly leaders (including Harrison George, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, John Reed, George Hardy, Charles Ashleigh, Earl Browder and, in his Soviet exile, Bill Haywood) and, following a path recounted by Fred Beal, thousands of Wobbly rank-and-filers to the Communists and Communist organizations.\nAt the beginning of the 1949 Smith Act trials, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover was disappointed when prosecutors indicted fewer CPUSA members than he had hoped, and\u2014recalling the arrests and convictions of over one hundred IWW leaders in 1917\u2014complained to the Justice Department, stating, \"the IWW as a subversive menace was crushed and has never revived. Similar action at this time would have been as effective against the Communist Party and its subsidiary organizations.\"\n1950\u20132000.\nTaft\u2013Hartley Act.\nAfter the passage of the Taft-Hartley Act in 1946 by Congress, which called for the removal of Communist union leadership, the IWW experienced a loss of membership as differences of opinion occurred over how to respond to the challenge. In 1949, US Attorney General Tom C. Clark placed the IWW on the Attorney General's List of Subversive Organizations in the category of \"organizations seeking to change the government by unconstitutional means\" under Executive Order 9835, which offered no means of appeal, and which excluded all IWW members from Federal employment and federally subsidized housing programs (this order was revoked by Executive Order 10450 in 1953).\nAt this time, the Cleveland local of the Metal and Machinery Workers Industrial Union (MMWIU) was the strongest IWW branch in the United States. Leading figures such as Frank Cedervall, who had helped build the branch up for over ten years, were concerned about the possibility of raiding from AFL-CIO unions if the IWW had its legal status as a union revoked. In 1950, Cedervall led the 1500-member MMWIU national organization to split from the IWW, as the Lumber Workers Industrial Union had almost 30 years earlier. This act did not save the MMWIU. Despite its brief affiliation with the Congress of Industrial Organizations, it was raided by the AFL and CIO and defunct by the late 1950s, less than ten years after separating from the IWW.\nThe loss of the MMWIU, at the time the IWW's largest industrial union, was almost a deathblow to the IWW. The union's membership fell to its lowest level in the 1950s during the Second Red Scare, and by 1955, the union's fiftieth anniversary, it was near extinction, though it still appeared on government lists of Communist-led groups.\n1960s rejuvenation.\nThe 1960s civil rights movement, anti-war protests, and various university student movements brought new life to the IWW, albeit with many fewer new members than the great organizing drives of the early part of the 20th century.\nThe first signs of new life for the IWW in the 1960s were organizing efforts among students in San Francisco and Berkeley, which were hotbeds of student radicalism at the time. This targeting of students resulted in a Bay Area branch of the union with over a hundred members in 1964, almost as many as the union's total membership in 1961. Wobblies old and new united for one more \"free speech fight\": Berkeley's Free Speech Movement. Riding on this high, the decision in 1967 to allow college and university students to join the Education Workers Industrial Union (IU 620) as full members spurred campaigns in 1968 at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, the University of Wisconsin\u2013Milwaukee, and the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. The IWW sent representatives to Students for a Democratic Society conventions in 1967, 1968, and 1969, and as the SDS collapsed into infighting, the IWW gained members fleeing this discord. These changes had a profound effect on the union, which by 1972 had 67% of members under the age of 30, with a total of nearly 500 members.\nThe IWW's links to the 1960s counterculture led to organizing campaigns at counterculture businesses, as well as a wave of over two dozen co-ops affiliating with the IWW under its Wobbly Shop model in the 1960s to 1980s. These businesses were primarily in printing, publishing, and food distribution, from underground newspapers and radical print shops to community co-op grocery stores. Some of the printing and publishing industry co-ops and job shops included Black &amp; Red (Detroit), Glad Day Press (New York), RPM Press (Michigan), New Media Graphics (Ohio), Babylon Print (Wisconsin), Hill Press (Illinois), Lakeside (Madison, Wisconsin), Harbinger (Columbia, South Carolina), Eastown Printing in Grand Rapids, Michigan (where the IWW negotiated a contract in 1978), and (Montreal). This close affiliation with radical publishers and printing houses sometimes led to legal difficulties for the union, such as when was shut down in 1970 by provincial police for publishing pro-FLQ materials, which were banned at the time under an official censorship law. Also in 1970, the San Diego, California, \"street journal\" became an official IWW shop. In 1971 its office was attacked by an organization calling itself the Minutemen, and IWW member Ricardo Gonzalves was indicted for criminal syndicalism along with two members of the Brown Berets.\nReturn to workplace campaigns.\nInvigorated by the arrival of enthusiastic new members, the IWW began a wave of organizing drives. These largely took a regional form and they, as well as the union's overall membership, concentrated in Portland, Chicago, Ann Arbor, and throughout the state of California, which when combined accounted for over half of union drives from 1970 to 1979. In Portland, Oregon, the IWW led campaigns at Winter Products (a brass plating plant) in 1972, at a local Winchell's Donuts (where a strike was waged and lost), at the Albina Day Care (where key union demands were won, including the firing of the director of the day care), of healthcare workers at West Side School and the Portland Medical Center, and of agricultural workers in 1974. The latter effort led to the opening of an IWW union hall in Portland to compete with extortionate hiring halls and day labor agencies. Organizing efforts led to a growth in membership, but repeated loss of strikes and organizing campaigns anticipated the decline of the Portland branch after the mid-1970s, a stagnancy period lasting until the 1990s.\nIn California, union activities were based in Santa Cruz, where in 1977 the IWW engaged in one of its most ambitious campaigns of the 1970s: an attempt in 1977 to organize 3,000 workers hired under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) in Santa Cruz County. The campaign led to pay raises, the implementation of a grievance procedure, and medical and dental coverage, but the union failed to maintain its foothold, and in 1982 the CETA program was replaced by the Job Training Partnership Act. The IWW won some lasting victories in Santa Cruz, such as campaigns at the Janus Alcohol Recovery Center, the Santa Cruz Law Center, Project Hope, and the Santa Cruz Community Switchboard.\nElsewhere in California, the IWW was active in Long Beach in 1972, where it organized workers at International Wood Products and Park International Corporation (a manufacturer of plastic swimming pool filters) and went on strike after the firing of one worker for union-related activities. Finally, in San Francisco, the IWW ran campaigns for radio station and food service workers.\nIn Chicago, the IWW was an early opponent of so-called urban renewal programs and supported the creation of the \"Chicago People's Park\" in 1969. The Chicago branch also ran citywide campaigns for healthcare, food service, entertainment, construction, and metal workers, and its success with the latter led to an attempt to revive the national Metal and Machinery Workers Industrial Union, which twenty years earlier had been a major component of the union. Metalworker organizing mostly ended in 1978 after a failed strike at Mid-American Metal in Virden, Illinois. The IWW also became one of the first unions to try to organize fast food workers, with an organizing campaign at a local McDonald's in 1973.\nThe IWW also built on its existing presence in Ann Arbor, which had existed since student organizing began at the University of Michigan, to launch an organizing campaign at the University Cellar, a college bookstore. The union won National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) certification there in 1979 following a strike, and the store became a strong job shop for the union until it was closed in 1986. The union launched a similar campaign at another local bookstore, Charing Cross Books, but was unable to maintain its foothold there despite reaching a settlement with management.\nIn the late 1970s, the IWW came to regional prominence in entertainment industry organizing, with an Entertainment Workers Organizing Committee being founded in Chicago in 1976, followed by campaigns organizing musicians in Cleveland in 1977 and Ann Arbor in 1978. The Chicago committee published a model contract which was distributed to musicians in the hopes of raising industry standards, as well as maintaining an active phone line for booking information. IWW musicians such as Utah Phillips, Faith Petric, Bob Bovee, and Jim Ringer also toured and promoted the union, and in 1987 an anthology album, \"Rebel Voices\", was released.\nOther IWW organizing campaigns of the 1970s included a ShopRite supermarket in Milwaukee, at Coronet Foods in Wheeling, West Virginia, chemical and fast food workers (including KFC and Roy Rogers) in State College, Pennsylvania, and hospital workers in Boston, all in 1973; shipyards in Houston, Texas, and restaurant workers in Pittsburgh in 1974; unsuccessful campaigns at the Prospect Nursing Home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and a Pizza Hut in Arkadelphia, Arkansas, in 1975; and a construction workers organizing drive in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in 1978.\n1990s.\nIn 1996, the IWW launched an organizing drive against Borders Books in Philadelphia. In March, the union lost an NLRB certification vote by a narrow margin but continued to organize. In June, IWW member Miriam Fried was fired on trumped-up charges and a national boycott of Borders was launched in response. IWW members picketed at Borders stores nationwide, including Ann Arbor, Michigan; Washington, D.C.; San Francisco, California; Miami, Florida; Chicago, Illinois; Palo Alto, California; Portland, Oregon; Portland, Maine; Boston, Massachusetts; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Albany, New York; Richmond, Virginia; St. Louis, Missouri; Los Angeles, California; and other cities. This was followed up with a National Day of Action in 1997, where Borders stores were again picketed nationwide, and a second organizing campaign in London, England.\nAlso in 1996, the IWW began organizing at Wherehouse Music in El Cerrito, California. The campaign continued until 1997, when management fired two organizers and laid off over half the employees, as well as reducing the hours of known union members. This directly affected the NLRB certification vote which followed, where the IWW lost over 2:1.\nIn 1998, the IWW chartered a San Francisco branch of the Marine Transport Workers Industrial Union (MTWIU), which trained hundreds of waterfront workers in health and safety techniques and attempted to institutionalize these safety practices on the San Francisco waterfront.\n2000\u2013present.\nTotal Members (legal records)\n \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0UK Certification Officer\nIn 2004, an IWW union was organized in a New York City Starbucks. In 2006, the IWW continued efforts at Starbucks by organizing several Chicago area shops.\nIn New York City, the IWW has organized immigrant foodstuffs workers since 2005. That summer, workers from Handyfat Trading joined the IWW, and were soon followed by workers from four more warehouses.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe Wobblies are back. Many young radicals find the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) the most congenial available platform on which to stand in trying to change the world.\n \u2014 Staughton Lynd, 2014.\nIn May 2007, the NYC warehouse workers came together with the Starbucks Workers Union to form The Food and Allied Workers Union IU 460/640. In the summer of 2007, the IWW organized workers at two new warehouses: Flaum Appetizing, a Kosher food distributor, and Wild Edibles, a seafood company. Over the course of 2007\u201308, workers at both shops were illegally terminated for their union activity. In 2008, the workers at Wild Edibles actively fought to get their jobs back and to secure overtime pay owed to them by the boss. In a workplace justice campaign called Focus on the Food Chain, carried out jointly with Brandworkers International, the IWW workers won settlements against employers including Pur Pac, Flaum Appetizing and Wild Edibles.\nThe Portland, Oregon General Membership Branch is one of the largest and most active branches of the IWW. The branch holds three contracts currently, two with Janus Youth Programs and one with Portland Women's Crisis Line. There has been some debate within the branch about whether or not union contracts such as this are desirable in the long run, with some members favoring solidarity unionism as opposed to contract unionism and some members believing there is room for both strategies for organizing. The branch has successfully supported workers wrongfully fired from several different workplaces in the last two years. Due to picketing by Wobblies, these workers have received significant compensation from their former employers. Branch membership has been increasing, as has shop organizing. As of 2005, the 100th anniversary of its founding, the IWW had around 5,000 members, compared to 13 million members in the AFL-CIO.\n2011 Wisconsin general strike.\nIn early 2011, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker announced a budget bill which the IWW held would effectively outlaw unions for state or municipal workers. In response, there was an emergency meeting of the Midwestern IWW member organizations. IWW members presented a proposal at a meeting of South-Central Federation of Labor (SCFL) which endorsed a general strike and create an ad hoc Committee to instruct affiliated locals in preparations for the general strike. The IWW proposal passed nearly unanimously. The Madison branch made an international appeal translating various materials concerning the strike into Arabic, French, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese. An appeal was made to European unions (CNT \u2013 Spain, CGT \u2013 Spain and CGT \u2013 France) to send organizers to Madison who could present their experience of general strikes at union meetings and help organize the strike in other ways. The CNT (France) sent letters of solidarity to the IWW. This was considered the largest and most successful intervention in a working-class struggle that the IWW has undertaken since the 1930s. In the aftermath, the strike was said by some to be \"the general strike that didn't happen\" because eventually ongoing efforts at industrial action were \"completely overwhelmed by the recall effort\" against the governor during the crisis.\nLate 2010s.\nIn the mid-2010s, Wobblies in the United States were focused on campaigns to organize the multinational coffeehouse chain Starbucks, the franchised sandwich fast food restaurant chain Jimmy John's, and the multinational supermarket chain Whole Foods Market. The union had about 3,000 members. The IWW moved its headquarters to 2036 West Montrose, Chicago, in 2012.\nThe IWW waged an organizing campaign at Chicago-Lake Liquors in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 2013. The store, which advertises itself as the highest-volume liquor store in Minnesota, had a wage cap of $10.50 per hour, but in the face of IWW demands for the wage cap to be lifted, store management fired five organizers. On April 6, the Twin Cities branch of the union responded with a picket around the store informing customers of the situation. This was followed by a second picket on May 4, a day which customarily had heavy business at the store. The union claimed to have made \"what should have been an extremely busy Saturday into a quiet afternoon inside the store\". After several months, the National Labor Relations Board announced that it found merit in the union's unfair dismissal complaint. As a result, the union and store management agreed to a $32,000 settlement as a form of compensation to the fired workers and the campaign officially ended.\nWorkers at the Paulo Freire Social Justice Charter School in Holyoke, Massachusetts were organized with the IWW in 2015, hoping to address the \"authoritarian leadership\" of the school administration and perceived racial bias in hiring.\nOn September 14, 2015, after a year-long organizing campaign, workers at Sound Stage Production in North Haven Connecticut declared their membership in the IWW.\nThe IWW announced the Burgerville Workers Union (BVWU) in April 2016, which focuses on workers at the Oregon regional fast food chain, Burgerville. A subsidiary of the IWW, the BVWU went public on April 26 at a rally of workers and supporters outside a Portland, Oregon Burgerville location. Upon going public, the BVWU was endorsed by a number of local Oregon community organizations, including union locals, the Portland Solidarity Network, and food and racial justice organizations. It was also endorsed by then-Democratic presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders. The union received pushback with a letter from Burgerville's CEO, Jeff Harvey, being distributed to workers discouraging them from joining the union. In June 2017, Burgerville paid a settlement of $10,000 after an investigation by the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries, which found that the company had violated state-mandated break periods for workers. In April and May 2018 the IWW won NLRB elections in 2 Burgerville Locations.\nIn August 2016, workers at Ellen's Stardust Diner in Manhattan formed Stardust Family United (SFU) under the IWW, driven by the firing of thirty employees, as well as an unpopular new scheduling system. After going public, the union accused Stardust management of retaliatory firings and posting anti-union materials in the restaurant.\nOn September 9, 2016, the 45th anniversary of the Attica Prison Riots, 900 incarcerated workers organized by the IWW and many other prisoners participated in the 9/9 National Prison Strike declared by the IWW's Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee. Supported by a number of anti-incarceration and prisoners' organizations such as the Free Alabama Movement, the strike focused on the poor conditions in many American prisons and the low rates of prisoner pay for maintaining prisons and engaging in commercial production of goods for third-party companies. The strike affected an estimated twenty prisons in eleven states and was strongest at the William C. Holman Correctional Facility in Alabama. Estimates of the number of inmates affected range from 20,000, to 50,000, to as high as 72,000, with David Fathi of the ACLU National Prison Project judging it to be the \"largest prisoner strike in recent memory\". Initial media coverage was slow, with strike organizers complaining of a \"mainstream-media blackout\", which could be attributed to the difficulty in communicating with prisoners, as many prisons went on lockdown either in response to prisoner strike activity or in anticipation of it.\nCOVID-19 pandemic.\nThe IWW also organized workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. In May 2020 the IWW established the Voodoo Doughnut Workers Union (DWU) in Portland. The newly formed union delivered a letter to management announcing the formation of a union and demanding higher wages, safety improvements and severance packages for employees laid off because of the coronavirus and Oregon's ongoing \"shelter-in-place\" order. In February 2021, after months of organizing, DWU workers officially filed for a union certification election with the National Labor Relations Board.\nThe IWW also publicly announced the Second Staff (2S) workers' union in May 2020 at the Faison school, a private school serving students on the autism spectrum in Richmond, Virginia, in response to what the union called a \"reckless endangerment of staff and students\" in trying to force the school to open too soon. March 2021 saw a rash of organizing with the IWW. On March 9, workers at Moe's Books, an independent used bookstore in Berkeley, California, announced that they received voluntary recognition from Moe's Books management, officially unionizing with the IWW.\nShortly after, on March 13, the IWW announced that it was organizing workers at the Socialist Rifle Association (SRA). The union was voluntarily recognized by the SRA the following day. Two days later, on March 16, staff at the Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition (OVEC) announced their intent to unionize with the IWW, and requested voluntary recognition from management. In organizing, the OVEC workers seek to gain \"a standardized pay scale, an equitable discipline policy, and the right to union representation at any meeting wherein matters affecting staff pay, hours, benefits, advancement, or layoffs may be discussed or voted on\".\nThe IWW is the first union in the United States to ratify a union contract for fast food workers. Five Oregon locations of Burgerville are unionized, as well as one location of Voodoo Doughnut in downtown Portland.\nAustralia.\nAustralia encountered the IWW tradition early. In part, this was due to the local De Leonist Socialist Labor Party following the industrial turn of the US SLP. The SLP formed an IWW Club in Sydney in October 1907. Members of other socialist groups also joined it, and the relationship with the SLP soon proved to be a problem. The 1908 split between the Chicago and Detroit factions in the United States was echoed by internal unrest in the Australian IWW from late 1908, resulting in the formation of a pro-Chicago local in Adelaide in May 1911 and another in Sydney six months later. By mid-1913 the \"Chicago\" IWW was flourishing and the SLP-associated pro-Detroit IWW Club in decline. In 1916 the \"Detroit\" IWW in Australia followed the lead of the US body and renamed itself the Workers' International Industrial Union.\nThe IWW opposed the First World War from 1914 onward and in many ways fought against Australian conscription. A narrow majority of Australians voted against conscription in a very bitter hard-fought referendum in October 1916, and then again in December 1917, Australia being the only belligerent in World War One without conscription. In very significant part this was due to the agitation of the IWW, a group which never had as many as 500 members in Australia at its peak. The IWW founded the Anti-Conscription League (ACL) in which members worked with the broader labor and peace movement, and also carried on an aggressive propaganda campaign in its own name; leading to the imprisonment of Tom Barker (1887\u20131970) the editor of the IWW paper \"Direct Action\", sentenced to twelve months in March 1916. A series of arson attacks on commercial properties in Sydney was widely attributed to the IWW campaign to have Tom Barker released. He was released in August 1916, but twelve mostly prominent IWW activists, the so-called Sydney Twelve were arrested in NSW in September 1916 for arson and other offenses. Their trial and eventual imprisonment became a \"cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre\" of the Australian labor movement, which saw no convincing evidence of their involvement. A number of other scandals were associated with the IWW; a five-pound note forgery scandal, the so-called Tottenham tragedy in which the murder of a police officer was blamed on the IWW, and above all it was blamed for the defeat of the October 1916 conscription referendum. In December 1916, the Commonwealth government led by Labour Party renegade Billy Hughes declared the IWW an illegal organization under the Unlawful Associations Act. Eighty six members immediately defied the law and were sentenced to six months imprisonment. \"Direct Action\" was suppressed, its circulation was at its peak of something over 12,000. During the war over 100 members Australia-wide were sentenced to imprisonment on political charges, including the veteran activist Monty Miller.\nBy the early 1930s, most Australian IWW branches had dispersed as the Communist Party grew in influence.\nThe Australian IWW has grown since the 1940s, but have been unsuccessful in securing union representation. As an extreme example of the integration of ex-IWW militants into the mainstream labor movement one might instance the career of Donald Grant, one of the Sydney Twelve sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment for conspiracy to commit arson and other crimes. Released from prison in August 1920, he soon broke with the IWW over its antipolitical stand, standing for the NSW Parliament for the Industrial Socialist Labour Party unsuccessfully in 1922 and then in 1925 for the mainstream Australian Labor Party (ALP) also unsuccessfully. This reconciliation with the ALP and the electoral system did not prevent him being imprisoned again in 1927 for street demonstrations supporting Sacco and Vanzetti. He eventually represented the ALP in the NSW Legislative Council in 1931\u20131940 and the Australian Senate 1943\u20131956.\n\"Bump Me Into Parliament\" is the most notable Australian IWW song, and is still current. It was written by ship's fireman William \"Bill\" Casey, later Secretary of the Seaman's Union in Queensland.\nNew Zealand.\nAustralian influence was strong in early 20th century left-wing groups, and several founders of the New Zealand Labour Party (e.g. Bob Semple) were from Australia. The trans-Tasman interchange was two-way, particularly for miners. Several Tasmanian Labour \"groupings\" in the 1890s cited their earlier New Zealand experience of activism e.g. later premier Robert Cosgrove, and also Chris Watson from New South Wales.\n\"Wobbly\" activists in New Zealand pre-WWI were John Benjamin King and H. M. Fitzgerald (an adherent of the De Leon school) from Canada. Another was Robert Rivers La Monte from America, who was (briefly) an organizer for the New Zealand Socialist Party (as was Fitzgerald). IWW strongholds were Auckland \"a city with the demographic characteristics of a frontier town\"; Wellington where a branch survived briefly and in mining towns, on the wharves and among laborers.\nCanada.\nThe IWW was active in Canada from a very early point in the organization's history, especially in Western Canada, primarily in British Columbia. The union was active in organizing large swaths of the lumber and mining industry along the coast, in the Interior of British Columbia, and Vancouver Island. Joe Hill wrote the song \"Where the Fraser River Flows\" during this period when the IWW was organizing in British Columbia. Some members of the IWW had relatively close links with the Socialist Party of Canada. Canadians who went to Australia and New Zealand before WWI included John Benjamin King and H. M. Fitzgerald (an adherent of the De Leon school).\nThe IWW was banned as a subversive organization in Canada during the First World War (and partially replaced by the One Big Union). After being unbanned after the war, the IWW reached a post-WWI high of 5600 Canadian members in 1923. The union entered a short \"golden age\" in Canada with an official Canadian Administration located at the Finnish Labour Temple in Port Arthur (now Thunder Bay, Ontario) and a strong base among immigrant laborers in Northern Ontario and Manitoba, especially Finns, which included harvest workers, lumberjacks, and miners. During this period, the IWW competed for members with a number of other radical and socialist organizations such as the Finnish Organization of Canada (FOC), with the IWW's \"Industrialisti\" newspaper competing with the FOC's \"Vapaus\" for attention and readership. During this period. Membership slowly decreased during the 1920s and 30s despite continued organizing and strike activity as the IWW lost ground to the One Big Union and Communist Party-controlled organizations such as the Workers' Unity League (WUL). Despite this competition, the IWW and WUL cooperated during strikes, such as at the Abitibi Pulp &amp; Paper Company near Sault Ste. Marie in 1933, where the Finnish workers in the IWW and WUL faced discrimination and violence from the Anglo citizens of the town. The IWW also successfully unionized Ritchie's Dairy in Toronto and formed a fishery workers' branch in MacDiarmid (now Greenstone, Ontario).\nIn 1936, the IWW in Canada supported the Spanish Revolution and recruited for the militia of the anarcho-syndicalist (CNT), in direct conflict with Communist Party recruiters for the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion. The disagreement caused violent clashes at recruitment rallies in Northern Ontario. Several Canadian IWW members were killed in the Spanish Civil War and the CNT's ensuing defeat at the hands of both Fascist and Republican forces. \nIn 2009, after Starbucks established policies that meant demotions and wage cuts for some workers, IWW branches in Montreal and Sherbrooke helped found the Starbucks Workers' Union (STTS), which made a breakthrough in Quebec City at an establishment in Sainte-Foy. Leaders Simon Gosselin, Dominic Dupont and Andrew Fletcher were harassed in the months following unionization, and union efforts were defeated by law firm Heenan Blaike in a series of hearings before Quebec Labor Relations Board.\nToday the IWW is active in Canada, with branches in Vancouver, Vancouver Island, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Ottawa/Outaouais, Toronto, Windsor, Sherbrooke, Qu\u00e9bec City and Montr\u00e9al. In August 2009, Canadian members voted to ratify the constitution of the Canadian Regional Organizing Committee (CanROC) to improve inter-branch coordination and communication. Affiliated branches are Winnipeg, Ottawa-Outaouais, Toronto, Windsor, Sherbrooke, Montr\u00e9al, and Qu\u00e9bec City. Each branch elects a representative to make decisions on the Canadian board. There were originally three officers, the Secretary-Treasurer, Organizing Department Liaison, and Editor of the Canadian Organizing Bulletin. In 2016, CanROC members voted to split the Secretary-Treasurer role into separate Regional Secretary and Regional Treasurer positions.\nThere are currently five job shops in Canada: Libra Knowledge and Information Services Co-op in Toronto, ParIT Workers Cooperative in Winnipeg, the Windsor Button Collective, the Ottawa Panhandlers' Union, and the Street Labourers of Windsor (SLOW). The Ottawa Panhandlers' Union continues a tradition in the IWW of expanding the definition of worker. The union members include anyone who makes their living in the street, including buskers, street vendors, the homeless, scrappers, and panhandlers. In the summer of 2004, the Union led a strike by the homeless (the Homeless Action Strike) in Ottawa. The strike resulted in the city agreeing to fund a newspaper created and sold by the homeless on the street. On May 1, 2006, the Union took over the Elgin Street Police Station for a day. A similar IWW organization, the Street Labourers of Windsor (SLOW), has garnered local, provincial, and national news coverage for its organizing efforts in 2015.\nEurope.\nGermany, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Austria.\nThe IWW started to organize in Germany following the First World War. Fritz Wolffheim played a significant role in establishing the IWW in Hamburg. A German Language Membership Regional Organizing Committee (GLAMROC) was founded in December 2006 in Cologne. It encompasses the German-language area of Germany, Luxembourg, Austria, and Switzerland with branches or contacts in 16 cities.\nGreat Britain and Ireland.\nThe regional body of the union in the United Kingdom and Ireland is the Wales, Ireland, Scotland, England Regional Administration (WISERA). Formerly known as the Britain and Ireland Regional Administration (BIRA), its name was changed as a result of a referendum vote by WISERA members.\nThe IWW was present, to varying extents, in many of the struggles of the early decades of the 20th century, including the UK general strike of 1926 and the dockers' strike of 1947. During the Spanish Civil War, a Wobbly from Neath, who had been active in Mexico, trained volunteers in preparation for the journey to Spain, where they joined the International Brigades to fight against Franco.\nOverall, membership has increased rapidly; in 2014, the union reported a total UK membership of 750, which increased to 1000 by April 2015.\nAlso in 2007, IWW branches in Glasgow and Dumfries were a key driving force in a successful campaign to prevent the closure of one of Glasgow University's campuses (The Crichton) in Dumfries.\nThe Edinburgh General Membership Branch of the IWW along with other branches of the IWW's Scottish section voted in 2014 to become a signatory to the \"From Yes to Action Statement\" produced by the Autonomous Centre of Edinburgh. In 2015, along with similar groups such as the Edinburgh Coalition Against Poverty and Edinburgh Anarchist Federation, they joined the Scottish Action Against Austerity network.\nIn 2016, WISERA promoted a campaign targeting couriers working for companies such as Deliveroo.\nWISERA currently has campaigns organising TEFL teachers, brewery workers and escape room workers.\nIceland and Greece.\nAn Iceland Regional Organizing Committee (IceROC) was chartered in 2015. The union has become a trailblazer in supporting sex workers in Iceland, who lack access to services which do not automatically treat them as victims of abuse.\nAlso in 2015, a Greek Regional Organizing Committee (GreROC) was chartered. In July of that year, it released a statement condemning the Greek government's response to the results of the 2015 Greek bailout referendum, saying that \"despite the Left tone of dignity that the Left governmental administrators use, this is a one-way blackmail. We need a radical change of shift, not in words but in action.\"\nFolk music and protest songs.\nOne Wobbly characteristic since their inception has been a penchant for song. To counteract management sending in the Salvation Army band to cover up the Wobbly speakers, Joe Hill wrote parodies of Christian hymns so that union members could sing along with the Salvation Army band, but with their own purposes. For example, \"In the Sweet By and By\" became \"There'll Be Pie in the Sky When You Die (That's a Lie)\". From that start in exigency, Wobbly song writing became common because they \"articulated the frustrations, hostilities, and humor of the homeless and the dispossessed.\"\nLiterature.\nKarl Marlantes's 2019 novel \"Deep River\" explores labor issues in the early 1900s in the US and the consequences for an immigrant Finnish family. The book focuses on a female family member who becomes an organizer for the IWW in the dangerous logging industry. Both pro- and anti-labor viewpoints are examined, with special attention given to IWW strikes and the backlash against the labor movement during World War I.\nLingo.\nWobbly lingo is a collection of technical language, jargon, and historic slang used by the Wobblies, for more than a century. Many Wobbly terms derive from or are coextensive with hobo expressions used through the 1940s. The origin of the name \"Wobbly\" itself is uncertain. For several decades, many hobos in the United States were members of, or were sympathetic to, the IWW. Because of this, some of the terms describe the life of a hobo such as \"riding the rails\", living in \"jungles\", dodging the \"bulls\". The IWW's efforts to organize all trades allowed the lingo to expand to include terms relating to mining camps, timber work, and farming.\nSome words and phrases believed to have originated within Wobbly lingo have gained cultural significance outside of the IWW. For example, from Joe Hill's song \"The Preacher and the Slave\", the expression pie in the sky has passed into common usage, referring to a \"preposterously optimistic goal\".\nNotable members.\nFormer lieutenant governor of Colorado David C. Coates was a labor militant, and was present at the founding convention, although it is unknown if he became a member. It has long been rumored, but not proven, that baseball legend Honus Wagner was also a Wobbly. Senator Joseph McCarthy accused Edward R. Murrow of having been an IWW member, which Murrow denied. \nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

L.\u00a0, 110\u00a0Stat.\u00a0https://, enacted , was introduced to the United States Congress in April 1995 as a Senate Bill (). The bill was passed with broad bipartisan support by Congress in response to the bombings of the World Trade Center and Oklahoma City. It was signed into law by President Bill Clinton.\nControversial for its changes to the law of habeas corpus in the United States, the AEDPA also contained a number of provisions to \"deter terrorism, provide justice for victims, provide for an effective death penalty, and for other purposes.\"\nBackground.\nOn February 10, 1995, Senator Joe Biden introduced the Omnibus Counterterrorism Act of 1995 to the United States Senate. Just as with its successor, the omnibus bill was introduced on behalf of the Clinton Administration. In the two months that the bill was debated in the Senate, little progress was made towards passage.\nFollowing the Oklahoma City bombing on April 19, 1995, a new antiterrorism bill was introduced to the Senate by Republican Senate Majority leader Bob Dole. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 was introduced on April 27, 1995. Although the bill was promoted as an urgent measure, it remained stalled in Congress between December 1995 until March of 1996. It would not see further Congressional activity until March of 1996.\nThe act was codified in sections of Title 8, Title 18 and Title 28. The law amended the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act to allow US citizens to file civil lawsuits against some foreign countries when Americans were killed in terrorist attacks. It authorized the State Department to designate foreign terrorist organizations.\nWithin days of the AEDPA being introduced, there were disagreements between Republican and Democratic leadership over combining federal habeas corpus reform with the anti-terrorism law. Republicans refused to negotiate with Congressional democrats and fast-tracked the bill without a report. Legal analysts note that the exaggerated urgency following the Oklahoma City bombing has tended to obscure the legislative history. Some of the changes to restrict \"de novo\" hearings in federal courts have been controversial. \nIn 1998 Antonin Scalia commented that the purpose of AEDPA was \"to streamline and simplify [habeas corpus]\". President Clinton acknowledged that \"it should not take eight or nine years and three trips to the Supreme Court to finalize whether a person, in fact, was properly convicted or not\". However, in his signing statement, he noted his strong objections to changes made to immigration statutes that eliminated relief for legal residents with minor drug convictions : \"[AEDPA] makes a number of major ill-advised changes in our immigration laws having nothing to do with fighting terrorism.\" He did not want the anti-terrorism bill to stall over divisive additions. Instead of vetoing the bill, his administration pursued legislative options to countermand these draconian changes.\nAEDPA eventually passed with bipartisan support. The final vote in Senate was 91-8 and in the House of Representatives 293-133. It was signed into law on April 24, 1996.\nProvisions.\nTitle I - Habeas Corpus Reform.\nChanges filing deadlines and limits appeals for death penalty cases. For more see Habeas Corpus.\nTitle II - Justice for Victims.\nThis section provides for mandatory victim restitution, alters jurisdiction for lawsuits against terrorist states, and expands assistance for victims of terrorism.\nTitle III - International Terrorism Prohibitions.\nOne of the sections included in the bill as originally introduced, this section received broad bipartisan support from the beginning. It prohibits international terrorist fundraising, gives authority to the Secretary of State to designate foreign organizations as terrorist organizations, allows criminal prosecution of anyone found to be providing funding to any organization linked to a designated terrorist organization. Prohibits assistance to terrorist states, including military aid and assistance from international financial institutions.\nTitle IV - Terrorist and Criminal Alien Removal and Exclusion.\nProvides for the removal of alien terrorists, the exclusion of members and representatives of terrorist organizations, modifies asylum procedures to allow denial of asylum to members of terrorist organizations, and alters criminal procedures for aliens.\nIn altering the criminal procedures for aliens, the law created a new system of secret evidence which allows the government to introduce classified information as evidence without disclosing the specifics of the evidence to the alien or their legal counsel. It also expands the criteria for deportation for crimes of moral turpitude.\nTitle V - Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Weapons Restrictions.\nDefines and expands restrictions on certain types of nuclear materials, biological weapons, and chemical weapons.\nTitle VI - Implementation of Plastic Explosives Convention.\nCodifies the Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives requirement that all plastic explosives be equipped with detection agents and creates criminal sanctions for failure to comply. \nTitle VII - Criminal Law Modifications to Counter Terrorism.\nChanges to criminal law involving terrorist (or explosives) offenses, including increased penalties and criminal procedure changes. Commissioning a study to determine the constitutionality of restrictions on bomb-making materials.\nTitle VIII - Assistance to Law Enforcement.\nProvides additional resources and training for law enforcement including overseas training activities, additional requirements to preserve record evidence, and a commissioned study and report of electronic surveillance. Directed resources towards combatting international counterfeiting of U.S. currency, compiling statistics relating to the intimidation of government employees, and assessing and reducing the threat to law enforcement officers from the criminal use of firearms and ammunition. Also created the Commission on the Advancement of Federal Law Enforcement (Subtitle A).\nIncreased funding authorizations for law enforcement including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service, and more.\nTitle IX - Miscellaneous.\nExpanded the territorial sea, changed proof of citizenship requirements, and limited legal representation fees and expenses in capital cases.\nHabeas corpus.\nAEDPA had a significant impact on the law of habeas corpus. Section 104(d) limits the power of federal courts to grant habeas corpus relief to state prisoners unless the state court's adjudication of the claim resulted in a decision that was \nIn addition to the modifications that pertain to all habeas corpus cases, AEDPA enacted special review provisions for capital cases from states that enacted quality controls for the performance of counsel in the state courts in the post-conviction phase. States that enacted the quality controls would see strict time limitations enforced against their death-row inmates in federal habeas proceedings coupled with extremely deferential review to the determinations of their courts regarding issues of federal law. Arizona became the first state to successfully opt-in to this provision in 2020.\nOther provisions of AEDPA created entirely new statutory law. For example, the judicially-created abuse-of-the-writ doctrine, established in \"McCleskey v. Zant\" (1991), had restricted the presentation of new claims through subsequent habeas petitions. AEDPA replaced this doctrine with a stricter bar on \"second or successive petitions\" (sec. 106).\nPetitioners in federal habeas proceedings that have already been decided in a previous habeas petition would find the claims barred. Additionally, petitioners who had already filed a federal habeas petition were required to first secure authorization from the appropriate federal court of appeals. Furthermore, AEDPA took away from the Supreme Court the power to review a court of appeals's denial of that permission, thus placing final authority for the filing of second petitions in the hands of the federal courts of appeals.\nThe unanimous 8-0 Supreme Court decision \"Harrington v. Richter\" held that petitioners attempting to overcome the \u00a72254(d) bar to federal review must show that the decision to deny habeas is unreasonable even when the state court provides only a summary ruling. \"Cullen v. Pinholster\" held that federal courts reviewing \"\"Strickland\" claims\" under AEDPA were limited to deciding whether the state decision was reasonable based on the record.\nCourt cases.\nSoon after it was enacted, AEDPA endured a critical test in the Supreme Court. The basis of the challenge was that the provisions limiting the ability of persons to file successive habeas petitions violated Article I, Section 9, Clause 2, of the United States Constitution, the Suspension Clause. The Supreme Court held unanimously, in \"Felker v. Turpin\", 518 U.S. https:// (1997), that the limitations did not unconstitutionally suspend the writ.\nIn 2005, the Ninth Circuit indicated that it was willing to consider a challenge to the constitutionality of AEDPA on separation of powers grounds under \"City of Boerne v. Flores\" and \"Marbury v. Madison\", but it has since decided that the issue had been settled by circuit precedent.\nBasketball player and later coach Steve Kerr and his siblings and mother sued the Iranian government under the Act for the 1984 killing of Kerr's father, Malcolm H. Kerr, in Beirut, Lebanon.\nOn June 21, 2022, the Supreme Court reinforced in \"Shoop v. Twyford\" that the power of federal courts to grant habeas corpus is restricted by AEDPA.\nOn June 12, 2025, the Supreme Court ruled in \"Rivers v. Guerrero\": \"Once a district court enters its judgment with respect to a first-filed habeas petition, a second-in-time filing qualifies as a 'second or successive application' properly subject to the requirements of https:// \u00a72244(b)].\"\nReception.\nWhile the act has several titles and provisions, the majority of criticism stems from the act's tightening of habeas corpus laws. Those in favor of the bill say that the act prevents those convicted of crimes from being able to \"thwart justice and avoid just punishment by filing frivolous appeals for years on end\", while critics argue that the inability to make multiple appeals increases the risk of an innocent person being killed.\nTitle IV also received criticism following the enactment of the AEDPA. The section allowing a single Immigration and Naturalization officer to decide whether to offer asylum to an individual who claims persecution but does not have identification was specifically targeted. The provision extending the ability of officers to deport anyone who illegally entered the country at any point in time without a hearing before a judge was also criticized.\nOther, more recent criticism centers on the deference that the law requires of federal judges in considering habeas petitions. In \"Sessoms v. Grounds\" (Ninth Circuit), the majority of the judges believed that the state erred in not throwing out testimony made in the absence of the defendant's attorney after he had requested counsel, but they were required to overturn his appeal. The dissenting opinion said that federal courts can only grant habeas relief if \"there is no possibility fair-minded jurists could disagree that the state court's decision conflicts with [the Supreme] Court's precedents\".\nLara Bazelon argues this lack of power for judicial relief (from the AEDPA and its judicial affirmations) has sometimes led to federal appellate judges to instead publicly shame state prosecutors during oral arguments, which are streamed online.\nOn \"Last Week Tonight with John Oliver\" on March 6, 2022, John Oliver called for the abolition of AEDPA because of the increased difficulty in appealing convictions and noting cases of wrongful convictions. He cited in particular Melissa Lucio, who first won her federal habeas corpus appeal for a new trial, but the appeal itself was then reversed by the same court citing the AEDPA.\nNotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 1905, he completed his first degree in electrical engineering. He published his first paper, a mathematically elegant solution of a problem involving eddy currents, in 1907. At Aachen, he studied under the theoretical physicist Arnold Sommerfeld, who later claimed that his most important discovery was Peter Debye.\nIn 1906, Sommerfeld received an appointment at Munich, Bavaria, and took Debye with him as his assistant. Debye got his Ph.D. with a dissertation on radiation pressure in 1908. In 1910, he derived the Planck radiation formula using a method which Max Planck agreed was simpler than his own.\nIn 1911, when Albert Einstein took an appointment as a professor at Prague, Bohemia, Debye took his old professorship at the University of Zurich, Switzerland. This was followed by moves to Utrecht in 1912, to G\u00f6ttingen in 1913, to ETH Zurich in 1920, to University of Leipzig in 1927, and in 1934 to Berlin, where, succeeding Einstein, he became director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics (now named the Max-Planck-Institut) whose facilities were built only during Debye's era. He was awarded the Lorentz Medal in 1935. From 1937 to 1939 he was the president of the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.\nIn May 1914 he became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences and in December of the same year he became foreign member.\nFamily and personal life.\nPeter Debye was described as a martinet when it came to scientific principles, yet he was always approachable and made time for his students. His personal philosophy emphasized a fulfillment of purpose and enjoyment in one's work. Debye was an avid trout fisherman and gardener, collector of cacti, and was \"always known to enjoy a nice cigar\".\nWhile in Berlin as an assistant to Arnold Sommerfeld, Debye became acquainted with Mathilde Alberer. Mathilde was the daughter of the proprietor of the boarding house in which Debye was staying. Mathilde would soon change her citizenship and in 1913, Debye married Mathilde Alberer. Debye would enjoy working in his rose garden with Mathilde Alberer late into his years. They had a son, Peter P. Debye (1916\u20132012), and a daughter, Mathilde Maria (1921\u20131991). Peter became a physicist and collaborated with Debye in some of his research, and had a son who was also a chemist.\nDebye was a faithful Catholic who insisted his family go to church.\nScientific contributions.\nHis first major scientific contribution was the application of the concept of dipole moment to the charge distribution in asymmetric molecules in 1912, developing equations relating dipole moments to temperature and dielectric constant. In consequence, the units of molecular dipole moments are termed \"debyes\" in his honor. Also in 1912, he extended Albert Einstein's theory of specific heat to lower temperatures by including contributions from low-frequency phonons. See Debye model.\nIn 1913, he extended Niels Bohr's theory of atomic structure, introducing elliptical orbits, a concept also introduced by Arnold Sommerfeld. In 1914\u20131915, Debye calculated the effect of temperature on X-ray diffraction patterns of crystalline solids with Paul Scherrer (the \"Debye\u2013Waller factor\").\nIn 1923, together with his assistant Erich H\u00fcckel, he developed an improvement of Svante Arrhenius' theory of electrical conductivity in electrolyte solutions. Although an improvement was made to the Debye\u2013H\u00fcckel equation in 1926 by Lars Onsager, the theory is still regarded as a major forward step in our understanding of electrolytic solutions. Also in 1923, Debye developed a theory to explain the Compton effect, the shifting of the frequency of X-rays when they interact with electrons.\nLater work.\nFrom 1934 to 1939 Debye was director of the physics section of the prestigious Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin. From 1936 onwards he was also professor of Theoretical Physics at the Frederick William University of Berlin. These positions were held during the Nazi regime in Germany and, from 1938 onward, Austria.\nIn 1939 Debye traveled to the United States to deliver the Baker Lectures at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. After leaving Germany in early 1940, Debye became a professor at Cornell, chaired the chemistry department for 10 years, and became a member of Alpha Chi Sigma. In 1946 he became an American citizen. Unlike the European phase of his life, where he moved from city to city every few years, in the United States Debye remained at Cornell for the remainder of his career. He retired in 1952, but continued research until his death.\nMuch of Debye's work at Cornell concerned the use of light-scattering techniques (derived from his X-ray scattering work of years earlier) to determine the size and molecular weight of polymer molecules. This started as a result of his research during World War II on synthetic rubber, but was extended to proteins and other macromolecules.\nIn April 1966, Debye suffered a heart attack, and in November of that year a second one proved fatal. He is buried in the Pleasant Grove Cemetery (Ithaca, New York, US).\nWar activities and controversies.\n2006 controversy.\nIn January 2006, a book (in Dutch) appeared in The Netherlands, written by Sybe Rispens, entitled \"Einstein in the Netherlands.\" One chapter of this book discusses the relationship between Albert Einstein and Debye. Rispens discovered documents that, as he believed, were new and proved that, during his directorship of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society, Debye was actively involved in cleansing German science institutions of Jewish and other \"non-Aryan elements\". Rispens records that on December 9, 1938, Debye wrote in his capacity as chairman of the \"Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft\" (DPG) to all the members of the DPG:\n\"In light of the current situation, membership by German Jews as stipulated by the Nuremberg laws, of the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft cannot be continued. According to the wishes of the board, I ask of all members to whom these definitions apply to report to me their resignation. Heil Hitler!\"\nMany biographies published before Rispens' work, state that Debye moved to the US because he refused to accept German citizenship forced on to him by the Nazis. He planned his departure from Germany during a visit with his mother in Maastricht in late 1939, boarded a ship in Genoa in January 1940 and arrived in New York in early February 1940. He immediately sought a permanent position in the US and accepted such an offer from Cornell in June 1940. That month, he crossed the US border into Canada and returned within days on an immigration visa. He was able to get his wife out of Germany and to the US by December 1940. Although his son already was in the US before he departed, Peter Debye's 19-year-old daughter and his sister-in-law did not leave. They lived in his official residence in Berlin and were supported by Debye's official Berlin wages (he carefully maintained an official leave of absence for this purpose).\nFurther, Rispens alleges that Albert Einstein in the first half of 1940 tried to prevent Debye from being appointed in the United States at Cornell. Einstein allegedly wrote to his American colleagues: \"I know from a reliable source that Peter Debye is still in close contact with the German (Nazi) leaders\" and, according to Rispens, called upon his colleagues to do \"what they consider their duty as American citizens\". To support this, Rispens refers to a well-known letter from Debye to Einstein and Einstein's response to it. Van Ginkel investigated 1940 FBI reports on this matter and traced the \"reliable source\" to a single letter directed to Einstein and written by someone whose name is lost. This person was not known personally to Einstein and, according to Einstein, probably did not know Debye personally either. Moreover, this accusatory letter did not reach Einstein directly but was intercepted by British censors who showed it to Einstein. Einstein sent the British agent with the letter to Cornell, and the Cornell authorities told Debye about the affair. Thereupon Debye wrote his well-known 1940 letter to Einstein to which Einstein answered. The latter two letters can be found in the published Einstein correspondence.\nRispens alleges that Debye sent a telegram to Berlin on 23 June 1941 informing his previous employers that he was able and willing to resume his responsibilities at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institut, presumably to maintain his leave of absence and keep the Berlin house and wages available for his daughter. A copy of this telegram has not been recovered thus far. In summer 1941, Debye filed his intent to become a US citizen and was quickly recruited in the US to participate in Allied war research.\nIt has been well documented in many biographies, and also in Rispens' book, that Debye and Dutch colleagues helped his Jewish colleague Lise Meitner in 1938\u20131939 (at great risk to himself and his family) cross the Dutch-German border to escape Nazi persecution and eventually obtain a position in Sweden.\nPredating Rispens' work, and in contrast to it, an article by Rechenberg appeared 18 years earlier concerning Debye's letter. The article describes Debye's missive in more detail and presents a very favorable picture of Debye in his efforts to resist Nazi activists. Moreover, this article points out that Max von Laue, well known for his anti-Nazi views, gave his approval to the letter from the DPG chairman.\nInternational response.\nDebye's son, Peter P. Debye, interviewed in 2006 at age 89 recollects that his father was completely apolitical and that in the privacy of their home politics were never discussed. According to his son, Debye just wanted to do his job at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute and as long as the Nazis did not bother him was able to do so. He recalls that his mother urged him (the son) to stay in the US in the event of war. Debye's son had come to the US on a planned 2-month vacation during the summer of 1939 and never returned to Germany because war broke out.\nIn an opinion article published on the Debye Institute website, Dr. Gijs van Ginkel, until April 2007 Senior Managing Director of the VM Debye Instituut in Utrecht deplored the decision to rename the institute. In his article he cites scholars who point out that the DPG was able to retain their threatened staff as long as could be expected under increasing pressure from the Nazis. He also puts forward the important argument that when Debye in 1950 received the Max Planck medal of the DPG, nobody objected, not even the known opponent of the national socialists Max von Laue, who would have been in a position to object. Also Einstein, with his enormous prestige, was still alive, as were other Jewish scientists such as Lise Meitner and James Franck who both knew Debye intimately. None of them protested against Debye's receiving the highest German scientific distinction. In fact, Albert Einstein, after many years of not participating in the voting for the Max Planck Medal nominees, joined the process again to vote for Debye.\nMaastricht University also announced that it was reconsidering its position on the \"Peter Debye Prijs voor natuurwetenschappelijk onderzoek\" (Peter Debye Prize for scientific research).\nIn a reply on the DPG website, Dieter Hoffmann and Mark Walker also conclude that Debye was not a Nazi activist. They remark that Max von Laue also was required and obliged (as a civil servant) to sign letters with \"Heil Hitler\". They also state that the DPG was one of the last scientific societies to purge the Jewish members and only very reluctantly. They quote the response of the \"Reich University Teachers League\" (a National Socialist organization) to the Debye letter:\n\"Obviously the German Physical Society is still very backward and still clings tightly to their dear Jews. It is in fact remarkable that only \"because of circumstances beyond our control\" the membership of Jews can no longer be maintained\"\nIn May 2006, the Dutch Nobel Prize winner Martinus Veltman who had written the foreword to the Rispen book, renounced the book's description of Peter Debye, withdrew his foreword, and asked the Board of Directors of Utrecht University to rescind their decision to rename the Debye Institute.\nVarious historical investigations, both in The Netherlands and in the US, have been carried out subsequent to the actions of the University of Maastricht. The earliest of these investigations, carried out by the Cornell University's department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology released a report on 31 May 2006, which states that:\n\"Based on the information to-date, we have not found evidence supporting the accusations that Debye was a Nazi sympathizer or collaborator or that he held anti-Semitic views. It is important that this be stated clearly since these are the most serious allegations.\"\nIt goes on to declare:\n\"Thus, based on the information, evidence and historical record known to date, we believe that any action that dissociates Debye's name from the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Cornell is unwarranted.\"\nIn June 2006, it was reported that the scientific director of the (formerly) Debye Institute had been reprimanded by the board of directors of the University of Utrecht for a new publication on Debye's war years on the grounds that it was too personally biased with respect to the Institute's naming dispute. According to the board, the book should have been published not as a Debye Institute publication, but as a personal one. The book was banned by the University of Utrecht and both Directors of the (former) Debye Institute were forbidden to have any further contact with the press. A dozen professors of the Physics Faculty, amongst whom Cees Andriesse, openly protested against the interventions of the Board and the censorship of their protest by the university.\nIn May 2007, the universities of Utrecht and Maastricht announced that a new committee headed by Jan Terlouw would advise them regarding the name change. Also, in the beginning of 2007 an official report was announced, to be published by the NIOD and authorized by the Dutch Education Ministry (then scheduled for fall 2007).\n2007 NIOD report.\nThe report describes Rispens' presentation of Debye, as an opportunist who had no objection to the Nazis, as a caricature.\n\"[I]t can be stated that Debye was rightly called an opportunist after his arrival in the United States. We have seen that he showed himself to be loyal to the dominant political system, first in the Third Reich and then in the United States, while at the same time keeping the back door open: in the Third Reich by retaining his Dutch nationality, in the United States by attempting to secretly maintain some contacts with Nazi Germany via the Foreign Office.\"\nIt concludes that Debye's actions in 1933\u201345 were based on the nineteenth-century positivist view of science which saw research in physics as generating blessings for humankind. The report states that, by his contemporaries, Debye was considered an opportunist by some and as a man of highest character by others. The report asserts that Debye was not coerced by the Nazis into writing the infamous DPG \"Heil Hitler\" letter and that he also did not follow the lead of other societies in doing so but, rather, other societies followed his lead. The NIOD report also concludes that Debye felt obliged to send the letter and that it was, for him, simply a confirmation of an existing situation. The report argues that Debye, in the Third Reich, developed a survival method of ambiguity which allowed him to pursue his scientific career despite the political turmoil. Crucial to this survival method was the need to keep ready an escape hatch, for example in his secret dealings with the Nazis in 1941, if needed.\nYet, the report also states that the picture of Debye should not be oversimplified as Debye's actions were also motivated by his loyalty to his daughter, who had remained in Berlin. In general, Debye developed a survival method of ambiguity, that \"could pull the wool over people's eyes\".\n2008 Terlouw report.\nIn January 2008 the Terlouw Commission advised \"the Boards of Utrecht and Maastricht Universities to continue to use Peter Debye\u2019s name for the chemistry and physics institute in Utrecht, and to continue awarding the science prize in Maastricht\". The Commission concluded that Debye was not a party member, was not an anti-semite, did not further Nazi propaganda, did not cooperate with the Nazi war machine, was not a collaborator, and yet also was not a resistance hero. He was a rather pragmatic, flexible, and brilliant scientist, idealistic with respect to the pursuit of science, but only superficially oriented in politics. With respect to sending out the DPG letter, the Commission concluded that Debye found the situation inescapable. The Commission pointed out that the Royal Dutch Academy of Sciences also took away Albert Einstein's honorary membership, emphasizing the circumstances in which these decisions had been taken. The Commission stated that now, seventy years later, no judgment can be made concerning the decision of Debye to sign this letter in the exceptionally difficult circumstances in which he then found himself. Nevertheless, the Commission describes the DPG letter as an extraordinarily unpleasant fact, forming a dark page in his life history. Finally, the Commission concluded that based on the NIOD report \"since no bad faith on Debye\u2019s part has been demonstrated, his good faith must be assumed\" and recommended that the University of Utrecht retain the name of the Debye Institute of NanoMaterials Science and that the University of Maastricht continue to associate itself with the Peter Debye Prize. Utrecht University accepted the recommendation, Maastricht University did not. But in February 2008, the Hustinx Foundation (Maastricht), originator and sponsor of the Peter Debye Prize, announced that it will continue to have the prize awarded. The City of Maastricht, Debye's birthplace, declared that it sees no reason to change the names of Debye Street and Debye Square.\nDebye the spy.\nIn a 2010 publication Jurrie Reiding asserts that Debye may have been an MI6 spy. Reiding discovered that Debye was befriended by the well-documented spy Paul Rosbaud. They first met around 1930 when they were both working as editors for two scientific journals. They collaborated in the escape of Lise Meitner in 1938. According to Reiding, Debye was well connected in German scientific and industrial circles and could have provided MI6 with valuable information. For example, as board member of the German Academy for Aviation Research he was acquainted with Hermann G\u00f6ring. Reiding also offers an explanation for Debye's hasty departure on 16 January 1940 for the United States: the date coincided with the planned (but later delayed) German invasion of the Netherlands a day later, information possibly provided to him by Rosbaud.\nThis hypothesis is contested by Philip Ball, as he notes that friendship with Rosbaud is no gauge of Debye's political stance. Rosbaud was well-connected with many people and Debye, while he was a friend of Rosbaud's, seems to have also felt regard for geologist Friedrich Drescher-Kaden, an ardent Nazi.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "37068", "revid": "50958076", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37068", "title": "The War Game", "text": "1965 pseudo-documentary TV film by Peter Watkins\nThe War Game is a 1965 British pseudo-documentary film that depicts a nuclear war and its aftermath. Written, directed and produced by Peter Watkins for the BBC, it caused dismay within the BBC and within government and was withdrawn before the provisional screening date of 6 October 1965. The corporation said that \"the effect of the film has been judged by the BBC to be too horrifying for the medium of broadcasting. It will, however, be shown to invited audiences...\"\nThe film premiered at the National Film Theatre in London, on 13 April 1966, where it ran until 3 May. It was then shown abroad at several film festivals, including Venice, where it won the Special Prize. It won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 1967.\nThe film was eventually televised in Great Britain on 31 July 1985, during the week before the fortieth anniversary of the Hiroshima bombing, the day before a repeat screening of \"Threads\".\nSynopsis.\nThe film begins by describing Britain's nuclear deterrence policy of threatening would-be aggressors with devastation from the Royal Air Force's nuclear-armed V bombers. Due to the number of V bomber bases (particularly in a crisis situation that would see them dispersed throughout Britain), as well as major civilian targets in cities, Britain is described as having more potential nuclear weapon targets per acre than any other country.\nOn 15 September, American forces in South Vietnam are authorised to use tactical nuclear weapons in response to an ongoing Chinese invasion. The Soviet Union and East Germany threaten to invade West Berlin if America does not change course. The next day, the British government declares a state of emergency and transfers responsibility for Britain's day-to-day running to a body of regional commissioners. The first task of newly established emergency committees is the mass evacuation of children, mothers, and the infirm to various safe areas including Kent. Under threat of imprisonment, homeowners accommodate the evacuees, while unoccupied properties are requisitioned by the government. Rationing is implemented, booklets on how to prepare for nuclear attack are distributed, and emergency sirens are tested, with these being estimated to provide around three minutes' warning until impact, or under thirty seconds in the case of submarine attack. There are no government-built shelters and efforts to build private ones are soon frustrated by a shortage of construction supplies.\nOn 18 September the Soviets and East Germans invade West Berlin as previously threatened. NATO launches a counterattack, which is quickly overrun, resulting in the use of American tactical nuclear weapons. The Soviets immediately launch their own nuclear weapons at strategic targets, as their above-ground liquid-fuelled missiles are highly vulnerable to a NATO first strike.\nIn Kent a one-megaton warhead that overshoots RAF Manston explodes in an air burst six miles from Canterbury, causing the city to be struck by the intense heat given off by the blast. At one house a defence worker and a boy in the yard are struck by the heat wave, causing their eyeballs to melt. Furniture inside the house catches fire, causing those inside to panic as they attempt to put the flames out. Twelve seconds later the building is destroyed by the incoming shockwave. At another house a boy suffers flash blindness as a consequence of looking directly at an explosion 27 miles away; his father carries him inside and hides with the rest of his family under a table as the house is shaken by the distant shockwaves of successive explosions. In Rochester, an airburst causes a firestorm, which sets the town ablaze. Meanwhile British V bombers enter Soviet airspace to inflict similar devastation.\nThe attack overwhelms Kent's emergency services, with each surviving doctor being faced with at least 350 casualties. The worst-affected victims are left to die alone or shot by police as a form of mercy killing. Cases of PTSD occur among the survivors of the attacks. Bodies are disposed of by being burned; to prevent relatives from interfering, destroyed areas are sealed off, and police are routinely armed. Radiation sickness is rampant and essential supplies and utilities are non-existent or severely limited.\nThe majority of Britain's remaining food supplies are reserved for those maintaining law and order, causing riots to break out over access to resources. The riots soon turn into armed skirmishes between the authorities and desperate civilians; the latter are shown seizing a truck carrying a shipment of weapons and a food warehouse. Elsewhere individuals convicted of causing civil disturbance or obstructing government officers are executed by police firing squads, with the father of the blinded boy from earlier in the film among those shot. Due to food shortages, scurvy emerges as a consequence of a lack of easily available vitamin C.\nOn Christmas Day in a Dover refugee facility children orphaned in the attack are asked what they want to be when they grow up; they either \"don't want to be nothing\" or simply remain silent. Another child is described as having only seven bedridden years to live before dying from a chronic illness resembling leukaemia, and a pregnant woman who was exposed to radiation is unsure if she will suffer stillbirth. In closing, the real-world press is described as saying nothing about the dangers of nuclear weaponry. Over the closing credits, one can hear a damaged recording of the Christmas hymn \"Silent Night\" (Mohr and Gruber, 1818).\nStyle.\nThe story is told in the style of a news magazine programme. It wavers between a pseudo-documentary and a drama film, with characters acknowledging the presence of the camera crew in some segments and others (in particular the nuclear attack) filmed as if the camera was not present. The combination of elements also qualifies it as a mondo film. It features several different strands that alternate throughout, including a documentary-style chronology of the main events, featuring reportage-like images of the war, the nuclear strikes, and their effects on civilians; brief contemporary interviews, in which passers-by are interviewed about what turns out to be their general lack of knowledge of nuclear war issues; optimistic commentary from public figures that clashes with the other images in the film; and fictional interviews with key figures as the war unfolds.\nThe film has a voice-over narration that describes the events depicted as plausible occurrences during and after a nuclear war. The narrator seeks to convince the viewing audience that the civil defence policies of 1965 have not realistically prepared the public for such events, particularly suggesting that the policies neglected the possibility of panic buying that would occur for building materials to construct improvised fallout shelters.\nThe public are generally depicted as lacking all understanding of nuclear matters with the exception of a character with a double-barrelled shotgun who successfully implemented the contemporary civil defence advice and heavily sandbagged his home. The film does not focus on individual experiences but rather the collective British population, who rely on government preparations and are not fully convinced of the dangers of nuclear war until the final hours before the attack.\nThe film often invokes historical mass casualty situations in relation to its portrayal of a post-attack situation; for example, the collection of wedding rings from dead bodies to aid their later identification is explicitly linked to a similar practice seen after the 1945 bombing of Dresden, while the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are regularly cited when discussing the physical and mental decline of survivors.\nOf his intent, Watkins said:\n ... Interwoven among scenes of \"reality\" were stylized interviews with a series of \"establishment figures\" \u2013 an Anglican Bishop, a nuclear strategist, etc. The outrageous statements by some of these people (including the Bishop) \u2013 in favour of nuclear weapons, even nuclear war \u2013 were actually based on genuine quotations. Other interviews with a doctor, a psychiatrist, etc. were more sober, and gave details of the effects of nuclear weapons on the human body and mind. In this film I was interested in breaking the illusion of media-produced \"reality\". My question was \u2013 \"Where is 'reality'? ... in the madness of statements by these artificially-lit establishment figures quoting the official doctrine of the day, or in the madness of the staged and fictional scenes from the rest of my film, which presented the consequences of their utterances?\nTo this end, the docudrama employs juxtaposition by, for example, quickly cutting from the scenes of horror after an immediate escalation from military to city nuclear attacks to a snippet of a recording of a calm lecture by a person resembling Herman Kahn, a renowned RAND strategist, hypothesising that a third world war would not necessarily escalate to a stage involving \"the ultimate destruction of cities\" and, indeed, that stopping the conflict before then would give the belligerents around ten years of post-war recovery in which to prepare for the next five world wars. The effect of this juxtaposition is to make the speaker appear out of touch with the \"reality\" of rapid escalation and of the likelihood of cities being utterly destroyed as depicted immediately before his contribution. Similarly, the film briefly cuts away from the destruction inflicted on Canterbury to show a textual statement by two bishops from the Vatican's ecumenical council who argue that the faithful \"should learn to live with, though need not love, the nuclear bomb, provided that it is 'clean' and of a good family\", before then cutting back to Canterbury's fate, while a spoken statement by an Anglican bishop about his continued belief in \"a system of necessary law and order [and] in the war of the just\" is immediately followed by a scene of a family burning to death in their car during the Rochester firestorm.\nProduction.\nThe film was shot in the Kent towns of Tonbridge, Gravesend, Chatham and Dover. The cast was almost entirely made up of amateur and non-actors, as was Watkins' preference, casting having taken place via a series of public meetings several months earlier; more than 350 actors would ultimately take part in the production. Much of the filming of the post-strike devastation was shot at the Grand Shaft Barracks, Dover. The narration was provided by Peter Graham, with Michael Aspel reading the quotations from source material.\nRelease.\nAfter its cinema release in the United Kingdom and an airing at the New York Film Festival, Path\u00e9 Contemporary Films released \"The War Game\" in US cinemas in 1967. It subsequently did well as a non-theatrical release.\n\"The War Game\" itself finally saw television broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC2 on 31 July 1985, as part of a special season of programming entitled \"After the Bomb\" (which had been Watkins' original working title for \"The War Game\"). \"After the Bomb\" commemorated the 40th anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The broadcast was preceded by an introduction from Ludovic Kennedy.\nOn 27 August 1968 nearly 250 people at a peace rally in the Edwin Lewis Quadrangle in Philadelphia attended a screening of the film sponsored by the Pennsylvania Coalition. Like the United Kingdom, the film was also banned from National Educational Television in the United States owing to its theme.\nReception and legacy.\nThe film holds a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 93% based on 14 reviews, with an average score of 8.46/10.\nAfter watching the film, Paul McCartney of the Beatles was quoted as saying \"There are hundreds of films about which people say to you: 'You've GOT to see it!' Often, it's just a passing comment. But if anyone ever says this to you about \"The War Game\", take them seriously. This picture is not just important. It's terrifying and urgent\".\nRoger Ebert gave the film a perfect score, calling it \"[o]ne of the most skillful documentary films ever made.\" He praised the \"remarkable authenticity\" of the firestorm sequence and describes its portrayal of bombing's aftermath as \"certainly the most horrifying ever put on film (although, to be sure, greater suffering has taken place in real life, and is taking place today).\" \"They should string up bedsheets between the trees and show \"The War Game\" in every public park\" he concludes, \"It should be shown on television, perhaps right after one of those half-witted war series in which none of the stars ever gets killed.\" David Cornelius of \"DVD Talk\" called it \"one of the most disturbing, overwhelming, and downright important films ever produced.\" He writes that the film finds Watkins \"at his very best, angry and provocative and desperate to tell the truth, yet not once dipping below anything but sheer greatness from a filmmaking perspective [...] an unquestionable masterpiece of raw journalism, political commentary, and unrestrained terror.\"\nAccolades.\nThe film won the 1967 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.\nIn a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, voted for by industry professionals, \"The War Game\" was placed 27th. \"The War Game\" was also voted 74th in Channel Four's 100 Greatest Scary Moments.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "37071", "revid": "49292273", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37071", "title": "Civil and political rights", "text": "Rights preventing the infringement of personal freedom by other social actors\nCivil and political rights are a class of rights that protect individuals' freedom from infringement by governments, social organizations, and private individuals. They ensure one's entitlement to participate in the civil and political life of society and the state.\nCivil rights generally include ensuring peoples' physical and mental integrity, life, and safety, protection from discrimination, the right to privacy, the freedom of thought, speech, religion, press, assembly, and movement.\nPolitical rights include natural justice (procedural fairness) in law, such as the rights of the accused, including the right to a fair trial; due process; the right to seek redress or a legal remedy; and rights of participation in civil society and politics such as freedom of association, the right to assemble, the right to petition, the right of self-defense, and the right to vote. These rights also must follow the legal norm as in they must have the force of law and fit into the system of administrative justice. A key feature in modern society is that the more a state can guarantee political rights of citizens the better the states relations are with its citizens.\nCivil and political rights form the original and main part of international human rights. They comprise the first portion of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (with economic, social, and cultural rights comprising the second portion). The theory of three generations of human rights considers this group of rights to be \"first-generation rights\", and the theory of negative and positive rights considers them to be generally negative rights.\nHistory.\nThe phrase \"civil rights\" is a translation of Latin \"jus civis\" (right of the citizen). Roman citizens could be either free (\"libertas\") or servile (\"servitus\"), but they all had rights in law. After the Edict of Milan in 313, these rights included the freedom of religion; however, in 380, the Edict of Thessalonica required all subjects of the Roman Empire to profess Nicene Christianity. Roman legal doctrine was lost during the Middle Ages, but claims of universal rights could still be made based on Christian doctrine. According to the leaders of Kett's Rebellion (1549), \"all bond men may be made free, for God made all free with his precious blood-shedding.\"\nIn the 17th century, English common law judge Sir Edward Coke revived the idea of rights based on citizenship by arguing that Englishmen had historically enjoyed such rights. The Parliament of England adopted the English Bill of Rights in 1689. It was one of the influences drawn on by George Mason and James Madison when drafting the Virginia Declaration of Rights in 1776. The Virginia declaration heavily influenced the U.S. Bill of Rights (1789).\nThe removal by legislation of a civil right constitutes a \"civil disability\". In early 19th century Britain, the phrase \"civil rights\" most commonly referred to the issue of such legal discrimination against Catholics. In the House of Commons, support for civil rights was divided, with many politicians agreeing with the existing civil disabilities of Catholics. The Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 restored their civil rights.\nIn the United States, the term civil rights has been associated with the civil rights movement (1954\u20131968), which fought against racism. The movement also fought segregation and Jim Crow laws and this fight took place in the streets, in public places, in government, and in the courts including the Supreme Court. The civil rights movement was also not the only movement fighting for civil rights as The Black Panthers were also a group focused on fighting racism and Jim Crow.\nOther things that civil rights have been associated with are not just race but also rights of Transgender and other LGBTQ individuals. These have been fights over sexuality instead of race and focused around whether these individuals may access certain spaces like bathrooms according to their sexual identity or biological sex. Gavin Grimm's fight in Virginia over whether he could use the bathroom of his choice is a well known case in these civil right fights.\nAnother issue in civil rights has been the issue with police brutality in certain communities especially minority communities. This has been seen as another way for minority groups to be oppressed and their rights infringed upon. Outrage has also been a massive result of incidents caught on tape of police abusing and in some cases causing the deaths of people from minority groups such as African Americans. That is why to address the issue has been accountability to police engaging in such conduct as a way to deter other officers from committing similar actions.\nProtection of rights.\nT. H. Marshall notes that civil rights were among the first to be recognized and codified, followed later by political rights and still later by social rights. In many countries, they are constitutional rights and are included in a bill of rights or similar document. They are also defined in international human rights instruments, such as the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\nCivil and political rights need not be codified to be protected. However, most democracies worldwide do have formal written guarantees of civil and political rights. Civil rights are considered to be natural rights. Thomas Jefferson wrote in his \"A Summary View of the Rights of British America\" that \"a free people [claim] their rights as derived from the laws of nature, and not as the gift of their chief magistrate.\"\nThe question of to whom civil and political rights apply is a subject of controversy. Although in many countries citizens are considered to have greater protections against infringement of rights than non-citizens, civil and political rights are generally considered to be universal rights that apply to all persons. One thing to mention is that if individuals have fewer political rights than are they more likely to commit political violence such as in countries where individual rights are highly restricted. That is why it is important for countries to protect the political rights of all citizens including minority groups. This extends to racial, ethnic, tribal, and religious groups. By granting them the same rights it helps reduce the risk of political violence breaking out.\nAccording to political scientist Salvador Santino F. Regilme Jr., analyzing the causes of and lack of protection from human rights abuses in the Global South should be focusing on the interactions of domestic and international factors\u2014an important perspective that has usually been systematically neglected in the social science literature.\nOther rights.\nCustom also plays a role. Implied or unenumerated rights are rights that courts may find to exist even though not expressly guaranteed by written law or custom; one example is the right to privacy in the United States, and the Ninth Amendment explicitly shows that other rights are also protected.\nThe United States Declaration of Independence states that people have unalienable rights including \"Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness\". It is considered by some that the sole purpose of government is the protection of life, liberty, and property.\nSome thinkers have argued that the concepts of self-ownership and cognitive liberty affirm rights to choose the food one eats, the medicine one takes, and the habit one indulges.\nSocial movements for civil rights.\nCivil rights guarantee equal protection under the law. When civil and political rights are not guaranteed to all as part of equal protection of laws, or when such guarantees exist on paper but are not respected in practice, opposition, legal action and even social unrest may ensue.\nCivil rights movements in the United States gathered steam by 1848 with such documents as the Declaration of Sentiment. Consciously modeled after the Declaration of Independence, the Declaration of Rights and Sentiments became the founding document of the American women's movement, and it was adopted at the Seneca Falls Convention, July 19 and 20, 1848.\nWorldwide, several political movements for equality before the law occurred between approximately 1950 and 1980. These movements had a legal and constitutional aspect, and resulted in much law-making at both national and international levels. They also had an activist side, particularly in situations where violations of rights were widespread. Movements with the proclaimed aim of securing observance of civil and political rights included:\nMost civil rights movements relied on the technique of civil resistance, using nonviolent methods to achieve their aims. In some countries, struggles for civil rights were accompanied, or followed, by civil unrest and even armed rebellion. While civil rights movements over the last sixty years have resulted in an extension of civil and political rights, the process was long and tenuous in many countries, and many of these movements did not achieve or fully achieve their objectives.\nProblems and analysis.\nQuestions about civil and political rights have frequently emerged. For example, to what extent should the government intervene to protect individuals from infringement on their rights by other individuals, or from corporations\u2014e.g., in what way should employment discrimination in the private sector be dealt with?\nPolitical theory deals with civil and political rights. Robert Nozick and John Rawls expressed competing visions in Nozick's \"Anarchy, State, and Utopia\" and Rawls' \"A Theory of Justice\". Other influential authors in the area include Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld, and Jean Edward Smith.\nFirst-generation rights.\nFirst-generation rights, often called \"blue\" rights, deal essentially with liberty and participation in political life. They are fundamentally civil and political in nature, as well as strongly individualistic: They serve negatively to protect the individual from excesses of the state. First-generation rights include, among other things, freedom of speech, the right to a fair trial, (in some countries) the right to keep and bear arms, freedom of religion, freedom from discrimination, and voting rights. They were pioneered in the seventeenth and eighteenth-century during the Age of Enlightenment. Political theories associated with the English, American, and French revolutions were codified in the English Bill of Rights in 1689 (a restatement of Rights of Englishmen, some dating back to Magna Carta in 1215) and more fully in the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen in 1789 and the United States Bill of Rights in 1791.\nThey were enshrined at the global level and given status in international law first by Articles 3 to 21 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and later in the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In Europe, they were enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights in 1953.\nCivil and political rights organizations.\nThere are current organizations that exist to protect people's civil and political rights in case they are infringed upon. The ACLU, founded in 1920, is a well-known non-profit organization that helps to preserve freedom of speech and works to change policy. Another organization is the NAACP, founded in 1909, which focuses on protecting the civil rights of minorities. The NRA is a civil rights group founded in 1871 that primarily focuses on protecting the right to bear arms. These organizations serve a variety of causes, one being the AFL\u2013CIO, which is America's union that represent the working-class people nationwide.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

If the loaded chamber aligns with the barrel after cocking (with a single-action revolver), or is in the position which will be rotated to the barrel upon pulling the trigger (double-action), the weapon fires.\nEtymology.\nThe term \"Russian roulette\" was possibly first used in a 1937 short story of the same name by Georges Surdez, published in the January 30, 1937, edition of \"Collier's\" magazine:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;'Did you ever hear of Russian Roulette?' When I said I had not, he told me all about it. When he was with the Russian army in Rumania, around 1917, and things were cracking up, so that their officers felt that they were not only losing prestige, money, family, and country, but were being also dishonored before their colleagues of the Allied armies, some officer would suddenly pull out his revolver, anywhere, at the table, in a caf\u00e9, at a gathering of friends, remove a cartridge from the cylinder, spin the cylinder, snap it back in place, put it to his head and pull the trigger. There were five chances to one that the hammer would set off a live cartridge and blow his brains all over the place.\nReferences to the term in the context of the \"Collier's\" story appeared in some newspapers during 1937. The first independent appearances of the term in newspapers began in 1938 with the reports of young men being killed while playing it. The earliest instance appears to have been the death of a 21-year-old former journalism student in Austin, Texas, appearing in \"The Austin Statesman\" and some other Texas newspapers on January 8, 1938. At least four other deaths were attributed to Russian roulette during the year: a 34-year-old policeman in Peoria, Illinois, a 20-year-old in Houston, an 18-year-old in Saratoga Springs, New York, and a 16-year-old in Los Angeles.\nThe term has become a metaphor for taking foolhardy risks, and its usage steadily increased in reportage of diplomacy, politics, economics, medicine, and sports.\nOrigin.\nAn early example of Russian roulette can be found in the short story \"The Fatalist\" within the 1840 novel \"A Hero of Our Time\" written by Russian poet and writer Mikhail Lermontov. In the story, which is set in a Cossack village, the protagonist, Grigory Alexandrovich Pechorin, claims that there is no predestination and proposes a bet in order to prove it, laying about fifty gold pieces onto a table. A lieutenant of the dragoons of the Tsar, Vuli\u010d, a man of Serbian origins with a passion for gambling, accepts the challenge and randomly takes one of a number of pistols of various calibres from its nail, cocks it and pours gunpowder onto the pan. Nobody knows if the pistol is loaded or not. \"Gentlemen! Who will pay 20 gold pieces for me?\", Vuli\u010d asks, putting the muzzle of the pistol to his forehead. He then asks Grigory to throw a playing card in the air, and when the card lands, he pulls the trigger. The weapon fails to fire, but when Vuli\u010d cocks the pistol again and aims it at a service cap hanging over the window, a shot rings out and smoke fills the room.\nBooks and films.\n\"The Deer Hunter\" is a 1978 Vietnam War drama film about three Slavic-American steelworkers that are imprisoned by the Viet Cong, and are forced to participate in Russian roulette along with captured South Vietnamese soldiers, while the jailers bet on who will survive. Several teen deaths following the movie's release caused both police and the media to accuse the film of inspiring the youths.\n\"13 Tzameti\" is a 2005 dark psychological thriller by Georgian Babluani. Thirteen men undergo series of Russian roulette, arranging into a circle and pointing at the man in front of them (American remake in 2010).

{"id": "37073", "revid": "28481209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37073", "title": "Civil disobedience", "text": "Nonviolent disobedience of the law\nCivil disobedience is the active and professed refusal of a citizen to obey certain laws, demands, orders, or commands of a government (or any other authority). By some definitions, civil disobedience has to be nonviolent to be called \"civil\". Hence, civil disobedience is sometimes equated with peaceful protests or nonviolent resistance. Henry David Thoreau's essay \"Resistance to Civil Government\", first published in 1849 and then published posthumously in 1866 as \"Civil Disobedience\", popularized the term in the US, although the concept itself was practiced long before this work. \nVarious forms of civil disobedience have been used by prominent activists, such as American women's suffrage leader Susan B. Anthony in the late 19th century, Egyptian nationalist Saad Zaghloul during the 1910s, and Indian nationalist Mahatma Gandhi in 1920s British India as part of his leadership of the Indian independence movement. Martin Luther King Jr.'s and James Bevel's peaceful nonviolent protests during the civil rights movement in the 1960s United States sometimes contained important aspects of civil disobedience. Although civil disobedience is rarely justifiable in court, King regarded civil disobedience to be a display and practice of reverence for law: \"Any man who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust and willingly accepts the penalty by staying in jail to arouse the conscience of the community on the injustice of the law is at that moment expressing the very highest respect for the law.\"\nHistory.\nAn early depiction of civil disobedience is in Sophocles' play \"Antigone\", in which Antigone, one of the daughters of former King of Thebes, Oedipus, defies Creon, the current King of Thebes, who is trying to stop her from giving her brother Polynices a proper burial. She gives a stirring speech in which she tells him that she must obey her conscience rather than human law. She is not at all afraid of the death he threatens her with (and eventually carries out), but she is afraid of how her conscience will smite her if she does not do this.\nConrad Grebel and Anabaptists advocated civil disobedience to oppression. \u00c9tienne de La Bo\u00e9tie's thought developed in his work \"Discours de la servitude volontaire ou le Contr'un\" (1552) was also taken up by many movements of civil disobedience, which drew from the concept of rebellion to voluntary servitude the foundation of its instrument of struggle. \u00c9tienne de La Bo\u00e9tie was one of the first to theorize and propose the strategy of non-cooperation, and thus a form of nonviolent disobedience, as a really effective weapon.\nIn the lead-up to the Glorious Revolution in Britain\u2014when the 1689 Bill of Rights was documented, the last Catholic monarch was deposed, and male and female joint-co-monarchs elevated\u2014the English Midland Enlightenment developed a manner of voicing objection to a law viewed as illegitimate and then taking the consequences of the law. (For example, they might refuse to swear allegiance to the king, and, as a consequence, accept the prison sentence legally and normally meted out to people who refused to take this oath.) This was focused on the illegitimacy of laws claimed to be \"divine\" in origin, both the \"divine rights of kings\" and \"divine rights of man\", and the legitimacy of laws acknowledged to be made by human beings.\nFollowing the Peterloo massacre of 1819, the poet Percy Shelley wrote the political poem \"The Mask of Anarchy\" later that year, that begins with the images of what he thought to be the unjust forms of authority of his time\u2014and then imagines the stirrings of a new form of social action. According to Ashton Nichols, it is perhaps the first modern statement of the principle of nonviolent protest. A version was taken up by the author Henry David Thoreau in his essay \"Civil Disobedience\", and later by Gandhi in his doctrine of \"Satyagraha\". Gandhi's Satyagraha was partially influenced and inspired by Shelley's nonviolence in protest and political action. In particular, it is known that Gandhi often quoted Shelley's \"Mask of Anarchy\" to vast audiences during the campaign for a free India.\nThoreau's 1849 essay \"Civil Disobedience\", originally titled \"Resistance to Civil Government\", has had a wide influence on many later practitioners of civil disobedience. The driving idea behind the essay is that citizens are morally responsible for their support of aggressors, even when such support is required by law. In the essay, Thoreau explained his reasons for having refused to pay taxes as an act of protest against slavery and against the Mexican\u2013American War. He writes,\nIf I devote myself to other pursuits and contemplations, I must first see, at least, that I do not pursue them sitting upon another man's shoulders. I must get off him first, that he may pursue his contemplations too. See what gross inconsistency is tolerated. I have heard some of my townsmen say, \"I should like to have them order me out to help put down an insurrection of the slaves, or to march to Mexico;\u2014see if I would go;\" and yet these very men have each, directly by their allegiance, and so indirectly, at least, by their money, furnished a substitute.\nBy the 1850s, a range of minority groups in the United States: African Americans, Jews, Seventh Day Baptists, Catholics, anti-prohibitionists, racial egalitarians, and others\u2014employed civil disobedience to combat a range of legal measures and public practices that to them promoted ethnic, religious, and racial discrimination. Pro Public and typically peaceful resistance to political power remained an integral tactic in modern American minority rights politics.\nIn Ireland starting from 1879 the Irish \"Land War\" intensified when Irish nationalist leader Charles Stewart Parnell, in a speech in Ennis proposed that when dealing with tenants who take farms where another tenant was evicted, rather than resorting to violence, everyone in the locality should shun them. Following this Captain Charles Boycott, the land agent of an absentee landlord in County Mayo, Ireland, was subject to social ostracism organized by the Irish Land League in 1880. Boycott attempted to evict eleven tenants from his land. While Parnell's speech did not refer to land agents or landlords, the tactic was applied to Boycott when the alarm was raised about the evictions. Despite the short-term economic hardship to those undertaking this action, Boycott soon found himself isolated \u2013 his workers stopped work in the fields and stables, as well as in his house. Local businessmen stopped trading with him, and the local postman refused to deliver mail. The movement spread throughout Ireland and gave rise to the term to Boycott, and eventually led to legal reform and support for Irish independence.\nEgypt saw a massive implementation on a nation-wide movement starting 1914 and peaking in 1919 as the Egyptian Revolution of 1919. This was then adopted by other peoples who campaigned against European colonial rule from 1920 onwards. Zaghloul Pasha, considered the mastermind behind this massive civil disobedience, was a native middle-class, Azhar graduate, political activist, judge, parliamentary and ex-cabinet minister whose leadership brought Christian and Muslim communities together as well as women into the massive protests. Along with his companions of Wafd Party, who have achieved an independence of Egypt and a first constitution in 1923.\nCivil disobedience is one of the many ways people have revolted against what they deem to be unfair laws. It has been used in many nonviolent resistance movements in India (Mahatma Gandhi's campaigns for independence from the British Empire), in Czechoslovakia's Velvet Revolution, in early stages of the Bangladeshi independence movement against Pakistani colonialism and in East Germany to oust their Stalinist government. In South Africa during the leftist campaign against the far-right Apartheid regime, in the American civil rights movement against Jim Crow laws, in the Singing Revolution to bring independence to the Baltic countries from the Soviet Union, and more recently with the 2003 Rose Revolution in Georgia, the 2004 Orange Revolution and the 2013\u20132014 Euromaidan revolution in Ukraine, the 2016\u20132017 Candlelight Revolution in South Korea, and the 2020\u20132021 Belarusian protests, among many other various movements worldwide.\nEtymology.\nHenry David Thoreau's 1849 essay \"Resistance to Civil Government\" was eventually renamed \"Essay on Civil Disobedience\". After his landmark lectures were published in 1866, the term began to appear in numerous sermons and lectures relating to slavery and the war in Mexico. Thus, by the time Thoreau's lectures were first published under the title \"Civil Disobedience\", in 1866, four years after his death, the term had achieved fairly widespread usage.\nIt has been argued that the term \"civil disobedience\" has always suffered from ambiguity and in modern times, become utterly debased. Marshall Cohen notes, \"It has been used to describe everything from bringing a test-case in the federal courts to taking aim at a federal official. Indeed, for Vice President Spiro Agnew it has become a code-word describing the activities of muggers, arsonists, draft evaders, campaign hecklers, campus militants, anti-war demonstrators, juvenile delinquents and political assassins.\"\nLeGrande writes that\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;the formulation of a single all-encompassing definition of the term is extremely difficult, if not impossible. In reviewing the voluminous literature on the subject, the student of civil disobedience rapidly finds himself surrounded by a maze of semantical problems and grammatical niceties. Like Alice in Wonderland, he often finds that specific terminology has no more (or no less) meaning than the individual orator intends it to have.\nHe encourages a distinction between lawful protest demonstration, nonviolent civil disobedience, and violent civil disobedience.\nIn a letter to P.\u00a0K. Rao, dated 10 September 1935, Gandhi disputes that his idea of civil disobedience was derived from the writings of Thoreau:\nThe statement that I had derived my idea of Civil Disobedience from the writings of Thoreau is wrong. The resistance to authority in South Africa was well advanced before I got the essay\u00a0... When I saw the title of Thoreau's great essay, I began to use his phrase to explain our struggle to the English readers. But I found that even \"Civil Disobedience\" failed to convey the full meaning of the struggle. I therefore adopted the phrase \"Civil Resistance.\"\nTheories.\nIn seeking an active form of civil disobedience, one may choose to deliberately break certain laws, such as by forming a peaceful blockade or occupying a facility illegally, though sometimes violence has been known to occur. Often there is an expectation to be attacked or even beaten by the authorities. Protesters often undergo training in advance on how to react to arrest or to attack.\nCivil disobedience is usually defined as pertaining to a citizen's relation to the state and its laws, as distinguished from a constitutional impasse, in which two public agencies, especially two equally sovereign branches of government, conflict. For instance, if the head of government of a country were to refuse to enforce a decision of that country's highest court, it would not be civil disobedience, since the head of government would act in his or her capacity as public official rather than private citizen.\nThis definition is disputed by Thoreau's political philosophy on the conscience vs. the collective. The person is the final judge of right and wrong. More than this, since only people act, only a person can act unjustly. When the government knocks on the door, it is a person in the form of a postman or tax collector whose hand hits the wood. Before Thoreau's imprisonment, when a confused taxman had wondered aloud about how to handle his refusal to pay, Thoreau had advised, \"Resign\". If a man chose to be an agent of injustice, then Thoreau insisted on confronting him with the fact that he was making a choice. He admits that government may express the will of the majority but it may also express nothing more than the will of elite politicians. Even a good form of government is \"liable to be abused and perverted before the people can act through it\". If a government did express the voice of most people, this would not compel the obedience of those who disagree with what is said. The majority may be powerful but it is not necessarily right.\nIn his 1971 book, \"A Theory of Justice\", John Rawls described civil disobedience as \"a public, non-violent, conscientious yet political act contrary to law usually done with the aim of bringing about change in the law or policies of the government\".\nRonald Dworkin held that there are three types of civil disobedience:\nSome theories of civil disobedience hold that civil disobedience is only justified against governmental entities. Brownlee argues that disobedience in opposition to the decisions of non-governmental agencies such as trade unions, banks, and private universities can be justified if it reflects \"a larger challenge to the legal system that permits those decisions to be taken\". The same principle, she argues, applies to breaches of law in protest against international organizations and foreign governments.\nIt is usually recognized that lawbreaking, if it is not done publicly, at least must be publicly announced to constitute civil disobedience. But Stephen Eilmann argues that if it is necessary to disobey rules that conflict with morality, we might ask why disobedience should take the form of public civil disobedience rather than simply covert lawbreaking. If a lawyer wishes to help a client overcome legal obstacles to securing their natural rights, he might, for instance, find that assisting in fabricating evidence or committing perjury is more effective than open disobedience. This assumes that common morality does not have a prohibition on deceit in such situations. The Fully Informed Jury Association's publication \"A Primer for Prospective Jurors\" notes, \"Think of the dilemma faced by German citizens when Hitler's secret police demanded to know if they were hiding a Jew in their house.\" By this definition, civil disobedience could be traced back to the Book of Exodus, where Shiphrah and Puah refused a direct order of Pharaoh but misrepresented how they did it. (Exodus 1: 15\u201319)\nViolent vs. nonviolent.\nThere have been debates as to whether civil disobedience must necessarily be non-violent. \"Black's Law Dictionary\" includes nonviolence in its definition of civil disobedience. Christian Bay's encyclopedia article states that civil disobedience requires \"carefully chosen and legitimate means\", but holds that they do not have to be non-violent. It has been argued that, while both civil disobedience and civil rebellion are justified by appeal to constitutional defects, rebellion is much more destructive; therefore, the defects justifying rebellion must be much more serious than those justifying disobedience, and if one cannot justify civil rebellion, then one cannot justify a civil disobedient's use of force and violence and refusal to submit to arrest. Civil disobedients' refraining from violence is also said to help preserve society's tolerance of civil disobedience.\nThe philosopher H.\u00a0J. McCloskey argues that \"if violent, intimidatory, coercive disobedience is more effective, it is, other things being equal, more justified than less effective, nonviolent disobedience.\" In his best-selling \"Disobedience and Democracy: Nine Fallacies on Law and Order\", Howard Zinn takes a similar position; Zinn states that while the goals of civil disobedience are generally nonviolent,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;in the inevitable tension accompanying the transition from a violent world to a non-violent one, the choice of means will almost never be pure, and will involve such complexities that the simple distinction between violence and non-violence does not suffice as a guide\u00a0... the very acts with which we seek to do good cannot escape the imperfections of the world we are trying to change.\nZinn rejects any \"easy and righteous dismissal of violence\", noting that Thoreau, the popularizer of the term civil disobedience, approved of the armed insurrection of John Brown. He also notes that some major civil disobedience campaigns which have been classified as non-violent, such as the Birmingham campaign, have actually included elements of violence.\nRevolutionary vs. non-revolutionary.\nNon-revolutionary civil disobedience is a simple disobedience of laws on the grounds that they are judged \"wrong\" by a person's conscience, or as part of an effort to render certain laws ineffective, to cause their repeal, or to exert pressure to get one's political wishes on some other issue. Revolutionary civil disobedience is more of an active attempt to overthrow a government (or to change cultural traditions, social customs or religious beliefs). Revolution does not have to be political, i.e. \"cultural revolution\", it simply implies sweeping and widespread change to a section of the social fabric. Gandhi's acts have been described as revolutionary civil disobedience. It has been claimed that the Hungarians under Ferenc De\u00e1k directed revolutionary civil disobedience against the Austrian government. Thoreau also wrote of civil disobedience accomplishing \"peaceable revolution\". Howard Zinn, Harvey Wheeler, and others have identified the right espoused in the US Declaration of Independence to \"alter or abolish\" an unjust government to be a principle of civil disobedience.\nCollective vs. solitary.\nThe earliest recorded incidents of collective civil disobedience took place during the Roman Empire. Unarmed Jews gathered in the streets to prevent the installation of pagan images in the Temple in Jerusalem. In modern times, some activists who commit civil disobedience as a group collectively refuse to sign bail until certain demands are met, such as favourable bail conditions, or the release of all the activists. This is a form of jail solidarity. There have also been many instances of solitary civil disobedience, such as that committed by Thoreau, but these sometimes go unnoticed. Thoreau, at the time of his arrest, was not yet a well-known author, and his arrest was not covered in any newspapers in the days, weeks and months after it happened. The tax collector who arrested him rose to higher political office, and Thoreau's essay was not published until after the end of the Mexican War.\nChoices.\nAction.\nCivil disobedients have chosen a variety of different illegal acts. Hugo A. Bedau writes,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There is a whole class of acts, undertaken in the name of civil disobedience, which, even if they were widely practiced, would in themselves constitute hardly more than a nuisance (e.g. trespassing at a nuclear-missile installation)\u00a0... Such acts are often just a harassment and, at least to the bystander, somewhat inane\u00a0... The remoteness of the connection between the disobedient act and the objectionable law lays such acts open to the charge of ineffectiveness and absurdity.\nBedau also notes, though, that the very harmlessness of such entirely symbolic illegal protests toward public policy goals may serve a propaganda purpose. Some civil disobedients, such as the proprietors of illegal medical cannabis dispensaries and Voice in the Wilderness, which brought medicine to Iraq without the permission of the US government, directly achieve a desired social goal (such as the provision of medication to the sick) while openly breaking the law. Julia Butterfly Hill lived in Luna, a -tall, 600-year-old California Redwood tree for 738 days, preventing its felling.\nIn cases where the criminalized behaviour is pure speech, civil disobedience can consist simply of engaging in the forbidden speech. An example is WBAI's broadcasting of the bit \"Filthy Words\" from a George Carlin comedy album, which eventually led to the 1978 Supreme Court case of \"FCC v. Pacifica Foundation\". Threatening government officials is a way to express defiance toward the government and unwillingness to stand for its policies. For example, a supporter of some tax deniers in New Hampshire, Edward and Elaine Brown, was arrested for allegedly telling the local city councillors to \"Wise up or die.\"\nMore generally, protesters of particular victimless crimes often see fit to openly commit that crime. Laws against public nudity, for instance, have been protested by going naked in public, and laws against cannabis consumption have been protested by openly possessing it and using it at cannabis rallies.\nSome forms of civil disobedience, such as illegal boycotts, refusals to pay taxes, draft dodging, distributed denial-of-service attacks, and sit-ins, make it more difficult for a system to function. In this way, they might be considered coercive; coercive disobedience has the effect of exposing the enforcement of laws and policies, and it has even operated as an aesthetic strategy in contemporary art practice. Brownlee notes that \"although civil disobedients are constrained in their use of coercion by their conscientious aim to engage in moral dialogue, nevertheless they may find it necessary to employ limited coercion to get their issue onto the table\". The Plowshares organization temporarily closed GCSB Waihopai by padlocking the gates and using sickles to deflate one of the large domes covering two satellite dishes.\nElectronic civil disobedience can include web site defacements, redirects, denial-of-service attacks, information theft and data leaks, illegal web site parodies, virtual sit-ins, and virtual sabotage. It is distinct from other kinds of hacktivism in that the perpetrator openly reveals his identity. Virtual actions rarely succeed in completely shutting down their targets, but they often generate media attention.\nDilemma actions are designed to create a \"response dilemma\" for public authorities \"by forcing them to either concede some public space to protesters or make themselves look absurd or heavy-handed by acting against the protest.\"\nResponse to punishment.\nAs civil disobedience is intentionally breaking the law, people engaging in civil disobedience can expect to be arrested, criminally charged, tried, and legally punished for breaking the law. Protestors have to make choices about how to respond to each of these results. \nAl Sharpton, a civil rights and social justice activist, says that civil disobedients \"must be prepared to say the cause is more important than my freedom\" and not incorrectly believe themselves to have legal immunity or feel a sense of entitlement to break laws without being subject to the ordinary legal punishments for breaking those laws. \nArrest strategies.\nSome disciplines of civil disobedience hold that the protester must submit to arrest and cooperate with the authorities. Others advocate falling limp or resisting arrest, especially when it will hinder the police from effectively responding to a mass protest.\nMany of the same decisions and principles that apply in other criminal investigations and arrests arise also in civil disobedience cases. For example, the suspect may need to decide whether to grant a consent search of his property and whether to talk to police officers. It is generally agreed within the legal community, and is often believed within the activist community, that a suspect's talking to criminal investigators can serve no useful purpose and may be harmful. Some civil disobedients are compelled to respond to investigators' questions, sometimes by a misunderstanding of the legal ramifications or a fear of seeming rude. Also, some civil disobedients seek to use the arrest as an opportunity to make an impression on the officers. Thoreau wrote,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTrial strategies.\nSome civil disobedients feel it is incumbent upon them to accept punishment because of their belief in the validity of the social contract, which is held to bind all to obey the laws that a government meeting certain standards of legitimacy has established, or else suffer the penalties set out in the law. Other civil disobedients who favour the existence of government still do not believe in the legitimacy of their particular government or do not believe in the legitimacy of a particular law it has enacted. Anarchistic civil disobedients do not believe in the legitimacy of any government, so see no need to accept punishment for a violation of criminal law.\nPleading guilty.\nAn important decision for civil disobedients is whether to plead guilty. There is much debate on this point, as some believe that it is a civil disobedient's duty to submit to the punishment prescribed by law, while others believe that defending oneself in court will increase the possibility of changing the unjust law. It has also been argued that either choice is compatible with the spirit of civil disobedience. ACT UP's Civil Disobedience Training handbook states that a civil disobedient who pleads guilty is essentially stating, \"Yes, I committed the act of which you accuse me. I don't deny it; in fact, I am proud of it. I feel I did the right thing by violating this particular law; I am guilty as charged\", but that pleading not guilty sends a message of, \"Guilt implies wrong-doing. I feel I have done no wrong. I may have violated some specific laws, but I am guilty of doing no wrong. I, therefore, plead not guilty.\" A plea of no contest is sometimes regarded as a compromise between the two. One defendant accused of illegally protesting nuclear power, when asked to enter his plea, stated, \"I plead for the beauty that surrounds us\"; this is known as a \"creative plea\", and will usually be interpreted as a plea of not guilty.\nWhen the Committee for Non-Violent Action sponsored a protest in August 1957, at the Camp Mercury nuclear test site near Las Vegas, Nevada, 13 of the protesters attempted to enter the test site knowing that they faced arrest. At an announced time, one by one they crossed a line and were immediately arrested. They were put on a bus and taken to the Nye County seat of Tonopah, Nevada, and arraigned for trial before the local Justice of the Peace, that afternoon. A civil rights attorney, Francis Heisler, had volunteered to defend the accused, advising them to plead \"nolo contendere\" rather than guilty or not guilty. They were found guilty and given suspended sentences, conditional on not reentering the test site.\nHoward Zinn writes,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There may be many times when protesters \"choose\" to go to jail, as a way of continuing their protest, as a way of reminding their countrymen of injustice. But that is different than the notion that they \"must\" go to jail as part of a rule connected with civil disobedience. The key point is that the spirit of protest should be maintained all the way, whether it is done by remaining in jail, or by evading it. To accept jail penitently as an accession to \"the rules\" is to switch suddenly to a spirit of subservience, to demean the seriousness of the protest\u00a0... In particular, the neo-conservative insistence on a guilty plea should be eliminated.\nSometimes the prosecution proposes a plea bargain to civil disobedients, as in the case of the Camden 28, in which the defendants were offered an opportunity to plead guilty to one misdemeanour count and receive no jail time. In some mass arrest situations, the activists decide to use solidarity tactics to secure the same plea bargain for everyone. \nBut some activists have opted to enter a blind plea, pleading guilty without any plea agreement in place. Mahatma Gandhi pleaded guilty and told the court, \"I am here to\u00a0... submit cheerfully to the highest penalty that can be inflicted upon me for what in law is a deliberate crime and what appears to me to be the highest duty of a citizen.\"\nAllocution.\nSome civil disobedience defendants choose to make a defiant speech, or a speech explaining their actions, in allocution. In \"U.S. v. Burgos-Andujar\", a defendant who was involved in a movement to stop military exercises by trespassing on US Navy property argued to the court in allocution that \"the ones who are violating the greater law are the members of the Navy\". As a result, the judge increased her sentence from 40 to 60 days. This action was upheld because, according to the US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, her statement suggested a lack of remorse, an attempt to avoid responsibility for her actions, and even a likelihood of repeating her illegal actions. Some of the other allocution speeches given by the protesters complained about mistreatment from government officials.\nTim DeChristopher gave an allocution statement to the court describing the US as \"a place where the rule of law was created through acts of civil disobedience\" and arguing, \"Since those bedrock acts of civil disobedience by our founding fathers, the rule of law in this country has continued to grow closer to our shared higher moral code through the civil disobedience that drew attention to legalized injustice.\"\nTrial strategies.\nSteven Barkan writes that if defendants plead not guilty, \"they must decide whether their primary goal will be to win an acquittal and avoid imprisonment or a fine, or to use the proceedings as a forum to inform the jury and the public of the political circumstances surrounding the case and their reasons for breaking the law via civil disobedience.\" A technical defence may enhance the chances for acquittal but increase the possibility of additional proceedings and of reduced press coverage. During the Vietnam War era, the Chicago Eight used a political defence, but Benjamin Spock used a technical defence. In countries such as the United States, whose laws guarantee the right to a jury trial but do not excuse lawbreaking for political purposes, some civil disobedients seek jury nullification. Over the years, this has been made more difficult by court decisions such as \"Sparf v. United States\", which held that the judge need not inform jurors of their nullification prerogative, and \"United States v. Dougherty\", which held that the judge need not allow defendants to openly seek jury nullification.\nChoices made by the legal system.\nBritish judge Lord Hoffman writes that \"In deciding whether or not to impose punishment, the most important consideration would be whether it would do more harm than good. This means that the objector has no right not to be punished. It is a matter for the state (including the judges) to decide on utilitarian grounds whether to do so or not.\" Hoffman also asserted that while the \"rules of the game\" for civil disobedients were to remain non-violent while breaking the law, the authorities must recognize that demonstrators are acting out of their conscience in pursuit of democracy. \"When it comes to punishment, the court should take into account their personal convictions\", he said.\nChoices made by society.\nIn addition to legal action, civil disobedients may be affected socially. For example, student protesters may be suspended or expelled from school. Civil disobedients may be disowned by or become estranged from their families. Some employers may prefer to hire people who did not engage in civil disobedience or fire employees who do. \nLegal theory.\nGovernments have generally not recognized the legitimacy of civil disobedience or viewed political objectives as an excuse for breaking the law. Specifically, the law usually distinguishes between criminal motive and criminal intent; the offender's motives or purposes may be admirable and praiseworthy, but his intent may still be criminal. For example, a protester may be \"motivated by\" a desire to increase awareness about an injustice and \"intend\" to block traffic on a street, and it is the intention, rather than the motivation, that is criminally significant. Hence the saying that \"if there is any possible justification of civil disobedience, it must come from outside the legal system.\"\nOne theory is that, while disobedience may be helpful, any great amount of it undermines the law by encouraging general disobedience which is neither conscientious nor of social benefit. Therefore, conscientious lawbreakers must be punished. \nCourts have distinguished between two types of civil disobedience: \"Indirect civil disobedience involves violating a law which is not, itself, the object of protest, whereas direct civil disobedience involves protesting the existence of a particular law by breaking that law.\" \nDuring the Vietnam War, courts typically refused to excuse the perpetrators of illegal protests from punishment on the basis of their challenging the legality of the Vietnam War; the courts ruled it was a political question. The necessity defence has sometimes been used as a shadow defence by civil disobedients to deny guilt without denouncing their politically motivated acts, and to present their political beliefs in the courtroom. Court cases such as \"United States v. Schoon\" have greatly curtailed the availability of the political necessity defence. Likewise, when Carter Wentworth was charged for his role in the Clamshell Alliance's 1977 illegal occupation of the Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant, the judge instructed the jury to disregard his competing harms defence, and he was found guilty. Fully Informed Jury Association activists have sometimes handed out educational leaflets inside courthouses despite admonitions not to; according to the association, many of them have escaped prosecution because \"prosecutors have reasoned (correctly) that if they arrest fully informed jury leafleters, the leaflets will have to be given to the leafleter's own jury as evidence.\"\nAlong with giving the offender his just deserts, achieving crime control via incapacitation and deterrence is a major goal of criminal punishment. Brownlee says \"Bringing in deterrence at the level of justification detracts from the law's engagement in a moral dialogue with the offender as a rational person because it focuses attention on the threat of punishment and not the moral reasons to follow this law.\" \nActions that are outside of civil disobedience.\nMichael Bayles argues that if a person violates a law to create a test case as to the constitutionality of a law, and then wins his case, then that act did not constitute civil disobedience. \nBreaking the law for self-gratification, as in the case of a cannabis user who does not direct his act at securing the repeal of amendment of the law, is not civil disobedience. Likewise, a protester who attempts to escape punishment by committing the crime covertly and avoiding attribution, or by denying having committed the crime, or by fleeing the jurisdiction, is generally not called a civil disobedient.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It has a wide circulation which includes both hackers and computer security professionals.\nOriginally covering subjects related to phreaking, anarchy, and cracking, its articles now also cover a wide range of topics including cyber security, physical security, hacking, cryptography, counter culture, and international news.\n\"Phrack\" has been described as having \"its finger on the pulse of hacker culture\", and being \"hugely influential in the early days of hacker culture\".\nThe magazine is run and published by a team of international volunteers and security professionals. It is available for free.\nPublications.\nE-Zine Releases.\nIssues of \"Phrack\" are divided in volumes, covering one or more years of publication. Phrack's latest issue is #72.\nHardcopy Releases.\nSo far, there have been five major hardcopy releases and various smaller \"special edition\" hardcopy releases.\nEach major hardcopy release contains most (but not all) articles of the e-zine release. The printed edition is always released at hacker conferences/camps and always for free and usually a few days before the online release.\nOccasionally, \"Phrack\" releases a \"special edition\" hardcopy as well. These are smaller editions, containing three classic articles, three rejected articles (also known as \"Off The Record\" articles), and three articles from the upcoming release.\nHistory.\n\"Phrack\", first released on November 17, 1985, takes its name from the words \"phreak\" and \"hack\". The founding editors of the magazine, known by the pseudonyms \"Taran King\" and \"Knight Lightning\", edited most of the first thirty editions. Editions were originally released onto the \"Metal Shop\" bulletin board system, where Taran King was a sysop, and widely mirrored by other boards. Its headquarters was in Austin, Texas.\nDuring its first ten years of publication, \"Phrack\" was largely associated with telecommunications fraud, providing material for phreakers and information about arrests in the community through its Phrack World News feature articles. Along with the release of articles such as \"Smashing The Stack For Fun And Profit\" and the editorship of daemon9/route in 1996, \"Phrack\"'s orientation shifted toward computer security and its focus drew closer to the current definition of hacking (Cybersecurity).\nArrest of Knight Lightning.\nThe 24th issue of \"Phrack\", released February 1989, included a document relating to the workings of Enhanced 911 emergency response systems. This document was an administrative document describing which parts of the organization are responsible for what parts of the E911 system. It had been copied from a BellSouth computer and played a major part in a series of Secret Service raids called Operation Sundevil and is featured in Bruce Sterling's book \"The Hacker Crackdown\". \"Phrack\"'s editor, Knight Lightning, was arrested and charged with access device fraud and transportation of stolen property. The proceedings which ensued are known formally as \"United States v. Riggs\", named for Knight Lightning's co-defendant Robert Riggs.\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation filed an amicus brief supporting Knight Lightning, and helped to get the case dropped by introducing a witness who showed that Bellcore was selling more detailed documentation to the E911 system for as little as $13 to anyone who asked. The E911 document had initially been valued by the prosecution at almost $80,000. The case was then dropped.\nPre-2000.\nAfter the arrest of Knight Lightning, and the shutdown of \"Phrack\" by the US Secret Service in late December 1989 a few weeks after issue #30 was released, some attempts were made to resurrect \"Phrack\" under the editorship of Doc Holiday and Crimson Death. However, the lack of consent from the original editor to accept this \"Phrack Classic\" led to a new editorship for issue #33 by Dispater under the name \"Diet Phrack\" until issue #41.\nIssue #42 was released under the editorship of Erik Bloodaxe in 1992. In September 1994, the first \"Phrack\" website appeared with release #46, containing all of the files from the previous issues.\nWith the growing use of the Internet and interest in computer security, from 1996 \"Phrack\" became increasingly oriented toward computer security. The editorship was handed to route along with voyager until 2000 (release #56). During this period, the \"Phrack\" website was defaced several times and the magazine was often unavailable.\n2000-2006.\nSince 2001 Phrack has been edited under the alias Phrackstaff.\nIn 2005, it was announced that the current staff would retire, with the 63rd issue being its last release. A new leadership was expected to start releasing sometime in 2006/2007.\nTo commemorate \"Phrack\"'s final appearance, the 63rd issue was to be a hardback edition, released simultaneously at the DEF CON and What the Hack conventions on the 29th July 2005. An e-zine version of the release followed on a few days thereafter. The printer for the hardcopies of \"Phrack\" to be distributed at Defcon refused to fulfil the order once they realized that they were printing a hacking book. Two University of Arizona students filled the gap and printed between 100 and 200 copies of \"Phrack\" 63 in time for release at Defcon 13. The copies of \"Phrack\" 63 distributed at Defcon 13 are each stamped with a \"serial\" number on the inside of the last page. It is believed that there were 100 numbered copies of \"Phrack\" 63 distributed at Defcon. All copies were hand cut and bound; unnumbered copies may be unreleased \"extras\", or may have cutting errors that meant they were deemed them unfit for distribution.\n2007-2009.\nIssue 63 told readers to \"expect a new release\", and on May 27, 2007, issue 64 was released by a new board of editors who called themselves \"The Circle of Lost Hackers\" (TCLH). It consisted of a few old staff members and mostly new members. TCLH released four issues up until #66, released on June 11, 2009.\n2010-2023.\nThe editorship passed to a new staff who did four releases. The magazine declined in popularity. In 2023, the existing staff contacted many \"ancient\" staff members (all the way back to 1995: Route, Skyper, Grugq, Mayhem, ...) to discuss to continuation of Phrack or to shut it down for good.\nIt was decided to find a new editorial staff and to keep Phrack going. A new team was found. Some of the \"ancient\" staff joined as advisors.\n2024 onwards.\nIssue #71 was released as a hardcopy and an eZine on the 19th of August 2024.\nIssue #72 marked the 40th anniversary of the magazine and was celebrated with a massive release of around 15,000 printed editions and distributed (for free) at multiple hacker conferences around the world.\nContent.\n\"Phrack\" issues are released irregularly, and the issues are grouped into volumes. Each issue comprises a number of \"Philes\": Stand-alone text files of technical or counter-cultural content. \"Philes\" are submitted by members of the hacker underground community, and are reviewed by the editors for publication.\nIn addition to technical articles, \"Phrack\" also provides a focus for news and gossip among the hacker community.\nAt the 1990 National Computer Security Conference, Sheldon Zenner and Dorothy Denning suggested that \"Phrack\" articles contain the same factual content found in other computer and security magazines, but differed in tone.\nNotable articles.\n\"Phrack\" is especially popular due to the high technical standard of its releases compared to other cybersecurity publications and has made its reputation from a number of high-quality articles.\nRegular features.\nSeveral regular columns are present in most issues of \"Phrack\", such as:\nChallenge Coin.\nIn 2025, a limited edition of fifty golden \"Challenge Coins\" were created. These coins are given exclusively to past and future authors.\nThe engraving on the rim reads: \"I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto. You may stop this individual, but you can't stop us all...\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

He left home at age 14 to join the Catholic Christian Brotherhood. He became a monk, and spent 14 years in silence and prayer during his training.\nDuring the 1950s and 60s, Reggio worked as a social activist with Chicano street gangs with the Brotherhood in New Mexico. One of the brothers introduced him to the film \"Los Olvidados\" by the Spanish-French-Mexican surrealist filmmaker Luis Bunuel which influenced him greatly. He also acknowledges Artavazd Peleshyan, a documentary-poet, who was a mentor and friend.\nEarly work.\nReggio helped found the Institute for Regional Education in Santa Fe, New Mexico, a non-profit foundation. He became a founder of \"La Clinica de la Gente\", a facility providing medical care and service to 12,000 community members in northern New Mexico's barrios, as well as founding the Young Citizens for Action, a project aiding juveniles in the street gangs of Santa Fe.\nReggio worked with the American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico in 1972, to develop a media campaign dealing with the loss of privacy and the rise of surveillance, as well as the militarization of police in the U.S. during the post-Vietnam War era. The media campaign was presented on television, radio, billboards and in major newspapers.\nFilmmaker.\nReggio is widely known for his wordless filmography, especially the trilogy of \"Koyaanisqatsi\": \u201c\"Life Out of Balance\u201d; Powaqqatsi:\" \u201c\"Life in Transformation\"\u201d; and \"Naqoyqatsi:\" \u201c\"Life as War\u201d\". The film titles are taken from the Hopi language. His short film \"Evidence\" explores the effect of cinema on the minds of children, and his documentary \"Anima Mundi\" is a montage of images of over seventy animal species. His film \"Visitors\", which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival, consists for the most part of extended slow-motion closeups of people's faces, looking directly into the camera.\nIn 2022 Reggio released his film \"Once Within a Time\". It was produced by Steven Soderbergh and Alexander Rodnyansky and had its world premiere at Santa Fe International Film Festival (SFiFF) in October 2022. The festival awarded him the Lifetime Achievement Award.\nReggio has collaborated with the composer Philip Glass many times on the musical and orchestral soundtracks that augment Reggio\u2019s wordless films. He also collaborates with Jon Kane, a fellow filmmaker.\nIn 2014, Reggio was recognized by the Museum of Arts and Design in New York City with a full career retrospective titled \"Life with Technology: The Cinema of Godfrey Reggio\".\nThe bulk of Reggio's cinematic records, manuscripts, papers, photographs, film rolls, over forty years, have been acquired by Harvard University's Houghton Library, and the Harvard Film Archive.\nHis work continues with the Godfrey Reggio Foundation, which his wife Marti started in 2024. \nInfluences.\nIn an interview with \"Revus et Corriges,\" Reggio stated that he was particularly influenced by the work of experimental filmmakers such as Stan Brakhage and Maya Deren. Like these filmmakers, Reggio uses film as a medium for exploring the boundaries of perception and consciousness, using the camera as a tool for capturing the unseen and the intangible.\nPersonal life.\nSince the 1960s, Reggio has lived in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
