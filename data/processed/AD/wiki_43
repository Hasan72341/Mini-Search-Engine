It is a slightly brittle metal at room temperature and has a shiny blue whitish appearance when surface oxidation is removed. It is the first element in group 12 (IIB) of the periodic table. Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in Earth's crust, with an average concentration of 70 grams per ton. Zinc also has five stable isotopes; the most abundant of which, Zn-64, comprises nearly half of zinc's total abundance. In some respects, zinc is chemically similar to magnesium: both elements exhibit only one normal oxidation state (+2), and the Zn2+ and Mg2+ ions are of similar size. The most common zinc ore is sphalerite (zinc blende), a zinc sulfide mineral. The largest concentration of economically feasible lodes in descending order are located in China, Peru, and Australia, among others. Zinc is refined industrially by froth flotation of the ore, roasting, and final extraction using electricity (electrowinning).\nZinc is an essential trace element for humans, animals, plants and for microorganisms and is necessary for both prenatal and postnatal development. It is the second most abundant trace metal in humans after iron, an important cofactor for many enzymes, and the only metal which appears in all enzyme classes. Zinc is also an essential nutrient element for coral growth.\nEnzymes with a zinc atom in the reactive center are widespread in biochemistry, such as alcohol dehydrogenase in humans. Deficiency of zinc intake affects about two billion people in the developing world and is associated with many diseases. In children, deficiency causes growth retardation, delayed sexual maturation, infection susceptibility, and diarrhea. However, consumption of excess zinc may cause ataxia, lethargy, and copper deficiency. In marine biomes, notably within polar regions, a deficit of zinc can compromise the vitality of primary algal communities, potentially destabilizing the intricate marine trophic structures and consequently impacting biodiversity.\nBrass, an alloy of copper and zinc in various proportions, was used as early as the third millennium BC in the Aegean area and the region which currently includes Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kalmykia, Turkmenistan and Georgia. In the second millennium BC it was used in the regions currently including West India, Uzbekistan, Iran, Syria, Iraq, and Israel. Zinc metal was not produced on a large scale until the 12th century in India, though it was known to the ancient Romans and Greeks. The mines of Rajasthan have given definite archeological evidence of zinc production harking back to the 6th century BC. The oldest man-made pure zinc comes from Zawar, Rajasthan, as early as the 9th century AD, when a distillation process was utilized to make virtually pure zinc. Alchemists would burn zinc metal in air to form what they called \"philosopher's wool\" or \"white snow\" (zinc oxide, ZnO).\nThe element was probably named by the alchemist Paracelsus after the German word \"Zinke\" (prong, tooth). German chemist Andreas Sigismund Marggraf is credited with discovering pure metallic zinc in 1746. By 1800, work done by Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta had uncovered the electrochemical properties of zinc.\nPlating of corrosion-resistant zinc on iron, achieved by a process named hot-dip galvanization, is the major application for zinc. Other applications include electrical batteries, small non-structural casts, and alloys such as brass. A variety of zinc compounds are commonly used, such as zinc carbonate, zinc gluconate (as dietary supplements), zinc chloride (in deodorants), zinc pyrithione (anti-dandruff shampoos), and zinc sulfide (in luminescent paints). In addition, dimethylzinc and diethylzinc are used for the chemical syntheses of organic compounds.\nCharacteristics.\nPhysical properties.\nZinc is a bluish-white, lustrous, diamagnetic metal, though most common commercial grades of the metal have a dull finish. It is somewhat less dense than iron and has a hexagonal crystal structure, with a distorted form of hexagonal close packing, in which each atom has six nearest neighbors (at 265.9 pm) in its own plane and six others at a greater distance of 290.6 pm. The metal is hard and brittle at most temperatures but becomes malleable between 100 and 150\u00a0\u00b0C. Above 210\u00a0\u00b0C, the metal becomes brittle again and can be pulverized by beating. Zinc is a fair conductor of electricity. For a metal, zinc has relatively low melting (419.53\u00a0\u00b0C) and boiling point (907\u00a0\u00b0C). This melting point is the lowest of all the d-block metals aside from mercury and cadmium. For this reason among others, zinc, cadmium, and mercury are often not considered to be transition metals like the rest of the d-block metals.\nMany alloys contain zinc, the most famous example being brass. Other metals long known to form binary alloys with zinc are aluminium, antimony, bismuth, gold, iron, lead, mercury, silver, tin, magnesium, cobalt, nickel, tellurium, and sodium. Although neither zinc nor zirconium is ferromagnetic, their alloy, ZrZn2, exhibits ferromagnetism below 35\u00a0K.\nOccurrence.\nZinc makes up about 70\u00a0ppm\u00a0(0.007%) of Earth's crust in mass, making it the 24th-most abundant crustal element. It also makes up 312 ppm of the Solar System, where it is the 22nd most abundant element. Typical background concentrations of zinc do not exceed: 1 \u03bcg/m3 in atmosphere, 300\u00a0mg/kg in soil, 100\u00a0mg/kg in vegetation, 20 \u03bcg/L in freshwater, and 5 \u03bcg/L in seawater. The element is normally found in association with other base metals such as copper and lead in the form of ores. Zinc is a chalcophile, meaning the element is more likely to be found associated with sulfur and other heavy chalcogens, rather than with the light chalcogen oxygen or with non-chalcogen electronegative elements such as the halogens. Sulfides formed as the crust solidified under the highly reducing conditions of the young Earth's atmosphere. Sphalerite, a crystalline form of zinc sulfide, is the most heavily mined zinc-containing ore as it contains 60\u201362% zinc by mass.\nOther source minerals for zinc include smithsonite (zinc carbonate), hemimorphite (zinc silicate), wurtzite (another zinc sulfide), and sometimes hydrozincite (basic zinc carbonate). With the exception of wurtzite, all the other minerals were formed by weathering of the primordial zinc sulfides.\nCurrently identified zinc resources across the globe total 1.9\u20132.8\u00a0billion tonnes. Large deposits are in Australia, China, Canada, and the United States, with the largest potential reserves in Iran. The most recent estimate of reserve base for zinc (meets specified minimum physical criteria related to current mining and production practices) was made in 2009 and was calculated to be roughly 480 Mt. Zinc reserves, on the other hand, are geologically identified ore bodies whose suitability for recovery is economically practical (based on variables such as location, grade, quality, and quantity) at the time of determination. Since exploration and mine development is an ongoing process, the amount and number of zinc reserves is not a fixed number, and sustainability of zinc ore supplies cannot be judged by simply extrapolating the combined mine life of today's zinc mines. This concept is well supported by data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS), which illustrates that although refined zinc production increased 80% between 1990 and 2010, the reserve lifetime for zinc has remained unchanged, through the discovery of additional zinc deposits. About 346 million tonnes have been extracted throughout history up to 2002, and scholars have estimated that about 109\u2013305\u00a0million tonnes are presently in use.\nIsotopes.\nFive stable isotopes of zinc occur in nature, with 64Zn being the most abundant isotope (49.17% natural abundance). The other isotopes found in nature are 66Zn (27.73%), 67Zn (4.04%), 68Zn (18.45%), and 70Zn (0.61%).\nSeveral dozen radioisotopes have been characterized. 65Zn, which has a half-life of 243.66\u00a0days, is the least active radioisotope, followed by 72Zn with a half-life of 46.5\u00a0hours. Zinc has 10 nuclear isomers, of which 69mZn has the longest half-life, at 13.75 hours. The superscript \"m\" indicates a metastable isotope, whose nucleus is in an excited state and which will eventually return to its ground state, through the emission of excess energy in the form of one or more photons (gamma rays), with the nucleus decaying to the ground state by the end of the process.\nThe most common decay mode of a radioisotope of zinc with a mass number lower than 66 is electron capture. The resulting decay product will be an isotope of copper.\nZn + \u2192 Cu + \nThe most common decay mode of a radioisotope of zinc with a mass number higher than 66 is beta decay (\u03b2\u2212), producing an isotope of gallium.\nZn \u2192 Ga + + \nCompounds and chemistry.\nReactivity.\nZinc has an electron configuration of [Ar]4s23d10 and is a member of the group 12 of the periodic table. It is a moderately reactive metal and strong reducing agent; in the reactivity series it is comparable to manganese. The surface of the pure metal tarnishes quickly, eventually forming a protective passivating layer of the basic zinc carbonate, Zn5(OH)6(CO3)2, by reaction with atmospheric carbon dioxide.\nZinc burns in air with a bright bluish-green flame, giving off fumes of zinc oxide. Zinc reacts readily with acids, alkalis and other non-metals. Extremely pure zinc reacts only slowly at room temperature with acids. Strong acids, such as hydrochloric or sulfuric acid, can remove the passivating layer and the subsequent reaction with the acid releases hydrogen gas.\nZinc chemistry resembles that of the late first-row transition metals, nickel and copper, as well as certain main group elements. Almost all zinc compounds have the element in the +2 oxidation state. When Zn2&amp;plus; compounds form, the outer shell \"s\" electrons are lost, yielding a bare zinc ion with the electronic configuration [Ar]3d10. The filled interior \"d\" shell generally does not participate in bonding, producing diamagnetic and mostly colorless compounds. In aqueous solution an octahedral complex, [Zn(H2O)6]2+ is the predominant species.\nThe ionic radii of zinc and magnesium happen to be nearly identical. Consequently, some of the equivalent salts have the same crystal structure, and in other circumstances where ionic radius is a determining factor, the chemistry of zinc has much in common with that of magnesium. Compared to the transition metals, zinc tends to form bonds with a greater degree of covalency. Complexes with N- and S- donors are much more stable. Complexes of zinc are mostly 4- or 6- coordinate, although 5-coordinate complexes are known.\nOther oxidation states require unusual physical conditions, and the only positive oxidation states demonstrated are +1 or +2. The volatilization of zinc in combination with zinc chloride at temperatures above 285\u00a0\u00b0C indicates the formation of Zn2Cl2, a zinc compound with a +1 oxidation state. Calculations indicate that a zinc compound with the oxidation state of +4 is unlikely to exist. Zn(III) is predicted to exist in the presence of strongly electronegative trianions; however, there exists some doubt around this possibility.\nZinc(I) compounds.\nZinc(I) compounds are very rare. The [Zn2]2+ ion is implicated by the formation of a yellow diamagnetic glass by dissolving metallic zinc in molten ZnCl2. The [Zn2]2+ core would be analogous to the [Hg2]2+ cation present in mercury(I) compounds. The diamagnetic nature of the ion confirms its dimeric structure. The first zinc(I) compound containing the Zn\u2013Zn bond, (\u03b75-C5Me5)2Zn2 has been reported in 2004.\nZinc(II) compounds.\nBinary compounds of zinc are known for most of the metalloids and all the nonmetals except the noble gases. The oxide ZnO is a white powder that is nearly insoluble in neutral aqueous solutions, but is amphoteric, dissolving in both strong basic and acidic solutions. The other chalcogenides (ZnS, ZnSe, and ZnTe) have varied applications in electronics and optics. Pnictogenides (Zn3N2, Zn3P2, Zn3As2 and Zn3Sb2), the peroxide (ZnO2), the hydride (ZnH2), and the carbide (ZnC2) are also known. Of the four halides, ZnF2 has the most ionic character, while the others (ZnCl2, ZnBr2, and ZnI2) have relatively low melting points and are considered to have more covalent character.\nIn weak basic solutions containing Zn2+ ions, the hydroxide Zn(OH)2 forms as a white precipitate. In stronger alkaline solutions, this hydroxide is dissolved to form zincates ([Zn(OH)4]2-). The nitrate Zn(NO3)2, chlorate Zn(ClO3)2, sulfate ZnSO4, phosphate Zn3(PO4)2, molybdate ZnMoO4, cyanide Zn(CN)2, arsenite Zn(AsO2)2, arsenate Zn(AsO4)2\u00b78H2O and the chromate ZnCrO4 (one of the few colored zinc compounds) are a few examples of other common inorganic compounds of zinc.\nOrganozinc compounds are those that contain zinc\u2013carbon covalent bonds. Diethylzinc ((C2H5)2Zn) is a reagent in synthetic chemistry. It was first reported in 1848 from the reaction of zinc and ethyl iodide, and was the first compound known to contain a metal\u2013carbon sigma bond.\nTest for zinc.\nCobalticyanide paper (Rinnmann's test for Zn) can be used as a chemical indicator for zinc. 4\u00a0g of K3Co(CN)6 and 1\u00a0g of KClO3 is dissolved on 100\u00a0ml of water. Paper is dipped in the solution and dried at 100\u00a0\u00b0C. One drop of the sample is dropped onto the dry paper and heated. A green disc indicates the presence of zinc.\nHistory.\nAncient use.\nVarious isolated examples of the use of impure zinc in ancient times have been discovered. Zinc ores were used to make the zinc\u2013copper alloy brass thousands of years prior to the discovery of zinc as a separate element. Judean brass from the 14th to 10th centuries\u00a0BC contains 23% zinc.\nKnowledge of how to produce brass spread to Ancient Greece by the 7th\u00a0century\u00a0BC, but few varieties were made. Ornaments made of alloys containing 80\u201390% zinc, with lead, iron, antimony, and other metals making up the remainder, have been found that are 2,500 years old. A possibly prehistoric statuette containing 87.5% zinc was found in a Dacian archaeological site.\nStrabo writing in the 1st century BC (but quoting a now lost work of the 4th century BC historian Theopompus) mentions \"drops of false silver\" which when mixed with copper make brass. This may refer to small quantities of zinc that is a by-product of smelting sulfide ores. Zinc in such remnants in smelting ovens was usually discarded as it was thought to be worthless.\nThe manufacture of brass was known to the Romans by about 30\u00a0BC. They made brass by heating powdered calamine (zinc silicate or carbonate), charcoal and copper together in a crucible. The resulting calamine brass was then either cast or hammered into shape for use in weaponry. Some coins struck by Romans in the Christian era are made of what is probably calamine brass.\nThe oldest known pills were made of the zinc carbonates hydrozincite and smithsonite. The pills were used for sore eyes and were found aboard the Roman ship Relitto del Pozzino, wrecked in 140 BC.\nThe Berne zinc tablet is a votive plaque dating to Roman Gaul made of an alloy that is mostly zinc.\nThe Charaka Samhita, thought to have been written between 300 and 500 AD, mentions a metal which, when oxidized, produces \"pushpanjan\", thought to be zinc oxide. Zinc mines at Zawar, near Udaipur in India, have been active since the Mauryan period (c.\u2009322 and 187 BC). The smelting of metallic zinc here, however, appears to have begun around the 12th century AD. One estimate is that this location produced an estimated million tonnes of metallic zinc and zinc oxide from the 12th to 16th centuries. Another estimate gives a total production of 60,000 tonnes of metallic zinc over this period. The Rasaratna Samuccaya, written in approximately the 13th century AD, mentions two types of zinc-containing ores: one used for metal extraction and another used for medicinal purposes.\nEarly studies and naming.\nZinc was distinctly recognized as a metal under the designation of \"Yasada\" or Jasada in the medical Lexicon ascribed to the Hindu king Madanapala (of Taka dynasty) and written about the year 1374. Smelting and extraction of impure zinc by reducing calamine with wool and other organic substances was accomplished in the 13th century in India. The Chinese did not learn of the technique until the 17th century.\nAlchemists burned zinc metal in air and collected the resulting zinc oxide (ZnO) on a condenser. Some alchemists called this zinc oxide \"lana philosophica\", Latin for \"philosopher's wool\", because it collected in woolly tufts, whereas others thought it looked like white snow and named it \"nix album\".\nThe name of the metal was probably first documented by Paracelsus, a Swiss-born German alchemist, who referred to the metal as \"zincum\" or \"zinken\" in his book \"Liber Mineralium II\", in the 16th century. The word is probably derived from the German , and supposedly meant \"tooth-like, pointed or jagged\" (metallic zinc crystals have a needle-like appearance). \"Zink\" could also imply \"tin-like\" because of its relation to German \"zinn\" meaning tin. Yet another possibility is that the word is derived from the Persian word \"seng\" meaning stone. The metal was also called \"Indian tin\", \"tutanego\", \"calamine\", and \"spinter\".\nGerman metallurgist Andreas Libavius received a quantity of what he called \"calay\" (from the Malay or Hindi word for tin) originating from Malabar off a cargo ship captured from the Portuguese in the year 1596. Libavius described the properties of the sample, which may have been zinc. Zinc was regularly imported to Europe from the Orient in the 17th and early 18th centuries, but was at times very expensive.\nIsolation.\nMetallic zinc was isolated in India by 1300 AD. Before it was isolated in Europe, it was imported from India in about 1600 CE. Postlewayt's \"Universal Dictionary\", a contemporary source giving technological information in Europe, did not mention zinc before 1751 but the element was studied before then.\nFlemish metallurgist and alchemist P. M. de Respour reported that he had extracted metallic zinc from zinc oxide in 1668. By the start of the 18th century, \u00c9tienne Fran\u00e7ois Geoffroy described how zinc oxide condenses as yellow crystals on bars of iron placed above zinc ore that is being smelted. In Britain, John Lane is said to have carried out experiments to smelt zinc, probably at Landore, prior to his bankruptcy in 1726.\nIn 1738 in Great Britain, William Champion patented a process to extract zinc from calamine in a vertical retort-style smelter. His technique resembled that used at Zawar zinc mines in Rajasthan, but no evidence suggests he visited the Orient. Champion's process was used through 1851.\nGerman chemist Andreas Marggraf normally gets credit for isolating pure metallic zinc in the West, even though Swedish chemist Anton von Swab had distilled zinc from calamine four years previously. In his 1746 experiment, Marggraf heated a mixture of calamine and charcoal in a closed vessel without copper to obtain a metal. This procedure became commercially practical by 1752.\nLater work.\nWilliam Champion's brother, John, patented a process in 1758 for calcining zinc sulfide into an oxide usable in the retort process. Prior to this, only calamine could be used to produce zinc. In 1798, Johann Christian Ruberg improved on the smelting process by building the first horizontal retort smelter. Jean-Jacques Daniel Dony built a different kind of horizontal zinc smelter in Belgium that processed even more zinc.\nItalian doctor Luigi Galvani discovered in 1780 that connecting the spinal cord of a freshly dissected frog to an iron rail attached by a brass hook caused the frog's leg to twitch. He incorrectly thought he had discovered an ability of nerves and muscles to create electricity and called the effect \"animal electricity\". The galvanic cell and the process of galvanization were both named after Luigi Galvani, and his discoveries paved the way for electrical batteries, galvanization, and cathodic protection.\nGalvani's friend, Alessandro Volta, continued researching the effect and invented the Voltaic pile in 1800. Volta's pile consisted of a stack of simplified galvanic cells, each being one plate of copper and one of zinc connected by an electrolyte. By stacking these units in series, the Voltaic pile (or \"battery\") as a whole had a higher voltage, which could be used more easily than single cells. Electricity is produced because the Volta potential between the two metal plates makes electrons flow from the zinc to the copper and corrode the zinc.\nThe non-magnetic character of zinc and its lack of color in solution delayed discovery of its importance to biochemistry and nutrition. This changed in 1940 when carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme that scrubs carbon dioxide from blood, was shown to have zinc in its active site. The digestive enzyme carboxypeptidase became the second known zinc-containing enzyme in 1955.\nProduction.\nMining and processing.\nZinc is the fourth most common metal in use, trailing only iron, aluminium, and copper with an annual production of about 13 million tonnes. The world's largest zinc producer is Nyrstar, a merger of the Australian OZ Minerals and the Belgian Umicore. About 70% of the world's zinc originates from mining, while the remaining 30% comes from recycling secondary zinc.\nCommercially pure zinc is known as Special High Grade, often abbreviated \"SHG\", and is 99.995% pure.\nWorldwide, 95% of new zinc is mined from sulfidic ore deposits, in which sphalerite (ZnS) is nearly always mixed with the sulfides of copper, lead and iron.6 Zinc mines are scattered throughout the world, with the main areas being China, Australia, and Peru. China produced 38% of the global zinc output in 2014.\nZinc metal is produced using extractive metallurgy.7 The ore is finely ground, then put through froth flotation to separate minerals from gangue (on the property of hydrophobicity), to get a zinc sulfide ore concentrate16 consisting of about 50% zinc, 32% sulfur, 13% iron, and 5% SiO2.16\nRoasting converts the zinc sulfide concentrate to zinc oxide:\n&lt;chem&gt;2ZnS + 3O2 -&gt;[t^o] 2ZnO + 2SO2&lt;/chem&gt;\nThe sulfur dioxide is used for the production of sulfuric acid, which is necessary for the leaching process. If deposits of zinc carbonate, zinc silicate, or zinc-spinel (like the Skorpion Deposit in Namibia) are used for zinc production, the roasting can be omitted.\nFor further processing two basic methods are used: pyrometallurgy or electrowinning. Pyrometallurgy reduces zinc oxide with carbon or carbon monoxide at into the metal, which is distilled as zinc vapor to separate it from other metals, which are not volatile at those temperatures. The zinc vapor is collected in a condenser. The equations below describe this process:\n &lt;chem&gt;ZnO + C -&gt;[950^oC] Zn + CO&lt;/chem&gt;\n &lt;chem&gt;ZnO + CO -&gt;[950^oC] Zn + CO2&lt;/chem&gt;\nIn electrowinning, zinc is leached from the ore concentrate by sulfuric acid and impurities are precipitated:\n&lt;chem&gt;ZnO + H2SO4 -&gt; ZnSO4 + H2O&lt;/chem&gt;\nFinally, the zinc is reduced by electrolysis.\n&lt;chem&gt;2ZnSO4 + 2H2O -&gt; 2Zn + O2 + 2H2SO4&lt;/chem&gt;\nThe sulfuric acid is regenerated and recycled to the leaching step.\nWhen galvanised feedstock is fed to an electric arc furnace, the zinc is recovered from the dust by a number of processes, predominantly the Waelz process (90% as of 2014).\nEnvironmental impact.\nRefinement of sulfidic zinc ores produces large volumes of sulfur dioxide and cadmium vapor. Smelter slag and other residues contain significant quantities of metals. About 1.1\u00a0million tonnes of metallic zinc and 130 thousand tonnes of lead were mined and smelted in the Belgian towns of La Calamine and Plombi\u00e8res between 1806 and 1882. The dumps of the past mining operations leach zinc and cadmium, and the sediments of the Geul River contain non-trivial amounts of metals. About two thousand years ago, emissions of zinc from mining and smelting totaled 10 thousand tonnes a year. After increasing 10-fold from 1850, zinc emissions peaked at 3.4\u00a0million tonnes per year in the 1980s and declined to 2.7\u00a0million tonnes in the 1990s, although a 2005 study of the Arctic troposphere found that the concentrations there did not reflect the decline. Man-made and natural emissions occur at a ratio of 20\u00a0to\u00a01.\nZinc in rivers flowing through industrial and mining areas can be as high as 20\u00a0ppm. Effective sewage treatment greatly reduces this; treatment along the Rhine, for example, has decreased zinc levels to 50\u00a0ppb. Concentrations of zinc as low as 2\u00a0ppm adversely affects the amount of oxygen that fish can carry in their blood.\nSoils contaminated with zinc from mining, refining, or fertilizing with zinc-bearing sludge can contain several grams of zinc per kilogram of dry soil. Levels of zinc in excess of 500\u00a0ppm in soil interfere with the ability of plants to absorb other essential metals, such as iron and manganese. Zinc levels of 2000\u00a0ppm to 180,000\u00a0ppm (18%) have been recorded in some soil samples.\nApplications.\nMajor applications of zinc include, with percentages given for the US\nAnti-corrosion and batteries.\nZinc is most commonly used as an anti-corrosion agent, and galvanization (coating of iron or steel) is the most familiar form. In 2009 in the United States, 55% or 893,000 tons of the zinc metal was used for galvanization.\nZinc is more reactive than iron or steel and thus will attract almost all local oxidation until it completely corrodes away. A protective surface layer of oxide and carbonate (Zn5(OH)6(CO3)2) forms as the zinc corrodes. This protection lasts even after the zinc layer is scratched but degrades through time as the zinc corrodes away. The zinc is applied electrochemically or as molten zinc by hot-dip galvanizing or spraying. Galvanization is used on chain-link fencing, guard rails, suspension bridges, lightposts, metal roofs, heat exchangers, and car bodies.\nThe relative reactivity of zinc and its ability to attract oxidation to itself makes it an efficient sacrificial anode in cathodic protection (CP). For example, cathodic protection of a buried pipeline can be achieved by connecting anodes made from zinc to the pipe. Zinc acts as the anode (negative terminus) by slowly corroding away as it passes electric current to the steel pipeline. Zinc is also used to cathodically protect metals that are exposed to sea water. A zinc disc attached to a ship's iron rudder will slowly corrode while the rudder stays intact. Similarly, a zinc plug attached to a propeller or the metal protective guard for the keel of the ship provides temporary protection.\nWith a standard electrode potential (SEP) of \u22120.76 volts, zinc is used as an anode material for primary cells. (More reactive lithium (SEP \u22123.04 V) is used for anodes in lithium batteries ). Powdered zinc is used in this way alkaline batteries and the case (which also serves as the anode) of zinc\u2013carbon batteries is formed from sheet zinc. There are also efforts to use zinc as anode material in secondary cells with a comparable cell chemistry, for example by advanced electrolytes. Zinc is used as the anode or fuel of the zinc\u2013air battery/fuel cell. The zinc-cerium redox flow battery also relies on a zinc-based negative half-cell.\nAlloys.\nA widely used zinc alloy is brass, in which copper is alloyed with anywhere from 3% to 45% zinc, depending upon the type of brass. Brass is generally more ductile and stronger than copper, and has superior corrosion resistance. These properties make it useful in communication equipment, hardware, musical instruments, and water valves.\nOther widely used zinc alloys include nickel silver, typewriter metal, soft and aluminium solder, and commercial bronze. Zinc is also used in contemporary pipe organs as a substitute for the traditional lead/tin alloy in pipes. Alloys of 85\u201388% zinc, 4\u201310% copper, and 2\u20138% aluminium find limited use in certain types of machine bearings. Zinc has been the primary metal in American one cent coins (pennies) since 1982. The zinc core is coated with a thin layer of copper to give the appearance of a copper coin. In 1994, of zinc were used to produce 13.6\u00a0billion pennies in the United States.\nAlloys of zinc with small amounts of copper, aluminium, and magnesium are useful in die casting as well as spin casting, especially in the automotive, electrical, and hardware industries. These alloys are marketed under the name Zamak. An example of this is zinc aluminium. The low melting point together with the low viscosity of the alloy makes possible the production of small and intricate shapes. The low working temperature leads to rapid cooling of the cast products and fast production for assembly. Another alloy, marketed under the brand name Prestal, contains 78% zinc and 22% aluminium, and is reported to be nearly as strong as steel but as malleable as plastic. This superplasticity of the alloy allows it to be molded using die casts made of ceramics and cement.\nSimilar alloys with the addition of a small amount of lead can be cold-rolled into sheets. An alloy of 96% zinc and 4% aluminium is used to make stamping dies for low production run applications for which ferrous metal dies would be too expensive. For building facades, roofing, and other applications for sheet metal formed by deep drawing, roll forming, or bending, zinc alloys with titanium and copper are used. Unalloyed zinc is too brittle for these manufacturing processes.\nAs a dense, inexpensive, easily worked material, zinc is used as a lead replacement. In the wake of lead concerns, zinc appears in weights for various applications ranging from fishing to tire balances and flywheels.\nCadmium zinc telluride (CZT) is a semiconductive alloy that can be divided into an array of small sensing devices. These devices are similar to an integrated circuit and can detect the energy of incoming gamma ray photons. When behind an absorbing mask, the CZT sensor array can determine the direction of the rays.\nOther industrial uses.\nRoughly one quarter of all zinc output in the United States in 2009 was consumed in zinc compounds; a variety of which are used industrially. Zinc oxide is widely used as a white pigment in paints and as a catalyst in the manufacture of rubber to disperse heat. Zinc oxide is used to protect rubber polymers and plastics from ultraviolet radiation (UV). The semiconductor properties of zinc oxide make it useful in varistors and photocopying products. The zinc zinc-oxide cycle is a two step thermochemical process based on zinc and zinc oxide for hydrogen production.\nZinc chloride is often added to lumber as a fire retardant and sometimes as a wood preservative. It is used in the manufacture of other chemicals. Zinc methyl (Zn(CH3)2) is used in a number of organic syntheses. Zinc sulfide (ZnS) is used in luminescent pigments such as on the hands of clocks, X-ray and television screens, and luminous paints. Crystals of ZnS are used in lasers that operate in the mid-infrared part of the spectrum. Zinc sulfate is a chemical in dyes and pigments. Zinc pyrithione is used in antifouling paints.\nZinc powder is sometimes used as a propellant in model rockets. When a compressed mixture of 70% zinc and 30% sulfur powder is ignited there is a violent chemical reaction. This produces zinc sulfide, together with large amounts of hot gas, heat, and light.\nZinc sheet metal is used as a durable covering for roofs, walls, and countertops, the last often seen in bistros and oyster bars, and is known for the rustic look imparted by its surface oxidation in use to a blue-gray patina and susceptibility to scratching.\n64Zn, the most abundant isotope of zinc, is very susceptible to neutron activation, being transmuted into the highly radioactive 65Zn, which has a half-life of 244 days and produces intense gamma radiation. Because of this, zinc oxide used in nuclear reactors as an anti-corrosion agent is depleted of 64Zn before use, this is called depleted zinc oxide. For the same reason, zinc has been proposed as a salting material for nuclear weapons (cobalt is another, better-known salting material). A jacket of isotopically enriched 64Zn would be irradiated by the intense high-energy neutron flux from an exploding thermonuclear weapon, forming a large amount of 65Zn significantly increasing the radioactivity of the weapon's fallout. Such a weapon is not known to have ever been built, tested, or used.\n65Zn is used as a tracer to study how alloys that contain zinc wear out, or the path and the role of zinc in organisms.\nZinc dithiocarbamate complexes are used as agricultural fungicides; these include Zineb, Metiram, Propineb and Ziram. Zinc naphthenate is used as wood preservative. Zinc in the form of ZDDP, is used as an anti-wear additive for metal parts in engine oil.\nOrganic chemistry.\nOrganozinc chemistry is the science of compounds that contain carbon-zinc bonds, describing the physical properties, synthesis, and chemical reactions. Many organozinc compounds are commercially important. Among important applications are:\nZinc has found many uses in catalysis in organic synthesis including enantioselective synthesis, being a cheap and readily available alternative to precious metal complexes. Quantitative results (yield and enantiomeric excess) obtained with chiral zinc catalysts can be comparable to those achieved with palladium, ruthenium, iridium and others.\nDietary supplement.\nIn most single-tablet, over-the-counter, daily vitamin and mineral supplements, zinc is included in such forms as zinc oxide, zinc acetate, zinc gluconate, or zinc amino acid chelate.\nGenerally, zinc supplement is recommended where there is high risk of zinc deficiency (such as low and middle income countries) as a preventive measure. Although zinc sulfate is a commonly used zinc form, zinc citrate, gluconate and picolinate may be valid options as well. These forms are better absorbed than zinc oxide.\nGastroenteritis.\nZinc is an inexpensive and effective part of treatment of diarrhea among children in the developing world. Zinc becomes depleted in the body during diarrhea and replenishing zinc with a 10- to 14-day course of treatment can reduce the duration and severity of diarrheal episodes and may also prevent future episodes for as long as three months. Gastroenteritis is strongly attenuated by ingestion of zinc, possibly by direct antimicrobial action of the ions in the gastrointestinal tract, or by the absorption of the zinc and re-release from immune cells (all granulocytes secrete zinc), or both.\nWeight gain.\nZinc deficiency may lead to loss of appetite. The use of zinc in the treatment of anorexia has been advocated since 1979. At least 15 clinical trials have shown that zinc improved weight gain in anorexia. A 1994 trial showed that zinc doubled the rate of body mass increase in the treatment of anorexia nervosa. Deficiency of other nutrients such as tyrosine, tryptophan and thiamine could contribute to this phenomenon of \"malnutrition-induced malnutrition\".\nA meta-analysis of 33 prospective intervention trials regarding zinc supplementation and its effects on the growth of children in many countries showed that zinc supplementation alone had a statistically significant effect on linear growth and body weight gain, indicating that other deficiencies that may have been present were not responsible for growth retardation.\nOther.\nPeople taking zinc supplements may slow down the progress to age-related macular degeneration. Zinc supplement is an effective treatment for acrodermatitis enteropathica, a genetic disorder affecting zinc absorption that was previously fatal to affected infants. Zinc deficiency has been associated with major depressive disorder (MDD), and zinc supplements may be an effective treatment. Zinc may help individuals sleep more.\nTopical use.\nTopical preparations of zinc include those used on the skin, often in the form of zinc oxide. Zinc oxide is generally recognized by the FDA as safe and effective and is considered a very photo-stable. Zinc oxide is one of the most common active ingredients formulated into a sunscreen to mitigate sunburn. Applied thinly to a baby's diaper area (perineum) with each diaper change, it can protect against diaper rash.\nChelated zinc is used in toothpastes and mouthwashes to prevent bad breath; zinc citrate helps reduce the build-up of calculus (tartar).\nZinc pyrithione is widely included in shampoos to prevent dandruff.\nTopical zinc has also been shown to effectively treat, as well as prolong remission in genital herpes.\nBiological role.\nZinc is an essential trace element for humans. and other animals, for plants and for microorganisms. Zinc is required for the function of over 300 enzymes and 1000 transcription factors, and is stored and transferred in metallothioneins. It is the second most abundant trace metal in humans after iron and it is the only metal which appears in all enzyme classes.\nIn proteins, zinc ions are often coordinated to the amino acid side chains of aspartic acid, glutamic acid, cysteine and histidine. The theoretical and computational description of this zinc binding in proteins (as well as that of other transition metals) is difficult.\nRoughly 2\u20134\u00a0grams of zinc are distributed throughout the human body. Most zinc is in the brain, muscle, bones, kidney, and liver, with the highest concentrations in the prostate and parts of the eye. Semen is particularly rich in zinc, a key factor in prostate gland function and reproductive organ growth.\nZinc homeostasis of the body is mainly controlled by the intestine. Here, ZIP4 and especially TRPM7 were linked to intestinal zinc uptake essential for postnatal survival.\nIn humans, the biological roles of zinc are ubiquitous. It interacts with \"a wide range of organic ligands\", and has roles in the metabolism of RNA and DNA, signal transduction, and gene expression. It also regulates apoptosis. A review from 2015 indicated that about 10% of human proteins (~3000) bind zinc, in addition to hundreds more that transport and traffic zinc; a similar \"in silico\" study in the plant \"Arabidopsis thaliana\" found 2367 zinc-related proteins.\nIn the brain, zinc is stored in specific synaptic vesicles by glutamatergic neurons and can modulate neuronal excitability. It plays a key role in synaptic plasticity and so in learning. Zinc homeostasis also plays a critical role in the functional regulation of the central nervous system. Dysregulation of zinc homeostasis in the central nervous system that results in excessive synaptic zinc concentrations is believed to induce neurotoxicity through mitochondrial oxidative stress (e.g., by disrupting certain enzymes involved in the electron transport chain, including complex I, complex III, and \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase), the dysregulation of calcium homeostasis, glutamatergic neuronal excitotoxicity, and interference with intraneuronal signal transduction. L- and D-histidine facilitate brain zinc uptake. SLC30A3 is the primary zinc transporter involved in cerebral zinc homeostasis.\nEnzymes.\nZinc is an efficient Lewis acid, making it a useful catalytic agent in hydroxylation and other enzymatic reactions. The metal also has a flexible coordination geometry, which allows proteins using it to rapidly shift conformations to perform biological reactions. Two examples of zinc-containing enzymes are carbonic anhydrase and carboxypeptidase, which are vital to the processes of carbon dioxide (CO2) regulation and digestion of proteins, respectively.\nIn vertebrate blood, carbonic anhydrase converts CO2 into bicarbonate and the same enzyme transforms the bicarbonate back into CO2 for exhalation through the lungs. Without this enzyme, this conversion would occur about one million times slower at the normal blood pH of 7 or would require a pH of 10 or more. The non-related \u03b2-carbonic anhydrase is required in plants for leaf formation, the synthesis of indole acetic acid (auxin) and alcoholic fermentation.\nCarboxypeptidase cleaves peptide linkages during digestion of proteins. A coordinate covalent bond is formed between the terminal peptide and a C=O group attached to zinc, which gives the carbon a positive charge. This helps to create a hydrophobic pocket on the enzyme near the zinc, which attracts the non-polar part of the protein being digested.\nSignalling.\nZinc has been recognized as a messenger, able to activate signalling pathways. Many of these pathways provide the driving force in aberrant cancer growth. They can be targeted through ZIP transporters.\nOther proteins.\nZinc serves a purely structural role in zinc fingers, twists and clusters. Zinc fingers form parts of some transcription factors, which are proteins that recognize DNA base sequences during the replication and transcription of DNA. Each of the nine or ten Zn2+ ions in a zinc finger helps maintain the finger's structure by coordinately binding to four amino acids in the transcription factor.\nIn blood plasma, zinc is bound to and transported by albumin (60%, low-affinity) and transferrin (10%). Because transferrin also transports iron, excessive iron reduces zinc absorption, and vice versa. A similar antagonism exists with copper. The concentration of zinc in blood plasma stays relatively constant regardless of zinc intake. Cells in the salivary gland, prostate, immune system, and intestine use zinc signaling to communicate with other cells.\nZinc may be held in metallothionein reserves within microorganisms or in the intestines or liver of animals. Metallothionein in intestinal cells is capable of adjusting absorption of zinc by 15\u201340%. However, inadequate or excessive zinc intake can be harmful; excess zinc particularly impairs copper absorption because metallothionein absorbs both metals.\nThe human dopamine transporter contains a high affinity extracellular zinc binding site which, upon zinc binding, inhibits dopamine reuptake and amplifies amphetamine-induced dopamine efflux \"in vitro\". The human serotonin transporter and norepinephrine transporter do not contain zinc binding sites. Some EF-hand calcium binding proteins such as S100 or NCS-1 are also able to bind zinc ions.\nNutrition.\nDietary recommendations.\nThe U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for zinc in 2001. The current EARs for zinc for women and men ages 14 and up is 6.8 and 9.4\u00a0mg/day, respectively. The RDAs are 8 and 11\u00a0mg/day. RDAs are higher than EARs so as to identify amounts that will cover people with higher than average requirements. RDA for pregnancy is 11\u00a0mg/day. RDA for lactation is 12\u00a0mg/day. For infants up to 12 months the RDA is 3\u00a0mg/day. For children ages 1\u201313 years the RDA increases with age from 3 to 8\u00a0mg/day. As for safety, the IOM sets Tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of zinc the adult UL is 40\u00a0mg/day including both food and supplements combined (lower for children). Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs).\nThe European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL are defined the same as in the United States. For people ages 18 and older the PRI calculations are complex, as the EFSA has set higher and higher values as the phytate content of the diet increases. For women, PRIs increase from 7.5 to 12.7\u00a0mg/day as phytate intake increases from 300 to 1200\u00a0mg/day; for men the range is 9.4 to 16.3\u00a0mg/day. These PRIs are higher than the U.S. RDAs. The EFSA reviewed the same safety question and set its UL at 25\u00a0mg/day, which is much lower than the U.S. value.\nFor U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV). For zinc labeling purposes 100% of the Daily Value was 15\u00a0mg, but on May 27, 2016, it was revised to 11\u00a0mg. A table of the old and new adult daily values is provided at Reference Daily Intake.\nDietary intake.\nAnimal products such as meat, fish, shellfish, fowl, eggs, and dairy contain zinc. The concentration of zinc in plants varies with the level in the soil. With adequate zinc in the soil, the food plants that contain the most zinc are wheat (germ and bran) and various seeds, including sesame, poppy, alfalfa, celery, and mustard. Zinc is also found in beans, nuts, almonds, whole grains, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and blackcurrant.\nOther sources include fortified food and dietary supplements in various forms. A 1998 review concluded that zinc oxide, one of the most common supplements in the United States, and zinc carbonate are nearly insoluble and poorly absorbed in the body. This review cited studies that found lower plasma zinc concentrations in the subjects who consumed zinc oxide and zinc carbonate than in those who took zinc acetate and sulfate salts. For fortification, however, a 2003 review recommended cereals (containing zinc oxide) as a cheap, stable source that is as easily absorbed as the more expensive forms. A 2005 study found that various compounds of zinc, including oxide and sulfate, did not show statistically significant differences in absorption when added as fortificants to maize tortillas.\nDeficiency.\nNearly two billion people in the developing world are deficient in zinc. Groups at risk include children in developing countries and elderly with chronic illnesses. In children, it causes an increase in infection and diarrhea and contributes to the death of about 800,000 children worldwide per year. The World Health Organization advocates zinc supplementation for severe malnutrition and diarrhea. Zinc supplements help prevent disease and reduce mortality, especially among children with low birth weight or stunted growth. However, zinc supplements should not be administered alone, because many in the developing world have several deficiencies, and zinc interacts with other micronutrients. While zinc deficiency is usually due to insufficient dietary intake, it can be associated with malabsorption, acrodermatitis enteropathica, chronic liver disease, chronic renal disease, sickle cell disease, diabetes, malignancy, and other chronic illnesses.\nIn the United States, a federal survey of food consumption determined that for women and men over the age of 19, average consumption was 9.7 and 14.2\u00a0mg/day, respectively. For women, 17% consumed less than the EAR, for men 11%. The percentages below EAR increased with age. The most recent published update of the survey (NHANES 2013\u20132014) reported lower averages \u2013 9.3 and 13.2\u00a0mg/day \u2013 again with intake decreasing with age.\nSymptoms of mild zinc deficiency are diverse. Clinical outcomes include depressed growth, diarrhea, impotence and delayed sexual maturation, alopecia, eye and skin lesions, impaired appetite, altered cognition, impaired immune functions, defects in carbohydrate use, and reproductive teratogenesis. Zinc deficiency depresses immunity, but excessive zinc does also.\nDespite some concerns, western vegetarians and vegans do not suffer any more from overt zinc deficiency than meat-eaters. Major plant sources of zinc include cooked dried beans, sea vegetables, fortified cereals, soy foods, nuts, peas, and seeds. However, phytates in many whole-grains and fibers may interfere with zinc absorption and marginal zinc intake has poorly understood effects. The zinc chelator phytate, found in seeds and cereal bran, can contribute to zinc malabsorption. Some evidence suggests that more than the US RDA (8\u00a0mg/day for adult women; 11\u00a0mg/day for adult men) may be needed in those whose diet is high in phytates, such as some vegetarians. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) guidelines attempt to compensate for this by recommending higher zinc intake when dietary phytate intake is greater. These considerations must be balanced against the paucity of adequate zinc biomarkers, and the most widely used indicator, plasma zinc, has poor sensitivity and specificity.\nSoil remediation.\nSpecies of \"Calluna\", \"Erica\" and \"Vaccinium\" can grow in zinc-metalliferous soils, because translocation of toxic ions is prevented by the action of ericoid mycorrhizal fungi.\nAgriculture.\nZinc deficiency appears to be the most common micronutrient deficiency in crop plants; it is particularly common in high-pH soils. Zinc-deficient soil is cultivated in the cropland of about half of Turkey and India, a third of China, and most of Western Australia. Substantial responses to zinc fertilization have been reported in these areas. Plants that grow in soils that are zinc-deficient are more susceptible to disease. Zinc is added to the soil primarily through the weathering of rocks, but humans have added zinc through fossil fuel combustion, mine waste, phosphate fertilizers, pesticide (zinc phosphide), limestone, manure, sewage sludge, and particles from galvanized surfaces. Excess zinc is toxic to plants, although zinc toxicity is far less widespread.\nPrecautions.\nToxicity.\nAlthough zinc is an essential requirement for good health, excess zinc can be harmful. Excessive absorption of zinc suppresses copper and iron absorption. The free zinc ion in solution is highly toxic to plants, invertebrates, and even vertebrate fish. The Free Ion Activity Model is well-established in the literature, and shows that just micromolar amounts of the free ion kills some organisms. A recent example showed 6 micromolar killing 93% of all \"Daphnia\" in water.\nThe free zinc ion is a powerful Lewis acid up to the point of being corrosive. Stomach acid contains hydrochloric acid, in which metallic zinc dissolves readily to give corrosive zinc chloride. Swallowing a post-1982 American one cent piece (97.5% zinc) can cause damage to the stomach lining through the high solubility of the zinc ion in the acidic stomach.\nEvidence shows that people taking 100\u2013300\u00a0mg of zinc daily may suffer induced copper deficiency. A 2007 trial observed that elderly men taking 80\u00a0mg daily were hospitalized for urinary complications more often than those taking a placebo. Levels of 100\u2013300\u00a0mg may interfere with the use of copper and iron or adversely affect cholesterol. Zinc in excess of 500\u00a0ppm in soil interferes with the plant absorption of other essential metals, such as iron and manganese. A condition called the zinc shakes or \"zinc chills\" can be induced by inhalation of zinc fumes while brazing or welding galvanized materials. Zinc is a common ingredient of denture cream which may contain between 17 and 38\u00a0mg of zinc per gram. Disability and even deaths from excessive use of these products have been claimed.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) states that zinc damages nerve receptors in the nose, causing anosmia. Reports of anosmia were also observed in the 1930s when zinc preparations were used in a failed attempt to prevent polio infections. On June 16, 2009, the FDA ordered removal of zinc-based intranasal cold products from store shelves. The FDA said the loss of smell can be life-threatening because people with impaired smell cannot detect leaking gas or smoke, and cannot tell if food has spoiled before they eat it.\nRecent research suggests that the topical antimicrobial zinc pyrithione is a potent heat shock response inducer that may impair genomic integrity with induction of PARP-dependent energy crisis in cultured human keratinocytes and melanocytes.\nPoisoning.\nIn 1982, the US Mint began minting pennies coated in copper but containing primarily zinc. Zinc pennies pose a risk of zinc toxicosis, which can be fatal. One reported case of chronic ingestion of 425 pennies (over 1\u00a0kg of zinc) resulted in death due to gastrointestinal bacterial and fungal sepsis. Another patient who ingested 12\u00a0grams of zinc showed only lethargy and ataxia (gross lack of coordination of muscle movements). Several other cases have been reported of humans suffering zinc intoxication by the ingestion of zinc coins.\nPennies and other small coins are sometimes ingested by dogs, requiring veterinary removal of the foreign objects. The zinc content of some coins can cause zinc toxicity, commonly fatal in dogs through severe hemolytic anemia and liver or kidney damage; vomiting and diarrhea are possible symptoms. Zinc is highly toxic in parrots and poisoning can often be fatal. The consumption of fruit juices stored in galvanized cans has resulted in mass parrot poisonings with zinc.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "34421", "revid": "194203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34421", "title": "Zaire", "text": "Country in Central Africa (1971\u20131997)\nZaire, officially the Republic of Zaire, formerly Republic of the Congo (L\u00e9opoldville) and now called the Democratic Republic of the Congo, was a state in central Africa from 1971 to 1997. It was, by area, the third-largest country in Africa after Sudan and Algeria, and the 11th-largest country in the world from 1965 to 1991. With a population of over 23 million, Zaire was the most populous Francophone country in Africa. Zaire was strategically important to the West during the Cold War, particularly the U.S., as a counterbalance to Soviet influence in Africa. The U.S. and its allies supported the Mobutu Regime (1965\u20131997) with military and economic aid to prevent the spread of communism.\nThe country was a one-party totalitarian military dictatorship, run by Mobutu Sese Seko and his Popular Movement of the Revolution. Zaire was established following Mobutu's seizure of power in a military coup in 1965, after five years of political upheaval following independence from Belgium known as the Congo Crisis. Zaire had a strongly centralist constitution, and foreign assets were nationalized. The period is sometimes referred to as the Second Congolese Republic.\nA wider campaign of , ridding the country of the influences from the colonial era of the Belgian Congo, was also launched under Mobutu's direction. Weakened by the termination of American support after the end of the Cold War, Mobutu was forced to declare a new republic in 1990 to cope with demands for change. By the time of its downfall, Zaire was characterised by widespread cronyism, corruption and economic mismanagement.\nZaire collapsed in the 1990s, amid the destabilization of the eastern parts of the country in the aftermath of the Rwandan genocide and growing ethnic violence. In 1996, , the head of the AFDL militia, led a popular rebellion against Mobutu. With rebel forces making gains westward, Mobutu fled the country, leaving Kabila's forces in charge. In 1997, the country's name was restored to the Democratic Republic of the Congo; Mobutu died less than four months later while in exile in Morocco.\nEtymology.\nThe country's name, , was derived from the name of the Congo River, sometimes called in Portuguese, which in turn was derived from the Kikongo ('river that swallows rivers'). The use of \"Congo\" seems to have replaced \"Zaire\" gradually in English usage during the 18th century and \"Congo\" was the preferred English name in 19th-century literature, although references to \"Zahir\" or \"Zaire\" as the name used by the local population (i.e. derived from Portuguese usage) remained common.\nHistory.\nMobutu.\nIn 1965, as in 1960, the division of power in Congo-L\u00e9opoldville (a former Belgian colony) between President and Parliament led to a stalemate and threatened the country's stability. Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Mobutu again seized power. Unlike the first time, however, Mobutu assumed the presidency, rather than remaining behind the scenes. From 1965, Mobutu dominated the political life of the country, restructuring the state on more than one occasion, and claiming the title of \"Father of the Nation\". He announced the renaming of the country as the Republic of Zaire on 27 October 1971.\nWhen, under the authenticit\u00e9 policy of the early 1970s, Zairians were obliged to adopt \"authentic\" African names rather than European monikers. Mobutu dropped Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 and officially changed his name to \"Mobutu Sese Seko Kuku Ngbendu Wa Za Banga\", or, more commonly, Mobutu S\u00e9s\u00e9 Seko, roughly meaning \"the all-conquering warrior, who goes from triumph to triumph\".\nIn retrospective justification of his 1965 seizure of power, Mobutu later summed up the record of the First Republic as one of \"chaos, disorder, negligence, and incompetence\". Rejection of the legacy of the First Republic went far beyond rhetoric. In the first two years of its existence, the new regime turned to the urgent tasks of political reconstruction and consolidation. Creating a new basis of legitimacy for the state, in the form of a single party, came next in Mobutu's order of priority.\nA third imperative was to expand the reach of the state in the social and political realms, a process that began in 1970 and culminated in the adoption of a new constitution in 1974. By 1976, however, this effort had begun to generate its own inner contradictions, thus paving the way for the resurrection of a Bula Matari (\"the breaker of rocks\") system of repression and brutality.\nConstitutional changes.\nBy 1967, Mobutu had consolidated his rule and proceeded to give the country a new constitution and a single party. The new constitution was submitted to popular referendum in June 1967 and approved by 98 per cent of those voting. It provided that executive powers be centralised in the president, who was to be head of state, head of government, commander in chief of the armed forces and the police, and in charge of foreign policy.\nBut the most far-reaching change was the creation of the Popular Movement of the Revolution (Mouvement Populaire de la R\u00e9volution\u2014MPR) on 17 April 1967, marking the emergence of \"the nation politically organised\". Rather than government institutions being the emanation of the state, the state was henceforth defined as the emanation of the party. Thus, in October 1967, party and administrative responsibilities were merged into a single framework, thereby automatically extending the role of the party to all administrative organs at the central and provincial levels, as well as to the trade unions, youth movements, and student organisations.\nThree years after changing the country's name to Zaire, Mobutu promulgated a new constitution that consolidated his hold on the country. Every five years (seven years after 1978), the MPR elected a president who was simultaneously nominated as the only candidate for president of the republic; he was confirmed in office via a referendum. Under this system, Mobutu was reelected in 1977 and 1984 by implausibly high margins, claiming a unanimous or near-unanimous \"yes\" vote. The MPR was defined as the country's \"single institution,\" and its president was vested with \"plentitude of power exercise.\" Every five years, a single list of MPR candidates was returned to the National Assembly, with official figures showing near-unanimous support. All citizens of Zaire automatically became members of the MPR at birth. For all intents and purposes, this gave the president of the MPR\u2014Mobutu\u2014complete political control over the country.\nTotalitarian expansion.\nTranslating the concept of \"the nation politically organised\" into reality implied a major expansion of state control of civil society. It meant, to begin with, the incorporation of youth groups and worker organisations into the matrix of the MPR. In July 1967, the Political Bureau announced the creation of the Youth of the Popular Revolutionary Movement (Jeunesse du Mouvement Populaire de la R\u00e9volution\u2014JMPR), following the launching a month earlier of the National Union of Zairian Workers (Union Nationale des Travailleurs Za\u00efrois\u2014UNTZA), which brought together into a single organisational framework three preexisting trade unions.\nOstensibly, the aim of the merger, in the terms of the Manifesto of N'Sele, was to transform the role of trade unions from \"being merely a force of confrontation\" into \"an organ of support for government policy\", thus providing \"a communication link between the working class and the state\". Similarly, the JMPR was to act as a major link between the student population and the state. In reality, the government was attempting to bring under its control those sectors where opposition to the regime might be centred. By appointing key labour and youth leaders to the MPR Political Bureau, the regime hoped to harness syndical and student forces to the machinery of the state. Nevertheless, as has been pointed out by numerous observers, there is little evidence that co-optation succeeded in mobilising support for the regime beyond the most superficial level.\nThe trend toward co-optation of key social sectors continued in subsequent years. Women's associations were eventually brought under the control of the party, as was the press, and in December 1971 Mobutu proceeded to emasculate the power of the churches. From then on, only three churches were recognised: the Church of Christ in Zaire (L'\u00c9glise du Christ au Za\u00efre), the Kimbanguist Church, and the Roman Catholic Church.\nNationalisation of the universities of Kinshasa and Kisangani, coupled with Mobutu's insistence on banning all Christian names and establishing JMPR sections in all seminaries, soon brought the Roman Catholic Church and the state into conflict. Not until 1975, and after considerable pressure from the Vatican, did the regime agree to tone down its attacks on the Roman Catholic Church and return some of its control of the school system to the church. Meanwhile, in line with a December 1971 law, which allowed the state to dissolve \"any church or sect that compromises or threatens to compromise public order\", scores of unrecognised religious sects were dissolved and their leaders jailed.\nMobutu was careful also to suppress all institutions that could mobilise ethnic loyalties. Avowedly opposed to ethnicity as a basis for political alignment, he outlawed such ethnic associations as the Association of Lulua Brothers (Association des Lulua Fr\u00e8res), which had been organised in Kasai in 1953 in reaction to the growing political and economic influence in Kasai of the rival Luba people, and Liboke lya Bangala (literally, \"a bundle of Bangala\"), an association formed in the 1950s to represent the interests of Lingala speakers in large cities. It helped Mobutu that his ethnic affiliation was blurred in the public mind. Nevertheless, as dissatisfaction arose, ethnic tensions surfaced again.\nCentralisation of power.\nRunning parallel to the efforts of the state to control all autonomous sources of power, important administrative reforms were introduced in 1967 and 1973 to strengthen the hand of the central authorities in the provinces. The central objective of the 1967 reform was to abolish provincial governments and replace them with state functionaries appointed by Kinshasa. The principle of centralisation was further extended to districts and territories, each headed by administrators appointed by the central government.\nThe only units of government that still retained a fair measure of autonomy\u2014but not for long\u2014were the so-called local collectivities, i.e. chiefdoms and sectors (the latter incorporating several chiefdoms). The unitary, centralised state system thus legislated into existence bore a striking resemblance to its colonial antecedent, except that from July 1972 provinces were called regions.\nWith the January 1973 reform, another major step was taken in the direction of further centralisation. The aim, in essence, was to operate a complete fusion of political and administrative hierarchies by making the head of each administrative unit the president of the local party committee. Furthermore, another consequence of the reform was to severely curtail the power of traditional authorities at the local level. Hereditary claims to authority would no longer be recognised; instead, all chiefs were to be appointed and controlled by the state via the administrative hierarchy. By then, the process of centralisation had theoretically eliminated all preexisting centres of local autonomy.\nThe analogy with the colonial state becomes even more compelling when coupled with the introduction in 1973 of \"obligatory civic work\" (locally known as \"Salongo\" after the Lingala term for work), in the form of one afternoon a week of compulsory labor on agricultural and development projects. Officially described as a revolutionary attempt to return to the values of communalism and solidarity inherent in the traditional society, Salongo was intended to mobilise the population into the performance of collective work \"with enthusiasm and without constraint\".\nIn reality, the conspicuous lack of popular enthusiasm for Salongo led to widespread resistance and foot dragging (causing many local administrators to look the other way). Although failure to comply carried penalties of one month to six months in jail, by the late 1970s most Zairians shirked their Salongo obligations. By resuscitating one of the most bitterly resented features of the colonial state, obligatory civic work contributed in no small way to the erosion of legitimacy suffered by the Mobutist state.\nGrowing conflict.\nIn 1977 and 1978, Katangan rebels based in Angola launched two invasions, Shaba I and Shaba II, into the Katanga Province (renamed \"Shaba\" in 1972). The rebels were driven out with military assistance from the Western Bloc, particularly from the Safari Club.\nThe Battle of Kolwezi, fought in May 1978, resulted in an airborne operation in an aim of rescuing Zairian, Belgian and French miners held as hostages by pro-Communist Katangan guerrillas.\nPope John Paul II made a papal trip to Zaire on 2 May 1980, on the centenary of Catholic evangelization. During his tour, he greeted over a million people, making him the first pontiff to visit Africa as a \"messenger of peace\". He left Zaire four days later on 6 May shortly after 9 people were trampled to death trying to attend mass.\nIn 1981, despite slow progress, Zaire launched an economic reform to revive its economy in order to keep up its rescheduled payment on the country's tremendous debt of $4.4 billion, which had recorded a small rate of economic growth in the last three quarters of 1980.\nDuring the 1980s, Zaire remained a one-party state. Although Mobutu maintained control during this period, opposition parties, most notably the Union for Democracy and Social Progress (Union pour la D\u00e9mocratie et le Progr\u00e8s Social\u2014UDPS), were active. Mobutu's attempts to quell these groups drew significant international criticism.\nAs the Cold War came to a close, internal and external pressures on Mobutu increased. In late 1989 and early 1990, Mobutu was weakened by a series of domestic protests, by heightened international criticism of his regime's human rights practices, by a faltering economy, and by government corruption, most notably his massive embezzlement of government funds for personal use. In June 1989, Mobutu visited Washington, D.C., where he was the first African head of state to be invited for a state meeting with newly elected U.S. President George H. W. Bush.\nIn May 1990, Mobutu agreed to the principle of a multi-party system with elections and a constitution. As details of a reform package were delayed, soldiers began looting Kinshasa in September 1991 to protest their unpaid wages. Two thousand French and Belgian troops, some of whom were flown in on U.S. Air Force planes, arrived to evacuate the 20,000 endangered foreign nationals in Kinshasa.\nIn 1992, after previous similar attempts, the long-promised Sovereign National Conference was staged, encompassing over 2,000 representatives from various political parties. The conference gave itself a legislative mandate and elected Archbishop Laurent Monsengwo Pasinya as its chairman, along with \u00c9tienne Tshisekedi wa Mulumba, leader of the UDPS, as prime minister. By the end of the year Mobutu had created a rival government with its own prime minister. The ensuing stalemate produced a compromise merger of the two governments into the High Council of Republic\u2013Parliament of Transition (HCR\u2013PT) in 1994, with Mobutu as head of state and Kengo wa Dondo as prime minister. Although presidential and legislative elections were scheduled repeatedly over the next 2 years, they never took place.\nFirst Congo War and demise of Zaire.\nBy 1996, tensions from the neighbouring Rwandan Civil War and genocide had spilled over to Zaire (see History of Rwanda). Rwandan Hutu militia forces (Interahamwe), who had fled Rwanda following the ascension of an RPF-led government, had been using Hutu refugee camps in eastern Zaire as bases for incursion against Rwanda. These Hutu militia forces soon allied with the Zairian armed forces (FAZ) to launch a campaign against Congolese ethnic Tutsis in eastern Zaire, known as the Banyamulenge. In turn, these Zairian Tutsis formed a militia to defend themselves against attacks. When the Zairian government began to escalate its massacres in November 1996, the Tutsi militias erupted in rebellion against Mobutu, triggering the First Congo War.\nThe Tutsi militia was soon joined by various opposition groups and supported by several countries, including Rwanda and Uganda. This coalition, led by Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila, became known as the Alliance des Forces D\u00e9mocratiques pour la Lib\u00e9ration du Congo-Za\u00efre (AFDL). The AFDL, now seeking the broader goal of ousting Mobutu, made significant military gains in early 1997, and by the middle of 1997 had almost completely overrun the country. The only thing that seemed to slow the AFDL forces down was the country's ramshackle infrastructure; irregularly used dirt paths and river ports were all that connected some areas to the outside world. Following failed peace talks between Mobutu and Kabila, Mobutu fled into exile in Morocco on 17 May. Kabila named himself president, consolidated power around himself and the AFDL, and marched unopposed into Kinshasa three days later. On 21 May, Kabila officially reverted the name of the country to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nLegacy.\nAfter the collapse of Zaire, its legacy was claimed and partially continued by various factions which emerged from Mobutu's former supporter and loyalist network. These factions were headed by former \"barons\" of the regime as well as Mobutu's family members, and included political parties such as the Union of Mobutist Democrats and the MPR-\"Fait priv\u00e9\". Several of these groups continued to use Zaire's symbols and invoke its traditions. In 2024, opposition politician Christian Malanga led a coup attempt against the Congolese government in the name of his self-proclaimed \"New Zaire\", raising the old flag of Zaire in Kinshasa. The coup attempt was defeated, and Malanga was killed.\nGovernment and politics.\nThe country was governed by the Popular Movement of the Revolution as a one-party state as the only legally permitted party in the country, though the Congo had effectively been a one-party state since the MPR's formation. Despite the constitution nominally allowing for the existence of two parties, the MPR was the only party that was allowed to nominate a candidate for the 1 November 1970 presidential election. Mobutu was confirmed in office by an implausible margin of over 10,131,000 votes against only 157 who voted \"no.\" At parliamentary elections held two weeks later, voters were presented with a single MPR list that was approved with over 99 per cent support.\nThe president served as the head of state of Za\u00efre whose role was to appoint and dismiss cabinet members and determine their areas of responsibility. The ministers, as heads of their respective departments, were to execute the programs and decisions of the president. The president also was to have the power to appoint and dismiss the governors of the provinces and the judges of all courts, including those of the Supreme Court of Justice.\nThe bicameral parliament was replaced by a unicameral legislative body called the Legislative Council. Governors of provinces were no longer elected by provincial assemblies but appointed by the central government. The president had the power to issue autonomous regulations on matters other than those pertaining to the domain of law, without prejudice to other provisions of the constitution. Under certain conditions, the president was empowered to govern by executive order, which carried the force of law.\nMobutism.\nThe doctrinal foundation was disclosed shortly after its birth, in the form of the Manifesto of N'sele, which was issued from the president's rural residence at N'sele, 60\u00a0km further up the Congo River from Kinshasa. In May 1967, it was made public. Nationalism, revolution, and authenticity were identified as the major themes of what came to be known as \"Mobutism\".\nNationalism implied the achievement of economic and political independence. Revolution, described as a \"truly national revolution, essentially pragmatic\", meant \"the repudiation of both capitalism and communism\". Thus, \"neither right nor left\" became one of the legitimising slogans of the regime, along with \"authenticity\".\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Mobutu's government relied on a selected pool of technocrats, often referred to as the \"nomenklatura\", from which the Head of State drew, and periodically rotated, competent individuals. They comprised the Executive Council and led the full spectrum of Ministries, Departments or, as governmental terminology shifted, Commissariats. Among these individuals were internationally respected appointees such as Djamboleka Lona Okitongono who was named Secretary of Finance, under Citizen Namwisi (Minister of Finance), and later became President of OGEDEP, the National Debt Management Office.\nDjamboleka became Governor of the Bank of Zaire in the final stage of Mobutu's government. His progress was fairly typical of the rotational pattern established by Mobutu, who retained the most sensitive ministerial portfolios (such as Defence) for himself.\nAdministrative divisions.\nZaire was divided into 8 regions with its capital Kinshasa. In 1988, the province of Kivu was split into three regions. They were renamed into provinces in 1997.\nEconomy.\nThe za\u00efre was introduced to replace the franc as the new national currency. 100 makuta (singular likuta) equaled one za\u00efre. The likuta was also divided into 100 sengi. However this unit was worth very little, so the smallest coin was for 10 Sengi. The currency and the cities named above had actually already been renamed between 1966 and 1971.\nWhile the country began to stabilize after Mobutu took control, the economic situation began to decline, and by 1979, the purchasing power was only 4% of that in 1960. Starting in 1976 the IMF provided stabilizing loans to his regime. Much of this money was embezzled by Mobutu and his circle.\nAccording to the 1982 report by the IMF's envoy Erwin Blumenthal, it was \"alarmingly clear that the corruptive system in Zaire with all its wicked and ugly manifestations, its mismanagement and fraud will destroy all endeavors of international institutions, of friendly governments, and of the commercial banks towards recovery and rehabilitation of Zaire's economy\". Blumenthal stated that there was \"no chance\" that creditors would ever recover their loans. Yet the IMF and the World Bank continued to lend money that was either embezzled, stolen, or \"wasted on elephant projects\". \"Structural adjustment programmes\" implemented as a condition of IMF loans cut support for health care, education, and infrastructure.\nCulture.\nThe concept of authenticity was derived from the MPR's professed doctrine of \"authentic Zairian nationalism and condemnation of regionalism and tribalism\". Mobutu defined it as being conscious of one's own personality and one's own values and of being at home in one's culture. In line with the dictates of authenticity, the name of the country was changed to the Republic of Zaire on 27 October 1971, and that of the armed forces to Zairian Armed Forces (Forces Arm\u00e9es Za\u00efroises\u2014FAZ).\nThis decision was curious, given that the name \"Congo\", which referred both to the river Congo and to the mediaeval Kongo Empire, was fundamentally authentic to pre-colonial African roots, while \"Zaire\" is in fact a Portuguese corruption of another African word, \"Nzadi\" (\"river\", by Nzadi o Nzere, \"the river that swallows all the other rivers\", another name of the Congo river). General Mobutu became Mobutu S\u00e9s\u00e9 Seko and forced all his citizens to adopt African names and many cities were also renamed.\nSome of the conversions are as follows:\nIn addition, the adoption of Zairian, as opposed to Western or Christian, names in 1972 and the abandonment of Western dress in favour of the wearing of the abacost were subsequently promoted as expressions of authenticity.\nMobutu used the concept of authenticity as a means of vindicating his own brand of leadership. As he himself stated, \"in our African tradition there are never two chiefs\u00a0... That is why we Congolese, in the desire to conform to the traditions of our continent, have resolved to group all the energies of the citizens of our country under the banner of a single national party.\"\nCritics of the regime were quick to point out the shortcomings of Mobutism as a legitimising formula, in particular its self-serving qualities and inherent vagueness; nonetheless, the MPR's ideological training centre, the Makanda Kabobi Institute, took seriously its assigned task of propagating through the land \"the teachings of the Founder-President, which must be given and interpreted in the same fashion throughout the country\". Members of the MPR Political Bureau, meanwhile, were entrusted with the responsibility of serving as \"the repositories and guarantors of Mobutism\".\nQuite aside from the merits or weaknesses of Mobutism, the MPR drew much of its legitimacy from the model of the overarching mass parties that had come into existence in Africa in the 1960s, a model which had also been a source of inspiration for the MNC-Lumumba. It was this Lumumbist heritage which the MPR tried to appropriate in its effort to mobilise the Zairian masses behind its founder-president. Intimately tied up with the doctrine of Mobutism was the vision of an all-encompassing single party reaching out to all sectors of the nation.\nStandards and abbreviations.\nZaire's top-level domain was \".zr\". It has since changed to \".cd\".\nZaire's IOC code was ZAI, which the nation's athletes used at the Olympic Games and other international sporting events like the All-Africa Games. It has since changed to COD.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading and external links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "34422", "revid": "12530063", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34422", "title": "Zirconium", "text": "Chemical element with atomic number 40\nelement with atomic number 40 (Zr)\nZirconium is a chemical element; it has symbol Zr and atomic number 40. First identified in 1789, isolated in impure form in 1824, and manufactured at scale by 1925, pure zirconium is a lustrous transition metal with a greyish-white color that closely resembles hafnium and, to a lesser extent, titanium. It is solid at room temperature, ductile, malleable and corrosion-resistant. The name \"zirconium\" is derived from the name of the mineral zircon, the most important source of zirconium. The word is related to Persian \"zargun\" (zircon; \"zar-gun\", \"gold-like\" or \"as gold\"). Besides zircon, zirconium occurs in over 140 other minerals, including baddeleyite and eudialyte; most zirconium is produced as a byproduct of minerals mined for titanium and tin.\nZirconium forms a variety of inorganic compounds, such as zirconium dioxide, and organometallic compounds, such as zirconocene dichloride. Five isotopes occur naturally, four of which are stable. The metal and its alloys are mainly used as a refractory and opacifier; zirconium alloys are used to clad nuclear fuel rods due to their low neutron absorption and strong resistance to corrosion, and in space vehicles and turbine blades where high heat resistance is necessary. Zirconium also finds uses in flashbulbs, biomedical applications such as dental implants and prosthetics, deodorant, and water purification systems.\nZirconium compounds have no known biological role, though the element is widely distributed in nature and appears in small quantities in biological systems without adverse effects. There is no indication of zirconium as a carcinogen. The main hazards posed by zirconium are flammability in powder form and irritation of the eyes.\nCharacteristics.\n&lt;section begin=properties /&gt;Zirconium is a lustrous, greyish-white, soft, ductile, malleable metal that is solid at room temperature, though it is hard and brittle at lesser purities. In powder form, zirconium is highly flammable, but the solid form is much less prone to ignition. Zirconium is highly resistant to corrosion by alkalis, acids, salt water and other agents. However, it will dissolve in hydrochloric and sulfuric acid, especially when fluorine is present. Alloys with zinc are magnetic at less than 35\u00a0K.&lt;section end=properties /&gt;\nThe melting point of zirconium is 1855\u00a0\u00b0C (3371\u00a0\u00b0F), and the boiling point is 4409\u00a0\u00b0C (7968\u00a0\u00b0F). Zirconium has an electronegativity of 1.33 on the Pauling scale. Of the elements within the d-block with known electronegativities, zirconium has the fourth lowest electronegativity after hafnium, yttrium, and lutetium.\nAt room temperature zirconium exhibits a hexagonally close-packed crystal structure, \u03b1-Zr, which changes to \u03b2-Zr, a body-centered cubic crystal structure, at 863\u00a0\u00b0C. Zirconium exists in the \u03b2-phase until the melting point.\nIsotopes.\nNaturally occurring zirconium is composed of five isotopes. 90Zr, 91Zr, 92Zr, 94Zr, and 96Zr. The first four are stable, while 96 is observed to decay with a half-life of 2.34\u00d71019\u00a0years by double beta emission; this is theoretically possible also for 94Zr. Of these natural isotopes, 90Zr is the most common, making up 51.45% of all zirconium, and 96Zr is the least common, comprising only 2.80%.\nThe artificial radioisotopes of zirconium known range from 77Zr to 114Zr, and 13 nuclear isomers are also listed. The most stable among them is 93Zr, a long-lived fission product, with a half-life of 1.61 million\u00a0years. Radioactive isotopes at or above mass number 93 decay by electron emission resulting in niobium isotopes, whereas those at or below 89 decay by positron emission or electron capture, resulting in yttrium isotopes.\nOccurrence.\nZirconium has a concentration of about 130\u00a0mg/kg within the Earth's crust and about 0.026\u00a0\u03bcg/L in sea water. It is the 18th most abundant element in the crust. It is not found in nature as a native metal, reflecting its intrinsic instability with respect to water. The principal commercial source of zirconium is zircon (ZrSiO4), a silicate mineral, which is found primarily in Australia, Brazil, India, Russia, South Africa and the United States, as well as in smaller deposits around the world. As of 2013, two-thirds of zircon mining occurs in Australia and South Africa. Zircon resources exceed 60 million tonnes worldwide and annual worldwide zirconium production is approximately 900,000 tonnes. Zirconium also occurs in more than 140 other minerals, including the commercially useful ores baddeleyite and eudialyte.\nZirconium is relatively abundant in S-type stars, and has been detected in the sun and in meteorites. Lunar rock samples brought back from several Apollo missions to the moon have a high zirconium oxide content relative to terrestrial rocks.\nEPR spectroscopy has been used in investigations of the unusual 3+ valence state of zirconium. The EPR spectrum of Zr3+, which has been initially observed as a parasitic signal in Fe\u2010doped single crystals of ScPO4, was definitively identified by preparing single crystals of ScPO4 doped with isotopically enriched (94.6%)91Zr. Single crystals of LuPO4 and YPO4 doped with both naturally abundant and isotopically enriched Zr have also been grown and investigated.\nProduction.\nOccurrence.\nZirconium is a by-product formed after mining and processing of the titanium minerals ilmenite and rutile, as well as tin mining. From 2003 to 2007, while prices for the mineral zircon steadily increased from $360 to $840 per tonne, the price for unwrought zirconium metal decreased from $39,900 to $22,700 per ton. Zirconium metal is much more expensive than zircon because the reduction processes are costly.\nCollected from coastal waters, zircon-bearing sand is purified by spiral concentrators to separate lighter materials, which are then returned to the water because they are natural components of beach sand. Using magnetic separation, the titanium ores ilmenite and rutile are removed.\nMost zircon is used directly in commercial applications, but a small percentage is converted to the metal. Most Zr metal is produced by the reduction of the zirconium(IV) chloride with magnesium metal in the Kroll process. The resulting metal is sintered until sufficiently ductile for metalworking.\nSeparation of zirconium and hafnium.\nCommercial zirconium metal typically contains 1\u20133% of hafnium, which is usually not problematic because the chemical properties of hafnium and zirconium are very similar. Their neutron-absorbing properties differ strongly, however, necessitating the separation of hafnium from zirconium for nuclear reactors. Several separation schemes are in use. The liquid-liquid extraction of the thiocyanate-oxide derivatives exploits the fact that the hafnium derivative is slightly more soluble in methyl isobutyl ketone than in water. This method accounts for roughly two-thirds of pure zirconium production, though other methods are being researched; for instance, in India, a TBP-nitrate solvent extraction process is used for the separation of zirconium from other metals. Zr and Hf can also be separated by fractional crystallization of potassium hexafluorozirconate (K2ZrF6), which is less soluble in water than the analogous hafnium derivative. Fractional distillation of the tetrachlorides, also called extractive distillation, is also used.\nVacuum arc melting, combined with the use of hot extruding techniques and supercooled copper hearths, is capable of producing zirconium that has been purified of oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon.\nHafnium must be removed from zirconium for nuclear applications because hafnium has a neutron absorption cross-section 600 times greater than zirconium. The separated hafnium can be used for reactor control rods.\nCompounds.\nLike other transition metals, zirconium forms a wide range of inorganic compounds and coordination complexes. In general, these compounds are colourless diamagnetic solids wherein zirconium has the oxidation state +4. Some organometallic compounds are considered to have Zr(II) oxidation state. Non-equilibrium oxidation states between 0 and 4 have been detected during zirconium oxidation.\nOxides, nitrides, and carbides.\nThe most common oxide is zirconium dioxide, ZrO2, also known as \"zirconia\". This clear to white-coloured solid has exceptional fracture toughness (for a ceramic) and chemical resistance, especially in its cubic form. These properties make zirconia useful as a thermal barrier coating, although it is also a common diamond substitute. Zirconium monoxide, ZrO, is also known and S-type stars are recognised by detection of its emission lines.\nZirconium tungstate has the unusual property of shrinking in all dimensions when heated, whereas most other substances expand when heated. Zirconyl chloride is one of the few water-soluble zirconium complexes, with the formula [Zr4(OH)12(H2O)16]Cl8.\nZirconium carbide and zirconium nitride are refractory solids. Both are highly corrosion-resistant and find uses in high-temperature resistant coatings and cutting tools. Zirconium hydride phases are known to form when zirconium alloys are exposed to large quantities of hydrogen over time; due to the brittleness of zirconium hydrides relative to zirconium alloys, the mitigation of zirconium hydride formation was highly studied during the development of the first commercial nuclear reactors, in which zirconium carbide was a frequently used material.\nLead zirconate titanate (PZT) is the most commonly used piezoelectric material, being used as transducers and actuators in medical and microelectromechanical systems applications.\nHalides and pseudohalides.\nAll four common halides are known, ZrF4, ZrCl4, ZrBr4, and ZrI4. All have polymeric structures and are far less volatile than the corresponding titanium tetrahalides; they find applications in the formation of organic complexes such as zirconocene dichloride. All tend to hydrolyse to give the so-called oxyhalides and dioxides.\nFusion of the tetrahalides with additional metal gives lower zirconium halides (e.g. ZrCl3). These adopt a layered structure, conducting within the layers but not perpendicular thereto. \nThe corresponding tetraalkoxides are also known. Unlike the halides, the alkoxides dissolve in nonpolar solvents. Dihydrogen hexafluorozirconate is used in the metal finishing industry as an etching agent to promote paint adhesion.\nOrganic derivatives.\nOrganozirconium chemistry is key to Ziegler\u2013Natta catalysts, used to produce polypropylene. This application exploits the ability of zirconium to reversibly form bonds to carbon. Zirconocene dibromide ((C5H5)2ZrBr2), reported in 1952 by Birmingham and Wilkinson, was the first organozirconium compound. Schwartz's reagent, prepared in 1970 by P. C. Wailes and H. Weigold, is a metallocene used in organic synthesis for transformations of alkenes and alkynes.\nMany complexes of Zr(II) are derivatives of zirconocene, one example being (C5Me5)2Zr(CO)2.\nHistory.\nThe zirconium-containing mineral zircon and related minerals (jargoon, jacinth, or hyacinth, ligure) were mentioned in biblical writings. The mineral was not known to contain a new element until 1789, when Klaproth analyzed a jargoon from the island of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). He named the new element Zirkonerde (zirconia), related to the Persian \"zargun\" (zircon; \"zar-gun\", \"gold-like\" or \"as gold\"). Humphry Davy attempted to isolate this new element in 1808 through electrolysis, but failed. Zirconium metal was first obtained in an impure form in 1824 by Berzelius by heating a mixture of potassium and potassium zirconium fluoride in an iron tube. \nThe \"crystal bar process\" (also known as the \"Iodide Process\"), discovered by Anton Eduard van Arkel and Jan Hendrik de Boer in 1925, was the first industrial process for the commercial production of metallic zirconium. It involves the formation and subsequent thermal decomposition of zirconium tetraiodide (), and was superseded in 1945 by the much cheaper Kroll process developed by William Justin Kroll, in which zirconium tetrachloride () is reduced by magnesium:\nApplications.\nApproximately 900,000 tonnes of zirconium ores were mined in 1995, mostly as zircon.\nMost zircon is used directly in high-temperature applications. Because it is refractory, hard, and resistant to chemical attack, zircon finds many applications. Its main use is as an opacifier, conferring a white, opaque appearance to ceramic materials. Because of its chemical resistance, zircon is also used in aggressive environments, such as moulds for molten metals.\nZirconium dioxide (ZrO2) is used in laboratory crucibles, in metallurgical furnaces, and as a refractory material Because it is mechanically strong and flexible, it can be sintered into ceramic knives and other blades. Zircon (ZrSiO4) and cubic zirconia (ZrO2) are cut into gemstones for use in jewelry. Zirconium dioxide is a component in some abrasives, such as grinding wheels and sandpaper. Zircon is also used in dating of rocks from about the time of the Earth's formation through the measurement of its inherent radioisotopes, most often uranium and lead.\nA small fraction of the zircon is converted to the metal, which finds various niche applications. Because of zirconium's excellent resistance to corrosion, it is often used as an alloying agent in materials that are exposed to aggressive environments, such as surgical appliances, light filaments, and watch cases. The high reactivity of zirconium with oxygen at high temperatures is exploited in some specialised applications such as explosive primers and as getters in vacuum tubes. Zirconium powder is used as a degassing agent in electron tubes, while zirconium wire and sheets are utilized for grid and anode supports. Burning zirconium was used as a light source in some photographic flashbulbs. Zirconium powder with a mesh size from 10 to 80 is occasionally used in pyrotechnic compositions to generate sparks. The high reactivity of zirconium leads to bright white sparks.\nNuclear applications.\nCladding for nuclear reactor fuels consumes about 1% of the zirconium supply, mainly in the form of zircaloys. The desired properties of these alloys are a low neutron-capture cross-section and resistance to corrosion under normal service conditions. Efficient methods for removing the hafnium impurities were developed to serve this purpose.\nOne disadvantage of zirconium alloys is the reactivity with water, producing hydrogen, leading to degradation of the fuel rod cladding:\nHydrolysis is very slow below 100\u00a0\u00b0C, but rapid at temperature above 900\u00a0\u00b0C. Most metals undergo similar reactions. The redox reaction is relevant to the instability of fuel assemblies at high temperatures. This reaction occurred in the reactors 1, 2 and 3 of the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant (Japan) after the reactor cooling was interrupted by the earthquake and tsunami disaster of March 11, 2011, leading to the Fukushima I nuclear accidents. After venting the hydrogen in the maintenance hall of those three reactors, the mixture of hydrogen with atmospheric oxygen exploded, severely damaging the installations and at least one of the containment buildings.\nZirconium is a constituent of uranium zirconium hydrides, nuclear fuels used in research reactors.\nSpace and aeronautic industries.\nMaterials fabricated from zirconium metal and ZrO2 are used in space vehicles where resistance to heat is needed.\nHigh temperature parts such as combustors, blades, and vanes in jet engines and stationary gas turbines are increasingly being protected by thin ceramic layers and/or paintable coatings, usually composed of a mixture of zirconia and yttria.\nZirconium is also used as a material of first choice for hydrogen peroxide () tanks, propellant lines, valves, and thrusters, in propulsion space systems such as these equipping the Sierra Space's Dream Chaser spaceplane where the thrust is provided by the combustion of kerosene and hydrogen peroxide, a powerful, but unstable, oxidizer. The reason is that zirconium has an excellent corrosion resistance to and, above all, do not catalyse its spontaneous self-decomposition as the ions of many transition metals do.\nMedical uses.\nZirconium-bearing compounds are used in many biomedical applications, including dental implants and crowns, knee and hip replacements, middle-ear ossicular chain reconstruction, and other restorative and prosthetic devices.\nZirconium binds urea, a property that has been utilized extensively to the benefit of patients with chronic kidney disease. For example, zirconium is a primary component of the sorbent column dependent dialysate regeneration and recirculation system known as the REDY system, which was first introduced in 1973. More than 2,000,000 dialysis treatments have been performed using the sorbent column in the REDY system. Although the REDY system was superseded in the 1990s by less expensive alternatives, new sorbent-based dialysis systems are being evaluated and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Renal Solutions developed the DIALISORB technology, a portable, low water dialysis system. Also, developmental versions of a Wearable Artificial Kidney have incorporated sorbent-based technologies.\nSodium zirconium cyclosilicate is used by mouth in the treatment of hyperkalemia. It is a selective sorbent designed to trap potassium ions in preference to other ions throughout the gastrointestinal tract.\nMixtures of monomeric and polymeric Zr4+ and Al3+ complexes with hydroxide, chloride and glycine, called aluminium zirconium glycine salts, are used in a preparation as an antiperspirant in many deodorant products. It has been used since the early 1960s, as it was determined more efficacious as an antiperspirant than contemporary active ingredients such as aluminium chlorohydrate.\nDefunct applications.\nZirconium carbonate (3ZrO2\u00b7CO2\u00b7H2O) was used in lotions to treat poison ivy but was discontinued because it occasionally caused skin reactions.\nSafety.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chembox/styles.css\"/&gt;\nChemical compound\nAlthough zirconium has no known biological role, the human body contains, on average, 250 milligrams of zirconium, and daily intake is approximately 4.15 milligrams (3.5 milligrams from food and 0.65 milligrams from water), depending on dietary habits. Zirconium is widely distributed in nature and is found in all biological systems, for example: 2.86 \u03bcg/g in whole wheat, 3.09 \u03bcg/g in brown rice, 0.55 \u03bcg/g in spinach, 1.23 \u03bcg/g in eggs, and 0.86 \u03bcg/g in ground beef. Further, zirconium is commonly used in commercial products (e.g. deodorant sticks, aerosol antiperspirants) and also in water purification (e.g. control of phosphorus pollution, bacteria- and pyrogen-contaminated water).\nShort-term exposure to zirconium powder can cause irritation, but only contact with the eyes requires medical attention. Persistent exposure to zirconium tetrachloride results in increased mortality in rats and guinea pigs and a decrease of blood hemoglobin and red blood cells in dogs. However, in a study of 20 rats given a standard diet containing ~4% zirconium oxide, there were no adverse effects on growth rate, blood and urine parameters, or mortality. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for zirconium exposure is 5\u00a0mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommended exposure limit (REL) is 5\u00a0mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday and a short term limit of 10\u00a0mg/m3. At levels of 25\u00a0mg/m3, zirconium is immediately dangerous to life and health. However, zirconium is not considered an industrial health hazard. Furthermore, reports of zirconium-related adverse reactions are rare and, in general, rigorous cause-and-effect relationships have not been established. No evidence has been validated that zirconium is carcinogenic or genotoxic.\nAmong the numerous radioactive isotopes of zirconium, 93Zr is among the most common. It is released as a product of nuclear fission of 235U and 239Pu, mainly in nuclear power plants and during nuclear weapons tests in the 1950s and 1960s. It has a very long half-life (1.53 million years), its decay emits only low energy radiations, and it is not considered particularly hazardous.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was initially marketed as the Datsun 240Z for international customers. Since then, Nissan has manufactured seven generations of Z-cars, with the most recent\u2014simply known as the Nissan Z\u2014in production since 2022.\nMain rival cars in the Japanese market included the Toyota Celica, Toyota Supra, Mitsubishi 3000GT and Mazda RX-7.\nThe earlier models of the Nissan Z were built at the Nissan Shatai plant in Hiratsuka until 2000, while the later models (350Z and 370Z) are built at Oppama (2002\u20132004) and Tochigi (2004\u2013present). Known for their looks, reliability, performance and affordability, every Z car has been sold in Japan as the Fairlady Z and elsewhere under the names Nissan Fairlady Z (S30), Nissan Fairlady Z (S130), Nissan 300ZX, Nissan 350Z, Nissan 370Z and Nissan Z.\nHistory.\nNissan was a relatively small automobile manufacturer when it entered the international market in the 1960s and partnered with Yamaha to design a new sports car prototype as an update to the Nissan Fairlady. This effort resulted in the prototype Yamaha YX-30 in 1961. Nissan executives saw the prototype as a halo car that would improve their company's image in the minds of consumers. By 1964, Nissan had realized that Yamaha's DOHC 2.0-liter engine was not meeting Nissan's expectations and the project was scrapped. Yamaha later finished a prototype and took their design to Toyota, resulting in the Toyota 2000GT.\nYutaka Katayama, the president of Nissan USA at the time, realized the importance of making an affordable sports car available internationally. Nissan had already produced the successful series of Fairlady roadsters for many decades that competed mainly with English and Italian roadsters. The product planners envisioned a new line of GT cars that would be stylish, innovative, fast and relatively inexpensive through the use of interchangeable parts with other Nissan vehicles. Nissan also added the engineering background and product development experience of the recently acquired Prince Motor Company, which manufactured the Prince Skyline (renamed Nissan Skyline in 1966).\nFirst generation: Nissan Fairlady Z and Datsun 240Z, 260Z, 280Z.\nSales of the Nissan Z-cars (internally also called S30 or Z29) started in October 1969 (for the 1970 model year), with separate versions for the Japanese and U.S. markets. The Japanese Fairlady Z featured a 2.0L SOHC L20A straight-six engine producing , while the US Datsun 240Z featured a 2.4L L24 inline-6 with twin Hitachi SU-type carburetors that produced (SAE gross horsepower). A third Z, the Z432 (PS30) shared a performance version of the DOHC 2.0\u00a0L S20 engine with the Nissan Skyline 2000 GT-R.\nIn Japan, the Z was still known as the Fairlady to keep the car in line with the previous generation Datsun Sports roadster. Japanese domestic market (JDM) versions had the Fairlady Z badge on the lower fenders with the 432 badge above (the 432 designation was 4 valves, 3 carburetors, and 2 camshafts). However, Yutaka Katayama ensured the American version had all Nissan, Fairlady Z, and 432 badging replaced with \"Datsun\" and prevented all dealer shipments until they were replaced.\nThe 240Z was released in America on October 22, 1969. It sold over 45,000 units through the '71 model year and over 50,000 and 40,000 in 1972 and 1973, respectively.\nThe 260Z was released in 1974. Engine displacement increased to 2.6 L, and Nissan introduced a 2+2 model option with a 30\u00a0cm (1 foot) stretched wheelbase and length. Engine power increased to , except for most areas of the U.S., where power decreased to (SAE net horsepower) due to new camshafts, carburetors, and lower compression, that were introduced to comply with new US emissions regulations.\nThe 280Z was released in 1975 for North America only (not to be confused with the second-generation \"280ZX\") and featured a further engine displacement increase, to 2.8 L. A\u00a0major change was the introduction of Bosch fuel injection, replacing the previous SU carburetors. This resulted in a power increase to (SAE gross horsepower), offsetting increased weight from added luxury features and an enlarged bumper that met US Federal regulations. Export markets outside North America however kept receiving the Datsun 260Z, until the introduction of the Datsun 280ZX in late 1978.\nSecond generation: Nissan Fairlady 280ZX (S130/Z30).\nKnown as the Datsun/Nissan 280ZX in export markets, the car continued to use the \"Fairlady\" moniker in the Japanese domestic market where 2-litre inline-six engines were also available and were first introduced in 1978. That same year, main rival Toyota introduced the Supra as its answer to the new Fairlady, although it also continued to produce the Celica that it was based on.\nThe only thing left unchanged from the previous 280Z was the 5-speed manual transmission and 2.8-liter L28 inline-6 engine, while the entire car overall was made more luxurious to meet growing consumer demands. Major changes for this new generation of Z-cars include t-tops, introduced in 1980, and a turbocharged model introduced in 1981, complementing the naturally aspirated (NA) 2-seater and NA 2+2 models. Coupled with either a 3-speed automatic or 5-speed manual transmission, the turbocharged model was capable of and of torque, over the and of the NA engine.\nNotable models include the 10th Anniversary Edition, featuring gold emblems, gold alloy wheels, and two-toned paint in either gold/red and black, with luxury features such as leather seats, headlamp washers, and automatic climate control.\nThe 280ZX was wildly popular, being hailed as \"Motor Trend\"'s Import Car of the Year for 1979 and going on to set a Z-car sales record of 86,007 units in its first year. While on the one hand, it received praise for taking the Z-car to further levels of comfort and performance, many enthusiasts also lamented the further emphasis on luxury over driving fun. This would continue with the third generation of the Z-car, with a clean-sheet redesign.\nThird generation: Nissan 300ZX (Z31, First model).\nThe Z-car was completely redesigned in 1984 and introduced Nissan's new series of 3.0-liter V6 engine, dubbed the VG series. The same engine was used in the electromotive (later to become NPTI) GTP ZX-Turbo that dominated the IMSA GTP races in 1988 and 1989. These were available in both VG30E naturally aspirated and VG30ET turbocharged forms producing 160 and 200 bhp (120 and 150\u00a0kW) respectively, although some VG30ET powered Z-cars exported outside of the U.S. produced due to a longer cam duration and fewer emission restrictions. These were showcased in sleek new wedge-shaped styling and given a new name, the 300ZX. Like its predecessor, it proved to be wildly popular and was the second best-selling Z-car in history selling over 70,000 units due in part not only to its new styling but also to even more added luxury features and high performance. When the 300ZX Turbo was released in Japan, it offered the highest HP available in a Japanese standard production car at the time.\nMuch like the 280ZX that preceded it, the first gen 300ZX was thought by enthusiasts as more GT than a true sports car. It had improved handling, acceleration, and refinement than any previous model Z-car.\nNissan made various changes and claimed improvements to the Z31 model throughout its entire production. In 1983, Nissan first offered the 300ZX in Japan. It was introduced in the US one year later. All US-market 1984 model Nissan vehicles carried both Datsun and Nissan nameplates. Along with the arrival of their new flagship sports coupe, Nissan launched an aggressive marketing campaign to promote the brand name change from Datsun to Nissan. The 1984 Model can technically be considered the only year of the \"Datsun 300ZX\". The 1984 300ZX 50th Anniversary Edition was released in celebration of the company's 50th anniversary year. It was based on the standard 300ZX Turbo but was outfitted with every luxury feature available, a unique black interior with \"body sonic\" leather seats in addition to widened fender flares, requisite badging, rear quarter panel flares, and sixteen-inch (406 mm) wheels (400 mm).\nFor the 1985 model year, Nissan dropped the Datsun name brand for good, but the car dealers were still known as Datsun dealers. Paul Newman raced in the 1985 GT1 Challenge and won. This was Newman's fourth national championship. Minor changes were made to the 300ZX including a water-cooled turbocharger and smoked taillights.\nThe 1986 model saw wider flared wheel wells, as well as body-color bumpers, and the rear quarter panels, were designed specifically to accommodate factory ground effect style side skirts. 1986 turbo models were equipped with an ordinary hood, markedly losing the turbo \"scoop\" on the driver's side.\nTo keep up with quickly aging aesthetics, another slight redesign happened in 1987, consisting of new rounded, restyled, and longer front and rear bumpers, new headlights, and new taillights. The black trim on turbo models was now charcoal instead of gloss black, and 1987 Turbo models came with special \"smoked\" turbo-finned wheels. All 1987 model year turbo cars also received an upgraded manual transmission, and larger and more powerful brakes, and turbo cars produced from 4/87 and later came equipped with a clutch-type limited-slip differential.\nFor the 1988 models, there were again a few small changes. The turbocharger was switched from the Garrett T3 turbo to a lower-inertia T25 turbo, and the engine was from 7.8:1 to an 8.3:1 compression ratio to reduce turbocharger spool time and provide an instant boost at any usable RPM. The interior aluminum accents and chrome door handles that adorned the earlier cars were dropped in favor of matching color parts. Another special edition, the \"Shiro Special\" (SS), was released in 1988. It was only available in pearl white (\"Shiro\" meaning \"white\" in Japanese). The SS package consisted of analog gauges and climate controls with a black interior, stiffer sway bars, stiffer springs, non-adjustable suspension, special seats (Recaro), a viscous-coupling limited slip differential, and a special front lower lip spoiler. This package had no options; all 88SS cars are identical.\nThe 1989 Models are identical to 1988 models, though somewhat rare because Nissan winding-down production early in preparation for the second generation 300ZX. \nFourth generation: Nissan 300ZX (Z32, Second model).\nThe only thing unchanged from the previous generation 300ZX is the 3.0-liter V6 engine, now with dual overhead camshafts (DOHC), variable valve timing (VVT) and producing a rated and naturally aspirated. The turbo variant was upgraded with twin Garrett turbochargers and dual intercoolers. This produced with of torque. 0-60 times of 5.0-6.0 seconds were reported, and it had a governed top speed of .\nUpon its release, the 300ZX won \"Motor Trend\"'s \"Import Car of the Year\" in 1990 as well as \"One of the Top Ten Performance Cars\". Automobile Magazine honored the 300ZX/300ZX Turbo as its \"Design of the Year\" and added it to their \"All Stars\" list. Road &amp; Track named the 300ZX Turbo \"One of the Ten Best Cars in the World\", and \"Car and Driver\" added it to their 10Best for the seven years in which it was in production in America. American Z-car sales reached 1 million in 1990.\nNissan utilized the Cray-II supercomputer to completely design the new 300ZX with the form of CAD software. This made the 300ZX one of the first production cars to be developed in a CAD program. In return, it featured a whole host of technological advancements. On the twin turbo models, four-wheel steering was available under the name Super HICAS \"(High Capacity Actively Controlled Steering)\". The twin turbochargers, intercoolers, and requisite plumbing were left for a cramped engine bay; however, everything fit perfectly.\nLike previous generations, Nissan offered a 2+2 model with the Z32. In 1993, a convertible version was introduced in the Z-car's history, as a response to aftermarket conversions. All 300ZXs now featured T-tops as standard, yet there were some rare hardtops (known as \"slick tops\") produced as well.\nThe 300ZX was doomed to the same fate as many Japanese sports cars of the time. The mid-'90s trend toward SUVs and the rising Yen:Dollar ratio were both influential in ending North American 300ZX sales in 1996 at over 80,000 units sold (production for other markets continued until 2000). Probably the biggest killer of the 300ZX was its ever-inflating price; at its release it was priced at about $30,000, but in its final year this price had increased to around $50,000. This left many people questioning its value, and despite a final Commemorative Edition of the final 300 units shipped to America (complete with decals and certificates of authenticity), the Z-Car was on hiatus. In Japan, however, the 300ZX lived on for a few more years with a face-lift including a new front fascia, tail lights, headlights, rear spoiler, and a few other minor changes.\nNissan 240Z Concept (1999).\nIn the U.S., the Z-car went on hiatus from 1997 to 2002, as Nissan focused more on SUVs and was also in some financial trouble. To keep Z-car interest alive, Nissan launched a restoration program in 1998 for which they purchased original 240Zs, professionally restored them, and re-sold them at dealerships for about $24,000.\nNissan next launched a concept car at the 1999 North American International Auto Show, the 240Z Concept. A throwback to the original, it was a bright orange two-seater with classic swept-back styling. In addition, it was fully functional, with the 2.4-liter 4-cylinder KA24DE engine from the 240SX featuring and of torque. The designers used an original 240Z to inspire and the concept was created in only 12 weeks.\nThe running concept, featuring a 4-cylinder engine compared to the Z-car's traditional 6-cylinder engine, was eventually thought less than a worthy successor to the line.\nFifth generation: Nissan 350Z (Z33).\nIn 1999, the French company Renault bought 44.4% of Nissan and Carlos Ghosn became its chief operating officer, but it would not be until 2001 when Ghosn became CEO that he would tell reporters: \"We will build the \"Z\". And we will make it profitable.\"\nOn January 8, 2001, Nissan introduced the Z Concept. Much like the previous Z concept, it debuted at the North American International Auto Show and was painted bright orange. The squat, long-hood/short-deck styling resulted from a competition between Nissan's Japanese, European, and American design studios, with the La Jolla, California studio's design being chosen in March 2000. The product planners hoped to avoid the price problems that plagued the last few years of the 300ZX with a target MSRP of $30,000 while using the Porsche Boxster as a benchmark.\nIn the summer of 2002, the 350Z was released to wide acclaim. It employed a slightly improved version of the 3.5-liter VQ35DE DOHC V6 engine found in multiple Nissan cars at the time, including the Skyline and Pathfinder. Released in July 2002 in Japan at reorganized Nissan Japanese dealerships called \"Nissan Blue Stage\", and on August 20, 2002, in the U.S., the 350Z coup\u00e9 was available in 5 trim packages: '350Z' (Base), 'Enthusiast', 'Performance', 'Touring', and 'Track' editions. In Europe, only the 'Track' trim was available, although it was badged and marketed as '350Z'. This engine initially produced and torque, but in 2005 was increased to and . Prices started at $26,000 US, well below the $30,000 mark initially set forth by Nissan. Coupled with either a 6-speed manual gearbox or a 5-speed automatic (the automatic lost in comparison), it was initially available only as a 2-seater hardtop. A convertible model was later introduced in 2004.\nThe 350Z was available in a selection of seven trim packages, depending on the year: \"Base\", \"Enthusiast\", \"Performance\", \"Touring\", \"Grand Touring\", \"Track\" and \"Nismo\". The base model 350Z, in comparison to the more expensive packages, did not have a limited-slip differential or a traction control system. Touring and Grand Touring models both featured leather seats, Bose entertainment systems, optional satellite navigation, VDC (vehicle dynamic control), and other user conveniences, while the Grand Touring models also added Rays Engineering forged wheels and the Brembo braking system found on the Track and Nismo models. In 2007, Nissan dropped the \"Track\" version in favor of the \"Nismo\" edition, but retained the Brembo brakes, Rays Engineering wheels, and simple interior, but added a larger exhaust and aggressive body kit. The second Nismo edition, released in 2007, included revised camshafts, a Nismo sport-tuned exhaust, custom Rays Engineering wheels ( in rear), front and rear spoilers and rear diffuser, and a Brembo braking system with four-piston front and two-piston rear calipers (with front and rear rotors).\nThe 2005 35th Anniversary Edition and 2006 350Z were equipped with manual transmissions and received a newly revised engine, which increased the redline to 7,000 rpm and increased power to .\n2007-2008 models came with the 3.5L VQ35HR engine with dual intakes and a 7,500 rpm redline, which produced a power output of , and featured a more linear powerband in addition to the increased torque at lower revolutions. It is widely believed that this model year (2007\u201308) is the most desired among enthusiasts due to the car featuring a revised transmission (CD009) which solved all previous issues and the new engine architecture (VQ35HR) which provided an overall faster car.\nSixth generation: Nissan 370Z (Z34).\nOn December 30, 2008, the 370Z was introduced as a 2009 model. In June 2009, the second generation 2009 Nismo 370Z debuted. This was followed by the introduction of the 2010 370Z Roadster in late summer of 2009.\nThe 370Z (Z34) is powered by Nissan's 3.7 liter V6 engine, the VQ37VHR. The power output ranges from , with peak torque of , depending on market and variant. The 370Z has an official time of 5.1 seconds. However, the car has also been tested by Motor Trend Magazine, which reported a 4.7 second with of rollout. Quarter mile times range from 13.1 and 13.6 seconds, thus making the 370Z the fastest production Z. The 370Z is available with either a six-speed manual gearbox or a seven-speed automatic with paddle shifters. The six-speed manual is the first production car manual gearbox to feature a system that Nissan refers to as \"SynchroRev Match\", which automatically blips the throttle to match engine and transmission speed during downshifts, thus achieving the same effect as the heel-and-toe downshift technique.\nSeventh generation: Nissan Z (RZ34).\nThe seventh-generation Nissan Z was first hinted at in 2018, when Alfonso Albaisa, senior vice president for global design at Nissan, confirmed to Australian automotive magazine \"WhichCar\" that a successor to the Nissan 370Z was being developed. On March 19, 2020, Nissan filed a trademark for two new logos: one was its new corporate logo, while the other was a new version of the Z-car logo, further confirming the existence of a new Z-car. Then, on May 28, 2020, as part of its global restructuring plan, named \"Nissan Next\", Nissan's official YouTube channel released a one-minute, twelve-second video showcasing its updated vehicle lineup, including the new Z-car; this video also confirmed the claim that the new Z-car would have retro styling, with its overall shape and circular running lights referencing the 240Z. On September 15, 2020, Nissan revealed the prototype version called the \"Nissan Z Proto\". The prototype is long, which is longer than the current Nissan Z car, the 370Z, and no wider. The production 2023 Nissan Z was revealed on August 17, 2021, in New York City. Debuting as a 2023 model, the Nissan Z is the brand's first Z car without a number in the model name (which in the past had reflected the displacement of the engine). On August 18, 2021, Nissan confirmed that the new Z would not carry the Z35 chassis code but instead the RZ34 chassis code.\nEngines.\nThe first two generations, S30 (240Z/260Z/280Z) and S130 (280ZX) of Z-car were powered by a straight-six engine, (part of the L-series of Nissan engines, which powered most of their vehicles until the early 1980s) with a displacement of 2.4\u00a0 L in the first incarnation, and increasing to 2.6\u00a0 L and 2.8\u00a0 L in the 260Z, and the 280Z and ZX, respectively. The Nissan S130 Model was capable of a top speed of , and the S30, despite having the same engine, boasted a lesser top speed of .\nThe second generation S130, introduced in 1979 was a complete redesign, retaining only the L28 engine and other driveline components. A turbo option was introduced in 1981, bringing performance surpassing that of the original 240Z.\nThe third generation, the 300ZX, switched to a 3.0\u00a0L V6. There were two generations of the 300ZX: the Z31 from 1984 to 1989, and the Z32 from 1990 to 1996. Both the Z31 and Z32 came in either non-turbo or turbo trims. During the '90s, the car's price continued to elevate and sales continued to fall. Even a major design change in 1998 couldn't save it, and production finally ended in 1999. This generation had a top speed of .\nWhile the model names were based on the engine capacity for the US markets, with the 240Z having a 2.4-liter L24 engine and the 260Z having a 2.6-liter L26 engine and so on to the 300ZX 3.0-litre V6, due to Japanese taxation laws relating to engine capacity, some second and third generation (S130 and Z31) Fairlady Z cars were produced for the Japanese domestic market fitted with 2.0L engines. The S130 was available with an L20ET inline 6, while the Z31 had either a RB20DET inline 6 or a VG30DET V6.\nIn the 2003 model year, Nissan reentered the US sports-car market with the 350Z, powered by the 3.5\u00a0L VQ35DE V6 producing , and styled in an attempt to create a more modern interpretation of the 240Z's lines. It had a new six-speed manual gearbox, and is capable of over . The 350Z's engine was updated twice; in 2005 to the VQ35DE RevUp, producing , and in 2007 to the VQ35HR, producing .\nThe 370Z features a 3.7L VQ37VHR V6 producing . This engine shares much of its architecture with the VQ35HR, the primary differences being the introduction of Nissan's VVEL (Variable Valve Event and Lift) and an increase in overall displacement. Due to the similarities between the two engines, many OEM and aftermarket parts are interchangeable. The new 370Z, like the previous two generations, is electronically limited to .\nThe seventh generation Z is powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.0L VR30DDTT V6 producing and 350 lb-ft of torque mated to a six speed manual transmission complete with an Exedy clutch or a nine-speed automatic Jatco transmission.\nRacing.\n[[File:Datsun280ZXrace.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Don Devendorf and [[Tony Adamowicz]] drove a [[Nissan 280ZX|280ZX Turbo]] to the 1983 IMSA GTO Championship.]]The 280ZX proved successful in various classes of racing, particularly in the US. Significant results include:\n[[File:Cunningham 300ZX.jpg|thumb|200px|The Clayton Cunningham Racing [[300ZX]] which won the 1994 [[24 Hours of Daytona]].]]\n[[File:Xanavi Nissan 350Z.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Xanavi Nissan 350Z GT at the 2006 British International Motor Show]]\n[[File:Xanavi Nissan 350Z rear.jpg|thumb|right|Xanavi 350Z, rear]]\nThe first generation Zs ([[Nissan S30|240Z/260Z/280Z]]) proved to be very successful in many forms of racing. The S30s won many SCCA/IMSA championships and even became quite successful in rally and baja races.\nThe 1983 Electramotive [[280ZX|280ZX Turbo]] produced over , and reached a terminal speed of in the standing quarter mile.\nThe most notable driver to be associated with the car was actor [[Paul Newman]], who raced with the Bob Sharp Racing team. He also helped to promote the car, even by starring in a series of commercials.\nIn 1984 to 1985 showroom stock racing, the [[300ZX]] captured wins on numerous occasions. The car scored its only Trans Am win in 1986 at [[Lime Rock Park|Lime Rock]] by [[Paul Newman]] for Bob Sharp Racing.\nFrom 1985 to 1987, the Electramotive-developed [[Nissan GTP ZX-Turbo|GTP ZX-Turbo]] was raced in the [[IMSA GT Championship]]'s GTP class and also the [[All Japan Sports Prototype Championship]], badged as a Fairlady Z, using a Lola T810 chassis and a [[Nissan VG engine|VG30ET]] engine. Following development through 1987, the car would become dominant in IMSA GT in 1988. Additional factory endorsement, combined with a new chassis, transmission and more reliable Goodyear tires contributed to the team's success. The SOHC [[Nissan VG engine|VG30ET]] was making upwards of , with a [[power band]] that extended from 4000 to 9000 rpm on a single turbo. From 1990 to 1995, [[Steve Millen]] drove the twin-turbo 300ZX for Clayton Cunningham Racing. The car dominated the IMSA in its GTO, then later GTS categories due to its newly designed chassis and engine. Millen would rank as the #1 Factory Driver for Nissan for 7 years and earn two IMSA GTS Driving Championships and two IMSA GTS Manufacturer's Championships. Among enthusiasts and the team themselves, the biggest triumph for the race Z32 was the victory in the [[24 Hours of Daytona]]. In the same year at the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], the 300ZX ranked first in the GTS-1 class and 5th overall. In an attempt to level the playing field in the GTS-1 class by reducing the allowable horsepower, the IMSA declared the twin turbo [[Nissan VG engine|VG engine]] ineligible. The 1995 GTS 300ZX car would debut with the [[V8 engine|V8]] [[Nissan VH engine]] at Daytona and would place first in the GTS-1 class at the [[12 Hours of Sebring]] and Mosehead Grand Prix in Halifax.\nThe JUN-BLITZ Bonneville Z32 holds the E/BMS class land speed record of set at the 1995 Bonneville Speed Trial. The vehicle was built as a partnership between [[JUN Auto]] and BLITZ. This record remains unbroken. In 1990, JUN's first Z32 went 339.2\u00a0km/h at their Yatabe test course and hit 373\u00a0km/h after some tuning at Bonneville.\nThe 350Z replaced the [[Nissan Skyline GT-R|Skyline GT-R]] and [[Nissan Silvia|Silvia]] as the car for Nissan's factory and customer teams in the [[Super GT|JGTC/Super GT]]'s GT500 class and GT300 class respectively. The GT500 cars used were heavily modified and featured a longer nose and tail (requiring the production of the Type-E [[Homologation (motorsport)|homologation]] special), carbon fiber bodywork, and a tube chassis. In 2004, [[Nismo]] won the GT500 championship. Until the 2007 season, the car was powered by a [[Nissan VQ engine#VQ30DETT|VQ30DETT]] V6. In order to increase competitiveness, however, a new 4.5L [[V8 engine|V8]] powerplant has been developed. The 350Z, with slightly more pedestrian modifications also competes in the GT300 class (having started there even before the Skyline GT-Rs were replaced) by teams such as Endless Sports and Mola. In 2003 Hasemi Sports won the GT300 championship with the 350Z. In 2008 season, the 350Zs were all replaced by [[Nissan GT-R]]s in the GT500 class, but they have continued to be used in the GT300 class as the GT-Rs exceed the horsepower limits which make it impossible to participate. Thus, two 350Zs competed in the series and MOLA won both Drivers' and Teams' championships in the GT300 class. Two years later, Hasemi Sports won the 2010 GT300 title again before its team's withdrawal of the series in the following season, as another 350Z team MOLA also moved up to GT500 class earlier in the preseason time, it marked the first full absence of Nissan vehicles in GT300 class since the establishment of JGTC in 1994.\nThe Z33 is also popular in import drag racing; one fielded by Performance Motorsport in the NHRA Sports Compact series, with twin turbo claims to put out over 1,700\u00a0bhp (1,268\u00a0kW; 1,724 PS) and achieved 8.33 quarter mile time with its best speed of .

{"id": "34425", "revid": "50584560", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34425", "title": "Z", "text": "Twenty-sixth letter of the Latin alphabet\nZ, or z, is the twenty-sixth and last letter of the Latin alphabet. It is used in the modern English alphabet, in the alphabets of other Western European languages, and in others worldwide. Its usual names in English are \"zed\" (), which is most commonly used in British English, and \"zee\" (), most commonly used in American English, with an occasional archaic variant \"izzard\" ().\nName.\nIn most English-speaking countries, including Australia, Canada, India, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa and the United Kingdom, the letter's name is \"zed\" , reflecting its derivation from the Greek letter \"zeta\" (this dates to Latin, which borrowed Y and Z from Greek), but in American English its name is \"zee\" , analogous to the names for B, C, D, etc., and deriving from a late 17th-century English dialectal form.\nAnother English dialectal form is \"izzard\" . This dates from the mid-18th century and probably derives from Occitan or the French , whose reconstructed Latin form would be \"*idz\u0113ta\", perhaps a Vulgar Latin form with a prosthetic vowel. Outside of the anglosphere, its variants are still used in Hong Kong English and Cantonese.\nOther languages spell the letter's name in a similar way: in Italian, Basque, and Spanish, in Icelandic (no longer part of its alphabet but found in personal names), in Portuguese, in Swedish, in Danish, in Dutch, Indonesian, Polish, Romanian, and Czech, in German (capitalized as a noun), in Norwegian, in French, in Japanese, and in Vietnamese (not part of its alphabet). Several languages render it as or , e.g. or more rarely in Finnish (sometimes dropping the first \"t\" altogether; , or the latter of which is not very commonplace). In Standard Chinese pinyin, the name of the letter Z is pronounced , as in \"zi\", although the English \"zed\" and \"zee\" have become very common. In Esperanto the name of the letter Z is pronounced .\nHistory.\nSemitic.\nThe Semitic symbol was the seventh letter, named \"zayin\", which meant \"weapon\" or \"sword\". It represented either the sound as in English and French, or possibly more like (as in Italian ', ').\nGreek.\nThe Greek form of Z was a close copy of the Phoenician Zayin (), and the Greek inscriptional form remained in this shape throughout ancient times. The Greeks called it \"zeta\", a new name made in imitation of \"eta\" (\u03b7) and \"theta\" (\u03b8).\nIn earlier Greek of Athens and Northwest Greece, the letter seems to have represented ; in Attic, from the 4th century BC onwards, it seems to have stood for and \u2013 there is no consensus concerning this issue. In other dialects, such as Elean and Cretan, the symbol seems to have been used for sounds resembling the English voiced and voiceless \"th\" (IPA and , respectively). In the common dialect (koine) that succeeded the older dialects, \u03b6 became , as it remains in modern Greek.\nEtruscan.\nThe Etruscan letter \"Z\" was derived from the Phoenician alphabet, most probably through the Greek alphabet used on the island of Ischia. In Etruscan, this letter may have represented .\nLatin.\nThe letter \"Z\" existed in more archaic versions of Latin, but at c.\u2009300 BC, Appius Claudius Caecus, the Roman censor, removed the letter Z from the alphabet, because the appearance while pronouncing it imitated a grinning skull. A more likely explanation is that the sound that it probably represented had disappeared from Latin after turning into due to a rhotacism process, making the letter useless for spelling Latin words. Whatever the case may be, Appius Claudius's distaste for the letter Z is today credited as the reason for its removal. A few centuries later, after the Roman Conquest of Greece, Z was again borrowed to spell words from the prestigious Attic dialect of Greek.\nBefore the reintroduction of \"z\", the sound of zeta was written \"s\" at the beginning of words and \"ss\" in the middle of words, as in ' for \"belt\" and ' for \"banker\".\nIn some inscriptions, \"z\" represented a Vulgar Latin sound, likely an affricate, formed by the merging of the reflexes of Classical Latin , and :[] for example, ' for ' \"January\", ' for ' \"deacon\", and ' for ' \"today\". Likewise, sometimes replaced in words like ' for ' \"to baptize\". In modern Italian, \"z\" represents or , whereas the reflexes of ' and ' are written with the letter \"g\" (representing when before \"i\" and \"e\"): ', '. In other languages, such as Spanish, further evolution of the sound occurred.\nOld English.\nOld English used \"S\" alone for both the unvoiced and the voiced sibilant. The Latin sound imported through French was new and was not written with \"Z\" but with \"G\" or \"I\". The successive changes can be seen in the doublet forms \"jealous\" and \"zealous\". Both of these come from a late Latin ', derived from the imported Greek '. The earlier form is \"jealous\"; its initial sound is the , which developed to Modern French . John Wycliffe wrote the word as or .\n\"Z\" at the end of a word was pronounced \"ts\", as in English \"assets\", from Old French ' \"enough\" (Modern French '), from Vulgar Latin \"\" (\"to sufficiency\").\nLast letter of the alphabet.\nIn earlier times, the English alphabets used by children terminated not with \"Z\" but with \"&amp;\" or related typographic symbols.\nSome Latin based alphabets have extra letters on the end of the alphabet. The last letter for the Icelandic, Finnish and Swedish alphabets is \u00d6, while it is \u00c5 for Danish and Norwegian. The German alphabet ends with \"Z\", as the umlauts (\"\u00c4/\u00e4\", \"\u00d6/\u00f6\", and \"\u00dc/\u00fc\") and the letter \"\u00df\" ( or ) are regarded respectively as modifications of the vowels \"a/o/u\" and as a (standardized) variant spelling of \"ss\", not as independent letters, so they come after the unmodified letters in the alphabetical order.\nTypographic variants.\nThe variant with a stroke \u27e8\u01b5\u01b6\u27e9 and the lower-case tailed Z \u27e8\u0292\u27e9, though distinct characters, can also be considered to be allographs of \u27e8Z\u27e9/\u27e8z\u27e9.\nTailed Z (German ', also ') originated in the medieval Gothic minuscules and the Early Modern Blackletter typefaces. In some Antiqua typefaces, this letter is present as a standalone letter or in ligatures. Ligated with long s (\u017f), it is part of the origin of the Eszett (\u00df) in the German alphabet. The character came to be indistinguishable from the yogh (\u021d) in Middle English writing, leading to the apparently anomalous pronunciation of the surname \"Menzies\". \nUnicode assigns codepoints and in the Letterlike Symbols and Mathematical alphanumeric symbols ranges respectively.\nUse in writing systems.\nEnglish.\nIn modern English orthography, the letter \u27e8z\u27e9 usually represents the sound .\nIt represents in words like \"seizure\". More often, this sound appears as \u27e8su\u27e9 or \u27e8si\u27e9 in words such as \"measure\", \"decision\", etc. In all these words, developed from earlier by \"yod\"-coalescence.\nFew words in the Basic English vocabulary begin or end with \u27e8z\u27e9, though it occurs within other words. It is the least frequently used letter in written English, with a frequency of about 0.08% in words.\n\u27e8z\u27e9 is more common in the Oxford spelling of British English than in standard British English, as this variant prefers the more etymologically 'correct' \"-ize\" endings, which are closer to Greek, to \"-ise\" endings, which are closer to French; however, \"-yse\" is preferred over \"-yze\" in Oxford spelling, as it is closer to the original Greek roots of words like \"analyse\". The most common variety of English it is used in is American English, which prefers both the \"-ize\" and \"-yze\" endings. One native Germanic English word that contains 'z', \"freeze\" (past \"froze\", participle \"frozen\") came to be spelled that way by convention, even though it could have been spelled with 's' (as with \"choose\", \"chose\" and \"chosen\").\n\u27e8z\u27e9 is used in writing to represent the act of sleeping (often using multiple z's, like \"zzzz\"), as an onomatopoeia for the sound of closed-mouth human snoring.\nOther languages.\n\u27e8z\u27e9 stands for a voiced alveolar or voiced dental sibilant , in Albanian, Breton, Czech, Dutch, French, Hungarian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Romanian, Serbo-Croatian, and Slovak. It stands for in Chinese pinyin and Jyutping, Finnish (occurs in loanwords only), and German, and is likewise expressed in Old Norse. In Italian, it represents two phonemes, and . In Portuguese, it stands for in most cases, but also for or (depending on the regional variant) at the end of syllables. In Basque, it represents the sound .\nCastilian Spanish uses the letter to represent (as English \u27e8th\u27e9 in \"thing\"), though in other dialects (Latin American, Andalusian) this sound has merged with . Before voiced consonants, the sound is voiced to or , sometimes debbucalized to (as in the surname \"Guzm\u00e1n\" , or ). This is the only context in which \u27e8z\u27e9 can represent a voiced sibilant in Spanish, though \u27e8s\u27e9 also represents (or , depending on the dialect) in this environment.\nIn Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish, \u27e8z\u27e9 usually stands for the sound /s/ and thus shares the value of \u27e8s\u27e9; it normally occurs only in loanwords that are spelt with \u27e8z\u27e9 in the source languages.\nThe letter \u27e8z\u27e9 on its own represents in Polish. It is also used in four of the seven officially recognized digraphs: \u27e8cz\u27e9 (), \u27e8dz\u27e9 (), \u27e8rz\u27e9 ( or ) and \u27e8sz\u27e9 (), and is one of the most frequently used of the consonant letters in that language. (Other Slavic languages avoid digraphs and mark the corresponding phonemes with the (caron) diacritic: \u27e8\u010d\u27e9, \u27e8\u010f\u27e9, \u27e8\u0159\u27e9, \u27e8\u0161\u27e9; this system has its origin in Czech orthography of the Hussite period.) \u27e8z\u27e9 can also appear with diacritical marks, namely \u27e8\u017a\u27e9 and \u27e8\u017c\u27e9, which are used to represent the sounds and . They also appear in the digraphs \u27e8d\u017a\u27e9 () and \u27e8d\u017c\u27e9 ().\nHungarian uses \u27e8z\u27e9 in the digraphs \u27e8sz\u27e9 (expressing , as opposed to the value of \u27e8s\u27e9, which is ), and \u27e8zs\u27e9 (expressing ). The letter \u27e8z\u27e9 on its own represents .\nIn Modern Scots, \u27e8z\u27e9 usually represents , but is also used in place of the obsolete letter \u27e8\u021d\u27e9 (yogh), which represents and . Whilst there are a few common nouns which use \u27e8z\u27e9 in this manner, such as (pronounced 'brulgey' meaning broil), \u27e8z\u27e9 as a yogh substitute is more common in people's names and placenames. Often the names are pronounced to follow the apparent English spelling, so Mackenzie is commonly pronounced with . Menzies, however, retains the pronunciation of 'Mingus'.\nAmong non-European languages that have adopted the Latin alphabet, \u27e8z\u27e9 usually stands for , such as in Azerbaijani, Igbo, Indonesian, Shona, Swahili, Tatar, Turkish, and Zulu. \u27e8z\u27e9 represents in Northern Sami and Inari Sami. In Turkmen, \u27e8z\u27e9 represents .\nIn the Nihon-shiki, Kunrei-shiki, and Hepburn romanisations of Japanese, \u27e8z\u27e9 stands for a phoneme whose allophones include and (see Yotsugana). Additionally, in the Nihon-shiki and Kunrei-shiki systems, \u27e8z\u27e9 is used to represent that same phoneme before , where it's pronounced .\nIn the Jyutping romanization of Cantonese, \u27e8z\u27e9 represents . Other romanizations use either \u27e8j\u27e9, \u27e8ch\u27e9, or \u27e8ts\u27e9.\nOther systems.\nIn the International Phonetic Alphabet, \u27e8z\u27e9 represents the voiced alveolar sibilant. The graphical variant \u27e8\u27e9 was adopted as the sign for the voiced postalveolar fricative.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Zippy's most famous quotation, \"Are we having fun yet?\", appears in \"Bartlett's Familiar Quotations\" and became a catchphrase. He almost always wears a yellow muumuu/clown suit with large red polka dots, and puffy, white clown shoes. (Other forms of attire may be seen when appropriate to the context, e.g. a toga.) Although in name and appearance, Zippy is a microcephalic, he is distinctive not so much for his skull shape, or for any identifiable form of brain damage, but for his enthusiasm for philosophical non sequiturs (\"All life is a blur of Republicans and meat!\"), verbal free association, and pursuit of popular culture ephemera. His wholehearted devotion to random artifacts satirizes the excesses of consumerism.\nThe character of Zippy the Pinhead initially appeared in underground publications during the 1970s. The \"Zippy\" comic is distributed by King Features Syndicate to more than 100 newspapers, and Griffith self-syndicates strips to college newspapers and alternative weeklies. The strip is unique among syndicated multi-panel dailies for its characteristics of literary nonsense, including a near-absence of either straightforward gags or continuous narrative, and for its unusually intricate artwork, which is reminiscent of the style of Griffith's 1970s underground comix.\nOrigin.\nZippy made his first appearance in \"Real Pulp Comics\" #1 in March 1971, published by Print Mint.\nThe strip began in the \"Berkeley Barb\" in 1976 and was syndicated nationally soon after (by Rip Off Press), originally as a weekly strip. When William Randolph Hearst III took over the \"San Francisco Examiner\" in 1985, he offered Griffith an opportunity to do \"Zippy\" as a daily strip. Several months later, it was picked up for worldwide daily distribution by King Features Syndicate in 1986, appearing in 60 daily papers by 1988. The Sunday \"Zippy\" debuted in 1990. When the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" canceled \"Zippy\" briefly in 2002, the newspaper received thousands of letters of protest, including one from Robert Crumb, who called \"Zippy\" \"by far the very best daily comic strip that exists in America.\" The \"Chronicle\" quickly restored the strip but dropped it again in 2004, leading to more protests as well as grateful letters from non-fans.\nThe strip has developed a cult following and continues to be syndicated in many newspapers.\nCharacters and story.\nZippy's original appearance was partly inspired by the microcephalic Schlitzie, from the film \"Freaks\", which was enjoying something of a cult revival at the time, and P. T. Barnum's sideshow performer Zip the Pinhead, who may not have been a microcephalic but was nevertheless billed as one.\nGriffith has never committed himself to a set origin story or time period for Zippy; no fewer than five have appeared:\nZippy's favorite foods are taco sauce and Ding Dongs. He sometimes snacks on Polysorbate 80. \nZippy's signature expression of surprise is \"Yow!\" Zippy's unpredictable behavior sometimes causes severe difficulty for others, but never for himself. (For example, drug dealers tried to use him as a drug mule, but lost their stash or were jailed.)\nHe is married to a nearly identical pinhead named Zerbina, has two children, Fuelrod (a boy) and Meltdown (a girl), both apparently in their early teens, and owns a cat named Dingy. His parents, Ebb and Flo, originally from Kansas, live in Florida. Zippy's angst-ridden twin brother Lippy also frequently appears. He is portrayed as Zippy's total opposite, often dressed in a conservative suit, thinking sequentially, and avoiding his brother's penchant for non-sequiturs. In a daily strip dated 8 March 2005, he is depicted as being deeply moved by the poetry of Leonard Cohen, the landscape paintings of Maxfield Parrish, and the music of John Tesh.\nHe has four close friends:\nA humanoid toad, Mr. Toad (less commonly \"Mr. the Toad\") who embodies blind greed and selfishness, appears occasionally (along with his wife, Mrs. Toad, and their children, Mustang and Blazer), as do The Toadettes, a group of mindless and interchangeable amphibians, who pop up here and there; and the Stupidity Patrol, described by Bill Griffith as \"cruising the streets of L.A., correcting the behavior of insensitive louts\". (Mr. Toad first appeared in underground strips done by Griffith in 1969.)\nAnother occasionally occurring character is God, appearing either as a disembodied head or a head superimposed on various peoples' bodies. He is depicted as either conversing with Zippy on various philosophical topics, or commenting on humanity in general.\nIn his daily-strip incarnation, Zippy spends much of his time traveling and commenting on interesting places; recent strips focus on his fascination with roadside icons featuring giant beings; Zippy also frequently participates in his long-running conversation with the giant fiberglass doggie mascot of San Francisco's Doggie Diner chain (later, the Carousel diner near the San Francisco Zoo). For a while the Zippy website encouraged people to send photos of interesting places for Zippy to visit in the strip.\nIn 2007, Griffith began to focus his daily strip on the fictional city of Dingburg, Maryland, Zippy's \"birthplace\" which, according to the cartoonist, is located \"17 miles west of Baltimore.\"\nAppearances elsewhere.\nComedian Jim Turner appeared as Zippy on college campuses as well as in several live-action short videos alongside Diane Noomin, in character as DiDi Glitz, for a satirical campaign during the 1980 presidential election, which Griffith wrote 8 episodes of that aired on local San Francisco station KQED.\nFollowing years of a \"Zippy\" movie project that was never made between 1984 and 1995, Griffith devoted dozens of strips to his real and imagined dealings with Hollywood. An animated television series, to be produced by Film Roman and co-written by Diane Noomin, was in negotiations from 1996 to 2001, but fell through after Film Roman failed to find funding.\nOn July 9, 2004, Zippy made his stage debut in San Francisco in \"Fun: The Concept\" at the Dark Room Theatre. Bill Griffith approved of the adaptation, though he did not work on the project. \"Fun: The Concept\" was adapted by Denzil J. Meyers with Jim Fourniadis.\nA collection of about 1,000 Zippy quotes was formerly packaged and distributed with the Emacs text editor. Some installations of the \"fortune\" command, available on most Unix-type systems, also contain this collection. This gives Zippy a very wide audience, since most Emacs users can have a random Zippy quote printed on their screen by typing \"M-x yow\" and most Linux or BSD users can get a random quote by typing \"fortune zippy\" in a shell. However, as a result of a decision by Richard Stallman prompted by FSF lawyer Eben Moglen, motivated by copyright concerns, these quotes were erased in GNU Emacs 22. Zippy under emacs now will only say \"Yow! Legally-imposed CULTURE-reduction is CABBAGE-BRAINED!\". Zippy can be restored by replacing the yow file with one from an older Emacs.\nAfter Griffith criticized Scott Adams' comic \"Dilbert\" for being \"a kind of childish, depleted shell of a once-vibrant medium,\" Adams responded a year and half later on May 18, 1998, with a comic strip called \"Pippy the Ziphead\", \"cramming as much artwork in as possible so no one will notice there's only one joke... [and] it's on the reader.\" Dilbert notes that the strip is \"nothing but a clown with a small head who says random things\" and Dogbert responds that he is \"maintaining his artistic integrity by creating a comic that no one will enjoy.\"\nZippy also makes an appearance in the 1995 round-robin work \"The Narrative Corpse\" where he takes the stick figure protagonist to Croatia for \"peace and quiet\". Another appearance can be found in the Ramones' comic book-themed 2005 compilation \"Weird Tales of the Ramones\", consisting of Zippy asking to play \"air glockenspiel\" for the band.\nZippy appears in several issues of the Red Anvil Comics 2011 comic book series \"War of the Independents\".\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "34427", "revid": "50516991", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34427", "title": "Zulu people", "text": "Nguni ethnic group of Southern Africa\nZulu people (; ) are a native people of Southern Africa of the Nguni. The Zulu people are the largest ethnic group and nation in South Africa, living mainly in the province of KwaZulu-Natal.\nThey originated from Nguni communities who took part in the Bantu migrations over millennia. As the clans integrated, the rulership of Shaka brought success to the Zulu nation due to his improved military tactics and organization.\nZulus take pride in their ceremonies such as the Umhlanga, or Reed Dance, and their various forms of beadwork.\nThe art and skill of beadwork take part in the identification of Zulu people and act as a form of communication and dedication to the nation and specific traditions. Today, the Zulu people are predominantly Christian, but have created a syncretic religion that is combined with the Zulu's prior belief systems.\nHistory of the people of Zulu.\nOrigins.\nThe Zulu were originally a minor clan in what is today Northern KwaZulu-Natal, founded c.\u20091574 by Zulu kaMalandela. In the Nguni languages, \"iZulu\" means \"heaven\" or weather\".\" At that time, the area was occupied by many large Nguni communities and clans (also called the \"isizwe\" people or nation, or called \"isibongo\", referring to their clan or family name). Nguni communities had migrated down Africa's east coast over millennia, as part of the Bantu migrations. As the nation began to develop, the rulership of Shaka (about 250 years after it was founded) brought the clans together to build a cohesive identity for the Zulu.\nStrength of the Zulu nation.\nThe Zulu nation's growth and strength were based on its military organization and skills during Shaka's reign and those of his successors. The military was organized around the \"ukubuthwa\" (\"to be enrolled\") system, which did away with initiation ceremonies for the most part. Each age set, or group of young men of the same age, was assigned to the same regiment (\"ibutho\", singular; \"amabutho\", plural), according to the system. Girls were also subject to \"ukubuthwa\", but they were usually assigned to an age group rather than to a regiment. The \"amabutho\" were housed in military barracks (singular, \"ikhanda\"; plural, \"amakhanda\") located throughout the kingdom and under the command of a close relative to (or someone else appointed by) the king.\nThe barracks were designed and laid out similarly to an \"umuzi\", but on a much larger scale. Aside from military duties, the \"izinsizwa\" (\"young men\") were also responsible for the repair and maintenance of their barracks.\nKingdom.\nThe Zulu formed a powerful state in 1816 under the leader Shaka. Shaka, as the Zulu commander of the Mthethwa Empire and successor to Dingiswayo, united what was once a confederation of lordships into an imposing empire under Zulu hegemony. Shaka built a militarized system known as Impi featuring conscription, a standing army, new weaponry, regimentation, and encirclement battle tactics. Zulu expansion was a major factor of the Mfecane (\"Crushing\") that depopulated large areas of southern Africa. It was during this period when Shaka deployed an army regiment for raiding nations in the North. The regiment which was under Mzilikazi disobeyed Shaka and crafted a plan to continue raiding up-North forming another dialect of Zulu language referred to as Northern Ndebele (now in Zimbabwe). Another group under Zwangendaba who was Shakas relative from the Gumbi Clan from Pongola and military commander trekked northwards crossing the Zambezi River at Chirundu in 1835 into Zambia setting up the Ngoni nation that extended to Malawi, Mozambique and Southern Tanzania.\nConflict with the British.\nIn mid-December 1878, envoys of the British crown delivered an ultimatum to 11 chiefs representing the then-current king of the Zulu empire, Cetshwayo. Under the British terms delivered to the Zulu, Cetshwayo would have been required to disband his army and accept British sovereignty. Cetshwayo refused, and war between the Zulus and African contingents of the British crown began on January 12, 1879. Despite an early victory for the Zulus at the Battle of Isandlwana on 22 January, the British fought back and won the Battle at Rorke's Drift, and decisively defeated the Zulu army by July at the Battle of Ulundi.\nAbsorption into Natal.\nAfter Cetshwayo's capture a month following his defeat, the British divided the Zulu Empire into 13 \"kinglets\". The sub-kingdoms fought amongst each other until 1883 when Cetshwayo was reinstated as king over Zululand. This still did not stop the fighting and the Zulu monarch was forced to flee his realm by Zibhebhu, one of the 13 kinglets, supported by Boer mercenaries. Cetshwayo died of a heart attack in February 1884, leaving his son, the 15-year-old Dinuzulu, to inherit the throne. In-fighting between the Zulu continued for years until in 1897 Zululand was absorbed fully into the British colony of Natal.\nApartheid years.\nKwaZulu homeland.\nUnder apartheid, the homeland of KwaZulu (\"Kwa\" meaning \"place of\") was created for the Zulu people. In 1970, the Bantu Homeland Citizenship Act provided that all Zulus would become citizens of KwaZulu, losing their South African citizenship. KwaZulu consisted of many disconnected pieces of land, in what is now KwaZulu-Natal. Hundreds of thousands of Zulu people living on privately owned \"black spots\" outside of KwaZulu were dispossessed and forcibly moved to bantustans \u2013 worse land previously reserved for whites contiguous to existing areas of KwaZulu. By 1993, approximately 5.2 million Zulu people lived in KwaZulu, and approximately 2 million lived in the rest of South Africa. The Chief Minister of KwaZulu, from its creation in 1970 (as Zululand) was Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi. In 1994, KwaZulu was joined with the province of Natal, to form the modern KwaZulu-Natal.\n\"Inkatha YeSizwe\".\n\"Inkatha YeSizwe\" means \"the crown of the nation\". In 1975, Buthelezi revived the Inkatha YaKwaZulu, the predecessor of the Inkatha Freedom Party. This organisation was nominally a protest movement against Apartheid but held more conservative views than the ANC. For example, Inkatha was opposed to the armed struggle, and sanctions against South Africa. Inkatha was initially on good terms with the ANC, but the two organisations came into increasing conflict beginning in 1976 in the aftermath of the Soweto Uprising.\nLanguage.\nThe language of the Zulu people is \"isiZulu\", a Bantu language; more specifically, part of the Nguni subgroup. Zulu is the most widely spoken language in South Africa, where it is an official language. More than half of the South African population can understand it, with over 13.78 million first-language and over 15 million second-language speakers. Many Zulu people also speak Xitsonga, Sesotho and others from among South Africa's 12 official languages.\nCeremony.\nUmhlanga.\nThe Zulu people celebrate an annual event that was established in 1984 called the Umhlanga or Reed Dance. This event takes place at the royal capital near Nongoma. This traditional ceremony is performed by young women from all parts of the kingdom to perform in front of the monarch and his guests. The purpose of this event is to promote pride in virginity and to restrain sexual relationships. Beadwork is a prominent attire that is worn at the Umhlanga. The beadwork is not only worn by the dancers but by the guests as well. The Umhlanga is not purely for a time of dance. The King also uses this time to speak to the young men and women of the nation. The King discusses current political issues.\nBeadwork.\nHistory of beadwork.\nThe creation of beadwork dates back to the times of war for the Zulu people. This particular form of beadwork was known as \"iziqu\", medallions of war. Often worn as a necklace, the beads were displayed in a criss-cross formation across the shoulders. This assemblage of beads by the warriors represented a symbol of bravery. Before the use of glass was apparent to the Zulu, beadwork was derived from wood, seeds and berries. It was not until the arrival of Europeans that glass became a trade material with the Portuguese, which soon became abundantly available to the Zulu.\nPurpose of beadwork.\nBeadwork is a form of communication for the Zulu people. Typically when one is wearing multiple beads, it is a sign of wealth. The more beads one is wearing, the wealthier they are perceived. The beads have the potential to convey information about a person's age, gender and marital status. The design of the beads often conveys a particular message. However, one must know the context of their use to read the message correctly. Depending on the area in which the beadwork was made, some designs can depict different messages compared to other areas. A message could be embedded into the colours and structure of the beads or could be strictly for decorative purposes. Beadwork can be worn in everyday use but is often worn during important occasions such as weddings, or ceremonies. For example, beadwork is featured during the coming of age for a young girl or worn during dances. The beaded elements complement the costumes worn by the Zulu people to bring out a sense of finery or prestige.\nApparel.\nBeadwork is worn by all men, women, and children at any age. Depending on which stage of life an individual is in, the beadwork indicates different meanings. Beadwork is predominantly worn when young Zulu people are courting or in search of love affairs. The wearing of decorative beadwork can act as an attempt to grab the attention of someone of the opposite sex. Also, the gifting of beadwork is a way of communicating interest with lovers. During the transition from single to married women, beadwork is shown through a beaded cloth apron worn over a pleated leather skirt. As for older or mature women, beadwork is displayed in detailed headdresses and cowhide skirts that extend past the knee. These long skirts are also seen on unmarried women and young marriageable-age girls. Men are more conservative when wearing beadwork. However, when a young boy is seen wearing multiple necklaces, it is a sign that he is highly interested in these gifts from various girls. The more gifts he wears, the higher the prestige he obtains.\nColours of beads.\nVarious forms of beadwork are found in different colour schemes. Typically, there are four different types of colour schemes:\nThe colours of beads might hold different meanings based on the area that they originated from. It is often that this can lead to misrepresentation or confusion when attempting to understand what the beadwork is communicating. One cannot assume that the colour system is standard across South Africa. In some areas, the colour green symbolises jealousy in a certain area, but in other areas it symbolises grass. One must know the origin of the beadwork to interpret the message correctly.\nClothing.\nZulus wear a variety of attire, both traditional for ceremonial or culturally celebratory occasions, and modern Westernised clothing for everyday use. The women dress differently depending on whether they are single, engaged, or married. The men wore a leather belt with two strips of hide hanging down front and back.\nIn South Africa, the miniskirt has existed since pre-colonial times. In African cultures, such as the Basotho, the Batswana, the Bapedi, the Amaswati and the AmaZulu, women wore traditional miniskirts as cultural attire. These skirts are not seen as shameless, but are used to cover the women's genitals. The skirts are called isigcebhezana and are essential in Zulu ceremonies. For example, Umemulo is a ceremony for women who turn 21 years of age. It represents a huge transition in the woman's life because it is a symbol of her being ready to accept a boyfriend and even get married. Additionally, each stage of a Zulu's life is determined by a specific type of clothing. An unmarried woman wears a skirt and nothing on top, but as she grows up, the woman starts to cover up her body because a time will come when she will be a married woman and an old woman. Nonetheless, a special type of clothing is reserved for pregnant women. When a woman is pregnant she wears an https://\", a thick belt made from dried grass, covered with glass or plastic beadwork, to support her swelling stomach and its additional weight.\nSocietal roles.\nMen.\nThe Zulu people govern under a patriarchal society. Men are perceived as the head of the household and seen as authoritative figures. Zulu men identify themselves with great pride and dignity. They also compare themselves to qualities of powerful wild animals such as bulls, lions and elephants. The men contribute to society by acting as defenders, hunters, and lovers. The Zulu men are also in charge of herding the cattle, educating themselves on the lives of disciplined warriors, creating weapons, and learning the art of stick fighting.\nStick fighting.\nThe art of stick fighting is a celebration of manhood for Zulu men. These men can begin to learn this art of fighting from as young as the age of five years old. There are multiple reasons why men learn how to stick fight. For example, men may want to learn so that they can set right any wrongs or insults made towards them. Other reasons some men choose to learn are for sporting purposes, proving skills or manliness, and self-defense. The goal of stick fighting is to injure the opponent and sometimes even kill. There are rules of etiquette that must be abided by when stick fighting. The men can only fight a man the same age as them. One cannot hit the opponent when they lose their stick. Only sticks are allowed when fighting.\nWomen.\nThe women in Zulu society often perform domestic chores such as cleaning, raising children, collecting water and firewood, laundry, tending to crops, cooking, and making clothes. Women can be considered as the sole income earners of the household. A woman's stages of life lead up to the goal of marriage. As a woman approaches puberty, she is known as a \"tshitshi\". A \"tshitshi\" reveals her singleness by wearing less clothing. Single women typically do not wear clothing to cover their head, breasts, legs and shoulders. Engaged women wear hairnets to show their marital status to society and married women cover themselves in clothing and headdresses. Also, women are taught to defer to men and treat them with great respect. The women are always bound by a male figure.\nReligion and beliefs.\nMost Zulu people state their beliefs to be Christian. Some of the most common churches to which they belong are African Initiated Churches, especially the Zion Christian Church, Nazareth Baptist Church and United African Apostolic Church, although membership of major European Churches, such as the Dutch Reformed, Anglican and Catholic Churches are also common. Nevertheless, many Zulus retain their traditional pre-Christian belief system of ancestor worship in parallel with their Christianity.\nTraditional Zulu religion includes belief in a creator God (\"uNkulunkulu\") who is above interacting in day-to-day human life, although this belief appears to have originated from efforts by early Christian missionaries to frame the idea of the Christian God in Zulu terms. Traditionally, the more strongly held Zulu belief was in ancestor spirits (\"amaThongo\" or \"amaDlozi\"), who had the power to intervene in people's lives, for good or ill. This belief continues to be widespread among the modern Zulu population.\nTraditionally, the Zulu recognize several elements to be present in a human being: the physical body (\"inyama yomzimba\" or \"umzimba\"); the breath or life force (\"umoya womphefumulo\" or \"umoya\"); and the \"shadow\" prestige or personality (\"isithunzi\"). Once the \"umoya\" leaves the body, the \"isithunzi\" may live on as an ancestral spirit (\"idlozi\") only if certain conditions were met in life. Behaving with ubuntu, or showing respect and generosity towards others, enhances one's moral standing or prestige in the community, one's \"isithunzi\". By contrast, acting in a negative way towards others can reduce the \"isithunzi\", and the \"isithunzi\" can fade away completely.\nTo appeal to the spirit world, a diviner (\"sangoma\") must invoke the ancestors through divination processes to determine the problem. Then, a herbalist (\"inyanga\") prepares a mixture (\"muthi\") to be consumed to influence the ancestors. As such, diviners and herbalists play an important part in the daily lives of the Zulu people. However, a distinction is made between white \"muthi\" (\"umuthi omhlope\"), which has positive effects, such as healing or the prevention or reversal of misfortune, and black \"muthi\" (\"umuthi omnyama\"), which can bring illness or death to others, or ill-gotten wealth to the user. Users of black \"muthi\" are considered witches, and shunned by society.\nChristianity had difficulty gaining a foothold among the Zulu people, and when it did it was in a syncretic fashion. Isaiah Shembe, considered the Zulu Messiah, presented a form of Christianity (the Nazareth Baptist Church) which incorporated traditional customs.\nFurthermore, the Zulu people also practice a ceremony called Ukweshwama. The killing of the bull is part of Ukweshwama, an annual ceremony that celebrates a new harvest. It is a day of prayer when Zulus thank their creator and their ancestors. By tradition, a new regiment of young warriors is asked to confront a bull to prove its courage, inheriting the beast's strength as it expires. It is believed this power was then transferred to the Zulu king.\nBride wealth.\nZulu people have a system called \"\". This term is particularly used by Zulu people when it comes to bride wealth. Every African ethnic group has different requirements when it comes to bride wealth. In pre-capitalist Zulu society, ilobolo was inextricably linked to the ownership of cattle. During that time, there was not a fixed number of cattle required for the wedding to happen; it could be paid before the marriage or during the marriage. The groom takes the cattle from his father's herd to perpetuate the family heritage. Nonetheless, this ritual changed during colonisation because in 1869, Theophilus Shepstone, then Natal Secretary for Native Affairs, formalized the ilobolo payment to 10 cattle for commoners (plus the ingquthu cow for the mother), 15 for hereditary chief siblings and 20-plus for the daughters of a chief. They found it too lenient to let the groom give whatever amount he wanted, so they decided to establish a specific number of cattle that would be needed before or at the start of the marriage. This has been accepted by Zulu men who were educated in mission schools, but according to more ritual people this became \"untraditional\". Additionally, with the instauration of the Natal Code, some Zulu men decided to settle another way in which they could decrease the ilobo: offer a token payment or bring a present for the father of the prospective bride to decrease the \"ilobolo\" amount to be paid. The payment of \"ilobolo\" can be difficult for some families, but as it is often considered a symbol of pride and respect, many are willing to maintain this tradition as long as possible.\nIn popular culture.\nTelevision series\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

After many years of suggested mergers, Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia, and Nyasaland were merged into the British Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland.\nIn 1960, the British prime minister, Harold Macmillan, declared that the age of colonial rule in Africa was ending. Finally, in December 1963, the federation was dissolved, and the Republic of Zambia was formed out of Northern Rhodesia on 23 October 1964.\nPrehistoric era.\nArchaeological excavation work on the Zambezi Valley and Kalambo Falls show a succession of human cultures. In particular, ancient camping site tools near the Kalambo Falls have been radiocarbon dated to more than 36,000 years ago.\nThe fossil skull remains of Broken Hill Man, dated between 300,000 and 125,000 years BC, further shows that the area was inhabited by early humans.\nKhoisan and Batwa.\nThe area of modern Zambia is known to have been inhabited by the Khoisan and Batwa peoples until around AD 300 when migrating Bantu began to settle around these areas. It is believed that the Khoisan people groups originated in East Africa and spread southwards around 150,000 years ago. The Twa people were split into two groups: The Kafwe Twa lived around the Kafue flats while the other, The Lukanga Twa lived around the Lukanga Swamp. Many of the ancient rock arts in Zambia like the Mwela Rock Paintings, Mumbwa Caves, and https:// are attributed to these early hunter-gatherer groups. The Khoisan, and more especially the Twa, formed a patron-client relationship with farming Bantu peoples across central and southern Africa but were eventually either displaced by or absorbed into the Bantu groups.\nBantu (Abantu).\nThe Bantu people or Abantu (meaning people) are an enormous and diverse ethnolinguistic group that comprise the majority of people in much of East, Southern and Central Africa. Due to Zambia's location at the crossroads of Central Africa, Southern Africa, and the African Great Lakes, the history of the people that constitute modern Zambians is a history of these three regions.\nMany of the historical events in these three regions happened simultaneously. Thus, Zambia's history, like many African nation's histories, cannot be presented perfectly chronologically. The early history of the peoples of modern Zambia is deduced from oral records, archaeology, and written records mostly from non-Africans.\nBantu origins.\nThe Bantu people originally lived in West/Central Africa around what is today Cameroon/Nigeria. Around 4000 to 3000 years ago, they began a millennia-long expansion into much of the continent. This event has been called the Bantu Expansion, which was one of the largest human migrations in history. The Bantu are believed to have been the first to have brought iron working technology into large parts of Africa. The Bantu Expansion happened primarily through two routes: one was western via the Congo Basin and the other was eastern via the African Great Lakes.\nFirst Bantu settlement.\nAccording to recent scholarship by Nicholas Katanekwa, the earliest Bantu people in Zambia were the \"New Kalundu\" culture, arriving from the west along the Zambezi valley from the fourth century CE. These groups are associated with Guthrie group R, as well as the ancestors of the Shona, Venda, ans especially Mbwela peoples.\nThe next Bantu people to arrive in Zambia came through the eastern route via the African Great Lakes. They arrived later in the 1st millennium AD. Among them were the Tonga people (also called Ba-Tonga, \"Ba-\" meaning \"men\") and the Ba-Ila and other related groups who settled around Southern Zambia near Zimbabwe. According to Ba-Tonga oral records, they are believed to have come from the east near the \"big sea\".\nThey were later joined by the Ba-Tumbuka who settled around Eastern Zambia and Malawi.\nThese first Bantu people lived in large villages. They never had an organised unit under a chief or headman and worked as a community and help each other in times of field preparation for their crops. Villages moved around frequently as the soil became exhausted due to using the slash-and-burn technique of planting crops. They also kept large herds of cattle which formed an important part of their societies.\nThe first Bantu communities in Zambia were extremely self-sufficient. Many groups of people who encountered them were very impressed by this self-sufficiency. The early European missionaries that settled in Southern Zambia also noted the extreme independence of these Bantu societies, one of these missionaries noted:\n\"[If] weapons for war, hunting, and domestic purposes are needed, the [Tonga] man goes to the hills and digs until he finds the iron ore. He smelts it and with the iron thus obtained makes axes, hoes, and other useful implements. He burns wood and makes charcoal for his forge. His bellows are made from the skins of animals and the pipes are clay tile, and the anvil and hammers are also pieces of the iron he has obtained. He moulds, welds, shapes, and performs all the work of the ordinary blacksmith.\" \nThese early Bantu settlers also participated in the trade at the site Ingombe Ilede (which translate sleeping cow in Chi-Tonga because the fallen baobab tree appears to resembles a cow) in Southern Zambia, at this trading site they met numerous Kalanga/Shona traders from Great Zimbabwe and Swahili traders from the East African Swahili Coast. Ingombe Ilede was one of the most important trading posts for rulers of Great Zimbabwe, others being the Swahili port cities like of Sofala.\nThe goods traded at Ingombe Ilede included: fabrics, beads, gold, and bangles. Some of these items came from what is today southern Democratic Republic of Congo and Kilwa Kisiwani while others as far away as India, China and the Arab World. The African traders were later joined by the Portuguese in the 16th century.\nThe decline of Great Zimbabwe, due to increasing trade competition from other Kalanga/Shona kingdoms like Khami and Mutapa, spelt the end of Ingombe Ilede.\nFurther Bantu settlement.\nThe third mass settlement of Bantu people into Zambia was of people groups that are believed to have taken the central-western route of the Bantu migration through the Congo Basin. These Bantu people spent the majority of their existence in what is today the Democratic Republic of Congo and are ancestors of the majority of modern Zambians. \nWhile it was previously speculated that the Bemba people or AbaBemba have a strong ancient connection to the Kongo Kingdom through BaKongo ruler Mwene Kongo VIII Mvemba this, is not supported by evidence.\nLuba-Lunda States \nThe Bemba, along with other related groups like the Lamba, Bisa, Senga, Kaonde, Swaka, Nkoya and Soli, formed integral parts of the Luba Kingdom in Upemba part of the Democratic Republic of Congo and have a strong relation to the BaLuba people. The area which the Luba Kingdom occupied has been inhabited by early farmers and iron-workers since the 300's AD. Over time these communities learned to use nets, harpoons, make dugout canoes, clear canals through swamps and make dams as high as 2.5 meters.\nAs a result, they grew a diverse economy trading fish, copper and iron items, and salt for goods from other parts of Africa like the Swahili Coast and, later on, the Portuguese. From these communities arose the Luba Kingdom in the 14th century.\nThe Luba Kingdom was a large kingdom with a centralised government and smaller independent chiefdoms. It had large trading networks that linked the forests in the Congo Basin and the mineral-rich plateaus of what is today Copperbelt Province and stretched from the Atlantic Coast to the Indian Ocean Coast. The arts were also held in high esteem in the kingdom and artisans where held in high regards. \nThe Luba Kingdom literature was also well developed. One renowned Luba genesis story that articulated the distinction between two types of Luba emperors as follows:\n\"Nkongolo Mwamba, the red king, and Ilunga Mbidi Kiluwe, a prince of legendary black complexion. Nkongolo Mwamba is the drunken and cruel despot, Ilunga Mbidi Kiluwe, the refined and gentle prince. Nkongolo the red is a man without manners, a man who eats in public, gets drunk, and cannot control himself, whereas [Ilunga] Mbidi Kiluwe is a man of reservation, obsessed with good manners; he does not eat in public, controls his language and his behaviour, and keeps a distance from the vices and modus vivendi of ordinary people. Nkongolo Mwamba symbolizes the embodiment of tyranny, whereas Mbidi Kiluwe remains the admired caring and compassionate kin.\" \nIn the same region of Southern Congo the Lunda people were made into a satellite of the Luba empire and adopted forms of Luba culture and governance and thus became the Lunda empire to the south. According to Lunda genesis myths, a Luba hunter named Chibinda Ilunga son of Ilunga Mbidi Kiluwe introduced the Luba model of statecraft to the Lunda sometime around 1600 when he married a local Lunda princess named Lueji and was granted control of her kingdom. Most rulers who claimed descent from Luba ancestors were integrated into the Luba empire. The Lunda kings, however, remained separate and actively expanded their political and economic dominance over the region.\nThe Lunda, like its parent state Luba, also traded with both coasts, the Atlantic and Indian Ocean. With ruler Mwaant Yaav Naweej had established trade routes to the Atlantic coast and initiated direct contact with European traders eager for slaves and forest products and controlling the regional copper trade, and settlements around Lake Mweru regulated commerce from the East African coast.\nThe Luba-Lunda states eventually declined as a result of both Atlantic slave trade in the west and Indian Ocean slave trade in the east and wars with breakaway factions of the kingdoms. The Chokwe, a group that is highly related to the Luvale and formed a Lunda satellite state, initially suffered from the European demand for slaves but once the broke away from the Lunda State, they defeated the previous parent state and became notorious slave traders, exporting slaves to both coasts. The Chokwe eventually were defeated by the other ethnic groups and the Portuguese.\nThis instability caused the collapse of the Luba-Lunda States and a dispersal of people into various parts of Zambia from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The majority of Zambians trace their ancestry to the Luba-Lunda and surrounding Central African states.\nMaravi Confederacy \nIn the 1200s, before the founding of the Luba-Lunda states, a group of Bantu people started migrating from the Congo basin to Lake Mweru then finally settled around Lake Malawi. These migrants are believed to have been one of the inhabitants around the Upemba area in the Democratic Republic of Congo. By the 1400s these groups of migrants collectively called the Maravi, most prominently among them was the Chewa people, started assimilating other Bantu groups like the Tumbuka.\nIn 1480 the Maravi Empire was founded by the Kalonga (paramount chief of the Maravi) from the Phiri clan one of the main clans with the others being Banda, Mwale and Nkhoma. The Maravi Empire stretched from the Indian Ocean through what today is Mozambique to Zambia and large parts of Malawi. The political organization of the Maravi resembled the Luba and is believed to have originated from there, the primary export of the Maravi was Ivory which was transported to Swahili brokers.\nIron was also manufactured and exported. In the 1590s the Portuguese endeavoured to monopolize the Maravi export trade. This attempt was met with outrage by the Maravi of Lundu who released their WaZimba armed force. The WaZimba sacked the Portuguese trade towns of Tete, Sena and various other towns.\nThe Maravi are also believed to have brought the traditions that would become Nyau secret society from the Upemba. The Nyau form the cosmology or indigenous religion of the people of Maravi. The Nyau society consists of ritual dance performances and masks used for the dances, this belief system spread around the region.\nThe Maravi went into decline due to succession disputes within the confederacy, attack by the Ngoni and slave raids from the Yao.\nMutapa Empire &amp; Mfecane\nAs Great Zimbabwe was in decline. One of its princes, Nyatsimba Mutota, broke away from the state forming a new empire called Mutapa. The title of Mwene Mutapa, meaning \"Ravager of the Lands\", was bestowed on him and subsequent rulers.\nThe Mutapa Empire ruled territory between the Zambezi and Limpopo rivers, in what is now Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique, from the 14th to the 17th century. By its peak, Mutapa had conquered the Dande area of the Tonga and Tavara. The Mutapa Empire predominately engaged in the Indian Ocean transcontinental trade with and via the WaSwahili. They primary exported gold and ivory for silk and ceramics from Asia.\nLike their contemporaries in Maravi, Mutapa had problems with the arriving Portuguese traders. The peak of this uneasy relationship was reached when the Portuguese attempted to influence the kingdoms internal affairs by establishing markets in the kingdom and converting the population to Christianity. This action caused outrage by the Muslim WaSwahili living in the capital. This chaos gave the Portuguese the excuse they were searching for to warrant an attack on the kingdom and try to control its gold mines and ivory routes. This attack failed when the Portuguese succumbed to disease along the Zambezi river.\nIn the 1600s, internal disputes and civil war began the decline of Mutapa. The weakened kingdom was finally conquered by the Portuguese and was eventually taken over by rival Shona states.\nIt is hypothesised by Julian Cobbing that the presence of early Europeans slave trading and attempts to control resources in various parts of Bantu Speaking Africa caused the gradual militarization of the people in the region. This can be observed with the Maravi's WaZimba warrior cast who, once defeating the Portuguese, remained quite militaristic afterwards.\nThe Portuguese presence in the region was also a major reason for the founding of the Rozvi Empire, a breakaway state of Mutapa. The ruler of the Rozvi, Changamire Dombo, became one of the most powerful leaders in South-Central Africa's history. Under his leadership, the Rozvi defeated the Portuguese and expelled them from their trading posts along the Zambezi river.\nBut perhaps the most notable instance of this increased militarization was the rise of the Zulu under the leadership of Shaka. Pressures from the English colonialists in the Cape and increased militarization of the Zulu resulted in the Mfecane (the crushing). The Zulu expanded by assimilating the women and children of tribes they defeated, if the men of these Nguni tribes escaped slaughter, they used the military tactics of the Zulu to attack other groups.\nThis caused mass displacements, wars and raids throughout Southern, Central and Eastern Africa as Nguni or Ngoni tribes made their way throughout the region and is referred to as the Mfecane. The arriving Nguni under the leadership of Zwagendaba crossed the Zambezi river moving northwards. The Ngoni were the final blow to the already weakened Maravi Empire. Many Nguni eventually settled around what is today Zambia, Malawi, Mozambique and Tanzania and assimilated into neighboring tribes.\nIn the western part of Zambia, another Southern African group of Sotho-Tswana heritage called the Kololo manage to conquer the local inhabitants who were migrants from the fallen Luba and Lunda states called the Luyana or Aluyi. The Luyana established the Barotse Kingdom on the floodplains of the Zambezi upon their arrival from Katanga. Under the Kololo, the Kololo language was imposed upon the Luyana until the Luyana revolted and overthrew the Kololo by this time the Luyana language was largely forgotten and a new hybrid language emerged, SiLozi and the Luyana began to refer to themselves as Lozi.\nAt the end of the 18th century, some of the Mbunda migrated to Barotseland, Mongu upon the migration of among others, the Ciyengele. The Aluyi and their leader, the Litunga Mulambwa, especially valued the Mbunda for their fighting ability.\nBy the late 19th century, most of the various peoples of Zambia were established in their current areas.\nColonial period.\nIn 1888, Cecil Rhodes who was spearheading British commercial and political interests in Central Africa, obtained a mineral rights concessions from local chiefs. In the same year, Northern and Southern Rhodesia, now Zambia and Zimbabwe, were proclaimed a British sphere of influence. In the beginning, the territory was administered by Rhodes' British South Africa Company (BSAC), which showed little interest in the province and used it mainly as a source of labour.\nThe most important factor in the colony's economy was copper. The discovery of which is due partly to an American scout, Frederick Russell Burnham, who in 1895 led and oversaw the massive Northern Territories (BSA) Exploration Co. expedition which established that major copper deposits existed in Central Africa. Along the Kafue River in then Northern Rhodesia, Burnham saw many similarities to copper deposits he had worked in the United States, and he encountered natives wearing copper bracelets.\nIn 1923 the British government decided not to renew the company's charter. As a result, Southern Rhodesia was annexed formally and granted self-government in 1923. After negotiations, the administration of Northern Rhodesia was transferred to the British Colonial Office in 1924 as a protectorate, with Livingstone as capital. The capital was transferred to the more central Lusaka in 1935. A Legislative Council was established, of which five members were elected by the small European minority (only 4,000 people), but none by the African population.\nIn 1928, enormous copper deposits were discovered in the region which then became known as the Copperbelt. This transformed Northern Rhodesia from a prospective land of colonization for white farmers to a copper exporter. By 1938, the country produced 13% of the world's copper extraction. The sector was developed by two companies: the Anglo American Corporation (AAC) and the South African Rhodesian Selection Trust (RST), who controlled the sector until independence.\nThe poor safety record and increased taxes triggered a strike of African mineworkers in 1935, also known as the Copperbelt strike. The strike was crushed by the authorities and six miners were killed.\nDuring the Second World War, white miners came out on strike in 1940. Realizing the importance of their products for the war, they demanded higher salaries. This strike was followed by another by African mine workers.\nEven before the war, there had been talks about merging the two Rhodesias, but the process had been halted by the British authorities, and brought to an absolute stop by the war. Finally, in 1953, both Rhodesias were joined with Nyasaland (now Malawi) to form the Central African Federation. Northern Rhodesia was the centre of much of the turmoil and crises that afflicted the federation in its last years. At the core of the controversy were insistent African demands for greater participation in government and European fears of losing political control.\nA two-stage election held in October and December 1962 resulted in an African majority in the legislative council and an uneasy coalition between the two African nationalist parties. The council passed resolutions calling for Northern Rhodesia's secession from the federation and demanding full internal self-b under a new constitution, and a new national assembly based on a broader, more democratic franchise. On 31 December 1963, the federation was dissolved, and Northern Rhodesia became the Republic of Zambia on 24 October 1964.\nIndependence.\nAt independence, despite its considerable mineral wealth, Zambia faced major challenges. Domestically, there were few trained and educated Zambians capable of running the government, and the economy was largely dependent on foreign expertise. Most of Zambia's neighbouring countries were still colonies or under white minority rule.\nThe United National Independence Party (UNIP) won the pre-independence elections, gaining 55 of the 75 seats. The Zambian African National Congress won 10 seats, and the National Progressive Party won all the 10 seats reserved for whites. Kenneth Kaunda was elected Prime Minister, and later the same year president, as the country adopted a presidential system.\nKaunda adopted an ideology of African socialism, close to that of Julius Nyerere in Tanzania. Economical policies focused on central planning and nationalisation, and a system of one party rule was put in place.\nTowards one-party rule.\nIn 1968 Kaunda was re-elected as president. During the following years, Zambia adopted a one party system. In 1972 all political parties except UNIP were banned, and this was formalized in a new constitution that was adopted in 1973. The constitution framed a system called \"one-party participatory democracy\", which in practice, meant that UNIP became the sole political factor in the country. It provided for a strong president and a unicameral National Assembly. National policy was formulated by the Central Committee of UNIP. The cabinet executed the central committee's policy. In legislative elections, only candidates running for UNIP were allowed to participate. Even though inter-party competition was out of question, the contest for seats within UNIP was energetic. In the presidential elections, the only candidate allowed to run was the one elected as president of UNIP at the party's general conference. In this way Kaunda was re-elected unopposed with a yes or no vote in 1973, 1978, 1983 and 1988.\nThis did not, however, mean that there was no dissension to the imposition of a one-party rule in the country or within UNIP. Sylvester Mwamba Chisembele who was Cabinet Minister for Western Province (previously Barotse Province) together with UNIP leaders from 7 out of the 8 Provinces established a Committee of 14. The objective of the Committee of 14 which consisted two leaders from each of the 7 provinces was the establishment of a democratically elected council of two leaders from each province to rule the country by consensus with the President as Head of State. If this had been achieved, it would have meant the curtailing of the absolute power residing in President Kaunda. The Committee of 14 attended a meeting in State House at which President Kaunda agreed to consider their proposals. However, later he banned the Committee of 14 and this action was followed by the suspension of Sylvester Chisembele and several leaders were sacked. Chisembele later rejoined the Cabinet as Minister for Eastern Province and two years later in 1977 he was transferred in the same position to the Copperbelt Province, where the political situation was tense, especially so because of the forthcoming General Elections. Simon M. Kapwepwe and Harry Mwaanga Nkumbula, who, before the declaration of a One Party State, had been leaders of the UPP and ANC political parties respectively, had joined UNIP with the intention of challenging for the Presidency. However, their attempt to challenge President Kaunda for the Presidency on the UNIP ticket failed as both were prevented and disqualified by the manipulations of President Kaunda, who stood unopposed. Simon Kapwepwe and Harry Nkumbula challenged the resultant 1978 election of President Kaunda in the High Court, but unsurprisingly their action was unsuccessful.\nEconomy and the copper crisis.\nAfter independence, Zambia adopted a left-wing economic policy. The economy was, to some extent, run by central planning under five year plans. Private companies were nationalised and incorporated into large state-owned conglomerates. The government's goal was to be self-sufficient, which it sought to achieve through import substitution. At first, the plan worked and the economy grew steadily. However, in the mid-1970s, the economy started to decline drastically. During the period between 1975 and 1990 Zambia's economy dropped by approximately 30%.\nTo deal with the crisis, Zambia took big loans from the International Monetary Fund and the Worldbank hoping that copper prices would rise again soon, instead of issuing structural reforms.\nForeign policy.\nInternationally, Zambia's sympathies lay with forces opposing colonial or white-dominated rule. During the next decade, it actively supported movements such as the National Unions for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) under the independence war and under the subsequent civil war, the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) in Southern Rhodesia, and the African National Congress (ANC) in their struggle against apartheid in the Republic of South Africa, and the South-West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) in their struggle for independence for Namibia. Zambia also hosted some of the movements. For instance, the ANC exile headquarters were in Lusaka, and ZAPU had a military base in Zambia. This resulted in security problems, as the South Africa and South Rhodesia raided targets inside Zambia on several occasions.\nRhodesian counterinsurgency operations extended into Zambia after Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA) rebels shot down two unarmed Vickers Viscount civilian airliners (Air Rhodesia Flight 825 on 3 September 1978 and Air Rhodesia Flight 827 on 12 February 1979) with Soviet-supplied SA-7 heat-seeking missiles. In retaliation for the shooting down of Flight 825 in September 1978, the Rhodesian Air Force attacked the ZIPRA guerrilla base at Westlands farm near Lusaka in October 1978, warning Zambian forces by radio not to interfere.\nConflicts with Rhodesia resulted in the closing of Zambia's borders with that country and severe problems with international transport and power supply. However, the Kariba hydroelectric station on the Zambezi River provided sufficient capacity to satisfy the country's requirements for electricity. TAZARA, a railway to the Tanzanian port of Dar es Salaam, built with Chinese assistance, reduced Zambian dependence on the railway line south to South Africa and west through an increasingly war-ravaged Angola.\nCivil strife in neighbouring Mozambique and Angola created large numbers of refugees, many of whom fled to Zambia.\nInternationally, Zambia was an active member of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), and hosted a summit in Lusaka in 1970. Kenneth Kaunda served as the movements chairman 1970\u20131973. Among the NAM countries Zambia was especially close to Yugoslavia. Outside the NAM Zambia also had close relations with the People's Republic of China.\nIn the Second Congo War, Zambia backed Zimbabwe and the Congo but did not participate as a belligerent.\nMulti-party democracy.\nEnd of one-party rule.\nOne party rule and the declining economy created disappointment among the people. Several strikes hit the country in 1981. The government responded by arresting several union leaders, among them Frederick Chiluba. In 1986 and 1987, protests arose again in Lusaka and the Copperbelt. These were followed by riots over rising food prices in 1990, in which at least 30 people were killed. The same year, the state owned radio claimed that Kaunda had been removed from office by the army. This was not true, and the 1990 Zambian coup d'\u00e9tat attempt failed.\nThese extensive protests made Kaunda realise the need for reform. He promised a referendum on multiparty democracy, and lifted the ban on political parties. This resulted in the quick formation of eleven new parties. Among these Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD), led by former union leader Frederick Chiluba, was the most important. After pressure for the new parties the referendum was canceled in favour of direct multiparty election.\nFrederick Chiluba and the MMD.\nAfter a new constitution had been drafted, elections were held in 1991. They were generally regarded to have been free and fair, and Chiluba won 76% of the presidential vote, and the MMD 125 of the 150 seats in the National Assembly, with UNIP taking the remaining 25.\nEconomically, Chiluba, despite being a former union leader, stood to the right of Kaunda. With support from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, to which Zambia was heavily indebted, he liberalised the economy by restricting government interference, re-privatising state-owned enterprises, such as the important copper mining industry, and removing subsidies on various commodities, most notably on corn meal.\nWhen one party rule was first abolished in 1991, many expected a more democratic future for Zambia. These expectations were, however, clouded by the MMD's treatment of the opposition. Questionable amendments of the constitution and detentions of political opponents caused major criticism, and some donor countries, i.e., the United Kingdom and Denmark, withdrew their aid.\nCoups and emergencies.\nIn 1993, the government-owned newspaper, \"The Times of Zambia,\" reported a story about a secret UNIP plan to take control of government by unconstitutional means, called the \"Zero Option Plan\". The plan included industrial unrest, promotion of violence and organisations of mass protests. UNIP did not deny the existence of such a plan, but underlined that it was not a part of their official policy, but the views of extremists within the party. The government responded by declaring a state of emergency and putting 26 people into detention. Of these, seven, including Kenneth Kaunda's son Wezi Kaunda were charged with offences against the security of the state. The rest were released.\nPrior to the 1996 elections, UNIP formed an alliance with six other opposition parties. Kenneth Kaunda had earlier retired from politics, but after internal turbulence in the party due to the \"Zero Option Plan\" scandal, he returned, replacing his own successor Kebby Musokotwane. Chiluba's government then amended the constitution, banning people whose parents were not both Zambian citizens from becoming president. This was directly aimed at Kaunda, whose parents were both from Malawi. In protest UNIP and its allies boycotted the elections, which were then easily won by Chiluba and the MMD.\nIn 1997, matters escalated. On 28 October a coup d'\u00e9tat attempt took place, as a group of army commanders took control over the national radio station, broadcasting a message stating that Chiluba was no longer president. The coup was brought to an end by regular forces, after Chiluba had again declared a state of emergency. One person was killed during the operation. After the failed coup, the police arrested at least 84 people accused of involvement. Among these were Kenneth Kaunda and Dean Mungomba, leader of the opposition party the Zambia Democratic Congress. The arrests were condemned and criticised as illegal inside as well as outside Zambia, and accusations of torture were made as well. Kaunda was released in June the following year, but 54 of the soldiers who took part in the coup were convicted and sentenced to death The sentence was appealed to Zambia's supreme court in 2003, which commuted the death sentence for ten soldiers but upheld the death sentence for the other 44. However in 2004, Zambia's president Levy Mwanawasa commuted the death sentence for 22 of the coup plotters and released 14 of them as having served their prison sentence. One of the coup leaders, Jack Chiti, was also released on humanitarian grounds due to cancer.\n2001 elections.\nPrior to the elections in 2001, Chiluba tried to change the constitution to allow him to run for a third term. He was forced to step back on this point after protest from within the party as well as from the Zambian public. He attempted to alter the constitution to allow him to run for a third term in office in 2001, but stood down after huge public protests. His successor was Levy Patrick Mwanawasa.\nAfter 2008.\nFrom 2011 to 2014, Zambia's president had been Michael Sata, until Sata died on 28 October 2014. He was the second Zambian leader to die in office after Levy Mwanawasa in 2008. Rupiah Banda was the president of Zambia after the death of Mwanawasa from 2008 to 2011. He lost the election to Michael Sata in 2011.\nAfter Sata's death, Vice President Guy Scott, a Zambian of Scottish descent, became acting President of Zambia. On 24 January 2015, it was announced that Edgar Chagwa Lungu had won the election to become the 6th President in a tightly contested race. In August 2016 Zambian general election, president Edgar Lungu won re-election narrowly in the first round of the election. The opposition had allegations of fraud and the governing Patriotic Front (PF) rejected the allegations made by opposition UPND party.\nIn August 2021 presidential election, opposition leader Hakainde Hichilema defeated the incumbent, President Edgar Lungu, by a landslide. On 24 August 2021, Hakainde Hichilema was sworn in as the new President of Zambia.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

There is a rainy season that runs from October/November to March/April.\nTerrain.\nThe terrain of Zambia is mostly high plateau, with some hills and mountains. The lowest point is the Zambezi river, at above sea level, with the highest being Mafinga Central in the Mafinga Hills, at above sea level. \nZambia is a landlocked country bordered along Zimbabwe in the south divided by Victoria Falls, Congo DR in the north, Tanzania on the northeast, Malawi on the east and Mozambique on the southeast. The general topography of the country is characterized by uplifted planation surfaces. The general elevation of the nation as a whole is tended towards west to east from the Kalahari Basin. The level of land falls from the upper Congo towards the Zambezi depression in the South forming a plateau.\nZambia lies in the watershed between DR Congo and Zambezi river systems. Leaving two provinces, all other provinces lie in the country frontier formed between the continental divide separating the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean, which traverses from DR Congo to the south of Tanzania. There are three major seasons: a cool dry season from April to August, a hot dry season from August to November and a warm wet season from November to April. The maximum heat is experienced during November, while the maximum rainfall is received during December. The annual rainfall is more than in the Southern parts, while is more than in the northern parts. Lake Kariba is the man made lake in Africa and the second largest man made lake in the world and it stretches along the Southern border of the province.\nEcoregions.\nNine ecoregions in four biomes are represented in Zambia, the most widespread being Miombo, Mopane and Baikiaea woodland savanna, with grasslands (mainly flooded grassland) and evergreen forest also present.\nLand use.\nThe following table describes the land use in Zambia, as of 2011.\nAs of 2005, 1559\u00a0km2 of land in Zambia is irrigated.\nEnvironment.\nCurrent issues for the environment in the country include: air pollution and resulting acid rain in the mineral extraction and refining region; chemical runoff into watersheds; poaching, which seriously threatens: rhinoceros, elephant, antelope, and large cat populations; deforestation; soil erosion; desertification and lack of adequate water treatment, which presents human health risks.\nZambia is considered to be vulnerable to climate change. The main impact pathway of climate change in the country is through increasing variability in rainfall amounts during the agricultural season across the various agroecological regions, and shifts in the duration of the rainy season. Zambia is considered vulnerable to the impacts of climate change because the majority of the population rely on agriculture for their livelihoods - and changes in rainfall patterns has a negative impact due to the rainfed nature of production. Researched evidence suggested that temperature was likely to increase by 1.82\u00b0C and rainfall reduce by 0.87 percentage points by 2050. This means that the occurrence of extreme climate events such as droughts and floods would become more frequent.\nZambia is party to the following international agreements: Biodiversity, Climate Change, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Nuclear Test Ban, Ozone Layer Protection and Wetlands. Zambia has signed, but not ratified, the Kyoto Protocol.\nExtreme points.\nThis is a list of the extreme points of Zambia, the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Zambia's high fertility rate continues to drive rapid population growth, averaging almost 3 percent annually between 2000 and 2010. The country's total fertility rate has fallen by less than 1.5 children per woman during the last 30 years and still averages among the world's highest, almost 6 children per woman, largely because of the country's lack of access to family planning services, education for girls, and employment for women. Zambia also exhibits wide fertility disparities based on rural or urban location, education, and income. Poor, uneducated women from rural areas are more likely to marry young, to give birth early, and to have more children, viewing children as a sign of prestige and recognizing that not all of their children will live to adulthood.\nPopulation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAccording to the total population of Zambia is in , compared to only 2,340,000 in 1950.

Zambia's population comprises more than 72 Bantu-speaking ethnic groups. Some ethnic groups are small, and only two have enough people to constitute at least 10% of the population. The majority of Zambians are subsistence farmers, but the country is also fairly urbanised, with 42% of the population being city residents. The predominant religion is a blend of traditional beliefs and Christianity.\nImmigrants, mostly British or South African, as well as some white Zambian citizens (about 40,000 in 2014), live mainly in Lusaka and in the Copperbelt in northern Zambia, where they are either employed in mines, financial and related activities or retired.

{"id": "34432", "revid": "37482880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34432", "title": "Politics of Zambia", "text": "The politics of Zambia takes place in a framework of a presidential representative democratic republic, whereby the president of Zambia is head of state, head of government and leader of a multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government, while legislative power is vested in both the government and parliament. Formerly Northern Rhodesia, Zambia became a republic immediately upon attaining independence in October 1964.\nZambia was democratic from independence to 1973. Zambia was a one-party state from 8 December 1972 until multi-party democracy was re-introduced on 4 December 1990 which led to multi-party elections on 1 November 1991. Since then, Zambia has been a relatively stable democracy having consistently peacefully transferred power between four political parties (UNIP, MMD, PF and UPND) and has since 1991 held nine presidential elections, of which seven were general elections.\nZambia has undergone democratic backsliding since 2011. The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) rated Zambia as a hybrid regime in 2020. The EIU has also consistently put Zambia among the top ten most democratic African countries, ranking it 8th in Africa and 99th in the world as of 2018 (167 states). This is also while Freedom House ranks Zambia as \u2018Partly Free\u2019, with a score of 52/100 (0 least free and 100 mostly free) as of 2021.\nGovernment and constitution.\nThe constitution promulgated on 25 August 1973, abrogated the original 1964 constitution. The new constitution and the national elections that followed in December 1973 were the final steps in achieving what was called a \"one-party participatory democracy\".\nThe 1973 constitution provided for a strong president and a unicameral National Assembly. National policy was formulated by the Central Committee of the United National Independence Party (UNIP), the sole legal party in Zambia. The cabinet executed the central committee's policy.\nIn accordance with the intention to formalise UNIP supremacy in the new system, the constitution stipulated that the sole candidate in elections for the office of president was the person selected to be the president of UNIP by the party's general conference. The second-ranking person in the Zambian hierarchy was UNIP's secretary-general.\nIn December 1990, at the end of a tumultuous year that included riots in the capital and an attempted coup, President Kaunda signed legislation ending UNIP's monopoly on power. In response to growing popular demand for multiparty democracy, and after lengthy, difficult negotiations between the Kaunda government and opposition groups, Zambia enacted a new constitution in August 1991. The constitution enlarged the National Assembly from 136 members to a maximum of 158 members, established an electoral commission, and allowed for more than one presidential candidate who no longer had to be a member of UNIP. The constitution was amended again in 1996 to set new limits on the presidency (including a retroactive two-term limit, and a requirement that both parents of a candidate be Zambian-born). The National Assembly comprises 150 directly elected members, up to ten (usually eight) presidentially appointed members, and a speaker. Zambia is divided into ten provinces, each administered by an appointed Provincial minister who essentially performs the duties of a governor.\nAs of 2010, a new constitution is in the process of being drafted.\nPolitical history.\nThe major figure in Zambian politics from 1964 to 1991 was Kenneth Kaunda, who led the fight for independence and successfully bridged the rivalries among the country's various regions and ethnic groups. Kaunda tried to base government on his philosophy of \"humanism\", which condemned human exploitation and stressed cooperation among people, but not at the expense of the individual. During Kaunda's presidency, members of all ethnic groups were represented by ministers in the government, in relation to their demographic size.\nZambia conducted three democratic elections (1962, 1964, and 1968) after achieving independence. The elections were marred by violence and irregularities, but all parties respected the election results.\nBefore 1972, Zambia had three significant political parties: the United National Independence Party (UNIP), the African National Congress (ANC), and the United Progressive Party (UPP). The ANC drew its strength from the western and southern provinces, while the UPP found some support among Bemba speakers in the Copperbelt and northern provinces. Although not strongly supported in all areas of the country, only UNIP had a nationwide following.\nOne-party state.\nIn February 1972, Zambia became a one-party state, and all other political parties were banned. Kenneth Kaunda, the sole candidate, was elected president in the 1973 elections. Elections also were held for the National Assembly. Only UNIP members were permitted to run, but these seats were sharply contested. President Kaunda's mandate was renewed in December 1978 and October 1983 in a \"yes\" or \"no\" vote on his candidacy. In the 1983 election, more than 60% of those registered participated and gave President Kaunda a 95.38% \"yes\" vote.\n1991: Move to a multiparty state.\nGrowing opposition to UNIP's monopoly on power led to the rise in 1990 of the Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD). The MMD assembled an increasingly impressive group of important Zambians, including prominent UNIP defectors and labour leaders. During the year, President Kaunda agreed to a referendum on the one-party state but, in the face of continued opposition, dropped the referendum and signed a constitutional amendment making Zambia a multi-party state. Zambia's first multi-party elections for parliament and the presidency since the 1960s were held on 31 October 1991. MMD candidate Frederick Chiluba resoundingly carried the presidential election over Kenneth Kaunda with 76% of the vote. To add to the MMD landslide, in the parliamentary elections the MMD won 125 of the 150 elected seats and UNIP the remaining 25. However, UNIP swept the Eastern Province, gathering 19 of its seats there.\n1991\u20132001: MMD and Frederick Chiluba.\nBy the end of Chiluba's first term as president (1996), the MMD's commitment to political reform had faded in the face of re-election demands. A number of prominent supporters founded opposing parties. Relying on the MMD's overwhelming majority in parliament, President Chiluba in May 1996 pushed through constitutional amendments that eliminated former President Kaunda and other prominent opposition leaders from the 1996 presidential elections.\nIn the presidential and parliamentary elections held in November 1996, Chiluba was re-elected, and the MMD won 131 of the 150 seats in the National Assembly. Kaunda's UNIP party boycotted the parliamentary polls to protest the exclusion of its leader from the presidential race, alleging in addition that the outcome of the election had been predetermined due to a faulty voter registration exercise. Despite the UNIP boycott, the elections took place peacefully, and five presidential and more than 600 parliamentary candidates from 11 parties participated. Afterward, however, several opposition parties and non-governmental organisations declared the elections neither free nor fair. As President Chiluba began his second term in 1997, the opposition continued to reject the results of the election amid international efforts to encourage the MMD and the opposition to resolve their differences through dialogue.\nEarly in 2001, supporters of President Chiluba mounted a campaign to amend the constitution to enable Chiluba to seek a third term of office. Civil society, opposition parties, and many members of the ruling party complimented widespread popular opposition to exert sufficient pressure on Chiluba to force him to back away from any attempt at a third term.\nPresidential, parliamentary, and local government elections were held on 27 December 2001. Eleven parties contested the elections. The elections encountered numerous administrative problems. Opposition parties alleged that serious irregularities occurred. Nevertheless, MMD presidential candidate Levy Mwanawasa was declared the victor by a narrow margin, and he was sworn into office on 2 January 2002. Three parties submitted petitions to the High Court, challenging the presidential election results. The courts decided that there had been irregularities but that they were not serious enough to have affected the overall result, thus the election result was upheld. Opposition parties won a majority of parliamentary seats in the December, 2001 election, but subsequent by-elections gave the ruling MMD a slim majority in Parliament.\n2001\u20132008.\nIn the 2006 presidential election was hotly contested, with Mwanawasa being re-elected by a clear margin over principal challengers Michael Sata of the Patriotic Front and Hakainde Hichilema of the United Party for National Development (UPND).\nThe parliamentary election that same year awarded MMD with 72 seats, the remaining 84 seats split among other parties with the majority of those seats going to the Patriotic Front.\nThe presidency of Levy Mwanawasa until his death in office in mid-2008, was different from the flamboyant expenditure and increasingly apparent corruption of the later years of Frederick Chiluba's terms in office. Indeed, the former president was arrested and charged with several counts of embezzlement and corruption, firmly quashing initial fears that President Mwanawasa would turn a blind eye to the allegations of his predecessor's improprieties.\nMwanawasa was accused by some observers of demonstrating an authoritarian streak in early 2004 when his Minister of Home Affairs issued a deportation order to a British citizen and long-time Zambian resident Roy Clarke, who had published a series of satirical attacks on the president in the independent Post newspaper. However, when Clarke appealed to the High Court against the order, the judge ruled that the order was arbitrary and unjustified and quashed the order. President Mwanawasa, true to his mantra of heading a government of laws, respected the court decision and Clarke was allowed to resume his column of satirical critique. Mwanawasa's early zeal to root out corruption also waned somewhat, with key witnesses in the Chiluba trial leaving the country. The Constitutional Review Commission set up by Mwanawasa also hit some turbulence, with arguments as to where its findings should be submitted leading to suspicions that he has been trying to manipulate the outcome. Generally, the Zambian electorate viewed Mwanawasa's rule as a great improvement over Chiluba's.\nFollowing Mwanawasa's death in August 2008, Zambian vice-president Rupiah Banda succeeded him to the office of president, to be held as a temporary position until the emergency election on 30 October 2008. Banda won by a narrow margin over opposition leader Michael Sata, to complete the remainder of Mwanawasa's term.\n2011 elections.\nRupiah Banda failed to be re-elected in the 2011 Presidential and Parliamentary elections, losing to Michael Sata of the Patriotic Front. This brought an end to a total of 20 years' rule by three presidents from the MMD.\n2015\u2013present.\nEdgar Chagwa Lungu was sworn in as president of Zambia on 25 January 2015, succeeding acting-president Guy Scott who briefly held the office after the passing of Michael Chiluyfa Sata. Lungu's presidency has thus far been criticised for failing to halt the depreciating Kwacha. There have also been unsubstantiated reports of Lungu's alleged alcoholism, stemming from a reported physical collapse early in his presidency. The economic challenges facing Zambia, in particular the depreciating Kwacha, have been attributed to the global fall of commodity prices. Zambia derives over 90% of its export earnings from a single commodity, copper, which has lost about 45% of its value on the international commodity market.\nOn 5 January 2016, Lungu successfully concluded long-standing constitutional issues when he assented to the 2015 Constitutional Amendment Bill. This bill is the result of extensive work begun during the Mwanawasa era (The Mwanakatwe Commission) and continued by the Michael Chilufya Sata appointed Technical Committee. As justice minister, Lungu had previously presented the draft constitution to parliament, where it was subsequently decided that non-contentious issues will be debated in parliament and contentious issues will be subject to a referendum. In the August 2016 Zambian general election, President Edgar Lungu won re-election narrowly in the first round of the election. The opposition had allegations of fraud and the governing Patriotic Front (PF) rejected the allegations made by opposition UPND party. However, in 2020 the Parliament through the office of the justice minister (Given Lubinda) proposed a bill called Bill 10, which was rejected in Parliament on its third reading.\nIn the 2021 general elections, characterised by a 70% voter turnout, Hakainde Hichilema won 59% of the vote, with his closest rival, incumbent president Edgar Chagwa Lungu, receiving 39% of the vote. On 16 August Edgar Lungu conceded in a TV statement, sending a letter and congratulating president-elect Hakainde Hichilema. On 24 August 2021, Hakainde Hichilema was sworn in as the new President of Zambia.\nExecutive branch.\nThe executive branch of the Zambian government is vested in the president who is elected in a two round system. Presidents serve terms of five years and are limited to two terms.\nPrior to the 2016 Constitutional Amendment the Zambian vice-president was appointed by the president, but the current 2016 amendment puts the vice-president on the same electoral ticket as the president (running mate) (Article 110 Sec 2, 3 and 4) and in the event of a vacancy of an elected president the vice-president is the immediate successor to the president and remains president until the next general election (Article 106 Sec 5(a) and Sec 6). This is in contrast to the 1996 constitution that required a by-election within 90 days of an elected president's vacancy with the vice-president acting as an interim (as was the case with former Acting-President Guy Scott in October 2014 to January 2015 and former President Rupiah Banda in 2008 after the deaths of Presidents Sata and Mwanawasa respectively).\nThe presidency is currently filled by Hakainde Hichilema with Mutale Nalumango as vice-president since 2021.\nLegislative branch.\nThe unicameral National Assembly of Zambia is the country's legislative body. The current National Assembly, formed following elections held on 12 August 2021, has a total of 167 members. 156 members are directly elected in single-member constituencies using the simple majority (or First-past-the-post) system. 8 seats are filled through presidential appointment, and 3 seats are held by ex-officio members: the Vice President, the Speaker and one Deputy Speaker. All members serve five-year terms.\nJudicial branch.\nThe Supreme Court is the highest court and the court of appeal; below it are the high court, magistrate's court, and local courts. A separate Constitutional Court was established in 2016.\nMilitary.\nThe Zambian Defense Force (ZDF) consists of the army, the air force, and the Zambian National Service (ZNS). The ZDF is designed primarily for external defence. The Zambian Police force is not part of the defence force, it was established for internal security services and is under the ministry of home affairs.\nForeign relations.\nZambia is a member of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), the Commonwealth, the African Union (and its predecessor the Organization of African Unity or OAU), the Southern African Development Community (SADC), and the Common Market for Africa (COMA), which is headquartered in Lusaka.\nPresident Kaunda was a persistent and visible advocate of change in Southern Africa, supporting liberation movements in Mozambique, Namibia, Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe), and South Africa. Many of these organisations were based in Zambia during the 1970s and 1980s.\nPresident Chiluba assumed a somewhat higher profile internationally in the mid- and late 1990s. His government played a constructive regional role sponsoring Angola peace talks that led to the 1994 Lusaka Protocols. Zambia has provided troops to UN peacekeeping initiatives in Mozambique, Rwanda, Angola, and Sierra Leone. Zambia was the first African state to cooperate with the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda into the Rwandan genocide in 1994.\nIn 1998, Zambia took the lead in efforts to establish a cease-fire in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Zambia was active in the Congolese peace effort after the signing of a cease-fire agreement in Lusaka in July and August 1999, although activity diminished considerably after the Joint Military Commission tasked with implementing the ceasefire relocated to Kinshasa in September 2001.\nZambia is also a member of the International Criminal Court with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the US-military (as covered under Article 98).\nParticipation in international organisations.\nZambia is a member of ACP, AfDB, COMESA, ECA, FAO, G-19, G-77, IAEA, IBRD, ICAO, ICCt, ICFTU, ICRM, IDA, IFAD, IFC, IFRCS, ILO, IMF, Interpol, IOC, IOM, ITU, MONUC, NAM, OAU, OPCW, PCA, SADC, UN, UNAMSIL, UNCTAD, UNESCO, UNIDO, UNMEE, UNMIK, UPU, WCL, WCO, WHO, WIPO, WMO, WToO and the WTO.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Through the first decade of the 21st century, the economy of Zambia was one of the fastest-growing economies in Africa, and its capital, Lusaka, the fastest-growing city in the Southern African Development Community (SADC). Zambia's economic performance has stalled in recent years due to declining copper prices, significant fiscal deficits, and energy shortages. The economy has been reliant on mineral extraction since the 1920s, in particular copper.\nUpon achieving independence, Zambia had a higher GDP per capita than almost all sub-Saharan African countries. Over the subsequent decades, Zambia's economy contracted, in part due to declining copper prices. Since the 2000s, Zambia's economy has been growing. As of 2019, Zambia's GDP per capita (current international dollars) stands at $1,305.00.\nZambia is one of Sub-Saharan Africa's most urbanized countries. About one-half of the country's 16 million people are concentrated in a few urban zones strung along the major transportation corridors, while rural areas are under-populated. \nCopper and cobalt are among Zambia's main exports, while non-traditional exports include cotton, coffee, fresh flowers, burley tobacco, gemstones and maize (corn). Zambia is eligible to export duty-free goods to the United States under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA); the Act allows eligible countries from sub-Saharan Africa to export over 6,400 goods to the United States.\nCopper output has increased steadily since 2004, due to higher copper prices and the opening of new mines. The maize harvest was again good in 2005, helping boost GDP and agricultural exports. Cooperation continues with international bodies on programs to reduce poverty, including a new lending arrangement with the IMF in the second quarter of 2004.\nHistory.\nEconomic policies soon after independence (1964\u20131967).\nThe British South Africa Company (BSAC, originally set up by the British imperialist Cecil Rhodes) retained commercial assets and mineral rights that it acquired from a concession signed with the Litunga of Barotseland in 1892 (the Lochner Concession). Only by threatening to expropriate the BSAC, on the eve of independence, did the incoming Zambian government manage to get the BSAC to relinquish the mineral rights. The Federation's government assigned roles to each of the three territories: Southern Rhodesia was assigned the responsibility of providing managerial and administrative skills; Northern Rhodesia provided copper revenues; and Nyasaland provided the Black labour.\nAfter independence, Zambia instituted a program of national development plans, under the direction of a National Commission for Development Planning: the Transitional Development Plan (1964\u201366) was followed by the First National Development Plan (1966\u201371). These two plans, which provided for major investment in infrastructure and manufacturing, were largely implemented and were generally successful. This was not true for subsequent plans.\nThe Mulungushi Economic Reforms (1968).\nA major switch in the structure of Zambia's economy came with the Mulungushi Reforms of April 1968: the government declared its intention to acquire equity holdings (usually 51% or more) in a number of key foreign-owned firms, to be controlled by a parastatal conglomerate named the Industrial Development Corporation (INDECO). By January 1970, Zambia had acquired majority holding in the Zambian operations of the two major foreign mining corporations, the Anglo American Corporation and the Rhodesia Selection Trust (RST); the two became the Nchanga Consolidated Copper Mines (NCCM) and Roan Consolidated Mines (RCM), respectively. The Zambian government then created a new parastatal body, the Mining Development Corporation (MINDECO). The Finance and Development Corporation (FINDECO) allowed the Zambian government to gain control of insurance companies and building societies. However, foreign-owned banks (such as Barclays, Standard Chartered and Grindlays) successfully resisted takeover. In 1971, INDECO, MINDECO, and FINDECO were brought together under an omnibus parastatal, the Zambia Industrial and Mining Corporation (ZIMCO), to create one of the largest companies in sub-Saharan Africa, with the country's president, Kenneth Kaunda as chairman of the board. The management contracts under which day-to-day operations of the mines had been carried out by Anglo American and RST were ended in 1973. In 1982 NCCM and RCM were merged into the giant Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines Ltd (ZCCM).\nIn 1973 a massive increase in the price of oil was followed by a slump in copper prices in 1975, resulting in a diminution of export earnings. In 1973 the price of copper accounted for 95% of all export earnings; this halved in value on the world market in 1975. By 1976 Zambia had a balance-of-payments crisis, and rapidly became massively indebted to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The Third National Development Plan (1978\u201383) had to be abandoned as crisis management replaced long-term planning.\nBy the mid-1980s Zambia was one of the most indebted nations in the world, relative to its gross domestic product (GDP). The IMF was insisting that the Zambian government should introduce programs aimed at stabilizing the economy and restructuring it to reduce dependence on copper. The proposed measures included: the ending of price controls; devaluation of the kwacha (Zambia's currency); cut-backs in government expenditure; cancellation of subsidies on food and fertilizer; and increased prices for farm produce. Kaunda's removal of food subsidies caused massive increases in the prices of basic foodstuffs; the country's urbanized population rioted in protest. In desperation, Kaunda broke with the IMF in May 1987 and introduced a New Economic Recovery Programme in 1988. However, this did not help him and he eventually moved toward a new understanding with the IMF in 1989. In 1990 Kaunda was forced to make a major policy about-face: he announced the intention to partially privatize the parastatals. Time, however, was running out for him. Like many African independence leaders Kaunda tried to hang on to power but unlike many he called multiparty elections and lost them to the Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) and abided by the results. Kaunda left office with the inauguration of MMD leader Frederick Chiluba as president on 2 November 1991.\nChiluba's economic reforms (1991\u20132000).\nZambia's Economic System of Government is Unitary because of that the Frederick Chiluba government (1991\u20132001), which came to power after democratic multi-party elections in November 1991, was committed to extensive economic reform.\nZambia's economic transformation into a free market system began toward the end of 1991 following a change of government. To tackle a serious economic crisis, the government agreed to introduce substantial economic reforms to secure much-needed loans from the World Bank and IMF.\nOne of the greatest challenges was the privatization of the country's copper mines, Zambia's prime export earner. The government privatised many state industries, and maintained positive real interest rates. Exchange controls were eliminated and free market principles endorsed. It remains to be seen whether the Mwanawasa government will follow a similar path of implementing economic reform and undertaking further privatization. Zambia has yet to address issues such as reducing the size of the public sector, which still represents 44% of total formal employment, and improving Zambia's social sector delivery systems.\nAfter the government privatized the giant parastatal mining company Zambian Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), donors resumed balance-of-payment support. The final transfer of ZCCM's assets occurred on March 31, 2000. Although balance-of-payment payments are not the answer to Zambia's long-term debt problems, it will in the short term provide the government some breathing room to implement further economic reforms. The government has, however, spent much of its foreign exchange reserves to intervene in the exchange rate mechanism. To continue to do so, however, would jeopardize Zambia's debt relief. Zambia qualified for HIPC debt relief in 2000, contingent upon the country meeting certain performance criteria, and this should offer a long-term solution to Zambia's debt situation.\n2001\u20132010.\nOn 2 January 2002, MMD's Levy Mwanawasa won the presidential election which many observers claimed had actually been won by the opposition. In January 2003, the Zambian Government informed the International Monetary Fund and World Bank that it wished to renegotiate some of the agreed performance criteria calling for privatization of the Zambia National Commercial Bank and the national telephone and electricity utilities.\nForeign investors liked Mwanawasa, owing partly to his anti-corruption drive. During his presidency, Zambia received foreign investment. The main driver of economic growth was minerals. Mwanawasa's policies helped to lower inflation to single digits in 2006, a record the country had not seen in over 25 years, and spread some benefits to the poor. Tourists and white farmers diverted from Zimbabwe and helped the Zambian economy. The policies turned the Zambian town of Livingstone, near Victoria Falls, into a tourist hub. Zambia received a relatively large amount of aid and debt relief because of liberalisation and Mwanawasa's efforts. Overall, economic growth increased to about 6% per year.\nAfter Mwanawasa suffered a stroke while attending an African Union summit in Egypt on 29 June 2008, Rupiah Banda became acting president and subsequently President. With divisions within the MMD, Banda promised to \"unite the party and the entire nation\" and to \"continue implementing [Mwanawasa's] programs\". After taking office, however, Banda dismantled much of the anti-corruption effort put into place by his predecessor, Mwanawasa. This, compounded with the effects of the Great Recession, led to a sustained period of increased inflation.\n2011\u20132020.\nIn September 2011, the social democrat, Michael Sata led the Patriotic Front (PF) to victory with a vow to improve conditions for their Zambian employees. Though known to previously oppose Chinese investment, he declared his change in perspective prior to his election victory. Sata died on 28 October 2014 and was succeeded by Edgar Lungu. The period, saw an infrastructure boom with the development of the Kafue Gorge Lower Power Station, two multi-purpose stadiums, Levy Mwanawasa Stadium and National Heroes Stadium, expansions of the Kenneth Kaunda International Airport, the Harry Mwanga Nkumbula International Airport and the Simon Mwansa Kapwepwe International Airport, and the Pave Zambia 2000 project intended to create and repair major urban roads countrywide.\nUnfortunately this came at a huge debt cost that slowed the economy and compounded by corruption and the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in weak GDP growth and a recession in 2019 and 2020 respectively. Zambia's GDP had shrunk from US$29 billion to US$19 billion and its debt grew from 16% to 140% of GDP from 2010 through 2020. In November 2020, Zambia became Africa's first coronavirus-era default when it opted to bow out of a US$42.5 million eurobond repayment.\nFrom 2021.\nIn August 2021, the Zambian populace ushered in a new government with a promise for jobs growth. Hakainde Hichilema's United Party for National Development (UPND) government delivered an ambitious budget that included an increase in the Constituency Development Fund (CDF) from ZMW 1.6 million (US$91 thousand) to ZMW 25.7 million (US$1.5 million) for each of Zambia's 156 constituencies and its decentralization in release to these constituencies. The expectation is that this will generate jobs growth in addition to the government's targeted employment of 30,000 new teachers and 11,200 health workers. In mid July 2022, the government recruited 30,496 Teachers. At the end of July 2022, 11,276 health workers, being doctors, nurses and ancillary staff such as drivers were recruited by the government.\nWith a push for Zambia to be able to produce 3 million tonnes of Copper per annum within the next 10 years, the government reintroduced the deductibility of mineral royalty for corporate income tax assessment purposes. The results of these policy changes are yet to be seen.\nAt the 2022 IMF-World Bank Spring Meetings, the World Bank announced it would fund projects worth US$560 million in Zambia in 2022.\nIn July 2022, to address its debt challenges, the Zambian government engaged creditors of undisbursed loans to facilitate the formal cancellation of loans estimated to be about US$2.0 billion. Projects that were already ongoing would now be financed through government revenues.\nIn early August 2022, the Zambia Development Agency, a quasi-government institution under the Ministry of Commerce, Trade and Industry reported that it had recorded numerous investment pledges worth US$3.8 billion in the first half to 2022 targeting the agriculture, tourism, construction and mining sectors with a potential job market of 19,000.\nIn October 2021, to spur economic development, Zambia took measures to promote local development in its ambitious 2022 national budget. The Government announced an unprecedented constituency development fund (CDF) increment from ZMW 1.6 million (U$91,000) to ZMW 25.7 million (U$1.5million) for each constituency taking the total development fund injection into the local communities from ZMW 250 million (U$14.2 million) to ZMW 4 billion (U$228.4 million). After winning a crucial Staff-Level IMF Deal, in early December 2021, Zambia went on to cut fuel subsidies later that month as a key step in seeking U$1.4 billion from the IMF.\nAt the end of July 2022, the Official Creditor Committee co-chaired by China and France, and vice chaired by South Africa agreed to provide the financing assurances under the G20 Common Framework for debt treatment that Zambia had been waiting for to secure final approval from the International Monetary Fund for a US$1.4 billion bailout under the Extended Credit Facility. In early August 2022, at the symposium on the midyear budget and economic performance and the 2023 to 2025 medium term budget plan, Zambia's Minister of Finance and National Planning, Dr. Situmbeko Musokotwane said the IMF board was expected to meet at the end of August 2022 to approve the loan programme.\nOn 31 August 2022, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) board approved a US$1.3 billion extended credit facility to help Zambia restore fiscal stability.\nIn June 2023, Zambia reached an agreement in principle to restructure US$6.3 billion of debt with bilateral lenders. In October 2023, Zambia agreed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with its bilateral creditors on restructuring about $6.3 billion of debt. Following the signing of the MoU, the terms would be implemented through bilateral agreements with each member of the OCC (Official Creditor Committee).\nIn March 2024, Zambia struck an 76.5 billion kwacha (US$3.0 billion) restructuring deal with bondholders. The agreement included important concessions from the Bondholders, while providing the required debt relief to the Government. Under the agreement, Bondholders would forego approximately 21.4 billion kwacha (US$840 million) of their claims, and provide cash flow relief of approximately 63.8 billion kwacha (US$2.5 billion) during the IMF programme period.\nPublic-Private Dialogue Forum (PPDF).\nIn April 2022, Zambia launched a mechanism aimed at unlocking the potential of the private sector as a driver of economic development and job creation. The Public-Private Dialogue Forum (PPDF) is meant to act as a structured mechanism for interactions between the public and the private sector in tackling bottlenecks that have hindered the growth of the private sector.\nEuropean Union (EU)\u2013Zambia Economic Forum.\nIn May 2022, the inaugural European Union (EU)-Zambia Economic Forum was launched in Lusaka by President Hakainde Hichilema under the theme \u2018Economic transformation through green growth\u2019. It was a high-level event that brought together entrepreneurs, experts, financial institutions, innovators, and policy decision-makers from Zambia, the EU and representatives of its 27 member states. Additional special guests included the EU Commissioner for Agriculture Janusz Wojciechowski and the commissioner for Trade and Industry of the African Union Commission, Albert M. Muchanga. The forum was launched as a platform with a view to promoting employment, value addition and increased trade through business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-government (B2G) collaboration and economic synergies for EU and Zambian businesses.\nUK\u2013Zambia Green Growth Compact.\nIn November 2021, the Zambian and British government signed the UK-Zambia Green Growth Compact, an agreement expected to boost the United Kingdom's investment into Zambia by \u00a3 1.0 billion (US$1.26 billion) with a focus on job creation and green energy production. In May 2022, the British High Commissioner to Zambia Nicholas Woolley, indicated that the British government had set aside the \u00a3 1.0 billion to be spent over the next 5 years with \u00a3 100.0 million (US$126.0 million) targeted for funding Small Medium Entrepreneurs (SMEs) and \u00a3 500.0 million (US$629.9 million) for investment in renewable energy.\nWorld Bank Support.\nIn July 2022, the World Bank approved US$155.0 million in International Development Assistance for Social Cash Transfer to mitigate the high cost of living pressures in Zambia and a further US$27.0 million credit facility to support the government's development programs.\nIn July 2022, the World Bank approved a further US$665.0 million to fund projects in Zambia to spur economic recovery and growth and also lighten the debt burden. Through 2032, the World Bank plans to support Zambia with new financing of over US$2.0 billion in the form of concessional loans.\nIn late October 2022, the World Bank approved US$275.0 million concessional loan targeted at fiscal stabilization and accelerated economic programs. Financing was provided by the World Bank's International Development Association (IDA).\nAfrican Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) Support.\nIn July 2022, the African Export-Import Bank President Benedict Oramah, whilst in Lusaka Zambia, announced that the bank would put up an investment of about US$250 million for Zambia's first-ever Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) manufacturing plant.\nEAC-SADC-COMESA Free Trade Area.\nIn July 2022, during the 4th Mid-Year Coordination Meeting of the African Union, Regional Economic Communities and Regional Mechanisms in Lusaka, Zambia, the three regional blocs, East African Community (EAC), Southern African Development Community (SADC), and Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) agreed to have a tripartite ministers' summit to fast track the finalization of the border control-free travel and free movement of goods and services area by the end of 2022.\nZambia-China Trade and Investment Forum.\nIn September 2022, Zambia and China launched the inaugural trade and investment forum aimed at unlocking trade and investment potential between the two countries. The event also saw the signing of an Exchange Letter of the Duty Free Treatment for Zambian products corresponding to 98-percent of the tariff lines by Finance Minister Situmbeko Musokotwane and Chinese Ambassador to Zambia Du Xiao.\nZambia-China bilateral trade growth.\nIn mid-September 2023, President Hakainde Hichilema met with the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping in Beijing, China where they witnessed the signing of over 15 MOUs amounting to a potential investment of about ZMW 62.3 billion kwacha (US$3.0 billion) by China into Zambia and the leaders also agreed to increase the use of local currencies in trade between the two countries. One of the MOUs signed during Mr. Hichilema's visit to China was with the international telecoms manufacturer ZTE to construct and open a smartphone manufacturing plant in Zambia. In late-September 2023, China Nonferrous Metal Mining Group (CNMC) unveiled plans to inject an additional ZMW 27.0 billion kwacha (US $1.3 billion) into Zambia from 2023 through 2028, spanning the mining, energy, education and technology economic sectors.\nU.S.-Zambia Business Summit.\nIn October 2022, more than 50 United States and Zambian business and government leaders gathered in Lusaka for the two-day inaugural U.S.-Zambia Business Summit at the Intercontinental Hotel. Representatives from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, U.S. International Development Finance Corporation also attended the Summit. The Summit focused on promoting Zambia as one of the most attractive business environments for investment on the African continent.\nAfrican Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Digital Trade Forum\nIn May 2025, Zambia hosted the inaugural, African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Digital Trade Forum in Lusaka. The Digital Trade Forum, bringing together policymakers and business leaders from across Africa, aimed to develop practical strategies for implementing the AfCFTA's digital commerce provisions. \nInvest Zambia International Conference\nIn July 2025, Zambia Launched the inaugural \u201cInvest in Zambia International Conference\u201d to drive Economic transformation.The event saw the signing of multiple MOUs and deals worth over 46.6 billion kwacha (US$ 2 billion) securing significant investments in Zambia's energy and agricultural sectors.\nSectors.\nMining.\nIn 2019, the country was the world's 7th largest producer of copper.\nThe Zambian economy has historically been based on the copper-mining industry. The industrialization of the copper industry is owed partly to Frederick Russell Burnham, the famous American scout who worked for Cecil Rhodes. By 1998, however, output of copper had fallen to a low of 228,000 tonnes, continuing a 30-year decline in output due to lack of investment, and until recently, low copper prices and uncertainty over privatization. In 2001, the first full year of a privatized industry, Zambia recorded its first year of increased productivity since 1973. The future of the copper industry in Zambia was thrown into doubt in January 2002, when investors in Zambia's largest copper mine announced their intention to withdraw their investment. However, surging copper prices from 2004 to the present day rapidly rekindled international interest in Zambia's copper sector with a new buyer found for KCCM and massive investments in expanding capacity launched. China has become a major investor in the Zambian copper industry, and in February 2007, the two countries announced the creation of a Chinese-Zambian economic partnership zone around the Chambishi copper mine.\nToday copper mining is central to the economic prospects for Zambia and covers 85% of all the country's exports, but concerns remain that the economy is not diversified enough to cope with a collapse in international copper prices.\nIn January 2013, the Zambia Environmental Management Agency (ZEMA) approved 27 mining and exploration licences, with more rumoured to be confirmed.\nZambia is the world's second biggest producer of emeralds, with its Kafubu River area deposits (Kagem Mines) about southwest of Kitwe responsible for 20% of the world's production of gem-quality stones in 2004. In the first half of 2011, the Kagem Mines produced 3.74 tons of emeralds. In April 2022, Gemfields, the majority owner in the mine, recorded a record U$42.3 million at a sold out March/April auction and since 2009, Kagem-sourced gemstones (emerald and beryl) have netted Gemfields revenue totaling U$792 million with the proceeds fully repatriated to Kagem in Zambia, with all royalties due to the Zambian government paid on the full sales prices achieved at auctions.\nRich deposits of Uranium have been discovered in some parts of Zambia. In 2007, the Zambian government sought scrutiny and guidance from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on its developed guidelines to regulate the mining of uranium in the country. In 2008, deposits were found in Kaputa District, Northern Province. Albidon Zambia Limited also confirmed the presence of high-grade uranium mineralisation at its Njame east project near Chirundu. In the Southern Province, 31\u00a0km North of Siavonga, and north of Lake Kariba, there are 5 main Uranium Deposits: Mutanga, Dibwe, Dibwe East, Njame, and Gwabe explored under The Mutanga Uranium Project. The Canadian Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) listed GoviEx Uranium Inc acquired 100% of the Mutanga Project also known as the Kariba Uranium Project in 2016. In March 2022, GoviEx announced that the Project is forecast to start production in 2027 and could be the lowest capital intensive uranium project in Africa.\nLumwana Mining Company Limited (LMC) who had embarked on uranium exploration in 2007 in Solwezi District are currently stock piling uranium that the firm is getting as a by-product of Copper from its operations as they are yet to obtain a uranium license. The mining of uranium in Zambia is monitored by the Zambia Environmental Management Agency (ZEMA).\n\"See Also:\"\nAgriculture.\nThe agriculture sector represented 2.7% GDP in 2019. Agriculture accounted for 85% of total employment (formal and informal) for 2000. Maize (corn) is the principal cash crop as well as the staple food. Other important crops include soybean, cotton, sugar, sunflower seeds, wheat, sorghum, pearl millet, cassava, tobacco and various vegetable and fruit crops. Floriculture is a growth sector, and agricultural non-traditional exports now rival the mining industry in foreign exchange receipts. Zambia has the potential for significantly increasing its agricultural output; currently, less than 20% of its arable land is cultivated. In the past, the agriculture sector suffered from low producer prices, difficulties in availability and distribution of credit and inputs, and the shortage of foreign exchange.\nIn 2019 Zambia produced:\nIn addition to other productions of other agricultural products.\nDue to high demand for flour in neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo DRC, Zambia increased Wheat production from 205,000 tonnes in 2020 to 400,000 tonnes 2021.\nIn July 2022, Zambia and China sealed a memorandum of understanding on soya bean meal and stevia export from Zambia to China.\nFisheries and Livestock.\nThe Fisheries and Livestock sub-sector in Zambia contributes to employment creation, food and nutrition security, and economic growth.\nIn livestock, Zambia produced, in 2019: 191 thousand tons of beef; 50 thousand tons of chicken meat; 34 thousand tons of pork; 453 million liters of cow's milk, among others.\nEnergy.\nEnergy in Zambia is the production of energy and electricity, for consumption or export. The Energy Regulation Board (ERB) has the mandate to balance and safeguard the interests of all energy stakeholders. The Energy policy is as guided by the Energy Regulation Act No. 12 of 2019, the Electricity Act No. 11 of 2019 and the Rural Electrification Act No.20 of 2003.\nElectricity.\nIn 2019, Zambia generated a total of 15,013GWh of Energy. 12,427GWh was Renewable and 2,586 GWh was non-renewable. Over 99% of the Renewable energy component was Hydro electricity.\nWith a view to diversifying the power generation profile, Zambia increased its Solar Power generation Capacity in 2019.\nIn March 2019, the 54MW Bangweulu Solar Power Station was commissioned.\nIn May 2019, the 34MW Ngonye Solar Power Station was commissioned.\nIn July 2022, the local National utility ZESCO, announced it had achieved an electricity generation surplus of about 1,156 MW. Zambia's national generation capacity stands at 3,456.8 MW versus a peak national demand of 2,300 MW. The surplus power is to be directed to service the power supply agreements for the export of 180 MW to Namibia and 100 MW to Zimbabwe. The exportation of 100MW electricity to Zimbabwe which is set to commence in August 2022 is under a five-year contract with a condition precedent that ZESCO earns monthly income of US$6.3 million prior exporting to Zimbabwe.\nThe close of 2022 brought in some serious challenges to the Zambian economy, when low water levels at the Kariba Dam significantly impacted the 1080MW Kariba Hydro Power plant's output capacity and resulted in load shedding for businesses and residents across the country. This was compounded by the maintenance that was being carried out at the 300MW Maamba Coilleries Coal Fired Power Plant.\nIn January 2023, Zambia signed a US$2 billion dollar MOU and Joint Development Agreement (JDA) with the United Arab Emirates for the development of 2000MW of Solar Power Projects.\nIn April 2023, Zambia, through its state owned utility company ZESCO Limited, signed a ZMW 67 Billion (US$3.4 Billion) Power Purchase Agreement with Integrated Clean Energy Power Company of China to produce 2,400 Mega Watts of renewable energy. Implementation of the project is expected to be done in a phased manner with the first phase producing 600MW of solar energy distributed as one 300MW power plant in Central Province and another 300MW Power plant in Southern Province. The two 300MW solar power plants of phase one are expected to be connected to the National Grid by the end of 2024.\nPetroleum.\nZambia is a net importer of petroleum and in 2019, Oil &amp; Mineral Fuels ranked top amongst the country's trade imports at a value of U$1.26 billion.\nIn January 2022, the ERB migrated from a Quarterly pricing cycle to a monthly pricing cycle to enable the local price of fuel to be more responsive to the market fundamentals namely: international oil prices and the Kwacha/US Dollar exchange rate prevailing in the month preceding the pricing decision. Further, following the UPND governments' policy decision to place INDENI Petroleum Refinery on care and maintenance, the nation moved to one type of Diesel sold on the market, and that is the imported Low Sulphur Gasoil/Diesel.\nBulk Fuel Depots in Zambia are listed below:\n\"See also\": Tazama Pipeline, Indeni Petroleum Refinery and Lobito\u2013Lusaka Oil Products Pipeline.\nIn January 2023, Zambia announced plans to acquire a stake in its neighbor Angola's Lobito Oil Refinery located in Benguela Province along the Atlantic Coast. The Lobito refinery, that is set to be completed in 2026, will have the capacity to produce 200,000 barrels per day. Under the current proposal, private investors, including Zambia, will own 70% shares in the refinery, while Angola's state oil firm, Sonangol Group, will hold 30% ownership.\nIn September 2023, TAZAMA began constructing a 3\u00a0km pipeline to tie the Tazama Pipeline to the 6.5 million litre Mpika fuel storage depot at a cost of ZMW 31.26 million kwacha (US$1.5 million). When commissioned the pipeline is planned to divert a portion of the low sulfur diesel imported via the pipeline to the storage depot to service the Northern circuit of Zambia with long term benefits of lower fuel costs in the region. This tie-in pipeline is the first of a planned network of distribution pipelines to the other fuel storage depots in Zambia.\nTourism.\nZambia's tourism revenue has been generally raised from local and international tourists visiting the Victoria Falls in Livingstone, and its associated attractions such as the Livingstone Museum and the Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park. In July 2020, the Livingstone Tourism Association reported that during the Heroes and Unity holidays the holiday site received a record number of visitors. Celebrities such as Will Smith and some Entrepreneur have visited the tourist site with the latter celebrating her \u00a33 million nuptials in a picturesque ceremony at The Royal Livingstone Hotel by the banks of the Zambezi River.\nTo advance home grown tourism, in March 2021, African Eagle Hotels, a multi-national company, stated that a 2 Star and 5 Star Hotel each costing U$20 million and U$30 million would be constructed and opened at the Kasaba Bay Resort located in the Nsumbu National Park and open by 2023. In October 2021, through its national budget, the government also allocated ZMW 150 million (U$8.6 million) to further the development of Kasaba Bay, to spur tourism in the Northern Circuit of Zambia.\nManufacturing.\nBelow is a table for the Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) Manufacturing Pulse in Zambia. 50 sets the benchmark, for expansion -&gt;50 and expansion -&lt;50.\nEducation.\nAs of 2022, Zambia runs a free education policy at public early childhood and secondary schools.\nFinance and Banking Services.\nBOZ purchases gold locally from Kansanshi Copper Mine and the Zambia Gold Company for its reserves.\nHealth.\nIn May 2025, the Zambian government signed a Joint Venture (JV) agreement with one of India's largest pharmaceutical companies, Akums Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Limited, to establish a manufacturing plant for the local production of approximately 150 essential medicines.\nInfrastructure.\nThere are many forms of transport in Zambia. Zambia is highly dependent on road transport.\nGrowth.\nThere are, however, positive macroeconomic signs, rooted in reforms implemented in the early and mid-1990s. Zambia's floating exchange rate and open capital markets have provided useful discipline on the government, while at the same time allowing continued diversification of Zambia's export sector, growth in the tourist industry, and procurement of inputs for growing businesses. Some parts of the Copper Belt have experienced a significant revival as spin-off effects from the massive capital reinvestment are experienced.\nExport Diversification.\nAs Zambia continued on its path to diversifying from dependence on Copper with an emphasis on growth in agriculture, in April 2022, the country's Ministry of Agriculture through the Plant Quarantine and Phytosanitary Service (PQPS) approved the first consignment of over 37 metric tons of Zambian grown avocados for export to countries in the European Union.\nThe Multi-Facility Economic Zones (MFEZ).\nIn 2005, the Japanese Government through Japan International Corporation Agency (JICA) aided the Zambia government to introduce the Multi- Facility Economic Zone (MFEZ) programme. The aim is to\u00a0 create a platform for Zambia to achieve economic development by attracting significant domestic and foreign direct investment (FDI) through a strengthened policy and legislative environment. The MFEZs are, special industrial zones for both export-oriented and domestic-oriented industries. The zones are expected to have well appointed infrastructure in place in order to attract and facilitate establishment of world-class enterprises in the zone (s).\nAmong the MFEZ investment incentives offered for companies operating under the MFEZ/Priority Sector include:\nCurrently there are numerous MFEZs in Zambia:\nThe Lusaka South Multi-Facility Economic Zone (LS-MFEZ).\nEstablished in June 2012, the zone prioritizes agribusiness, packaging and printing, palm oil processing, pulp and packaging boards, pharmaceuticals, electrical and electronic appliances, ICTs, education and skills training, R&amp;D, professional, medical, scientific and measuring services.\nIn 2020, the LS-MFEZ realised US$100.6 million worth of investments bringing the accumulated investments to about US$567.6 million and generating about 7,100 jobs since commencing operations in 2012.\nIn 2021, the LS-MFEZ realised a record US$309.4 million worth of investments bringing the accumulated investments to about US$877.4 million with permanent jobs at about 9,360 and total jobs including construction workers at 11,560.\nThe Lusaka East Multi-Facility Economic Zone.\nThis zone is also known as the Zambia-China Economic &amp; Trade Cooperation Zone (ZCCZ).\nThe zone prioritizes agriculture (circular and tourism agricultures), agro-processing, brewery, pharmaceuticals, building materials, logistics (storage) and international commerce.\nRoma Industrial and Commercial Park.\nLaunched in 2011, is expected to generate more than 4,000 permanent jobs once fully developed and is focused on real estate and residential developments.\nChambishi Multi-Facility Economic Zone (CMFEZ).\nOpened in 2007, prioritizes mining, engineering equipment assembly, construction materials, fertilizers, agriculture, and service sectors such as banking and hospitals.\nBy 2016, the CMFEZ had already received investment of about US$800 million from 14 enterprises.\nChembe Multi-Facility Economic Zone.\nIn 2016, the government launched the development of the Chembe Multi-Facility Economic Zone in Chembe, Luapula Province.\nChibombo Multi-Facility Economic Zone.\nLocated in Chibombo District, Central Province, Zambia, the ground breaking for this zone was held in November 2018 and is also known as the Jiangxi Multi-Facility Economic Zone.\nIn October 2021, the Chibombo MFEZ signed six project agreements worth US$160 million projected to create over 1,000 jobs.\nLumwana Multi-Facility Economic Zone.\nIn November 2009, the government of Zambia announced a plan for a US$1.2 billion investment into the declared Lumwana Multi-Facility Economic Zone.\nSub-Saharan Gemstones Exchange Industrial Park.\nThis Multi-Facility Economic Zone (MFEZ) is located in Ndola, Copperbelt Province.\nBy October 2011, over US$10 million had been invested in the infrastructure in the MFEZ.\nKalumbila Multi-Facility Economic Zone (MFEZ).\nLocated in North-Western Province, this MFEZ received approval by the Ministry of Commerce, Trade and Industry in September 2022.\nThe expected initial investment was approximately US$ 100 million.\nThe facility was intended to offer local vendors an industrial base to set up a local supply chain for the growing Kalumbila copper mine, upcoming Enterprise nickel mine, and other businesses around the First Quantum Minerals (FQM) sites.\nGolden Boaobab Multi-Facility Economic Zone.\nIn July 2024, the Government of Zambia approved the creation of the an MFEZ in Kafue District in Lusaka Province. The facility is expected to receive an initial investment of up to 6.7 billion kwacha (US$ 300 million) and create 2,000 jobs over a 5 year period. Planned developments include assembly of 40-tonne tipper trucks for mining, earth-moving machinery and commercial vehicles, steel processing, food processing facilities, two- and three-wheeler motorcycle assembly, a solar energy plant and electric vehicle assembly.\nMSME Financing.\nIn July 2025, Growth Investment Partners (GIP) Zambia, a partnership between British International Investment (BII), Swedfund and Zambia's National Pension Scheme Authority (Napsa) was launched.The partnership was meant to provide 1.6 billion kwacha (US$ 70 million) in funding for small and medium-sized businesses in local currency. The commitments were 859 billion kwacha (US$ 37,5 million) from BII, 401 million kwacha (US$ 17.5 million) from Napsa and 344 million kwacha (US$ 15 million) from Swedfund. Over the next 15 years, GIP Zambia is expected to deploy more than 6.9 billion kwacha ($300 million) to 150 SMEs.\nFintech.\nZambia has a relatively quiet startup and venture capital space; however, the trend seems to be shifting as in August 2021 fintech company Union54 led the way by being the first Zambian startup accepted into Y Combinator's summer batch of YC 2021. In October 2021, American investment firm Tiger Global led a U$3 million seed round in Union54. And in April 2022, the Zambian company raised an additional U$12 million in a seed extension round also led by Tiger Global.\nSalaula.\nStandard economic theory and empirical data indicates that second-hand clothing import can have positive effects in a country like Zambia (one of the least developed countries in the world). The \"salaula\" market reduces the proportion of income that a family has to spend on clothing. It also helps to keep employments like repairs and alterations in business and forces tailors to proceed into more specialize production of styled garments.\nThere is a downside to such imports, however; the massive importation of used clothing from the developed world has resulted in a near-total collapse of the Zambian indigenous textile industry. In the face of cheap used clothing, tailors' specialized production may be irrelevant - customers will buy the least expensive clothing available, irrespective of style. Those who might otherwise work at textile mills or clothing factories are left jobless, or else make significantly less money in the salaula resale business.\nElectric Battery Value Chain.\nZambia and Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), two countries, that have more than 70% of the world's Cobalt reserves and an abundance of Copper, Nickel and Manganese have resolved to set up a Zambia-DRC-Executive Battery Council to oversee the implementation of the cooperating agreement for the electric vehicle battery value chain. The Executive Council's executive committee will be composed of President Hakainde Hichilema, his DRC counterpart Felix Tshisekedi, the Deputy Secretary General of the African Economic Community for the United Nations, as well as the President of AFREXIM Bank, as a financial partner. Also issued was a communiqu\u00e9 by the two heads of state that indicated that the two countries will also harmonize policies for the initiative. Zambia and the DRC signed the MOU in Lusaka Zambia on 29 April 2022.\nIn July 2022, the African Export-Import Bank President Benedict Oramah, whilst in Lusaka Zambia, announced that a pool of investors had earmarked more than US$500.0 million to set up an industrial park for the purposes of adding value to the copper, cobalt, and manganese mined in Zambia. The investors will set up plants to process cobalt, copper, and lithium that are in Zambia and neighboring countries and establish a US$250 million Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) manufacturing plant.\nIn July 2022, at the 94th https:// in Lusaka, the managing director of the National Utility ZESCO, Victor Mapani announced that the company plans to deploy Electric Vehicle EV charging stations across the country in an effort to accelerate and promote the transition to EVs and enhance carbon emission reduction.\nIn December 2022, on the sidelines of the ongoing US-Africa summit in Washington DC, Zambia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the United States of America signed an MOU toward the actualization of the electric vehicle battery value chain. Different US institutions and agencies such as USAID, the US Department of Commerce, the Trade and Development Agency, are exploring technical assistance for the Zambia-DRC EV supply chain.\u00a0Additionally, the Export-Import Bank of the United States, the Development Finance Corporation, will be exploring financing and support mechanisms for investment in African electric vehicle value chains.\nIn April 2023, The African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) and the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) signed a framework agreement with Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo for the establishment of special economic zones for the production of electric vehicles and batteries. Afreximbank and ECA will lead the establishment of an operating company in consortium with public and private investors and Afreximbank's impact fund subsidiary, the Fund for Export Development in Africa. The new company will develop special economic zones (SEZs) dedicated to the production of battery precursors, batteries, and electric vehicles, in both nations.\nIn October 2023, the Chinese company Better Technology Group announced that procurement of electric vehicle battery, energy storage battery and Uninterruptiple Supply battery manufacturing equipment was under underway and will be delivered in Zambia by December 2023. This equipment will be part of the EV battery manufacturing facility to be set up in Zambia's Chibomba- Jiangxi Multi Facility Economic Zone in Central Province with construction set to be completed by March 2024. The Group President also announced that the company has budgeted to invest ZMW 2.18 billion kwacha (US$100 million) in the Venture through 2026.\nTelecommunications.\nIn June 2023, an internet services license was granted to Starlink by the Zambian Government through the Electronic Government Division \u2013 SMART Zambia, following the completion of trial projects throughout the nation.\nInflation.\nLack of balance-of-payment support meant the Zambian government did not have resources for capital investment and periodically had to issue bonds or otherwise expand the money supply to try to meet its spending and debt obligations. The government continued these activities even after balance-of-payment support resumed. This has kept interest rates at levels that are too high for local business, fuelled inflation, burdened the budget with domestic debt payments, while still falling short of meeting the public payroll and other needs, such as infrastructure rehabilitation. The government was forced to draw down foreign exchange reserves sharply in 1998 to meet foreign debt obligations, putting further pressure on the kwacha and inflation. Inflation held at 32% in 2000; consequently, the kwacha lost the same value against the dollar over the same period. In mid- to late 2001, Zambia's fiscal management became more conservative. As a result, 2001 year-end inflation was below 20%, its best result in decades. In 2002 inflation rose to 26.7%. However, in 2007 inflation hit 8%, the first time in 30 years that Zambia had seen single digit inflation.\nOn January 27, 2011, it was reported by the Central Statistical Office that inflation rose to 9%. in 2012\nBetween April 2019 and April 2020 Zambia' s Annual inflation rate rose to 15.7% from 14% in March 2020. The rise of prices in food and other non- food items led to the increase in the Annual inflation rate.\nHowever, it is significant that inflation often peaks in election years, hitting a recent high of 17.9% in 2016. This suggests that a further peak is likely approaching during the 2021 general elections. The value of the kwacha against the dollar has been relatively consistent for the past two years and has yet to return to the recent high of almost 0.2 kwacha to the dollar in 2013. Nonetheless, the real effective exchange rate of the kwacha against a weighted average of foreign currencies improved from 88.5 in 2016 to 96.4 in 2017. The kwacha lost value against the dollar in September 2018 but has remained fairly consistent at 0.08 to the dollar in November to December, though further instability remains likely due to both political and economic uncertainty.\nTrade.\nMajor trade enhancing infrastructure projects carried out in Zambia's history:\nPublic Private Partnerships (PPP).\nIn December 2021, Zambia's UPND Government set up the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Council of Ministers composed of the Minister of Finance and National Planning (Dr. Situmbeko Musokotwane) as the Chairperson and the Ministers of Infrastructure (Charles Milupi), Commerce, Trade, and Industry (Chipoka Mulenga), Transport and Logistics (Frank Tayali), and Technology and Science (Felix Mutati). The focus of the council is to have public-private partnerships become the primary avenue for infrastructure development as opposed to the solely government funded path.\nConstituency Development Funds Performance.\nDecentralized funds directed at enhancing public service delivery and targeted at local communities to spur economic development at ward and constituency level.\nPrivate Wealth.\nIn 2021, the total estimated value of private wealth in Zambia was US$14 billion (ZMW 238 billion)\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "34436", "revid": "5666248", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34436", "title": "Zambian Defence Force", "text": "Military of Zambia\nThe Zambian Defence Force is the military of Zambia. It consists of the Zambian Army, the Zambian Air Force, and the Zambia National Service. The defence forces were formed at Zambian independence on 24 October 1964, from constituent units of the dissolved Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland Armed Forces. During the 1970s and 1980s, it played a key role in a number of regional conflicts, namely the South African Border War and Rhodesian Bush War. Being a landlocked country Zambia has no navy, although the Zambian Army maintains a maritime patrol unit for maintaining security on inland bodies of water.\nHistory.\nBackground and independence.\nThe Zambian Defence Force had its roots in the Northern Rhodesia Regiment, a multi-ethnic military unit which was raised by the British colonial government and had served with distinction during World War II. In 1960, the constituent colonies of Northern Rhodesia, Southern Rhodesia, and Nyasaland were amalgamated into a self-governing British dependency known as the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. When the federation was dissolved three years later, the assets and personnel of its armed forces were integrated with those of its successor states, including Northern Rhodesia, which subsequently gained independence as Zambia. For example, Zambia received half the federal armoured car squadron as well as some light patrol aircraft. Zambia also inherited the command structures of the Northern Rhodesia Regiment as well as the Northern Rhodesian Air Wing, which formed the basis for the new Zambian Army and Zambian Air Force, respectively.\nRelations almost immediately soured between Zambia and Southern Rhodesia, now known simply as \"Rhodesia\", which had issued its own unilateral declaration of independence (UDI) in 1965. Reports that Rhodesian security forces had occupied Kariba Dam prompted Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda to mobilise the ZDF for the first time and deploy troops to the border. The ZDF was withdrawn when Kaunda received a guarantee that Zambia's supply of Kariba power would not be interrupted. Nevertheless, military tension between the two nations remained high, and border incidents resulting in civilian deaths occurred. In November 1966, Rhodesian troops fired across the border and killed a Zambian woman on the north bank of the Zambezi River. In January 1973, Zambian troops fired on a South African police patrol boat on the Zambezi. Shortly afterwards, Defence Minister Grey Zulu ordered that the ZDF return to the border in force. Later in the month Kaunda brought the first of several complaints before the United Nations Security Council charging that Rhodesian security forces were violating Zambia's sovereignty and territorial integrity with South African support. Tensions flared again when Zambian troops fired across the border and killed two Canadian tourists on the Rhodesian side of Victoria Falls in May 1973.\nThe increasing prospect of war with Rhodesia posed several unique security dilemmas for the ZDF. Firstly, Zambia lacked the manpower or conventional hardware necessary to provide a suitable deterrent to a Rhodesian incursion. It also remained dependent on a relatively small pool of white senior officers and technical personnel. After 1967 Kaunda's government began replacing them with foreign officers on contract, ostensibly to minimise the potential for conflicts of loyalty. Between 1967 and 1970 the majority of officers in the ZDF were seconded from the British Army. In 1971, the ZDF was finally prepared to appoint its first black army and air force commanders. Due to the white community's close ties with Rhodesia and South Africa, white Zambians were subsequently barred from voluntary enlistment and granted a blanket exemption from conscription.\nAround September 1967, Kaunda made two requests to the United States for equipment for the Zambian Army, including long-range missile systems, but was rebuffed. More successful were Zambia's attempts to acquire its first combat aircraft, a number of Aermacchi MB-326 and SIAI-Marchetti SF.260s sourced from Italy; the first black Zambian Air Force pilots were trained by Italian instructors between 1966 and 1969. Italy also sold the ZDF helicopters and towed artillery.\nInvolvement in regional conflicts, 1968\u201380.\nDuring the 1970s, Zambia began providing sanctuary for a number of revolutionary and militant political movements dedicated to overthrowing colonial and white minority rule elsewhere on the African continent. Guerrilla armies based in exile in Zambia included the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN) and the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA). These movements ultimately embroiled the ZDF in their own internal power struggles as well as direct clashes with foreign troops carrying out preemptive strikes. In 1968, the ZDF skirmished with Portuguese troops which had pursued a number of Angolan or Mozambican insurgents into Zambia. In September 1975, Zambian troops became locked in a firefight with insurgents of the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA). The ZDF killed eleven ZANLA insurgents and later expelled that movement from Zambian soil. A year later, nearly two thousand disaffected PLAN insurgents in Zambia launched a mutiny which became known as the \"Shipanga Affair\". The army was forced to marshal several battalions to subdue the dissidents.\nIn response to Zambia's increasingly open support for PLAN, South Africa sponsored a force of Kaonde-speaking dissidents under Adamson Mushala, known as the Zambian Democratic Supreme Council (DSC). The DSC maintained a low level insurgency in Zambia's North-Western and Western Provinces. Mushala's guerrillas sabotaged infrastructure, skirmished with the ZDF, and collected intelligence on PLAN movements inside Zambia. They were trained by South African Special Forces and instructors recruited from the Portuguese Directorate-General of Security. In 1973, an army unit killed a hundred of the guerrillas by ambushing them as they attempted to cross the Zambezi near the Caprivi Strip. Mushala was largely inactive until early 1976, when his guerrillas skirmished twice with the ZDF and hijacked an army payroll.\nAs a result of the new challenges posed by the Mushala insurgency and the presence of foreign militants, the ZDF underwent an extensive reorganisation and adopted a new unified command structure. It was renamed the \"Zambian National Defence Force\" (ZNDF) in 1976. A prevailing feature of the new ZNDF was its adoption of a third branch known as the Zambian National Service. The objective of the Zambian National Service was to provide basic military instruction to all Zambian citizens in the event they needed to be mobilised as reservists during wartime. The ZNDF became increasingly politicised, with the ruling United National Independence Party (UNIP) forming party branches in the barracks and introducing a number of political education programs for military personnel. Under the UNIP, the ZNDF was not subject to public audit or parliamentary oversight. This was justified under the pretext that the ZNDF's development was tied to the exigencies of wartime.\nBetween 1977 and 1980 military tension with South Africa and Rhodesia continued to escalate, resulting in a renewed spate of border incidents. In 1977, the ZNDF bombarded Rhodesian positions near Victoria Falls with rocket and mortar fire. The reasons for the attack were disputed but the Zambian government maintained that the troops involved had been deliberately provoked by Rhodesian forces into firing. Around March 1978, the ZNDF claimed to have been involved in repelling a Rhodesian raid on a ZIPRA training camp. It also assisted PLAN insurgents during a raid on a South African military base in the Caprivi Strip. South Africa retaliated by shelling several ZNDF positions near the border, and Rhodesia began targeting ZNDF outposts. Growing Zambian war weariness was a significant factor in Kaunda's influencing the guerrilla movements in Rhodesia to seek peace, resulting in a negotiated end to that conflict. Kaunda also bowed to South African pressure and ordered PLAN to close its rear base facilities in Zambia by 1979. At the same time, the ZNDF embarked on a 70 million kwacha modernisation program with assistance from the Soviet Union. The Soviets provided the Zambian Army with tanks, wheeled armored vehicles, and technical instruction on especially generous terms; the Zambian Air Force received its first fighter aircraft in the form of a Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 squadron at the same time.\nEnd of the Cold War and reforms.\nIn October 1980, two ZNDF officers, Brigadier Godfrey Miyanda and Colonel Patrick Mkandawire were arrested for planning a coup d'\u00e9tat with the support of an exiled Congolese insurgent movement, the Front for Congolese National Liberation (FLNC). The plot involved arming the FLNC with ZNDF weaponry and later providing that movement with rear operating bases in Zambia as a reward for their efforts if the coup succeeded. The ZNDF and the police apprehended the conspirators before they had opportunity to set the coup in motion and later raided the FLNC's base camp, detaining most of the insurgents.\nDue in part to the extreme secrecy surrounding the ZNDF's budget and the refusal of the UNIP to allow parliamentary debate on the topic, a number of problems concerning military funding were covered up rather than addressed. For example, the facilities at ZNS training camps were so inadequate that typhoid outbreaks became common among recruits. This was due to lack of funds to filter the camps' drinking water. After a particularly serious typhoid outbreak between 1980 and 1981, the government was forced to suspend and later stop the compulsory national service programme.\nIn November 1982, the ZNDF killed Adamson Mushala in an ambush outside Solwezi, although his followers continued to carry out operations under the leadership of Alexander Saimbwende. The DSC continued to pose a sufficient threat that an Italian mineral survey team had to be evacuated from Northwestern Province in 1984 after being targeted by the guerrillas. Nevertheless, the erosion of South African support ensured that its forces remained small and poorly armed. Mushala and later Saimbwende turned to ivory poaching to sustain their war effort against the ZNDF.\nAs the Mozambican Civil War intensified, the ZNDF had to contend with a number of armed incursions by Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO) insurgents, who raided Zambian border towns in search of food and other supplies. The ZNDF made it a policy to pursue RENAMO into neighbouring Mozambique in hot pursuit if necessary.\nIn 1988, a second coup d'\u00e9tat attempt was planned, this time by Lieutenant General Christian Tembo and at least three other senior army officers. The conspirators were detained before they could carry it out, but this temporarily jeopardised relations between the Zambian government and the army.\nThe end of the Cold War brought a number of changes to the Zambian political situation and the ZNDF. The ZNDF remained heavily in debt with the former Soviet bloc for military equipment it had purchased in the 1980s, as well as interest accrued. The army in particular was badly affected by the collapse of its Soviet technical training program, which left much of its heavy weapons unserviceable.\nFollowing mass protests over President Kaunda's decision to cut subsidies for maize meal and double maize prices in 1990, Captain Mwamba Luchembe single-handedly seized the national radio station and announced a coup d'\u00e9tat. Luchembe held the radio station for only two hours before being arrested. Kaunda's unpopularity led to demonstrations in support of Luchembe, however, and the same day the president announced he would seek a referendum on democratic multi-party elections. Kaunda granted a blanket amnesty to his political opponents as he prepared to accept the return of multi-party elections, which would shortly thereafter end his term of almost three decades. Among those who received amnesty was Alexander Saimbwende, who surrendered to the government and ended the DSC insurgency.\nThe 1991 general election brought Frederick Chiluba and his opposition Movement for Multi-Party Democracy to power and ushered in a period of reforms for the ZNDF. The Chiluba government dismantled the ZNDF's unified command structure and allowed the army, ZNS, and air force to revert to independent commands. The system of political patronage introduced to the ZNDF by Kaunda was also abandoned. A general demobilisation programme was instituted in the army, and parliament gained the ability to debate defence expenditure. The Chiluba government immediately formed a Public Accounts Committee to reduce financial irregularities in the ZNDF, most of which were linked to corruption and abuse of the ministerial tender system. Zambia's 1991 constitution formally reinstated the title \"Zambian Defence Force\" for the armed forces.\nIn October 1997, Captain Steven Lungu seized control of the national radio station and announced a coup d'\u00e9tat. Lungu dismissed the chiefs of the army and police and announced that he was forming a new Government of National Redemption. He gave President Chiluba an ultimatum of three hours to surrender or face death. Loyal ZDF troops responded by storming the radio station, capturing Lungu and five other coup plotters.\nIn early August 2022, the government announced that it would recruit up to 5,000 military personnel by October of the same year.\nCommand.\nIn 1976 Zambia adopted a unified command system, in which the three Service Chiefs reported to a Commander of the Zambian National Defence Force (ZNDF). The Commander of Zambia Air Force at the time, Air Commodore Peter Zuze, was promoted to Lieutenant-General and appointed as Deputy Commander of the ZNDF. However, the Zambia Air Force and Zambia National Service resented this system because Army officers filled most senior appointments in the ZNDF and the system was ended in 1980. The country then reverted to the command system inherited at independence where Service Chiefs report to the Head of State through a Minister of Defence.\nThe current (2021) Command is:\n- President and Commander-in-Chief: Hakainde Hichilema (from 24 August 2021)\n- Defence Minister: Ambrose Lwiji Lufuma (from 27 August 2021)\n- Permanent Secretary for Defence: Norman Chipakupaku\n- Commander Zambia Army: Lieut.-General Dennis Sitali Alibuzwi (from 29 August 2021)\n- Deputy Commander Zambia Army: Major-General Geoffrey Zyeele (from 29 August 2021)\n- Commander Zambia Air Force: Lieut.-General Collins Barry (from 29 August 2021)\n- Deputy Commander Zambia Air Force: Major General Oscar Nyoni\n- Commandant Zambia National Service: Lieut.-General Patrick Kayombo Solochi\n- Deputy Commandant Zambia National Service: Major-General Reuben Mwewa\n- Commandant Defence Services and Staff Training College: Brigadier General Benson Musonda.\nZambia Army.\nOrganisation.\nThe current Army organisation is:\nThree infantry brigades -\nWith the following units:\nZambia Air Force.\nThe Zambia Air Force is a small air force that developed from the Northern Rhodesian Air Wing as well as the former Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland Air Force. In recent years the aircraft inventory has largely been updated with Chinese aircraft reflecting the increasing closeness between the Zambian Defence Force and China. During 1999 eight Karakorum-8 jet trainers were delivered and in 2006 the Zambia Air Force received two Xian MA60 and five Yakovlev Yak-12 transport aircraft from China. During March 2012 a further eight K-8 were received. Four Harbin Z-9 helicopters were delivered in June 2012, with a further four delivered by March 2013 (when one of the new aircraft was lost in an accident, see below).\nIn April 2014 six Hongdu L-15 Falcon supersonic lead-in fighter/trainer jets were ordered from China, the first arriving in December 2015. Around the same time orders were placed for six SIAI-Marchetti SF.260TW trainer aircraft, one Alenia C-27J Spartan transport aircraft, and a number of Russian-made Mil Mi-17 helicopters. These orders were expected to be delivered during 2016.\nZambia National Service.\nThe Zambia National Service is a defence wing that is mandated to train citizens to serve the republic, develop infrastructure and enhance national food security and contribute to the social economic development. Zambia National Service (ZNS) personnel have been included in peacekeeping contingents deployed by Zambia to the United Nation's MINUSCA mission in the Central African Republic.\nSix months of training for 400 youths was planned for 2016. This was to include 200 males to be trained at Chiwoko ZNS Training Centre, Katete, Eastern Province, and 200 females to be trained at the Kitwe ZNS training camp.\nUnited Nations Peacekeeping Missions.\nZambia has been an active participant in several UN peacekeeping operations, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. Zambian personnel have been fated to be caught up in some of the more dramatic incidents of recent UN Peacekeeping in Africa: witnessing the Kibeho Massacre in Rwanda during April 1995; having large numbers of Zambian peacekeepers taken hostage by rebels in Sierra Leone during 2000; and with troops caught up in fighting between Sudanese and South Sudanese forces in the contested Abyei area during May 2011. Despite these crises Zambian forces have generally performed well and earned a reputation as effective peacekeepers.\nUN missions which have seen the deployment of battalions of Zambian troops, or other significant contingents, include the following.\nUNAVEM III (United Nations Angola Verification Mission III, February 1995 to June 1997)\nA Zambian battalion was deployed to southern Angola, based in the town of Menongue. Seven Zambian peacekeepers died during the UNAVEM III deployment.\nUNAMIR (United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda)\nThree Zambian fatalities.\nUNAMSIL (United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone)\nThirty-four Zambian fatalities.\nUNMIS (United Nations Mission in the Sudan)\nThree Zambian fatalities. Four Zambian peacekeepers were wounded on 10 May 2011, shortly before the independence of South Sudan and before an outbreak of fighting when the Zambians were criticised for not better protecting civilians.\nMINUSCA (United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic)\nDuring 2017 Warrant Officer 2 Boyd Chibuye died whilst deployed in the Central African Republic.\nOn 4 December 2017 a Zambian police member of the UN mission was reported injured in an attack by anti-Balaka fighters in Bria, northern CAR. One Mauritanian policeman was killed and two others injured in this attack.\nStaff Sergeant Derrick Sichilyango of the Zambian Contingent was killed in a road traffic accident in November 2018.\nStaff Sergeant Patrick Simasiku Wamunyima and Staff Sergeant Alex Mudenda Musanda, both serving with MINUSCA, died during 2019 and were honoured on the 2020 International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers with the posthumous award of the Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld Medal.\nSADC Missions.\nSAPMIL (SADC Preventive Mission in the Kingdom of Lesotho)\nDuring November 2017 a small Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) standby force was deployed to Lesotho to assist that country through an internal security crisis following the assassination of the Lesotho Defence Force Commander, Lieut.-General Khoantle Mot\u0161omot\u0161o, on 5 September 2017. This SADC force included a 207-strong military element which had a Zambian Deputy Commander and which included 36 infantry and nine logistics personnel from Zambia. The mission wrapped up in November 2018 after successfully stabilising the Kingdom.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

During the Cold War Zambia was a member of the Non-Aligned Movement.\nZambia is a member of 44 international organizations, with the United Nations, World Trade Organization, African Union, Commonwealth of Nations and Southern African Development Community being among the most notable.\nZambia is involved in a border dispute concerning the convergence of the boundaries of Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe. An additional dispute with the Democratic Republic of Congo concerns the Lunchinda-Pweto Enclave.\nHistory.\nAfter independence in 1964, Zambia was one of the most vocal opponents to white minority rule and colonialism. President Kenneth Kaunda, who held office 1964\u20131991, was a very visible advocate of change in Southern Africa. He actively supported UNITA during the Angolan liberation and civil war, SWAPO during their fight for Namibian independence from apartheid South Africa, Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), and the African National Congress in their fight against apartheid in South Africa.\nMany of these organizations were based in Zambia during the 1970s and 1980s. For this reason South Africa as well as Rhodesia carried out military raids on targets inside Zambia. Zambia's support for the various liberation movements also caused problems for the Zambian economy, since it was heavily dependent on electricity supply and transportation through South Africa and Rhodesia. However these problems was partly solved by the Kariba Dam and the construction of the Chinese supported Tan-Zam railway.\nFor their part in the liberations struggles, Zambia enjoys wide popularity among the countries they supported as well as all over Africa. For instance, former South African president Nelson Mandela often referred to the debt South Africa owes Zambia.\nBefore Zambian independence, Kaunda met with John F Kennedy while visiting the United States in 1961, and he would meet with Lyndon Johnson, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and George H.W. Bush at the White House during his long presidency. He also clashed with British prime minister Margaret Thatcher on several occasions, disliking her policy towards South Africa.\nAs with most African states, Zambia was a member of the Non-Aligned Movement during the Cold War, and is still today. The country hosted the 3rd Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in 1970. In practice Zambia was more to the left than to the right during the Cold War. The country had good relations with China and with Yugoslavia. Kaunda is famous in Yugoslavia for crying openly at president Josip Broz Tito's funeral.\nKaunda's successor, president Frederick Chiluba (1991\u20132002), also played an important role in African politics. His government played a constructive regional role sponsoring Angola peace talks that led to the 1994 Lusaka Protocols. Zambia has provided troops to UN peacekeeping initiatives in Mozambique, Rwanda, Angola, and Sierra Leone. Zambia was the first African state to cooperate with the International Tribunal investigation of the 1994 Rwanda genocide.\nIn 1998, Zambia took the lead in efforts to establish a cease-fire in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Zambia was active in the Congolese peace effort after the signing of a cease-fire agreement in Lusaka in July and August 1999, although activity diminished considerably after the Joint Military Commission tasked with implementing the ceasefire relocated to Kinshasa in September 2001.\nInternational organizations.\nZambia is a member of 45 international organisations. These are:\nConcerning Zambia's membership in the ICC, Zambia has a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the United States military from prosecution.\nUnited Nations.\nZambia joined the United Nations on 1 December 1964, only a month after the nation had become independent. Zambia has a permanent mission to the UN, with headquarters on 237 East 52nd Street, New York City. The head of the mission is Tens Chisola Kapoma.\nRegional diplomacy.\nFollowing the independence of Zambia on 24 October 1964, the country has lent military aid and support to numerous movements and governments on the international stage. Most notably, Zambia has a history of providing military aid to combatants and political parties fighting for independence throughout Africa. The aid that Zambia has provided for African nationalistic movements during the colonial era revolves around both military and diplomatic arrangement for liberation and peace. The Zambian Defense Force (ZDF), which consists of the Zambian Army, Zambian Air force and Zambian National Service, has played a key part in a multitude of key regional and international conflicts throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Most notably, the Zambian military has provided counter insurgent efforts during major African confrontations such as the Rhodesian Bush War despite not being the main belligerent.\nZambia has a history of supporting regional liberation movements and Former President Kenneth Kaunda had previously decreed that \"Zambia will not be independent and free until the rest of Africa is Free\". As a large central nation, the governability of Zambia relies on the stability and diplomacy of nearby states that surround Zambia. Nevertheless, in the late 1970s, Kaunda's regime actively confronted the so-called \"White South\" regimes which controlled South Africa, Rhodesia and Namibia, forming part of the Frontline States alliance. Regional stability allowed Former President Kenneth Kaunda to maintain power in the relatively poor nation for several decades.\nLiberation and political support.\nZambia received its own liberation from colonialism relatively early from Britain. The newly formed Zambian government under President Kenneth Kaunda of the UNIP party was active in the liberation and disputes of its neighbors for decades following its independence. The Zambian government offered shelter for revolutionaries, mediated treaty signings and offered aid and weapons. The continuation of colonial rule in Southern Africa was seen as a slight to Zambia and inherent feelings of African unity drove the new nation to aid its neighbors resist colonial rule.\nMost notably, Zambia was a haven for revolutionaries from the Namibia liberation party, South West African People's Organization (SWAPO) and the African National Congress (ANC) in South Africa. Zambia provided a rear base for revolutionaries as well as administrative and political aid.\nSWAPO.\nThe South West African People's Organization (SWAPO) is a political party that was formerly an independence movement based in Namibia. Due to pressures from within Namibia, SWAPO moved its headquarters and much of its forces into neighboring Zambia in the 1970s. Zambia became a safe haven for the group and SWAPO set up guerrilla training camps and sent exiled members into Zambia. The Shipanga Crisis, so named for senior SWAPO leader Andreas Shipanga, saw the Zambian government help round up thousands of dissidents and critics of the movement. SWAPO leaders in Namibia saw growing dissent in the SWAPO installations and guerrilla camps in Zambia, and appealed to then President Kaunda for help. After rounding up thousands of perceived rebels, including Shipanga with the aid of Zambia, SWAPO leadership in Namibia became markedly more authoritarian.\nAfrican National Congress.\nThe African National Congress was an anti-apartheid political party based in South Africa, with close ideological ties to the Zambian African National Congress of President Kenneth Kaunda. When the political party was banned in South Africa by the colonial government, many of its leaders went underground or fled to Zambia. Lusaka, the capital of Zambia, became the new headquarters for many ANC leaders in exile from their native South Africa. Zambia thus developed a legacy of being the center of activity for South African liberation and allowed exiled leaders to convene and organize. Former South African President Nelson Mandela had expressed the important role that Zambia played in the liberation of their country during the years of exile. Zambia's policy of liberation through diplomacy and discreet support for African nationalist movements within the region is most poignant in the South African case.\nZimbabwe.\nZambia has also provided key support to the liberation struggles of nearby Zimbabwe from their colonial rulers in the 1960s to 1970s. Specifically, Zambia provided armed and diplomatic support to Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) and the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) during their struggles against the unrecognized rogue state Rhodesian government in the Rhodesian Bush War. Zambia provided limited arms and training towards Zimbabwe's African nationalist movements, but largely applied diplomatic approaches to induce liberation in Zimbabwe. This included multiple visits and discussion between the Rhodesian government and Zambia leaders to negotiate a resolution to the civil strife within the country. Eventually, in 1979, the Rhodesian government submitted to international pressures and conducted elections that lead to majority rule and the eventual renaming of the country as Zimbabwe.\nUNITA.\nThe National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) was a party in Angola that served as one of the main belligerents in the Angolan Civil War of 1975 against People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA). Zambia, under Kenneth Kaunda trained and funded UNITA against the MPLA during the civil war. Lusaka remained one of the most ardent supporters of the UNITA African nationalists and UNITA troops trained in Zambia. Since then, Zambia has rescinded its historical support of UNITA and has apologized to the current Angolan government over the historical support of UNITA.\nRoles in regional disputes.\nAngolan Civil War.\nZambia was key in facilitating talks between People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) of the Angolan Civil War. The Angolan Civil War waged on from 1975 onward and involved massive foreign intervention in the face of the Cold War. Initiated by Zambia, the Lusaka Protocol was a treaty that attempted to end the Civil War by disarmament and national reconciliation. The treaty was signed in Lusaka on 20 November 1994 and garnered international support, as well as support from Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and South African President Nelson Mandela. Ultimately the fighting resumed, and by 1998, the peace process ceased.\nThe Second Congo War.\nThe Second Congo war was a major African continental war that began in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1998, and involved nine different African countries. Zambia was not a belligerent in this military engagement, but sought to facilitate peace and an end to the fighting. Representatives from various international organizations such as the United Nations, met on 21\u201327 June 1999 in Lusaka in order to draft a resolution to the conflict. The ceasefire agreement set to end the fighting, deploy peacekeeping forces and release prisoners of war on both sides of the fighting. Heads of state from Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Namibia, Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe convened in Lusaka, Zambia on 10 July 1999 to sign the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement. Ultimately hostilities continued despite the passage of the Peace Agreement, and the official fighting did not resolve itself until 2003.\nAfrican cooperation.\nZambia is a member of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), now known as the African Union, and was its chairman until July 2002. Zambia also takes part in the unions economical cooperation, the African Economic Community (AEC). Among the AEC's different pillars, Zambia takes part in two; Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the preferential trade area Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA). The country is also a member of the Port Management Association of Eastern and Southern Africa (PMAESA).\nSADC was founded in Zambia's capital Lusaka on 1 April 1980, and COMESA has its headquarters there as well.\nInternational disputes.\nA dormant dispute remains where Botswana, Namibia, Zambia, and Zimbabwe's boundaries converge; and with the DRC in the Lunchinda-Pweto Enclave in the North of Chienge following concerns on the Zambia-Congo Delimitation Treaty raised with the late President Laurent Kabila. The lack of demarcation beacons, and the citizenship rights of people in that enclave remain thorny issues, especially in Luapula Province.\nZambia and the Commonwealth of Nations.\nZambia has been a republic in the Commonwealth of Nations since 24 October 1964, when Northern Rhodesia became independent.\nDiplomatic relations.\nList of countries which Zambia maintains diplomatic relations with:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "34439", "revid": "196446", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34439", "title": "Zoonosis", "text": "Diseases of humans caused by a pathogen\nA zoonosis (; plural zoonoses) or zoonotic disease is an infectious disease of humans caused by a pathogen (an infectious agent, such as a virus, bacterium, parasite, fungi, or prion) that can jump from a non-human vertebrate to a human. When humans infect non-humans, it is called reverse zoonosis or anthroponosis.\nMajor modern diseases such as Ebola and salmonellosis are zoonoses. HIV was a zoonotic disease transmitted to humans in the early part of the 20th century, though it has now evolved into a separate human-only disease. Human infection with animal influenza viruses is rare, as they do not transmit easily to or among humans. However, avian and swine influenza viruses in particular possess high zoonotic potential, and these occasionally recombine with human strains of the flu and can cause pandemics such as the 2009 swine flu. Zoonoses can be caused by a range of disease pathogens such as emergent viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites; of 1,415 pathogens known to infect humans, 61% were zoonotic. Most human diseases originated in non-humans; however, only diseases that routinely involve non-human to human transmission, such as rabies, are considered direct zoonoses.\nZoonoses have different modes of transmission. In direct zoonosis the disease is directly transmitted between non-humans and humans through the air (influenza), bites and saliva (rabies), faecal-oral transmission or through contaminated food. Transmission can also occur via an intermediate species (referred to as a vector), which carry the disease pathogen without getting sick. The term is from grc \" \"\u03b6\u1ff7\u03bf\u03bd\" (zoon)\"\u00a0'animal' and \" \"\u03bd\u03cc\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2\" (nosos)\"\u00a0'sickness'.\nHost genetics plays an important role in determining which non-human viruses will be able to make copies of themselves in the human body. Dangerous non-human viruses are those that require few mutations to begin replicating themselves in human cells. These viruses are dangerous since the required combinations of mutations might randomly arise in the natural reservoir.\nCauses.\nThe emergence of zoonotic diseases originated with the domestication of animals. Zoonotic transmission can occur in any context in which there is contact with or consumption of animals, animal products, or animal derivatives. This can occur in a companionistic (pets), economic (farming, trade, butchering, etc.), predatory (hunting, butchering, or consuming wild game), or research context.\nRecently, there has been a rise in frequency of appearance of new zoonotic diseases. \"Approximately 1.67 million undescribed viruses are thought to exist in mammals and birds, up to half of which are estimated to have the potential to spill over into humans\", says a study led by researchers at the University of California, Davis. According to a report from the United Nations Environment Programme and International Livestock Research Institute a large part of the causes are environmental like climate change, unsustainable agriculture, exploitation of wildlife, and land use change. Others are linked to changes in human society such as an increase in mobility. The organizations propose a set of measures to stop the rise.\nContamination of food or water supply.\nFoodborne zoonotic diseases are caused by a variety of pathogens that can affect both humans and animals. The most significant zoonotic pathogens causing foodborne diseases are:\nBacterial pathogens.\n, \"Campylobacter\", \"Caliciviridae\", and \"Salmonella\".\nFarming, ranching and animal husbandry.\nContact with farm animals can lead to disease in farmers or others that come into contact with infected farm animals. Glanders primarily affects those who work closely with horses and donkeys. Close contact with cattle can lead to cutaneous anthrax infection, whereas inhalation anthrax infection is more common for workers in slaughterhouses, tanneries, and wool mills. Close contact with sheep who have recently given birth can lead to infection with the bacterium \"Chlamydia psittaci,\" causing chlamydiosis (and enzootic abortion in pregnant women), as well as increase the risk of Q fever, toxoplasmosis, and listeriosis, in the pregnant or otherwise immunocompromised. Echinococcosis is caused by a tapeworm, which can spread from infected sheep by food or water contaminated by feces or wool. Avian influenza is common in chickens, and, while it is rare in humans, the main public health worry is that a strain of avian influenza will recombine with a human influenza virus and cause a pandemic like the 1918 Spanish flu. In 2017, free-range chickens in the UK were temporarily ordered to remain inside due to the threat of avian influenza. Cattle are an important reservoir of cryptosporidiosis, which mainly affects the immunocompromised. Reports have shown mink can also become infected. In Western countries, hepatitis E burden is largely dependent on exposure to animal products, and pork is a significant source of infection, in this respect. Similarly, the human coronavirus OC43, the main cause of the common cold, can use the pig as a zoonotic reservoir, constantly reinfecting the human population.\nVeterinarians are exposed to unique occupational hazards when it comes to zoonotic disease. In the US, studies have highlighted an increased risk of injuries and lack of veterinary awareness of these hazards. Research has proved the importance for continued clinical veterinarian education on occupational risks associated with musculoskeletal injuries, animal bites, needle-sticks, and cuts.\nA July 2020 report by the United Nations Environment Programme stated that the increase in zoonotic pandemics is directly attributable to anthropogenic destruction of nature and the increased global demand for meat and that the industrial farming of pigs and chickens in particular will be a primary risk factor for the spillover of zoonotic diseases in the future. Habitat loss of viral reservoir species has been identified as a significant source in at least one spillover event.\nWildlife trade or animal attacks.\nThe wildlife trade may increase spillover risk because it directly increases the number of interactions across animal species, sometimes in small spaces. The origin of the COVID-19 pandemic is traced to the wet markets in China.\nZoonotic disease emergence is demonstrably linked to the consumption of wildlife meat, exacerbated by human encroachment into natural habitats and amplified by the unsanitary conditions of wildlife markets. These markets, where diverse species converge, facilitate the mixing and transmission of pathogens, including those responsible for outbreaks of HIV-1, Ebola, and mpox, and potentially even the COVID-19 pandemic. Notably, small mammals often harbor a vast array of zoonotic bacteria and viruses, yet endemic bacterial transmission among wildlife remains largely unexplored. Therefore, accurately determining the pathogenic landscape of traded wildlife is crucial for guiding effective measures to combat zoonotic diseases and documenting the societal and environmental costs associated with this practice.\nPets.\nPets can transmit a number of diseases. Dogs and cats are routinely vaccinated against rabies. Pets can also transmit ringworm and \"Giardia\", which are endemic in both animal and human populations. Toxoplasmosis is a common infection of cats; in humans it is a mild disease although it can be dangerous to pregnant women. Dirofilariasis is caused by \"Dirofilaria immitis\" through mosquitoes infected by mammals like dogs and cats. Cat-scratch disease is caused by \"Bartonella henselae\" and \"Bartonella quintana\", which are transmitted by fleas that are endemic to cats. Toxocariasis is the infection of humans by any of species of roundworm, including species specific to dogs (\"Toxocara canis)\" or cats (\"Toxocara cati\"). Cryptosporidiosis can be spread to humans from pet lizards, such as the leopard gecko. \"Encephalitozoon cuniculi\" is a microsporidial parasite carried by many mammals, including rabbits, and is an important opportunistic pathogen in people immunocompromised by HIV/AIDS, organ transplantation, or CD4+ T-lymphocyte deficiency.\nPets may also serve as a reservoir of viral disease and contribute to the chronic presence of certain viral diseases in the human population. For instance, approximately 20% of domestic dogs, cats, and horses carry anti-hepatitis E virus antibodies and thus these animals probably contribute to human hepatitis E burden as well. For non-vulnerable populations (e.g., people who are not immunocompromised) the associated disease burden is, however, small. Furthermore, the trade of non-domestic animals such as wild animals as pets can also increase the risk of zoonosis spread.\nBats are frequently unjustly portrayed as the primary instigators of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic; nevertheless, the true origins of this and other zoonotic spillover occurrences should be attributed to human environmental impacts, especially the proliferation of pets. For example, bat predation by cats poses a significant danger to biodiversity conservation and carries zoonotic consequences that must be acknowledged.\nExhibition.\nOutbreaks of zoonoses have been traced to human interaction with, and exposure to, other animals at fairs, live animal markets, petting zoos, and other settings. In 2005, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued an updated list of recommendations for preventing zoonosis transmission in public settings. The recommendations, developed in conjunction with the National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians, include educational responsibilities of venue operators, limiting public animal contact, and animal care and management.\nHunting and bushmeat.\nHunting involves humans tracking, chasing, and capturing wild animals, primarily for food or materials like fur. However, other reasons like pest control or managing wildlife populations can also exist. Transmission of zoonotic diseases, those leaping from animals to humans, can occur through various routes: direct physical contact, airborne droplets or particles, bites or vector transport by insects, oral ingestion, or even contact with contaminated environments. Wildlife activities like hunting and trade bring humans closer to dangerous zoonotic pathogens, threatening global health.\nAccording to the Center for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) hunting and consuming wild animal meat (\"bushmeat\") in regions like Africa can expose people to infectious diseases due to the types of animals involved, like bats and primates. Unfortunately, common preservation methods like smoking or drying aren't enough to eliminate these risks. Although bushmeat provides protein and income for many, the practice is intricately linked to numerous emerging infectious diseases like Ebola, HIV, and SARS, raising critical public health concerns.\nA review published in 2022 found evidence that zoonotic spillover linked to wildmeat consumption has been reported across all continents.\nDeforestation, biodiversity loss and environmental degradation.\nKate Jones, Chair of Ecology and Biodiversity at University College London, says zoonotic diseases are increasingly linked to environmental change and human behavior. The disruption of pristine forests driven by logging, mining, road building through remote places, rapid urbanization, and population growth is bringing people into closer contact with animal species they may never have been near before. The resulting transmission of disease from wildlife to humans, she says, is now \"a hidden cost of human economic development\". In a guest article, published by IPBES, President of the EcoHealth Alliance and zoologist Peter Daszak, along with three co-chairs of the 2019 \"Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services\", Josef Settele, Sandra D\u00edaz, and Eduardo Brondizio, wrote that \"rampant deforestation, uncontrolled expansion of agriculture, intensive farming, mining and infrastructure development, as well as the exploitation of wild species have created a 'perfect storm' for the spillover of diseases from wildlife to people.\"\nJoshua Moon, Clare Wenham, and Sophie Harman said that there is evidence that decreased biodiversity has an effect on the diversity of hosts and frequency of human-animal interactions with potential for pathogenic spillover.\nAn April 2020 study, published in the \"Proceedings of the Royal Society\"'s journal, found that increased virus spillover events from animals to humans can be linked to biodiversity loss and environmental degradation, as humans further encroach on wildlands to engage in agriculture, hunting, and resource extraction they become exposed to pathogens which normally would remain in these areas. Such spillover events have been tripling every decade since 1980. An August 2020 study, published in \"Nature\", concludes that the anthropogenic destruction of ecosystems for the purpose of expanding agriculture and human settlements reduces biodiversity and allows for smaller animals such as bats and rats, which are more adaptable to human pressures and also carry the most zoonotic diseases, to proliferate. This in turn can result in more pandemics.\nIn October 2020, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services published its report on the 'era of pandemics' by 22 experts in a variety of fields and concluded that anthropogenic destruction of biodiversity is paving the way to the pandemic era and could result in as many as 850,000 viruses being transmitted from animals \u2013 in particular birds and mammals \u2013 to humans. The increased pressure on ecosystems is being driven by the \"exponential rise\" in consumption and trade of commodities such as meat, palm oil, and metals, largely facilitated by developed nations, and by a growing human population. According to Peter Daszak, the chair of the group who produced the report, \"there is no great mystery about the cause of the Covid-19 pandemic, or of any modern pandemic. The same human activities that drive climate change and biodiversity loss also drive pandemic risk through their impacts on our environment.\"\nClimate change.\nAccording to a report from the United Nations Environment Programme and International Livestock Research Institute, entitled \"Preventing the next pandemic \u2013 Zoonotic diseases and how to break the chain of transmission\", climate change is one of the 7 human-related causes of the increase in the number of zoonotic diseases. The University of Sydney issued a study, in March 2021, that examines factors increasing the likelihood of epidemics and pandemics like the COVID-19 pandemic. The researchers found that \"pressure on ecosystems, climate change and economic development are key factors\" in doing so. More zoonotic diseases were found in high-income countries.\nA 2022 study dedicated to the link between climate change and zoonosis found a strong link between climate change and the epidemic emergence in the last 15 years, as it caused a massive migration of species to new areas, and consequently contact between species which do not normally come in contact with one another. Even in a scenario with weak climatic changes, there will be 15,000 spillover of viruses to new hosts in the next decades. The areas with the most possibilities for spillover are the mountainous tropical regions of Africa and southeast Asia. Southeast Asia is especially vulnerable as it has a large number of bat species that generally do not mix, but could easily if climate change forced them to begin migrating.\nA 2021 study found possible links between climate change and transmission of COVID-19 through bats. The authors suggest that climate-driven changes in the distribution and robustness of bat species harboring coronaviruses may have occurred in eastern Asian hotspots (southern China, Myanmar, and Laos), constituting a driver behind the evolution and spread of the virus.\nSecondary transmission.\nZoonotic diseases contribute significantly to the burdened public health system as vulnerable groups such the elderly, children, childbearing women and immune-compromised individuals are at risk. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), any disease or infection that is primarily \"naturally\" transmissible from vertebrate animals to humans or from humans to animals is classified as a zoonosis. Factors such as climate change, urbanization, animal migration and trade, travel and tourism, vector biology, anthropogenic factors, and natural factors have greatly influenced the emergence, re-emergence, distribution, and patterns of zoonoses.\nZoonotic diseases generally refer to diseases of animal origin in which direct or vector mediated animal-to-human transmission is the usual source of human infection. Animal populations are the principal reservoir of the pathogen and horizontal infection in humans is rare. A few examples in this category include lyssavirus infections, Lyme borreliosis, plague, tularemia, leptospirosis, ehrlichiosis, Nipah virus, West Nile virus, and hantavirus infections. Secondary transmission encompasses a category of diseases of animal origin in which the actual transmission to humans is a rare event but, once it has occurred, human-to-human transmission maintains the infection cycle for some period of time. Some examples include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), certain influenza A strains, Ebola virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).\nOne example is Ebola, which is spread by direct transmission to humans from handling bushmeat (wild animals hunted for food) and contact with infected bats or close contact with infected animals, including chimpanzees, fruit bats, and forest antelope. Secondary transmission also occurs from human to human by direct contact with blood, bodily fluids, or skin of patients with or who died of Ebola virus disease. Some examples of pathogens with this pattern of secondary transmission are human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome, influenza A, Ebola virus, and SARS. Recent infections of these emerging and re-emerging zoonotic infections have occurred as a results of many ecological and sociological changes globally.\nHistory.\nDuring most of human prehistory groups of hunter-gatherers were probably very small. Such groups probably made contact with other such bands only rarely. Such isolation would have caused epidemic diseases to be restricted to any given local population, because propagation and expansion of epidemics depend on frequent contact with other individuals who have not yet developed an adequate immune response. To persist in such a population, a pathogen either had to be a chronic infection, staying present and potentially infectious in the infected host for long periods, or it had to have other additional species as reservoir where it can maintain itself until further susceptible hosts are contacted and infected. In fact, for many \"human\" diseases, the human is actually better viewed as an accidental or incidental victim and a dead-end host. Examples include rabies, anthrax, tularemia, and West Nile fever. Thus, much of human exposure to infectious disease has been zoonotic.\nMany diseases, even epidemic ones, have zoonotic origin and measles, smallpox, influenza, HIV, and diphtheria are particular examples. Various forms of the common cold and tuberculosis also are adaptations of strains originating in other species. Some experts have suggested that all human viral infections were originally zoonotic.\nZoonoses are of interest because they are often previously unrecognized diseases or have increased virulence in populations lacking immunity. The West Nile virus first appeared in the United States in 1999, in the New York City area. Bubonic plague is a zoonotic disease, as are salmonellosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and Lyme disease.\nA major factor contributing to the appearance of new zoonotic pathogens in human populations is increased contact between humans and wildlife. This can be caused either by encroachment of human activity into wilderness areas or by movement of wild animals into areas of human activity. An example of this is the outbreak of Nipah virus in peninsular Malaysia, in 1999, when intensive pig farming began within the habitat of infected fruit bats. The unidentified infection of these pigs amplified the force of infection, transmitting the virus to farmers, and eventually causing 105 human deaths.\nSimilarly, in recent times avian influenza and West Nile virus have spilled over into human populations probably due to interactions between the carrier host and domestic animals. Highly mobile animals, such as bats and birds, may present a greater risk of zoonotic transmission than other animals due to the ease with which they can move into areas of human habitation.\nBecause they depend on the human host for part of their life-cycle, diseases such as African schistosomiasis, river blindness, and elephantiasis are \"not\" defined as zoonotic, even though they may depend on transmission by insects or other vectors.\nUse in vaccines.\nThe first vaccine against smallpox by Edward Jenner in 1800 was by infection of a zoonotic bovine virus which caused a disease called cowpox. Jenner had noticed that milkmaids were resistant to smallpox. Milkmaids contracted a milder version of the disease from infected cows that conferred cross immunity to the human disease. Jenner abstracted an infectious preparation of 'cowpox' and subsequently used it to inoculate persons against smallpox. As a result of vaccination, smallpox has been eradicated globally, and mass inoculation against this disease ceased in 1981. There are a variety of vaccine types, including traditional inactivated pathogen vaccines, subunit vaccines, live attenuated vaccines. There are also new vaccine technologies such as viral vector vaccines and DNA/RNA vaccines, which include many of the COVID-19 vaccines.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Zeppelin's notions were first formulated in 1874 and developed in detail in 1893. They were patented in Germany in 1895 and in the United States in 1899. After the outstanding success of the Zeppelin design, the word \"zeppelin\" came to be commonly used to refer to all forms of rigid airships. Zeppelins were first flown commercially in 1910 by Deutsche Luftschiffahrts-AG (DELAG), the world's first airline in revenue service. By mid-1914, DELAG had carried over 10,000 fare-paying passengers on over 1,500 flights. During World War I, the German military made extensive use of Zeppelins as bombers and as scouts. Numerous bombing raids on Britain resulted in over 500 deaths.\nThe defeat of Germany in 1918 temporarily slowed the airship business. Although DELAG established a scheduled daily service between Berlin, Munich, and Friedrichshafen in 1919, the airships built for that service eventually had to be surrendered under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, which also prohibited Germany from building large airships. An exception was made to allow the construction of one airship for the United States Navy, the order for which saved the company from extinction.\nIn 1926, the restrictions on airship construction were lifted and, with the aid of donations from the public, work began on the construction of LZ 127 \"Graf Zeppelin\". That revived the company's fortunes and, during the 1930s, the airships \"Graf Zeppelin\", and the even larger LZ 129 \"Hindenburg\" operated regular transatlantic flights from Germany to North America and Brazil. The spire of the Empire State Building was originally designed to serve as a mooring mast for Zeppelins and other airships, although it was found that high winds made that impossible and the plan was abandoned. The \"Hindenburg\" disaster in 1937, along with political and economic developments in Germany in the lead-up to World War II, hastened the demise of airships.\nPrincipal characteristics.\nThe principal feature of the Zeppelin's design was a fabric-covered, rigid metal framework of transverse rings and longitudinal girders enclosing many individual gasbags or cells, which were filled with flammable hydrogen (H\u2082) \u2013 the only practical lifting gas available to German engineers at the time. This structure allowed the craft to be much larger than non-rigid airships, which relied on the inflation of a single pressure envelope to maintain their shape. Most Zeppelins used duralumin for the framework \u2013 a combination of aluminium, copper, and two or three other metals, the exact composition of which was kept secret for years. In early models, the gasbags were made of rubberized cotton, but most later craft used goldbeater's skin derived from cattle gut.\nThe first Zeppelins had long cylindrical hulls with tapered ends and complex multi-plane fins. During World War I, following the lead of the rival firm Sch\u00fctte-Lanz Luftschiffbau, almost all later airships changed to the more familiar streamlined shape with cruciform tail fins.\nZeppelins were propelled by several internal combustion engines, mounted in gondolas or engine cars attached outside the structural framework. Some of these could provide reverse thrust for manoeuvring while mooring.\nEarly models had a fairly small externally-mounted gondola for passengers and crew beneath the frame. This space was never heated, because fire outside of the kitchen was considered too risky, and during trips across the North Atlantic or Siberia, passengers were forced to bundle in blankets and furs to keep warm and were often miserably cold.\nBy the time of the \"Hindenburg\", several important changes had made traveling much more comfortable: the passenger space had been relocated to the interior of the framework, passenger rooms were insulated from the exterior by the dining area, and forced warm air could be circulated from the water that cooled the forward engines. The new design did prevent passengers from enjoying the views from the windows of their berths, which had been a major attraction on the \"Graf Zeppelin\". On both the older and newer vessels, the external viewing windows were often open during flight. The flight altitude was so low that no pressurization of the cabins was necessary. The \"Hindenburg\" did maintain a pressurized air-locked smoking room: no flame was allowed, but a single electric lighter was provided, which could not be removed from the room.\nAccess to Zeppelins was achieved in several ways. The \"Graf Zeppelin\"'s gondola was accessed while the vessel was on the ground, via gangways. The \"Hindenburg\" also had passenger gangways leading from the ground directly into its hull, which could be withdrawn entirely, ground access to the gondola, and an exterior access hatch via its electrical room; the latter was intended for crew use only.\nOn some long-distance zeppelins, engines were powered by a special Blau gas produced by the Zeppelin facility in Friedrichshafen. The combustible Blau gas was formulated to make its weight near that of air, so that its storage and consumption had little effect on the Zeppelin's buoyancy. Blau gas was used on the first Zeppelin voyage to the United States, starting in 1929.\nHistory.\nEarly designs.\nCount Ferdinand von Zeppelin's interest in airship development began in 1874, when he was inspired by a lecture given by Heinrich von Stephan on the subject of \"World Postal Services and Air Travel\" to outline the basic principle of his later craft in a diary entry dated 25 March 1874. It describes a large rigidly framed outer envelope containing several separate gasbags. He had previously encountered Union Army balloons in 1863 when he visited the United States as a military observer during the American Civil War.\nCount Zeppelin began to seriously pursue his project after his early retirement from the army in 1890 at the age of 52. Convinced of the potential importance of aviation, he started working on various designs in 1891 and had completed detailed designs by 1893. An official committee reviewed his plans in 1894, and he received a patent, granted on 31 August 1895, with Theodor Kober producing the technical drawings.\nZeppelin's patent described a \"\" (\"Steerable aircraft with several carrier bodies arranged one behind another\"), an airship consisting of flexibly articulated rigid sections. The front section, containing the crew and engines, was long with a gas capacity of . The middle section was long with an intended useful load of and the rear section long with an intended load of .\nCount Zeppelin's attempts to secure government funding for his project proved unsuccessful, but a lecture given to the Union of German Engineers gained their support. Zeppelin also sought support from the industrialist Carl Berg, then engaged in construction work on the second airship design of David Schwarz. Berg was under contract not to supply aluminium to any other airship manufacturer, and subsequently made a payment to Schwarz's widow as compensation for breaking this agreement. Schwarz's design differed fundamentally from Zeppelin's, crucially lacking the use of separate gasbags inside a rigid envelope.\nIn 1898, Count Zeppelin founded the \"Gesellschaft zur F\u00f6rderung der Luftschiffahrt\" (\"Society for the Promotion of Airship Flight\"), personally contributing more than half of its 800,000-mark share capital \u2014 a sum broadly equivalent to \u20ac6.65 million in early 2010s terms, based on historical gold value and purchasing power estimates. Responsibility for the detailed design was given to Kober, whose place was later taken by Ludwig D\u00fcrr, and construction of the first airship began in 1899 in a floating assembly-hall or hangar in the Bay of Manzell near Friedrichshafen on Lake Constance (the \"Bodensee\"). The intention behind the floating hall was to facilitate the difficult task of bringing the airship out of the hall, as it could easily be aligned with the wind. The LZ 1 (LZ for \"Luftschiff Zeppelin\", or \"Zeppelin Airship\") was long with a hydrogen capacity of , was driven by two Daimler engines each driving a pair of propellers mounted either side of the envelope via bevel gears and a driveshaft, and was controlled in pitch by moving a weight between its two nacelles.\nThe first flight took place over Lake Constance on 2 July 1900. Damaged during landing, it was repaired and modified and proved its potential in two subsequent flights made on 17 and 24 October 1900, bettering the 6 m/s () velocity attained by the French airship \"La France\". Despite this performance, the shareholders declined to invest more money, and so the company was liquidated, with Count von Zeppelin purchasing the ship and equipment. The Count wished to continue experimenting, but he eventually dismantled the ship in 1901.\nDonations, the profits of a special lottery, some public funding, a mortgage of Count von Zeppelin's wife's estate, and a 100,000 mark contribution by Count von Zeppelin himself allowed the construction of LZ 2, which made only a single flight on 17 January 1906. After both engines failed, it made a forced landing in the Allg\u00e4u mountains, where a storm subsequently damaged the anchored ship beyond repair.\nIncorporating all the usable parts of LZ 2, its successor LZ 3 became the first truly successful Zeppelin. This renewed the interest of the German military, but a condition of purchase of an airship was a 24-hour endurance trial. This was beyond the capabilities of LZ 3, leading Zeppelin to construct his fourth design, the LZ 4, first flown on 20 June 1908. On 1 July, it was flown over Switzerland to Z\u00fcrich and then back to Lake Constance, covering and reaching an altitude of . An attempt to complete the 24-hour trial flight ended when LZ 4 had to make a landing at Echterdingen near Stuttgart because of mechanical problems. During the stop, a storm tore the airship away from its moorings on the afternoon of 5 August 1908. It crashed into a tree, caught fire, and quickly burned out. No one was seriously injured.\nThis accident would have finished Zeppelin's experiments, but his flights had generated huge public interest and a sense of national pride regarding his work, and spontaneous donations from the public began pouring in, eventually totalling over six million marks. This enabled the Count to found the \"Luftschiffbau Zeppelin GmbH\" (Airship Construction Zeppelin Ltd.) and the Zeppelin Foundation.\nBefore World War I.\nBefore World War I (1914\u20131918), the Zeppelin company manufactured 21 more airships. The Imperial German Army bought LZ 3 and LZ 5 (a sister-ship to LZ 4, which was completed in May 1909) and designated them Z I and Z II respectively. Z II was wrecked in a gale in April 1910, while Z I flew until 1913, when it was decommissioned and replaced by LZ 15, designated \"ersatz\" Z I. First flown on 16 January 1913, it was wrecked on 19 March.\nIn April 1913, its newly built sister-ship LZ 15 (Z IV) accidentally intruded into French airspace owing to a navigational error caused by high winds and poor visibility. The commander judged it proper to land the airship to demonstrate that the incursion was accidental, and brought the ship down on the military parade-ground at Lun\u00e9ville. The airship remained on the ground until the following day, permitting a detailed examination by French airship experts.\nIn 1909, Count Zeppelin founded the world's first airline, the Deutsche Luftschiffahrts-Aktiengesellschaft (German Airship Travel Corporation), generally known as DELAG to promote his airships, initially using LZ 6, which he had hoped to sell to the German Army. Notable aviation figures like Orville Wright offered critical perspectives on the Zeppelin; in a September 1909 New York Times interview, Wright compared airships to steam engines nearing their developmental peak, while seeing airplanes as akin to gas engines with untapped innovation potential. The airships did not provide a scheduled service between cities, but generally operated pleasure cruises, carrying twenty passengers. The airships were given names in addition to their production numbers. LZ 6 first flew on 25 August 1909 and was accidentally destroyed in Baden-Oos on 14 September 1910 by a fire in its hangar.\nThe second DELAG airship, LZ 7 \"Deutschland\", made its maiden voyage on 19 June 1910. On 28 June, it set off on a voyage to publicise Zeppelins, carrying 19 journalists as passengers. A combination of adverse weather and engine failure brought it down at Mount Limberg near Bad Iburg in Lower Saxony, its hull getting stuck in trees. All passengers and crew were unhurt, except for one crew member who broke his leg when he jumped from the craft. \nIt was replaced by LZ 8 \"Deutschland II\", which also had a short career, first flying on 30 March 1911 and becoming damaged beyond repair when caught by a strong cross-wind while being walked out of its shed on 16 May. The company's fortunes changed with the next ship, LZ 10 \"Schwaben\", which first flew on 26 June 1911 and carried 1,553 passengers in 218 flights before catching fire after a gust tore it from its mooring near D\u00fcsseldorf. Other DELAG ships included LZ 11 \"Viktoria Luise\" (1912), LZ 13 \"Hansa\" (1912) and LZ 17 \"Sachsen\" (1913). By the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, 1588 flights had carried 10,197 fare-paying passengers.\nOn 24 April 1912, the Imperial German Navy ordered its first Zeppelin\u2014an enlarged version of the airships operated by DELAG\u2014which received the naval designation Z 1 and entered Navy service in October 1912. On 18 January 1913, Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, Secretary of State of the German Imperial Naval Office, obtained the agreement of Kaiser Wilhelm II to a five-year program of expansion of German naval-airship strength, involving the building of two airship bases and constructing a fleet of ten airships. The first airship of the program, L 2, was ordered on 30 January. L 1 was lost on 9 September near Heligoland when caught in a storm while taking part in an exercise with the German fleet. 14 crew members drowned, the first fatalities in a Zeppelin accident. \nLess than six weeks later, on 17 October, LZ 18 (L 2) caught fire during its acceptance trials, killing the entire crew. These accidents deprived the Navy of most of its experienced personnel: the head of the Admiralty Air Department was killed in the L 1 and his successor died in the L 2. The Navy was left with three partially trained crews. The next Navy zeppelin, the M class L 3, did not enter service until May 1914: in the meantime, \"Sachsen\" was hired from DELAG as a training ship.\nBy the outbreak of war in August 1914, Zeppelin had started constructing the first M class airships, which had a length of , with a volume of and a useful load of . Their three Maybach C-X engines produced each, and they could reach speeds of up to .\nDuring World War I.\nDuring World War I, Germany\u2019s airships were operated separately by the Army and the Navy. At the war\u2019s outset, the Army assumed control of the three remaining DELAG airships, having already decommissioned three older Zeppelins, including Z I. Throughout the war, the Navy primarily used its Zeppelins for reconnaissance missions.\nAlthough Zeppelin bombing raids, especially those aimed at London, captivated the German public\u2019s imagination, they had limited material success. Nevertheless, these raids\u2014along with later bombing raids by airplanes\u2014led to the diversion of men and resources from the Western Front. Additionally, the fear of these attacks impacted industrial production to some extent.\nEarly offensive operations by Army airships quickly revealed their extreme vulnerability to ground fire when flown at low altitudes, leading to the loss of several airships. Since no dedicated bombs had been developed at the time, these early raids dropped artillery shells instead.\nOn 20 March 1915, temporarily forbidden from bombing London by the Kaiser, Z X (LZ 29), LZ 35 and the Sch\u00fctte-Lanz airship SL 2 set off to bomb Paris: SL 2 was damaged by artillery fire while crossing the front and turned back but the two Zeppelins reached Paris and dropped of bombs, killing only one and wounding eight. On the return journey, Z X was damaged by anti-aircraft fire and was damaged beyond repair in the resulting forced landing. Three weeks later LZ 35 suffered a similar fate after bombing Poperinghe.\nParis mounted a more effective defense against zeppelin raids than London. Zeppelins attacking Paris had to first fly over the system of forts between the front and the city, from which they were subjected to anti-aircraft fire with reduced risk of collateral damage. The French also maintained a continuous patrol of two fighters over Paris at an altitude from which they could promptly attack arriving zeppelins, avoiding the delay required to reach the zeppelin altitude. Two further missions were flown against Paris in January 1916: on 29 January, LZ 79 killed 23 and injured another 30 but was so severely damaged by anti-aircraft fire that it crashed during the return journey. A second mission by LZ 77 the following night, bombed the suburbs of Asni\u00e8res and Versailles, with little effect.\nAirship operations in the Balkans started in the autumn of 1915, and an airship base was constructed at Szentandras. In November 1915, LZ 81 was used to fly diplomats to Sofia for negotiations with the Bulgarian government. This base was also used by LZ 85 to conduct two raids on Salonika in early 1916: a third raid on 4 May ended with it being brought down by anti-aircraft fire. The crew survived but were taken prisoner. \nWhen Romania entered the war in August 1916, LZ 101 was transferred to Yambol and bombed Bucharest on 28 August, 4 September, and 25 September. LZ 86 transferred to Szentandras and made a single attack on the Ploie\u0219ti oil fields on 4 September but was wrecked on attempting to land after the mission. Its replacement, LZ 86, was damaged by anti-aircraft fire during its second attack on Bucharest on 26 September and was damaged beyond repair in the resulting forced landing, and was replaced by LZ 97.\nAt the instigation of the Kaiser, a plan was made to bomb Saint Petersburg in December 1916. Two Navy zeppelins were transferred to Wainoden on the Courland Peninsula. A preliminary attempt to bomb Reval on 28 December ended in failure caused by operating problems due to the extreme cold, and one of the airships was destroyed in a forced landing at Seerappen. The plan was subsequently abandoned.\nIn 1917, the German High Command attempted to use a Zeppelin to deliver supplies to Lettow-Vorbeck's forces in German East Africa. L 57, a specially lengthened craft, was to have flown the mission but was destroyed shortly after completion. A Zeppelin then under construction, L 59, was then modified for the mission: it set off from Yambol on 21 November 1917 and nearly reached its destination, but was ordered to return by radio. Its journey covered and lasted 95 hours. \nIt was then used for reconnaissance and bombing missions in the eastern Mediterranean. It flew one bombing mission against Naples on 10\u201311 March 1918. A planned attack on Suez was turned back by high winds. On 7 April 1918, it was on a mission to bomb the British naval base at Malta when it caught fire over the Straits of Otranto, with the loss of all its crew.\nOn 5 January 1918, a fire at Ahlhorn destroyed four of the specialised double sheds along with four Zeppelins and one Sch\u00fctte-Lanz. In July 1918, the Tondern raid conducted by the RAF and Royal Navy destroyed two Zeppelins in their sheds.\n1914\u20131918 naval patrols.\nThe main use of the airship was in reconnaissance over the North Sea and the Baltic, and the majority of airships manufactured were used by the Navy. Patrolling had priority over any other airship activity. During the war, almost 1,000 missions were flown over the North Sea alone, compared with about 50 strategic bombing raids. The German Navy had some 15 Zeppelins in commission by the end of 1915 and was able to have two or more patrolling continuously at any one time. Their operations were limited by weather conditions.\nOn 17 February 1915, Zeppelins L 3 and L 4 were lost due to a combination of engine failure, icing, and high winds. L 3 crash-landed on the Danish island of Fan\u00f8 without loss of life. L 4 made an emergency landing at B\u00f8rsmose Beach on the Jutland mainland, damaging its forward gondola. Eleven crew escaped, but the airship reascended unintentionally, carrying four mechanics out to sea. All four were presumed drowned.\nAt this stage in the war, there was no clear doctrine for the use of Naval airships. A single large Zeppelin, L 5, played an unimportant part in the Battle of the Dogger Bank on 24 January 1915. L 5 was carrying out a routine patrol when it picked up Admiral Hipper's radio signal announcing that he was engaged with the British battle cruiser squadron. Heading towards the German fleet's position, the Zeppelin was forced to climb above the cloud cover by fire from the British fleet: its commander then decided that it was his duty to cover the retreating German fleet rather than observe British movements.\nIn 1915, patrols were only carried out on 124 days, and in other years the total was considerably less. They prevented British ships from approaching Germany, spotted when and where the British were laying mines, and later aided in the destruction of those mines. Zeppelins would sometimes land on the sea next to a minesweeper, bring aboard an officer, and show him the mines' locations.\nIn 1917, the Royal Navy began to take effective countermeasures against airship patrols over the North Sea. In April, the first Curtiss H.12 Large America long-range flying boats were delivered to RNAS Felixstowe, and in July 1917, the aircraft carrier entered service and launching platforms for aeroplanes were fitted to the forward turrets of some light cruisers. On 14 May, L 22 was shot down near Terschelling Bank by an H.12 flown by Lt. Galpin and Sub-Lt. Leckie, which had been alerted following the interception of its radio traffic. Two abortive interceptions were made by Galpin and Leckie on 24 May and 5 June. On 14 June, L 43 was brought down by an H.12 flown by Sub Lts. Hobbs and Dickie. On the same day, Galpin and Leckie intercepted and attacked L 46. The Germans had believed that the previous unsuccessful attacks had been made by an aircraft operating from one of the Royal Navy's seaplane carriers; now, realising that there was a new threat, Strasser ordered airships patrolling in the Terschilling area to maintain an altitude of at least , considerably reducing their effectiveness. On 21 August, L 23, patrolling off the Danish coast, was spotted by the British 3rd Light Cruiser squadron, which was in the area. launched its Sopwith Pup, and Sub-Lt. B. A. Smart succeeded in shooting the Zeppelin down in flames. The cause of the airship's loss was not discovered by the Germans, who believed the Zeppelin had been brought down by anti-aircraft fire from ships.\nBombing campaign against Britain.\nAt the beginning of the conflict, the German command had high hopes for the airships, which were considerably more capable than contemporary light fixed-wing machines: they were almost as fast, could carry multiple machine guns, and had enormously greater bomb-load range and endurance. Contrary to expectation, it was not easy to ignite the hydrogen using standard bullets and shrapnel. The Allies only started to exploit the Zeppelin's great vulnerability to fire when a combination of Pomeroy and Brock explosive ammunition with Buckingham incendiary ammunition was used in fighter aircraft machine guns during 1916. \nThe British had been concerned over the threat posed by Zeppelins since 1909, and attacked the Zeppelin bases early in the war. LZ 25 was destroyed in its hangar at D\u00fcsseldorf on 8 October 1914 by bombs dropped by Flt Lt Reginald Marix, RNAS, and the sheds at Cologne, while the Zeppelin works in Friedrichshafen were also attacked. These raids were followed by the Cuxhaven Raid on Christmas Day 1914, one of the first operations carried out by ship-launched aeroplanes.\nAirship raids on Great Britain were approved by the Kaiser on 7 January 1915, although he excluded London as a target and further demanded that no attacks be made on historic buildings. The raids were intended to target only military sites on the east coast and around the Thames estuary, but bombing accuracy was poor owing to the height at which the airships flew, and navigation was problematic. The airships relied largely on dead reckoning, supplemented by a radio direction-finding system of limited accuracy. After blackouts became widespread, many bombs fell at random on uninhabited countryside.\n1915.\nThe first raid on Britain took place on the night of 19\u201320 January 1915. Two Zeppelins, L 3 and L 4, intended to attack targets near the River Humber but, diverted by strong winds, eventually dropped their bombs on Great Yarmouth, Sheringham, King's Lynn and the surrounding villages, killing four and injuring 16. Material damage was estimated at \u00a37,740.\nThe Kaiser authorised the bombing of the London docks on 12 February 1915, but no raids on London took place until May. Two Navy raids failed due to bad weather on 14 and 15 April, and it was decided to delay further attempts until the more capable P class Zeppelins were in service. The Army received the first of these, LZ 38, and Erich Linnarz commanded it on a raid over Ipswich on 29\u201330 April and another, attacking Southend on 9\u201310 May. LZ 38 also attacked Dover and Ramsgate on 16\u201317 May, before returning to bomb Southend on 26\u201327 May. These four raids killed six people and injured six, causing property damage estimated at \u00a316,898. Twice, Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) aircraft tried to intercept LZ 38, but on both occasions, it was either able to outclimb the aircraft or was already at too great an altitude for the aircraft to intercept.\nOn 31 May, Linnarz commanded LZ 38 on the first raid against London. In total, some 120 bombs were dropped on a line stretching from Stoke Newington south to Stepney and then north toward Leytonstone. Seven people were killed and 35 were injured. 41 fires were started, burning out seven buildings, and the total damage was assessed at \u00a318,596. Aware of the problems that the Germans were experiencing in navigation, this raid caused the government to issue a D notice prohibiting the press from reporting anything about raids that was not mentioned in official statements. Only one of the 15 defensive sorties managed to make visual contact with the enemy, and one of the pilots, Flt Lieut D. M. Barnes, was killed on attempting to land.\nThe first naval attempt on London took place on 4 June: strong winds caused the commander of L 9 to misjudge his position, and the bombs were dropped on Gravesend. L 9 was also diverted by the weather on 6\u20137 June, attacking Hull instead of London and causing considerable damage. On the same night an Army raid of three Zeppelins also failed because of the weather, and as the airships returned to Evere (Brussels) they ran into a counter-raid by RNAS aircraft flying from Furnes, Belgium. LZ 38 was destroyed on the ground, and LZ 37 was intercepted in the air by R. A. J. Warneford, who dropped six bombs on the airship, setting it on fire. All but one of the crew died. Warneford was awarded the Victoria Cross for his achievement. As a consequence of the RNAS raid, both the Army and Navy withdrew from their bases in Belgium.\nAfter an ineffective attack by L 10 on Tyneside on 15\u201316 June, the short summer nights discouraged further raids for some months, and the remaining Army Zeppelins were reassigned to the Eastern and Balkan fronts. The Navy resumed raids on Britain in August, when three largely ineffective raids were carried out. On 10 August, the anti-aircraft guns had their first success, causing L 12 to come down into the sea off Zeebrugge, and on 17\u201318 August L 10 became the first Navy airship to reach London. Mistaking the reservoirs of the Lea Valley for the Thames, it dropped its bombs on Walthamstow and Leytonstone. L 10 was destroyed a little over two weeks later: it was struck by lightning and caught fire off Cuxhaven, and the entire crew was killed. Three Army airships set off to bomb London on 7\u20138 September, of which two succeeded: SL 2 dropped bombs between Southwark and Woolwich: LZ 74 scattered 39 bombs over Cheshunt before heading on to London and dropping a single bomb on Fenchurch Street station.\nThe Navy attempted to follow up on the Army's success the following night. One Zeppelin targeted the benzole plant at Skinningrove and three set off to bomb London: two were forced to turn back, but L 13, commanded by \"Kapit\u00e4nleutnant\" Heinrich Mathy, reached London. The bomb-load included a bomb, the largest yet carried. This exploded near Smithfield Market, destroying several houses and killing two men. More bombs fell on the textile warehouses north of St Paul's Cathedral, causing a fire which, despite the attendance of 22 fire engines, caused over half a million pounds of damage: Mathy then turned east, dropping his remaining bombs on Liverpool Street station. The Zeppelin was the target of concentrated anti-aircraft fire, but no hits were scored, and the falling shrapnel caused both damage and alarm on the ground. The raid killed 22 people and injured 87. The monetary cost of the damage was over one-sixth of the total damage costs inflicted by bombing raids during the war.\nAfter three more raids were scattered by the weather, a five-Zeppelin raid was launched by the Navy on 13 October, the \"Theatreland Raid.\" Arriving over the Norfolk coast at around 18:30, the Zeppelins encountered new ground defences installed since the September raid; these had no success, although the airship commanders commented on the improved defences of the city. L 15 began bombing over Charing Cross, the first bombs striking the Lyceum Theatre and the corner of Exeter and Wellington Streets, killing 17 and injuring 20. None of the other Zeppelins reached central London: bombs fell on Woolwich, Guildford, Tonbridge, Croydon, Hertford, and an army camp near Folkestone. A total of 71 people were killed and 128 injured. This was the last raid of 1915, as bad weather coincided with the new moon in both November and December 1915 and continued into January 1916.\nAlthough these raids had no significant military impact, the psychological effect was considerable. The writer D. H. Lawrence described one raid in a letter to Lady Ottoline Morrell:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Then we saw the Zeppelin above us, just ahead, amid a gleaming of clouds: high up, like a bright golden finger, quite small (...) Then there was flashes near the ground\u2014and the shaking noise. It was like Milton\u2014then there was war in heaven. (...) I cannot get over it, that the moon is not Queen of the sky by night, and the stars the lesser lights. It seems the Zeppelin is in the zenith of the night, golden like a moon, having taken control of the sky; and the bursting shells are the lesser lights.\n1916.\nThe raids continued in 1916. In December 1915, additional P-class Zeppelins and the first of the new Q-class airships were delivered. The Q-class was an enlargement of the P-class with improved ceiling and bomb-load.\nThe Army took full control of ground defences in February 1916, and a variety of sub 4-inch (less than 102 mm) calibre guns were converted to anti-aircraft use. Searchlights were introduced, initially manned by police. By mid-1916, there were 271 anti-aircraft guns and 258 searchlights across England. Aerial defences against Zeppelins were divided between the RNAS and the Royal Flying Corps (RFC), with the Navy engaging enemy airships approaching the coast while the RFC took responsibility once the enemy had crossed the coastline. Initially, the War Office had believed that the Zeppelins used a layer of inert gas to protect themselves from incendiary bullets and favoured the use of bombs or devices like the Ranken dart. However, by mid-1916, an effective mixture of explosive, tracer, and incendiary rounds had been developed. There were 23 airship raids in 1916, in which 125 tons of bombs were dropped, killing 293 people and injuring 691.\nThe first raid of 1916 was carried out by the German Navy. Nine Zeppelins were sent to Liverpool on the night of 31 January \u2013 1 February. A combination of poor weather and mechanical problems scattered them across the Midlands, and several towns were bombed. A total of 61 people were reported killed and 101 injured by the raid. Despite ground fog, 22 aircraft took off to find the Zeppelins, but none succeeded, and two pilots were killed when attempting to land. One airship, the L 19, came down in the North Sea because of engine failure and damage from Dutch ground-fire. Although the wreck stayed afloat for a while and was sighted by a British fishing trawler, the boat's crew refused to rescue the Zeppelin's crew because they were outnumbered, and all 16 crew died.\nFurther raids were delayed by an extended period of poor weather and also by the withdrawal of the majority of Naval Zeppelins in an attempt to resolve the recurrent engine failures. Three Zeppelins set off to bomb Rosyth on 5\u20136 March but were forced by high winds to divert to Hull, killing 18, injuring 52 and causing \u00a325,005 damage. At the beginning of April raids were attempted on five successive nights. Ten airships set off on 31 March: most turned back, and L 15, damaged by anti-aircraft fire and an aircraft attacking using Ranken darts, came down in the sea near Margate. Most of the 48 killed in the raid were victims of a single bomb which fell on an Army billet in Cleethorpes. The following night, two Navy Zeppelins bombed targets in the north of England, killing 22 and injuring 130. On the night of 2\u20133 April, a six-airship raid was made, targeting the naval base at Rosyth, the Forth Bridge and London. None of the airships bombed their intended targets; 13 were killed, 24 injured and much of the \u00a377,113 damage was caused by the destruction of a warehouse in Leith containing whisky. Raids on 4\u20135 April and 5\u20106 April had little effect, as did a five-Zeppelin raid on 25\u201326 April and a raid by a single Army Zeppelin the following night. On 2\u20133 July, a nine-Zeppelin raid against Manchester and Rosyth was largely ineffective due to weather conditions, and one was forced to land in neutral Denmark, its crew being interned.\nOn 28\u201329 July, the first raid to include one of the new and much larger R-class Zeppelins, L 31, took place. The 10-Zeppelin raid achieved very little; four turned back early and the rest wandered over a fog-covered landscape before giving up. Adverse weather dispersed raids on 30\u201331 July and 2\u20133 August, and on 8\u20139 August nine airships attacked Hull with little effect. On 24\u201325 August 12 Navy Zeppelins were launched: eight turned back without attacking and only Heinrich Mathy's L 31 reached London; flying above low clouds, 36 bombs were dropped in 10 minutes on south east London. Nine people were killed, 40 injured and \u00a3130,203 of damage was caused.\nZeppelins were very difficult to attack successfully at high altitude, although this also made accurate bombing impossible. Aeroplanes struggled to reach a typical altitude of , and firing the solid bullets usually used by aircraft guns was ineffectual: they only made small holes, causing inconsequential gas leaks. Britain developed new bullets, the Brock containing oxidant potassium chlorate, and the Buckingham filled with phosphorus, which reacted with the chlorate to catch fire and hence ignite the Zeppelin's hydrogen. These had become available by September 1916.\nThe biggest raid to date was launched on 2\u20133 September, when twelve German Navy and four Army airships set out to bomb London. A combination of rain and snowstorms scattered the airships while they were still over the North Sea. Only one of the naval airships came within seven miles of central London, and both damage and casualties were slight. The newly commissioned Sch\u00fctte-Lanz SL 11 dropped a few bombs on Hertfordshire while approaching London: it was picked up by searchlights as it bombed Ponders End and at around 02:15 it was intercepted by a B.E.2c flown by Lt. William Leefe Robinson, who fired three 40-round drums of Brocks and Buckingham ammunition into the airship. The third drum started a fire, and the airship was quickly enveloped in flames. It fell to the ground near Cuffley, witnessed by the crews of several of the other Zeppelins and many on the ground; there were no survivors. The victory earned Leefe Robinson a Victoria Cross; the pieces of SL 11 were gathered up and sold as souvenirs by the Red Cross to raise money for wounded soldiers.\nThe loss of SL 11 to the new ammunition ended the German Army's enthusiasm for raids on Britain. The German Navy remained aggressive, and another 12-Zeppelin raid was launched on 23\u201324 September. Eight older airships bombed targets in the Midlands and northeast, while four R-class Zeppelins attacked London. L 30 did not even cross the coast, dropping its bombs at sea. L 31 approached London from the south, dropping a few bombs on the southern suburbs before crossing the Thames and bombing Leyton, killing eight people and injuring 30.\nL 32 was piloted by \"Oberleutnant\" Werner Peterson of the Naval Airship Service, who had only taken command of L 32 in August 1916. L 32 approached from the south, crossing the English Channel close to Dungeness lighthouse, passing Tunbridge Wells at 12:10 and dropping bombs on Sevenoaks and Swanley before crossing over Purfleet. After receiving heavy gunfire and encountering a multitude of anti-aircraft search lights over London, Peterson decided to head up the Essex coast from Tilbury and abort the mission. Water ballast was dropped to gain altitude, and L 32 climbed to 13,000 feet. Shortly afterwards, at 12:45 L 32 was spotted by 2nd Lieutenant Frederick Sowrey of the Royal Flying Corps, who had taken off from nearby RAF Hornchurch (known at the time as Sutton's Farm). As Sowrey approached, he fired three drums of ammunition into the hull of L 32, including the latest Bock &amp; Pomeroy incendiary rounds. L 32, according to witness accounts, violently turned and lost altitude, burning from both ends and along its back. The airship narrowly missed Billericay High Street as it passed over, one witness saying the windows to her home rattled and the Zeppelin sounded like a hissing freight train. L 32 continued down Hillside and came down at Snail's Hall Farm off Green Farm Lane in Great Burstead, crashing at 01:30 on farm land; the 650-foot-long airship struck a large oak tree.\nThe entire 22 crew was killed. Two crew members jumped rather than be burned (one was said to be Werner Peterson). The crew's bodies were kept in a barn nearby until 27 September, when the Royal Flying Corps transported them to nearby Great Burstead Church. They were interred there until 1966, when they were reinterred at the German Military Cemetery in Cannock Chase. Attending the scene of the crash site were the Royal Naval Intelligence, who recovered the latest secret code book, which was found within the gondola of the crashed L32.\nL 33 dropped a few incendiaries over Upminster and Bromley-by-Bow, where it was hit by an anti-aircraft shell, despite being at an altitude of . As it headed towards Chelmsford, it began to lose height and came down close to Little Wigborough.\nThe airship was set alight by its crew, but inspection of the wreckage provided the British with much information about the construction of Zeppelins, which was used in the design of the British R33-class airships.\nThe next raid came on 1 October 1916. Eleven Zeppelins were launched at targets in the Midlands and at London. Only L 31, commanded by the experienced Heinrich Mathy, making his 15th raid, reached London. As the airship neared Cheshunt at about 23:20, it was picked up by searchlights and attacked by three aircraft from No. 39 Squadron. 2nd Lieutenant Wulstan Tempest succeeded in setting fire to the airship, which came down near Potters Bar. All 19 crew died, many jumping from the burning airship.\nFor the next raid, on 27\u201328 November, the Zeppelins avoided London for targets in the Midlands. Again the defending aircraft were successful: L 34 was shot down over the mouth of the Tees and L 21 was attacked by two aircraft and crashed into the sea off Lowestoft. There were no further raids in 1916 although the Navy lost three more craft, all on 28 December: SL 12 was destroyed at Ahlhorn by strong winds after sustaining damage in a poor landing, and at Tondern L 24 crashed into the shed while landing: the resulting fire destroyed both L 24 and the adjacent L 17.\n1917.\nTo counter the increasingly effective defences, new Zeppelins were introduced, which had an increased operating altitude of and a ceiling of . The first of these S-class Zeppelins, LZ 91 (L 42) entered service in February 1917. They were basically a modification of the R-class, sacrificing strength and power for improved altitude. The surviving R-class Zeppelins were adapted by removing one of the engines. The improved safety was offset by the extra strain on the airship crews caused by altitude sickness and exposure to extreme cold and operating difficulties caused by cold and unpredictable high winds encountered at altitude.\nThe first raid of 1917 did not occur until 16\u201317 March: the five Zeppelins encountered very strong winds and none reached their targets. This experience was repeated on 23\u201324 May. Two days later, 21 Gotha bombers attempted a daylight raid on London. They were frustrated by heavy clouds, but the effort led the Kaiser to announce that airship raids on London were to stop; under pressure, he later relented to allow the Zeppelins to attack under \"favorable circumstances\".\nOn 16\u201317 June, another raid was attempted. Six Zeppelins were to take part, but two were kept in their shed by high winds, and another two were forced to return by engine failure. L 42 bombed Ramsgate, hitting a munitions store. The month-old L 48, the first U class Zeppelin, was forced to drop to where it was caught by four aircraft and destroyed, crashing near Theberton, Suffolk.\nAfter ineffective raids on the Midlands and the north of England on 21\u201322 August and 24\u201325 September, the last major Zeppelin raid of the war was launched on 19\u201320 October, with 13 airships heading for Sheffield, Manchester, and Liverpool. All were hindered by an unexpectedly strong headwind at altitude. L 45 was trying to reach Sheffield, but instead it dropped bombs on Northampton and London: most fell in the north-west suburbs but three bombs fell in Piccadilly, Camberwell and Hither Green, causing most of the casualties that night. L 45 then reduced altitude to try to escape the winds but was forced back into the higher air currents by a B.E.2e. The airship then had mechanical failure in three engines and was blown over France, eventually coming down near Sisteron; it was set on fire and the crew surrendered. L 44 was brought down by ground fire over France: L 49 and L 50 were also lost to engine failure and the weather over France. L 55 was badly damaged on landing and later scrapped.\nThere were no more raids in 1917, although the airships were not abandoned but refitted with new, more powerful engines.\n1918.\nThere were only four raids in 1918, all against targets in the Midlands and northern England. Five Zeppelins attempted to bomb the Midlands on 12\u201313 March to little effect. The following night, three Zeppelins set off, but two turned back because of the weather: the third bombed Hartlepool, killing eight and injuring 29. A five-Zeppelin raid on 12\u201313 April was also largely ineffective, with thick clouds making accurate navigation impossible. However, some alarm was caused by the other two, one of which reached the east coast and bombed Wigan, believing it was Sheffield: the other bombed Coventry in the belief that it was Birmingham. The final raid on 5 August 1918 involved four airships and resulted in the loss of \"L.70\" and the death of its entire crew under the command of \"Fregattenkapit\u00e4n\" Peter Strasser, head of the Imperial German Naval Airship Service and the \"F\u00fchrer der Luftschiffe\". Crossing the North Sea during daylight, the airship was intercepted by a Royal Air Force DH.4 biplane piloted by Major Egbert Cadbury, and shot down in flames.\nTechnological progress.\nZeppelin technology improved considerably as a result of the increasing demands of warfare. The company came under government control, and new personnel were recruited to cope with the increased demand, including the aerodynamicist Paul Jaray and the stress engineer Karl Arnstein. Many of these technological advances originated from Zeppelin's only serious competitor, the Mannheim-based Sch\u00fctte-Lanz company. While their dirigibles were never as successful, Professor Sch\u00fctte's more scientific approach to airship design led to important innovations, including the streamlined hull shape, the simpler cruciform fins (replacing the more complicated box-like arrangements of older Zeppelins), individual direct-drive engine cars, anti-aircraft machine-gun positions, and gas ventilation shafts which transferred vented hydrogen to the top of the airship. New production facilities were set up to assemble Zeppelins from components fabricated in Friedrichshafen.\nThe pre-war M-class designs were quickly enlarged to produce the long duralumin P-class, which increased gas capacity from , introduced a fully enclosed gondola, and had an extra engine. These modifications added to the maximum ceiling, around to the top speed, and greatly increased crew comfort and hence endurance. Twenty-two P-class airships were built; the first, LZ 38, was delivered to the Army on 3 April 1915. The P class was followed by a lengthened version, the Q class.\nIn July 1916 Luftschiffbau Zeppelin introduced the R-class, long, and with a volume of . These could carry loads of three to four tons of bombs and reach speeds of up to , powered by six Maybach engines.\nIn 1917, following losses to the air defences over Britain, new designs were produced which were capable of flying at much higher altitudes, typically operating at around . This was achieved by reducing the weight of the airship by reducing the weight of the structure, halving the bomb load, removing the defensive armament, and reducing the number of engines to five. However, these were not successful as bombers: the greater height at which they operated greatly hindered navigation, and their reduced power made them vulnerable to unfavorable weather conditions.\nAt the beginning of the war Captain Ernst A. Lehmann and Baron Gemmingen, Count Zeppelin's nephew, developed an observation car for use by dirigibles. While the zeppelin flew invisibly within or above the clouds, the car's observer would hang from a cable below the clouds, and relay navigation and bomb dropping orders. It was equipped with a wicker chair, chart table, electric lamp and compass, with telephone line and lightning conductor part of the suspension cable. Although used by Army airships, they were not used by the Navy, since Strasser considered that their weight meant an unacceptable reduction in bomb load.\nEnd of the war.\nThe German defeat also marked the end of German military dirigibles, as the victorious Allies demanded a complete abolition of German air forces and surrender of the remaining airships as reparations. Specifically, the Treaty of Versailles contained the following articles dealing explicitly with dirigibles:\n* \"Dirigibles able to take to the air, being manufactured, repaired or assembled.\"\n* \"Plant for the manufacture of hydrogen.\"\n* \"Dirigible sheds and shelters of every kind for aircraft.\"\n\"Pending their delivery, dirigibles will, at the expense of Germany, be maintained inflated with hydrogen; the plant for the manufacture of hydrogen, as well as the sheds for dirigibles, may at the discretion of the said Powers, be left to Germany until the time when the dirigibles are handed over.\"\nOn 23 June 1919, a week before the treaty was signed, many Zeppelin crews destroyed their airships in their hangars to prevent delivery, following the example of the scuttling of the German fleet at Scapa Flow two days earlier. The remaining dirigibles were transferred to France, Italy, Britain, and Belgium in 1920.\nA total of 84 Zeppelins were built during the war. Over 60 were lost, roughly evenly divided between accident and enemy action. 51 raids had been made on England alone, in which 5,806 bombs were dropped, killing 557 people and injuring 1,358 while causing damage estimated at \u00a31.5 million. It has been argued that the raids were effective far beyond material damage in diverting and hampering wartime production: one estimate is that due to the 1915\u201316 raids, \"one sixth of the total normal output of munitions was entirely lost.\"\nAfter World War I.\nRenaissance.\nCount von Zeppelin had died in 1917, before the end of the war. Hugo Eckener, who had long envisioned dirigibles as vessels of peace rather than of war, took command of the Zeppelin business, hoping to quickly resume civilian flights. Despite considerable difficulties, they completed two small passenger airships; LZ 120 \"Bodensee\" (scrapped in July 1928), which first flew in August 1919 and in the following months transported passengers between Friedrichshafen and Berlin, and a sister-ship \"LZ 121 Nordstern\", {Scrapped September 1926} which was intended for use on a regular route to Stockholm.\nHowever, in 1921, the Allied Powers demanded that these should be handed over as war reparations as compensation for the dirigibles destroyed by their crews in 1919. Germany was not allowed to construct military aircraft and only airships of less than were permitted. This brought a halt to Zeppelin's plans for airship development, and the company temporarily had to resort to manufacturing aluminium cooking utensils.\nEckener and his co-workers refused to give up and kept looking for investors and a way to circumvent Allied restrictions. Their opportunity came in 1924. The United States had started to experiment with rigid airships, constructing one of their own, the ZR-1 USS \"Shenandoah\", and buying the R38 (based on the Zeppelin L 70) when the British airship programme was cancelled. However, this broke apart and caught fire during a test flight above the Humber on 23 August 1921, killing 44 crewmen.\nUnder these circumstances, Eckener managed to obtain an order for the next American dirigible. Germany had to pay for this airship itself, as the cost was set against the war reparations accounts, but for the Zeppelin company, this was unimportant. LZ 126 made its first flight on 27 August 1924.\nOn 12 October at 07:30 local time, the Zeppelin took off for the US under the command of Hugo Eckener. The ship completed its voyage without any difficulties in 80 hours and 45 minutes. American crowds enthusiastically celebrated the arrival, and President Calvin Coolidge invited Eckener and his crew to the White House, calling the new Zeppelin an \"angel of peace\".\nGiven the designation ZR-3 USS \"Los Angeles\" and refilled with helium (partly sourced from the \"Shenandoah\") after its Atlantic crossing, the airship became the most successful American airship. It operated reliably for eight years until it was retired in 1932 for economic reasons. It was dismantled in August 1940.\nGolden age.\nWith the delivery of \"LZ 126\", the Zeppelin company had reasserted its lead in rigid airship construction, but it was not yet fully back in business. In 1926, restrictions on airship construction were relaxed, but acquiring the necessary funds for the next project proved a problem in the difficult economic situation of post\u2013World War I Germany, and it took Eckener two years of lobbying and publicity to secure the realization of \"LZ 127\".\nAnother two years passed before 18 September 1928, when the new dirigible, christened \"Graf Zeppelin\" in honour of the Count, flew for the first time. With a total length of and a volume of 105,000 m3, it was the largest dirigible to have been built at the time. Eckener's initial purpose was to use \"Graf Zeppelin\" for experimental and demonstration purposes to prepare the way for regular airship traveling, carrying passengers and mail to cover the costs.\nIn October 1928, its first long-range voyage brought it to Lakehurst. The voyage took 112 hours and set a new endurance record for airships. Eckener and his crew, which included his son Hans, were once more welcomed enthusiastically, with confetti parades in New York and another invitation to the White House. \"Graf Zeppelin\" toured Germany and visited Italy, Palestine, and \nSpain. A second trip to the United States was aborted in France due to engine failure in May 1929.\nIn August 1929, \"Graf Zeppelin\" departed for another daring enterprise: a circumnavigation of the globe. The growing popularity of the \"giant of the air\" made it easy for Eckener to find sponsors. One of these was the American press tycoon William Randolph Hearst, who requested that the tour officially start in Lakehurst. As with the October 1928 flight to New York, Hearst had placed a reporter, Grace Marguerite Hay Drummond-Hay, on board: she therefore became the first woman to circumnavigate the globe by air. From there, \"Graf Zeppelin\" flew to Friedrichshafen, then Tokyo, Los Angeles, and back to Lakehurst, in 21 days, 5 hours, and 31 minutes. Including the initial and final trips between Friedrichshafen and Lakehurst and back, the dirigible had travelled .\nIn the following year, \"Graf Zeppelin\" undertook trips around Europe, and following a successful tour to Recife, Brazil in May 1930, it was decided to open the first regular transatlantic airship line. This line operated between Frankfurt and Recife, and was later extended to Rio de Janeiro, with a stop in Recife. Despite the beginning of the Great Depression and growing competition from fixed-wing aircraft, \"LZ 127\" transported an increasing volume of passengers and mail across the ocean every year until 1936. The ship made another spectacular voyage in July 1931 when it made a seven-day research trip to the Arctic. This had already been a dream of Count von Zeppelin twenty years earlier, which could not be realized at the time due to the outbreak of war.\nEckener intended to follow the successful airship with another larger Zeppelin, designated LZ 128. This was to be powered by eight engines, in length, with a capacity of . However, the loss of the British passenger airship R101 on 5 October 1930 led the Zeppelin company to reconsider the safety of hydrogen-filled vessels, and the design was abandoned in favour of a new project, LZ 129. This was intended to be filled with inert helium.\n\"Hindenburg\", the end of an era.\nThe coming to power of the Nazi Party in 1933 had important consequences for Zeppelin Luftschiffbau. Zeppelins became a propaganda tool for the new regime: they would now display the Nazi swastika on their fins and occasionally tour Germany to play march music and propaganda speeches to the people. In 1934, Joseph Goebbels, the Minister of Propaganda, contributed two million Reichsmarks towards the construction of LZ 129.\nin 1935 Hermann G\u00f6ring established a new airline directed by Ernst Lehmann, the \"Deutsche Zeppelin Reederei\", as a subsidiary of \"Lufthansa\" to take over Zeppelin operations. Hugo Eckener, the father of the post-war Zeppelin renaissance, was an outspoken anti-Nazi: complaints about the use of Zeppelins for propaganda purposes in 1936 led Goebbels to declare \"Dr. Eckener has placed himself outside the pale of society. Henceforth his name is not to be mentioned in the newspapers and his photograph is not to be published\".\nOn 4 March 1936 LZ 129 \"Hindenburg\" (named after former President of Germany, Paul von Hindenburg) made its first flight. The \"Hindenburg\" was the largest airship ever built. It had been designed to use non-flammable helium, but the only supplies of the rare gas were controlled by the United States, which refused to allow its export. The fatal decision was made to fill the \"Hindenburg\" with flammable hydrogen. Apart from propaganda flights, \"LZ 129\" was used on the transatlantic service alongside \"Graf Zeppelin\".\nOn 6 May 1937, while landing in Lakehurst after a transatlantic flight, the tail of the ship caught fire, and within seconds, the \"Hindenburg\" burst into flames, killing 35 of the 97 people on board and one member of the ground crew. The cause of the fire was never definitively determined. The investigation into the accident concluded that static electricity had ignited hydrogen, which had leaked from the gasbags, although there were allegations of sabotage. 13 passengers and 22 crew, including Ernst Lehmann, were killed.\nDespite the obvious danger, there remained a list of 400 people who still wanted to fly as Zeppelin passengers and had paid for the trip. Their money was refunded in 1940.\n\"Graf Zeppelin\" was retired one month after the \"Hindenburg\" wreck and turned into a museum. A new intended flagship Zeppelin was completed in 1938 and, inflated with hydrogen, made some test flights (the first on 14 September), but never carried passengers. Another project, \"LZ 131\", designed to be even larger than \"Hindenburg\" and \"Graf Zeppelin II\", never progressed beyond the production of a few ring frames.\n\"Graf Zeppelin II\" was assigned to the \"Luftwaffe\" and made about 30 test flights before the beginning of World War II. Most of those flights were carried out near the Polish border, first in the Sudeten mountains region of Silesia, then in the Baltic Sea region. During one such flight \"LZ 130\" crossed the Polish border near the Hel Peninsula, where it was intercepted by a Polish Lublin R-XIII aircraft from Puck naval airbase and forced to leave Polish airspace. During this time, \"LZ 130\" was used for electronic scouting missions, and was equipped with various measuring equipment. In August 1939, it made a flight near the coastline of Great Britain in an attempt to determine whether the 100 metre towers erected from Portsmouth to Scapa Flow were used for aircraft radio location. \nPhotography, radio wave interception, and magnetic and radio frequency analysis were unable to detect operational British Chain Home radar due to searching in the wrong frequency range. The frequencies searched were too high, an assumption based on the Germans' own radar systems. The mistaken conclusion was that the British towers were not connected with radar operations, but were for naval radio communications.\nAfter the beginning of the Second World War on 1 September, the \"Luftwaffe\" ordered LZ 127 and \"LZ 130\" move to a large Zeppelin hangar in Frankfurt, where the skeleton of LZ 131 was also located. In March 1940, G\u00f6ring ordered the scrapping of the remaining airships, and on 6 May, the Frankfurt hangars were demolished.\nCultural influences.\nZeppelins have been an inspiration to music, cinematography, and literature. The 1930 movie \"Hell's Angels\", directed by Howard Hughes, features an unsuccessful Zeppelin raid on London during World War I. In 1934, the calypsonian Attila the Hun recorded \"Graf Zeppelin\", commemorating the airship's visit to Trinidad.\nZeppelins are often featured in alternate history and parallel universe fiction. They feature prominently in the popular fantasy novels of the \"His Dark Materials\" trilogy and \"The Book of Dust\" series by Philip Pullman. In the American science fiction series, \"Fringe\", Zeppelins are a notable historical idiosyncrasy that helps differentiate the series' two parallel universes, also used in \"Doctor Who\" in the episodes \"The Rise of the Cybermen\" and \"The Age of Steel\" when the TARDIS crashes in an alternate reality where Britain is a 'People's Republic' and Pete Tyler, Rose Tyler's father, is alive and is a wealthy inventor. \nThey are seen in the alternate reality 1939 plot line in the film \"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\", and have an iconic association with the steampunk subcultural movement in broader terms. In 1989, Japanese animator Miyazaki released \"Kiki's Delivery Service\", which features a Zeppelin as a plot element. A Zeppelin was used in \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\", when Jones and his father try to escape from Germany.\nIn 1968, English rock band Led Zeppelin chose their name after Keith Moon, drummer of The Who, told guitarist Jimmy Page that his idea to create a band would \"go down like a lead balloon.\" Page's manager Peter Grant suggested changing the spelling of \"Lead\" to \"Led\" to avoid mispronunciation. \"Balloon\" was replaced with \"Zeppelin\" as Jimmy Page saw it as a symbol of \"the perfect combination of heavy and light, combustibility and grace.\" For the group's self-titled debut album, Page suggested the group use a picture of the \"Hindenburg\" crashing in New Jersey in 1937, much to Countess Eva von Zeppelin's disgust. Von Zeppelin tried to sue the group for using her family name, but the case was eventually dismissed.\nModern era.\nSince the 1990s Luftschiffbau Zeppelin, a daughter enterprise of the Zeppelin conglomerate that built the original German Zeppelins, has been developing Zeppelin \"New Technology\" (NT) airships. These vessels are semi-rigid, based partly on internal pressure, partly on a frame.\nThe Airship Ventures company operated zeppelin passenger travel to California from October 2008 to November 2012 with one of these Zeppelin NT airships.\nIn May 2011, Goodyear announced that they would replace their fleet of blimps with Zeppelin NTs, resurrecting their partnership that ended over 70 years ago. Goodyear placed an order for three Zeppelin NTs, which then entered service between 2014 and 2018.\nIn October 2024, LTA Research performed the first test flight of Pathfinder 1, a fully rigid airship at Moffett Field in Mountain View, California.\nModern zeppelins are held aloft by the inert gas helium, eliminating the danger of combustion illustrated by the \"Hindenburg\".

In humans and most other anisogamous organisms, a zygote is formed when an egg cell and sperm cell come together to create a new unique organism.\nThe formation of a totipotent zygote with the potential to produce a whole organism depends on epigenetic reprogramming. DNA demethylation of the paternal genome in the zygote appears to be an important part of epigenetic reprogramming. In the paternal genome of the mouse, demethylation of DNA, particularly at sites of methylated cytosines, is likely a key process in establishing totipotency. Demethylation involves the processes of base excision repair and possibly other DNA-repair\u2013based mechanisms.\nHumans.\nIn human fertilization, a released ovum (a haploid secondary oocyte with replicate chromosome copies) and a haploid sperm cell (male gamete) combine to form a single diploid cell called the zygote. Once the single sperm fuses with the oocyte, the latter completes the division of the second meiosis forming a haploid daughter with only 23 chromosomes, almost all of the cytoplasm, and the male pronucleus. The other product of meiosis is the second polar body with only chromosomes but no ability to replicate or survive. In the fertilized daughter, DNA is then replicated in the two separate pronuclei derived from the sperm and ovum, making the zygote's chromosome number temporarily 4n diploid. After approximately 30 hours from the time of fertilization, a fusion of the pronuclei and immediate mitotic division produce two 2n diploid daughter cells called blastomeres.\nBetween the stages of fertilization and implantation, the developing embryo is sometimes termed as a preimplantation embryo. This stage has also been referred to as the pre-embryo in legal discourses including relevance to the use of embryonic stem cells. \nAfter fertilization, the conceptus travels down the fallopian tube towards the uterus while continuing to divide without actually increasing in size, in a process called cleavage. After four divisions, the conceptus consists of 16 blastomeres, and it is known as the morula. Through the processes of compaction, cell division, and blastulation, the conceptus takes the form of the blastocyst by the fifth day of development, just as it approaches the site of implantation. When the blastocyst hatches from the zona pellucida, it can implant in the endometrial lining of the uterus and begin the gastrulation stage of embryonic development.\nThe human zygote has been genetically edited in experiments designed to cure inherited diseases.\nFungi.\nIn fungi, this cell may then enter meiosis or mitosis depending on the life cycle of the species.\nPlants.\nIn plants, the zygote may be polyploid if fertilization occurs between meiotically unreduced gametes.\nIn land plants, the zygote is formed within a chamber called the archegonium. In seedless plants, the archegonium is usually flask-shaped, with a long hollow neck through which the sperm cell enters. As the zygote divides and grows, it does so inside the archegonium.\nIn single-celled organisms.\nThe zygote can divide asexually by mitosis to produce identical offspring.\nA \"Chlamydomonas\" zygote contains chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) from both parents; such cells are generally rare, since normally cpDNA is inherited uniparentally from the mt+ mating type parent. These rare biparental zygotes allowed mapping of chloroplast genes by recombination.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Unlike other polyhedral dice, it takes the appearance of a ball with 100 flattened spots. It is sometimes called \"Zocchi's Golfball\".\nZocchihedra are designed to provide percentage rolls in games, particularly in role-playing games. It is an alternative to the percentile die, which is used in conjunction with the d10 die.\nHistory.\nIt took three years for Zocchi to design his die, and three more years to get it into production. Since its introduction, Zocchi has improved the design of the Zocchihedron, filling it with teardrop-shaped free-falling weights to make it settle more swiftly when rolled.\nThe Zocchihedron II is a further improved model, and has another filler.\nProbability distribution of rolls.\nA test published in \"White Dwarf\" magazine concluded that the frequency distribution of the Zocchihedron was substantially uneven. Jason Mills noticed that some numbers were spaced closer together than others, and suspected that this non-uniform placement would cause some numbers to predictably come up more than others. Mills performed 5,164 rolls and the results confirmed these suspicions; some numbers came up significantly more than others. Most notably, rolls of more than 93 or less than 8 were significantly rarer than middling results. Not coincidentally, these numbers were all spaced closer together near the \"poles\" of the die, as opposed to numbers near the \"equator\" that are more widely spaced.\nAfter the test was published, the numbering on the Zocchihedron was redesigned with higher and lower numbers placed more evenly across all parts of the die. While numbers spaced closely together near the \"poles\" still come up less often, the numbers that are placed in these areas are more evenly distributed between 1 and 100, instead of consisting mainly of very high and very low numbers.\nPatents.\nThe aesthetic appearance of the Zocchihedron was protected by United States design patent D303,553, which expired on 19 September 2003. The original patent did not include mention of any internal braking mechanism. There was never a utility patent for the original Zocchihedron, although United States patent 6,926,276 may have protected the braking mechanism of the Zocchihedron II. That patent expired on 9 August 2025 and applied only to \"spherical dice\" containing \"multi sized and irregularly shaped particles\"."}

He wrote his works exclusively in Swedish, although they were translated early on into Finnish.\nGiven name.\nZacharias is his baptismal name, and this is used on the covers of his printed works. However, \"he himself most often used the abbreviation Z. or the form Zachris (), even in official contexts\", as explained in the \"National Biography of Finland\". Zachris is therefore the preferred form used in recent academic literature about him.\nThe Finnish form of Topelius' first name is Sakari(as) ().\nLife and career.\nEarly life.\nThe original name of the Topelius family was the Finnish name Toppila, which had been Latinized to Toppelius by the author's grandfather's grandfather and later changed to Topelius. Topelius was born at Kuddn\u00e4s, near Nykarleby in Ostrobothnia, the son of a physician of the same name (Zacharias Topelius the Elder), who was distinguished as the earliest collector of Finnish folk songs. His grandfather, Mikael Toppelius, was a painter noted for his murals and altarpieces in churches in Ostrobothnia.\nAs a child, he heard his mother, Katarina Sofia Calamnius, sing the songs of the Finnish-Swedish poet Frans Michael Franz\u00e9n. At the age of eleven, he was sent to school in Oulu and boarded with relatives in the possession of a lending library, where he nurtured his imagination with the reading of novels. He was given a Christian upbringing that came to characterize his entire life.\nStudy in Helsinki.\nHe came to Helsinki in 1831 and became a member of the circle of young nationalist men surrounding Johan Ludvig Runeberg, at whose home he stayed for some time. Topelius became a student at the Imperial Alexander University of Finland in 1833, received his master's degree (\"cand. philol.\") in 1840, the Licentiate degree in history in 1844 and his PhD in 1847, having defended a dissertation titled \"De modo matrimonia jungendi apud fennos quondam vigente\" (\"About the custom of marriage among the ancient Finns\"). Besides history, his academic studies had for periods been devoted both to Theology and Medicine. He was secretary of Societas pro Fauna et Flora Fennica 1842\u20131846, was employed by the university library 1846\u20131861, and taught History, Statistics and Swedish at the school Helsingfors lyceum during the same period.\nBecoming a professor.\nThrough the intervention of a friend, Fredrik Cygnaeus, Topelius was named professor extraordinary of the History of Finland at the university in 1854. He was made first ordinary professor of Finnish, Russian and Nordic history in 1863, and exchanged this chair for the one in general history in 1876. He was rector of the university from 1875 until 1878, when he retired as Emeritus Professor and received the title of \"verkligt statsr\u00e5d\" (Finnish: todellinen valtioneuvos, Russian: \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a; literally \"state councillor\", a Russian honorary title).\nFocus on writing.\nQuite early in his career he began to distinguish himself as a lyric poet, with the three successive volumes of his \"Heather Blossoms\" (1845\u201354). The earliest of his historical romances was \"The Duchess of Finland\", published in 1850. He was also editor-in-chief of the Helsingfors Tidningar from 1841 to 1860. In 1878, Topelius was allowed to withdraw from his professional duties, but this did not sever his connection with the university; it gave him, however, more leisure for his abundant and various literary enterprises. Of all the multifarious writings of Topelius, in prose and verse, that which has enjoyed the greatest popularity is his \"Tales of a Barber-Surgeon\", episodes of historical fiction from the days of Gustavus II Adolphus to those of Gustavus III, treated in the manner of Sir Walter Scott; the five volumes of this work appeared between 1853 and 1867. Topelius attempted to write drama, too, enjoying the most success with his tragedy \"Regina von Emmeritz\" (1854). Topelius aimed at the cultivation of a strong Finnish patriotism. He wrote a poem which Jean Sibelius used for a composition with a political statement, \"Islossningen i Ule\u00e5 \u00e4lv\".\nTogether with the composer Friedrich Pacius, he wrote the libretto (in the style of Romantic nationalism) to the first Finnish opera: \"Kaarle-kuninkaan mets\u00e4stys\" (Swedish: \"Kung Karls jakt\", English: \"King Charles' Hunt)\". Topelius initially thought of writing a trivial entertainment, but having heard extracts from the opera project at a concert in 1851, he realized that Pacius was writing a grand opera on the theme of salvation, following the early Romantic style of Carl Maria von Weber's \"Der Freisch\u00fctz\" (1821) and \"Oberon\" (1826). Topelius wrote the libretto in Swedish (though it was translated later by others), but its subject is emphatically Finnish. He also wrote the libretto for \"Prinsessan av Cypern\", set by Fredrik Pacius and Lars-Erik Larsson.\nDeath.\nTopelius died in his manor house in Koivuniemi, Sipoo, Finland, where he wrote his greatest works. He is buried in the Hietaniemi Cemetery in Helsinki.\nLegacy.\nAccording to tradition, the modern flag of Finland was based on a design by Topelius in about 1860.\nThere was a small Finnish American village named after Topelius, platted in 1901 in Otter Tail County, Minnesota, US.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She portrayed racial struggles in the early-20th-century American South and published research on Hoodoo and Caribbean Vodou. The most popular of her four novels is \"Their Eyes Were Watching God\", published in 1937. She also wrote more than 50 short stories, plays, an autobiography, ethnographies, and many essays. Some of her work, namely Tell My Horse (1937), explored ethnomusicological methods of study long before there were formal boundaries for the discipline, especially not boundaries that included the respectful study of communities of color. Hurston's unique background and exceptional approach to anthropology laid key foundations for the growth of ethnography, literature, and Africana Studies.\nHurston was born in Notasulga, Alabama, and moved with her family to Eatonville, Florida, in 1894. She later used Eatonville as the setting for many of her stories.\nIn her early career, Hurston conducted anthropological and ethnographic research as a scholar at Barnard College and Columbia University. She had an interest in African-American and Caribbean folklore, and how these contributed to the community's identity.\nShe also wrote about contemporary issues in the black community and became a central figure of the Harlem Renaissance. Her short satires, drawing from the African-American experience and racial division, were published in anthologies such as \"\" and \"Fire!!\" After moving back to Florida, Hurston wrote and published her literary anthology on African-American folklore in North Florida, \"Mules and Men\" (1935), and her first three novels: \"Jonah's Gourd Vine\" (1934); \"Their Eyes Were Watching God\" (1937); and \"Moses, Man of the Mountain\" (1939). Also published during this time was \"Tell My Horse: Voodoo and Life in Haiti and Jamaica\" (1938), documenting her research on rituals in Jamaica and Haiti.\nHurston's works concerned both the African-American experience and her struggles as an African-American woman. Her novels went relatively unrecognized by the literary world for decades. In 1975, fifteen years after Hurston's death, interest in her work was revived after author Alice Walker published an article, \"In Search of Zora Neale Hurston\" (later retitled \"Looking for Zora\"), in \"Ms.\" magazine.\nIn 2001, Hurston's manuscript \"Every Tongue Got to Confess\", a collection of folktales gathered in the 1920s, was published after being discovered in the Smithsonian archives. Her nonfiction book \"\" (2018), about the life of Cudjoe Lewis (Kossola), one of the last survivors of slaves brought illegally to the US in 1860, was also published posthumously.\nEarly life.\nZora Neale Hurston was born in 1891, the fifth of eight children of John Hurston and Lucy Ann Hurston (\"n\u00e9e\" Potts). All four of her grandparents had been born into slavery. Her father was a Baptist preacher and sharecropper, who later became a carpenter, and her mother was a school teacher. She was born in Notasulga, Alabama, on January 7, 1891. This was her father's hometown and her paternal grandfather was the preacher of a Baptist church.\nWhen she was three, her family moved to Eatonville, Florida. In 1887, it was one of the first all-black towns incorporated in the United States. Hurston said that Eatonville was \"home\" to her, as she was so young when she moved there. Sometimes she claimed it as her birthplace. A few years later in 1897, her father was elected as mayor of the town. In 1902 he was called to serve as minister of its largest church, Macedonia Missionary Baptist.\nIn 1901, some northern school teachers visited Eatonville and gave Hurston several books that opened her mind to literature. She later described this personal literary awakening as a kind of \"birth\".\nAs an adult, Hurston often used Eatonville as a setting in her stories\u2014it was a place where African Americans could live as they desired, independent of white society. Hurston grew up in Eatonville and described the experience in her 1928 essay, \"How It Feels To Be Colored Me\". Eatonville now holds an annual \"Zora! Festival\" in her honor.\nHurston's mother died in 1904. Her father married Mattie Moge in 1905. This was considered scandalous, as it was rumored that he had had sexual relations with Moge before his first wife's death. Hurston's father and stepmother sent her to a Baptist boarding school in Jacksonville, Florida, but she was dismissed after her parents stopped paying her tuition.\nPre-college.\nIn 1916, Hurston was employed as a maid by the lead singer of a touring Gilbert &amp; Sullivan theatrical company.\nIn 1917, she resumed her formal education by attending night school at Morgan Academy, now known as Morgan State University, a historically black college in Baltimore, Maryland. At this time, to qualify for a free high-school education, the 26-year-old Hurston began claiming 1901 as her year of birth. She graduated from the high school in 1918.\nCollege and graduate studies.\nIn college, Hurston learned how to view life through an anthropological lens apart from Eatonville. One of her main goals was to show similarities between ethnicities. In 1918, Hurston began her studies at Howard University, a historically black college in Washington, DC. She was a member of the Zeta Phi Beta sorority, founded by and for black women. She was also the first in her family to attend college, meaning that she was a first-generation college student. While at Howard, Hurston co-founded \"The Hilltop\", the university's student newspaper. She took courses in Spanish, English, Greek, and public speaking, and earned an associate degree in 1920. In 1921, she wrote a short story, \"John Redding Goes to Sea\", that qualified her to become a member of Alain Locke's literary club, The Stylus.\nBefore leaving Howard in 1924, Hurston helped publish the inaugural issue of the school newspaper. She also joined the Howard literary club, where she published her first two short stories. Despite this success, Hurston paid for school by working as a manicurist in the evenings\nIn 1925 Hurston was offered a scholarship by Barnard trustee Annie Nathan Meyer to Barnard College of Columbia University. She was the sole Black student in this women's college.\nHurston assisted Meyer in crafting the play \"Black Souls\"; which is considered one of the first \"lynching dramas\" written by a white woman. She conducted ethnographic research with anthropologist Franz Boas of Columbia University and later studied with him as a graduate student. She also worked with Ruth Benedict and fellow anthropology student Margaret Mead. Hurston received her B.A. in anthropology in 1928.\nAlain Locke recommended Hurston to Charlotte Osgood Mason, a philanthropist and literary patron who had supported Locke and other African-American authors, such as Langston Hughes; however, she also tried to direct their work. Mason became interested in Hurston's work and supported her travel in the South for research from 1927 to 1932 with a stipend of $200 per month. In return, she wanted Hurston to give her all the material she collected about Negro music, folklore, literature, hoodoo, and other forms of culture. Hurston's 1927-1932 travel in the South was also backed by the Association for the Study of Negro Life (now known as the Association for the Study of African American Life and History) and the American Folklore Society, which awarded her grants totaling $1,400.\nAt the same time, Hurston needed to satisfy Boas as her academic adviser. Boas was a cultural relativist who wanted to overturn ideas about ranking cultures in a hierarchy of values.\nAfter graduating from Barnard, Hurston spent two years as a graduate student in anthropology, working with Boas at Columbia University. Living in Harlem in the 1920s, Hurston befriended writers including Langston Hughes and Countee Cullen. Her apartment, according to some accounts, was a popular spot for social gatherings. Around this time, Hurston had a few literary successes, placing in short-story and playwriting contests in \"\", published by the National Urban League.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1927, Hurston married Herbert Sheen, a jazz musician and a former teacher at Howard. He later went to medical school and became a physician. Their marriage ended in 1931.\nIn 1935, Hurston was involved with Percy Punter, a graduate student at Columbia University. He inspired the character of Tea Cake in \"Their Eyes Were Watching God\".\nIn 1939, while Hurston was working for the WPA in Florida, she married Albert Price. They separated after a few months, but did not divorce until 1943.\nThe following year, Hurston married James Howell Pitts of Cleveland. That marriage, too, lasted less than a year.\nHurston twice lived in a cottage in Eau Gallie, Florida: in 1929 and again in 1951.\nPatronage and support.\nWhen foundation grants ended during the Great Depression, Hurston and her friend Langston Hughes both relied on the patronage of philanthropist Charlotte Osgood Mason, a white literary patron. During the 1930s, Hurston was a resident of Westfield, New Jersey, a suburb of New York, where her friend Hughes was among her neighbors.\nAcademic appointments.\nIn 1934, Hurston established a school of dramatic arts \"based on pure Negro expression\" at Bethune-Cookman College, a historically black college in Daytona Beach, Florida later to be known as Bethune-Cookman University. In 1956, Hurston received the Bethune-Cookman College Award for Education and Human Relations in recognition of her achievements. The English Department at Bethune-Cookman College remains dedicated to preserving her cultural legacy.\nFor the 1939\u20131940 academic year, Hurston joined the drama department at the North Carolina College for Negroes (NCC) in Durham. At the beginning of her tenure, Hurston published \"Moses, Man of the Mountain\".\nDuring her time in the Durham area, Hurston primarily participated in a variety of theater activities, marking her lasting interest in Black folkloric theater and drama. On October 7, 1939, Hurston addressed the Carolina Dramatic Association, remarking that \"our drama must be like us or it doesn't exist... I want to build the drama of North Carolina out of ourselves.\" She noted that her students were largely supportive of this endeavor because many of the plays performed and viewed by them previously were not relatable to their own experiences and instead prioritized a \"highbrow\" view of society.\nShe taught various courses at NCC, but she also studied informally at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Paul Green. She was also mentored by Frederick H. Koch, another faculty member at UNC and the founder of the Carolina Playmakers. She initially met both writers at the inaugural 1934 National Folk Festival in St. Louis, Missouri. She was persuaded by them to move to North Carolina for the prospect of collaboration with UNC faculty and students, despite the fact that UNC was still segregated and did not begin formally admitting Black students until 1951. Because her formal participation was limited, Hurston became a \"secret student\", participating in coursework and theater groups without enrolling at UNC. \"The Daily Tar Heel\", the UNC student newspaper, even named Hurston as a student in one such course, which focused on radio production.\nHurston left NCC after one year to pursue a new fieldwork project in South Carolina. It is likely that her departure was partially due to her poor relationship with NCC's president, James E. Shepard, to which she briefly alluded in her 1942 autobiography, \"Dust Tracks on a Road\". To Shepard, Hurston's attire and lifestyle choices were inappropriate for an unmarried woman, leading to many disagreements; her severance was rumored to be \"the only thing that [they] could apparently agree upon.\"\nIn 2015, UNC students called for Saunders Hall (named after former Ku Klux Klan leader William L. Saunders) to be renamed \"Hurston Hall\" in recognition of Hurston's contributions to academic life in the Durham-Chapel Hill area. UNC Trustees controversially voted to name the building Carolina Hall instead, but it is still known informally by many students as Hurston Hall. Despite the brief nature of her residency in North Carolina, Hurston is still honored at a variety of events in the area, including readings of her work. In 2024, Bree L. Davis received funding from the Southern Documentary Fund to produce a podcast documenting Hurston's experiences in the Durham-Chapel Hill area (forthcoming).\nAnthropological and folkloric fieldwork.\nHurston traveled extensively in the Caribbean and the American South and immersed herself in local cultural practices to conduct her anthropological research. Based on her work in the South, sponsored from 1928 to 1932 by Charlotte Osgood Mason, a wealthy philanthropist, Hurston wrote \"Mules and Men\" in 1935. She was researching lumber camps in north Florida and commented on the practice of white men in power taking black women as concubines, including having them bear children. This practice later was referred to as \"paramour rights\", based on the men's power under racial segregation and related to practices during slavery times. The book also includes much folklore. Hurston drew from this material as well in the fictional treatment she developed for her novels such as \"Jonah's Gourd Vine\" (1934).\nIn 1935, Hurston traveled to Georgia and Florida with Alan Lomax and Mary Elizabeth Barnicle for research on African-American song traditions and their relationship to slave and African antecedent music. She was tasked with selecting the geographic areas and contacting the research subjects.\nIn 1936 and 1937, Hurston traveled to Jamaica and Haiti for research, with support from the Guggenheim Foundation. She drew from this research for \"Tell My Horse\" (1938), a genre-defying book that mixes anthropology, folklore, and personal narrative. In the fourth chapter of this book, titled \"Night Song After Death\", Hurston recounts the time she visited St. Thomas, Jamaica, where she observed and participated in the ritual of the \"Nine Night\". This chapter illustrates how Hurston's method of fieldwork was not overly analytical or quantitative, as she primarily aimed at capturing the experiences and perspectives of the Jamaican people, while also encapsulating the atmosphere and spiritual fervor that surrounded the ritual. Although Hurston's more qualitative work lacks the technicalities used in quantitative ethnographic work, such as a thorough analysis describing the form or tonalities of the music played during the \"Nine Night\", it provides advantages that quantitative research cannot cover: Hurston's qualitative ethnographic fieldwork has the ability to convey how the social interactions (e.g., through dance), stories and beliefs/superstitions (e.g., the ever-changing stories interviewees told her, concerning the \"duppy\" or spirit), and the culture's use of music, are used celebrate the life and afterlife of the recently deceased.\nIn 1938 and 1939, Hurston worked for the Federal Writers\u2019 Project (FWP), part of the Works Progress Administration. Hired for her experience as a writer and folklorist, she gathered information to add to Florida's historical and cultural collection. Music makes up a significant portion of the material she collected for the FWP, including: \u201cCrow Dance,\u201d a Bahamian-American dance song with West African roots; the Gullah Geechee song, \u201cOh, the Buford Boat Done Come\u201d; and the folk song \u201cJohn Henry,\u201d performed by Gabriel Brown.\nFrom May 1947 to February 1948, Hurston lived in Honduras, in the north coastal town of Puerto Cort\u00e9s. She had some hopes of locating either Mayan ruins or vestiges of an undiscovered civilization. While in Puerto Cort\u00e9s, she wrote much of \"Seraph on the Suwanee\", set in Florida. Hurston expressed interest in the polyethnic nature of the population in the region (many, such as the Miskito Zambu and Garifuna, were of mixed African and indigenous ancestry and had developed creole cultures).\nDuring her last decade, Hurston worked as a freelance writer for magazines and newspapers. In the fall of 1952, she was contacted by Sam Nunn, editor of the \"Pittsburgh Courier,\" to go to Florida to cover the murder trial of Ruby McCollum. McCollum was charged with murdering the white Dr. C. Leroy Adams, who was also a state politician. McCollum said he had forced her to have sex and bear his child. Hurston recalled what she had seen of white male sexual dominance in the lumber camps in North Florida, and discussed it with Nunn. They both thought the case might be about such \"paramour rights\", and wanted to \"expose it to a national audience\".\nUpon reaching Live Oak, Hurston was surprised not only by the gag order the judge in the trial placed on the defense but by her inability to get residents in town to talk about the case; both blacks and whites were silent. She believed that might have been related to Dr. Adams' alleged involvement in the gambling operation of Ruby's husband Sam McCollum. Her articles were published by the newspaper during the trial. Ruby McCollum was convicted by an all-male, all-white jury, and sentenced to death. Hurston had a special assignment to write a serialized account, \"The Life Story of Ruby McCollum\", over three months in 1953 in the newspaper. Her part was ended abruptly when she and Nunn disagreed about her pay, and she left.\nUnable to pay independently to return for the appeal and second trial, Hurston contacted journalist William Bradford Huie, with whom she had worked at \"The American Mercury\", to try to interest him in the case. He covered the appeal and second trial, and also developed material from a background investigation. Hurston shared her material with him from the first trial, but he acknowledged her only briefly in his book, \"Ruby McCollum: Woman in the Suwannee Jail\" (1956), which became a bestseller.\nHurston celebrated that\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"McCollum's testimony in her own defense marked the first time that a woman of African-American descent was allowed to testify as to the paternity of her child by a white man. Hurston firmly believed that Ruby McCollum's testimony sounded the death toll of 'paramour rights' in the Segregationist South.\"\nAmong other positions, Hurston later worked at the Pan American World Airways Technical Library at Patrick Air Force Base in 1956. She was fired in 1957 for being \"too well-educated\" for her job.\nShe moved to Fort Pierce, Florida. Taking jobs where she could find them, Hurston worked occasionally as a substitute teacher. At age 60, Hurston had to fight \"to make ends meet\" with the help of public assistance. At one point she worked as a maid on Miami Beach's Rivo Alto Island.\nDeath and legacy.\nDuring a period of financial and medical difficulties, Hurston was forced to enter St. Lucie County Welfare Home, where she had a stroke. She died of hypertensive heart disease on January 28, 1960, and was buried at the Garden of Heavenly Rest in Fort Pierce, Florida. Her remains were in an unmarked grave until 1973.\nNovelist Alice Walker and fellow Hurston scholar Charlotte D. Hunt found an unmarked grave in 1973 in the general area where Hurston had been buried; they decided to mark it as hers. Walker commissioned a gray marker inscribed with \"ZORA NEALE HURSTON / \"A GENIUS OF THE SOUTH\" / NOVELIST FOLKLORIST / ANTHROPOLOGIST / 1901\u20131960.\" The line \"a genius of the south\" is from Jean Toomer's poem, \"Georgia Dusk\", which appears in his book \"Cane\". Hurston was born in 1891, not 1901.\nAfter Hurston's death, a yardman, who had been told to clean the house, was burning Hurston's papers and belongings. A law officer and friend, Patrick DuVal, passing by the house where she had lived, stopped and put out the fire, thus saving an invaluable collection of literary documents. For two years, he stored them on his covered porch until he and a group of Hurston's friends could find an archive to take the material. The nucleus of this collection was given to the University of Florida libraries in 1961 by Mrs. Marjorie Silver, a friend, and neighbor of Hurston. Within the collection is a manuscript and photograph of Seraph on the Suwanee and an unpublished biography of Herod the Great. Luckily, she donated some of her manuscripts to the James Weldon Johnson Collection of Yale University. Other materials were donated in 1970 and 1971 by Frances Grover, daughter of E. O. Grover, a Rollins College professor and long-time friend of Hurston. In 1979, Stetson Kennedy of Jacksonville, who knew Hurston through his work with the Federal Writers' Project, added additional papers. (Zora Neale Hurston Papers, University of Florida Smathers Libraries, August 2008).\nIn 2017, comic creator Peter Bagge published a graphic novel based on her life and works called \"Fire!!: the Zora Neale Hurston Story\". It was reviewed positively by NPR and other media outlets.\nLiterary career.\nWhen Hurston arrived in New York City in 1925, the Harlem Renaissance was at its zenith, and she soon became one of the writers at its center. Shortly before she entered Barnard, Hurston's short story \"Spunk\" was selected for \"The New Negro\", a landmark anthology of fiction, poetry, and essays focusing on African and African-American art and literature. In 1926, a group of young black writers including Hurston, Langston Hughes, and Wallace Thurman, calling themselves the Niggerati, produced a literary magazine called \"Fire!!\" that featured many of the young artists and writers of the Harlem Renaissance.\nIn 1927, Hurston traveled to the Deep South to collect African-American folk tales. She also interviewed Cudjoe Kazzola Lewis, of Africatown, Alabama, who was the last known survivor of the enslaved Africans carried aboard \"Clotilda\", an illegal slave ship that had entered the US in 1860, and thus the last known person to have been transported in the Transatlantic slave trade. The next year she published the article \"Cudjoe's Own Story of the Last African Slaver\" (1928). According to her biographer Robert E. Hemenway, this piece largely plagiarized the work of Emma Langdon Roche, an Alabama writer who wrote about Lewis in a 1914 book. Hurston did add new information about daily life in Lewis' home village of Bant\u00e8.\nHurston intended to publish a collection of several hundred folk tales from her field studies in the South. She wanted to have them be as close to the original as possible but struggled to balance the expectations of her academic adviser, Franz Boas, and her patron, Charlotte Osgood Mason. This manuscript was not published at the time. A copy was later found at the Smithsonian archives among the papers of anthropologist William Duncan Strong, a friend of Boas. Hurston's \"Negro Folk-tales from the Gulf States\" was published posthumously in 2001 as \"Every Tongue Got to Confess.\"\nIn 1928, Hurston returned to Alabama with additional resources; she conducted more interviews with Lewis, took photographs of him and others in the community, and recorded the only known film footage of him\u2014an African who had been trafficked to the United States through the slave trade. Based on this material, she wrote a manuscript, \"\", completing it in 1931. Hemenway described it as \"a highly dramatic, semifictionalized narrative intended for the popular reader.\" It has also been described as a \"testimonial text\", more in the style of other anthropological studies since the late 20th century.\nAfter this round of interviews, Hurston's literary patron, philanthropist Charlotte Osgood Mason, learned of Lewis and began to send him money for his support. Lewis was also interviewed by journalists for local and national publications. Hurston's manuscript \"Barracoon\" was eventually published posthumously on May 8, 2018. \"Barracoon\", or barracks in Spanish, is where captured Africans were temporarily imprisoned before being shipped abroad.\nIn 1929, Hurston moved to Eau Gallie, Florida, where she wrote \"Mules and Men.\" It was published in 1935.\n1930s.\nBy the mid-1930s, Hurston had published several short stories and the critically acclaimed \"Mules and Men\" (1935), a groundbreaking work of \"literary anthropology\" documenting African-American folklore from timber camps in North Florida. To her collection of folktales, she added the quip \"Now you are going to hear lies above suspicion\". In 1930, she collaborated with Langston Hughes on \"Mule Bone: A Comedy of Negro Life\", a play that they never staged. Their collaboration caused their friendship to fall apart. The play was first staged in 1991.\nHurston adapted her anthropological work for the performing arts. Her folk revue \"The Great Day\" featured authentic African song and dance, and premiered at the John Golden Theatre in New York in January 1932. Despite positive reviews, it had only one performance. The Broadway debut left Hurston in $600 worth of debt. No producers wanted to move forward with a full run of the show.\nDuring the 1930s, Zora Neale Hurston produced two more musical revues, \"From Sun to Sun,\" which was a revised adaptation of \"The Great Day,\" and \"Singing Steel.\" Hurston had a strong belief that folklore should be dramatized.\nHurston's first three novels were published in the 1930s: \"Jonah's Gourd Vine\" (1934); \"Their Eyes Were Watching God\" (1937), written during her fieldwork in Haiti and considered her masterwork; and \"Moses, Man of the Mountain\" (1939).\nIn 1937, Hurston was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship to conduct ethnographic research in Jamaica and Haiti. \"Tell My Horse\" (1938) documents her account of her fieldwork studying spiritual and cultural rituals in Jamaica and vodoun in Haiti.\n1940s and 1950s.\nIn the 1940s, Hurston's work was published in such periodicals as \"The American Mercury\" and \"The Saturday Evening Post\". Her last published novel, \"Seraph on the Suwanee\", notable principally for its focus on white characters, was published in 1948. It explores images of \"white trash\" women. Jackson (2000) argues that Hurston's meditation on abjection, waste, and the construction of class and gender identities among poor whites reflects the eugenics discourses of the 1920s.\nIn 1952, Hurston was assigned by the \"Pittsburgh Courier\" to cover the small-town murder trial of Ruby McCollum, the prosperous black wife of the local bolita racketeer, who had killed a racist white doctor. She also contributed to \"Ruby McCollum: Woman in the Suwannee Jail\" (1956), a book by journalist and civil rights advocate William Bradford Huie.\nPosthumous publications.\nHurston's manuscript \"Every Tongue Got to Confess\" (2001), a collection of folktales gathered in the 1920s, was published posthumously after being discovered in Smithsonian archives.\nIn 2008, The Library of America selected excerpts from \"Ruby McCollum: Woman in the Suwannee Jail\" (1956), to which Hurston had contributed, for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of American true crime writing.\nHurston's nonfiction book \"\" was published in 2018. A barracoon is a type of barracks where slaves were imprisoned before being taken overseas.\nIn February 2022, a collection of Hurston's non-fiction writings titled \"You Don't Know Us Negroes and Other Essays\", edited by Henry Louis Gates Jr, and Genevieve West, was published by HarperCollins.\nOn January 7, 2025, to coincide with Hurston's birthday, her unfinished novel \"The Life of Herod the Great\" was published by HarperCollins.\nSpiritual views.\nIn Chapter XV of \"Dust Tracks on a Road\", entitled \"Religion\", Hurston expressed disbelief in and disdain for both theism and religious belief. She states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Prayer seems to me a cry of weakness, and an attempt to avoid, by trickery, the rules of the game as laid down. I do not choose to admit weakness. I accept the challenge of responsibility. Life, as it is, does not frighten me, since I have made my peace with the universe as I find it, and bow to its laws.\nHowever, although she firmly rejected the Baptist beliefs of her preacher father, she retained an interest in religion from anthropological and literary standpoints. She investigated voodoo, going so far as to participate in rituals alongside her research subjects. In another of her original uncensored notes for her autobiography shares her admiration for Biblical characters like King David: \"He was a man after God's own heart, and was quite serviceable in helping God get rid of no-count rascals who were cluttering up the place.\"\nPublic obscurity.\nHurston's work slid into obscurity for decades, for both cultural and political reasons. The use of African-American dialect, as featured in Hurston's novels, became less popular. Younger writers felt that it was demeaning to use such dialect, given the racially charged history of dialect fiction in American literature. Also, Hurston had made stylistic choices in dialogue influenced by her academic studies. Thinking like a folklorist, Hurston strove to represent speech patterns of the period, which she had documented through ethnographic research.\nSeveral of Hurston's literary contemporaries criticized her use of dialect, saying that it was a caricature of African-American culture and was rooted in a post-Civil War, white racist tradition. These writers, associated with the Harlem Renaissance, criticized Hurston's later work as not advancing the movement. Richard Wright, in his review of \"Their Eyes Were Watching God,\" said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The sensory sweep of her novel carries no theme, no message, no thought. In the main, her novel is not addressed to the Negro, but to a white audience whose chauvinistic tastes she knows how to satisfy. She exploits that phase of Negro life which is \"quaint,\" the phase which evokes a piteous smile on the lips of the \"superior\" race.\nBut since the late 20th century, there has been a revival of interest in Hurston. Critics have since praised her skillful use of idiomatic speech.\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, when her work was published, the pre-eminent African-American author was Richard Wright, a former Communist. Unlike Hurston, Wright wrote in explicitly political terms. He had become disenchanted with Communism, but he used the struggle of African Americans for respect and economic advancement as both the setting and the motivation for his work. Other popular African-American authors of the time, such as Ralph Ellison, dealt with the same concerns as Wright albeit in ways more influenced by Modernism.\nHurston, who at times evinced conservative attitudes, was on the other side of the disputes over the promise of leftist politics for African Americans. In 1951, for example, Hurston argued that New Deal economic support had created a harmful dependency by African Americans on the government and that this dependency ceded too much power to politicians.\nDespite increasing difficulties, Hurston maintained her independence and a determined optimism. She wrote in a 1957 letter:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;But ... I have made phenomenal growth as a creative artist. ... I am not materialistic ... If I do happen to die without money, somebody will bury me, though I do not wish it to be that way.\nPolitical views.\nHurston was a Republican who aligned herself with the politics of the Old Right and she was also a supporter of Booker T. Washington. Although she once stated her support for the \"complete repeal of All Jim Crow Laws\", she was a contrarian on civil rights activism and she generally lacked interest in being associated with it. In 1951, she criticized the New Deal by arguing that it had created a harmful dependency on the government among African Americans and she also argued that this dependency ceded too much power to politicians. She criticized communism in her 1951 essay titled \"Why the Negro won't Buy Communism\" and she also accused communists of exploiting African Americans for their own personal gain. In her 1938 review of Richard Wright's short-story collection \"Uncle Tom's Children\", she criticized his communist beliefs and the Communist Party USA for supporting \"state responsibility for everything and individual responsibility for nothing, not even feeding one's self\". Her views on communism, the New Deal, civil rights, and other topics contrasted with the views of many of her colleagues during the Harlem Renaissance, such as Langston Hughes, who was a supporter of the Soviet Union and praised it in several of his poems during the 1930s.\nJohn McWhorter has called Hurston a conservative, stating that she is \"America's favorite black conservative\". David T. Beito and Linda Royster Beito have argued that she can be characterized as a libertarian, comparing her to Rose Wilder Lane and Isabel Paterson, two female libertarian novelists who were her contemporaries and are known as the \"founding mothers\" of American libertarianism.\nRussell A. Berman of the Hoover Institution described her as a \"heterodox and staunchly libertarian thinker\".\nThe libertarian magazine \"Reason\" praised her, claiming: \"What Hurston wanted, in both life and literature, was for everyone, of every race, for better or worse, to be viewed as an individual first.\"\nIn response to black writers who criticized her novel \"Their Eyes Were Watching God\" because it did not explore racial themes, she stated: \"I am not interested in the race problem, but I am interested in the problems of individuals, white ones and black ones\". She criticized what she described as \"Race Pride and Race Consciousness\", describing it as a \"thing to be abhorred\", stating:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAlthough her personal quotes show disbelief of religion, Hurston did not negate spiritual matters as evidenced from her 1942 autobiography \"Dust Tracks on a Road\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn 1952, Hurston supported the presidential campaign of Senator Robert A. Taft. Like Taft, Hurston was against Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal policies. She also shared his opposition to Roosevelt and Truman's interventionist foreign policy. In the original draft of her autobiography, \"Dust Tracks on a Road\", Hurston compared the United States government to a \"fence\" in stolen goods and a Mafia-like protection racket. Hurston thought it ironic that the same \"people who claim that it is a noble thing to die for freedom and democracy... wax frothy if anyone points out the inconsistency of their morals... We, too, consider machine gun bullets good laxatives for heathens who get constipated with toxic ideas about a country of their own.\" She was scathing about those who sought \"freedoms\" for those abroad but denied it to people in their home countries: Roosevelt \"can call names across an ocean\" for his Four Freedoms, but he did not have \"the courage to speak even softly at home.\" When Truman dropped the atomic bombs on Japan she called him \"the Butcher of Asia\".\nHurston opposed the Supreme Court ruling in the \"Brown v. Board of Education\" case of 1954. She felt that if separate schools were truly equal (and she believed that they were rapidly becoming so), educating black students in physical proximity to white students would not result in better education. Also, she worried about the demise of black schools and black teachers as a way to pass on the cultural tradition to future generations of African Americans. She voiced this opposition in a letter, \"Court Order Can't Make the Races Mix\", that was published in the \"Orlando Sentinel\" in August 1955. Hurston had not reversed her long-time opposition to integration. Rather, she feared that the Court's ruling could become a precedent for an all-powerful federal government to undermine individual liberty on a broad range of issues in the future. Hurston also opposed preferential treatment for African Americans, saying:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCriticism.\nIntegration.\nHurston appeared to oppose integration based on pride and her sense of independence. She would not \"bow low before the white man\", and claimed \"adequate Negro schools\" already existed in 1955. Hurston is described as a \"trailblazer for black women's empowerment\" because of her numerous individual achievements and her strong belief that black women could be \"self-made\". However, a common criticism of her work is that the vagueness of her racial politics in her writing, particularly about black feminism, makes her \"a prime candidate for white intellectual idolatry.\" Darwin T. Turner, an English professor and specialist in African-American literature, faulted Hurston in 1971 for opposing integration and for opposing programs to guarantee blacks the right to work.\nResearch and representation.\nSome authors criticized Hurston for her sensationalist representation of voodoo. In \"The Crisis\" magazine in 1943, Harold Preece criticized Hurston for her perpetuation of \"Negro primitivism\" in order to advance her own literary career. The \"Journal of Negro History\" complained that her work on voodoo was an indictment of African-American ignorance and superstition.\nJeffrey Anderson states that Hurston's research methods were questionable and that she fabricated material for her works on voodoo. He observed that she admitted to inventing dialogue for her book \"Mules and Men\" in a letter to Ruth Benedict and described fabricating the \"Mules and Men\" story of rival voodoo doctors as a child in her later autobiography. Anderson believes that many of Hurston's other claims in her voodoo writings are dubious as well.\nSeveral authors have contended that Hurston engaged in significant plagiarism, and her biographer Robert Hemenway argues that the article \"Cudjo's Own Story of the Last African Slaver\" (1927) was approximately 25% original, the rest being plagiarized from Emma Langdon Roche's \"Historic Sketches of the Old South\". Hemenway does not claim that this undermines the validity of her later fieldwork: he states that Hurston \"never plagiarized again; she became a major folklore collector\".\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "34454", "revid": "196446", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34454", "title": "Zosimus (historian)", "text": "Late 5th/early 6th century Byzantine historian\nZosimus ( ; fl. 490s\u2013510s) was a Greek historian who lived in Constantinople during the reign of the eastern Roman Emperor Anastasius I (491\u2013518). According to Photius, he was a \"comes\", and held the office of \"advocate\" of the imperial treasury. Zosimus was also known for condemning Constantine\u2019s rejection of the traditional polytheistic religion.\nLittle more is known about the life of Zosimus except that he was Greek and a pagan. He was not a contemporary of the events of his books.\n\"Historia Nova\".\nZosimus' \"Historia Nova\" (\u1f39\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \u039d\u03ad\u03b1, \"New History\") is written in Greek in six books and covers the period from 238 to 410 A.D. It was written at the end of the fifth century. For the period from 238 to 270, he apparently uses Dexippus; for the period from 270 to 404, Eunapius; and after 407, Olympiodorus. His dependence on his sources is made clear by the change in tone and style between the Eunapian and Olympiodoran sections, and by the gap left in between them. In the Eunapian section, for example, he is pessimistic and critical of Stilicho; in the Olympiodoran section, he offers precise figures and transliterations from the Latin, and favors Stilicho.\nThe first book sketches briefly the history of the early Roman emperors from Augustus to Diocletian (305); the second, third and fourth deal more fully with the period from the accession of Constantius Chlorus and Galerius to the death of Theodosius I; the fifth and sixth cover the period between 395 and 410, when Priscus Attalus was deposed; for this period, he is the most important surviving non-ecclesiastical source. The work, which breaks off abruptly in the summer of 410 at the beginning of the sixth book, is believed to have been written in 498\u2013518.\nThe style is characterized by Photius as concise, clear and pure. The historian's object was to account for the decline of the Roman Empire from a pagan point of view. Zosimus is the only surviving non-Christian source for much of what he reports.\nIn contrast to Polybius, who had narrated the rise of the Roman Empire, Zosimus documented the events and causes which led to its decline. Though the decline of the Roman Empire was Zosimus' primary subject, he also discussed events connected with Persian and Greek history, perhaps in imitation of Polybius. It is clear that Photius and Evagrius did not have any more of Zosimus' work than what survives today. Yet it is likely that either a part of the work has been lost or, more likely, that Zosimus did not live to finish it; for it does not cover all the areas that Zosimus himself tells us he intended to discuss. There does not seem to be much probability in the conjecture that the monks and other ecclesiastics succeeded in suppressing that portion of the work in which the evil influences of their bodies were to be more especially touched upon. If the work was thus left incomplete, that circumstance would account for some carelessness of style which is here and there apparent. There may appear some difficulty at first sight, however, in the statement of Photius, that the work, in the form in which he saw it, appeared to him to be a second edition. But it would seem that Photius was under some misapprehension. It is called in the manuscripts \"Historia Nova\" (in what sense is not quite clear). This may perhaps have misled Photius. He himself remarks that he had not seen the first edition.\nZosimus was a pagan, and is by no means sparing of the faults and crimes of the Christian emperors. In consequence of this his credibility has been fiercely assailed by several Christian writers. The question does not, as has sometimes been supposed, turn upon the credibility of the historians whom Zosimus followed, for he did not adhere in all cases to their judgment with respect to events and characters. For instance, although Zosimus followed Eunapius for the period 270\u2013404, he entirely differed from Eunapius in his account of Stilicho and Serena. Of post-medieval writers, Caesar Baronius, Lelio Bisciola, Kaspar von Barth, Johann Daniel Ritter, Richard Bentley, and G. E. M. de Ste. Croix, have taken the derogatory side. Bentley in particular speaks of Zosimus with great contempt. On the other hand, his historical authority has been maintained by Leunclavius, G. B. von Schirach, J. Matth. Schrockh, and Reitemeier. Due to pagan leanings, Zosimos is said to have lost his \"advocatus fisci\" position in the imperial treasury, explaining his bitterness in his accounts.\nEditions.\nThe history of Zosimus was first printed in the Latin translation of Leunclavius, accompanied by a defence of the historian (Basel, 1576, fol.). The first two books, in Greek, with the translation of Leunclavius, were printed by H. Stephanus, in his edition of Herodian (Paris, 1581). The first complete edition of the Greek text of Zosimus was that by F. Sylburg (\"Scriptores Hist. Rom. Min.\", vol. iii., Frankfurt, 1590). Later editions are those published at Oxford (1679), at Zeitz and Jena, edited by Cellarius, with annotations of his own and others (1679, 1713, 1729). The next edition is that by Reitemeier, who, though he consulted no fresh manuscripts, made good use of the critical remarks of Heyne and other scholars (Leipzig, 1784). Bekker produced a reliable edition in 1837 at Bonn. There is a German translation by Seybold and Heyler, and also an English and a French translation. (Sch\u00f6ll, Gesch. d. Griech. Lit. vol. iii, p.\u00a0232; Fabric. Bibl. Graec. vol. viii. p.\u00a062.)\nThe single good manuscript, in the Vatican Library (MS Vat. Gr. 156), was unavailable to scholars until the mid-19th century, although it lacks the conclusion of the first book and the beginning of the second. Ludwig Mendelssohn (Leipzig 1887) edited the first dependable text. The modern standard edition is F. Paschoud \"Zosime: Histoire Nouvelle\" (Paris 1971) which has a French translation, introduction and commentary. A later edition in English, \"Zosimus: New History\" a translation with commentary by Ronald T. Ridley, was published in 1982 by the Australian Association of Byzantine Studies.\nReception.\nZosimus\u2019 work contains multiple errors, some of them not found in any other extant source, such as wrongly reporting that all three of Constantine\u2019s successors were not the sons of his wife Fausta. Edward Gibbon judged him as \u201cunworthy of esteem and trust,\u201d \u201cpoor in judgment,\u201d and \u201ca disingenuous liar.\u201d Ludwig Mendelssohn observed that, \u201cThe more familiar one becomes with Zosimus, the more one learns to distrust him.\u201d\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "34455", "revid": "53396", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34455", "title": "Zakat", "text": "Form of almsgiving obligatory in Islam\nZakat (or Zak\u0101h) is one of the Five Pillars of Islam. \"Zakat\" is the Arabic word for \"giving to charity\" or \"giving to the needy\". Zakat is a form of almsgiving, often collected by the Muslim Ummah. It is considered in Islam a religious obligation, and by Quranic ranking, is next after prayer (\"salat\") in importance. Eight heads of zakat are mentioned in the Quran.\nAs one of the Five Pillars of Islam, zakat is a religious duty for all Muslims who meet the necessary criteria of wealth to help the needy. It is a mandatory charitable contribution, often considered to be a tax. The payment and disputes on zakat have played a major role in the history of Islam, notably during the Ridda wars.\nZakat on wealth is based on the value of all of one's possessions. It is customarily 2.5% (or &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u204440) of a Muslim's total savings and wealth above a minimum amount known as \"nisab\" each lunar year, but Islamic scholars differ on how much \"nisab\" is and other aspects of zakat. According to Islamic doctrine, the collected amount should be paid to the poor and the needy, Zakat collectors, orphans, widows, those to be freed from slavery, the aged who cannot work to feed themselves, those in debt, \"in the cause of God\" and to benefit the stranded traveller.\nToday, in most Muslim-majority countries, zakat contributions are voluntary, while in Libya, Malaysia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Yemen, zakat is mandated and collected by the state (as of 2015).\nShias, unlike Sunnis, have traditionally regarded zakat as a private action, and they give zakat to imam-sponsored rather than state-sponsored collectors, but it is also obligatory for them.\nEtymology.\nThe word Zakat comes from Arabic root z-k-w (\u0632 \u0643 \u0648), meaning to purify. Zakat is considered a way to purify one's income and wealth from sometimes worldly, impure ways of acquisition. According to Sachiko Murata and William Chittick, \"Just as ablutions purify the body and salat purifies the soul (in Islam), so zakat purifies possessions and makes them pleasing to God.\"\nDoctrine.\nQuran.\nThe Quran discusses charity in many verses, some of which relate to zakat. The word zakat, with the meaning used in Islam now, is found, for example, in suras: 7:156, 9:60, 19:31, 19:55, 21:73, 23:4, 27:3, 30:39, 31:4, and 41:7.\nZakat is found in the early Medinan suras and described as obligatory for Muslims. It is given for the sake of salvation. Muslims believe those who give zakat can expect reward from God in the afterlife, while neglecting to give zakat can result in damnation. Zakat is considered part of the covenant between God and a Muslim.\nVerse 2:177 (the Clear Qur'an translation) sums up the Quranic view of charity and almsgiving (another name for zakat is the \"poor due\"):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Righteousness is not in turning your faces towards the east or the west. Rather, the righteous are those who believe in Allah, the Last Day, the angels, the Books, and the prophets; who give charity out of their cherished wealth to relatives, orphans, the poor, \u02f9needy\u02fa travellers, beggars, and for freeing captives; who establish prayer, pay alms-tax, and keep the pledges they make; and who are patient in times of suffering, adversity, and in \u02f9the heat of\u02fa battle. It is they who are true \u02f9in faith\u02fa, and it is they who are mindful \u02f9of Allah\u02fa. \u2013 2:177\nAccording to Yusuf al-Qaradawi, verse 9.5 of the Quran makes zakat one of three prerequisites for pagans to become Muslims: \"but if they repent, establish prayers, and practice zakat they are your brethren in faith\".\nThe Quran also lists who should receive the benefits of zakat, discussed in more detail below.\nMention of zakat after prayer suggests that it held a different role than almsgiving. Zakat served as a fine or payment for someone guilty of sin to have Muhammad pray for their purification.\nHadith.\nEach of the most trusted hadith collections in Islam have a book dedicated to zakat. \"Sahih Bukhari\"'s Book 24, \"Sahih Muslim\"'s Book 12, and \"Sunan Abu-Dawud\"'s Book 9 discuss various aspects of zakat, including who must pay, how much, when and what. The 2.5% rate is also mentioned in the hadiths.\nThe hadiths admonish those who do not give the zakat. According to the hadith, refusal to pay or mockery of those who pay zakat is a sign of hypocrisy, and God will not accept the prayers of such people. The sunna also describes God's punishment for those who refuse or fail to pay zakat. On the day of Judgment, those who did not give the zakat will be held accountable and punished.\nThe hadith contain advice on the state-authorized collection of the zakat. The collectors are required not to take more than what is due, and those who are paying the zakat are asked not to evade payment. The hadith also warn of punishment for those who take zakat when they are not eligible to receive it (see Distribution below).\nAmount.\nThe amount of zakat to be paid by an individual depends on the amount of money and the type of assets the individual possesses. The Quran does not provide specific guidelines on which types of wealth are taxable under the zakat, nor does it specify percentages to be given. However, it clearly indicates to donate the \"surplus\" of one's income. But the customary practice in the Islamic world has been that the amount of zakat paid on capital assets (e.g. money) is 2.5% (&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u204440). Zakat is additionally payable on agricultural goods, precious metals, minerals, and livestock at a rate varying between 2.5% and 20% (1/5), depending on the type of goods.\nZakat is usually payable on assets continuously owned over one lunar year that are in excess of the \"nisab\", a minimum monetary value. However, Islamic scholars have disagreed on this issue. For example, Abu Hanifa did not regard the nisab limit to be a pre-requisite for zakat, in the case of land crops, fruits and minerals. Other differences between Islamic scholars on zakat and nisab are acknowledged as follows by Yusuf al-Qaradawi,\nUnlike prayers, we observe that even the ratio, the exemption, the kinds of wealth that are zakatable are subject to differences among scholars. Such differences have serious implications for Muslims at large when it comes to their application of the Islamic obligation of zakat. For example, some scholars consider the wealth of children and insane individuals zakatable, others don't. Some scholars consider all agricultural products zakatable, others restrict zakat to specific kinds only. Some consider debts zakatable, others don't. Similar differences exist for business assets and women's jewelry. Some require certain minimum (nisab) for zakatability, some don't. etc. The same kind of differences also exist about the disbursement of zakat.&lt;br&gt;\u00a0\u2013 Shiekh Mahmud Shaltut\nFailure to pay.\nThe consequence of failure to pay zakat has been a subject of extensive legal debate in traditional Islamic jurisprudence, particularly when a Muslim is willing to pay zakat but refuses to pay it to a certain group or the state. According to classical jurists, if the collector is unjust in the collection of zakat but just in its distribution, the concealment of property from him is allowed. If, on the other hand, the collector is just in the collection but unjust in the distribution, the concealment of property from him is an obligation (\"wajib\"). Furthermore, if the zakat is concealed from a just collector because the property owner wanted to pay his zakat to the poor himself, they held that he should not be punished for it. If collection of zakat by force was not possible, use of military force to extract it was seen as justified, as was done by Abu Bakr during the Ridda Wars, on the argument that refusing to submit to just orders is a form of treason. However, Abu Hanifa, the founder of the Hanafi school, disapproved of fighting when the property owners undertake to distribute the zakat to the poor themselves.\nSome classical jurists held the view that any Muslim who consciously refuses to pay zakat is an apostate, since the failure to believe that it is a religious duty (\"fard\") is a form of unbelief (\"kufr\"), and should be killed. However, prevailing opinion among classical jurists prescribed sanctions such as fines, imprisonment or corporal punishment. Some classical and contemporary scholars such as Ishaq Ibn Rahwayh and Yusuf al-Qaradawi have stated that the person who fails to pay Zakat should have the payment taken from them, along with half of his wealth. Additionally, those who failed to pay the zakat would face God's punishment in the afterlife on the day of Judgment.\nIn modern states where zakat payment is compulsory, failure to pay is regulated by state law similarly to tax evasion.\nDistribution.\nAccording to the Quran's Surah Al-Tawba, there are eight categories of people (\"asnaf\") who qualify to benefit from zakat funds.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Alms-tax is only for the poor and the needy, for those employed to administer it, for those whose hearts are attracted \u02f9to the faith\u02fa, for \u02f9freeing\u02fa slaves, for those in debt, for Allah's cause, and for \u02f9needy\u02fa travellers. \u02f9This is\u02fa an obligation from Allah. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.\nIslamic scholars have traditionally interpreted this verse as identifying the following eight categories of Muslim causes to be the proper recipients of zakat:\nZakat should not be given to one's own parents, grandparents, children, grandchildren, spouses or the descendants of Muhammad.\nNeither the Quran nor the Hadiths specify the relative division of zakat into the above eight categories. According to the Reliance of the Traveller, the Shafi'i school requires zakat is to be distributed equally among the eight categories of recipients, while the Hanafi school permits zakat to be distributed to all the categories, some of them, or just one of them. Classical schools of Islamic law, including Shafi'i, are unanimous that collectors of zakat are to be paid first, with the balance to be distributed equally amongst the remaining seven categories of recipients, even in cases where one group's need is more demanding.\nMuslim scholars disagree whether zakat recipients can include non-Muslims. Islamic scholarship, historically, has taught that only Muslims can be recipients of zakat. In recent times, some state that zakat may be paid to non-Muslims after the needs of Muslims have been met, finding nothing in the Quran or sunna to indicate that zakat should be paid to Muslims only.\nAdditionally, the zakat funds may be spent on the administration of a centralized zakat collection system. Representatives of the Salafi movement include propagation of Islam and any struggle in righteous cause among permissible ways of spending, while others argue that zakat funds should be spent on social welfare and economic development projects, or science and technology education. Some hold spending them for defense to be permissible if a Muslim country is under attack. Also, it is forbidden to disburse zakat funds into investments instead of being given to one of the above eight categories of recipients.\nRole in society.\nThe zakat is considered by Muslims to be an act of piety through which one expresses concern for the well-being of fellow Muslims, as well as preserving social harmony between the wealthy and the poor. Zakat promotes a more equitable redistribution of wealth and fosters a sense of solidarity amongst members of the \"Ummah\".\nHistorical practice.\nZakat, an Islamic practice initiated by the Islamic prophet Muhammad, was first collected on the first day of Muharram. It has played an important role throughout its history. Schact suggests that the idea of zakat may have entered Islam from Judaism, with roots in the Hebrew and Aramaic word \"zakut\". However, some Islamic scholars disagree that the Qur'anic verses on zakat (or zakah) have roots in Judaism.\nThe caliph Abu Bakr, believed by Sunni Muslims to be Muhammad's successor, was the first to institute a statutory zakat system. Abu Bakr established the principle that the zakat must be paid to the legitimate representative of Muhammad's authority (i.e. himself). However certain tribes refused to pay zakat while staying under the name of Islam which was considered apostasy and led ultimately, to the Ridda wars.\nThe second and third caliphs, Umar ibn al-Khattab and Uthman ibn Affan, continued Abu Bakr's codification of the zakat. Uthman also modified the zakat collection protocol by decreeing that only \"apparent\" wealth was taxable, which had the effect of limiting zakat to mostly being paid on agricultural land and produce. During the reign of Ali ibn Abu Talib, the issue of zakat was tied to legitimacy of his government. After Ali, his supporters refused to pay zakat to Muawiyah I, as they did not recognize his legitimacy.\nThe practice of Islamic state-administered zakat was short-lived in Medina. During the reign of Umar bin Abdul Aziz (717\u2013720\u00a0CE), it is reported that no one in Medina needed the zakat. After him, zakat came more to be considered as an individual responsibility. This view changed over Islamic history. Sunni Muslims and rulers, for example, considered collection and disbursement of zakat as one of the functions of an Islamic state; this view has continued in modern Islamic countries.\nZakat is one of the five pillars of Islam, and in various Islamic polities of the past was expected to be paid by all practising Muslims who have the financial means (\"nisab\"). In addition to their zakat obligations, Muslims were encouraged to make voluntary contributions (\"sadaqat\"). The zakat was not collected from non-Muslims, although they were required to pay the \"jizyah\" tax. Depending on the region, the dominant portion of zakat went typically to \"Amil\" (the zakat collectors) or Sab\u012blill\u0101h (those fighting for religious cause, the caretaker of local mosque, or those working in the cause of God such as proselytizing non-Muslims to convert to Islam).\nContemporary practice.\nAccording to the researcher Russell Powell in 2010, zakat was mandatory by state law in Libya, Malaysia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, and Yemen. There were government-run voluntary zakat contribution programs in Bahrain, Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Maldives and the United Arab Emirates.\nIn a 2019 study conducted by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding that examined philanthropy for American Muslims in comparison to other faith and non-faith groups, it was found that for American Muslims, Zakat was an important driver of charitable giving. This results in American Muslims being the most likely faith group studied to be motivated to donate based on a believed religious obligation (zakat), and a \"feeling that those with more should help those with less\", referencing again the concept and religious imperative behind Zakat.\nCollection.\nToday, in most Muslim countries, Zakat is at the discretion of Muslims over how and whether to pay, typically enforced by fear of God, peer pressure, and an individual's personal feelings. Among the Sunni Muslims, Zakat committees, linked to a religious cause or local mosque, collect zakat. Among the Shia Muslims, deputies on behalf of Imams collect the zakat.\nIn six of the 47 Muslim-majority countries\u2014Libya, Malaysia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Yemen\u2014zakat is obligatory and collected by the state. In Jordan, Bahrain, Kuwait, Lebanon, and Bangladesh, the zakat is regulated by the state, but contributions are voluntary.\nThe states where Zakat is compulsory differ in their definition of the base for zakat computation. Zakat is generally levied on livestock (except in Pakistan) and agricultural produce, although the types of taxable livestock and produce differ from country to country. Zakat is imposed on cash and precious metals in four countries with different methods of assessment. Income is subject to zakat in Saudi Arabia and Malaysia, while only Sudan imposes zakat on \"wealth that yields income\". In Pakistan, property is exempt from the zakat calculation basis, and the compulsory zakat is primarily collected from the agriculture sector.\nUnder compulsory systems of zakat tax collection, such as Malaysia and Pakistan, evasion is very common and the zakat (alms tax) is regressive. A considerable number of Muslims accept their duty to pay zakat, but deny that the state has a right to levy it, and they may pay zakat voluntarily while evading official collection. In discretion-based systems of collection, studies suggest zakat is collected from and paid only by a fraction of Muslim population who can pay.\nIn the United Kingdom, which has a Muslim minority, more than three out of ten Muslims gave to charity (Zakat being described as \"the Muslim practice of charitable donations\"), according to a 2013 poll of 4000 people. According to the self-reported poll, British Muslims, on average, gave US$567 to charity in 2013, compared to $412 for Jews, $308 for Protestants, $272 for Catholics and $177 for atheists.\nDistribution.\nThe primary sources of sharia also do not specify to whom the zakat should be paid\u00a0\u2013 to zakat collectors claiming to represent one class of zakat beneficiary (for example, poor), collectors who were representing religious bodies, or collectors representing the Islamic state. This has caused significant conflicts and allegations of zakat abuse within the Islamic community, both historically and in modern times.\n\"Fi Sabillillah\" is the most prominent \"asnaf\" in Southeast Asian Muslim societies, where it broadly construed to include funding missionary work, Quranic schools and anything else that serves the Islamic community (\"ummah\") in general.\nRole in society.\nIn 2012, Islamic financial analysts estimated annual zakat spending between US$200 billion and US$1 trillion per year, which would be at least 15 times more than global humanitarian aid tracked by the United Nations. Islamic scholars and development workers state that much of this zakat practice is mismanaged, wasted or ineffective. About a quarter of the Muslim world continues to live on $1.25 a day or less, according to the 2012 report.\nA 1999 study of Sudan and Pakistan, where zakat is mandated by the state, estimated that zakat proceeds ranged between 0.3 and 0.5 percent of GDP, while a more recent report put zakat proceeds in Malaysia at 0.1% of GDP. These numbers are far below what was expected when the governments of these countries tried to Islamize their economies, and the collected amount is too small to have a sizeable macroeconomic effect.\nIn a 2014 study, Nasim Shirazi states widespread poverty persists in Islamic world despite zakat collections every year. Over 70% of the Muslim population in most Muslim countries is impoverished and lives on less than US$2 per day. In over 10 Muslim-majority countries, over 50% of the population lived on less than $1.25 per day income, states Shirazi. Zakat has so far failed to relieve large scale absolute poverty among Muslims in most Muslim countries.\nRelated terms.\nZakat is required of Muslims only. For non-Muslims living in an Islamic state, sharia was historically seen as mandating \"jizya\" (poll tax). Other forms of taxation on Muslims or non-Muslims, that have been used in Islamic history, include \"kharaj\" (land tax), \"khums\" (tax on booty and loot seized from non-Muslims, sudden wealth), \"ushur\" (tax at state border, sea port, and each city border on goods movement, customs), \"kari\" (house tax) and \"chari\" (sometimes called \"maara\", pasture tax).\nThere are differences in the interpretation and scope of zakat and other related taxes in various sects of Islam. For example, \"khums\" is interpreted differently by Sunnis and Shi'ites, with Shia expected to pay one fifth of their excess income after expenses as \"khums\", while Sunnis do not. At least a tenth part of zakat and \"khums\" every year, among Shi'ites, after its collection by Imam and his religious deputies under its doctrine of \"niyaba\", goes as income for its hierarchical system of Shia clergy. Among Ismaili sub-sect of Shias, the mandatory taxes which includes zakat, is called \"dasond\", and 20% of the collected amount is set aside as income for the Imams. Some branches of Shia Islam treat the right to lead as Imam and right to receive 20% of collected zakat and other alms as a hereditary right of its clergy.\n\"Sadaqah\" is another related term for charity, usually construed as a discretionary counterpart to zakat.\n\"Zakat al-Fitr\".\n\"Zakat al-Fitr\" or \"Sadaqat al-Fitr\" is another, smaller charitable obligation, mandatory for all Muslims\u2014male or female, minor or adult as long as he/she has the means to do so\u2014that is traditionally paid at the end of the fasting in the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. The collected amount is used to pay the zakat collectors and to the poor Muslims so that they may be provided with a means to celebrate 'Eid al-Fitr (the festival of breaking the fast) following Ramadan, along with the rest of the Muslims.\nZakat al-Fitr is a fixed amount assessed per person, while Zakat al mal is based on personal income and property. According to one source, the Hidaya Foundation, the suggested Zakat al Fitr donation is based on the price of 1 Saa (approx. 3\u00a0kg) of rice or wheat at local costs, (as of 2015, approximately $7.00 in the U.S.).\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Per the 2020 United States census, the population was 24,655.\nHistory.\nThe city was founded in 1900 by John Alexander Dowie, a Scots-Australian evangelical minister and faith healer who had migrated to the United States in 1888. By 1890, he had settled in Chicago, where he built a faith healing business that included a mail order component, and he had also attracted thousands of followers.\nHe bought land north of Chicago to found Zion, where he personally owned all of the land and most businesses. The city was named after Mount Zion in Jerusalem.\nDowie also founded the Zion Tabernacle of the Christian Catholic Apostolic Church, which was the only church in town. The structure was built in the early 1900s and was burned down in 1937, following several decades of tumultuous rule by Dowie's successor, Wilbur Glenn Voliva.\nGeography.\nAccording to the 2021 census gazetteer files, Zion has a total area of , of which (or 99.99%) is land and (or 0.01%) is water.\nIllinois Beach State Park.\nZion is the closest municipality to South Beach within Illinois Beach State Park. The North Beach is in Winthrop Harbor. The beach was originally part of Camp Logan, developed in 1892 as a rifle range by the Illinois National Guard. In World War I and World War II, it served as a rifle range for the Great Lakes Naval Training Station. The range remained in operation until 1973, when it was transferred to the Illinois Department of Conservation.\nIn 1950, the Illinois Dunes Preservation Society was established to maintain the natural qualities of the beach. With the help of the Illinois Department of Conservation, the area south of Beach Road was established as the state's first natural preserve. The sections of the northern beach, between Beach Road and the Wisconsin state border, were acquired by the state between 1971 and 1982.\nThe Illinois Beach Resort and Conference Center is located at the south beach. The North Point Marina, one of the largest in the Great Lakes region, is at the north beach. It is Illinois' largest marina.\nOn May 9, 2000, the area encompassing Illinois Beach State Park and North Point Marina was officially designated as the Cullerton Complex in honor of William J. Cullerton Sr., a war hero, avid environmentalist, and long-time friend of conservation.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs of the 2020 census there were 24,655 people, 8,185 households, and 5,394 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 9,295 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 28.72% White, 31.17% African American, 1.93% Native American, 2.23% Asian, 0.09% Pacific Islander, 21.48% from other races, and 14.38% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 38.46% of the population.\nThere were 8,185 households, out of which 37.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 41.31% were married couples living together, 16.38% had a female householder with no husband present, and 34.10% were non-families. 30.67% of all households were made up of individuals, and 9.68% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.57 and the average family size was 2.84.\nThe city's age distribution consisted of 27.0% under the age of 18, 12.2% from 18 to 24, 25% from 25 to 44, 24.5% from 45 to 64, and 11.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 33.0 years. For every 100 females, there were 88.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 88.0 males.\nThe median income for a household in the city was $56,819, and the median income for a family was $66,803. Males had a median income of $37,319 versus $29,416 for females. The per capita income for the city was $23,345. About 12.5% of families and 14.3% of the population were below the poverty line, including 18.3% of those under age 18 and 9.5% of those age 65 or over.\nTransportation.\nThe city is served by Metra's Union Pacific North Line through Zion railway station on the east side. It connects the city to Chicago, Kenosha and intermediate communities. Pace bus line 571 provides internal transit service in Zion and connects the city to Waukegan.\nEducation.\nElementary school districts covering sections of Zion include Zion Elementary School District 6 and Beach Park Community Consolidated School District 3, while the section of Zion in Winthrop Harbor School District 1 is parkland. All of Zion is in the Zion-Benton Township High School District 126.\nSports.\nThe 8,500-seat Fielders Stadium was planned to open in May 2010, and was to host home games for the Lake County Fielders, the North American League baseball team co-owned by the actor Kevin Costner. The Fielders' name is an homage to Costner's 1989 film \"Field of Dreams\", with the logo showing a ballplayer standing in a field of corn.\nFielders Stadium has been subject to a court dispute between its owners and the city over a breach in contract, and was never completed before the Fielders folded.\nUntil the 1940s, Zion enshrined the Flat Earth doctrine in its religious code.\nControversy.\nThe former city seal was the subject of a 1990 Federal Court case, because it featured a crown and scepter, a dove, a cross and the words \"God Reigns\". The founder of Zion and designer of the city seal, John Alexander Dowie, intended for these to be Christian symbols and added them \"for the purpose of the extension of the Kingdom of God upon earth ... where God shall rule in every department of family, industry, commercial, educational, ecclesiastical and political life\". The court ruled the city could not use these religious symbols in its seals and emblems. While the Christian symbolism was removed, the phrase \"In God We Trust\" could be used on the new city seal since it was already acceptable religious language in the public arena.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "34460", "revid": "5718152", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34460", "title": "Zebra", "text": "Black-and-white striped animals in the equid family\nZebras (, ) (subgenus Hippotigris) are African equines with distinctive black-and-white striped coats. There are three living species: Gr\u00e9vy's zebra (\"Equus grevyi\"), the plains zebra (\"E. quagga\"), and the mountain zebra (\"E. zebra\"). Zebras share the genus \"Equus\" with horses and asses, the three groups being the only living members of the family Equidae. Zebra stripes come in different patterns, unique to each individual. Several theories have been proposed for the function of these patterns, with most evidence supporting them as a deterrent for biting flies. Zebras inhabit eastern and southern Africa and can be found in a variety of habitats such as savannahs, grasslands, woodlands, shrublands, and mountainous areas.\nZebras are primarily grazers and can subsist on lower-quality vegetation. They are preyed on mainly by lions, and typically flee when threatened but also bite and kick. Zebra species differ in social behaviour, with plains and mountain zebra living in stable harems consisting of an adult male or stallion, several adult females or mares, and their young or foals; while Gr\u00e9vy's zebra live alone or in loosely associated herds. In harem-holding species, adult females mate only with their harem stallion, while male Gr\u00e9vy's zebras establish territories which attract females and the species is polygynandrous. Zebras communicate with various vocalisations, body postures and facial expressions. Social grooming strengthens social bonds in plains and mountain zebras.\nZebras' dazzling stripes make them among the most recognisable mammals. They have been featured in art and stories in Africa and beyond. Historically, they have been highly sought by exotic animal collectors, but unlike horses and donkeys, zebras have never been completely domesticated. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists Gr\u00e9vy's zebra as endangered, the mountain zebra as vulnerable and the plains zebra as near-threatened. The quagga (\"E. quagga quagga\"), a type of plains zebra, was driven to extinction in the 19th century. Nevertheless, zebras can be found in numerous protected areas.\nEtymology.\nThe English name \"zebra\" derives from Italian, Spanish or Portuguese. Its origins may lie in the Latin \"equiferus\", meaning \"wild horse\". \"Equiferus\" appears to have entered into Portuguese as \"ezebro\" or \"zebro\", which was originally used for a mysterious equine reported in the wilds of the Iberian Peninsula during the Middle Ages. In 1591, Italian explorer Filippo Pigafetta recorded \"zebra\" being used to refer to the African animals by Portuguese visitors to the continent. In ancient times, the zebra was called \"hippotigris\" (\"horse tiger\") by the Greeks and Romans.\nThe word \"zebra\" was traditionally pronounced with a long initial vowel, but over the course of the 20th century the pronunciation with the short initial vowel became the norm in British English. The pronunciation with a long initial vowel remains standard in American English.\nTaxonomy.\nZebras are classified in the genus \"Equus\" (known as equines) along with horses and asses. These three groups are the only living members of the family Equidae. The plains zebra and mountain zebra were traditionally placed in the subgenus \"Hippotigris\" (C. H. Smith, 1841) in contrast to the Gr\u00e9vy's zebra which was considered the sole species of subgenus \"Dolichohippus\" (Heller, 1912). Groves and Bell (2004) placed all three species in the subgenus \"Hippotigris\". A 2013 phylogenetic study found that the plains zebra is more closely related to Gr\u00e9vy's zebras than mountain zebras. The extinct quagga was originally classified as a distinct species. Later genetic studies have placed it as the same species as the plains zebra, either a subspecies or just the southernmost population. Molecular evidence supports zebras as a monophyletic lineage.\n\"Equus\" originated in North America and direct paleogenomic sequencing of a 700,000-year-old middle Pleistocene horse metapodial bone from Canada implies a date of 4.07 million years ago (mya) for the most recent common ancestor of the equines within a range of 4.0 to 4.5 mya. Horses split from asses and zebras around this time and equines colonised Eurasia and Africa around 2.1\u20133.4 mya. Zebras and asses diverged from each other close to 2 mya. The mountain zebra diverged from the other species around 1.6 mya and the plains and Gr\u00e9vy's zebra split 1.4 mya.\nA 2017 mitochondrial DNA study placed the Eurasian \"Equus ovodovi\" and the subgenus \"Sussemionus\" lineage as closer to zebras than to asses. However, other studies disputed this placement, finding the \"Sussemionus\" lineage basal to the zebra+asses group, but suggested that the \"Sussemionus\" lineage may have received gene flow from zebras.\nThe cladogram of \"Equus\" below is based on Vilstrup and colleagues (2013) and J\u00f3nsson and colleagues (2014):\nFossil record.\nIn addition to the three living species, some fossil zebras and relatives have also been identified. \"E. oldowayensis\" is identified from remains in Olduvai Gorge dating to 1.8 mya. Fossil skulls of \"E. mauritanicus\" from Algeria which date to around 1 mya appears to show affinities with the plains zebra. \"E. capensis\", known as the Cape zebra, appeared around 2 mya and lived throughout southern and eastern Africa.\nHybridisation.\nFertile hybrids have been reported in the wild between plains and Gr\u00e9vy's zebra. Hybridisation has also been recorded between the plains and mountain zebra, though it is possible that these are infertile due to the difference in chromosome numbers between the two species. Captive zebras have been bred with horses and donkeys; these are known as zebroids. A zorse is a cross between a zebra and a horse; a zonkey, between a zebra and a donkey; and a zoni, between a zebra and a pony. Zebroids are often born sterile with dwarfism.\nCharacteristics.\nAs with all wild equines, zebras have barrel-chested bodies with tufted tails, elongated faces and long necks with long, erect manes. Their thin legs are each supported by a spade-shaped toe covered in a hard hoof. Their dentition is adapted for grazing; they have large incisors that clip grass blades and rough molars and premolars well suited for grinding. Males have spade-shaped canines, which can be used as weapons in fighting. The eyes of zebras are at the sides and far up the head, which allows them to look over the tall grass while feeding. Their moderately long, erect ears are movable and can locate the source of a sound.\nUnlike horses, zebras and asses have chestnut callosities present only on their front legs. In contrast to other living equines, zebras have longer front legs than back legs. Diagnostic traits of the zebra skull include: its relatively small size with a straight dorsal outline, protruding eye sockets, narrower rostrum, less conspicuous postorbital bar, separation of the metaconid and metastylid of the tooth by a V-shaped canal and rounded enamel wall.\nStripes.\nZebras are easily recognised by their bold black-and-white striping patterns. The coat appears to be white with black stripes, as indicated by the belly and legs when unstriped, but the skin is black. Young or foals are born with brown and white coats, and the brown darkens with age. A dorsal stripe acts as the backbone for vertical stripes along the sides, from the head to the rump. On the snout they curve toward the nostrils, while the stripes above the front legs split into two branches. On the rump, they develop into species-specific patterns. The stripes on the legs, ears and tail are separate and horizontal.\nStriping patterns are unique to an individual and heritable. During embryonic development, the stripes appear at eight months, but the patterns may be determined at three to five weeks. For each species there is a point in embryonic development where the stripes are perpendicular to the dorsal line and spaced apart. However, this happens at three weeks of development for the plains zebra, four weeks for the mountain zebra, and five for Gr\u00e9vy's zebra. The difference in timing is thought to be responsible for the differences in the striping patterns of the different species.\nVarious abnormalities of the patterns have been documented in plains zebras. In \"melanistic\" zebras, dark stripes are highly concentrated on the torso but the legs are whiter. \"Spotted\" individuals have broken up black stripes around the dorsal area. There have even been morphs with white spots on dark backgrounds. Striping abnormalities have been linked to inbreeding. Albino zebras have been recorded in the forests of Mount Kenya, with the dark stripes being blonde. The quagga had brown and white stripes on the head and neck, brown upper parts and a white belly, tail and legs.\nFunction.\nThe function of stripes in zebras has been discussed among biologists since at least the 19th century. Popular hypotheses include the following:\nBehaviour and ecology.\nZebras may travel or migrate to wetter areas during the dry season. Plains zebras have been recorded travelling between Namibia and Botswana, the longest land migration of mammals in Africa. When migrating, they appear to rely on some memory of the locations where foraging conditions were best and may predict conditions months after their arrival. Plains zebras are more water-dependent and live in moister environments than other species. They usually can be found from a water source. Gr\u00e9vy's zebras can survive almost a week without water but will drink it every day when given the chance, and their bodies maintain water better than cattle. Mountain zebras can be found at elevations of up to . Zebras sleep up to seven hours a day, standing up during the day and lying down during the night. They regularly use various objects as rubbing posts and will roll on the ground.\nA zebra's diet is mostly grasses and sedges, but they will opportunistically consume bark, leaves, buds, fruits, and roots. Compared to ruminants, zebras have a simpler and less efficient digestive system. Nevertheless, they can subsist on lower-quality vegetation. Zebras may spend 60\u201380% of their time feeding, depending on the availability of vegetation. The plains zebra is a pioneer grazer, mowing down the upper, less nutritious grass canopy and preparing the way for more specialised grazers like wildebeest, which depend on shorter and more nutritious grasses below.\nZebras are preyed on mainly by lions. Leopards, cheetahs, spotted hyenas, brown hyenas and wild dogs pose less of a threat to adults. Biting and kicking are a zebra's defense tactics. When threatened by lions, zebras flee, and when caught they are rarely effective in fighting off the big cats. In one study, the maximum speed of a zebra was found to be while a lion was measured at . Zebras do not escape lions by speed alone but by sideways turning, especially when the cat is close behind. With smaller predators like hyenas and dogs, zebras may act more aggressively, especially in defense of their young.\nSocial behaviour.\nZebra species have two basic social structures. Plains and mountain zebras live in stable, closed family groups or harems consisting of one stallion, several mares, and their offspring. These groups have their own home ranges, which overlap, and they tend to be nomadic. Stallions form and expand their harems by herding young mares away from their birth harems. The stability of the group remains even when the family stallion is displaced. Plains zebras groups gather into large herds and may create temporarily stable subgroups within a herd, allowing individuals to interact with those outside their group. Females in harems can spend more time feeding, and gain protection both for them and their young. They have a linear dominance hierarchy with the high-ranking females having lived in the group longest. While traveling, the most dominant females and their offspring lead the group, followed by the next most dominant; the family stallion trails behind. Young of both sexes leave their natal groups as they mature; females are usually herded by outside males to become part of their harems.\nIn the more arid-living Gr\u00e9vy's zebras, adults have more fluid associations and adult males establish large territories, marked by dung piles, and mate with the females that enter them. Grazing and drinking areas tend to be separated in these environments and the most dominant males establish territories near watering holes, which attract females with dependent foals and those who simply want a drink, while less dominant males control territories away from water with more vegetation, and only attract mares without foals. Mares may travel through several territories but remain in one when they have young. Staying in a territory offers a female protection from harassment by outside males, as well as access to resources.\nIn all species, excess males gather in bachelor groups. These are typically young males that are not yet ready to establish a harem or territory. With the plains zebra, the oldest males are the most dominant and group membership is stable. Bachelor groups tend to be at the boundaries of herds and during group movements, the bachelors follow behind or along the sides. Mountain zebra bachelor groups may also include young females that have left their natal group early, as well as old, former harem males. A territorial Gr\u00e9vy's zebra stallion may allow non-territorial bachelors in their territory, however when a mare in oestrous is present the territorial stallion keeps other stallions at bay. Bachelors prepare for their future harem roles with play fights and greeting/challenge rituals, which make up most of their activities.\nFights between males usually occur over mates and involve biting and kicking. In plains zebra, stallions fight each other over recently matured mares to bring into their group and her father will fight off all suitors trying to abduct her. As long as a harem stallion is healthy, he is not usually challenged. Only unhealthy stallions have their harems taken over, and even then, the new stallion slowly takes over, peacefully displacing the old one. Agonistic behaviour between male Gr\u00e9vy's zebras occurs at the border of their territories.\nCommunication.\nZebras produce a number of vocalisations and noises. The plains zebra has a distinctive, barking contact call heard as \"a-\"ha\", a-\"ha\", a-\"ha\"\" or \"kwa-ha, kaw-ha, ha, ha\". The mountain zebra may produce a similar sound while the call of Gr\u00e9vy's zebra has been described as \"something like a hippo's grunt combined with a donkey's wheeze\". Loud snorting and rough \"gasping\" in zebras signals alarm. Squealing is usually made when in pain, but can also be heard in friendly interactions. Zebras also communicate with visual displays, and the flexibility of their lips allows them to make complex facial expressions. Visual displays also consist of head, ear, and tail postures. A zebra may signal an intention to kick by dropping back its ears and whipping its tail. Flattened ears, bared teeth and a waving head may be used as threatening gestures by stallions.\nIndividuals may greet each other by mutually touching and rubbing, sniffing their genitals and resting their heads on their shoulders. They then may caress their shoulders against each other and lay their heads on one another. This greeting usually occurs between harem or territorial males or among bachelor males playing. Plains and mountain zebras strengthen their social bonds with grooming. Members of a harem nibble and rake along the neck, shoulder, and back with their teeth and lips. Grooming usually occurs between mothers and foals and between stallions and mares. Grooming establishes social rank and eases aggressive behaviour, although Gr\u00e9vy's zebras generally do not perform social grooming.\nReproduction and parenting.\nAmong plains and mountain zebras, the adult females mate only with their harem stallion, while in Gr\u00e9vy's zebras, mating is more polygynandrous and the males have larger testes for sperm competition. Female zebras have five to ten day long oestrous cycles; physical signs include a swollen, everted (inside out) labia and copious flows of urine and mucus. Upon reaching peak oestrous, mares spread-out their legs, lift their tails and open their mouths when in the presence of a male. Males assess the female's reproductive state with a curled lip and bared teeth (flehmen response) and the female will solicit mating by backing in. Gestation is typically around a year. A few days to a month later, mares can return to oestrus. In harem-holding species, oestrus in a female becomes less noticeable to outside males as she gets older, hence competition for older females is virtually nonexistent.\nUsually, a single foal is born, which is capable of running within an hour of birth. A newborn zebra will follow anything that moves, so new mothers prevent other mares from approaching their foals as they become more familiar with the mother's striping pattern, smell and voice. At a few weeks old, foals begin to graze, but may continue to nurse for eight to thirteen months. Living in an arid environment, Gr\u00e9vy's zebras have longer nursing intervals and young only begin to drink water three months after birth.\nIn plains and mountain zebras, foals are cared for mostly by their mothers, but if threatened by pack-hunting hyenas and dogs, the entire group works together to protect all the young. The group forms a protective front with the foals in the centre, and the stallion will rush at predators that come too close. In Gr\u00e9vy's zebras, young stay in \"kindergartens\" when their mothers leave for water. These groups are tended to by the territorial male. A stallion may look after a foal in his territory to ensure that the mother stays, though it may not be his. By contrast, plains zebra stallions are generally intolerant of foals that are not theirs and may practice infanticide and feticide via violence to the pregnant mare.\nHuman relations.\nCultural significance.\nWith their distinctive black-and-white stripes, zebras are among the most recognizable mammals. They have been associated with beauty and grace, with naturalist Thomas Pennant describing them in 1781 as \"the most elegant of quadrupeds\". Zebras have been popular in photography, with some wildlife photographers describing them as the most photogenic animal. They have become staples in children's stories and wildlife-themed art, such as depictions of Noah's Ark. In children's alphabet books, the animals are often used to represent the letter 'Z'. Zebra stripe patterns are popularly used for body paintings, dress, furniture and architecture.\nZebras have been featured in African art and culture for millennia. They are depicted in rock art in Southern Africa dating from 28,000 to 20,000 years ago, though less often than antelope species like eland. How the zebra got its stripes has been the subject of folk tales, some of which involve it being scorched by fire. The Maasai proverb \"a man without culture is like a zebra without stripes\" has become popular in Africa. The San people connected zebra stripes with water, rain and lightning, and water spirits were conceived of having these markings.\nFor the Shona people, the zebra is a totem animal and is glorified in a poem as an \"iridescent and glittering creature\". Its stripes have symbolised the union of male and female and at the ruined city of Great Zimbabwe, zebra stripes decorate what is believed to be a \"domba\", a school meant to prepare girls for adulthood. In the Shona language, the name \"madhuve\" means \"woman/women of the zebra totem\" and is a name for girls in Zimbabwe. The plains zebra is the national animal of Botswana and zebras have been depicted on stamps during colonial and post-colonial Africa. For people of the African diaspora, the zebra represented the politics of race and identity, being both black and white.\nIn cultures outside of its range, the zebra has been thought of as a more exotic alternative to the horse; the comic book character Sheena, Queen of the Jungle, is depicted riding a zebra and explorer Osa Johnson was photographed riding one. The film \"Racing Stripes\" features a captive zebra ostracised from the horses and ends up being ridden by a rebellious girl. Zebras have been featured as characters in animated films like \"Khumba\", \"The Lion King\" and the \"Madagascar\" films and television series such as \"Zou\".\nZebras have been popular subjects for abstract, modernist and surrealist artists. Such art includes Christopher Wood's \"Zebra and Parachute\", Lucian Freud's \"The Painter's Room\" and \"Quince on a Blue Table\" and the various paintings of Mary Fedden and Sidney Nolan. Victor Vasarely depicted zebras as black and white lines and connected in a jigsaw puzzle fashion. Carel Weight's \"Escape of the Zebra from the Zoo during an Air Raid\" was based on a real life incident of a zebra escaping during the bombing of London Zoo and consists of four comic book-like panels. Zebras have lent themselves to products and advertisements, including for 'Zebra Grate Polish' cleaning supplies by British manufacturer Reckitt and Sons and Japanese pen manufacturer Zebra Co., Ltd.\nCaptivity.\nZebras have been kept in captivity since at least the Roman Empire. In later times, captive zebras have been shipped around the world, often for diplomatic reasons. In 1261, Sultan Baibars of Egypt established an embassy with Alfonso X of Castile and sent a zebra and other exotic animals as gifts. In 1417, a zebra was gifted to the Chinese people by Somalia and displayed before the Yongle Emperor. The fourth Mughal emperor Jahangir received a zebra from Ethiopia in 1620 and Ustad Mansur made a painting of it. In the 1670s, Ethiopian Emperor Yohannes I exported two zebras to the Dutch governor of Jakarta. These animals would eventually be given by the Dutch to the Tokugawa Shogunate of Japan.\nWhen Queen Charlotte received a zebra as a wedding gift in 1762, the animal became a source of fascination for the people of Britain. Many flocked to see it at its paddock at Buckingham Palace. It soon became the subject of humour and satire, being referred to as \"The Queen's Ass\", and was the subject of an oil painting by George Stubbs in 1763. The zebra also gained a reputation for being ill-tempered and kicked at visitors. In 1882, Ethiopia sent a zebra to French president Jules Gr\u00e9vy, and the species it belonged to was named in his honour.\nAttempts to domesticate zebras were largely unsuccessful. It is possible that having evolved under pressure from the many large predators of Africa, including early humans, they became more aggressive, thus making domestication more difficult. However, zebras have been trained throughout history. In Rome, zebras are recorded to have pulled chariots during amphitheatre games starting in the reign of Caracalla (198 to 217 AD). In the late 19th century, the zoologist Walter Rothschild trained some zebras to draw a carriage in England, which he drove to Buckingham Palace to demonstrate that it can be done. However, he did not ride on them knowing that they were too small and aggressive. In the early 20th century, German colonial officers in East Africa tried to use zebras for both driving and riding, with limited success.\nConservation.\nAs of 2016\u20132019, the IUCN Red List of mammals lists Gr\u00e9vy's zebra as endangered, the mountain zebra as vulnerable and the plains zebra as near-threatened. Gr\u00e9vy's zebra populations are estimated at less than 2,000 mature individuals, but they are stable. Mountain zebras number near 35,000 individuals and their population appears to be increasing. Plains zebra are estimated to number 150,000\u2013250,000 with a decreasing population trend. Human intervention has fragmented zebra ranges and populations. Zebras are threatened by hunting for their hide and meat, and habitat destruction. They also compete with livestock and have their travelling routes obstruct by fences. Civil wars in some countries have also caused declines in zebra populations. By the early 20th century, zebra skins were being used to make rugs and chairs. In the 21st century, zebras may be taken by trophy hunters as zebra skin rugs sell for $1,000 to $2,000. Trophy hunting was rare among African peoples though the San were known to hunt zebra for meat.\nThe quagga (\"E. quagga quagga\") population was hunted by early Dutch settlers and later by Afrikaners to provide meat or for their skins. The skins were traded or used locally. The quagga was probably vulnerable to extinction due to its restricted range, and because they were easy to find in large groups. The last known wild quagga died in 1878. The last captive quagga, a female in Amsterdam's Natura Artis Magistra zoo, lived there from 9\u00a0May 1867 until it died on 12\u00a0August 1883. The Cape mountain zebra, a subspecies of mountain zebra, nearly went extinct due to hunting and habitat destruction, with less than 50 individuals left by the 1950s. Protections from South African National Parks allowed the population to rise to 2,600 by the 2010s.\nZebras can be found in numerous protected areas. Important areas for Gr\u00e9vy's zebra include Yabelo Wildlife Sanctuary and Chelbi Sanctuary in Ethiopia and Buffalo Springs, Samburu and Shaba National Reserves in Kenya. The plains zebra inhabits the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, Tsavo and Masai Mara in Kenya, Hwange National Park in Zimbabwe, Etosha National Park in Namibia, and Kruger National Park in South Africa. Mountain zebras are protected in Mountain Zebra National Park, Karoo National Park and Goegap Nature Reserve in South Africa as well as Etosha and Namib-Naukluft Park in Namibia.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral bibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "34461", "revid": "199747", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34461", "title": "Zilog Z80", "text": "8-bit microprocessor\nThe Zilog Z80 is an 8-bit microprocessor designed by Zilog that played an important role in the evolution of early personal computing. Launched in 1976, it was designed to be software-compatible with the Intel 8080, offering a compelling alternative due to its better integration and increased performance. Along with the 8080's seven registers and flags register, the Z80 introduced an alternate register set, two 16-bit index registers, and additional instructions, including bit manipulation and block copy/search.\nOriginally intended for use in embedded systems like the 8080 was, the Z80's combination of compatibility, affordability, and superior performance led to widespread adoption in video game systems and home computers throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s, helping to fuel the personal computing revolution. The Z80 was used in iconic products such as the Osborne 1, Radio Shack TRS-80, ColecoVision, ZX Spectrum, Sega's Master System and the \"Pac-Man\" arcade cabinet. In the early 1990s, it was used in portable devices, including the Game Gear and the TI-83 series of graphing calculators.\nThe Z80 was the brainchild of Federico Faggin, a key figure behind the creation of the Intel 8080. After leaving Intel in 1974, he co-founded Zilog with Ralph Ungermann. The Z80 debuted in July 1976, and its success allowed Zilog to establish its own chip factories. For initial production, Zilog licensed the Z80 to U.S.-based Synertek and Mostek, along with European second-source manufacturer, SGS. The design was also copied by various Japanese, Eastern European, and Soviet manufacturers gaining global market acceptance as major companies like NEC, Toshiba, Sharp, and Hitachi produced their own versions or compatible clones.\nThe Z80 continued to be used in embedded systems for many years, despite the introduction of more powerful processors; it remained in production until June 2024, 48 years after its original release. Zilog also continued to enhance the basic design of the Z80 with several successors, including the Z180, Z280, and Z380, with the latest iteration, the eZ80, introduced in 2001 and available for purchase as of 2025[ [update]].\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nAt Fairchild Semiconductor, and later at Intel, physicist and engineer Federico Faggin had been working on fundamental transistor and semiconductor manufacturing technology. He also developed the basic design methodology used for memories and microprocessors at Intel and led the work on the Intel 4004, the Intel 8080 and several other ICs. Masatoshi Shima was the principal logic and transistor-level designer of the 4004 and the 8080 under Faggin's supervision, while Ralph Ungermann was in charge of custom integrated circuit design.\nIn early 1974, Intel viewed microprocessors not so much as products to be sold on their own but as a way to sell more of its main products, static RAM and ROM. A reorganization placed some of the formerly independent sections under the direction of Les Vadasz, further diluting the microprocessor's place in the company. That year, the 1973\u20131975 recession reached a peak, and Intel laid off several employees. All of this led to Faggin becoming restless, and he invited Ungermann out for drinks and asked if he would be interested in starting their own company. Ungermann immediately agreed, and as he had less to do at Intel, he left in August or September, followed by Faggin, whose last day at Intel was Halloween 1974. When Shima heard, he asked to come to the new company as well, but having no actual product design or money, they told him to wait.\nThe newly formed and unnamed company initially began designing a single-chip microcontroller called the 2001. They met with Synertek to discuss fabrication on their lines, and when Faggin began to understand the costs involved, it became clear that a low-cost product like this would not be able to compete with a design from a company with its own production lines, like Intel. They then began considering a more complex microprocessor instead, initially known as the Super 80, with the main feature being its use of a +5\u00a0V bus instead of the more common \u22125, +5 and 12\u00a0V used by designs like the 8080. The new design was intended to be compatible with the 8080, but add a number of the features of the Motorola 6800, including index registers and improved interrupts.\nExxon investment, detailed development begins.\nWhile still being set up, the industry newsletter \"Electronic News\" heard of them and published a story on the newly formed company. This attracted the attention of Exxon Enterprises, Exxon's high-tech investment arm. At the time, in the midst of the recession, there was little venture capital available, with a total of $10 million for the entire industry being spent in all of 1975 (equivalent to $\u00a0million in 2024). Someone from Exxon contacted the still-unnamed company, and arranged a meeting that eventually led to them providing an initial $500,000 funding in June 1975 (equivalent to $\u00a0million in 2024).\nWith funding being discussed and a design to be built, Masatoshi Shima joined in February 1975. Shima immediately set about producing a high-level design, adding several concepts of his own. In particular, he used his experience on NEC minicomputers to add the concept of two sets of processor registers so they could quickly respond to interrupts. Ungerman began the development of a series of related controllers and peripheral chips that would complement the design.\nThrough this period, Shima developed a legendary reputation for being able to convert logic concepts into physical design in realtime; while discussing a proposed feature, he would often interrupt and state how much room that would take on the chip and veto its addition if it was too large. The first pass at the design was complete by April 1975. Shima had completed a logic layout by the beginning of May. A second version of the logic design was issued on August 7 and the bus details by September 16. Tape-out was completed in November and converting the tape into a production mask required two more months.\nFaggin had already started looking for a production partner. By this time, Synertek and Mostek had both set up the depletion-mode production lines that could be used to produce the design. Having talked to Synertek previously, Faggin approached them first. However, the president of Synertek demanded that the company be given a second source license, allowing them to sell the design directly. Faggin thought this would mean they could never compete even if they set up their own lines, and the agreement fell through. He then turned to Mostek, who agreed to a term of exclusivity while Zilog got their lines set up, and was eventually given the second source agreement.\nAfter considering multiple names for the new company, and finding them so unmemorable they could not recall them even a day later, Faggin and Ungermann were kicking around ideas based on \"integrated logic\" when Ungermann said, \"How about Zilog?\" Faggin immediately agreed, stating they could say it was the \"last word in integrated logic\". When they met the next day and both immediately recalled it, the company had its name.\nInto production.\nThe first samples were returned from Mostek on March 9, 1976. By the end of the month, they had also completed an assembler-based development system. Some of the Z80 support and peripheral ICs were under development at this point, and some of them were launched during the following year. Among them were the Z80 CTC (counter/timer), Z80 DMA (direct memory access), Z80 DART (dual asynchronous receiver\u2013transmitter), Z80 SIO (synchronous communication controller), and Z80 PIO (parallel input/output).\nThe Z80 was officially launched in July 1976. At the time, concerns existed within the semiconductor industry about the unlicensed reproduction of chip designs by foreign manufacturers. To help deter reverse engineering, the Zilog team incorporated six \"traps\", transistors that were subtly modified to behave differently than their appearance would suggest. According to Shima, an engineer at NEC later told him that these traps delayed their reverse engineering efforts by six months. NEC later settled a patent infringement dispute with Zilog, securing a license to produce authorized versions of the Z80 and other chips.\nFollowing the successful launch of the Z80, Faggin and Ungermann approached Exxon for funding to establish semiconductor fabrication plant. Exxon agreed, and Zilog built its own production line, enabling the company to capture an estimated 60 to 70 percent of the total market for Z80 sales. Meanwhile, Mostek was authorized to produce a licensed version of the chip, the MK3880, providing a second source for customers, a safeguard that Intel lacked. At the time, second-source agreements were considered essential, particularly for startups like Zilog, which carried a higher risk of business failure and supply disruption.\nComparison with the 8080.\nFaggin designed the instruction set to be binary compatible with the 8080 so that most 8080 code, notably the CP/M operating system and Intel's PL/M compiler for 8080 (as well as its generated code), would run unmodified on the new Z80 CPU. Masatoshi Shima designed most of the microarchitecture as well as the gate and transistor levels of the Z80 CPU, assisted by a small number of engineers and layout people. CEO Federico Faggin was actually heavily involved in the chip layout work, together with two dedicated layout people. According to Faggin, he worked 80\u00a0hours a week in order to meet the tight schedule given by the financial investors.\nThe Z80 offered multiple improvements over the 8080:\nSuccess in the market.\nThe Z80 took over from the 8080 and its offspring, the 8085, in the processor market and became one of the most popular and widely used 8-bit CPUs. Some organizations such as British Telecom remained loyal to the 8085 for embedded applications, owing to their familiarity with it and to its on-chip serial interface and interrupt architecture. Likewise, Zenith Data Systems paired the 8085 with the 16-bit Intel\u00a08088 in its first MS-DOS computer, the Zenith Z-100, despite having previous experience with its pioneering Z80-based Heathkit\u00a0H89 and Zenith\u00a0Z-89 products. However, other computers were made integrating the Z80 with other CPUs: the Radio Shack TRS-80 Model\u00a016 with a Motorola 68000, the DEC Rainbow with an 8088, and the Commodore\u00a0128 with a MOS\u00a0Technology 8502.\nZilog was later producing a low-power Z80 suitable for the growing laptop computer market of the early 1980s. Intel produced a CMOS 8085 (80C85) used in battery-powered portable computers, such as the Kyocera-designed laptop from April 1983, also sold by Tandy (as TRS-80 Model\u00a0100), Olivetti, and NEC. In following years, however, CMOS versions of the Z80 (from both Zilog and Japanese manufacturers) would dominate this market as well, in products such as the Amstrad NC100, Cambridge\u00a0Z88 and Tandy's own WP-2.\nPerhaps a key to the initial success of the Z80 was the built-in DRAM refresh, at least in markets such as CP/M and other office and home computers. (Most Z80 embedded systems use static RAM that do not need refresh.) It may also have been its minimalistic two-level interrupt system, or conversely, its general multi-level daisy-chain interrupt system useful in servicing multiple Z80 IO chips. These features allowed systems to be built with less support hardware and simpler circuit board layouts.\nHowever, others claim that its popularity was due to the duplicated registers that allowed fast context switches or more efficient processing of things like floating-point math compared to 8-bit CPUs with fewer registers. (The Z80 can keep several such numbers internally, using HL'HL, DE'DE and BC'BC as 32-bits registers, avoiding having to access them from slower RAM during computation.)\nFor the original NMOS design, the specified upper clock-frequency limit increased successively from the introductory 2.5\u00a0MHz, via the well known 4\u00a0MHz (Z80A), up to 6\u00a0MHz (Z80B) and 8\u00a0MHz (Z80H). An NMOS version was produced as a 10\u00a0MHz part beginning in the late 1980s. CMOS versions were developed with specified upper frequency limits ranging from 4\u00a0MHz up to 20\u00a0MHz for the version sold today. The CMOS versions allowed low-power standby with internal state retained, having no \"lower\" frequency limit. The fully compatible derivatives HD64180/Z180 and eZ80 are currently specified for up to 33\u00a0MHz and 50\u00a0MHz, respectively.\nDesign.\nProgramming model and register set.\nThe programming model and register set of the Z80 are fairly conventional, ultimately based on the register structure of the Datapoint 2200. The Z80 was designed as an extension of the Intel 8080, created by the same engineers, which in turn was an extension of the 8008. The 8008 was basically a PMOS implementation of the TTL-based CPU of the Datapoint 2200.\nThe 2200 design allowed 8-bit registers H and L (High and Low) to be paired into a 16-bit address register HL. In the 8080, this pairing was added to the BC and DE pairs as well, while HL was generalized to allow use as a 16-bit accumulator, not just an address register. The 8080 also introduced immediate 16-bit data for BC, DE, HL, and SP loads. Furthermore, direct 16-bit copying between HL and memory was now possible, using a direct address.\nThe Z80 orthogonalized this further by making all 16-bit register pairs, including IX and IY, more general purpose, as well as allowing 16-bit copying directly to and from memory for all of these pairs. The 16-bit IX and IY registers in the Z80 are primarily intended as base address-registers, where a particular instruction supplies a constant offset that is added to the previous values, but they are also usable as 16-bit accumulators, among other things. A limitation is that all operand references involving IX or IY require an extra instruction prefix byte, adding at least four clock cycles over the timing of an instruction using HL instead; this sometimes makes using IX or IY less efficient than a method using only the 8080-model registers. The Z80 also introduced a new signed overflow flag and complemented the fairly simple 16-bit arithmetics of the 8080 with dedicated instructions for \"signed\" 16-bit arithmetics.\nThe 8080-compatible registers AF, BC, DE, HL are duplicated as a separate register file in the Z80, where the processor can quickly (in four t-states, the least possible execution time for any Z80 instruction) switch from one bank to the other; a feature useful for speeding up responses to single-level, high-priority interrupts. The dual register-set is useful in the embedded role, as it improves interrupt handling performance, but found widespread use in the personal computer role as an additional set of general registers for complex code like floating-point arithmetic or home computer games.\nThe duplicate register file is often referred to as the \"alternate register set\" (by some, the \"primed\" register file since the apostrophe character is used to denote them in assembler source code and the Zilog documentation). This emphasizes that only one set is addressable at any time. However, the 8-bit accumulator A with its flag register F is bifurcated from the \"general purpose\" register pairs HL, DE and BC. This is accomplished with two separate instructions used to swap their accessibilities: codice_1 exchanges only register pair AF with AF', while the codice_2 instruction exchanges the three general purpose register pairs HL, DE and BC with their alternates HL', DE' and BC'. Thus the accumulator A can interact independently with any of the general purpose 8-bit registers in the alternate (or primed) register file, or, if HL' contains a pointer to memory, some byte there (DE' and BC' can also transfer 8-bit data between memory and accumulator A).\nThis can become confusing for programmers because after executing codice_1 or codice_2, the contents of the alternate (primed) registers are now in the main registers, and vice versa. The only way for the programmer to understand and track this swapped condition is to trace through the code flow, noting each occurrence of a register swap instruction. Obviously if jump and call instructions are made within these code segments it can quickly become difficult to tell which register file is in context unless carefully commented. Thus it is advisable that exchange instructions be used directly and in short discrete code segments. The Zilog Z280 instruction set includes codice_5 and codice_6 instructions which jump to a destination address if the alternate registers are in context (thus officially recognizing this programming complication).\nRegisters.\nAs on the 8080, 8-bit registers are typically paired to provide 16-bit versions. The 8080 compatible registers are:\nThe new registers introduced with the Z80 are:\nThe \"refresh register\", codice_16, increments each time the CPU fetches an opcode (or an opcode prefix, which internally executes like a 1-byte instruction) and has no simple relationship with program execution. This has sometimes been used to generate pseudorandom numbers in games, and also in software protection schemes. It has also been employed as a \"hardware\" counter in some designs; an example of this is the ZX81, which lets it keep track of character positions on the TV screen by triggering an interrupt at wrap around (by connecting INT to A6).\nThe \"interrupt vector register\", codice_15, is used for the Z80 specific mode 2 interrupts (selected by the codice_26 instruction). It supplies the high byte of the base address for a 128-entry table of service routine addresses which are selected via an index sent to the CPU during an interrupt acknowledge cycle; this index is simply the low byte part of the pointer to the tabulated indirect address pointing to the service routine. The pointer identifies a particular peripheral chip or peripheral function or event, where the chips are normally connected in a so-called daisy chain for priority resolution. Like the refresh register, this register has also sometimes been used creatively; in interrupt modes 0 and 1 (or in a system not using interrupts) it can be used as simply another 8-bit data register.\nThe instructions codice_27 and codice_28 affect the Z80 flags register, unlike all the other codice_29 (load) instructions. The Sign (bit 7) and Zero (bit 6) flags are set according to the data loaded from the Refresh or Interrupt source registers. For both instructions, the Parity/Overflow flag (bit 2) is set according to the current state of the IFF2 flip-flop.\nMicroarchitecture.\nAlthough the Z80 is generally considered an eight-bit CPU, it has a four-bit ALU, so calculations are done in two steps.\nZ80 assembly language.\nDatapoint 2200 and Intel 8008.\nThe first Intel 8008 assembly language was based on a simple (but systematic) syntax inherited from the Datapoint 2200 design. This original syntax was later transformed into a new, somewhat more traditional, assembly language form for this same original 8008 chip. At about the same time, the new assembly language was also extended to accommodate the additional addressing modes in the more advanced Intel 8080 chip (the 8008 and 8080 shared a language subset without being binary compatible; however, the 8008 was binary compatible with the Datapoint 2200).\nIn this process, the mnemonic codice_30, for \"LOAD\", was replaced by various abbreviations of the words \"LOAD\", \"STORE\" and \"MOVE\", intermixed with other symbolic letters. The mnemonic letter codice_31, for \"memory\" (referenced by HL), was lifted out from within the instruction mnemonic to become a syntactically freestanding \"operand\", while registers and combinations of registers became inconsistently denoted; either by abbreviated operands (MVI D, LXI H and so on), within the instruction mnemonic itself (LDA, LHLD and so on), or both at the same time (LDAX B, STAX D and so on).\n\"Illustration of four syntaxes, using samples of equivalent, or (for 8086) very similar, load and store instructions. The Z80 syntax uses parentheses around an expression to indicate that the value should be used as a memory address (as mentioned below), while the 8086 syntax uses brackets instead of ordinary parentheses for this purpose. Both Z80 and 8086 use the + sign to indicate that a constant is added to a base register to form an address. Note that the 8086 is not a complete superset of the Z80. BX is the only 8086 register pair that can be used as a pointer.\"\nNew syntax.\nBecause Intel claimed a copyright on their assembly mnemonics, a new assembly syntax had to be developed for the Z80. This time a more systematic approach was used:\nThese principles made it straightforward to find names and forms for all new Z80 instructions, as well as orthogonalizations of old ones, such as codice_35.\nThere was at least one inconsistency introduced. Even though a subtract with carry is coded as codice_36, the non-carry subtract is coded as codice_37 rather than codice_38.\nApart from naming differences, and despite a certain discrepancy in basic register structure, the Z80 and 8086 syntax are virtually isomorphic for a large portion of instructions. Only quite superficial similarities (such as the word MOV, or the letter X, for extended register) exist between the 8080 and 8086 assembly languages, although 8080 programs can be translated to 8086 assembly language by translator programs.\nInstruction set and encoding.\nThe Z80 uses 252 out of the available 256 codes as single byte opcodes (\"root instruction\" most of which are inherited from the 8080); the four remaining codes are used extensively as opcode prefixes: CB and ED enable extra instructions, and DD or FD select IX+d or IY+d respectively (in some cases without displacement d) in place of HL. This scheme gives the Z80 a large number of permutations of instructions and registers; Zilog categorizes these into 158 different \"instruction types\", 78 of which are the same as those of the Intel 8080 (allowing operation of all 8080 programs on a Z80). The Zilog documentation further groups instructions into the following categories (most from the 8080, others entirely new like the block and bit instructions, and others 8080 instructions with more versatile addressing modes, like the 16-bit loads, I/O, rotates/shifts and relative jumps):\nNo explicit multiply instructions are available in the original Z80, though registers A and HL can be multiplied by powers of two with ADD\u00a0A,A and ADD\u00a0HL,HL instructions (similarly IX and IY also). Shift instructions can also multiply or divide by powers of two.\nDifferent sizes and variants of additions, shifts, and rotates have somewhat differing effects on flags because most of the flag-changing properties of the 8080 were copied. However, the parity flag bit\u00a0P of the 8080 (bit\u00a02) is called P/V (parity/overflow) in the Z80 as it serves the additional purpose of a twos complement overflow indicator, a feature lacking in the 8080. Arithmetic instructions on the Z80 set it to indicate overflow rather than parity, while bitwise instructions still use it as a parity flag. (This introduces a subtle incompatibility of the Z80 with code written for the 8080, as the Z80 sometimes indicates signed overflow where the 8080 would indicate parity, possibly causing the logic of some practical 8080 software to fail on the Z80.) This new overflow flag is used for all new Z80-specific 16-bit operations (, ) as well as for 8-bit arithmetic operations, while the 16-bit operations inherited from the 8080 (, , ) do not affect it. Also, bit\u00a01 of the flags register (a spare bit on the 8080) is used as a flag\u00a0N that indicates whether the last arithmetic instruction executed was a subtraction or addition. The Z80 version of the instruction (decimal adjust accumulator for BCD arithmetic) checks the N\u00a0flag and behaves accordingly, so a (hypothetical) subtraction followed later by will yield a different result on an old 8080 than on the Z80. However, this would likely be erroneous code on the 8080, as was defined for addition only on that processor.\nThe Z80 has six new instructions that can load the DE, BC, and SP register pairs from memory, and load memory from these three register pairs\u2014unlike the 8080. As on the 8080, load instructions do not affect the flags (except for the special-purpose I and R register loads). A result of a regular encoding (common with the 8080) is that each of the 8-bit registers can be loaded from themselves (e.g. ). This is effectively a .\nNew block transfer instructions can move up to 64\u00a0kilobytes from memory to memory or between memory and I/O peripheral ports. Block instructions and (load, increment/decrement, repeat) use HL to point to the source address, DE to the destination address, and BC as a byte counter. Bytes are copied from source to destination, the pointers are incremented or decremented, and the byte counter is decremented until BC reaches zero. Non-repeating versions and move a single byte and bump the pointers and byte counter, which if it becomes zero resets the P/V\u00a0flag. Corresponding memory-to-I/O instructions , , , , , , and operate similarly, except that B, not BC, is used as the byte counter. The Z80 can input and output any register to an I/O port using register\u00a0C to designate the port. (The 8080 only performs I/O through the accumulator\u00a0A, using a direct port address specified in the instruction; a self-modifying code technique is required to use a variable 8080 port address.)\nThe last group of block instructions perform a compare operation between the byte at (HL) and the accumulator\u00a0A. Register pair DE is not used. The repeating versions and only terminate if BC goes to zero or a match is found. HL is left pointing to the byte after () or before () the matching byte. If no match is found, the Z\u00a0flag is reset. There are non-repeating versions and .\nUnlike the 8080, the Z80 can jump to a relative address ( instead of ) using a shorter instruction with a signed 8-bit displacement. There are unconditional and conditional forms of this instruction. Only the zero and carry conditions can be tested. (All 8080 jumps and calls, conditional or not, are three-byte instructions.) If jump is taken, the two-byte instructions are slower than the 8080-style three-byte instructions; if not taken, instructions are quicker.\nA two-byte instruction specialized for program looping is also new to the Z80: (decrement jump if non-zero) takes a signed 8-bit displacement as an operand. The B\u00a0register is decremented, and if the result is nonzero, then program execution jumps relative to PC; the flags remain unaltered. To perform an equivalent loop on an 8080 requires separate and conditional jump (to a two-byte absolute address) instructions (totalling four bytes), and the alters the flag register.\nThe index register (IX/IY, often abbreviated XY) instructions can be useful for accessing data organised in fixed heterogenous structures (such as records) or at fixed offsets relative a variable base address (as in recursive stack frames) and can also reduce code size by removing the need for multiple short instructions using non-indexed registers. However, although they may save speed in some contexts when compared to long/complex \"equivalent\" sequences of simpler operations, they incur a lot of additional CPU time (e.g., 19 T-states to access one indexed memory location vs. as little as 11 to access the same memory using HL and to point to the next). Thus, for simple or linear accesses of data, use of IX and IY tend to be slower and occupy more memory. Still, they may be useful in cases where the \"main\" registers are all occupied, by removing the need to save/restore registers. Their officially undocumented 8-bit halves (see below) can be especially useful in this context, for they incur less slowdown than their 16-bit parents. Similarly, instructions for 16-bit additions are not particularly fast (11\u00a0clocks) in the original Z80 (being 1\u00a0clock slower than in the 8080/8085); nonetheless, they are about twice as fast as performing the same calculations using 8-bit operations, and equally important, they reduce register usage. It was not uncommon for programmers to \"poke\" different offset displacement bytes (which were typically calculated dynamically) into indexed instructions; this is an example of self-modifying code, which was regular practice on nearly all early 8-bit processors with non-pipelined execution units.\nThe index registers have a parallel instruction to , which is and . This is often seen in stack-oriented languages like Forth, which at the end of every Forth word (atomic subroutines comprising the language) must jump unconditionally back to their thread interpreter routines. Typically this jump instruction appears hundreds of times in an application, and using rather than saves a byte and two T-states for each occurrence. This naturally makes the index register unavailable for any other use, or else the need to constantly reload it would negate its efficiency.\nThe 10-year-newer microcoded Z180 design could initially afford more \"chip area\", permitting a slightly more efficient implementation (using a wider ALU, among other things); similar things can be said for the Z800, Z280, and Z380. However, it was not until the fully pipelined eZ80 was launched in 2001 that those instructions finally became approximately as cycle-efficient as it is technically possible to make them, i.e. given the Z80 encodings combined with the capability to do an 8-bit read or write every clock cycle.\nUndocumented instructions.\nThe index registers, IX and IY, were intended as flexible 16-bit pointers, enhancing the ability to manipulate memory, stack frames and data structures. Officially, they were treated as 16-bit only. In reality they were implemented as a pair of 8-bit registers, in the same fashion as the HL register, which is accessible either as 16 bits or separately as the \"H\"igh and \"L\"ow registers. The binary opcodes (machine language) were identical, but preceded by a new opcode prefix. Zilog published the opcodes and related mnemonics for the intended functions, but did not document the fact that every opcode that allowed manipulation of the H and L registers was equally valid for the 8 bit portions of the IX and IY registers. For example, the opcode 26h followed by an immediate byte value will load that value into the H register. Preceding this two-byte instruction with the IX register's opcode prefix, DD, would instead result in the most significant 8 bits of the IX register being loaded with that same value. A notable exception to this would be instructions similar to which make use of both the HL and IX or IY registers in the same instruction; in this case the DD prefix is only applied to the (IX+d) portion of the instruction. The halves of the XY registers could also hold operands for 8-bit arithmetic, logical and compare instructions, sparing the regular 8-bit registers for other use. The undocumented ability to increment and decrement the upper half of an index register made it easy to expand the range of the normal indexed instructions, without having to resort to the documented or .\nThere are several other undocumented instructions as well. Undocumented or illegal opcodes are not detected by the Z80 and have various effects, some of which are useful. However, as they are not part of the formal definition of the instruction set, different implementations of the Z80 are not guaranteed (or especially likely) to work the same way for every undocumented opcode.\nBugs.\nThe instruction does not conform to the Z80 documentation. Both the and instructions are supposed to leave the carry (C) flag unmodified. The instruction operates correctly; however, during the execution of the instruction, the carry flag takes the results of a spurious compare between the accumulator (A) and the last output of the instruction.\nExample code.\nThe following Z80 assembly source code is for a subroutine named codice_39 that copies a block of data bytes of a given size from one location to another. The data block is copied one byte at a time, and the data movement and looping logic utilizes 16-bit operations. It demonstrates a variety of instructions but in practice it would not be coded this way as the Z80 has a single instruction that will replace this entire subroutine: codice_40. The sample code will move one byte every 46 T-states. Substituting the codice_40 instruction will move each byte in only 21 T-states. Note that the assembled code is binary-compatible with the Intel 8080 and 8085 CPUs.\nInstruction execution.\nEach instruction is executed in steps that are usually termed machine cycles (M-cycles), each of which can take between three and six clock periods (T-states). Each M-cycle corresponds roughly to one memory access or internal operation. Multiple instructions actually end during the M1 of the \"next\" instruction which is known as a \"fetch/execute overlap\".\nThe Z80 machine cycles are sequenced by an internal state machine which builds each M-cycle out of 3, 4, 5 or 6 T-states depending on context. This avoids cumbersome asynchronous logic and makes the control signals behave consistently at a wide range of clock frequencies. It also means that a higher frequency crystal must be used than without this subdivision of machine cycles (approximately 2\u20133 times higher). It does not imply tighter requirements on memory access times, since a high resolution clock allows more precise control of memory timings and so memory can be active in parallel with the CPU to a greater extent, allowing more efficient use of available memory bandwidth.\nOne central example of this is that, for opcode fetch, the Z80 combines two full clock cycles into a memory access period (the M1-signal). In the Z80 this signal lasts for a relatively larger part of the typical instruction execution time than in a design such as the 6800, 6502, or similar, where this period would typically last typically 30-40% of a clock cycle. With memory chip affordability (i.e. access times around 450-250\u00a0ns in the 1980s) typically determining the fastest possible access time, this meant that such designs were locked to a significantly longer clock cycle (i.e. lower internal clock speed) than the Z80.\nMemory was generally slow compared to the state machine sub-cycles (clock cycles) used in contemporary microprocessors. The shortest machine cycle that could safely be used in embedded designs has therefore often been limited by memory access times, not by the maximum CPU frequency (especially so during the home computer era). However, this relation has slowly changed during the last decades, particularly regarding SRAM; cacheless, single-cycle designs such as the eZ80 have therefore become much more meaningful recently.\nThe content of the refresh register R is sent out on the lower half of the address bus along with a refresh control signal while the CPU is decoding and executing the fetched instruction. During refresh the contents of the Interrupt register I are sent out on the upper half of the address bus.\nCompatible peripherals.\nZilog introduced a number of peripheral parts for the Z80, which all support the Z80's interrupt handling system and I/O address space. These include the counter/timer channel (CTC), the SIO (serial input/output), the DMA (direct memory access), the PIO (parallel input/output) and the DART (dual asynchronous receiver\u2013transmitter). As the product line developed, low-power, high-speed and CMOS versions of these chips were introduced.\nLike the 8080, 8085 and 8086 processors, but unlike processors such as the Motorola 6800 and MOS Technology 6502, the Z80 and 8080 has a separate control line and address space for I/O instructions. While some Z80-based computers such as the Osborne 1 used \"Motorola-style\" memory mapped input/output devices, usually the I/O space was used to address one of the Zilog peripheral chips compatible with the Z80. During the timing for an I/O read or an I/O write operation, a single wait cycle is automatically inserted by the Z80. Zilog I/O chips supported the Z80's new mode 2 interrupts which simplified interrupt handling for large numbers of peripherals.\nThe Z80 was officially described as supporting 16-bit (64\u00a0KB) memory addressing, and 8-bit (256 ports) I/O-addressing. All I/O instructions actually assert the entire 16-bit address bus. OUT\u00a0(C),reg and IN\u00a0reg,(C) places the contents of the entire 16-bit BC register on the address bus; OUT\u00a0(n),A and IN\u00a0A,(n) places the contents of the A\u00a0register on b8\u2013b15 of the address bus and the port address \"n\" on b0\u2013b7 of the address bus. A designer could choose to decode the entire 16-bit address bus on I/O operations in order to take advantage of this feature, or use the high half of the address bus to select subfeatures of the I/O device. This feature has also been used to minimise decoding hardware requirements, such as in the Amstrad CPC/PCW and ZX81.\nSecond sources and derivatives.\nSecond sources.\nMostek, which produced the first Z80 for Zilog, offered it second-source as MK3880. SGS-Thomson (now STMicroelectronics) was a second source, too, with their Z8400. Sharp and NEC developed second sources for the NMOS Z80, the LH0080 and \u03bcPD780C, respectively. The LH0080 was used in various home computers and personal computers made by Sharp and other Japanese manufacturers, including Sony MSX computers, and a number of computers in the Sharp MZ series. Sharp developed the LH0080A and LH0080B to operate at frequencies of 4\u00a0MHz and 6\u00a0MHz, respectively. Sharp also developed LH0083 compatible with Z80 DMA.\nToshiba made a CMOS-version, the TMPZ84C00, which is believed (but not verified) to be the same design also used by Zilog for its own CMOS Z84C00. There were also Z8400, Z80-chips made by GoldStar (now LG) and the BU18400 series of Z80-clones (including DMA, PIO, CTC, DART and SIO) in NMOS and CMOS made by ROHM Electronics. The LH5080, LH5081, and LH5082, which are CMOS versions of the Z80, PIO, and CTC respectively, are manufactured by Sharp.\nIn East Germany, an unlicensed clone of the Z80, known as the U880, was manufactured. It was used extensively in Robotron's and VEB Mikroelektronik M\u00fchlhausen's computer systems (such as the KC85-series) and also in multiple self-made computer systems. In Romania another unlicensed clone could be found, named MMN80CPU and produced by Microelectronica, used in home computers like TIM-S, HC, COBRA.\nAlso, several clones of Z80 were created in the Soviet Union, notable ones being the T34BM1, also called \u041a\u04201858\u0412\u041c1 (parallelling the Soviet 8080-clone KR580VM80A). The first marking was used in pre-production series, while the second had to be used for a larger production. Though, due to the collapse of Soviet microelectronics in the late 1980s, there are more T34BM1s than \u041a\u04201858\u0412\u041c1s.\nNotable uses.\nDesktop computers.\nDuring the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Z80 was used in a great number of fairly anonymous business-oriented machines with the CP/M operating system, a combination that dominated the market at the time. Four well-known examples of Z80 business computers running CP/M are the Heathkit H89, the portable Osborne 1, the Kaypro series, and the Epson QX-10. Less well-known was the expensive high-end Otrona Attache. Some systems used multi-tasking operating system software (like MP/M or Morrow's Micronix) to share the one processor between several concurrent users.\nMultiple home computers were introduced that used the Z80 as the main processor or as a plug-in option to allow access to software written for the Z80. Notable are the TRS-80 series, including the original model (later retronymed \"Model I\"), Model II, Model III, and Model 4, which were equipped with a Z80 as their main processor, and some (but not all) other TRS-80 models which used the Z80 as either the main or a secondary processor. Other notable machines were the DEC Rainbow 100, and the Seequa Chameleon, both of which featured both an Intel 8088 and a Z80 CPU, to support either 8-bit CP/M-80 applications running on the Z80, or a custom MS-DOS that was not fully compatible with PC DOS applications running on the 8088.\nIn 1981, Multitech (later to become Acer) introduced the Microprofessor I, a simple and inexpensive training system for the Z80 microprocessor. Currently, it is still manufactured and sold by Flite Electronics International Limited in Southampton, England.\nIn 1984 Toshiba introduced the Toshiba MSX HX-10 in Japan and Australia.\nIn 1985, Sharp introduced the Hotbit and Gradiente introduced the Expert, which became the dominant 8-bit home computers in Brazil until the late 1980s.\nPortable and handheld computers.\nUse of the Z80 in lighter, battery-operated devices became more widespread with the availability of CMOS versions of the processor. It also inspired the development of other CMOS based processors, such as the LH5801 from Sharp. The Sharp PC-1500, a BASIC-programmable pocket computer was released in 1981, followed by the improved Sharp PC-1600 in 1986 and the Sharp PC-E220 in 1991. Later models of the Sharp Wizard series of personal organizers also were Z80 based. Laptops which could run the CP/M operating system just like the desktop machines followed with Epson PX-8 Geneva in 1984, and in 1985 the Epson PX-4 and Bondwell-2. While the laptop market in subsequent years moved to more powerful Intel 8086 processors and the MS-DOS operating system, light-weight Z80-based systems with a longer battery life were still being introduced, such as the Cambridge Z88 in 1988 and the Amstrad NC100 in 1992. The Z80-derived Z8S180 also found its way into an early pen-operated personal digital assistant, the Amstrad PenPad PDA600 in 1993. Hong Kong-based VTech produced a line of small laptop computers called \"Lasers\" based on a Z80. The last two were the Laser PC5 and PC6.\nThe Cidco MailStation Mivo 100, first released in 1999, was a stand-alone portable email device, with a Z80-based microcontroller. Texas Instruments produced a line of pocket organizers (ending in 2000) using Toshiba processors built around a Z80 core; the first of these was the TI PS-6200 and after a lengthy production run of some dozen models culminated in their PocketMate series.\nEmbedded systems and consumer electronics.\nThe Zilog Z80 has long been a popular microprocessor in embedded systems and microcontroller cores, where it remains in widespread use today. Applications of the Z80 include uses in consumer electronics, industrial products, and electronic musical instruments. For example, Z80 was used in the groundbreaking music synthesizer Prophet-5, as well as in the first MIDI-equipped synthesizer, the Prophet 600. The Z80 was the basis for all E-mu Systems instruments from 1976 to 1986. Casio used the Z80A in its PV-1000 video game console.\nMany early-1980s arcade video games, including the arcade game Pac-Man, contain Z80 CPUs.\nThe Z80 was used in Sega's Master System and Game Gear consoles. The Sega Genesis contains a Z80, with its own 8\u00a0KB of RAM, which runs in parallel with the MC68000 main CPU, has direct access to the system's sound chips and I/O (controller) ports, and has a switched data path to the main memory bus of the 68000 (providing access to the 64\u00a0KB main RAM, the software cartridge, and the whole video chip); in addition to providing backward compatibility with Master System games, the Z80 is often used to control and play back audio in Genesis software.\nZ80 CPUs were also used in the popular TI-8x series of graphing calculators from Texas Instruments, beginning in 1990 with the TI-81, which features a Z80 clocked at 2\u00a0MHz. Most higher-line calculators in the series, starting with the TI-82 and TI-85, clock their Z80 CPUs at 6\u00a0MHz or higher. (A few models with TI-8x names use other CPUs, such as the M68000, but the vast majority are Z80-based. On those, it is possible to run assembled or compiled user programs in the form of Z80 machine-language code.) \nTI-83 and TI-84 Plus model graphing calculators uses the Z80 while the TI-84 Plus CE series use the eZ80; all three calculator series are still sold by Texas Instruments as of 2025.\nIn the late 1980s, a series of Soviet landline phones called \"AON\" featured the Z80; these phones expanded the feature set of the landline with caller ID, different ringtones based on the caller, speed dial and so forth. In the second half of the 1990s however, manufacturers of these phones switched to 8051 compatible MCUs to reduce power consumption, and prevent compact wall power adapters from overheating.\nDiscontinuation.\nOn April 15, 2024, Zilog announced the discontinuation of the Z80 processor, with orders being accepted until June 14, 2024. The announcement included 13 variants of the Z80 processor, some of which were DIP40 variants of the chip. Zilog will continue to manufacture the upgraded eZ80 version of the processor.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSimulators / Emulators:"}

(later to be better known as Sinclair Research). It was one of the first computers available in the United Kingdom for less than a hundred pounds. It was available in kit form for \u00a379.95, where purchasers had to assemble and solder it together, and as a ready-built version at \u00a399.95.\nThe ZX80 was advertised as the first personal computer for under \u00a3100 and received praise for its value and documentation. However, it faced criticism for screen blanking during program execution, small RAM size, and the keyboard design. It was very popular straight away, and for some time there was a waiting list of several months for either version of the machine.\nName.\nThe ZX80 was named after the Z80 processor with the 'X' meaning \"the mystery ingredient\".\nHardware.\nInternally, the machine was designed by Jim Westwood around a Z80 central processing unit with a clock speed of 3.25\u00a0MHz, and is equipped with 1\u00a0KB of static RAM and 4\u00a0KB of read-only memory (ROM). It has no sound output.\nThe ZX80 is designed around readily available TTL ICs, without any custom chips; the only proprietary technology is the firmware.\nThe machine is mounted in a small white plastic case, with a one-piece blue membrane keyboard on the front. There were problems with durability, reliability and overheating (despite appearances, the black stripes visible on the top rear of the case are merely cosmetic, and are not ventilation slots).\nVideo output is black-and-white, character-based. However, the ZX80 character set includes some simple block-based graphics glyphs, allowing basic graphics to be accomplished, with some effort. One advantage to using monochrome video is that different colour broadcast standards (e.g. PAL, SECAM) simply were not an issue when the system was sold outside the UK. The NTSC standard was different enough that it required a hardware change (including an extra diode).\nDisplay was over an RF connection to a household television, and simple offline program storage was possible using a cassette recorder. The video display generator of the ZX80 used minimal hardware plus a combination of software to generate a video signal. (Some say this was an idea popularised by Don Lancaster in his 1978 book \"The TV Cheap Video Cookbook\" and his \"TV Typewriter\". However, that design does not involve a microprocessor for video generation, and is not similar to the ZX80 in other aspects either. The ZX80 and ZX81 also employ very specific traits of the Z80 processor.)\nUnlike the later follow up, ZX81, the ZX80 can only generate a picture when it is idle, i.e. waiting for a key to be pressed. When running a BASIC program, or when pressing a key during editing, the TV display therefore blanks out (loses synchronisation) momentarily while the processor is busy. So a BASIC program has to introduce a pause for input to display the next change in graphical output, making smooth moving graphics impossible. This can be overcome only by very clever machine code tricks. These effectively have to replace the video rountines in ROM and embed the same in the normal program logic with exact timing, which is extremely cumbersome. However, a few such games were developed by skilled users or programmers later on.\nFirmware.\nThe 4\u00a0KB ROM contains the Sinclair BASIC programming language, editor, and operating system. BASIC commands are not entered by typing them out but are instead selected somewhat similarly to a programmable graphing calculator \u2013 each key has a few different functions selected by both context and modes as well as with the shift key.\nExpansion.\nOther than the built-in cassette and video ports, the only provided means of expansion is a slot opening at the rear of the case, which exposes an expansion bus edge connector on the motherboard. The same slot bus was continued on the ZX81, and later the ZX Spectrum, which encouraged a small cottage industry of expansion devices, including memory packs, printers and even floppy drives. The original Sinclair ZX80 RAM Pack holds either 1, 2 or 3\u00a0KB of static RAM and a later model holds 16\u00a0KB of dynamic RAM (DRAM). With software, the computer can use up to 48\u00a0KB of memory.\nFollowing the ZX81's release, a ZX81 8\u00a0KB ROM was released to upgrade the ZX80 at a cost of around 20% of a real ZX81. It comes with a thin keyboard overlay and a ZX81 manual. By simply taking off the top cover of the ZX80 and prying the old ROM from its socket and carefully inserting the new ROM and adding the keyboard overlay, the ZX80 functions almost identically to the proper ZX81 \u2013 except for SLOW mode, due to the differences in hardware between the two models. The process is easily reversed to return the ZX80 to its original configuration.\nOne common modification by hobbyist users is to attach a full-size keyboard, optionally moving the motherboard into a larger case. This has the dual advantages of making the machine easier to type on, while increasing ventilation to the motherboard.\nVersions.\nThe UK version of the machine was the standard, and only changes that were absolutely necessary to sell units in other markets were made. In fact, the only real change made in most markets involved the video output frequency (the ZX80 used an external power transformer, so differences in AC line frequency and outlet were not an issue to the machine itself). One outcome of this is that the machine had some keyboard keys and characters that were distinctly British: was used instead of , instead of or , and the character set and keyboard included the pound sign (\u00a3).\nReception.\nThe ZX80 was widely advertised as the first personal computer for under \u00a3100 (US$200). \"Kilobaud Microcomputing\" liked the design of the preassembled version, and said that the screen flickering during input or output was annoying but useful as an undocumented feature, indicating the computer functioning correctly. It praised the documentation as excellent for novices, and noted that purchasing the computer was cheaper than taking a college class on BASIC. The magazine concluded, \"The ZX-80 is a real computer and an excellent value\", but only for beginners who could learn from the documentation or programmers experienced with writing Z80 software. \"BYTE\" called the ZX80 a \"remarkable device\". It praised the real-time, interactive BASIC syntax checking, and reported that the computer performed better on benchmarks than some competitors, including the TRS-80 Model I. The magazine criticised the screen blanking during program execution, small RAM size, inadequate built-in Sinclair BASIC, and keyboard, and recommended against buying the kit version given difficulty of assembly and because purchasers did not save money. \"BYTE\" concluded that \"the ZX80 might be summarized as a high-performance, very low-cost, portable personal computer system ... a good starting point\".\nSales of the ZX80 reached about 50,000, which contributed significantly to the UK leading the world in home computer ownership through the 1980s. Owing to the unsophisticated design and the tendency for the units to overheat, surviving machines in good condition are sought after and can fetch high prices by collectors.\nClones.\nThere were also clones of the ZX80, such as the MicroAce, and from Brazil the Nova Eletr\u00f4nica/Prol\u00f3gica NE-Z80 and the Microdigital TK80.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Spectrum played a pivotal role in the history of personal computers and video games, especially in the United Kingdom. It was one of the all-time bestselling British computers with over five million units sold. It was released in the UK on 23 April 1982, the United States in 1983, and Europe in 1984.\nThe machine was designed by the English entrepreneur and inventor Sir Clive Sinclair and his small team in Cambridge, and was manufactured in Dundee, Scotland by Timex Corporation. It was made to be small, simple, and most importantly inexpensive, with as few components as possible. The addendum \"Spectrum\" was chosen to highlight the machine's colour display, which differed from the black-and-white display of its predecessor, the ZX81. Rick Dickinson designed its distinctive case, rainbow motif, and rubber keyboard. Video output is transmitted to a television set rather than a dedicated monitor, while application software is loaded and saved onto compact audio cassettes.\nThe ZX Spectrum was initially distributed by mail order, but after severe backlogs it was sold through High Street chains in the United Kingdom. It was released in the US as the Timex Sinclair 2068 in 1983, and in some parts of Europe as the Timex Computer 2048. There are seven models overall, ranging from the entry level with 16\u00a0KB RAM released in 1982 to the ZX\u00a0Spectrum\u00a0+3 with 128\u00a0KB RAM and built-in floppy disk drive in 1987. The machine primarily competed with the Commodore\u00a064, BBC\u00a0Micro, Dragon\u00a032, and the Amstrad\u00a0CPC range. Over 24,000 software products were released for the ZX Spectrum.\nIts introduction led to a boom in companies producing software and hardware, the effects of which are still seen. It was among the first home computers aimed at a mainstream UK audience, with some crediting it for launching the British information technology industry. The Spectrum was Britain's top-selling computer until the Amstrad PCW surpassed it in the 1990s. It was discontinued in 1992.\nHistory.\nThe ZX Spectrum was conceived and designed by engineers at Sinclair Research, founded by English entrepreneur and inventor Clive Sinclair, who was well known for his eccentricity and pioneering ethic. On 25 July 1961, three years after passing his A-levels, he founded Sinclair Radionics to advertise his inventions and buy components. In 1972, Sinclair competed with Texas Instruments to produce the world's first pocket calculator, the Sinclair Executive. By the mid 1970s, Sinclair Radionics was producing handheld electronic calculators, miniature televisions, and the ill-fated digital Black Watch wristwatch. Due to financial losses, Sinclair sought investors from the National Enterprise Board (NEB), who had bought a 43% interest in the company and streamlined his product line. Sinclair's relationship with the NEB had worsened, and by 1979 it opted to break up Sinclair Radionics entirely, selling off its television division to Binatone and its calculator division to ESL Bristol.\nAfter incurring a \u00a37 million investment loss, Sinclair was given a golden handshake and an estimated \u00a310,000 severance package. He had a former employee, Christopher Curry, establish a \"corporate lifeboat\" company named Science of Cambridge Ltd, in July 1977, called such as they were located near the University of Cambridge. By this time inexpensive microprocessors had started appearing on the market, which prompted Sinclair to start producing the MK14, a computer teaching kit which sold well at a very low price. Encouraged by this success, Sinclair renamed his company to Sinclair Research, and started looking to manufacture personal computers. Keeping the cost low was essential for Sinclair to avoid his products from becoming outpriced by American or Japanese equivalents as had happened to several of the previous Sinclair Radionics products. On 29 January 1980, the ZX80 home computer was launched to immediate popularity; notable for being one of the first computers available in the United Kingdom for less than \u00a3100. The company conducted no market research whatsoever prior to the launch of the ZX80; according to Sinclair, he \"simply had a hunch\" that the public was sufficiently interested to make such a project feasible and went ahead with ordering 100,000 sets of parts so that he could launch at high volume.\nOn 5 March 1981, the ZX81 was launched worldwide to immense success with more than 1.5 million units sold, 60% of which was outside Britain. According to Ben Rosen, by pricing the ZX81 so low, the company had \"opened up a completely new market among people who had never previously considered owning a computer\". After its release, computing in Britain became an activity for the general public rather than the preserve of office workers and hobbyists. The ZX81's commercial success made Sinclair Research one of Britain's leading computer manufacturers, with Sinclair himself reportedly \"amused and gratified\" by the attention the machine received.\nDevelopment.\nDevelopment of the ZX Spectrum began in September 1981, a few months after the release of the ZX81. Sinclair resolved to make his own products obsolete before his rivals developed the products that would do so. Parts of designs from the ZX80 and ZX81 were reused to ensure a speedy and cost-effective manufacturing process. The team consisted of 20 engineers housed in a small office at 6 King's Parade, Cambridge. During early production, the machine was known as the ZX81 Colour or the ZX82 to highlight the machine's colour display, which differed from the black and white of its predecessors. The addendum \"Spectrum\" was added later on, to emphasise its 15-colour palette. Aside from a new crystal oscillator and extra chips to add additional kilobytes of memory, the ZX Spectrum was intended to be, as quoted by Sinclair's marketing manager, essentially a \"ZX81 with colour\". According to Sinclair, the team also wanted to combine the ZX81's separate random-access memory sections for audio and video into a single bank.\nChief engineer Richard Altwasser was responsible for the ZX Spectrum's hardware design. His main contribution was the design of the semi-custom uncommitted logic array (ULA) integrated circuit, which integrated, on a single chip, the essential hardware functions. Altwasser designed a graphics mode that required less than 7 kilobytes of memory and implemented it on the ULA. Vickers wrote most of the ROM code. Lengthy discussions between Altwasser and Sinclair engineers resulted in a broad agreement that the ZX Spectrum must have high-resolution graphics, 16 kilobytes of memory, an improved cassette interface, and an impressive colour palette. To achieve this, the team had to divorce the central processing unit (CPU) away from the main display to enable it to work at full efficiency \u2013 a method which contrasted with the ZX81's integrated CPU. The inclusion of colour proved a major obstacle to the engineers. A Teletext-like approach was briefly considered, in which each line of text would have colour-change codes inserted into it. This was deemed unsuitable for high-resolution graphs or diagrams that involved multiple colour changes. Altwasser devised the idea of allocating a colour attribute to each character position on the screen. This ultimately used eight bits of memory for each character position; three bits to provide any one of eight foreground colours and three bits for the eight background colours, one bit for extra brightness and one bit for flashing. Overall, the system took up slightly less than 7 kilobytes of memory, leaving an additional 9 kilobytes to write programs\u00a0\u2013 a figure that pleased the team.\nMuch of the firmware was written by computer scientist Steve Vickers from Nine Tiles, who compiled all control routines to produce the Sinclair BASIC interpreter, a custom variant of the general purpose BASIC programming language. Making a custom interpreter made it possible to fit all of its functionality into a very small amount of read-only memory (ROM). The development process of the software was marked by disagreements between Nine Tiles and Sinclair Research. Sinclair placed an emphasis on expediting the release of the Spectrum, primarily by minimising alterations in the software from the ZX81, which had in turn been based on the ZX80's software. The software architecture of the ZX80, however, had been tailored for a severely constrained memory system, and in Nine Tiles' opinion was unsuitable for the enhanced processing demands of the ZX Spectrum. Sinclair favoured solving this with expansion modules on the existing framework like with the ZX81, which Nine Tiles disagreed with. Ultimately, both designs were developed, but Vickers and Nine Tiles were unable to finish their version before the launch of the Spectrum and it was not used.\nThe distinctive case and colourful design of the ZX Spectrum was the creation of Rick Dickinson, a young British industrial designer who had been hired by Sinclair to design the ZX81. Dickinson was tasked to design a sleeker and more \"marketable\" appearance to the new machine, whilst ensuring all 192 BASIC functions could fit onto 40 physical keys. Early sketches from August 1981 showed the case was to be more angular and wedge-like, in similar vein to an upgraded ZX81 model. Dickinson later settled on a flatter design with a raised rear section and rounded sides in order to depict the machine as \"more advanced\" as opposed to a mere upgrade. In drawing up potential logos, Dickinson proposed a series of different logotypes which all featured rainbow slashes across the keyboard.\nThe design of the Spectrum's rubber keyboard was simplified from several hundred components to a conventional moving keyboard down to \"four to five\" moving parts using a new technology. The keyboard was still undergoing changes as late as February 1982; some sketches included a roundel-on-square key design which was later featured on the later Spectrum+ model. Dickinson recalled in 2007 that \"everything was cost driven\" and that the minimalist, Bauhaus approach to the Spectrum gave it an elegant yet \"[non] revolutionary\" form. The drawing board on which Dickinson designed the ZX Spectrum is now on display in the Science Museum in London.\nThe need for an improved cassette interface was apparent from ZX81 users who encountered problems trying to save and load programs. To increase the data transfer speed, the team decreased the length of tones that represent binary data. Originally, the team aimed for 1000 baud, but succeeded in reaching a considerably faster 1500 baud. To increase reliability, a leading period of constant tone was introduced, allowing the cassette recorder's automatic gain control to settle down, eliminating hisses on the tape. A Schmitt trigger was added inside the ULA to reduce noise of the received signal. Unlike the ZX81, the Spectrum is able to maintain its display during data transfer, allowing programs to show a splash screen whilst loading.\nAs with the ZX81, the ZX Spectrum was manufactured in Dundee, Scotland, by Timex Corporation at the Dryburgh factory. Prior to the ZX81, Timex was an established manufacturer of mechanical watches, but had little experience in assembling electronics. Timex's director, Fred Olsen, determined that the company would diversify into other areas and signed a contract with Sinclair.\nLaunch.\nThe ZX Spectrum was officially revealed before journalists by Sinclair at the Churchill Hotel in Marylebone, London, on 23 April 1982. Later that week, the machine was presented in a \"blaze of publicity\" at the Earl's Court Computer Show in London, and the ZX Microfair in Manchester. The ZX Spectrum was launched with two models: a 16KB 'basic' version, and an enhanced 48KB variant. The former model had an undercutting price of \u00a3125, significantly lower than its main competitor the BBC Micro, whilst the latter model's price of \u00a3175 was comparable to a third of an Apple II computer. Upon release, the keyboard surprised many users due to its use of rubber keys, described as offering the feel of \"dead flesh\". Sinclair himself remarked that the keyboard's rubber mould was \"unusual\", but consumers were undeterred.\nDespite very high demand, Sinclair Research was \"notoriously late\" in delivering the ZX Spectrum. Their practice of offering mail-order sales before units were ready ensured a constant cash flow, but meant a lacking distribution. Nigel Searle, the newly-appointed chief of Sinclair's computer division, said in June 1982 the company had no plans to stock the new machine in WHSmith, which was at the time Sinclair's only retailer. Searle explained that the mail-order system was in place due to there being no \"obvious\" retail outlets in the United Kingdom which could sell personal computers, and it made \"better sense\" financially to continue selling through mail-order. The company's conservative approach to distributing the machine was criticised, with disillusioned customers telephoning and writing letters. Demand sky-rocketed beyond Sinclair's planned 20,000 monthly unit output to a backlog of 30,000 orders by July 1982. Due to a scheduled holiday at the Timex factory that summer, the backlog had risen to 40,000 units. Sinclair issued a public apology in September that year, and promised that the backlog would be cleared by the end of that month. Supply did not return to normal until the 1982 Christmas season.\nProduction of the machine rapidly increased with the arrival of the less expensive Issue 2 motherboard, a redesign of the main circuit board which addressed hardware manufacturing defects that affected production of the first model. Sales of the ZX Spectrum reached 200,000 in its first nine months, rising to 300,000 for the whole of the first year. By August 1983 total sales in Britain and Europe had exceeded 500,000, with the millionth Spectrum manufactured on 9 December 1983. By this point, an average of 50,000 units were being purchased each month.\nIn July 1983, an enhanced version of the ZX Spectrum was launched in the United States as the Timex Sinclair 2068. Advertisements described it as having 72 kilobytes of memory and a full range of colour and sound for under $200. Despite the improvements upon its British counterpart, sales were poor and Timex Sinclair collapsed the following year.\nSuccess and market domination.\nA crucial part of the company's marketing strategy was to implement regular price-cutting at strategic intervals to maintain market share. Ian Adamson and Richard Kennedy noted that Sinclair's method was driven by securing his leading position through \"panicking\" the competition. While most companies at the time reduced prices of their products while their market share was dwindling, Sinclair Research discounted theirs shortly after sales had peaked, throwing the competition into \"utter disarray\". Sinclair Research made a profit of \u00a314 million in 1983, compared to \u00a38.5 million the previous year. Turnover doubled from \u00a327.2 million to \u00a354.5 million, which equated to roughly \u00a31 million for each person employed directly by the company.\nClive Sinclair became a focal point during the ZX Spectrum's marketing campaign by putting a human face onto the business. Sinclair Research was portrayed in the media as a \"plucky\" British challenger taking on the technical and marketing might of giant American and Japanese corporations. As David O'Reilly noted in 1986, \"by astute use of public relations, particularly playing up his image of a Briton taking on the world, Sinclair has become the best-known name in micros.\" The media latched onto Sinclair's image; his \"Uncle Clive\" persona is said to have been created by the gossip columnist for \"Personal Computer World\". The press praised Sinclair as a visionary genius, with \"The Sun\" lauding him as \"the most prodigious inventor since Leonardo da Vinci\". Adamson and Kennedy wrote that Sinclair outgrew the role of microcomputer manufacturer and \"accepted the mantle of pioneering boffin leading Britain into a technological utopia\". Sinclair's contribution to the technology sector resulted in him being knighted upon the recommendation of Margaret Thatcher in the Queen's 1983 Birthday Honours List.\nThe United Kingdom was largely immunised from the effects of the video game crash of 1983, due to the saturation of home computers such as the ZX Spectrum. The microcomputer market continued to grow and game development was unhindered despite the turbulence in the American markets. Computer games remained the dominant sector of the British home video game market up until they were surpassed by Sega and Nintendo consoles in 1991. By the end of 1983 there were more than 450 companies in Britain selling video games on cassette, compared to 95 the year before. An estimated 10,000 to 50,000 people, mostly young men, were developing games out of their homes based on advertisements in popular magazines. The growth of video games during this period has been compared to the punk subculture, fuelled by young people making money from their games.\nBy the mid 1980s, Sinclair Research's share of the British home computer market had climbed to a high of 40 per cent. Sales in the 1984 Christmas season were described as \"extremely good\". In early 1985 the British press reported the home computer boom to have ended, leaving many companies slashing prices of their hardware to anticipate lower sales. Despite this, celebration of Sinclair's success in the computing market continued at the \"Which Computer?\" show in Birmingham, where the five-millionth Sinclair machine (a gold coloured QL) was issued as a prize.\nLater years and company decline.\nThe ZX Spectrum's successor, the Sinclair QL, was officially announced on 12 January 1984, shortly before the Macintosh 128K went on sale. Contrasting with its predecessors, the QL was aimed at more serious, professional home users. Fully operational QLs were not available until the late summer, and complaints against Sinclair concerning delays were upheld by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) in May of that year. Particularly serious were allegations that Sinclair was cashing cheques months before machines were shipped. By autumn 1984, Sinclair was still publicly forecasting that it would be a \"million seller\" and that 250,000 units would be sold by the end of the year. QL production was suspended in February 1985, and the price was halved by the end of the year.&lt;ref name=\"Timex/Sinclair history\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It ultimately flopped, with 139,454 units being manufactured.\nThe ZX Spectrum+, a rebranded ZX Spectrum with identical technical specifications except for the QL-like keyboard, was introduced in October 1984 and made available in WHSmith's stores the day after its launch. Retailers stocked the device in high quantities, anticipating robust Christmas sales. It did not perform as well as projected, leading to a significant drop in Sinclair's income from orders in January, as retailers were left with surplus stock. An upgraded model, the ZX Spectrum 128, was released in Spain in September 1985, financed by the Spanish distributor Investr\u00f3nica. The UK launch was postponed until January 1986 due to the substantial leftover inventory of the prior model.\nWhile the Sinclair QL was in development, Sinclair also hoped to repeat his success with the Spectrum in the fledgling electric vehicle market, which he saw as ripe for a new approach. On 10 January 1985, Sinclair unveiled the Sinclair C5, a small one-person battery electric recumbent tricycle. It marked the culmination of Sir Clive's long-running interest in electric vehicles. The C5 turned out to be a significant commercial failure, selling only 17,000 units and losing Sinclair \u00a37 million. It has since been described as \"one of the great marketing bombs of postwar British industry\". The ASA ordered Sinclair to withdraw advertisements for the C5 after finding that the company's claims about its safety could not be justified.\nThe combined failures of the C5 and QL caused investors to lose confidence in Sinclair's judgement. In May 1985, Sinclair Research announced their intention to raise an additional \u00a310 to \u00a315 million to restructure the organisation, but securing the funds proved challenging. In June 1985, business magnate Robert Maxwell disclosed a takeover bid for Sinclair Research through Hollis Brothers, a subsidiary of his Pergamon Press. However, the deal was terminated in August 1985. On 7 April 1986 the company sold their entire computer product range, along with the \"Sinclair\" brand name, to Alan Sugar's Amstrad for \u00a35 million. The takeover sent ripples through the London Stock Exchange, but Amstrad's shares soon recovered, with one stock broker affirming that \"the City appears to have taken the news in its stride\". Amstrad's acquisition saw the release of three improved ZX Spectrum models throughout the late 1980s.\nBy 1990, Sinclair Research consisted of Sinclair and two other employees down from 130 employees at its peak in 1985. The ZX Spectrum was officially discontinued in 1992, after ten years on the market.\nHardware.\nThe central processing unit is a Zilog Z80, an 8-bit microprocessor, with a clock rate of 3.5\u00a0MHz. The original model Spectrum has 16\u00a0KB of ROM and either 16\u00a0KB or 48\u00a0KB of RAM.\nGraphics.\nVideo output is channelled through an RF modulator, intended for use with contemporary television sets. Text is displayed using a grid of 32\u00a0columns \u00d7 24\u00a0rows of characters from the ZX Spectrum character set, or from a custom set. There is a colour palette of 15 colours: seven saturated colours at two levels of brightness and black. The image resolution is pixels, subject to the same colour limitations. Colour is stored separately from the pixel bitmap in a grid corresponding to the character cells. This means that all pixels within an character block share one foreground colour and one background colour. Altwasser received a patent for this design.\nAn \"attribute\" consists of a foreground and a background colour, a brightness level (normal or bright) and a flashing \"flag\" which causes the two colours to swap at regular intervals. This scheme leads to what is dubbed attribute clash, where a desired colour of a specific pixel cannot be selected, but only the colour attributes of an block. This became a distinctive feature of the Spectrum, requiring games and other programs to be designed with this limitation in mind. Other machines, such as the Amstrad CPC and Commodore 64, do not suffer from this limitation. While the C64 also uses colour attributes, it has a special multicolour mode and hardware sprites which do not involve attribute clash.\nSound.\nSound is produced through a single-channel beeper capable of generating ten octaves. Sounds are generated by toggling a single bit on and off. From BASIC, the BEEP command plays sounds of specified pitch and duration. The processor is occupied exclusively with BEEP until the sound completes, limiting concurrent operations. Despite these constraints, it was a significant step forward from the silence of the ZX81. Programmers devised workarounds and explored unconventional methods such as programming the beeper to emit multiple pitches.\nLater software allows for two-channel sound playback. The machine includes an expansion bus edge connector and 3.5\u00a0mm audio in/out ports, for connecting a cassette recorder to load and save programs and data. The EAR port has a higher output than the MIC and is recommended for headphones, while the MIC port is intended for attachment to other audio devices as a line-in source.\nFirmware.\nThe machine's Sinclair BASIC interpreter is stored in 16\u00a0KiB ROM, along with essential system routines. The ROM code, responsible for tasks such as floating point calculations and expression parsing, exhibited significant similarities to ZX81, although a few outdated routines remained in the Spectrum ROM. The Spectrum's keyboard is imprinted with BASIC keywords. To input a command in BASIC, many keywords require a single keyboard stroke. Other keywords require a change of keyboard mode by a few keystrokes.\nThe BASIC interpreter is derived from the one used on the ZX81. A BASIC program for ZX81 can be entered into a ZX Spectrum with minimal modifications. However, Spectrum BASIC introduced numerous additional features, enhancing its usability. The ZX Spectrum character set was expanded compared to that of the ZX81, which lacked lowercase letters. Spectrum BASIC incorporated extra keywords for better graphics and sound functionality, and support for multi-statement lines was added. The built-in ROM tape modulation software routines for cassette data storage enable data transfers at an average speed of 171 bytes per second, with a theoretical peak speed of 256 bytes/s. The tape modulation is significantly more advanced than the ZX81, with approximately four times faster average speeds.\nSinclair Research models.\nZX Spectrum.\nThe original ZX Spectrum is remembered for its rubber chiclet keyboard, diminutive size and distinctive rainbow motif. It was originally released on 23 April 1982 with 16\u00a0KB of RAM for ) or with 48\u00a0KB for ); these prices were reduced to ) and ) respectively in 1983. Owners of the 16\u00a0KB model could purchase an internal 32\u00a0KB RAM upgrade, which for early \"Issue 1\" machines consisted of a daughterboard. Later issue machines required the fitting of 8 dynamic RAM chips and a few TTL chips. Users could mail their 16K Spectrums to Sinclair to be upgraded to 48\u00a0KB versions. Later revisions contained 64\u00a0KB of memory but were configured such that only 48\u00a0KB were usable. External 32\u00a0KB RAM packs that mounted in the rear expansion slot were available from third parties. Both machines had 16\u00a0KB of onboard ROM.\nAn \"Issue 1\" ZX Spectrum can be distinguished from Issue 2 or 3 models by the colour of the keys \u2013 light grey for Issue 1, blue-grey for later machines. Although the official service manual states that approximately 26,000 of these original boards were manufactured, subsequent serial number analysis shows that only 16,000 were produced, almost all of which fell in the serial number range 001-000001 to 001-016000. An online tool now exists to allow users to ascertain the likely issue number of their ZX Spectrum by inputting the serial number.\nThese models experienced numerous changes to its motherboard design throughout its life; mainly to improve manufacturing efficiencies, but also to correct bugs from previous boards. Another issue was with the Spectrum's power supply. In March 1983, Sinclair issued an urgent recall warning for all owners of models bought after 1 January 1983. Plugs with a non-textured surface were at risk of causing shock, and were asked to be sent back to a warehouse in Cambridgeshire which would supply a replacement within 48 hours.\nZX Spectrum+.\nDevelopment of the \"ZX Spectrum+\" began in June 1984, and was released on 15 October that year at \u00a3179. It was assembled by AB Electronics in South Wales and Samsung in South Korea. This 48 KB Spectrum introduced a new QL-style case with an injection-moulded keyboard and a reset button that functions as a switch shorting across the CPU reset capacitor. Electronically, it was identical to the previous 48\u00a0KB model. The machine outsold the rubber-key model two to one, however, some retailers reported a failure rate of up to 30%, compared with a more typical 5\u20136% for the older model. In early 1985, the original Spectrum was officially discontinued, and the ZX Spectrum+ was reduced in price to \u00a3129.\nZX Spectrum 128.\nIn 1985, Sinclair developed the ZX Spectrum 128 (codenamed \"Derby\") in conjunction with their Spanish distributor Investr\u00f3nica (a subsidiary of El Corte Ingl\u00e9s department store group). Investr\u00f3nica had helped adapt the ZX Spectrum+ to the Spanish market after their government introduced a special tax on all computers with 64\u00a0KB RAM or less, and a law which obliged all computers sold in Spain to support the Spanish alphabet and show messages in Spanish.\nThe appearance of the ZX Spectrum 128 is similar to the ZX Spectrum+, with the addition of a large external heatsink for the internal 7805 voltage regulator to the right-hand end of the case, replacing the internal heatsink in previous versions. This external heatsink led to the system's nickname, \"The Toast Rack\". New features included 128\u00a0KB RAM with RAM disc commands, three-channel audio via the AY-3-8912 chip, MIDI compatibility, an RS-232 serial port, an RGB monitor port, 32\u00a0KB of ROM including an improved BASIC editor, and an external keypad.\nThe machine was simultaneously unveiled for the first time and launched in September 1985 at the SIMO '85 trade show in Spain, with a price of 44,250 pesetas. Sinclair later presented the ZX Spectrum 128 at The May Fair Hotel's Crystal Rooms in London, where he acknowledged that entertainment was the most common use of home computers. Due to the large number of unsold Spectrum+ models, Sinclair decided not to start it selling in the United Kingdom until January 1986 at a price of \u00a3179.\nThe Zilog Z80 processor used in the Spectrum has a 16-bit address bus, which means only 64\u00a0KB of memory can be directly addressed. To facilitate the extra 80\u00a0KB of RAM the designers used bank switching so the new memory would be available as eight pages of 16\u00a0KB at the top of the address space. The same technique was used to page between the new 16\u00a0KB editor ROM and the original 16\u00a0KB BASIC ROM at the bottom of the address space.\nThe new sound chip and MIDI out abilities were exposed to the BASIC programming language with the command codice_1 and a new command codice_2 was added to switch the machine into 48K mode, keeping the current BASIC program intact (although there is no command to switch back to 128K mode). To enable BASIC programmers to access the additional memory, a RAM disk was created where files could be stored in the additional 80\u00a0KB of RAM. The new commands took the place of two existing user-defined-character spaces causing compatibility problems with certain BASIC programs. Unlike its predecessors, it has no internal speaker, and can only produce sound from a television speaker.\nAmstrad models.\nZX Spectrum +2.\nThe ZX Spectrum +2 marked Amstrad's entry into the Spectrum market shortly after their acquisition of the Spectrum range and \"Sinclair\" brand in 1986. It has a grey case with a spring-loaded keyboard, dual joystick ports, and an integrated cassette recorder known as the \"Datacorder\" (akin to the Amstrad CPC 464). The boot-up message reads \"\u00a9 1986 Amstrad\". It is largely identical to the ZX Spectrum 128 in most technical aspects. The machine retailed for \u00a3149.\nThe new keyboard does not have the BASIC keyword markings of earlier Spectrums, except for codice_3, codice_4, and codice_5 markings. Instead, the +2 has a menu system, almost identical to that of the ZX Spectrum 128, allowing users to switch between 48K BASIC programming with keywords and 128K BASIC programming, where all words, both keywords and others, need to be typed out in full. Despite these changes, the layout remained identical to that of the 128.\nZX Spectrum +3.\nThe ZX Spectrum +3, launched in 1987, replaces replaces the cassette drive with a built-in 3-inch floppy disk. Initially \u00a3249, it later retailed for \u00a3199. It is the only Spectrum model capable of running the CP/M operating system without additional hardware. Unlike its predecessors, the ZX Spectrum +3 power supply uses a DIN connector.\nSignificant alterations caused a series of incompatibilities. The removal of several lines on the expansion bus edge connector caused complications for some peripherals. Additionally, changes in memory timing led to certain RAM banks being contended, causing failures in high-speed colour-changing effects. The keypad scanning routines from the ROM were also eliminated, so some older 48K and 128K games no longer worked. The ZX Interface 1 was also incompatible because of disparities in ROM and expansion connectors, making it impossible to connect and use the Microdrive units.\nProduction of the +3 was discontinued in December 1990, reportedly in response to Amstrad's relaunch of their CPC range, with an estimated 15% of ZX Spectrums sold being +3 models at the time. The +2B model, the only other model still in production at this point, continued to be manufactured, as it was believed not to be in direct competition with other computers in Amstrad's product range.\nZX Spectrum +2A, +2B and +3B.\nThe ZX Spectrum +2A was a new version of the Spectrum +2 using the same circuit board as the Spectrum +3. It was sold from late 1988 and unlike the original grey +2 is housed in a black case. The Spectrum +2A/+3 motherboard (AMSTRAD part number Z70830) was designed so that it could be assembled with a +2 style \"datacorder\" connected instead of the floppy disk controller. The power supply of the ZX Spectrum +2A uses the same pinout as the +3.\nThe ZX Spectrum +2B and ZX Spectrum +3B were released in 1989. They are functionally similar in design to the Spectrum +2A and +3, though changes to the generation of the audio output signal were made to resolve problems with clipping. The +2B board has no provision for floppy disk controller circuitry, while the +3B motherboard has no provision for connecting an internal tape drive. \nProduction of all Amstrad Spectrum models ended in 1992.\nLicences and clones.\nOfficial licences.\nSinclair Research granted a licence for the ZX Spectrum design to the Timex Corporation in the United States. Timex marketed several computer models under the Timex Sinclair brand. They introduced an enhanced variant of the original Spectrum in the US, known as the Timex Sinclair 2068. This upgraded model features improvements in sound, graphics, and various other aspects. However, Timex's versions were generally not compatible with Sinclair systems.\nTimex of Portugal developed and produced several branded computers, including a PAL region-compatible version of the Timex Sinclair 2068, known as the Timex Computer 2048. This variant features distinct buffers for both the ULA and the CPU, significantly enhancing compatibility with ZX Spectrum software compared to the American model. Software developed for the Portuguese-made 2048 remained fully compatible with its American counterpart, as the ROMs were left unaltered. Timex of Portugal also created a ZX Spectrum \"emulator\" in cartridge form. Several other upgrades were introduced, including a BASIC64 cartridge enabling it to utilise high-resolution (512x192) modes. This model saw significant success in both Portugal and Poland.\nIn India, Deci Bells Electronics Limited based in Pune, introduced a licensed version of the Spectrum+ in 1988. Dubbed the \"dB Spectrum+\", it performed well in the Indian market, selling over 50,000 units and achieving an 80% market share.\nUnofficial clones.\nNumerous unofficial Spectrum clones were produced, especially in Eastern Europe. Many small start-ups in the Soviet Union assembled various clones, distributed through poster adverts and street stalls. Over 50 such clone models existed in total. In Czechoslovakia, the first production ZX Spectrum clone was the Didaktik Gama, sporting two switched 32\u00a0KB memory banks and 16\u00a0KB of slower RAM containing graphical data for video output, followed by Didaktik M, with later availability of a 5.25\"/3.5\" floppy disk drives; and a Didaktik Kompakt clone with a built-in floppy drive. There were also clones produced in South America, such as the Brazilian-made TK90X and TK95, as well as the Argentine Czerweny CZ models.\nIn the United Kingdom, Spectrum peripheral vendor Miles Gordon Technology (MGT) released the SAM Coup\u00e9 8-bit home computer in December 1989. It was designed to be fully compatible with the ZX Spectrum 48K, housing a Zilog Z80B processor clocked at 6\u00a0MHz and 256KB of RAM. By this point, the Amiga and Atari ST had taken hold of the market, leaving MGT in eventual receivership in June 1990. In his book \"Retro Tech\", Peter Leigh considers the Sam Coup\u00e9 to be the \"true\" successor of the ZX Spectrum.\nPeripherals.\nSeveral peripherals were developed and marketed by Sinclair. The ZX Printer, a small spark printer, was already on the market upon the ZX Spectrum's release, as its computer bus was partially backward-compatible with that of its predecessor, the ZX81. It uses two electrically charged styli to burn away the surface of aluminium-coated paper to reveal the black underlay.\nThe ZX Interface 1 add-on module, launched in 1983, includes 8\u00a0KB of ROM, an RS-232 serial port, a proprietary local area network (LAN) interface known as ZX Net, and a port for connecting up to eight ZX Microdrives\u00a0\u2013 tape-loop cartridge storage devices released in July 1983, known for their speed, albeit with some reliability concerns. Sinclair Research also introduced the ZX Interface 2, which added two joystick ports and a ROM cartridge port. Although the ZX Microdrives were initially greeted with good reviews, they never became a popular distribution method due to fears over cartridge quality and piracy.\nThird-party hardware add-ons were available throughout the machine's life, including the Kempston joystick interface, the Morex Peripherals Centronics/RS-232 interface, the Currah Microspeech unit for speech synthesis, Videoface Digitiser, the SpecDrum drum machine, and the Multiface, a snapshot and disassembly tool from Romantic Robot. After the original ZX Spectrum's keyboard received criticism for its \"dead flesh\" feel, external keyboards became popular. In 1983, DK'Tronics launched a Light Pen compatible with some drawing software.\nThe Abbeydale Designers/Watford Electronics SPDOS and KDOS disk drive interfaces were bundled with office productivity software, including the Tasword word processor, Masterfile database, and Omnicalc spreadsheet. This bundle, along with OCP's Stock Control, Finance, and Payroll systems, introduced small businesses to streamlined computerised operations. In 1987 and 1988, Miles Gordon Technology released the DISCiPLE and +D systems. These systems had the capability to store memory images as disk snapshots, allowing users to restore the Spectrum to its exact previous state. Both systems were compatible with the Microdrive command syntax, simplifying the porting of existing software.\nIn the mid-1980s, Telemap Group launched a fee-based service allowing ZX Spectrum users to connect their machines to the Micronet 800 information provider via a Prism Micro Products VTX5000 modem. Micronet 800, hosted by Prestel, provided news and information about microcomputers and offered a form of instant messaging and online shopping.\nSoftware.\nMost Spectrum software was originally distributed on audio cassette tapes, intended to work with consumer cassette recorders. Software was also distributed through type-in program listings in magazines and books. The reader entered a program by hand and saved it to cassette for later use. Some magazines distributed 7\" 33&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20443 rpm flexi disc records, or \"Floppy ROMs\", a variant of regular vinyl records which could be played on a standard record player. Some radio stations broadcast audio stream data via frequency modulation or medium wave so listeners could directly record it onto an audio cassette themselves. ZX Spectrum-focused radio programmes existed in the United Kingdom, which were received over long distances on domestic radio receivers.\nSoftware released for the machine includes programming languages, databases, word processors (\"Tasword\" being the most prominent), spreadsheets, drawing and painting tools (e.g. OCP Art Studio), 3D-modelling (e.g. VU-3D) and archaeology software. Over 24,000 different software titles were released for the ZX Spectrum throughout its lifespan. Beginning in August 1982 the ZX Spectrum was bundled with \"\", a compilation of ten demonstration programs. \nThe ZX Spectrum has an extensive library of video games which established it as a prominent gaming platform in the 1980s, including \"Manic Miner\", \"Jet Set Willy\", \"Chuckie Egg\", \"Elite\", \"Sabre Wulf\", \"Knight Lore\", and \"The Hobbit\". \"Ant Attack\" is the first video game with isometric graphics, \"Turbo Esprit\", the first open world driving game, and \"Redhawk\" features the first superhero created specifically for a video game. Many ZX81 games were rewritten for the Spectrum to take advantage of the newer machine's colour and sound, such as Psion's \"Flight Simulation\". Hardware limitations of the machine required a level of creativity from video game designers.\nReception.\nInitial reception of the ZX Spectrum was generally positive. Critics in Britain welcomed the new machine as a worthy successor to the ZX81; Robin Bradbeer of \"Sinclair User\" praised the additional keyboard functions the Spectrum had to offer, and lauded the \"strength\" of its ergonomic and presentable design. Tim Hartnell from \"Your Computer\" noted that Sinclair had improved on the shortcomings of the ZX80 and ZX81 by revamping the Spectrum's load and save functions, noting that it made working with the machine \"a pleasure\". Hartnell concluded that despite minor faults, the machine was \"way ahead\" of its competitors, and its specification exceeded that of the BBC Micro Model A.\n\"Computer and Video Games\"' Terry Pratt compared the Spectrum's keyboard negatively to the typewriter-style used on the BBC Micro, opining that it was an improvement over the ZX81 but unsuited for \"typists\". In similar vein, David Tebbutt from \"Personal Computer World\" felt that the Spectrum's keyboard felt more like a calculator than typewriter, but praised its functional versatility. Likewise, Gregg Williams from \"BYTE\" criticised the keyboard, declaring that despite the machine's attractive price the layout \"is impossible to justify\" and \"poorly designed\" in several respects. Williams was sceptical of the computer's appeal to American consumers if sold for US$\u00a0\u2013 \"hardly competitive with comparable low-cost American units\"\u00a0\u2013 and expected that Timex would sell it for . A more negative review came from Jim Lennox of \"Technology Week\", who wrote that \"after using it\u00a0[...] I find Sinclair's claim that it is the most powerful computer under \u00a3500 unsustainable. Compared to more powerful machines, it is slow, its colour graphics are disappointing, its BASIC limited and its keyboard confusing\".\nLegacy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n \"You cannot exaggerate Sir Clive Sinclair\u2019s influence on the world [...] All your UK video game companies today were built on the shoulders of giants who made games for the ZX Spectrum.\"\n \u2014 Television presenter Dominik Diamond on Sinclair's death in 2021.\nThe role of the ZX Spectrum in the history of personal computers and video games made it one of the most important and influential computers of the 1980s. Some observers credit it as being responsible for launching the British information technology industry during a period of recession, while introducing home computing to the masses. As of 2024[ [update]], it is also one of the best-selling British computers of all time, with over five million units sold by the end of the Spectrum's lifespan in 1992. It retained the title of Britain's top-selling computer until the Amstrad PCW surpassed it in the 1990s, with eight million units sold by the end of the PCW's lifespan in 1998. The ZX Spectrum is affectionately known as the \"Speccy\" by elements of its fan following.\nThe ZX Spectrum was popular in communist Czechoslovakia, with an estimated 100,000 in the country by 1988 making it the most popular home computer of the time. This was despite only briefly being officially distributed, and never advertised. Its small size made it easier to smuggle into the country to avoid high customs fees.\nA number of notable game developers began their careers on the ZX Spectrum. Tim and Chris Stamper founded Ultimate Play the Game in 1982, who found success \"Jetpac\" (1983), \"Atic Atac\" (1983), \"Sabre Wulf\" (1984), and \"Knight Lore\" (1984). The Stamper brothers later founded Rare, which became Nintendo's first Western third-party developer. David Perry, the founder of Shiny Entertainment, moved from Northern Ireland to England to focus on developing games for the ZX Spectrum.\nOther developers, well known for their ZX Spectrum games, include (alphabetically): Pete Cooke (\"Tau Ceti\"), Julian Gollop (', \"Rebelstar\" and the \"X-COM\" series), Jon Ritman (\"Match Day\", \"Head Over Heels\"), Mike Singleton (\"The Lords of Midnight\", \"Doomdark's Revenge\", \"War in Middle Earth\"), Jonathan \"Joffa\" Smith (', \"Mikie\", \"Hyper Sports\"), Matthew Smith (\"Manic Miner\", \"Jet Set Willy\"), Clive Townsend (\"Saboteur\"), The Oliver Twins (the \"Dizzy\" series), Sandy White (\"Ant Attack\", among the first isometric games; \"I, of the Mask\"). Despite the system only having a beeper for audio, musicians such as David Whittaker, Tim Follin and others, created multichannel music for games.\nSome hobbyists have continued to code for the Spectrum via emulators. Several games have been released commercially from new software houses such as Cronosoft. In 2020, a museum dedicated Sinclair computers opened in Cantanhede, Portugal.\nRecreations.\nIn 2013, an FPGA-based clone known as the ZX Uno, was announced. All of its hardware, firmware and software are open source, released as Creative Commons licence Share-alike. The use of a Spartan FPGA allows the system to not only re-implement the ZX Spectrum, but many other 8-bit computers and games consoles. The Uno was successfully crowdfunded in 2016 and the first boards went on sale the same year.\nIn January 2014, Elite Systems, who produced a successful range of software for the original ZX Spectrum in the 1980s, announced plans for a Spectrum-themed Bluetooth keyboard that would attach to mobile devices. The company used a crowdfunding campaign to fund the \"Recreated ZX Spectrum\", which would be compatible with games the company had already released on iTunes and Google Play. Elite Systems took down its Spectrum Collection application the following month, due to complaints from authors of the original software that they had not been paid for the content. \"Wired UK\" described the finished device, which was styled as an original Spectrum 48k keyboard, as \"absolutely gorgeous\" but said it was ultimately more of an expensive novelty than an actual Spectrum. In July 2019, \"Eurogamer\" reported that many of the orders had yet to be delivered due to a dispute between Elite Systems and their manufacturer, Eurotech.\nLater in 2014, the ZX Spectrum Vega retro video game console was announced by Retro Computers and crowdfunded on Indiegogo with the backing of Clive Sinclair. The Vega, released in 2015, took the form of a handheld TV game but the lack of a full keyboard led to criticism from reviewers due to the large number of text adventures supplied with the device. Most reviewers branded the device cheap and uncomfortable to use. The follow-up, the ZX Spectrum Vega+, was designed as a handheld game console. Despite reaching its crowdfunding target in March 2016, the company failed to fulfil the majority of orders. Reviewing the Vega+, \"The Register\" criticised numerous aspects and features of the machine, including its design and build quality and summed up by saying that the \"entire feel is plasticky and inconsequential\". Retro Computers Ltd was placed into liquidation in 2019.\nThe ZX Spectrum Next is an expanded and updated version of the ZX Spectrum computer implemented with FPGA technology funded by a Kickstarter campaign in April 2017, with the board-only computer delivered to backers later that year. The finished machine, including a case designed by Rick Dickinson who died during the development of the project, was released to backers in February 2020. \"MagPi\" called it \"a lovely piece of kit\", noting that it is \"well-designed and well-built: authentic to the original, and with technology that nods to the past while remaining functional and relevant in the modern age\". \"PC Pro\" magazine called the Next \"undeniably impressive\" while noting that some features were \"not quite ready\". A further Kickstarter for an improved revision of the hardware was funded in August 2020.\nThe ZX Touch is a handheld gaming console, released by Elmar Electronic in November 2023, that uses bare-metal emulation to play ZX Spectrum games. It features a 7-inch touchscreen, built-in games, and microSD support for loading additional games.\nIn August 2024, Retro Games announced that they would be releasing a recreation of the ZX Spectrum titled \"The Spectrum\" which would include 48 built-in games, a save game option, rewind mode and pre-owned titles load up. It was released on 22 November 2024.\nIn popular culture.\nA running gag in the film \"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World\" has character Julie Powers censored with ZX Spectrum sound effects. Director Edgar Wright stated that he used to wait for Spectrum games to load when he was a teenager. \nOn 23 April 2012, a Google doodle honoured the 30th anniversary of the Spectrum. As it coincided with St George's Day, the Google logo was of St George fighting a dragon in the style of a Spectrum loading screen. \nOne of the alternate endings in the interactive film \"\" (2018) includes the main character playing data tape audio that, when loaded into a ZX Spectrum emulator, generates a QR code leading to a website with a playable version of the \"Nohzdyve\" game from the film.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "34471", "revid": "34037813", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34471", "title": "Zohar", "text": "Foundational work in Kabbalah literature\nThe Zohar (, lit. 'Splendor' or 'Radiance') is a foundational work of Kabbalistic literature. It is a group of books including commentary on the mystical aspects of the Torah and scriptural interpretations as well as material on mysticism, mythical cosmogony, and mystical psychology. The \"Zohar\" contains discussions of the nature of God, the origin and structure of the universe, the nature of souls, redemption, the relationship of ego to darkness and \"true self\" to \"the light of God\".\nThe \"Zohar\" was first publicized by Moses de Le\u00f3n (c. 1240 \u2013 1305 CE), who claimed it was a Tannaitic work recording the teachings of Simeon ben Yochai (c.\u2009100 CE). This claim is universally rejected by modern scholars, most of whom believe de Le\u00f3n, also an infamous forger of Geonic material, wrote the book himself between 1280 and 1286. Some scholars argue that the \"Zohar\" is the work of multiple medieval authors and/or contains a small amount of genuinely antique novel material. Later additions to the \"Zohar\", including \"Tiqqune hazZohar\" and \"Ra'ya Meheimna\", were composed by a 14th century imitator.\nLanguage.\nZoharic Aramaic.\nAccording to Gershom Scholem and other modern scholars, Zoharic Aramaic is an artificial dialect largely based on a linguistic fusion of the Babylonian Talmud and Targum Onkelos, but confused by de Le\u00f3n's simple and imperfect grammar, his limited vocabulary, and his reliance on loanwords, including from contemporaneous medieval languages. The author further confused his text with occasional strings of Aramaic-seeming gibberish, in order to give the impression of obscure knowledge.\nZoharic Hebrew.\nThe original text of the \"Zohar\", as cited by various early Kabbalists beginning around the 14th century (e.g. Isaac b. Samuel of Acre, David b. Judah the Pious, Israel Alnaqua, Alfonso de Zamora) was partly in Hebrew and partly in Aramaic. By the time of the first edition (1558) the text was entirely in Aramaic, with the exception of the \"Midrash haNe'elam\", where Hebrew words and phrases are often employed as in the Babylonian Talmud. \"The Hebrew of the \"Midrash haNe'elam\" is similar in its overall form to the language of the early midrashim, but its specific vocabulary, idioms, and stylistic characteristics bear the imprint of medieval Hebrew, and its midrashic manner is clearly that of a later imitation.\"\nAuthorship.\nInitial view.\nAuthorship of the \"Zohar\" was questioned from the outset, due to the claim that it was discovered by one person and referred to historical events of the post-Talmudic period while purporting to be from an earlier date. Abraham Zacuto's 1504 work \"Sefer Yuhasin\" (first printed 1566) quotes from the Kabbalist Isaac ben Samuel of Acre's 13th century memoir \"Divre hayYamim\" (lost), which claims that the widow and daughter of de Le\u00f3n revealed that he had written it himself and only ascribed the authorship to Simeon ben Yochai for personal profit:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;And [Isaac] went to Spain, to investigate how it happened in his time that the Book of the Zohar was found, which Simeon ben Yochai and his son Elazar had made in the cave . . . and some say that [de Leon] forged it among his forgeries, but [Isaac later] said that the Palestinian Aramaic sections were genuinely written by Simeon b. Yochai . . . And [Isaac] wrote:\nBecause I had seen that these words were wonderous, that they ran from a well high above which is beyond those uninitiated into the secrets of the divine, I chased after it and I asked the scholars . . . and some said it had fallen into the hand of the sage Moses de Leon, whom they call Moses of Guadalajara, and some said Simeon ben Yochai had never written this book, but that Moses had written these wonderous words and falsely ascribed them to Simeon ben Yochai and his son Elazar in order to sell them for huge sums of money. And I went to Spain, to the capital city of Valladolid, and presented myself to Moses, and was received favorably, and he swore to me by the Lord that the ancient book of Simeon ben Yochai was that day in his house in \u00c1vila, and that he would show it to me when I visited him, and Moses parted from me to return home, but he sickened in Ar\u00e9valo on the way, and he died there, and when I heard of this I was mortally pained, and I took to the road, and I came to \u00c1vila, and I found a great old sage there named David de Pancorbo, and he received me favorably, and I demanded he explain to me the secrets of the Book of the Zohar, about which men were disputing, and about which Moses himself had sworn beyond doubt until his death, but about which I did not know upon whom to rely or whom to trust, and he told me, \"Know in truth that it is clear to me beyond doubt that it never came to the hand of this Moses, and that there is no Book of the Zohar except that of which Moses himself wrote every word. Know that this Moses was a great spendthrift; one day his house was filled with treasures that the wealthy mystics had given him in exchange for excerpts, and the next his wife and children were starving naked in the street. So when we heard that he had died in Ar\u00e9valo, I went to the house of the richest man in the city, Joseph de \u00c1vila, and said to him, 'Now the time has come for you to earn the priceless Zohar if you will do what I advise', and he followed my advice, and he sent his wife to the house of Moses' widow, and she said to her, 'Know that my wish is to marry your daughter to my son, and I ask nothing from you except the Book of the Zohar from which your husband excerpted for many people,' and Moses' widow swore to Joseph's wife, 'By the Lord, my husband never had such a book except in his mind, and everything he wrote came from his own intellect. When I saw him writing, I asked him why he claimed to be excerpting from a book I knew he did not have, and he told me that it was because, while for his own words they would not give a penny, for the divinely inspired work of Simeon ben Yochai they will pay in blood.' And Moses' daughter said exactly the same.\" Can you ask for better proof than this?\nIsaac goes on to say that he obtained mixed evidence of Zohar's authenticity from other Spanish Kabbalists, but the fragment ends abruptly, mid-sentence, without any conclusion. Though Isaac is willing to quote it in his \"Otzar haChayyim\" and his \"Meirat Einayim\", he does so rarely. Isaac's testimony was censored from the second edition (1580) and remained absent from all editions thereafter until its restoration nearly 300 years later in the 1857 edition. In 1243 a different Jew had reportedly found a different ancient mystical book in a cave near Toledo, which may have been de Leon's inspiration.\nWithin fifty years of its appearance in Spain it was quoted by Kabbalists, including the Italian mystical writer Menahem Recanati and Todros ben Joseph Abulafia. However, Joseph ben Waqar harshly attacked the \"Zohar\", which he considered inauthentic, and some Jewish communities, such as the Dor Daim from Yemen, Andalusian (Western Sefardic or Spanish and Portuguese Jews), and some Italian communities, never accepted it as authentic. Other early Kabbalists, such as David b. Judah the Pious (fl. c. 1300), Abraham b. Isaac of Granada, (fl. c. 1300), and David b. Amram of Aden (fl. c. 1350), so readily imitate its pseudepigraphy by ascribing contemporaries' statements to Zoharic sages that it is obvious they understood its nature. The manuscripts of the \"Zohar\" are from the 14th-16th centuries.\nLate Middle Ages.\nBy the 15th century, the \"Zohar\"'s authority in the Iberian Jewish community was such that Joseph ibn Shem-Tov drew arguments from it in his attacks against Maimonides, and even representatives of non-mystical Jewish thought began to assert its sacredness and invoke its authority in the decision of some ritual questions. In Jacobs' and Broyde's view, they were attracted by its glorification of man, its doctrine of immortality, and its ethical principles, which they saw as more in keeping with the spirit of Talmudic Judaism than are those taught by the philosophers, and which was held in contrast to the view of Maimonides and his followers, who regarded man as a fragment of the universe whose immortality is dependent upon the degree of development of his active intellect. The \"Zohar\" instead declared Man to be the lord of creation, whose immortality is solely dependent upon his morality.\nConversely, Elia del Medigo (c.\u20091458\u00a0\u2013 c.\u20091493), in his \"Be\u1e25inat ha-Dat\", endeavored to show that the \"Zohar\" could not be attributed to Simeon ben Yochai, by a number of arguments. He claims that if it were his work, the \"Zohar\" would have been mentioned by the Talmud, as has been the case with other works of the Talmudic period; he claims that had ben Yochai known by divine revelation the hidden meaning of the precepts, his decisions on Jewish law from the Talmudic period would have been adopted by the Talmud, that it would not contain the names of rabbis who lived at a later period than that of ben Yochai; he claims that if the Kabbalah were a revealed doctrine, there would have been no divergence of opinion among the Kabbalists concerning the mystic interpretation of the precepts.\nBelievers in the authenticity of the \"Zohar\" countered that the lack of references to the work in Jewish literature was because ben Yochai did not commit his teachings to writing but transmitted them orally to his disciples over generations until finally the doctrines were embodied in the \"Zohar\". They found it unsurprising that ben Yochai should have foretold future happenings or made references to historical events of the post-Talmudic period.\nBy the late 16th century, the \"Zohar\" was present in one-tenth of all private Jewish libraries in Mantua. The authenticity of the \"Zohar\" was accepted by such 16th century Jewish luminaries as Joseph Karo (d. 1575), and Solomon Luria (d. 1574), who wrote nonetheless that Jewish law does not follow the \"Zohar\" when it is contradicted by the Babylonian Talmud.\nLuria writes that the \"Zohar\" cannot even override a minhag. Moses Isserles (d. 1572) writes that he \"heard\" that the author of the \"Zohar\" is ben Yochai. Elijah Levita (d. 1559) did not believe in its antiquity, nor did Joseph Scaliger (d. 1609) or Louis Cappel (d. 1658) or Johannes Drusius (d. 1616). David ibn abi Zimra (d. 1573) held that one can follow the \"Zohar\" only when it does not conflict with any other source and records that \"You asked me about scribes modifying torah scrolls to accord with the \"Zohar\" ... and I was shocked, for how can they consider the \"Zohar\" better than the Talmud Bavli, which has come down to us? ... So I went myself to the house of the scribe and I found three scrolls which he had edited, and I fixed them, and I restored the Torah to its proper glory.\"\nEnlightenment Period.\nDebate continued over the generations; del Medigo's arguments were echoed by Leon of Modena (d. 1648) in his \"Ari Nohem\", by Jean Morin (d. 1659), and by Jacob Emden (d. 1776).\nEmden\u2014who may have been familiar with Modena through Morin's arguments\u2014devoted a book to the criticism of the \"Zohar\", called \"Mitpachas Sefarim\" (\u05de\u05d8\u05e4\u05d7\u05ea \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd), in an effort against the remaining adherents of the Sabbatean movement (in which Sabbatai Zevi, a Jewish apostate, cited Messianic prophecies from the \"Zohar\" as proof of his legitimacy). Emden argued that the book on which Zevi based his doctrines was a forgery, arguing that the \"Zohar\":\nSaul Berlin (d. 1794) argued that the presence of an introduction in the \"Zohar\", unknown to the Talmudic literary genre, itself indicates a medieval date.\nIn the Ashkenazi community of Eastern Europe, religious authorities including Elijah of Vilna (d. 1797) and Shneur Zalman of Liadi (d. 1812) believed in the authenticity of the \"Zohar\", while Ezekiel Landau (d. 1793), in his sefer \"Derushei HaTzlach\" (\u05d3\u05e8\u05d5\u05e9\u05d9 \u05d4\u05e6\u05dc\"\u05d7), argued that the \"Zohar\" is to be considered unreliable as it was made public many hundreds of years after Ben Yochai's death and lacks an unbroken tradition of authenticity, among other reasons.\nIsaac Satanow accepted Emden's arguments and referred to the \"Zohar\" as a forgery, also offering new evidence. By 1813 Samuel David Luzzatto had concluded that \"these books [the Zohar and the Tiqqunei Zohar] are utter forgeries,\" in part because they repeatedly discuss the Hebrew cantillation marks, which were not invented until the 9th century. In 1817 Luzzatto published these arguments, and in 1825 he penned a fuller treatise, giving many reasons why the \"Zohar\" could not be ancient. However, he did not publish this until 1852, when he felt it justified by the rise of Hasidism. Moses Landau (d. 1852), Ezekiel's grandson, published the same conclusion in 1822. Isaac Haver (d. 1852) admits the vast majority of content comes from the 13th century but argues that there was a genuine core. Solomon Judah Loeb Rapoport (d. 1867) spoke against the \"Zohar\"'s antiquity. Eliakim ha-Milzahgi (d. 1854) accepted Emden's arguments.\nThe influence of the \"Zohar\" in Yemen contributed to the formation of the Dor Deah movement, led by Yi\u1e25yah Qafi\u1e25 in the later part of the 19th century. Among its objects was the opposition of the influence of the \"Zohar\", as presented in Qafi\u1e25's \"Milhamoth Hashem\" (Wars of the Lord) and \"Da'at Elohim\".\nShlomo Zalman Geiger (d. 1878), in his book \"Divrei Kehilot\" on the liturgical practice of Frankfurt am Main, records that \"We do not say \"brikh shmei\" in Frankfurt, because its source is in the \"Zohar\", and the sages of Frankfurt refused to accept Qabbalah.\"\nModern religious views.\nIn 1892, Adolf Neubauer called on the Orthodox rabbinate to reject the \"Zohar\" as a forgery and to remove Zoharic prayers from the liturgy. However, Yechiel Michel Epstein (d. 1908) and Yisrael Meir Kagan (d. 1933) both believed in the authenticity of the \"Zohar\", as did Menachem Mendel Kasher (d. 1983), Aryeh Kaplan (d. 1983), David Luria (d. 1855), and Chaim Kanievsky (d. 2022). The foremost halachik authority of the 20th Century, Moshe Feinstein, stated unequivocally that the \"Zohar\" and \"Tikkunim\" are words of the Tannaim. Aryeh Carmell (d. 2006) did not, and Eliyahu Dessler (d. 1953) accepted the possibility that it was composed in the 13th century. Gedaliah Nadel (d. 2004) was unsure if the \"Zohar\" were genuine but was sure that it is acceptable to believe that it is not. Ovadia Yosef (d. 2013) held that Orthodox Jews should accept the \"Zohar\"'s antiquity in practice based on medieval precedent, but agreed that rejecting it is rational and religiously valid. Joseph Hertz (d. 1946) called the claim of ben Yochai's authorship \"untenable\", citing Gershom Scholem's evidence. Samuel Belkin (d. 1976) argued that the Mystical Midrash section, specifically, predated de Le\u00f3n. Joseph B. Soloveitchik (d. 1993) apparently dismissed the \"Zohar\"'s antiquity. Moses Gaster (d. 1939) wrote that the claim of ben Yochai's authorship was \"untenable\" but that Moses de Le\u00f3n had compiled earlier material. Meir Mazuz (d. 2025) accepts Emden's arguments. Yeshayahu Leibowitz wrote (1990) that \"Moses de Le\u00f3n composed the \"Zohar\" in the 1270s as certainly as Theodor Herzl composed \"Der Judenstaat\" in the 1890s ... the \"Zohar\" was influential because in every generation the idolatrous influence outpowers the true faith\".\nModern critical views.\nEarly attempts included M. H. Landauer's \"Vorl\u00e4ufiger Bericht \u00fcber meine Entdeckung in Ansehung des Sohar\" (1845), which fingered Abraham Abulafia as the author, and Samuel David Luzzatto's \"\u05d5\u05d9\u05db\u05d5\u05d7 \u05e2\u05dc \u05d7\u05db\u05de\u05ea \u05d4\u05e7\u05d1\u05dc\u05d4\" (1852), but the first systematic and critical academic proof for the authorship of Moses de Le\u00f3n was given by Adolf Jellinek in his 1851 monograph \"Moses ben Shem-tob de Le\u00f3n und sein Verh\u00e4ltnis zum Sohar\". Jellinek's proofs, which combined previous analyses with Isaac of Acre's testimony and comparison of the \"Zohar\" to de Leon's Hebrew works, were accepted by every other major scholar in the field, including Heinrich Graetz (\"History of the Jews\", vol. 7), Moritz Steinschneider, Bernhard Beer, Leopold Zunz, and Christian David Ginsburg. Ginsburg summarized Jellinek's, Graetz's, and other scholars' proofs for the English-reading world in 1865, also introducing several novel proofs, including that the \"Zohar\" includes a translation of a poem by Solomon ibn Gabirol (d. 1058) and that it includes a mystical explanation of a mezuzah style only introduced in the 13th century. Adolf Neubauer and Samuel Rolles Driver were convinced by these arguments, but Edward Bouverie Pusey held to a Tannaitic date.\nBy 1913, the critical view had apparently lost some support: Israel Abrahams recalls that \"Zunz, like Graetz, had little patience with the Zohar . . . at this date we are much more inclined to treat the Kabbalah with respect.\"\nGershom Scholem, who was to found modern academic study of Kabbalah, began his career at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1925 with a lecture in which he promised to refute Graetz and Jellinek. However, after years of research, he came to conclusions similar to theirs by 1938, when he argued again that de Le\u00f3n was the most likely author. Scholem noted the \"Zohar's\" frequent errors in Aramaic grammar, its suspicious traces of Arabic and Spanish words and sentence patterns, and its lack of knowledge of the Land of Israel, among other proofs.\nScholem's views are widely held as accurate among historians of Kabbalah, but they are not uncritically accepted. Scholars who continue to research the background of the \"Zohar\" include Yehuda Liebes (who wrote his doctorate thesis for Scholem on the subject, \"Dictionary of the Vocabulary of the Zohar\" in 1976), and Daniel C. Matt, a student of Scholem's who has published a critical edition of the \"Zohar\".\nInfluences.\nAcademic studies of the \"Zohar\" show that many of its ideas are based in the Talmud, various works of midrash, and earlier Jewish mystical works. Scholem writes:\nThe writer had expert knowledge of the early material and he often used it as a foundation for his expositions, putting into it variations of his own. His main sources were the Babylonian Talmud, the complete Midrash Rabbah, the Midrash Tanhuma, and the two Pesiktot (Pesikta De-Rav Kahana or Pesikta Rabbati), the Midrash on Psalms, the Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer, and the Targum Onkelos. Generally speaking, they are not quoted exactly, but translated into the peculiar style of the \"Zohar\" and summarized. [...]\nLess use is made of the halakhic Midrashim, the Jerusalem Talmud, and the other Targums, nor of the Midrashim like the Aggadat Shir ha-Shirim, the Midrash on Proverbs, and the Alfabet de-R. Akiva. It is not clear whether the author used the Yalkut Simeoni, or whether he knew the sources of its aggadah separately. Of the smaller Midrashim he used the Heikhalot Rabbati, the Alfabet de-Ben Sira, the Sefer Zerubabel, the Baraita de-Ma'aseh Bereshit, [and many others] [...]\nAt the same time, Scholem says, the author \"invent[ed] a number of fictitious works that the \"Zohar\" supposedly quotes, \"e.g.\", the Sifra de-Adam, the Sifra de-Hanokh, the Sifra di-Shelomo Malka, the Sifra de-Rav Hamnuna Sava, the Sifra de-Rav Yeiva Sava, the Sifra de-Aggadeta, the Raza de-Razin and many others.\"\nThe \"Zohar\" also draws from the Bible commentaries written by medieval rabbis, including Rashi, Abraham ibn Ezra, David Kimhi and even authorities as late as Nachmanides and Maimonides, and earlier mystical texts such as the \"Sefer Yetzirah\" and the \"Bahir\" and the medieval writings of the Hasidei Ashkenaz.\nAnother influence that Scholem, and scholars like Yehudah Liebes and Ronit Meroz have identified was a circle of Spanish Kabbalists in Castile who dealt with the appearance of an evil side emanating from within the world of the sefirot. Scholem saw this dualism of good and evil within the Godhead as a kind of gnostic inclination within Kabbalah, and as a predecessor of the \"Sitra Ahra\" (the other, evil side) in the \"Zohar\". The main text of the Castile circle, the \"Treatise on the Left Emanation\", was written by Jacob ha-Cohen around 1265.\nContents.\nPrintings, editions, and indexing.\n\"Tikunei haZohar\" was first printed in Mantua in 1557. The main body of the \"Zohar\" was printed in Cremona in 1558 (a one-volume edition), in Mantua in 1558-1560 (a three-volume edition), and in Salonika in 1597 (a two-volume edition). Each of these editions included somewhat different texts. When they were printed there were many partial manuscripts in circulation that were not available to the first printers. These were later printed as \"Zohar Chadash\" (lit.\u2009'New Radiance'), but \"Zohar Chadash\" actually contains parts that pertain to the \"Zohar\", as well as \"Tikunim\" (plural of \"Tikun\", \"Repair\", see also \"Tikkun olam\") that are akin to \"Tikunei haZohar\", as described below. The term \"Zohar\", in usage, may refer to just the first \"Zohar\" collection, with or without the applicable sections of \"Zohar Chadash\", or to the entire \"Zohar\" and Tikunim.\nCitations referring to the \"Zohar\" conventionally follow the volume and page numbers of the Mantua edition, while citations referring to \"Tikkunei haZohar\" follow the edition of Ortakoy (Constantinople) 1719 whose text and pagination became the basis for most subsequent editions. Volumes II and III begin their numbering anew, so citation can be made by \"parashah\" and page number (e.g. \"Zohar: Nasso\" 127a), or by volume and page number (e.g. \"Zohar\" III:127a).\nThe \"New Zohar\" (\u05d6\u05d5\u05d4\u05e8 \u05d7\u05d3\u05e9).\nAfter the book of the \"Zohar\" had been printed (in Mantua and in Cremona, in the Jewish years 5318\u20135320 or 1558\u20131560? CE), many more manuscripts were found that included paragraphs pertaining to the \"Zohar\" which had not been included in printed editions. The manuscripts pertained also to all parts of the \"Zohar\"; some were similar to \"Zohar\" on the Torah, some were similar to the inner parts of the \"Zohar\" (\"Midrash haNe'elam, Sitrei Otiyot\" and more), and some pertained to \"Tikunei haZohar\". Some thirty years after the first edition of the \"Zohar\" was printed, the manuscripts were gathered and arranged according to the \"parashiyot\" of the Torah and the megillot (apparently the arrangement was done by the Kabbalist, Avraham haLevi of Tsfat), and were printed first in Salonika in Jewish year 5357 (1587? CE), and then in Krak\u00f3w (5363), and afterwards in various editions.\nStructure.\nAccording to Scholem, the \"Zohar\" can be divided into 21 types of content, of which the first 18 (a.\u2013s.) are the work of the original author (probably de Leon) and the final 3 (t.\u2013v.) are the work of a later imitator.\na. Untitled Torah commentary\nA \"bulky part\" which is \"wholly composed of discursive commentaries on various passages from the Torah\".\nb. Book of Concealment (\u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d3\u05e6\u05e0\u05d9\u05e2\u05d5\u05ea\u05d0)\nA short part of only six pages, containing a commentary to the first six chapters of Genesis. It is \"highly oracular and obscure,\" citing no authorities and explaining nothing.\nc. Greater Assembly (\u05d0\u05d3\u05e8\u05d0 \u05e8\u05d1\u05d0)\nThis part contains an explanation of the oracular hints in the previous section. Ben Yochai's friends gather together to discuss secrets of Kabbalah. After the opening of the discussion by ben Yochai, the sages rise, one after the other, and lecture on the secret of Divinity, while ben Yochai adds to and responds to their words. The sages become steadily more ecstatic until three of them die. Scholem calls this part \"architecturally perfect.\"\nd. Lesser Assembly (\u05d0\u05d3\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d6\u05d5\u05d8\u05d0)\nBen Yochai dies and a speech is quoted in which he explains the previous section.\ne. Assembly of the Tabernacle (\u05d0\u05d3\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d3\u05de\u05e9\u05db\u05e0\u05d0)\nThis part has the same structure as c. but discusses instead the mysticism of prayer.\nf. Palaces (\u05d4\u05d9\u05db\u05dc\u05d5\u05ea)\nSeven palaces of light are described, which are perceived by the devout in death. This description appears again in another passage, heavily embellished.\ng. Secretum Secretorum (\u05e8\u05d6\u05d0 \u05d3\u05e8\u05d6\u05d9\u05df)\nAn anonymous discourse on physiognomy and a discourse on chiromancy by ben Yochai.\nh. Old Man (\u05e1\u05d1\u05d0)\nAn elaborate narrative about a speech by an old Kabbalist.\ni. Child (\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5\u05e7\u05d0)\nA story of a prodigy and his Kabbalistic speech.\nk. Head of the Academy (\u05e8\u05d1 \u05de\u05ea\u05d9\u05d1\u05ea\u05d0)\nA Pardes narrative in which a head of the celestial academy reveals secrets about the destinies of the soul.\nl. Secrets of Torah (\u05e1\u05ea\u05e8\u05d9 \u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4)\nAllegorical and mystical interpretations of Torah passages.\nm. Mishnas (\u05de\u05ea\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea\u05d9\u05df)\nImitations of the Mishnaic style, designed to introduce longer commentaries in the style of the Talmud.\nn. Zohar to the Song of Songs\nKabbalistic commentary to the Song of Songs.\no. Standard of Measure (\u05e7\u05d5 \u05d4\u05de\u05d9\u05d3\u05d4)\nProfound interpretation of Deut. 6:4.\np. Secrets of Letters (\u05e1\u05ea\u05e8\u05d9 \u05d0\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea)\nA monologue by ben Yochai on the letters in the names of God and their use in creation.\nq. Commentary to the Merkabah\nr. Mystical Midrash (\u05de\u05d3\u05e8\u05e9 \u05d4\u05e0\u05e2\u05dc\u05dd)\nA Kabbalistic commentary on the Torah, citing a wide variety of Talmudic sages. According to Ramaz, it is fit to be called \"Midrash haNe'elam\" because \"its topic is mostly the \"neshamah\" (an upper level of soul), the source of which is in \"Beri'ah\", which is the place of the upper Gan Eden; and it is written in the \"Pardes\" that drash is in \"Beri'ah\"...\u00a0and the revealed midrash is the secret of externality, and \"Midrash haNe'elam\" is the secret of internality, which is the neshamah. And this derush is founded on the neshamah; its name befits it\u2014\"Midrash haNe'elam\".\nThe language of \"Midrash haNe'elam\" is sometimes Hebrew, sometimes Aramaic, and sometimes both mixed. Unlike the body of the \"Zohar\", its \"drashot\" are short and not long. Also, the topics it discusses\u2014the work of Creation, the nature of the soul, the days of Mashiach, and \"Olam Haba\"\u2014are not of the type found in the \"Zohar\", which are the nature of God, the emanation of worlds, the \"forces\" of evil, and more.\ns. Mystic Midrash on Ruth\nA commentary on the Book of Ruth in the same style.\nt. Faithful Shepherd (\u05e8\u05e2\u05d9\u05d0 \u05de\u05d4\u05d9\u05de\u05e0\u05d0)\nBy far the largest \"book\" included in the \"Zohar\", this is a Kabbalistic commentary on Moses' teachings revealed to ben Yochai and his friends. Moshe Cordovero said, \"Know that this book, which is called \"Ra'aya Meheimna\", which ben Yochai made with the tzadikim who are in Gan Eden, was a repair of the Shekhinah, and an aid and support for it in the exile, for there is no aid or support for the Shekhinah besides the secrets of the Torah... And everything that he says here of the secrets and the concepts\u2014it is all with the intention of unifying the Shekhinah and aiding it during the exile.\nu. Rectifications of the Zohar (\u05ea\u05e7\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d6\u05d5\u05d4\u05e8)\n\"Tikunei haZohar\", which was printed as a separate book, includes seventy commentaries called \"Tikunim\" (lit.\u2009'Repairs') and an additional eleven \"Tikunim\". In some editions, \"Tikunim\" are printed that were already printed in the \"Zohar Chadash\", which in their content and style also pertain to \"Tikunei haZohar\".\nEach of the seventy \"Tikunim\" of \"Tikunei haZohar\" begins by explaining the word \"Bereshit\" (\u05d1\u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d9\u05ea), and continues by explaining other verses, mainly in \"parashat Bereshit\", and also from the rest of Tanakh. And all this is in the way of \"Sod\", in commentaries that reveal the hidden and mystical aspects of the Torah.\n\"Tikunei haZohar\" and \"Ra'aya Meheimna\" are similar in style, language, and concepts, and are different from the rest of the \"Zohar\". For example, the idea of the Four Worlds is found in \"Tikunei haZohar\" and \"Ra'aya Meheimna\" but not elsewhere, as is true of the very use of the term \"Kabbalah\". In terminology, what is called Kabbalah in \"Tikunei haZohar\" and \"Ra'aya Meheimna\" is simply called \"razin\" (clues or hints) in the rest of the \"Zohar\". In \"Tikunei haZohar\" there are many references to \"chibura kadma'ah\" (meaning \"the earlier book\"). This refers to the main body of the \"Zohar\".\nv. Further Additions\nThese include later \"Tikkunim\" and other texts in the same style.\nInfluence.\nJudaism.\nOn the one hand, the \"Zohar\" was lauded by many rabbis because it opposed religious formalism, stimulated one's imagination and emotions, and for many people helped reinvigorate the experience of prayer. In many places prayer had become a mere external religious exercise, while prayer was supposed to be a means of transcending earthly affairs and placing oneself in union with God.\nAccording to the \"Jewish Encyclopedia\", \"On the other hand, the Zohar was censured by many rabbis because it propagated many superstitious beliefs, and produced a host of mystical dreamers, whose overexcited imaginations peopled the world with spirits, demons, and all kinds of good and bad influences.\" Many classical rabbis, especially Maimonides, viewed all such beliefs as a violation of Jewish principles of faith. Its mystic mode of explaining some commandments was applied by its commentators to all religious observances, and produced a strong tendency to substitute mystic Judaism in the place of traditional Rabbinic Judaism. For example, Shabbat, the Jewish Sabbath, began to be looked upon as the embodiment of God in temporal life, and every ceremony performed on that day was considered to have an influence upon the superior world.\nElements of the \"Zohar\" crept into the liturgy of the 16th and 17th centuries, and the religious poets not only used the allegorism and symbolism of the \"Zohar\" in their compositions, but even adopted its style, e.g. the use of erotic terminology to illustrate the relations between man and God. Thus, in the language of some Jewish poets, the beloved one's curls indicate the mysteries of the Deity; sensuous pleasures, and especially intoxication, typify the highest degree of divine love as ecstatic contemplation; while the wine-room represents merely the state through which the human qualities merge or are exalted into those of God.\nThe \"Zohar\" is also credited with popularizing de Leon's PaRDeS codification of biblical exegesis.\nChristian mysticism.\nAccording to the \"Jewish Encyclopedia\", \"The enthusiasm felt for the Zohar was shared by many Christian scholars, such as Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, Johann Reuchlin, Aegidius of Viterbo, etc., all of whom believed that the book contained proofs of the truth of Christianity. They were led to this belief by the analogies existing between some of the teachings of the \"Zohar\" and certain Christian dogmas, such as the fall and redemption of man, and the dogma of the Trinity, which seems to be expressed in the \"Zohar\" in the following terms:\nThe Ancient of Days has three heads. He reveals himself in three archetypes, all three forming but one. He is thus symbolized by the number Three. They are revealed in one another. [These are:] first, secret, hidden 'Wisdom'; above that the Holy Ancient One; and above Him the Unknowable One. None knows what He contains; He is above all conception. He is therefore called for man 'Non-Existing' [\"Ayin\"] (Zohar, iii. 288b).\nAccording to the \"Jewish Encyclopedia\", \"This and other similar doctrines found in the Zohar are now known to be much older than Christianity, but the Christian scholars who were led by the similarity of these teachings to certain Christian dogmas deemed it their duty to propagate the Zohar.\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Zope stands for \"Z Object Publishing Environment\", and was the first system using the now common object publishing methodology for the Web. Zope has been called a Python killer app, an application that helped put Python in the spotlight.\nOver the last few years, the Zope community has spawned several additional web frameworks with disparate aims and principles, but sharing philosophy, people, and source code. Zope 2 is still the most widespread of these frameworks, largely thanks to the Plone content management system, which runs on Zope 2. BlueBream (earlier called Zope 3) is less widespread but underlies several large sites, including Launchpad. Grok was started as a more programmer-friendly framework, \"Zope 3 for cavemen\", and in 2009 Pyramid gained popularity in the Zope community as a minimalistic framework based on Zope principles.\nHistory.\nThe Zope Corporation was formed in 1995 in Fredericksburg, Virginia under the name Digital Creations, as a joint venture with InfiNet (a joint newspaper chain venture). The company developed a classified advertisement engine for the Internet. In 1997, the company became independently owned and private. The company's software engineers are led by CTO Jim Fulton. PythonLabs, creators of Python, became part of the company in 2000 (Python founder Guido van Rossum left Zope Corp in 2003).\nWhat is now known as Zope 2 began with the merging of three separate software products \u2013 Bobo, Document Template, and BoboPOS \u2013 into the Principia application server. At the behest of its largest investor, Opticality Ventures, Principia was re-released as free software under the name Zope in 1998. Bobo, and therefore Zope, was the first Web object publishing solution.\nIn November 2004, Zope 3 was released. Zope 3 is a complete rewrite that preserves only the original ZODB object database. It is directly intended for enterprise Web application development using the newest development paradigms. Zope 3 is, however, not compatible with Zope 2, so Zope 2 applications do not run on Zope 3. It was originally intended to introduce a backwards-compatibility layer so that Zope 2 software would run on Zope 3. Instead a module known as Five introduced the new Zope 3 paradigms into Zope 2, although full compatibility isn't possible that way either.\nThe existence of two incompatible Web frameworks called Zope has caused a lot of confusion. In response, in January 2010, Zope 3 was renamed \"BlueBream\". \"Zope\" and \"blue bream\" are names of a kind of fish, Ballerus ballerus.\nZope Foundation.\nThe Zope Foundation is an organization that promotes the development of the Zope platform by supporting the community that develops and maintains the relevant software components. The community includes both open source software, documentation and web infrastructure contributors, as well as business and organization consumers of the software platform. It manages the zope.org websites, an infrastructure for open source collaboration.\nZope versions.\nZope 2.\nA Zope website is usually composed of objects in a Zope Object Database, not files on a file system, as is usual with most web servers. This allows users to harness the advantages of object technologies, such as encapsulation. Zope maps URLs to objects using the containment hierarchy of such objects; methods are considered to be contained in their objects as well. Data can be stored in other databases as well, or on the file system, but ZODB is the most common solution.\nZope provides two mechanisms for HTML templating: Document Template Markup Language (DTML) and Zope Page Templates (ZPT). DTML is a tag-based language that allows implementation of simple scripting in the templates. DTML has provisions for variable inclusion, conditions, and loops. However, DTML can be problematic: DTML tags interspersed with HTML form non-valid HTML documents, and its use requires care when including logic into templates, to retain code readability. The use of DTML is discouraged by many leading Zope developers. ZPT is a technology that addresses the shortcomings of DTML. ZPT templates can be either well-formed XML documents or HTML documents, in which all special markup is presented as attributes in the TAL (Template Attribute Language) namespace. ZPT offers a very limited set of tools for conditional inclusion and repetition of XML elements. Consequently, the templates are usually quite simple, with most logic implemented in Python code. One significant advantage of ZPT templates is that they can be edited in most graphical HTML editors. ZPT also offers direct support for internationalization.\nZope 2 underlies the Plone content management system, as well as the ERP5 open source enterprise resource planning system.\nBlueBream.\nBlueBream is a rewrite by the Zope developers of the Zope 2 web application server. It was created under the name \"Zope 3\", but the existence of two incompatible frameworks with the same name caused much confusion, and Zope 3 was renamed \"BlueBream\" in January 2010. BlueBream is distributed under the terms of the Zope Public License and is thus free software.\nZope 2 has proven itself as a useful framework for Web applications development, but its use revealed some shortcomings. To name a few, creating Zope 2 products involves copying a lot of boilerplate code \u2013 \"magic\" code \u2013 that just has to be there, and the built-in management interface is difficult to modify or replace. Zope 3 was a rewrite of the software that attempts to address these shortcomings while retaining the advantages of Zope that led to its popularity. BlueBream is based on a component architecture that makes it easy to mix software components of various origins written in Python. Although originally intended as a replacement for Zope 2, the Zope Component Architecture has instead been backported to Zope 2, starting with Zope 2.8. Many Zope platforms such as Plone are going through the same type of piece-by-piece rewriting. The first production release of the new software, Zope X3 3.0.0, was released on November 6, 2004.\nHistory.\nThe Zope 3 project started in February 2001 as an effort to develop a new version of Zope as an almost complete rewrite, with the goal to retain the successful features of Zope 2 while trying to fix some of its shortcomings. The goal was to create a more developer-friendly and flexible platform for programming web applications than Zope 2 is. The project began with the development of a component architecture, which allows the structuring of code into small, composable units with introspectable interfaces. The interfaces are supported by an interface package in order to provide the functionality of explicitly declared interfaces to the Python language. The first production release of the software, Zope X3, was released on November 6, 2004. In January 2010 Zope 3 was renamed BlueBream.\nTechnology.\nThe goal of the project was to enable programmers to use Zope in order to expose arbitrary Python objects as model objects to the web without the need to make these objects fulfill particular behavior requirements. In Zope 2 there had been many behavior requirements to allow objects to participate in the framework, which resulted in a large amount of mixin base classes and special attributes. BlueBream uses a model/view architecture, separating the presentation code from the problem domain code. Views and models are linked together by the component architecture.\nThe libraries underlying BlueBream have been evolving into a collection of useful libraries for web application development rather than a single, monolithic application server. BlueBream includes separate packages for interfaces, component architecture, HTTP server, publisher, Zope Object Database (ZODB), Zope Page Templates, I18N, security policy, and so on. The component architecture is used to glue these together. The component architecture is configured using a ZCML (Zope Configuration Markup Language), an XML based configuration file language.\nThe Zope 3 project pioneered the practice of sprints for open source software development. Sprints are intensive development sessions when programmers, often from different countries, gather in one room and work together for a couple of days or even several weeks. During the sprints various practices drawn from agile software development are used, such as pair programming and test-driven development. Besides the goal of developing software, sprints are also useful for geographically separated developers to meet in person and attracting new people to the project. They also serve as a way for the participants to learn from each other.\nBlueBream is considered a stable framework, used on production projects worldwide, most notably Launchpad.\nZope Toolkit.\nAs a result of the development of Zope 3 / BlueBream, there are now many independent Python packages used and developed as a part of BlueBream, and although many of these are usable outside of BlueBream, many are not. The Zope Toolkit (ZTK) project was started to clarify which packages were usable outside BlueBream, and to improve the re-usability of the packages. Thus the Zope Toolkit is a base for the Zope frameworks. Zope 2.12 is the first release of a web framework that builds on Zope Toolkit, and Grok and BlueBream were set to have releases based on the ZTK during 2010.\nGrok.\nIn 2006 the Grok project was started by a number of Zope 3 developers who wanted to make Zope 3 technology more agile in use and more accessible to newcomers. Grok has since then seen regular releases and its core technology (Martian, grokcore.component) is also finding uptake in other Zope 3 and Zope 2 based projects.\nZope 4.\nIn late 2017, development began on Zope 4. Zope 4 is a successor to Zope 2.13, making many changes that are not backwards compatible with Zope 2.\nZope 5.\nZope 5 was released in 2020.\nZope page templates.\nAs mentioned previously, Zope page templates are themselves XHTML documents, which means they can be viewed and edited using normal HTML editors or XHTML compliant tools (a big advantage compared to other template languages used for Web applications). Templates can also be checked for XHTML compliance so you can be fairly confident that they will automatically expand into proper XHTML.\nHowever, these page templates are not meant to be rendered as is. Instead they are marked up with additional elements and attributes in special XML namespaces (see below). This additional information is used to describe how the page template should ultimately be processed.\nHere are some basic examples. To conditionally include a particular element, like a codice_1 element, simply add the codice_2 attribute to the element as follows:\n&lt;div tal:condition=\"...\"&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\nTo control what appears inside an element, use the codice_3 attribute like this:\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span tal:content=\"...\"/&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\nFinally, to introduce or replace values of attributes use the codice_4 attribute as below. You can use Python to alter the href at runtime.\n&lt;a href=\"\" tal:attributes=\"href python:'http://someurl.com/%s'%someobject\"&gt;...&lt;/a&gt;\nThis is a very cursory explanation of Zope Page Templates. The behavior of Zope Page Templates is almost completely described by a template language, fixed on TAL, TALES, and METAL specifications:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Each combatant is armed with two long sticks, one of which is used for defense and the other for offense. Little armor is used. For up to five hours, players alternate between offense and defense to score points based on which body part is struck.\nAlthough Nguni/Xhosa styles of fighting may use only two sticks, variations of Bantu/Nguni stick-fighting throughout Southern Africa incorporate shields as part of the stick-fighting weaponry. Zulu stick-fighting uses an \"isikhwili\" or attacking stick, an \"ubhoko\" or defending stick and an \"ihawu\" or defending shield. \nThe object is for two opposing warriors to fight each other to establish which of them is the strongest or the \"Bull\" (Inkunzi). In modern times this usually occurs as part of the wedding ceremony where warriors from the bridegroom's household and area welcome warriors from the bride's household and area to meet to \"get to know each other\", other groups of warriors may also be welcome to join in. Warriors do this by engaging in combat with one another. An \"induna\" or War Captain / Referee from each group of warriors keeps his crew in check and keeps order between fighters. \nThis tradition is one which arguably developed in societies, cultures and civilisations that used herding as part of their systems of survival; where there are cows, there are stick-fighters. The old regimental structures of the great uShaka KaSenzangakhona KaJama dominate current modern Zulu stick-fighting.\nFilm maker SiyaBonga Makhathini has directed the film \"We Still are Warriors\" which captures the essence of the modern-day Zulu stick-fighter, descendant of the kings of old. \nNelson Mandela practiced Nguni stick-fighting as a child, and it was featured on the Discovery and BBC reality TV show \"Last Man Standing\".

{"id": "34475", "revid": "32990417", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34475", "title": "ZX81", "text": "1981 home computer\nThe ZX81 is a home computer developed by Sinclair Research and manufactured in Dundee, Scotland, by Timex Corporation. It was launched in the United Kingdom in March 1981 as the successor to Sinclair's ZX80 and designed to be a low-cost introduction to home computing for the general public. It was hugely successful; more than 1.5\u00a0million units were sold. In the United States it was initially sold as the ZX-81 under licence by Timex. Timex later produced its own versions of the ZX81: the Timex Sinclair 1000 and Timex Sinclair 1500. Unauthorized ZX81 clones were produced in several countries.\nThe ZX81 was designed to be small, simple, and above all, inexpensive. Video output is for a television set rather than a dedicated monitor. It contains only four silicon chips and 1\u00a0KB of RAM. It has no power switch or moving parts, excepting a VHF TV channel selector switch in some models. It has a pressure-sensitive membrane keyboard. Programs and data are loaded and saved onto compact audio cassettes. The ZX81's limitations prompted a market in third-party peripherals to improve its capabilities. Its distinctive case and keyboard brought designer Rick Dickinson a Design Council award.\nThe ZX81 could be bought by mail order preassembled or, for a lower price, in kit form. It was the first inexpensive mass-market home computer to be sold by high street stores, led by W. H. Smith and soon many other retailers. The ZX81 marked the point when computing in Britain became an activity for the general public rather than businessmen and electronics hobbyists. It produced a community of enthusiasts, some of whom founded businesses developing software and hardware for the ZX81. Many went on to have roles in the British computer industry. The ZX81's commercial success made Sinclair Research one of Britain's leading computer manufacturers and earned a fortune and an eventual knighthood for the company's founder, Sir Clive Sinclair. The system was discontinued in 1984.\nFeatures.\nThe ZX81 has a base configuration of 1\u00a0KB of on-board RAM that can officially be expanded externally to 16\u00a0KB. Its single circuit board is housed inside a wedge-shaped plastic case measuring wide by high. The memory is provided by either a single 4118 (1024 bit \u00d7 8) or two 2114 (1024 bit \u00d7 4) RAM chips. There are only three other onboard chips: a 3.5\u00a0MHz Z80A 8-bit microprocessor from NEC, an uncommitted logic array (ULA) chip from Ferranti, and an 8\u00a0KB ROM providing a simple Sinclair BASIC interpreter. The entire machine weighs just . Early versions of the external RAM cartridge contain 15\u00a0KB of memory using an assortment of memory chips, while later versions contain 16\u00a0KB chips with the lowest addressed kilobyte disabled.\nThe front part of the case is an integrated 40-key membrane keyboard. It is mechanically simple, consisting of 40\u00a0pressure-pad switches and 8 diodes under a plastic overlay, connected in a matrix of 8 rows and 5 columns.\nThe ZX81 uses a QWERTY keyboard layout displaying 20\u00a0graphic and 54\u00a0inverse video characters. However ZX81 BASIC commands are not typed in letter by letter, instead each key has up to five key functions. This is how the user displays the ZX81's BASIC keywords, functions, mathematical operations, and graphics.\nThe ZX81 key's function is determined by a combination of context in the command and mode selection e.g. codice_1 and codice_2 keys to select the under key keyboard functions. For example, the P key combines the letter codice_3, the codice_4 character, and the BASIC commands codice_5 and codice_6.\nContext mode feedback is displayed by the cursor displaying an inverted letter;\nThe fact that to effect a codice_11 or backspace/delete operation took 2 key presses encouraged ZX81 programmers to be brief and type carefully when entering text or code.\nThe ZX81's primary input/output is delivered via four sockets on the left side of the case. The machine uses an ordinary UHF television set to deliver a monochrome picture via a built-in RF modulator. It can display 24 lines of 32 characters each, and by using the selection of 2\u00d72 block character graphics from the machine's character set offers an effective 64 \u00d7 44 pixel graphics mode, also directly addressable via BASIC using the PLOT and UNPLOT commands, leaving 2 lines free at the bottom. Two 3.5\u00a0mm jacks connect the ZX81 to the EAR (output) and MIC (input) sockets of an audio cassette recorder, enabling data to be saved or loaded. This stores each data bit as a number of pulses followed by an inter-bit silence of 1300 \u03bcs. Each pulse is a 150 \u03bcs \"high\" then a 150 \u03bcs \"low\". A \"0\" bit consists of four pulses while a '1' bit is nine pulses, so the baud rate varies between 400 bit/s for all \"0\"s and 250 bit/s for all \"1\"s. A file with equal amounts of '0's and \"1\"s would be stored at 307 bit/s (38 B/s). This provides a somewhat temperamental storage medium for the machine, which has no built-in storage capabilities. The ZX81 requires 420 mA of current at 7\u201311 V DC, delivered via a custom 9 V Sinclair DC power supply.\nThe ULA chip, described by the ZX81 manual as the \"dogsbody\" of the system, has a number of key functions that competing computers share between multiple chips and integrated circuits. These comprise the following:\nThe ZX81's built-in RF modulator can output a video picture to a UHF 625-line television (used in the UK, Australia, and most western European countries). France and Luxembourg required a slightly modified version of the machine to match the positive video modulation of CCIR System L sets, while the United States and Canada required a resistor adding to link a ULA pin to ground and different modulator to cope with their 525-line VHF (NTSC) television systems. Both the ZX81 and its predecessor, the ZX80, have a significant drawback in the way that they handle visual output. Neither machine has enough processing power to run at full speed and simultaneously maintain the screen display. On the ZX80, this means that the screen goes blank every time the machine carries out a computation and causes an irritating flicker whenever a shorter computation \u2013 such as processing a keystroke \u2013 takes place.\nThe ZX81's designers adopted an improved approach, involving the use of two modes called SLOW and FAST respectively. In SLOW mode, also called \"compute and display\" mode, the ZX81 concentrates on driving the display. It runs the current program for only about a quarter of the time \u2013 in effect slowing the machine down fourfold, although in practice the speed difference between FAST and SLOW modes depends on what computation is being done. In FAST mode, processing occurs continuously, but the display is abandoned to its own devices \u2013 equivalent to the ZX80's standard operating mode.\nAnother hardware quirk produced one of the most distinctive aspects of the ZX81's screen display \u2013 during loading or saving, moving zigzag stripes appear across the screen. The same pin on the ULA is used to handle the video signal and the tape output, producing the stripes as an interference pattern of sorts. The ULA cannot maintain the display during SAVE and LOAD operations, as it has to operate continuously to maintain the correct baud rate for data transfers. The interference produces the zigzag stripes.\nThe unexpanded ZX81's tiny memory presents a challenge to programmers. Simply displaying a full screen takes up to 793\u00a0bytes, the system variables take up another 125\u00a0bytes, and the program, input buffer and stacks need more memory on top of that. Nonetheless, ingenious programmers are able to achieve a surprising amount with just 1\u00a0KB. One example is \"1K ZX Chess\" by David Horne, which includes most of the rules of chess in 672 bytes. The ZX81 conserves its memory to a certain extent by representing entire BASIC commands as one-byte tokens, stored as individual \"characters\" in the upper reaches of the machine's unique (non-ASCII) character set.\nThe edge connector or external interface at the rear of the ZX81 is an extension of the main printed circuit board. This provides a set of address, control, and data lines that can be used to communicate with external devices. Enthusiasts and a variety of third-party companies make use of this facility to create a wide range of add-ons for the ZX81.\nComparisons with other computing devices.\nThe following table provides a comparison between the capabilities of the ZX81 and various other competing microcomputers that were available in June 1981, about the time that the first ZX81 orders were delivered. The prices given are as of June 1981 from Your Computer UK.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Sort under/styles.css\" /&gt;\nN.B.: The PET includes monitor and cassette recorder. The Video Genie includes a built-in cassette recorder. The Compukit 101 is an Ohio Scientific SuperBoard made under licence in Britain. The Compukit 101 and MicroTan are kit computers and are not supplied with a case.\nThe Atari 400 and TRS-80 model I were officially only expandable to 16\u00a0KB, but expansion to 48\u00a0KB was available from third-party suppliers.\nThe ZX81 and the other systems referred to as having \"block\" graphics have a resolution of 256\u00a0\u00d7 192 pixels, there are 32 columns\u00a0\u00d7 22 rows of text and graphics can be addressed in quarter character blocks.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nClive Sinclair, a former radio kit salesman, established his first company, Sinclair Radionics, in 1962. The company made its name producing a wide range of cheap electronics aimed at the hobbyist market. Its products include amplifiers, radios, multimeters and other items which were generally sold in kit form to hi-fi enthusiasts and other electronics hobbyists. The company entered a new market in 1972 when it launched the first \"slimline\" pocket calculator, the Sinclair Executive. Radionics followed up by launching a wide range of pocket calculators. The company's subsequent expansion made it Europe's biggest calculator manufacturer by 1975.\nBy the late 1970s, however, Sinclair Radionics was experiencing serious difficulties. It lost its ability to compete effectively in the calculator market following the launch of a new generation of Japanese-produced calculators with liquid-crystal displays, which were much more capable and power-efficient than Sinclair's LED calculators. Projects to develop a pocket television and digital watch turned out to be expensive failures. The company made losses of more than \u00a3350,000 in 1975\u201376, bringing it to the edge of bankruptcy. In July 1977 Radionics was rescued by a state agency, the National Enterprise Board (NEB), which recapitalised it, provided a loan facility and took effective control of the company by acquiring a 73% stake.\nClive Sinclair's relationship with the NEB was fraught due to conflicting notions about which direction the company should go. Radionics had begun a project to develop a home computer but the NEB wanted to concentrate on the instrument side of the business, which was virtually the only area where Radionics was profitable. Sinclair disagreed vehemently with what he characterised as the view \"that there was no future in consumer electronics\". This and other disputes led to Sinclair resigning from Radionics in July 1979.\nWhile he was struggling with the NEB, Clive Sinclair turned to a \"corporate lifeboat\" in the shape of an existing corporate shell under his exclusive control \u2013 a company called Ablesdeal Ltd, which he had established in 1973 and later renamed Science of Cambridge. It became a vehicle through which he could pursue his own projects, free of the interference of the NEB. Despite his later success in the field, Sinclair saw computers as merely a means to an end. As he told the \"Sunday Times\" in April 1985, \"We only got involved in computers in order to fund the rest of the business\", specifically the development of the ultimately unsuccessful TV80 pocket television and C5 electric vehicle. In an interview with \"Practical Computing\", Sinclair explained:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I make computers because they are a good market, and they are interesting to design. I don't feel bad about making them or selling them for money or anything, there is a demand for them and they do no harm; but I don't think they are going to save the world.\nPrecursors: the MK14 and ZX80.\nBy the late 1970s, American companies were producing simple home computer kits such as the MITS Altair and IMSAI 8080. This aroused interest among electronics hobbyists in the UK but relatively high prices and lower disposable income reduced the appeal of the American products. \"New Scientist\" stated in 1977 that \"the price of an American kit in dollars rapidly translates into the same figure in pounds sterling by the time it has reached the shores of Britain\". Off-the-shelf personal computers were also available for the high end of the market but were extremely expensive; Olivetti's offering cost \u00a32,000, and the Commodore PET, launched in 1979, sold for \u00a3700. There was nothing for the hobbyist at the low end of the market. Sinclair realised that this provided a useful commercial opportunity.\nSinclair's first home computer was the MK14, which was launched in kit form in June 1978. It was a long way from being a mass-market product. Its very name \u2013 MK standing for \"Microcomputer Kit\" \u2013 was indicative of its origins as a product developed by, and for, hobbyists.\nIt had no screen but instead used an LED segment display (though Science of Cambridge did produce an add-on module allowing it to be hooked up to a UHF TV); it had no case, consisting of an exposed circuit board; it had no built-in storage capabilities and only 256 bytes of memory; and input was via a 20-key hexadecimal keyboard.\nDespite the limitations of the machine it sold a respectable 10\u201315,000 units; by comparison, the much more expensive Apple II had only sold 9,000 units in the United States, a much bigger market, in 1978. This success convinced Clive Sinclair that there was an untapped market for low-cost computers that could profitably be exploited.\nSinclair followed up the MK14 by producing the ZX80, at the time the world's smallest and cheapest computer, which was launched in January 1980 costing \u00a399.95 (equivalent to \u00a3390 at 2021 prices.) The company conducted no market research whatsoever prior to the launch of the ZX80; according to Clive Sinclair, he \"simply had a hunch\" that the general public was sufficiently interested to make such a project feasible and went ahead with ordering 100,000 sets of parts so that he could launch at high volume.\nThe ZX80's design introduced many key features that were carried over to the ZX81; as Sinclair himself later said, \"the ZX80 was very much a stepping stone to the ZX81\". The design was driven entirely by the desired price \u2013 the machine had to cost less than \u00a3100 but still make a healthy profit. Its distinctive wedge-shaped white case concealing the circuitry and the touch-sensitive membrane keyboard were the brainchild of Rick Dickinson, a young British industrial designer who had recently been hired by Sinclair. As he later recalled of Sinclair's approach, \"Everything was cost driven. The design was the face of the machine.\" The unconventional keyboard was the outcome of Sinclair's cost-cutting. It made use of a sheet of plastic, on which the keys were printed, overlaying a metallic circuit that registered when a key was pressed. This avoided the expense of providing a typewriter-style keyboard, though the design had many drawbacks when it came to usability and \"feel\".\nInside the case, there were many more similarities with the ZX81. Like its successor, it used the Z80A microprocessor and had only 1\u00a0KB of on-board RAM. It came with a specially written BASIC interpreter on a dedicated ROM chip and could use a television as a display. It relied on an ordinary cassette tape recorder for data storage. The main difference between the two machines lay in the internal software; when the ZX81 was released, ZX80 owners were able to upgrade by the relatively simple expedient of plugging a new ROM onto the circuit board.\nThe ZX80 was an immediate success, selling 20,000 units over the following nine months. Science of Cambridge was producing ZX80s at the rate of 9,000 a month by the end of 1980 and within 18 months of its launch the company had sold 100,000 units. The commercial success of the ZX80 made a follow-up product inevitable. The company was renamed Sinclair Computers in November 1980, reflecting its new focus, and became Sinclair Research in March 1981.\nBBC Micro bid.\nThe launch of the ZX81 was catalysed in part by the BBC Computer Literacy Project's plan to produce The Computer Programme TV series, to be broadcast in 1982, aimed at popularising computing and programming. The BBC intended to commission an existing manufacturer to provide it with a BBC-branded home computer to tie in with the series. When Clive Sinclair heard of the project in December 1980, he wrote to the BBC informing them that he would be announcing a new version of the ZX80, to be called the ZX81, in early 1981. It would remedy some of the ZX80's deficiencies and would be both cheaper and more advanced. Sinclair wanted the ZX81 to be a candidate for the BBC contract and lobbied for its adoption. He pointed out that there were already 40,000 users of the ZX80 and that by the time the series was broadcast there were likely to be upwards of 100,000 ZX81 users.\nA prototype ZX81 was demonstrated to BBC representatives in January 1981, while Sinclair's local rival Acorn Computers put forward their proposed Proton computer, a design \u2013 of which a prototype did not yet exist \u2013 based on the Acorn Atom. To Sinclair's dismay, the contract to produce the BBC Micro went to Acorn, which launched the machine in January 1982. Paul Kriwaczek, the producer of \"The Computer Programme\", explained his reservations in a March 1982 interview with \"Your Computer:\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I would have been very reluctant for the BBC to sell something like the Sinclair [ZX81] because it is so limited. The Sinclair cannot be expanded; it is fundamentally a throw-away consumer product. Its usefulness lies in learning about programming, but I do not believe that the future of computers lies in everyone learning to program in BASIC.\nSinclair was critical of the BBC's decision, accusing it of incompetence and arrogance. Shortly after Acorn won the BBC contract the Government issued a recommended list of computers, including the BBC Micro and Research Machines 380Z, that schools could purchase, with the aid of a grant, for half price; Sinclair's computers were not included on the list. Sinclair responded by launching his own half-price deal, offering schools the chance to buy a ZX81 and 16\u00a0KB RAM pack for \u00a360, plus a ZX Printer at half price, for a total cost of \u00a390. As the cheapest Government-approved system was \u00a3130, this was an attractive offer for some schools and about 2,300 bought Sinclair's package, although 85% adopted the BBC Micro.\nDevelopment and manufacture.\nThe development of the ZX81 got under way even before the ZX80 had been launched. Sinclair's chief engineer, Jim Westwood, was given the task of improving the ZX80's hardware to reduce the number of components and thus bring down the cost. He also sought to fix some of the more annoying problems with the ZX80. Westwood and his colleagues found that the component count could be reduced greatly by combining eighteen of the ZX80's chips into a single uncommitted logic array (ULA), a type of general-purpose chip full of logic gates that were connected up as the customer required during chip manufacture. This short-lived technology of the day was cheaper and quicker than the design of a customised logic chip, which typically required very high volumes to recoup its development cost. Ferranti produced the new chip for Sinclair, who hailed Westwood's design as a triumph of innovation: \"The ZX81 had four chips when our nearest competitor in this respect, the TRS-80, had 44.\" Only 70% of the logic gates on the ULA were supposed to be used, but Sinclair decided to use them all to squeeze more functions in. This resulted in the machine becoming uncomfortably warm during usage. Computing folklore held that the ZX81 had to be refrigerated by balancing a carton of cold milk on top of the case.\nThe ZX81's ROM was doubled to 8\u00a0KB, from the ZX80's 4\u00a0KB ROM. This enabled a fuller implementation of a version of ANSI Minimal BASIC (termed Sinclair BASIC by the company). Clive Sinclair re-commissioned a company called Nine Tiles, which had produced the ZX80 ROM, to develop the new ROM software for the ZX81. The code was written by John Grant, the owner of Nine Tiles, and Steve Vickers, who had joined the company in January 1980. Grant concentrated on the software that drove the ZX81's hardware, while Vickers developed the new BASIC and the accompanying manual. Sinclair's brief to the pair was fairly non-specific but primarily concerned remedying a key defect of the ZX80 so that the new machine could be used for practical programming and calculations. Vickers later recalled:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;As far as Clive was concerned, it wasn't a question of what the machine ought to be able to do, but more what could be crammed into the machine given the component budget he'd set his mind on. The only firm brief for the '81 was that the '80s math package must be improved.\nThe new ROM incorporated trigonometric and floating-point functions, which its predecessor had lacked \u2013 the ZX80 could only deal with whole numbers. Grant came up with one of the ZX81's more novel features, a syntax checker that indicated errors in BASIC code as soon as it was entered (rather than, as was standard at the time, only disclosing coding errors when a program was run). Unfortunately for Vickers, he introduced a briefly notorious error \u2013 the so-called \"square-root bug\" that caused the square root of 0.25 to be returned erroneously as 1.3591409 \u2013 as a result of problems with integrating the ZX Printer code into the ROM. Although it was eventually fixed, the bug became the subject of controversy and Sinclair was forced to replace some of the ZX81s sold to early customers. On a more positive note, Vickers' work on the manual was received favourably, being described in 1983 as \"one of the classic texts on BASIC\". Max Phillips commented in a \"What Micro?\" retrospective:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It does a reasonable job and sensibly provides lots for the reader to do. It's quite honest about the [ZX81]'s shortcomings and provides hints and tips for ways round them ... Best of all, the manual is complete and comprehensive. There's some fairly advanced and often undisclosed information in there. The beginner won't understand it for a long time but if he or she learns some more advanced ideas, the manual is ready for them.\nThe task of designing the ZX81's case again fell to Rick Dickinson, who produced an updated version of the ZX80's wedge-shaped case. This time round, the design team were able to use injection moulding, which enabled them to deliver a higher-quality case. Dickinson originally envisaged the ZX81 as \"an expandable range of boxes following a vaguely modular approach with a common width\", though this approach was eventually dropped. From start to finish, the design process took about six months.\nThe ZX81 was launched on 5 March 1981 in two versions (though with identical components) \u2013 a pre-assembled machine or a cheaper kit version, which the user could assemble themself. Both versions were manufactured in Dundee, Scotland by Timex Corporation at the company's Dryburgh factory. Timex had not been an obvious choice of manufacturing subcontractor, as the company had little previous experience in assembling electronics. It was a well-established manufacturer of mechanical watches but was facing a crisis at the beginning of the 1980s. Profits had dwindled to virtually zero as the market for mechanical watches stagnated in the face of competition from the digital and quartz watches. Recognising the trend, Timex's director, Fred Olsen, determined that the company would diversify into other areas of business.\nThis shift by Timex came at an ideal time for Sinclair. The ZX80 had proved more popular than expected and Sinclair's existing manufacturer, a small electronics company in St Ives, lacked the resources to deal with the demand. Timex took over production of the ZX80 late in 1980. The arrangement worked well for both companies and Timex took on the manufacture of the ZX81, aided by capital investment in its Dundee plant. Sinclair initially planned to produce 10,000 ZX81s a month, rising to 30,000 a month within a year. However, Timex initially had significant problems in producing enough ZX81s to satisfy demand. As a consequence, it took up to nine weeks for ZX81s to be delivered by mail order. It was not until September 1981, five months after the launch of the ZX81, that the delivery times finally came down to the promised twenty-eight days. Those who already owned or had recently ordered the ZX80 were not excluded; anyone who had ordered a ZX80 in the two weeks before the ZX81's launch would receive the newer machine, while existing owners were able to upgrade their ZX80s by plugging an extra \u00a320 ROM chip into the circuit board.\nThe reliability of the ZX81 was controversial. W.H. Smith, one of the machine's key distributors, had a company policy of ordering a third more ZX81s than were actually required for sale, so that it would have enough replacements for faulty machines. Similar problems were reported in the US market, where contemporary reports suggested that only a third of the ZX81s shipped actually worked. However, figures released by Sinclair claimed that only 2.4 per cent of pre-assembled machines were returned, although 13 per cent of kits were returned. Clive Sinclair strongly denied any problem with reliability:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSinclair attributed the higher failure rate of the kits to customers breaking the components by inserting or soldering them the wrong way, though the company admitted that there was a persistent problem with power supplies that affected both kits and pre-assembled ZX81s. The bigger problem was perhaps Sinclair's lack of after-sales service, which Robin Clarke of \"New Scientist\" described as \"one of the worst after-sales performance records of any company ever established\". The \"Financial Times\" observed that \"Clive Sinclair's offices are filled with returned computers which can take months to be repaired.\" The company's slowness in replacing returns and delivering freshly ordered machines meant that Sinclair Research gained a reputation for poor customer service.\nMarketing.\nThe marketing of the ZX81 was handled by Sinclair's long-standing marketing agency Primary Contact (now part of Ogilvy &amp; Mather), which had provided marketing services for Sinclair since 1971 and was to continue doing so until 1985. Sinclair's entry into the nascent home computing market gave Primary Contact a major challenge \u2013 how to market a product simultaneously at hobbyists and at the \"man on the street\", who probably had little or no computer literacy. The answer was to pursue what the journalist David O'Reilly of \"MicroScope\" magazine described as a single-minded \"user-friendly strategy\". Chris Fawkes, one of Primary Contact's directors, explained: \"We brought personal computers to the mass market by showing that you didn't have to be a whizzkid to use one.\" As Clive Sinclair put it in a 1982 interview with \"Your Computer\",\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAccording to Ben Rosen, by pricing the ZX81 so low, \"Sinclair has opened up a completely new market among people who had never previously considered owning a computer.\" Clive Sinclair acknowledged the role that guesswork had played in his decision to launch the ZX81 on such a large scale: \"It was a surmise that the man in the street would want such a computer. He does, and our information is that a lot of people are using the machines avidly.\" A \"New Scientist\" retrospective published in 1986 commented:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Sir Clive's marketing achievement was to downgrade the \"concept\" of a computer to the point where he could claim to provide one for less than the magical \u00a3100 mark. To this end, efficient keyboards and monitors, useful amounts of memory, efficient filing and storage systems and the like were stripped away, to leave an affordable facsimile of a \"computer\". The market image was more important than what the computer could do, but the burgeoning industry in computer games provided an application which adolescents \u2013 young and old \u2013 eagerly seized on as the for their new gadget. In the main, it was ignorance of genuine computer technology that fired the success of the ZX range, despite the availability of accessories that, albeit inefficiently, turned the Z80 processor chip at the heart of these up-market toys into the core of a useful machine.\nHigh-profile advertising was central to the marketing campaign. Although Sinclair Research was a relatively small company, it had a long-standing policy of using large-scale advertisements that stood out in stark contrast to the more muted advertisements of other manufacturers. Superlatives, exhortations, appeals to patriotism, testimonials, eye-catching drawings and photographs on double-page spreads, varying from month to month, were used to drum up mail order business for Sinclair. The launch advertising for the ZX81 illustrates this approach. A photograph of the ZX81 alongside the official Sinclair peripherals dominated the centre of a double-page spread. The value for money of Sinclair's products was emphasised by the prices being printed in larger type than any other text on the spread. The ZX81's benefits were promoted with the aspirational slogan \"Sinclair ZX81 Personal Computer \u2013 the heart of a system that grows with you\". The advertisement highlighted \"ZX81 BASIC Programming\", the manual written by Steve Vickers, as \"a complete course in BASIC programming, from first principles to complex programs\". The educational benefits of the ZX81 were stressed (\"it's still very simple to teach yourself computing\") and its technical advantages were explained in relatively non-technical terms. For instance, the ZX81's idiosyncratic method of typing commands with a single keystroke \u2013 the result of the memory-saving method of using one-byte tokens to represent keywords \u2013 was presented as \"eliminat[ing] a great deal of tiresome typing\". The ZX81's British character was emphasised; it was \"designed by Sinclair and custom-built in Britain\". Sinclair's advertising in the United States provides an illustration of how the company perceived the ZX81's purpose:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For less than $100, the Sinclair ZX81 will get you started in personal computing right now. Your children will gain an understanding of computers that will benefit them for the rest of their lives. And you will be prepared to make informed decisions about using and buying computers, both in your career and in your home.\nThis approach to advertising was driven by Sinclair's reliance on mail-order marketing. It came with a high up-front cost in terms of purchasing space in publications but it had the advantage of ensuring that all sales were firm and pre-paid. A big splash on launch produced a large influx of cash at the outset of a campaign, though it did also depend on the advertiser having enough product to satisfy the initial surge in demand. The advertisements served an additional purpose of priming the market for over-the-counter sales by \"getting the story across\", as Clive Sinclair put it: \"Not that big a proportion do buy on mail order, but they see the ads, and that helps to prepare them for buying when the item appears in the shops.\"\nSinclair himself became a focal point for the marketing campaign, putting a human face on the business, while Sinclair Research was portrayed in the media as a plucky British challenger taking on the technical and marketing might of giant American and Japanese corporations. As David O'Reilly noted, \"by astute use of public relations, particularly playing up his image of a Briton taking on the world, Sinclair has become the best-known name in micros.\" The popular press soon latched onto the image. His \"Uncle Clive\" persona is said to have been created by the gossip columnist for \"Personal Computer World\", while the media praised Sinclair as a visionary genius (or even, in the words of \"The Sun\", \"the most prodigious inventor since Leonardo\"). As Ian Adamson and Richard Kennedy put it, Sinclair outgrew \"the role of microcomputer manufacturer and accepted the mantle of pioneering boffin leading Britain into a technological utopia\".\nPricing was central to the marketing strategy, as it had been through Sinclair's career. The ZX81 had been designed to meet a \u00a370 price point and was launched at a price of \u00a369.95 (built) or \u00a349.95 (kit). One Sinclair brochure presented a side-by-side comparison of the ZX81 with the four machines that Sinclair considered its main rivals \u2013 the Acorn Atom, Apple II Plus, Commodore PET and TRS-80. The comparison highlighted the vast differences in cost, from \u00a3630 in the case of the Apple II Plus to just \u00a370 for the ZX81, though even by Sinclair's own comparison the Apple was by far the more capable machine.\nAccording to Sinclair himself, the \u00a369.95 price was chosen after applying the \"experience curve\" developed by the Boston Consulting Group. Sinclair's prior experience in the calculator market had highlighted the fact that a product will be more profitable selling at (for instance) twice the manufactured cost than at three times. He could have launched the ZX81 at a higher price, marketing it in a more traditional way as a premium product, but chose not to. In effect, he used the lower price to establish an unassailable lead before the competition moved in.\nAn essential part of Sinclair's marketing strategy was to use regular cost-cutting at strategic intervals to maintain market share. Ian Adamson and Richard Kennedy comment that Sinclair's approach was \"to secure and extend [his] market lead and panic the competition. While most companies reduce prices when their products are in steep decline, Sinclair tends to discount shortly after sales have peaked. The advantage of his approach is that vacillating customers are drawn into the fold while the product's promotion retains a commercial urgency, and the costings of the competition are thrown into utter disarray.\"\nThis tactic proved highly successful, with Sinclair announcing by March 1982 that it had sold 250,000 ZX81s worldwide. 50,000 computers were sold each month, 60% outside the UK, despite Sinclair and W. H. Smith being the only distributors. Despite the launch of its successor, the ZX Spectrum, Sinclair reportedly intended to increase ZX81 production to 150,000 a month. When sales fell after the Spectrum's debut, Sinclair reduced the price of the pre-assembled version to \u00a349.95 in May 1982. It was cut by another \u00a310 the following April. Despite the increased competition from much more capable computers, the ZX81 was still shipping in excess of 30,000 units a month even as late as July 1983, more than two years after it had been launched. By that time, according to Sinclair Research, over 1.5\u00a0million ZX81s had been sold.\nDistribution.\nThe ZX81's distribution arrangements were an essential part of its success and marked a watershed in the way that computers were sold in the UK. Sinclair had previously made its name as a mail-order retailer\u00a0\u2013 the ZX81 was initially available only through mail-order\u00a0\u2013 but the only truly effective way to reach the mass market was via high street stores. Fortunately for Sinclair, an opportunity to do just that was provided by W. H. Smith, a venerable book and magazine seller and stationery chain. The company had stagnated in the 1970s and was looking for ways to revitalise its image and expand its product range.\nSmith's had begun selling audio and photographic equipment and calculators at the end of the 1970s, with a modest degree of success. In 1980 its marketing development manager, John Rowland, hit upon the idea of creating \"Computer Know-How\" sections in major branches to sell computer books and magazines. Most of the items on display were imports from the United States but their relatively high cost reduced their attractiveness to the casual buyer. The commercial success and mass market potential of the ZX80 caught Rowland's interest; he approached Sinclair, saw a prototype ZX81 and agreed to market the machine through Smith's on an exclusive basis for the first six months after launch. As Rowland put it, \"what we've done now is bring the computer-orientated publications together with an actual computer, to create the Computer Know-How section of the store\", alongside computer software and blank cassette tapes. The ZX81 would be sold in 112 stores around the UK and would serve as the centrepiece of the \"Computer Know-How\" sections.\nSelling the ZX81 over the counter was seen as something of a gamble and Rowland's colleagues were initially unenthusiastic about the scheme. Branch buyers thought that the ZX81 was unlikely to sell more than 10\u201315 units per branch at launch. Rowland himself thought that the ZX81 would sell about 10,000 units during the first five months of the retail agreement, equivalent to one month's mail order sales by Sinclair. In the event, the ZX81 was a massive success for Smith's, it went on sale for \u00a3 making it the first home PC in the UK to retail for under \u00a3. The \"Computer Know-How\" sections were swamped with eager customers, overwhelming the 300 staff who had been trained to demonstrate the machines; a \"Financial Times\" correspondent wrote of being \"dazed and bewildered by the crowds of schoolchildren clustered round the ZX81 in your local branch of W. H. Smith\". Within a year, Smith's had sold 350,000 ZX81s, making an estimated net profit of \u00a3. Sales of peripherals, software, books and magazines netted even more profit.\nThe British chain stores Boots, John Menzies and Currys began selling the ZX81 as soon as Smith's exclusive distribution deal expired and a number of companies secured overseas distribution rights for the ZX81, which was being sold in 18 countries by March 1982. Sinclair launched the ZX81 in the United States in November 1981 at a price of $ assembled and $ in kit form, initially selling directly to the American market by mail order. To be useful the computer needed an extra RAM pack which cost $. Sales reached 15,000 a month by January 1982, while American Express sold thousands more to its own customers. In February 1982 Timex obtained a licence from Sinclair to sell the ZX81 directly through thousands of retail outlets in the US, paying Sinclair Research a 5 per cent royalty on all Sinclair hardware and software sold by Timex. The company was later to produce its own licensed clones and variants of the ZX81. By August 1982 Sinclair had lowered the American mail-order price of the assembled ZX81 to $ and kit to $, and its advertisements stated that \"more than 10,000 are sold every week\". In December 1981 Mitsui obtained rights to distribute the ZX81 in Japan, selling it by mail order for \u00a5 (equivalent to \u00a383 in 1982 prices), and had sold 5,000 units by July 1982. The Japanese market's favourable reaction to the ZX81 led Mitsui to begin selling the ZX81 over the counter in large bookshops from September 1982, with annual sales of 20,000 units predicted. In the Netherlands, the regular Sinclair ZX81 was for sale as well as a Bang &amp; Olufsen branded version called \"Beocomp\".\nThe ZX81 was also sold for a while in duty-free shops at UK airports. However, this fell foul of government export restrictions aimed at preventing the Soviet bloc countries from obtaining Western high technology goods. It was not uncommon for visitors from the Soviet Union and other eastern European countries to pick up gadgets in Western countries with the aim of transferring their technology to their own states' industries. In 1983 the government ordered that the ZX81s were to be withdrawn from sale at airports. There was no such restriction on sales to communist China and in November 1983 Sinclair Research announced that it had signed an agreement to export ZX81 kits to a factory in Guangzhou, where they would be assembled for the Chinese market.\nReception.\nReviews of the ZX81 highlighted the great value for money offered by the machine but noted its technical shortcomings. As Tim Hartnell put it in \"Your Computer\", \"the ZX81 is both a delight and a disappointment\". He applauded the improvements that had been made over the ZX80, such as a much better manual, display and string handling, and called the ZX81 \"a very good first computer\" that \"will open the world of computing to many who would be denied access to it by cost.\" However, the built-in memory was so small that use of a memory expansion pack was \"mandatory for any worthwhile use\". He also found the ZX81 to be alarmingly unreliable, having to have his first two test machines replaced before getting one that worked properly.\n\"New Scientist's\" Malcolm Peltu commented that it was \"great technical value for money particularly for computing enthusiasts\" but thought that others were \"likely to be bored very quickly by the basic system\". He highlighted weaknesses in the manual and Sinclair's accompanying software, criticising them for \"a misconceived design and sloppiness in execution which make the machine seem harder to use and more limited than it should\" and questioned whether it might be more worthwhile to save up for a more powerful computer such as Acorn or Commodore's offerings. Overall, he concluded, the ZX81 might have a limited value in helping to teach BASIC programming and overcoming psychological barriers to computing, but \"the Sinclair systems have a long way to go before they raise the quality and level of understanding of the nature and use of computer-based information systems among computer unbelievers.\"\nWhile the editor of \"Personal Computer World\" was on holiday in May 1981, his colleagues publicised the magazine's review of the ZX81 with a cover showing a chimpanzee with the machine above the strapline \"Editor benchtests the ZX81\". (The chimp returned in later issues to \"benchtest\" all of Sinclair's subsequent computers.) The review, which was written by \"PCW\" staffer Dave Tebbutt, acknowledged that the machine had significant shortcomings but nonetheless represented \"absolutely amazing value for money\". He described the ZX81 as \"a lovely product which will have enormous appeal to people wanting to find out more about computers, but without it costing them an arm and a leg\" and concluded: \"If you know nothing about computers and you want to enjoy finding out about them, then this machine offers a value for money way of doing just that. Children will love the ZX81, there can be no question about that, and I suspect that more than a few people who are already familiar with computers will buy one, just to have a bit of fun.\"\nPaul Taylor of the \"Financial Times\" found the ZX81 to be \"a powerful and flexible little computer ideally suited as a fun introduction to the mysteries of home computing\" but cautioned readers about its limitations. It lacked ready-made software, the keyboard was not easy to use, it did not have sufficiently advanced graphics to be able to replicate arcade-style games and its built-in memory was inadequate. Even so, he suggested, \"the ZX81 is a unique British product, part toy, part puzzle, part learning tool and I think that, provided one accepts its limitations and recognises that any computer will only do what it is told to do, it is good value as an introduction to the hobby of home computing.\"\n\"The Age\" described the ZX81 as \"not extremely sophisticated, and its memory capability is rather limited. It also has a rather toy-like appearance\". It concluded that the computer was \"an ideal toy for youngsters who want to become acquainted with the computer world. It is responsive, cheap, and very easy to use\".\nBilly Garrett of \"Byte\", who already owned a ZX80, complimented the Timex/Sinclair 1000's manual (although he regretted the removal of the British original's humour), the \"state-of-the-art circuitry\", and the BASIC for being \"remarkably powerful\" despite the small ROM size. He concluded that \"the major use\u00a0... will probably be for learning about BASIC or computers in general. [It] has limited expansion capabilities, and the keyboard is too small and cramped for any serious work\".\nPhillip Robinson of \"InfoWorld\" had no trouble using a $25 \"department-store special\" cassette recorder with his Timex/Sinclair 1000, but reported that friends could not use theirs. While also experiencing and having to compensate for the memory-expansion wobble, he stated his amazement at being able to purchase a complete computer with keyboard and BASIC \"at digital-watch prices\", approved of the documentation's quality, and surmised that Timex \"is obviously gunning for the computer-literacy market ... at a price the masses can afford and are willing to spend\". Robinson described the 1000's performance as \"no slouch\", especially its floating-point precision, and suggested using it as a single-purpose device devoted to one task while using another, larger computer.\nDavid Babsky described the ZX81 as \"a wonderfully brainy little micro which won't let you waste your time and make a fool of yourself\". In a comparison between the ZX81 and IBM PC published in \"Which Micro?\", he commended the ZX81's user-friendliness and its on-the-fly syntax checking of BASIC programs, which he described as \"the feature that I, as a newcomer to computing, want to see incorporated into every micro.\"\nPeripherals and software.\nThe success of the ZX81 led almost immediately to enthusiasts producing a huge variety of peripherals and software. Clive Sinclair was \"amused and gratified\" by the attention the machine received but other than what Clarke described as \"a few remarkably poor programs on cassette\", his company made little effort to exploit the demand, effectively ceding a very lucrative market to third party suppliers, a decision that undoubtedly forfeited a lot of potential earnings. W.\u00a0H. Smith, for instance, was able to exploit a peculiarity of the ZX81; owners found that technically obsolete low-fidelity mono tape cassette recorders worked better as storage devices than higher-quality music systems. Smith's purchased cheap \"shoebox\" cassette recorders in the Far East and sold them with the W.\u00a0H. Smith logo as \"data recorders\". Over 100,000 were sold in 18 months.\nSinclair released only two official peripherals for the ZX81, a 16\u00a0KB RAM pack (actually the same one previously released for the ZX80, but rebadged) and the ZX Printer, both of which plug into the edge connector at the rear of the ZX81. They retailed at a launch price of \u00a349.95 each but both have notable flaws. The RAM pack is top-heavy and supported only by the edge connector. It falls out of its socket at crucial points and crashes the ZX81, losing anything that the user has typed in. Users turned to using sticky lumps of chewing gum, double-sided tape, or Blu-Tack to cure what became known as the \"RAM pack wobble\" problem. The ZX Printer is a tiny spark printer that uses two electrically charged styli to burn away the surface of aluminium-coated paper to reveal the black underlay. It works reasonably well at first but its output deteriorates rapidly after a time.\nMany non-Sinclair peripherals aimed to remedy the ZX81's flaws and provide many new capabilities. These included RAM packs providing up to 64\u00a0KB of extra memory and promising to \"fit snugly\u00a0... giving a firm connection\" to the computer, typewriter-style keyboards, more advanced printers and sound generators. A wide range of software was also published. Within only a year of the ZX81's launch, around 200 independent companies had been established to manufacture and sell Sinclair-compatible hardware. The people behind the ZX81 cottage industry were very often not computer professionals but were, as the \"Financial Times\" noted, \"school teachers, civil servants, electrical engineers and technicians [who] have set up small operations in their own time\".\nThe ZX81's popularity was publicly demonstrated in January 1982 when civil servant Mike Johnstone organised a \"ZX Microfair\" at Westminster Central Hall. Seventy exhibitors set up stalls with only a few hundred visitors expected in a hall with a capacity of 650 people. Tens of thousands, mostly youths, came from around Britain, and the police had to control the crowd. They queued for three hours around the hall, with a group of 50 entering as another group left. About 12,000 entered the hall; Clarke, who was only able to enter after identifying himself as a journalist, wrote that \"no one knows how many gave up in despair\". The exhibitors sold thousands of pounds' worth of software and hardware \"as fast as three pairs of hands on each stall could hand them over and stuff the fivers into improvised overflowing cash boxes\", he added. The fair also showed Sinclair Research's relatively unimportant role in the computer's success, with only small crowds at its booth compared to the \"rugby scrum\" elsewhere. By August 1983 seven more ZX Microfairs were held, with the 14th ZX Microfair at Alexandra Palace in November 1984, still organised by Johnstone.\nThousands of ZX81 programs were published, either as type-in programs or as ready-made applications that could be loaded from cassette tape. Many computer magazines featured ZX81 program listings\u00a0\u2013 some, such as \"Sinclair Programs\", were dedicated entirely to listings \u2013 while many individuals became the archetypal \"bedroom programmers\", producing games and applications which they produced, marketed, recorded, and sold from their own homes. Some went on to found their own software houses, employing teams of programmers\u00a0\u2013 some still at school\u00a0\u2013 to produce programs for the ZX81 and other computers. Existing companies also sold software; Psion produced a series of ZX81 programs in close association with Sinclair, including a flight simulator, while ICL's range of ZX81 programs sold over 100,000 cassettes in less than three months. Psion's success with the ZX81 had a profound effect on the future of the company. Its work on the ZX81 database program \"Vu-File\" led to Psion switching its focus to the development of personal digital assistants, which resulted in the launch in 1984 of the Psion Organiser, the world's first handheld personal computer. Some of the most popular ZX81 games (Psion's \"Flight Simulation\" being an example) were rewritten for the Spectrum to take advantage of the newer machine's colour and sound capabilities.\nOne of the more bizarre software products for the ZX81 came about as a result of music companies attempting to capitalise on the popularity of Sinclair's computers. In 1983, EMI released a single by Chris Sievey that had a ZX81 program recorded on the B-side. Island Records responded with \"XL1\" by Buzzcocks frontman Pete Shelley, packaged with a program for the ZX Spectrum.\nGames.\nEnterprising programmers were able to produce games for the ZX81 using nothing more than text characters and the machine's limited text semigraphics. Some ZX81 games achieved lasting fame, such as \"3D Monster Maze\", a tense first-person perspective game that involved the player escaping a labyrinth with a \"Tyrannosaurus rex\" in pursuit. Written in a combination of BASIC and machine code, its innovative design led it to be hailed as the first home computer 3D game and a landmark in the history of computer and video games.\nClones and variants.\nSinclair's licensing agreement with Timex enabled the American company to produce three clones or offshoots of Sinclair machines for the US market. These were the Timex Sinclair 1000, Timex Sinclair 1500 (both variants of the ZX81) and the Timex Sinclair 2068 (a variant of the ZX Spectrum). The TS1000 was launched in July 1982 and sparked a massive surge of interest; at one point, the Timex phoneline was receiving over 5,000 calls an hour, 50,000 a week, inquiring about the machine or about microcomputers in general. It was virtually identical to the ZX81 save for re-branding and the addition of an extra 1\u00a0KB of memory, totalling 2\u00a0KB. In the five months following the TS1000's launch, the company sold 550,000 machines, earning Sinclair over $1.2\u00a0million in royalties.\nTimex produced a second version of the ZX81 in the form of the TS1500, essentially an Americanised ZX81 launched in August 1983. It dispensed with the membrane keyboard and used a case similar to that of the ZX Spectrum, incorporating 16\u00a0KB of on-board memory. It was effectively a stopgap between the ZX81 and Spectrum. However, it was unsuccessful due to increased competition from rival US machines and the after-effects of Timex's botched marketing of the TS1000. Although the TS1000 had initially been a great success, Timex failed to provide the essential RAM pack upgrades to the market for two or three months after it launched the TS1000. Consumers would take the machine home, plug it in and find that it would not do anything useful due to the lack of memory.\nIn addition, consumers' attitude in the US was quite different from that in the UK. Clive Sinclair told \"Informatics\" magazine in June 1981 that \"our competitors thought that consumers didn't want to learn programming. We [Sinclair Research] think they failed because of this and because of price.\" Timex evidently shared this belief but events proved it to be a false assumption. The TS1000/ZX81's price advantage was erased when its main rivals \u2013 the TI-99/4A and the VIC-20 \u2013 had their prices cut to below the all-important $100 mark. Competitors such as Apple, Atari, Commodore and Texas Instruments promoted their machines as being for business or entertainment rather than education, highlighting the value of computers with ready-made applications and more advanced features such as graphics, colour and sound.\nBy late 1983 Wayne Green reported a \"rising chorus of frustrated Timex users who are telling friends not to waste their money\". \"Hard core\" early adopters, he wrote, \"became discouraged with the quality of the product, with the poverty of software available and with the almost total lack of information on how to cope with it.\" Consumers deserted the TS1000 once its novelty value had worn off and, as publishers of programming guides found to their cost, the American public showed little interest in using the machine to learn about computer programming. American retailers were left with large stocks of unsold machines. Burned by this experience, many were unwilling to stock the later Timex Sinclair machines in large numbers and the big chain stores dropped the Timex Sinclair line altogether.\nSome companies outside the US and UK produced their own \"pirate\" versions of the ZX81 and Timex Sinclair computers, aided by weak intellectual property laws in their countries of origin. Several Brazilian companies produced ZX81 clones, notably the TK series (such as the TK85) from Microdigital Eletronica of Brazil) and Prol\u00f3gica's CP-200. Czerweny Electr\u00f3nica of Argentina produced the CZ1000 and CZ1500, clones of the ZX81 and TS1500 respectively. Lambda Electronics of Hong Kong produced the Lambda 8300, based on the ZX81, which was itself widely copied by other Chinese manufacturers.\nThe machines were not all straight copies of the ZX81; some, such as the CP-200, came with extra memory and a larger case (often with a chiclet keyboard in place of the original membrane keyboard). One clone, the TL801 from TELLAB of Italy, could emulate either the ZX80 or ZX81 and switch between the two machines via a jumper.\nImpact and legacy.\nThe ZX81 had an immediate impact on the fortunes of Sinclair Research and Clive Sinclair himself. The company's profitability rose enormously, from a pretax profit of \u00a3818,000 on a turnover of \u00a34.6\u00a0million in 1980\u201381 to \u00a38.55\u00a0million on a turnover of \u00a327.17\u00a0million in 1981\u201382. Clive Sinclair became one of the UK's highest-profile businessmen and a millionaire, receiving a \u00a31\u00a0million bonus on top of a salary of \u00a313,000. He received a knighthood in the Queen's Birthday Honours and the Young Businessman of the Year award in 1983.\nThe machine also had a widespread and lasting social impact in the United Kingdom, according to Clive Sinclair, purchasers of the ZX81 came from \"a reasonably broad spectrum\" that ranged from readers of the upmarket \"Observer\" and \"Sunday Times\" newspapers to the more downmarket but numerous \"Sun\" readers. The largest age group was around 30 years old. The \"Financial Times\" reported in March 1982 that most Sinclair computers were being bought for educational purposes, both for adults and children, though the children were usually able to learn much more quickly. Ian Adamson and Richard Kennedy note that the popularity of the ZX81 was \"subtly different from the run-of-the-mill social fad\"; although most enthusiasts were in their teens or early twenties, many were older users \u2013 often parents who had become fascinated by the ZX81s that they had bought for their children. However, the ZX81 boom was overwhelmingly male-dominated.\nOne of the ZX81's key legacies was that it spurred large numbers of people to try programming for the first time. The ZX81 plays a significant part in the plot of William Gibson's 2003 novel \"Pattern Recognition\". One character, an artist using old ZX81s as a sculptural medium, explains the cultural and intellectual impact that the machine had on British society:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Walking on, he explains to her that Sinclair, the British inventor, had a way of getting things right, but also exactly wrong. Foreseeing the market for affordable personal computers, Sinclair decided that what people would want to do with them was to learn programming. The ZX81, marketed in the United States as the Timex 1000, cost less than the equivalent of a hundred dollars, but required the user to key in programs, tapping away on that little model keyboard-sticker. This had resulted both in the short market-life of the product and, in Voytek's opinion, twenty years on, in the relative preponderance of skilled programmers in the United Kingdom. They had their heads turned by these little boxes, he believes, and by the need to program them...\n...\"But if Timex sold it in the United States,\" she asks him, \"why didn't we get the programmers?\"\n\"You have programmers, but America is different. America wanted Nintendo. Nintendo gives you no programmers. Also, on launch of product in America, RAM-expansion unit did not ship for three months. People buy computer, take it home, discover it does almost nothing. A disaster.\"\nAmong those whose first experience of home computing was provided by the ZX81 are Terry Pratchett (who used it for \"very primitive word processing\"), Edward de Bono and \u2013 perhaps proving William Gibson's point \u2013 many video game developers including Charles Cecil, Raffaele Cecco, Pete Cooke, David Perry (whose first published game, a driving game, involved \"a black blob avoiding other black blobs\"), Rhianna Pratchett, and Jon Ritman.\nEven 30 years after launch, the ZX81 has a German user forum, and one in English.\nNew hardware and software continue to be developed for the ZX81, including a ZX81-based webserver; the \"ZXpand\", a combined SD card interface, 32K configurable memory expansion, and optional joystick port and AY sound interface; and new games on cassette tape by Cronosoft, such as \"Tut-Tut\", \"Virus\", \"One Little Ghost\", and many more, as well as releases by Revival Studios, such as \"Avalanche\", \"Mayhem\", \"Down\", \"Stairrunner\" and more.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\nBooks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNews reports.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOther sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Two broad classes of Ziegler\u2013Natta catalysts are employed, distinguished by their solubility:\nZiegler\u2013Natta catalysts are used to polymerize terminal alkenes (ethylene and alkenes with the vinyl double bond):\n\"n\"\u00a0CH2=CHR \u2192 \u2212[CH2\u2212CHR]\"n\"\u2212;\nHistory.\nThe 1963 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to German Karl Ziegler, for his discovery of first titanium-based catalysts, and Italian Giulio Natta, for using them to prepare stereoregular polymers from propylene. Ziegler\u2013Natta catalysts have been used in the commercial manufacture of various polyolefins since 1956. As of 2010, the total volume of plastics, elastomers, and rubbers produced from alkenes with these and related (especially Phillips) catalysts worldwide exceeds 100 million tonnes. Together, these polymers represent the largest-volume commodity plastics as well as the largest-volume commodity chemicals in the world.\nIn the early 1950s workers at Phillips Petroleum discovered that chromium catalysts are highly effective for the low-temperature polymerization of ethylene, which launched major industrial technologies culminating in the Phillips catalyst. A few years later, Ziegler discovered that a combination of titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) and diethylaluminium chloride (Al(C2H5)2Cl) gave comparable activities for the production of polyethylene. Natta used crystalline \u03b1-TiCl3 in combination with Al(C2H5)3 to produce first isotactic polypropylene. Usually Ziegler catalysts refer to titanium-based systems for conversions of ethylene and Ziegler\u2013Natta catalysts refer to systems for conversions of propylene. \nAlso, in the 1960s, BASF developed a gas-phase, mechanically-stirred polymerization process for making polypropylene. In that process, the particle bed in the reactor was either not fluidized or not fully fluidized. In 1968, the first gas-phase fluidized-bed polymerization process, the Unipol process, was commercialized by Union Carbide to produce polyethylene. In the mid-1980s, the Unipol process was further extended to produce polypropylene.\nIn the 1970s, magnesium chloride (MgCl2) was discovered to greatly enhance the activity of the titanium-based catalysts. These catalysts were so active that the removal of unwanted amorphous polymer and residual titanium from the product (so-called deashing) was no longer necessary, enabling the commercialization of linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) resins and allowed the development of fully amorphous copolymers.\nThe fluidized-bed process remains one of the two most widely used processes for producing polypropylene.\nStereochemistry of poly-1-alkenes.\nNatta first used polymerization catalysts based on titanium chlorides to polymerize propylene and other 1-alkenes. He discovered that these polymers are crystalline materials and ascribed their crystallinity to a special feature of the polymer structure called stereoregularity. \nThe concept of stereoregularity in polymer chains is illustrated in the picture on the left with polypropylene. Stereoregular poly(1-alkene) can be isotactic or syndiotactic depending on the relative orientation of the alkyl groups in polymer chains consisting of units \u2212[CH2\u2212CHR]\u2212, like the CH3 groups in the figure. In the isotactic polymers, all stereogenic centers CHR share the same configuration. The stereogenic centers in syndiotactic polymers alternate their relative configuration. A polymer that lacks any regular arrangement in the position of its alkyl substituents (R) is called atactic. Both isotactic and syndiotactic polypropylene are crystalline, whereas atactic polypropylene, which can also be prepared with special Ziegler\u2013Natta catalysts, is amorphous. The stereoregularity of the polymer is determined by the catalyst used to prepare it.\nClasses.\nHeterogeneous catalysts.\nThe first and dominant class of titanium-based catalysts (and some vanadium-based catalysts) for alkene polymerization can be roughly subdivided into two subclasses, both heterogeneous catalysts:\nThe overlap between these two subclasses is relatively small because the requirements to the respective catalysts differ widely.\nCommercial catalysts are supported by being bound to a solid with a high surface area. Both TiCl4 and TiCl3 give active catalysts. The support in the majority of the catalysts is MgCl2. A third component of most catalysts is a carrier, a material that determines the size and the shape of catalyst particles. The preferred carrier is microporous spheres of amorphous silica with a diameter of 30\u201340\u00a0mm. During the catalyst synthesis, both the titanium compounds and MgCl2 are packed into the silica pores. All these catalysts are activated with organoaluminum compounds such as Al(C2H5)3.\nAll modern supported Ziegler\u2013Natta catalysts designed for polymerization of propylene and higher 1-alkenes are prepared with TiCl4 as the active ingredient and MgCl2 as a support. Another component of all such catalysts is an organic modifier, usually an ester of an aromatic diacid or a diether. The modifiers react both with inorganic ingredients of the solid catalysts as well as with organoaluminum cocatalysts. These catalysts polymerize propylene and other 1-alkenes to highly crystalline isotactic polymers.\nHomogeneous catalysts.\nA second class of Ziegler\u2013Natta catalysts are soluble in the reaction medium. Traditionally such homogeneous catalysts were derived from metallocenes, but the structures of active catalysts have been significantly broadened to include nitrogen-based ligands.\nMetallocene catalysts.\nThese catalysts are metallocenes together with a cocatalyst, typically MAO, \u2212[O\u2212Al(CH3)]\"n\"\u2212. The idealized metallocene catalysts have the composition Cp2MCl2 (M = Ti, Zr, Hf) such as titanocene dichloride. Typically, the organic ligands are derivatives of cyclopentadienyl. In some complexes, the two cyclopentadiene (Cp) rings are linked with bridges, like \u2212CH2\u2212CH2\u2212 or &gt;SiPh2. Depending on the type of their cyclopentadienyl ligands, for example by using an \"ansa\"-bridge, metallocene catalysts can produce either isotactic or syndiotactic polymers of propylene and other 1-alkenes.\nNon-metallocene catalysts.\nZiegler\u2013Natta catalysts of the third class, non-metallocene catalysts, use a variety of complexes of various metals, ranging from scandium to lanthanoid and actinoid metals, and a large variety of ligands containing oxygen (O2), nitrogen (N2), phosphorus (P), and sulfur (S). The complexes are activated using MAO, as is done for metallocene catalysts.\nMost Ziegler\u2013Natta catalysts and all the alkylaluminium cocatalysts are unstable in air, and the alkylaluminium compounds are pyrophoric. The catalysts, therefore, are always prepared and handled under an inert atmosphere.\nMechanism of Ziegler\u2013Natta polymerization.\nThe structure of active centers in Ziegler\u2013Natta catalysts is well established only for metallocene catalysts. An idealized and simplified metallocene complex Cp2ZrCl2 represents a typical precatalyst. It is unreactive toward alkenes. The dihalide reacts with MAO and is transformed into a metallocenium ion Cp2+ZrCH3, which is ion-paired to some derivative(s) of MAO. A polymer molecule grows by numerous insertion reactions of C=C bonds of 1-alkene molecules into the Zr\u2013C bond in the ion:\nMany thousands of alkene insertion reactions occur at each active center resulting in the formation of long polymer chains attached to the center. The Cossee\u2013Arlman mechanism describes the growth of stereospecific polymers. This mechanism states that the polymer grows through alkene coordination at a vacant site at the titanium atom, which is followed by insertion of the C=C bond into the Ti\u2212C bond at the active center.\nTermination processes.\nOn occasion, the polymer chain is disengaged from the active centers in the chain termination reaction. Several pathways exist for termination:\nCp2+Zr\u2212(CH2\u2212CHR)\"n\"\u2212CH3 + CH2=CHR \u2192 Cp2+Zr\u2212CH2\u2212CH2R + CH2=CR\u2013polymer\nAnother type of chain termination reaction called a \u03b2-hydride elimination reaction also occurs periodically: \nCp2+Zr\u2212(CH2\u2212CHR)n\u2212CH3 \u2192 Cp2+Zr\u2212H + CH2=CR\u2013polymer\nPolymerization reactions of alkenes with solid titanium-based catalysts occur at special titanium centers located on the exterior of the catalyst crystallites. Some titanium atoms in these crystallites react with organoaluminum cocatalysts with the formation of Ti\u2013C bonds. The polymerization reaction of alkenes occurs similarly to the reactions in metallocene catalysts:\nL\"n\"Ti\u2013CH2\u2212CHR\u2013polymer + CH2=CHR \u2192 L\"n\"Ti\u2013CH2-CHR\u2013CH2\u2212CHR\u2013polymer\nThe two chain termination reactions occur quite rarely in Ziegler\u2013Natta catalysis and the formed polymers have a too high molecular weight to be of commercial use. To reduce the molecular weight, hydrogen is added to the polymerization reaction:\nL\"n\"Ti\u2013CH2\u2212CHR\u2013polymer + H2 \u2192 L\"n\"Ti\u2212H + CH3\u2212CHR\u2013polymer\nAnother termination process involves the action of protic (acidic) reagents, which can be intentionally added or adventitious.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the hijacker-pilot of United Airlines Flight 93, which crashed into a rural area near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, as part of the September 11 attacks.\nHe was born in Beirut to a secular, wealthy and respected Arab family. He completed his early education at Lebanon's prestigious French-speaking Christian schools. In 1996, at the age of 21, he moved to Germany to pursue his university education. He continued his secular life, far removed from religious devotion, even in his early university years. While studying aerospace engineering at Hamburg University of Applied Sciences, he met Mohamed Atta and Marwan al-Shehhi. Between 1997 and 1998, he began to grow closer to religion. He quit drinking alcohol and smoking, and began salah and reading the Quran. He was influenced by the verses on jihad in the Quran and believed that only martyrdom could erase the sins he had committed in the past.\nLater, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, an al-Qaeda communications officer, met these three university students and founded the group known as the Hamburg cell with them. In 1999, bin al-Shibh took him and his two other school friends, Atta and al-Shehhi, to Afghanistan to meet Osama bin Laden. In June 2000, he flew to New Jersey, United States. Shortly thereafter, he moved from New Jersey to Venice, Florida and trained with flight instructors Rudi Dekkers at Huffman Aviation alongside Atta and al-Shehhi until January 2001. On 7 September 2001, he arrived in Newark, New Jersey from Fort Lauderdale, Florida. \nFour days later, he boarded United Airlines Flight 93 and hijacked the plane along with Saeed al-Ghamdi, Ahmed al-Haznawi, and Ahmed al-Nami. They attempted to crash the plane into the United States Capitol Building or the White House. However, the mission failed when a passenger uprising took place forcing Jarrah to crash the plane into a field in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, twenty minutes away from D.C.\nAccording to the \"9/11 Commission Report\" and Aysel \u015eeng\u00fcn's (his girlfriend) statements to German police, Jarrah spoke at least four languages at a high level: Arabic, French, German, and English.\nEarly life and education.\nZiad Samir Jarrah was born on 11 May 1975, in Beirut, Lebanon, into a wealthy and respected Arab family. His father, Samir Jarrah, was a social service inspector employed by the Lebanese government, while his mother worked as an elementary school teacher. Although nominally Sunni Muslim, his parents maintained a secular lifestyle. In Lebanon, he received primary and secondary education at prestigious French-speaking Christian institutions favored by the country's elite.\nFrom an early age, Jarrah expressed a strong interest in aviation, but his family opposed this ambition. As his father later recounted to \"The Wall Street Journal\" one week after the attacks: \"I stopped him from being a pilot. I only have one son and I was afraid that he would crash.\" According to Mahmood Ali, a sports club operator in D\u00fcsseldorf who last spoke with Jarrah by phone in July 2001, Jarrah's family was the most influential family in Marj, Lebanon. His uncle Jamal Jarrah (b.\u20091956) was a wealthy banker at the time; he was a member of the Lebanese parliament from 2005\u20132018, and is currently a member of the political party Future Movement. In addition, the father of his cousin Salim Ghazi Jarrah was a high-ranking official in the Lebanese government.\nBetween 1995 and 1996, while Jarrah resided in Lebanon, an individual bearing the same name reportedly rented an apartment in Brooklyn, New York. The landlords identified the tenant as matching the photographs later released by the FBI. In spring 1996, Jarrah relocated to Germany with his cousin Salim Ghazi Jarrah to enroll in a German-language certificate program at the University of Greifswald\u2014a prerequisite for non-native speakers pursuing higher education in the country. During this period, while sharing an apartment with his cousin, Jarrah frequently attended discos and beach parties, and his mosque attendance diminished. Alcohol and cigarettes were part of his life. He formed a close friendship with Aysel \u015eeng\u00fcn, a German citizen of Turkish descent studying dentistry. The two maintained an intermittent romantic relationship for the rest of his life and briefly cohabited, a circumstance that displeased his more religiously observant acquaintances.\nIn September 1997, Jarrah departed Greifswald to pursue a degree in aerospace engineering at the Fachhochschule (University of Applied Sciences) in Hamburg. Concurrently, he was employed at a Volkswagen paint shop in nearby Wolfsburg. While in Hamburg, he rented an apartment from Rosemarie Canel, who later painted his portrait; Jarrah presented the artwork to his mother as a gift during a visit home that December.\nThe \"9/11 Commission Report\" states that Jarrah was a member of the Hamburg cell, along with Mohamed Atta and the others. He did not live with any of the others, however, and can be confirmed to have met with any of them in Hamburg only on a single occasion: that of Said Bahaji's wedding at the al-Quds Mosque in October 1999.\nTraining in Afghanistan.\nIn late 1999, Jarrah, together with Mohamed Atta, Marwan al-Shehhi, Said Bahaji, and Ramzi bin al-Shibh, decided to travel to the Muslim Chechen Republic of Ichkeria to participate in \"jihad\" against Russian forces in the Second Chechen War. At the eleventh hour, however, Khalid al-Masri and Mohamedou Ould Slahi persuaded the group to redirect their journey to Afghanistan, where they were to meet Osama bin Laden and undergo training for terrorist activities. Upon arrival, Jarrah was assigned the \"kunya\" (lit.\u2009'the Visitors' Father').\nThey were told they were on a highly secret mission and were instructed to return to Germany after the operation and enroll in flight school. In October 1999, Jarrah was filmed at Said Bahaji's wedding with other 9/11 hijackers, including al-Shehhi. \nIn 2006, a video surfaced showing Jarrah, still bearded, reading his will in January 2000 along with Mohamed Atta. Not long after this, Jarrah shaved his beard and began to act in a more secular way, according to \u015eeng\u00fcn. Many of the future hijackers attempted to hide their radicalism and blend in with the population. To hide his travels to Afghanistan (which may have concerned security officials at international airports) Jarrah reported his passport stolen in February 2000 and received a blank duplicate, just as hijackers Atta and Shehhi had done the previous month.\nJarrah dropped out of the \"Fachhochschule\" and began looking at flight schools. He claimed that this was to fulfill his childhood dream of being a pilot. After looking in several countries, he decided that none of the flight schools in Europe were adequate. On the advice of a childhood friend, he prepared to move to the United States.\nIn the United States.\nJarrah apparently entered the United States on seven occasions, more than any other hijacker. On 25 May 2000, he applied for and received a five-year US B-1/B-2\n(tourist/business) visa in Berlin. On 27 June 2000, he went to the US for the first time, arriving at Newark International Airport. He then traveled to Florida together with al-Shehhi and Atta, where the three men enrolled full-time at Huffman Aviation, in Venice. Jarrah did not apply for a change in his status, from a tourist visa to a student visa, thus violating his immigration status.\nJarrah was enrolled in flight school for six months, from June 2000 to 15 January 2001. At the flight school, many of his classmates remember him fondly, describing him as kind and trustworthy, and remember him drinking beer occasionally. Jarrah was unique among the hijackers in that he did not live with any other hijackers, but rather with a German student named Thorsten Biermann. Biermann did not observe Jarrah acting particularly religiously or overtly politically. Jarrah occasionally flew back to Germany to visit \u015eeng\u00fcn, and called or e-mailed her nearly every day.\nRudi Dekkers, a Dutchman and the flight instructor of Huffman Aviation, was interviewed after the attacks in 2001 by authorities. According to Dekkers, both Jarrah and al-Shehhi were good students, unlike Atta, who misbehaved and refused to follow instructions. Dekkers told Atta that he was going to kick him out of the school if his behavior did not change, and as a response, Atta's behavior began to improve. Dekkers also said that he went with al-Shehhi and Jarrah to a bar in Sarasota, Florida named Shamrock Pub after one of their flight lessons. At the bar, they talked to Dekkers about their plans after getting their pilot licenses, and Jarrah said to Dekkers \"I got a job lined up and we are planning to become pilots.\"\nJarrah had obtained his license to fly small aircraft in August 2000, and began training to fly large jets later that year. He flew to Beirut to visit his family, and then to Germany to visit his girlfriend, \u015eeng\u00fcn. He brought her back to the United States for a ten-day visit, and she even attended a flight school session with him. In late January 2001, he again flew to Beirut to visit his father, who was ill, and then to Germany to visit his girlfriend. He returned to the United States once again in late February. His behavior was markedly different from the other hijackers, who broke off all familial and romantic relations.\nOn his way back to the US, he passed through the United Arab Emirates, according to that country's officials, where he was initially reported as having been interviewed by authorities on 30 January 2001, at the request of the CIA. He allegedly admitted to having been to Afghanistan and Pakistan, although the CIA has since denied the claim and the \"9/11 Commission Report\" does not mention it. The Florida flight school where Jarrah had been studying also said he was in school there until 15 January 2001.\nOn May 2, Jarrah and Atta were in Lauderdale Lakes, Florida to get Florida driver\u2019s licenses, the same day that al-Shehhi returned to Miami after visiting Atta\u2019s father in Cairo to pick up Atta\u2019s international driver\u2019s license and some money. \nOn 6 May, Jarrah, Atta, and al-Shehhi registered for a two-month membership at the US1 Fitness Center, a gym in Dania Beach, Florida\u2014they would later renew their membership for two more months, and eventually had lessons in close-quarters combat. It is believed that sometime in that month, Ahmed al-Haznawi, who arrived on June 8, moved in with Jarrah. Jarrah rented a new apartment in Lauderdale-by-the-Sea after both men gave the landlord photocopies of their German passports, which he later turned over to the FBI.\nAccording to the \"9/11 Commission Report\", Jarrah took surveillance flights in the summer of 2001 from Baltimore to Las Vegas watching the operations of the flight crew. The other two pilots Atta and Al-Shehhi went on surveillance flights in May and June 2001, Atta flew from Boston via Las Vegas while Al-Shehhi flew from New York City via Las Vegas and the 3 Hamburg Pilots went on surveillance flights from the United States to Europe in the summer of 2001. \nOn 25 June, Jarrah took al-Haznawi to Holy Cross Hospital in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on the advice of his landlord. Al-Haznawi was treated by Dr. Christos Tsonas, who gave him antibiotics for a cut on his left calf. While he told staff that he had bumped into a suitcase, the media briefly reported it as a sign of cutaneous anthrax, hoping to show a link to the 2001 anthrax attacks, although the FBI later addressed the rumors, stating that \"exhaustive testing did not support that anthrax was present anywhere the hijackers had been.\"\nIn mid-July 2001, some of the hijackers and members of the Hamburg cell gathered near Salou, Spain, for a period of a few days up to a couple of weeks. There seemed to be tension between Jarrah and Atta about the plot in its late stages. Atta had complained to Ramzi bin al-Shibh about his difficulty in getting through to Jarrah and his fear that Jarrah might withdraw from the plot completely. On 25 July, Jarrah flew to Germany on a one-way ticket and again met with his girlfriend, the last time she saw him (though they would talk by telephone at least once more). Later, he met with bin al-Shibh who convinced Jarrah to go through with the operation. Jarrah arrived back in the United States on 5 August, though other sources indicate that he took his pilot's test on 2 August, having missed his sister's wedding to do so. On 27 August, he checked into the Pin-Del Motel in Laurel, Maryland, only a mile away from the Valencia Motel, where four other hijackers were staying. On 7 September 2001, all four of the Flight 93 hijackers flew from Fort Lauderdale to Newark International Airport aboard Spirit Airlines.\nIn the early morning hours of 9 September 2001, Jarrah was pulled over for speeding in Maryland and received a ticket. Jarrah phoned his parents later that day, mentioning that he had received the money order they had sent five days earlier. He told them he intended to see them on 22 September for his cousin's wedding.\nOn 10 September, Jarrah spent his final evening writing a letter to \u015eeng\u00fcn, with whom he had made marriage plans. This letter is widely interpreted as a suicide note. The letter did not reach \u015eeng\u00fcn; she had entered witness protection shortly after the attacks and her apartment was unattended. The letter was returned to the United States by the German postal service, where it was discovered and delivered to the FBI. The note contained the phrases \"I did what I had to\" and \"It is a great honour and you will see the result, and everyone will be celebrating.\"\nAccording to one source, Jarrah had set up a large mock cockpit made of cardboard boxes in his apartment just before the attacks.\n9/11 attacks and death.\nOn 11 September 2001, Jarrah called his girlfriend Aysel \u015eeng\u00fcn from his hotel room, repeating the words \"I love you\" over and over. At 5:01 AM in Newark, Jarrah placed a phone call to United Airlines Flight 175 hijacker pilot Marwan al-Shehhi in Boston; the pair spoke for less than a minute, likely to confirm that the plan for the attacks was ready to proceed. While Jarrah made a similar call to American Airlines Flight 11 hijacker pilot Mohamed Atta, this did not occur between Jarrah and American Airlines Flight 77 hijacker pilot Hani Hanjour. Jarrah, Saeed al-Ghamdi, Ahmed al-Haznawi, and Ahmed al-Nami boarded United Airlines Flight 93 from Newark International Airport at gate A17 without incident, and sat in first-class seats near the cockpit. Due to a delay, the plane took off at 8:42, four minutes before American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into the World Trade Center. The pilot and crew were notified of the first two hijackings that day, and were told to be on alert. Within minutes, around 9:28a.m., Flight 93 was hijacked as well. The 9/11 Commission stated that Jarrah was the pilot.\nJarrah's voice was heard by air traffic control \"Ladies and gentlemen: here the captain. Please sit down, keep remaining seating. We have a bomb on board. So sit.\" At 09:32:08, the sound of breaking glass was heard as Jarrah, shouted in English, \"Don't move! Shut up. Come on, come. Shut up! Don't move! Stop! Sit, sit, sit down! Stop!\", while a wounded man, believed to be a pilot, was heard moaning, along with the sounds of a seat being adjusted. Jarrah continued shouting, \"Sit, sit, sit down! Sit down!\" Another hijacker chimed in at 9:32:54 in English: \"Stop!\" At 9:33:09, the wounded man pleaded, \"No more,\" as a hijacker simultaneously ordered, \"Sit down!\" In Arabic, a hijacker said, \"That's it, that's it, that's it\", then switched to English: \"Down, down!\" Jarrah shouted, \"Shut up!\" At 9:33:34 a.m., after several clicking noises, a hijacker recited the Basmala. Then someone said, \"Finish, no more. No more!\" A hijacker shouted, \"Stop, stop, stop, stop!\" The man pleaded, \"No! No, no, no, no!\" He repeated this four more times. A hijacker ordered, \"Down! Go ahead, lie down. Lie down! Down. Down. Down!\" The hijackers' orders of \"Down, down, down!\" and the desperate pleas of \"No more...no more\", continued, until at 09:34:27, a woman, thought to be first-class flight attendant Debbie Welsh, is heard in the background and is heard pleading, \"Please, please, please...\" A hijacker shouted, \"Down!\" The woman pleaded, \"Please, please, don't hurt me.\" The hijacker said, \"Down!\" and again the man said \"No more.\" The woman cried out, \"Oh, God!\" A hijacker again repeated, \"Down, down, down!\" and Jarrah said, \"Sit down!\" Another hijacker (or possibly the same) said \"Shut up!\" At 09:34:38, the sounds of a warning bell indicated Jarrah was trying to disconnect the autopilot to change the plane's destination. A knock on the cockpit door by another hijacker was answered by Jarrah saying in Arabic, \"One moment, one moment.\" At 09:35:03, the shouting continued: the man said, \"No more.\" Then, Jarrah shouted, \"Down, down, down!\" As Jarrah instructed the autopilot to turn the plane and head east at 09:35:09, the man begged, \"No, no, no, no, no, no...\" Jarrah said, \"Sit down, sit down, sit down! Down!\" The other hijacker said, \"What's this?\" in Arabic. Jarrah, still talking in English said, \"Sit down! Sit down! You know, sit down!\" The woman spoke again at 9:35:24 apparently asking the wounded man, \"Are you talking to me?\" A hijacker shouted, \"Down, down, down, down!\" and ten seconds later, the woman pleaded for her life, \"I don't want to die!\" A hijacker again said, \"No, no. Down, Down!\" The woman repeated, \"I don't want to die. I don't want to die.\" The man said \"No\" twice more while the hijacker again said \"Down\" six more times. The woman begged again, \"No, no please.\" The \"sound of a snap\" reverberated in the cockpit as the woman sobbed \"No!\", and her crying continued as she was heard to struggle with the hijackers for less than a minute before being killed or otherwise silenced. At 09:37:06, Jarrah said in Arabic, \"That's it. Go back,\" then in English, \"Back.\" He said \"That's it!\" in Arabic again, then in English again to the man, \"Sit down!\" At 09:37:36, the other hijacker said in Arabic, \"Everything is fine. I finished.\" At 9:39\u00a0a.m., Jarrah in a much calmer voice, announced over the radio, \"This is the captain. Would like you all to remain seated. There is a bomb on board and we are going back to the airport, and to have our demands, so please remain quiet.\" Flight 93 continued to descend more than 20,000 feet from a peak of 40,700 feet between 9:39 and 9:45 a.m. The plane finally stabilized by 9:46 a.m. before Jarrah, apparently worried that they were losing altitude too quickly, jerked the plane's nose upward, than began another more gradual descent. At 9:45 a.m., with the plane's descent to eastward continuing, a hijacker discussed with Jarrah on whether to open the cockpit door to the other two hijackers. The hijacker said, \"How about we let them in? We let the guys in now.\" Jarrah responded, \"Okay.\" The hijacker asked again, \"Should we let the guys in?\" Jarrah answered, \"Inform them, and tell him to talk to the pilot; bring the pilot back\", suggesting one of the United pilots were possibly still alive. At 09:45;57, Jarrah whispered the Shahada.\nAt least two of the cellphone calls made by passengers indicate that all the hijackers they saw were wearing red bandanas, and indicated that one of the men, believed to be either al-Haznawi or al-Nami, had a box tied around his torso, and claimed there was a bomb inside. Passengers on the plane had learned the fates of the other hijacked planes through telephone calls; a group decided to act, to retake the plane. At 9:53 a.m., the hijackers in the cockpit, having either overheard or sensed that the passengers were preparing a revolt, suggested using the plane's fire axe, to intimidate the passengers and blunt a counterattack. \"The best thing: The guys will go in, [you] lift up the [unintelligible word], and they put the ax into it. So, everyone will be scared.\" After some confusion among his collaborators, a hijacker explained that should hold up the axe to the peephole of the cockpit door, \"Let him look through the window. Let him look through the window.\" A passenger uprising began at 9:57. Analysis of the plane's cockpit recording by the United States investigators showed a group of passengers tried to break into the cockpit. The hijackers in the cockpit became aware of the revolt at 09:57:55, when they heard sounds of fighting and yells from the cabin, Jarrah exclaiming, \"Is there something? A fight?\" Another hijacker shouted \"Yeah!\" in response. Apparently, a third hijacker fled from the first-class section and shut himself in the cockpit. Sounds of a fight and a man's screams reverberated off the plane's cabin walls. Jarrah yelled in Arabic, \"Let's go guys!\" and recited the \"takbir\" twice, pausing to say, \"Oh, guys!\" and recited the takbir again. Jarrah began to roll the airplane left and right to knock the passengers off balance, causing the plane to rock it wings. As a result, the plane left its Washington, D.C. course. The struggle outside the cockpit continued with grunts and yells. At 09:58:44, Jarrah yelled, \"Oh Allah! Oh Allah! Oh, the most gracious!\" Eight seconds later, a hijacker outside the cockpit, shouted \"Stay back!\" in English, but the passengers continued their assault and at 09:58:55, a passenger, most likely Burnett, shouted \"In the cockpit! In the cockpit!\" A flustered Jarrah yelled at another hijacker in the cockpit to hold against the door at 09:58:57, \"They want to get in here! Hold [the door], hold from the inside! Hold from the inside! Hold!\" Jarrah wagged the plane's wings more sharply, but to no avail. A hijacker outside the cockpit shouted, \"Sit down!\" and repeated this two times. At 09:59:18, Jarrah, realizing how many passengers were taking part, exclaimed \"What? There are some guys. All those guys.\" A passenger yelled \"Let's get them!\" at 09:59:20, as again the hijacker outside the cockpit said, \"Sit down!\" A passenger shouted, \"Get \u2019em! Get \u2019em! C\u2019mon! C\u2019mon!\" The fight continued, as Jarrah and a hijacker exclaimed \"what?!\" several times over the noise. The other hijacker in the cockpit said, \"Trust in Allah, and in Him.\" The hijacker outside the cockpit insisted, \"Sit down.\", but a violent struggle ensued and the hijacker was heard screaming. Jarrah changed tactics at 09:59:52 and began pitching the nose of the airplane up and down. Jarrah stabilized the plane at 10:00:03. At 10:00:06 a.m., the hijackers in the cockpit realized they would never reach their target. Discouraged, a hijacker said in Arabic, \"There is nothing.\" Jarrah asked, \"Is that it? Shall we finish it off?\" Another hijacker (or possibly the same) responded, \"No. Not yet. When they all come, we finish it off,\" before saying, \"There is nothing!\" The voice recorder recorded the sound of the passengers using the food cart as a battering ram against the cockpit door. At 10:00:22, Jarrah exclaimed, \"Oh Allah! Oh Allah! Oh gracious!\" At 10:00:37, Jarrah repeatedly pitched the plane's nose up and down, and instructed a hijacker to help him with the controls, switching between Arabic and English, he commanded: \"Up, down. Up, down, in the cockpit.\" He then addressed al-Ghamdi by name, \"Up, down. Saeed, up, down!\" Jarrah ceased the violent maneuvers at 10:01:00 and recited the \"takbir\" twice. He then asked another hijacker, \"Is that it? I mean, shall we put it down?\" The other hijacker responded, \"Yes, put it in it, and pull it down.\" At 10:01:11, Jarrah yelled for al-Ghamdi to cut off oxygen to the cabin, \"Saeed! Cut off the oxygen! Cut off the oxygen! Cut off the oxygen! Cut off the oxygen!\". The passengers continued their assault as Jarrah called out \"Up, down. Up, down\". A hijacker called out confused, \"What?\" and Jarrah repeated, \"Up, down.\" At 10:02:17, a male passenger said, \"Turn it up!\" A hijacker, possibly al-Ghamdi, yelled, \"Down! Down! Pull it down! Pull it down!\" His cries were drowned by a passenger who said, \"Down. Push, push, push, push, push.\" At 10:02:33, Jarrah shouted \"Hey! Hey!\" and screamed in Arabic, \"Give it to me! Give it to me! Give it to me! Give it to me! Give it to me! Give it to me! Give it to me! Give it to me!\", possibly referring to the plane's yoke. At 10:03:02, amidst screams and shouts, a hijacker, possibly al-Ghamdi, began shouting the \"takbir\", his cries drowned out by a passenger shouting \"No!\" The last sound was the hijacker whispering the \"takbir\", when the plane crashed, just outside of Shanksville, Pennsylvania, at 10:03:11, 125 miles (200\u00a0km) from Washington, D.C. All aboard died instantly. The National Transportation Safety Board reported that the flight impacted at .\nAfter 11 September, Jarrah's girlfriend, \u015eeng\u00fcn, filed a missing person report in Bochum. Jarrah became a suspect as FBI agents found a \"Ziad Jarrahi\" in the flight manifest (the additional \"i\" at the end a possible misspelling). His remains were identified and turned over to the FBI as evidence after DNA samples submitted by his girlfriend were matched to remains recovered in Shanksville.\nMistaken identity claims.\nThere have been claims that Jarrah was not a hijacker but rather an innocent passenger or that he was not present on the plane and his identity was stolen. It has been pointed out that his behavior deviated from the profile presented by the other hijackers and that the passengers reported three and not four hijackers. However, the October 2006 emergence of a video shot on 18 January 2000, showing Jarrah recording his will alongside Mohamed Atta has cast heavy doubt on such claims.\nShortly after the September 11 attacks, family and friends claimed that Jarrah did not exhibit the same \"smoldering political resentments\" or \"cultural conservatism\" as Atta and the other hijackers. Although his family was Sunni Muslim, Jarrah was not raised with a background of religious conviction and did not hold to an obviously conservative lifestyle. Personnel at the flight school Jarrah attended described him as \"a normal person\". Jarrah called his family two days, and his girlfriend Aysel \u015eeng\u00fcn three hours, before boarding United Airlines Flight 93; \u015eeng\u00fcn described the conversation as \"pleasant\" and \"normal\". She also claimed that he never mentioned any names of the other hijackers. In his call two days before the attack, Jarrah told his family he would be coming home for a cousin's wedding. \"It makes no sense,\" his uncle Jamal claimed. \"He said he had even bought a new suit for the occasion.\" Jarrah's family in Lebanon claimed in September 2001 that he was an innocent passenger on the plane. His uncle, Jamal Jarrah, served as a deputy in the Lebanese parliament from 2005 to 2018 and was appointed minister on 18 December 2016, and a member of the Future Movement, a pro-Saudi Arabian political party led by Saad Hariri. On 2 January 2012, in a televised interview on Future TV, MPJarrah denied his nephew's involvement in the 9/11 attacks, alluding to a conspiracy.\nOn 23 October 2001, John Ashcroft claimed that Jarrah had shared a Hamburg apartment with Mohamed Atta and Marwan al-Shehhi, though German authorities that same day told the \"Los Angeles Times\" that they had no evidence that any of Jarrah's three apartments in Hamburg had been connected with the other hijackers. One high-ranking German police official stated, \"The only information we have connecting the three Hamburg suspects is the FBI's assertion that there is a connection.\" In October 2006, however, a video surfaced showing Atta and Jarrah together in Afghanistan, clearly connecting Jarrah to the members of the Hamburg cell.\nThe 9/11 Commission concluded without qualification that Jarrah was a hijacker on the plane when it crashed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.\nIn October 2006, an al-Qaeda video was released showing Jarrah and Mohamed Atta recording their wills in January 2000 in Osama bin Laden's Tarnak Farms base near Kandahar, Afghanistan.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Zionists wanted to create a Jewish state in Palestine with as much land, as many Jews, and as few Palestinian Arabs as possible.\nZionism initially emerged in Central and Eastern Europe as a secular nationalist movement in the late 19th century, in reaction to newer waves of antisemitism and in response to the Haskalah, or Jewish Enlightenment. The arrival of Zionist settlers to Palestine during this period is widely seen as the start of the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict. The Zionist claim to Palestine was based on the notion that the Jews' historical right to the land outweighed that of the Arabs.\nIn 1917, the Balfour Declaration established Britain's support for the movement. In 1922, the Mandate for Palestine, governed by Britain, explicitly privileged Jewish settlers over the local Palestinian population. In 1948, the State of Israel declared its independence and the first Arab\u2013Israeli war broke out. During the war, Israel expanded its territory to control over 78% of Mandatory Palestine. As a result of the 1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight, an estimated 160,000 of 870,000 Palestinians in the territory remained, forming a Palestinian minority in Israel.\nZionist views have varied over time and are not uniform, resulting in a variety of types of Zionism. The Zionist mainstream has historically included Liberal, Labor, Revisionist, and Cultural Zionism, while groups like Brit Shalom and Ihud have been dissident factions within the movement. Religious Zionism is a variant of Zionist ideology that brings together secular nationalism and religious conservatism. Advocates of Zionism have viewed it as a national liberation movement for the repatriation of an indigenous people (who were subject to persecution and share a national identity through national consciousness), to the homeland of their ancestors. Opponents of Zionism often characterize it as a supremacist, colonialist, or racist ideology, or as a settler colonialist movement.\nEtymology and terminology.\nThe word \"Zion\" itself derives from Mount Zion, which is a hill in Jerusalem and a term used in the Hebrew Bible. It has been used poetically as a synecdoche to refer to the Land of Israel since the period of the Babylonian Exile, with particular importance in Jewish messianic belief. The messianic conception of \"Zion\" was utilized by the Rabbi Zvi Hirsch Kalischer, who wrote \"Seeking Zion\" in 1862, a proto-Zionist text which was the first written work to demand that the Jews migrate en-masse to Palestine.\nThe first time the term \"Zion\" was associated with a mass movement was with the (lit. 'Lovers of Zion'), also known as the (lit.\u2009'Love of Zion'), who came together at the 1884 Katowice Conference, inspired by Leon Pinsker's pamphlet \"Auto-Emancipation\". The first use of the term as an -ism is attributed to the Austrian Nathan Birnbaum, in an 1890 article in his periodical , itself named after Pinsker's pamphlet. Birnbaum used the term \"Zionism\" in reference to the activities of the Lovers of Zion. In 1893, Birnbaum published \"The National Rebirth of The Jewish People in its Own Land\", which advocated for the Jews to migrate to Palestine. In the same year, Birnbaum founded \"Zion: Union of Austrian Societies for the Colonization of Palestine and Syria\", to carry out his proposals.\nThe paramount Zionist leader Theodor Herzl was unaware of Birnbaum's original usage of the term before popularizing the term \"Zionism\" himself. In Herzl's diary entries between 1895 and early 1896, he originally used the term \"Zionist\" to describe others, and not himself. Herzl used the term \"Zionist\" to describe those in the Lovers of Zion, who Herzl saw as fellow Jewish nationalists, but without a concrete plan. When Herzl published \"Der Judenstaat\" in 1896, he used the term \"Zionist\" in the text, often in a critical light, to describe emigration advocates like the Lovers of Zion. In \"Der Judenstaat\", Herzl called for the creation of a Jewish state, an idea which he claimed was \"an ancient one\" that he did not \"discover\". After the publication of \"Der Judenstaat\", Birnbaum wrote a review of the book, attributing its success to the author proudly embracing Zionism, but also criticized the cultural proposals of Herzl. Birnbaum quickly struck up a correspondence with Herzl, and gave him a copy of \"The National Rebirth of The Jewish People in its Own Land\", as a sort of Zionist education.\nHerzl did not begin self-identifying as a \"Zionist\" until months after the publication of . Herzl's usage of \"Zionism\" was later popularized when convening the 1897 First Zionist Congress and the Zionist Organization founded there.\nBeliefs.\nNational self-determination.\nFundamental to Zionism is the belief that Jews constitute a nation, and have a moral and historic right and need for self-determination. According to Gideon Shimoni and Yakov Rabkin, in contrast to the Zionist notion of nationhood the Judaic sense of being a nation was rooted in religious beliefs of unique chosenness and divine providence, rather than in ethnicity. Specifically, prayers emphasized distinctiveness from other nations where a connection to Eretz Israel and the anticipation of restoration were based on messianic beliefs and religious practices, not modern nationalist conceptions.\nA Jewish home and state in Palestine.\nEarly Zionism was ambiguous about the form self-determination might take. While some texts spoke of a \"Jewish state\", others spoke only of a \"Jewish homeland\" (as in the Zionist movement\u2019s Basel declaration) or \"national home for the Jewish people\" (the term used in the Balfour Declaration), usually under the sovereignty of the Ottoman and, later, the British Empire. According to Shlomo Avineri, it was only in the 1930s that a sovereign state rather than home became the fully articulated goal.\nSimilarly, some early Zionists, including Herzl, considered possibilities for a Jewish national home or state outside Palestine, for example in the Americas or Africa. In 1905 (after Herzl's death), a majority of the Zionist Congress voted against the proposal to settle in East Africa, and the supporters of this proposal, led by Israel Zangwill, split from the movement to form the Jewish Territorial Organisation.\nOver time, the belief that Jews have a moral and historic right and need for self-determination in Palestine became the dominant Zionist view. The Zionist claim to Palestine was based on the notion that Jews had a hereditary right to the land that outweighed the equivalent nationalist claims of the local Arabs. After suffering as a minority in Europe and the Middle East, establishing a Jewish state, with a Jewish majority, became a focus of the Zionist movement. Zionist organizations encouraged immigration to Palestine, and antisemitism produced a strong push factor.\nClaim to a Jewish demographic majority.\nThe establishment of a Jewish demographic majority was an essential aspect of Zionism. Israeli historian Yosef Gorny argues that this demographic change required annulling the majority status of the Arabs. Gorny argues that the Zionist movement regarded Arab motives in Palestine as lacking both moral and historical significance. According to Israeli historian Simha Flapan, the view expressed in Golda Meir\u2019s 1969 interview comment that \"there was no such thing as Palestinians\" is a cornerstone of Zionist policy. After the Holocaust, even those on the far-left of the Zionist movement, including Martin Buber and other members of Brit Shalom, did not see the Arabs as having an equally weighty claim to nationhood in Palestine, and sought demographic parity. Judah Magnes, even after the Holocaust, continued to support a binational state, even one imposed by the Great Powers, but was unable to find any Arab interlocutors. British officials supporting the Zionist effort also held similar beliefs.\nUnlike other forms of nationalism, the Zionist claim to Palestine was aspirational and required a mechanism by which the claim could be realized. The territorial concentration of Jews in Palestine and the subsequent goal of establishing a Jewish majority there was the main mechanism by which Zionist groups sought to realize this claim. By the time of the 1936 Arab Revolt, the political differences between the various Zionist groups had shrunk further, with almost all Zionist groups seeking a Jewish state in Palestine. While not every Zionist group openly called for the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine, every group in the Zionist mainstream was wedded to the idea of establishing a Jewish demographic majority there.\nIn pursuing a Jewish demographic majority, the Zionist movement encountered the demographic problem posed by the presence of the local Arab population, which was predominantly non-Jewish. The practical issue of establishing a Jewish state in a majority non-Jewish region was an issue of fundamental importance for the Zionist movement. Many Zionist activists intended to establish a Jewish majority through Jewish immigration to the region.\nZionists used the term \"transfer\" as a euphemism for the removal, or what would now be called ethnic cleansing, of the Palestinian population. According to Benny Morris, the idea of transfer played a large role in Zionist ideology from the inception of the movement and was seen as the main method of maintaining the \"Jewishness\" of the Zionist's state. He argues that \"transfer\" was \"inevitable and inbuilt into Zionism\" and that a land that was primarily Arab could not be transformed into a Jewish state without displacing the Arab population. Further, the stability of the Jewish state could not be ensured given the Arab population's fear of displacement. He argues that this would be the primary source of conflict between the Zionist movement and the Arab population.\nThe concept of \"transfer\" had a long pedigree in Zionist thought, as it was considered both moral and practical, as a way to deal with the Palestinian problem, create a Jewish homeland and avoid ethnic conflict. The concept of removing the non-Jewish population from Palestine garnered support across the entire spectrum of Zionist groups, eventually including its farthest left factions, who, after realizing the extent of the destruction of European Jewry, viewed it as a lesser evil. Transfer thought began early in the movement's development in various forms. \"Transfer\" was not only seen as desirable but also as an ideal solution by some in the Zionist leadership, but it remained controversial.\nPerceived deficiencies of assimilation, negation of diasporic life.\nFrom the perspective of some early Zionist thinkers, Jews living amongst non-Jews suffer from impediments that can be addressed only by rejecting the Jewish identity that developed while living amongst non-Jews. Accordingly, the early Zionists sought to develop a nationalist Jewish political life in a territory where Jews constitute a demographic majority. The early Zionist thinkers saw the integration of Jews into non-Jewish society as both unrealistic (or insufficient to address the deficiencies associated with demographic minority status) and undesirable, since assimilation was accompanied by the dilution of Jewish cultural distinctiveness. The Zionist solution to the perceived deficiencies of diasporic life (or the \"Jewish Question\") was dependent on the territorial concentration of Jews in Palestine, with the longer-term goal of establishing a Jewish demographic majority there.\nNegation of the Diaspora is a concept that asserts that Jews living in the Diaspora\u2014that is, outside of the Land of Israel\u2014are in an environment that is inherently harmful and so must be fixed to ensure the survival and the cohesion of the Jews as a people, often to the extent that the Jewish people have no future without amassing at their \"spiritual centre\" in the Land of Israel.\nZionism and secular Jewish identity.\nZionism sought to reconfigure Jewish identity and culture in nationalist and secular terms. According to Yaacov Yadgar, Zionism rejected traditional Judaic definitions of what it means to be Jewish, but struggled to offer a new interpretation of Jewish identity independent of rabbinical tradition. Yagdar argues that Jewish religion is viewed as an essentially negative factor in Zionism, even in religious Zionist ideology, and as responsible for the diminishing status of Jews living as a minority. Responding to the challenges of modernity, Zionism sought to replace religious and community institutions with secular-nationalistic ones. Indeed, Zionism maintained primarily the outward symbols of Jewish tradition, redefining them in a nationalistic context. Zionism saw itself as bringing Jews into the modern world by redefining what it means to be Jewish in terms of identification with a sovereign state, rather than Judaic faith and tradition.\nThis new identity would be based on a rejection of the life of exile. Zionism portrayed the Diaspora Jew as mentally unstable, physically frail, and prone to engaging in transient businesses. They were seen as detached from nature, purely materialistic, and focused solely on their personal gains. In contrast, the vision for the new Jew was radically different: an individual of strong moral and aesthetic values, not shackled by religion, driven by ideals and willing to challenge degrading circumstances; a liberated, dignified person eager to defend both personal and national pride. This was the \"New Jew\" posited by Nordau's Muscular Judaism and later the pioneering \"Sabra\" celebrated in Israeli nationalism - not the feminine, over-intellectual, degenerate \"Luftmenschen\" (people of air) of the diaspora, as Nordau characterised them.\nAccording to Yadgar, the Zionist goal of reframing of Jewish identity in secular-nationalist terms meant primarily the decline of the status of religion in the Jewish community. Prominent Zionist thinkers frame the development development of secular identity as nationalism functionally serving the same role as religion. Zionism sought to make Jewish ethnic-nationalism the distinctive trait of Jews rather than their commitment to Judaism. According to Yadgar, Zionism instead adopted a racial understanding of Jewish identity. According to Yadgar, framed this way (for instance by A. B. Yehoshua), Jewish identity is only secondarily a matter of tradition or culture. Nur Masalha says Zionist thinkers view the movement as a \"revolt against a tradition of many centuries\" of living parasitically at the margins of Western society. Indeed, he says, Zionism was uncomfortable with the term \"Jewish,\" associating it with passivity, spirituality and the stain of \"galut\". Instead, Zionist thinkers preferred the term \"Hebrew\" to describe their identity. Zionism linked the term \"Jewish\" with negative characteristics prevalent in European anti-Semitic stereotypes, which Zionists believed could be remedied only through sovereignty.\nRevival of the Hebrew language.\nThe revival of the Hebrew language in Eastern Europe as a secular literary medium marked a significant cultural shift among Jews, who per Judaic tradition used Hebrew only for religious purposes. The primary motivator for establishing modern Hebrew as a national language was the sense of legitimacy it gave the movement, by suggesting a connection between the Jews of ancient Israel and the Jews of the Zionist movement. These developments are seen in Zionist historiography as a revolt against tradition, with the development of Modern Hebrew providing the basis on which a Jewish cultural renaissance might develop.\nThe revival of the Hebrew language and the establishment of Modern Hebrew is most closely associated with the linguist Eliezer Ben-Yehuda and the Committee of the Hebrew Language (later replaced by the Academy of the Hebrew Language).\nConquest of labor.\nIn the early 20th century a more ideologically motivated wave of Zionist immigrants arrived in Palestine. With them, the Zionist movement began to emphasize the so-called \"conquest of labor\", the belief that the employment of exclusively Jewish labor was the pre-condition for the development of an independent Jewish society in Palestine. The goal was to build a \"pure Jewish settlement\" in Palestine on the basis of \"100 per cent Jewish labor\" and the claim to an exclusively Jewish, highly productive economy. The Zionist leadership aimed to establish a fully autonomous and independent Jewish economic sector to create a new type of Jewish society. This new society was intended to reverse the traditional economic structure seen in the Jewish Diaspora, characterized by a high number of middlemen and a scarcity of productive workers. By developing fundamental sectors such as industry, agriculture, and mining, the goal was to \"normalize\" Jewish life that had grown \"abnormal\" as a result of living amongst non-Jews. Most of the Zionist leadership saw it as imperative to employ strictly Jewish workers in order to ensure the Jewish character of the colonies. Another factor, according to Benny Morris, was the worry that \"employment of Arabs would lead to 'Arab values' being passed on to Zionist youth and nourish the colonists' tendency to exploit and abuse their workers\", as well as security concerns.\nThe employment of exclusively Jewish labor was also intended to avoid the development of a national conflict in conjunction with a class-based conflict. The Zionist leadership believed that by excluding Arab workers they would stimulate class conflict only within Arab society and prevent the Jewish-Arab national conflict from attaining a class dimension. While the Zionist settlers of the First Aliyah had ventured to create a \"pure Jewish settlement,\" they did grow to rely on Arab labor due to the lack of availability of Jewish laborers during this period. With the arrival of the more ideologically driven settlers of the second aliyah, the idea of \"avoda ivrit\" would become more central. The future leaders of the Zionist movement saw an existential threat in the employment of Arab labor, motivating the movement to work towards a society based on purely Jewish labor.\nRacial conceptions of Jewish identity.\nIn the late 19th century, amid attempts to apply science to notions of race, some of the founders of Zionism (such as Max Nordau) sought to reformulate conceptions of Jewishness in terms of racial identity and the \"race science\" of the time. They believed that this concept would allow them to build a new framework for collective Jewish identity, and thought that biology might provide \"proof\" for the \"ethnonational myth of common descent\" from the biblical land of Israel. Countering antisemitic claims that Jews were both aliens and a racially inferior people, these Zionists drew on and appropriated elements from various race theories, to argue that only a home for the Jewish people could enable the physical regeneration of the Jewish people and a renaissance of pride in their ancient cultural traditions. According to Nur Masalha, Zionist nationalism embraced pan-Germanic ideologies, which stressed the concept of das v\u00f6lk: people of shared ancestry should pursue separation and establish a unified state.\nThe contrasting assimilationist viewpoint was that Jewishness consisted in an attachment to Judaism as a religion and culture. Both the orthodox and liberal establishments often rejected this idea. Subsequently, Zionist and non-Zionist Jews vigorously debated aspects of this proposition in terms of the merits or otherwise of diaspora life. While Zionism embarked on its project of social engineering in Mandatory Palestine, ethnonationalist politics on the European continent strengthened and, by the 1930s, some German Jews, acting defensively, asserted Jewish collective rights by redefining Jews as a race after Nazism rose to power.\nWith the establishment of Israel in 1948, the \"ingathering of the exiles\", and the Law of Return, the question of Jewish origins and biological unity came to assume particular importance during early nation building. Conscious of this, Israeli medical researchers and geneticists were careful to avoid any language that might resonate with racial ideas. Themes of \"blood logic\" or \"race\" have nevertheless been described as a recurrent feature of modern Jewish thought in both scholarship and popular belief. Despite this, many aspects of the role of race in the formation of Zionist concepts of a Jewish identity were rarely addressed until recently.\nHistory.\nHistorical and religious background.\nThe concept of the \"return\" was a powerful symbol within religious Jewish belief, traditionally emphasizing that their return should be determined by Divine Providence rather than human action. The cultural memory of Jews in the diaspora revered the Land of Israel. Religious tradition held that a future messianic age would usher in their return as a people, a 'return to Zion' commemorated particularly at Passover and in Yom Kippur prayers. The biblical prophecy of \"Kibbutz Galuyot\", the ingathering of exiles in the Land of Israel as foretold by the Prophets, became a central idea in Zionism. The transformation of this religious, and primarily passive connection between Jews and Palestine, into an active, secular, nationalist movement arose in the context of ideological developments within modern European nations in the 19th century. According to Gideon Shimoni, the religious Judaic notion of being a nation was distinct from the modern European notion of nationalism.\nForerunners of Zionism.\nThe forerunners of Zionism, rather than being causally connected to the later development of Zionism, are thinkers and activists who expressed some notion of Jewish national consciousness or advocated for the migration of Jews to Palestine. These attempts were not continuous as national movements typically are. The most notable proto-Zionists were rabbis such as Judah Alkalai and Zvi Hirsch Kalischer. Their idea of Jews as a collective was strongly tied to religious notions distinct from the secular movement referred to as Zionism that developed at the end of the century.\nIn contrast, Moses Hess, who is regarded as the first modern Jewish nationalist, advocated for the establishment of an independent Jewish state in pursuit of the economic and social normalization of the Jewish people. Hess believed that emancipation alone was not a sufficient solution to the problems faced by European Jewry.\nChristian restorationist ideas promoting the migration of Jews to Palestine contributed to the ideological and historical context that gave a sense of credibility to these pre-Zionist initiatives. Restorationist ideas were a prerequisite for the success of Zionism, since although it was created by Jews, Zionism was dependent on support from Christians, although it is unclear how much Christian ideas influenced the early Zionists. Zionism was also dependent on the thinkers of the \"Haskalah\" or Jewish enlightenment, such as Peretz Smolenskin in 1872, although it often depicted it as its opponent.\nEstablishment of the Zionist movement.\nJewish nationalism and emancipation.\nIdeas of Jewish cultural unity developed a specifically political expression in the 1860s as Jewish intellectuals began promoting the idea of Jewish nationalism. This emerged amid the late 19th century European trend of national revivals.\nZionism emerged towards the end of the \"best century\" for Jews who for the first time were allowed as equals into European society and gained access to schools, universities, and professions that were previously closed to them. By the 1870s, Jews had achieved almost complete civic emancipation in all the states of western and central Europe. By 1914, Jews had moved from the margins to the forefront of European society. In the urban centers of Europe and America, Jews played an influential role in professional and intellectual life. During this period, as Jewish assimilation was still progressing most promisingly, some Jewish intellectuals and religious traditionalists framed assimilation as a humiliating negation of Jewish cultural distinctiveness. The development of Zionism and other Jewish nationalist movements grew out of these sentiments. In this sense, Zionism can be read as a response to the Haskala and the challenges of modernity and liberalism, rather than purely a response to antisemitism.\nEmancipation in Eastern Europe progressed more slowly, to the point that Deickoff writes \"social conditions were such that they made the idea of individual assimilation pointless\". Antisemitism, pogroms and official policies in Tsarist Russia led to the emigration of three million Jews in the years between 1882 and 1914, only 1% of which went to Palestine. Those who went to Palestine were driven primarily by ideas of self-determination and Jewish identity, rather than just in response to pogroms or economic insecurity. Zionism's emergence in the late 19th century was among assimilated Central European Jews who, despite their formal emancipation, still felt excluded from high society. Many of these Jews had moved away from traditional religious observances and were largely secular, mirroring a broader trend of secularization in Europe. Despite their efforts to integrate, the Jews of Central and Eastern Europe were frustrated by continued lack of acceptance by the local national movements that tended toward intolerance and exclusivity. For the early Zionists, if nationalism posed a challenge to European Jewry, it also proposed a solution.\nLeon Pinsker, Theodor Herzl and the birth of modern political Zionism.\nIn the wake of the 1881 Russian pogroms, Leo Pinsker, who was previously an assimilationist, came to the conclusion that the root of the Jewish problem was that Jews formed a distinctive element that could not be assimilated. For Pinsker, emancipation could not resolve the problems of the Jewish people. In Pinsker's analysis, Judeophobia was the cause of antisemitism and was primiarily driven by Jews' lack of a homeland. The solution Pinsker proposed in his pamphlet \"Autoemancipation\" (1882) was for Jews to become a \"normal\" nation and acquire a homeland over which Jews would have sovereignty. Pinsker primarily viewed Jewish emigration a solution for dealing with the \"surplus of Jews, the inassimilable residue\" from Eastern Europe who had arrived in Germany in response to the pogroms.\nThe pogroms motivated a small number of Jews to establish various groups in the Pale of Settlement (a region in western Russia) and in Poland, aimed at supporting Jewish emigration to Palestine. The publication of \"Autoemancipation\" provided these groups with an ideological charter around which they would be confederated into Hibbat Zion (\"Lovers of Zion\") in 1887 where Pinsker would take a leading role. The settlements established by Hibbat Zion lacked sufficient funds and were ultimately not very successful but are seen as the first of several aliyahs, or waves of settlement, that led to the eventual establishment of the state of Israel. The conditions in Eastern Europe would eventually provide Zionism with a base of Jews seeking to overcome the challenges of external ostracism, from the Tsarist regime, and internal changes within the Jewish communities there. The groups that formed Hibbat Zion included the Bilu group, which established its first settlement in 1882. Anita Shapira describes the Bilu as serving the role of a prototype for the settlement groups that followed. At the end of the 19th century, Jews remained a small minority in Palestine.\nA key event that put the modern Zionist movement in motion was the Dreyfus affair, which erupted in France in 1894. The case had a profound impact on Central and Western European Jews. Among those who witnessed the event was Herzl.\nAt this point, Zionism remained a scattered movement. In the 1890s, Herzl infused Zionism with a practical urgency and worked to unify the various strands of the movement. The title of Herzl's 1896 manifesto providing the ideological basis for Zionism, , is typically translated as The Jewish State. Herzl sought to establish a state where Jews would be the majority and as a result, politically dominant. Ahad Ha'am, the founder of cultural Zionism, criticized the lack of Jewish cultural activity and creativity in Herzl's envisioned state, which Ha'am referred to as \"the state of the Jews\". He pointed to the envisioned European and German culture of the state where Jews were simply the transmitters of imperialist culture rather than producers or creators of culture. Like Pinsker, Herzl saw antisemitism as a reality that could only be addressed by the territorial concentration of Jews in a Jewish state.\nHerzl's project was purely secular; the selection of Palestine, after considering other locations, was motivated by the credibility the name would give to the movement. From early on, Herzl recognized that Zionism could not succeed without the support of a great power. He hoped that his state would support the great powers' interests and would \"form part of a defensive wall for Europe in Asia, an outpost of civilization against barbarism.\"\nHerzl's efforts led to the First Zionist Congress at Basel in 1897, which created the Zionist Organization (ZO), renamed in 1960 as World Zionist Organization (WZO), and adopted the Basel Program, which codified the official objective of establishing a legally recognized home for the Jewish people in Palestine. The Zionist Organization was to be the main administrative body of the movement and would go on to establish the Jewish Colonial Trust, whose objectives were to encourage European Jewish emigration to Palestine and to assist with the economic development of the colonies.\nTerritories considered.\nThroughout the first decade of the Zionist movement, Herzl and other Zionist figures considered locations for a Jewish state outside of the Land of Israel, such as \"Uganda\" (actually parts of British East Africa that are today in Kenya), Argentina, Cyprus, Mesopotamia, Mozambique, and the Sinai Peninsula. Herzl was initially content with any Jewish self-governed state. Jewish settlement of Argentina was the project of Maurice de Hirsch. It is unclear if Herzl seriously considered this alternative plan; however, he later affirmed that only Palestine could gain enough Jewish support because of the historic ties of Jews with that area. A major concern and driving reason for considering other territories was the Russian pogroms, in particular the Kishinev massacre, and the resulting need for quick resettlement in a safer place.\nEarly Zionist settlement.\nIn the early twentieth century, Zionism advanced by establishing towns, colonies, and an independent monetary system to channel Jewish capital into Palestine. Due to the unstable local economy and fluctuating currency values under Ottoman rule, Zionists created their own financial institutions. Despite their small numbers, the Zionists instilled a fear of territorial displacement in the local population, which led to Palestinian resistance and the settlers' eventual use of military force. Initially, the impact on rural Palestinians was minimal, with only a few villages encountering Jewish colonies. However, after World War I and as Zionist land purchases increased, the rural population began to experience dramatic changes. From almost the beginning of Zionist settlement, Palestinians viewed Zionism as an expansionist endeavor. According to Israeli historian Benny Morris, Zionism was inherently expansionist and always had the goal of turning the entirety of Palestine into a Jewish state. In addition, Morris describes the Zionists as intent on politically and physically dispossessing the Arabs. Early warnings from local leaders in the 1880s about the destabilizing effects of Jewish immigration went largely unheeded until these later developments. By the early 20th century, there were fourteen Zionist settlements in Palestine, established through land purchases from both local and external landowners.\nFrom the outset, the Zionist leadership saw land acquisition as essential to achieving their goal of establishing a Jewish state. This acquisition was strategic, aiming to create a continuous area of Jewish land. The WZO established the Jewish National Fund (JNF) in 1901, with the stated goal \"to redeem the land of Palestine as the inalienable possession of the Jewish people.\" The notion of land \"redemption\" entailed that the land could not be sold and could not be leased to a non-Jew nor should the land be worked by Arabs, though most Zionists continued to employ fellaheen to perform labor on their lands. The land purchased was primarily from absentee landlords, and upon purchase of the land, the tenant farmers who traditionally had rights of usufruct were often expelled. Herzl publicly opposed this dispossession, but wrote privately in his diary: \"We shall try to spirit the penniless population across the border by procuring employment for it in the transit countries, while denying it any employment in our country... Both the process of expropriation and the removal of the poor must be carried out discreetly and circumspectly.\" The arrival of Zionist settlers to Palestine in the late 19th century is widely seen as the start of the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict. Zionists wanted to create a Jewish state in Palestine with as much land, as many Jews, and as few Palestinian Arabs as possible.\nIn 1903, 'the Eretz Israel assembly' was held by Menachem Ussishkin. This assembly marked the beginning of a more formalized Zionist colonization effort. Under his leadership, both professional and political organizations were established, paving the way for a sustained Zionist presence in the region. Ussishkin delineated three methods for the Zionist movement to acquire land: by force and conquest, by expropriation via governmental authority, and by purchase. The only option available to the movement at the moment in his perspective was the last one, \"until at some point we become rulers\".\nSecond Aliyah.\nThe second wave of Zionist settlement came with the Second Aliyah starting in 1904. The settlers of this period laid the foundational elements for the Jewish society in Palestine envisioned by the Zionist movement. They established the first two political parties, the socialist Po'alei Zion and the non-socialist Ha-Po'el Ha-Tza'ir and initiated the first collective agricultural settlements known as kibbutzim, which were fundamental in the formation of the Israeli state. They also formed the first underground military group, Ha-Shomer, which later evolved into the Haganah and eventually became the core of the Israeli army. Many leaders of the Zionist national movement were products of the Second Aliyah. The Zionists of the second aliyah were also more ideologically motivated than those of the first aliyah. In particular, they sought the \"conquest of labor\", which entailed the exclusion of Arabs from the labor market.\nWorld War I period.\nWhile there were 85,000 Jews living in Palestine in 1914, that number went down to 56,000 by 1917. The Arab population also suffered greatly during this time. When the Ottoman Empire entered the war on Germany's side in October 1914, tens of thousands of Russian Jews became enemy citizens, and many opted to leave rather than become Ottoman citizens and be subject to conscription. This gave the Ottomans an opportunity to suppress the Zionist movement. The war also had a negative effect on trade in Yishuv. On January 17, 1914, the Ottomans announced, with no prior warning, that all foreign nationals must immediately board a ship in Jaffa to be taken to Alexandria. In April 1917, the Ottomans orders all Jews to leave Jaffa. In October 1917, after the Ottomans discovered that Nili had been giving intelligence to the British, they arrested people at random and imposed a curfew as collective punishment. Most Zionists came to the conclusion that there was no hope of change under the Ottomans and therefore supported the British conquest of Palestine, and they viewed the British as redeemers.\nAt the start of World War I, the Zionist leadership attempted to persuade the British government of the benefits of sponsoring a Jewish colony in Palestine. Their main initial success was in establishing a lobbying group centered around the Rothschild family, largely driven by Chaim Weizmann. In the 1917 Balfour Declaration, Britain declared its support for \"the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people\". The declaration was largely motivated by war-time considerations and antisemitic preconceptions about the putative influence Jews had on the Tsarist government and in the shaping of American policy. Though his decision was also motivated by religious convictions, Balfour himself had passed the Aliens Act 1905, which aimed to keep Eastern European Jews out of Britain. More decisive were Britain's colonial and imperial geopolitical goals in the region, specifically in retaining control over the Suez Canal by establishing a pro-British state in the region. Weizmann's role in obtaining the Balfour Declaration led to his election as the Zionist movement's leader. He remained in that role until 1948, and then was elected as the first President of Israel after the nation gained independence.\nWeizmann's ultimate goal was the establishment of a Jewish state, even beyond the borders of \"Greater Israel.\" For Weizmann, Palestine was a Jewish and not an Arab country. The state he sought would contain the east bank of the Jordan River and extend from the Litani River (in present-day Lebanon). Weizmann's strategy involved incrementally approaching this goal over a long period, in the form of settlement and land acquisition. Weizmann was open to the idea of Arabs and Jews jointly running Palestine through an elected council with equal representation, but he did not view the Arabs as equal partners in negotiations about the country's future. In particular, he was steadfast in his view of the \"moral superiority\" of the Jewish claim to Palestine over the Arab claim and believed these negotiations should be conducted solely between Britain and the Jews. According to Zionist Israeli historian Simha Flapan, the essential assumptions of Weizmann's strategy were later adopted by David Ben-Gurion and subsequent Zionist leaders.\nKing\u2013Crane Commission.\n In 1919, the US-based King\u2013Crane Commission started with a strongly sympathetic disposition towards Zionism but concluded that the maximum Zionist demands implied subjection of Palestinians to Jewish rule and that this was a violation of the principle of self-determination, given the anti-Zionist sentiment of the non-Jewish population. The report stated that \"The initial claim, often submitted by Zionist representatives, that they have a 'right' to Palestine based on occupation of two thousand years ago, can barely be seriously considered.\" Consequently, it recommended a considerably \"modified\" or \"reduced\" version of the Zionist programme, with Palestine as a Jewish national home but not a Jewish state.\nBeginning of Revisionist Zionism.\nZe'ev Jabotinsky founded the Revisionist Party in 1925, which took on a more militant ethos and openly maximalist agenda than Weizmann and Ben-Gurion. Jabotinsky rejected Weizmann's strategy of incremental state building, instead preferring to immediately declare sovereignty over the entire region, which extended to both the East and West bank of the Jordan river. Like Weizmann and Herzl, Jabotinsky also believed that the support of a Great Power was essential to the success of Zionism. From early on, Jabotinksy openly rejected the possibility of a \"voluntary agreement\" with the Arabs of Palestine. He instead believed in building an \"iron wall\" of Jewish military force to break Arab resistance to Zionism, at which point an agreement could be established. Jabotinsky's \"iron wall\" strategy would have a lasting effect on the Zionist perspective towards the demographic problem posed by the presence of the local Palestinian population. Both the left and right factions of Zionism would rely on this strategy of leveraging military strength in pursuit of political aspirations.\nBritish Mandate and development of the Zionist quasi-state.\nAfter the war, the plan for a greater Arab kingdom under the Hashemite family was abandoned when King Faisal was expelled from Damascus by the French in 1920. In parallel, the Zionist demand for a clear British acknowledgment of the entirety of Palestine as the Jewish national home was rejected. Instead, Britain committed only to establishing a Jewish national home \"in Palestine\" and promised to facilitate this without prejudicing the rights of existing \"non-Jewish communities\"\u2014these qualifying statements aroused the concern of Zionist leaders at the time.\nThe British mandate over Palestine, established in 1922, was based on the Balfour Declaration, explicitly privileging the Jewish minority over the Arab majority. In addition to declaring British support for the establishment of a \"Jewish national home\" in Palestine, the mandate included provisions facilitating Jewish immigration, and granting the Zionist movement the status of representing Jewish national interests. In particular, the Jewish Agency, the embodiment of the Zionist movement in Palestine, was made a partner of the mandatory government, acquiring international diplomatic status and representing Zionist interests before the League of Nations and other international venues.\nThe British mandate effectively established a Jewish quasi-state in Palestine, lacking only full sovereignty. This lack of sovereignty was crucial for Zionism at this early stage, as the Jewish population was too small to defend itself against the Arabs of Palestine. The British presence provided a necessary safeguard for Jewish nationalism. To achieve political independence, Jews needed Britain's support, particularly in land purchase and immigration. Following the Balfour Declaration, Jewish immigration to Palestine grew from 9,149 immigrants in 1921 to 33,801 in 1925\u2014by the end of the mandate period, the Jewish population in Palestine nearly tripled, eventually reaching one third of the country's population.\nThe mandatory administration implemented policies that favored the development of the capitalist sector, predominantly associated with the Jewish community, while disadvantaging the Arab non-capitalist sector. Between 1933 and 1937, government spending was concentrated in two main areas\u2014development and economic services, and defense\u2014with the former focusing on infrastructural improvements (such as railways, roads, bridges, and other public works) that were particularly beneficial for capitalist production. In contrast to the Jewish population, the Arabs did not benefit from any government protections such as social security, employment benefits, trade union protection, job security and training opportunities. Arab wages were one third of their Jewish counterparts (including when paid by the same employer). The mandate also included an article describing self-governing institutions intended only for the Jewish population of Palestine. No similar support or recognition was provided to the Arab majority during the time of the mandate.\nBy enabling the Zionist institutions to serve as a parallel government to the Mandate, the British facilitated the separation of the economy and legitimized their quasi-state status. Accordingly, these institutions, which purported to act in the interests of Jews everywhere, were able to funnel resources into the Jewish sector in Palestine, heavily subsidizing the dominant Jewish economy. The nucleus of the Jewish quasi-state was the Histadrut, established in 1920 as an independent social, political and economic institution. The Histadrut also exercised significant control over the Haganah, a Jewish defense force formed in 1920 in reaction to Arab riots. Originally created to defend the community, Haganah evolved into a permanent underground reserve army fully integrated into the Jewish political structure. Although the British authorities disapproved of the Haganah, particularly its method of stealing arms from British bases, they did not disband it. The Histadrut operated as a completely independent entity, without interference from the British mandate authorities. Ben-Gurion saw the Histadrut's detachment from socialist ideology to be one of its key strengths; indeed it was the General Organization of Workers in Israel. In particular, the Histadrut worked towards national unity and aimed to dominate the capitalist system en route to gaining political power, not to create a socialist utopia.\nAs secretary general of the Histadrut and leader of the Zionist labor movement, Ben-Gurion adopted similar strategies and objectives as Weizmann during this period, disagreeing primarily on issues of specific tactical moves up until 1939. The middle class grew dramatically in size with the arrival of the fourth aliyah in 1924, motivating a political shift within the labor movement. It was during this period that the political strategy of the labor movement would solidify. The founding of the Mapai party unified the labor movement, making it the dominant force. The party saw economic control as essential to facilitating Zionist settlement and achieving political power: \"the economic question is not one of class; it is a national question\". For Ben-Gurion, the transformation from \"working class to nation\" was intertwined with his rejection of diaspora life, as he would declare: the \"weak, unproductive, parasitical Jewish masses\" must be converted \"to productive labor\" in service of the nation.\nZionist policies and the 1936\u20131939 Arab Revolt.\nFor the Zionist movement, economic development and policies were a mechanism by which political aims could be achieved. A new economic sector exclusively for Jews, controlled by the Labor Zionist movement, was established with support from the Jewish National Fund and the agricultural workers' Histadrut. Despite the universalist ideals of Zionist pioneering, this new Jewish economic sector was fundamentally based on exclusionary practices. The goal of achieving \"100 percent of Hebrew labour\" was the primary driver of the territorial, economic and social separation between Jews and Arabs.\nThe Zionist economic platform was partially based on the assumption (eventually demonstrated incorrect) that economic benefits to the Arabs of Palestine would pacify opposition to the movement. For the Zionist leadership, the economic status and development of the Arabs of Palestine should be compared with Arabs of other countries, rather than with the Jews of Palestine. Accordingly, disproportionate gains in Jewish development were acceptable as long as the status of the Arab sector did not worsen. While British support for Zionist aspirations in Palestine established the parameters within which the Arab economy could develop, Zionist policies reinforced these limitations. Most notable are the exclusion of Arab labor from Jewish enterprise and the expulsion of Arab peasants from Jewish-owned land. Both of these had limited impact in scope but reinforced the structural limitations put in place by British policies.\nWith the rise to power of the Nazis in 1933, the Jewish community was increasingly persecuted and driven out. The discriminatory immigration laws of the US, UK and other countries preferable to German Jews, led to in 1935 alone more than 60,000 Jews arriving in Palestine (more than the total number of Jews in Palestine as of the establishment of the Balfour declaration in 1917). Ben-Gurion would subsequently declare that immigration at this rate would allow for the maximalist Zionist goal of a Jewish state in all of Palestine. The Arab community openly pressured the mandatory government to restrict Jewish immigration and land purchases.\nSporadic attacks in the countryside (described by Zionists and the British as \"banditry\") reflected widespread anger over the Zionist land purchases that displaced local peasants. Meanwhile, in urban areas, protests against British rule and the increasing influence of the Zionist movement intensified and became more militant in the early 1930s.\nThe outbreak of violence in the course of the 1936 Arab Revolt was a turning point in Jewish-Arab relations, unifying previously divided factions within the Zionist movement and leading them to view the use of force as a necessary means of defense and deterrence.\nDuring the revolt, the Irgun Zvai Leumi engaged in the use of terror attacks against the Arabs of Palestine. Similarly, for the labor Zionist Palmah, the lines delineating what was acceptable and unacceptable while dealing with Arab villagers were \"vague and intentionally blurred\". These ambiguous limits practically did not differ from those of the self-described \"terrorist\" group, Irgun. According to Anita Shapira, beginning in this period, Labor Zionism's use of violence against Palestinians for political means was essentially the same as that of radical conservative Zionist groups.\nThe Peel Commission partition proposal.\nIn response to the revolt, the British appointed in 1937 a commission of inquiry that eventually recommended the partition of the land. The proposal included creating a small Jewish state occupying 17 percent of Mandatory Palestine's territory, while Jerusalem and a corridor to the sea would remain under British control, and the remaining 75 percent of the territory would form a Palestinian state connected to Transjordan under King Abdullah's rule. At this point, Jews owned 5.6% of the land in Palestine; the land allocated to the Jewish state would contain 40 percent of the country's fertile land.\nThe commission also proposed a population transfer of the Palestinian Arabs from the areas designated for the Jewish state, based on the precedent of the 1923 Greek-Turkish population exchange. For Ben-Gurion, the transfer proposal was the most appealing recommendation put forward by the commission. Indeed, this sentiment was deeply ingrained to the extent that Ben Gurion's acceptance of partition was contingent upon the removal of the Palestinian population.\nThe Zionist leadership viewed the mass transfer of the Arabs as morally permissible, but were unsure of its political effectiveness. Much of the Zionist leadership spoke in strong support of the transfer plan, asserting that there is nothing immoral about it. Within the Zionist movement, two perspectives developed with respect to the partition proposal; the first was a complete rejection of partition, the second was acceptance of the idea of partition on the basis that it would eventually allow for expansion to all territories within \"the boundaries of Zionist aspirations.\". It was the right wing of the Zionist movement that put forward the main arguments against transfer, with Jabotinsky strongly objecting it on moral grounds, and others mainly focusing on its impracticality. However, in his last book \"The Jewish War Front\" published in 1940, after the outbreak of WWII, Jabotinsky no longer ruled out the possibility of voluntary population transfer, though he still didn't view it as a necessary solution. Some leaders, such as Ruppin, Motzkin, and writers such as Israel Zangwill, also referred to transfer as a \"voluntary\" action that would include some form of compensation. However, \"Palestine's Arabs did not wish to evacuate the land of their ancestors... The matter raised ethical questions that troubled the Yishuv\". The revolt was inflamed by the partition proposal and continued until 1939 when it was forcefully suppressed by the British.\nLater, Vladimir Jabotinsky, the right-wing Zionist leader, drew inspiration from the Nazi demographic policies that resulted in the expulsion of 1.5 million Poles and Jews, in whose place Germans resettled. In Jabotinsky's assessment:The world has become accustomed to the idea of mass migrations and has almost become fond of them. Hitler\u2014as odious as he is to us\u2014has given this idea a good name in the world.\nBy the time of the 1936 Arab revolt, almost all groups within the Zionist movement wanted a Jewish state in Palestine, \"whether they declared their intent or preferred to camouflage it, whether or not they perceived it as a political instrument, whether they saw sovereign independence as the prime aim, or accorded priority to the task of social construction\". The main debates within the movement at this time were concerning partition of Palestine and the nature of the relationship with the British. The intensity of the revolt, Britain's ambiguous support for the movement and the increasing threat against European Jewry during this period motivated the Zionist leadership to prioritize immediate considerations. The movement ultimately favored the notion of partition, primarily out of practical considerations and partially out of a belief that establishing a Jewish state over all of Palestine would remain an option. At the 1937 Zionist congress, the Zionist leadership adopted the stance that the land allocated to the Jewish state by the partition plan was inadequate\u2014effectively rejecting the partition plan that faded away in the face of both Arab and Zionist opposition.\nIn response to Ben-Gurion's 1938 quote that \"politically we are the aggressors and they [the Palestinians] defend themselves\", Israeli historian Benny Morris says, \"Ben-Gurion, of course, was right. Zionism was a colonizing and expansionist ideology and movement\", and that \"Zionist ideology and practice were necessarily and elementally expansionist.\" Morris describes the Zionist goal of establishing a Jewish state in Palestine as necessarily displacing and dispossessing the Arab population.\nNazism, World War II and the Holocaust.\nIn 1939, a British White Paper recommended limiting Jewish immigration and land purchase with the objective of maintaining the status quo while the threat of war loomed in Europe. The immigration was to be limited to no more than 75,000 people over the next five years. With Nazi expansionism in Europe, the limits on immigration prompted further militarization, land takeover and illegal immigration efforts by the Zionist movement. World War II broke out as the Zionists were developing their campaign against the White Paper\u2014unable to accept the White Paper or to side against the British, the Zionist movement would ultimately support the British war effort while working to upend the White Paper. From the start of the second world war, the Zionists pressured the British to organize and train a Jewish \"army\", culminating in the establishment of a Jewish Brigade and accompanying blue and white flag. The development of this force would further train and enable the already substantial Zionist military capacity. The Haganah was allowed by the British to openly acquire weapons and worked with the British to prepare for a possible Axis invasion.\nDespite the White Paper, Zionist immigration and settlement efforts continued during the war period. While immigration had previously been selective, once the details of the Holocaust reached Palestine in 1942, selectivity was abandoned. The official Zionist movement's war effort focused on the survival and development of the Yishuv; Pappe argues that scarce Zionist energy was deployed in support of European Jews. Many of those fleeing Nazi terror in Europe preferred to leave for the United States, however, strict American immigration policies and Zionist efforts led to 10% of the 3 million Jews leaving Europe to settle in Palestine.\nIn the Biltmore Program of 1942, the Zionist movement would openly declare for the first time its goal of establishing a Jewish state in all of Palestine. At this point, the United States, with its growing economy and unprecedented military force, became a focal point of Zionist political activity that engaged with the American electorate and politicians. American President Truman supported the Biltmore program for the duration of his time in office, largely motivated by humanitarian concerns and the growing influence of the Zionist lobby.\nDuring World War II, as the horrors of the Holocaust became known, the Zionist leadership formulated the One Million Plan, a reduction from Ben-Gurion's previous target of two million immigrants. Following the end of the war, many stateless refugees, mainly Holocaust survivors, began migrating to Palestine in small boats in defiance of British rules. The Holocaust united much of the rest of world Jewry behind the Zionist project. The British either imprisoned these Jews in Cyprus or sent them to the British-controlled Allied Occupation Zones in Germany. The British, having faced Arab revolts, were now facing opposition by Zionist groups in Palestine for subsequent restrictions on Jewish immigration. In January 1946 the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry, a joint British and American committee, was tasked to examine political, economic and social conditions in Mandatory Palestine and the well-being of the peoples now living there; to consult representatives of Arabs and Jews, and to make other recommendations 'as necessary' for an interim handling of these problems as well as for their eventual solution. Following the failure of the 1946\u201347 London Conference on Palestine, at which the United States refused to support the British, leading to both the Morrison\u2013Grady Plan and the Bevin Plan being rejected by all parties, the British decided to refer the question to the UN on February 14, 1947.\nEnd of the Mandate and expulsion of the Palestinians.\nTowards the end of the war, the Zionist leadership was motivated more than ever to establish a Jewish state. Since the British were no longer sponsoring its development, many Zionists considered it would be necessary to establish the state by force by upending the British position in Palestine. In this the IRA's tactics against Britain in the Irish War of Independence served as a both a model and source of inspiration. The Irgun, the military arm of the revisionist Zionists, and Lehi, who at one point sought an alliance with the Nazis, would lead a series of terrorist attacks against the British starting in 1944. This included the King David Hotel bombing, British immigration and tax offices and police stations. It was only by the war's end that the Haganah joined in the sabotage against the British. The combined impact of US opinion and the attacks on British presence eventually led the British to refer the situation to the United Nations in 1947. In response to a United Kingdom government request that the General Assembly \"make recommendations under article 10 of the Charter, concerning the future government of Palestine\", the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP) was created on 15 May 1947.\nThe urgency of the condition of the Jewish refugees in Europe motivated the committee to unanimously vote in favor of terminating the British mandate in Palestine. The disagreement came with regards to whether Palestine should be partitioned or if it should constitute a federal state. American lobbying efforts, pressuring UN delegates with the threat of withdrawal of US aid, eventually secured the General Assembly votes in favor of the partition of Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states, which was passed 29 November 1947.\nOutbursts of violence slowly grew into a wider civil war between the Arabs and Zionist militias. By mid-December, the Haganah had shifted to a more \"aggressive defense\", abandoning notions of restraint it had espoused from 1936 to 1939. The Haganah reprisal raids were often disproportionate to the initial Arab offenses, which led to the spread of violence to previously unaffected areas. The Zionist militias, employed terror attacks against Arab civilian and militia centers and many Palestinians were evicted from their houses. In response, Arabs planted bombs in Jewish civilian areas, particularly in Jerusalem.\nThe first expulsion of Palestinians began 12 days after the adoption of the UN resolution, and the first Palestinian village was eliminated a month later, in retaliation for Palestinian attacks on convoys and Jewish settlements. In March 1948, Zionist forces began implementing Plan D, an ethnic cleansing operation that involved the expulsion of civilians and the destruction of Arab towns and villages in pursuit of eliminating Palestinians seen as potentially hostile, resulting in the loss of Palestine to much of its indigenous population. According to Benny Morris Zionist forces committed 24 massacres of Palestinians in the ensuing war, in part as a form of psychological warfare, the most notorious of which is the Deir Yassin massacre. The United Nations Conciliation Commission for Palestine estimated that between 1948 and 1949, 710,000 Palestinians were driven out of the country and another 40,000 were internally displaced, primarily as a result of these expulsions and massacres.\nThe British left Palestine (having done little to maintain order) on May 14 as planned. The British did not facilitate a formal transfer of power; a fully functioning Jewish quasi-state had already been operating under the British for the past several decades. The same day, Ben-Gurion declared the establishment of the state of Israel. The Declaration of Independence of Israel described a democracy with equality of social and political rights for all citizens, and extended a peace offering to neighboring states and their Arab citizens. Masalha notes that the declaration states equality on the basis of citizenship but not nationality.\nThe ensuing war led to the State of Israel establishing control over 78% of Mandatory Palestine, instead of the 55% outlined in the UN partition plan, and resulted in the destruction of much of Palestinian society and the Arab landscape. This war, led by the Zionist Yishuv was framed by its leaders in biblical and messianic terms as a 'miraculous clearing of the land,' akin to the biblical War of Joshua. Masalha writes that it is not clear who the Yishuv was declaring independence from, as it was neither from the British colonial rule, which facilitated Jewish settlement against Palestinian wishes, nor from the land's indigenous inhabitants, who had long cultivated and owned it. After the 1949 Armistice Agreements, a series of laws passed by the first Israeli government prevented displaced Palestinians from claiming private property or returning on the state's territories. They and many of their descendants remain refugees supported by UNRWA.\nHebraization of names.\nAs part of the effort to consolidate its new ownership over the land it had taken over in the 1948 war, the Israeli state worked towards \"erasing all traces of its former owners\". The project of \"Hebraization\" of the map, for which the JNF Naming Committee was established, aimed to replace what remained of the Arab towns and villages with newly named Israeli settlements. These names were often based on the Arab names but with a \"Hebrew pronunciation\" or based on old Hebrew biblical names. This effort also sought to demonstrate continuous Jewish ownership over the land to ancient times.\nPrior to 1948, the Zionist movement had limited authority over the use of place names in Palestine. After 1948, the name \"Palestine\" was removed from Zionist organizations; for example, the Jewish Agency for Palestine, which played a critical role in the founding of the Israeli state in 1948 was renamed to the \"Jewish Agency for Israel\".\nPost-World War II.\nSince the creation of the State of Israel, the World Zionist Organization has functioned mainly as an organization dedicated to assisting and encouraging Jews to migrate to Israel. It has provided political support for Israel in other countries but plays little role in internal Israeli politics. The movement's major success since 1948 was in providing logistical support for Jewish migrants and refugees and, most importantly, in assisting Soviet Jews in their struggle with the authorities over the right to leave the USSR and to practice their religion in freedom, and the exodus of 850,000 Jews from the Arab world, mostly to Israel. In 1944\u201345, Ben-Gurion described the One Million Plan to foreign officials as being the \"primary goal and top priority of the Zionist movement.\" The immigration restrictions of the British White Paper of 1939 meant that such a plan could not be put into large scale effect until the Israeli Declaration of Independence in May 1948. The new country's immigration policy had some opposition within the new Israeli government, such as those who argued that there was \"no justification for organizing large-scale emigration among Jews whose lives were not in danger, particularly when the desire and motivation were not their own\" as well as those who argued that the absorption process caused \"undue hardship\". However, the force of Ben-Gurion's influence and insistence ensured that his immigration policy was carried out.\nReligious Zionism and the Six-Day War.\nPrior to the 1967 Six-Day War, religious Zionism mostly described support for political Zionism among Orthodox Jews. However, the war and the Israeli conquest of the West Bank, invigorated and popularized a religious Zionist ideology associated with the Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook and the Mercaz HaRav yeshiva, which believes that Zionism is a part of the historical process that will bring about the messianic age. This ideology considered secular Zionism and secular state policies to be holy and part God's divine plan: \"The spirit of Israel... is so closely linked to the spirit of God that a Jewish nationalist, no matter how secularist his intention may be, is, despite himself, imbued with the divine spirit even against his own will.\"\nAccording to followers of the Mercaz HaRav ideology, the Six Day War was a demonstration of the work of the Divine Hand and the \"beginning of redemption\". Proponents of this ideology venerate the land as sacred, and consider its sanctity a core principle of religious Zionism. Religious Zionists view the settlement of the West Bank as a commandment of God, necessary for the redemption of the Jewish people. Rabbi Zvi Yehuda Kook, a major religious Zionist leader and thinker, would declare in 1967 following the Six Day War in the presence of Israeli leadership including the president, ministers, members of the Knesset, judges, chief rabbis and senior civil servants:\n I tell you explicitly... that there is a prohibition in the Torah against giving up even an inch of our liberated land. There are no conquests here and we are not occupying foreign land; we are returning to our home, to the inheritance of our forefathers. There is no Arab land here, only the inheritance of our God\u2014the more the world gets used to this thought the better it will be for it and for all of us.\nIn the 1970s, religious Zionists, such as Shlomo Aviner and Hanan Porat, campaigned against Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and Sinai Peninsula. Religious Zionist ideology motivated the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin in 1995, who ceded some territory to the PLO as a part of the Oslo Accords, and several religious Zionist rabbis reacted to the assassination with approval.\nTypes of Zionism.\nFrom the turn of the century until the Arab revolt of 1936, there was room for political flexibility within the Zionist movement, many scholars argue that different currents of Zionism have had a shared core framework. Most mainstream histories of the movement delineate a few key strains, many following a taxonomy introduced during the period starting in the late 19th century and continuing into the 1930s: political, practical, socialist, cultural and revisionist. Some scholars emphasise the heterogeneity of these strains of Zionism.\nEarly Zionist Strains: Political and practical Zionism.\nPolitical Zionism was led by Theodor Herzl and Max Nordau. This approach was espoused at the Zionist Organization's First Zionist Congress. It focused on a Jewish home as a solution to the \"Jewish question\" and antisemitism in Europe, centered on gaining Jewish sovereignty (probably within the Ottoman or later British or French empire), and was opposed to mass migration until after sovereignty was granted. It initially considered locations other than Palestine (e.g., in Africa) and did not foresee migration by many Western Jews to the new homeland.\nKnown in Hebrew as , Practical Zionism was led by Moshe Leib Lilienblum and Leon Pinsker and molded by the Hovevei Zion organization. It became dominant after Herzl's death, and differed from Political Zionism in not seeing Zionism as justified primarily by the Jewish Question but rather as an end in itself; it \"aspired to the establishment of an elite utopian community in Palestine\" through Aliyah. It also differed from Political Zionism in \"distrust[ing] grand political actions\" and preferring \"an evolutionary incremental process toward the establishment of the national home\".\nThese initially dominant strains faded after the First World War and Balfour Declaration.\nLabor Zionism.\nLed by socialists Nachman Syrkin, Haim Arlosoroff, Berl Katznelson, and Marxist Ber Borochov, Labor or Socialist Zionism was a form of Zionism that combined messianic tendencies and socialist or social democratic politics. The labor Zionists promoted immigration and settlement, establishing \"facts on the ground\" as the main path towards state-building.\nLabor Zionism became a mass movement with the founding of Poale Zion (\"Workers of Zion\") groups in Eastern and Western Europe and North America in the 1900s. Poale Zion split between Left and Right after 1917. In 1919, the Right Poale Zion in Palestine disbanded to form the nationalist socialist Ahdut HaAvoda, led by David Ben Gurion; in 1930, it merged with Hapoel Hatzair, founded by A. D. Gordon, to form Mapai. Labor Zionism, represented by Mapai, became the dominant force in the political and economic life of the Yishuv during the British Mandate of Palestine. It was the dominant ideology of the political establishment in Israel until the 1977 election, when the Israeli Labor Party was defeated. During the early twentieth century, the left wing of this tradition was represented by Hashomer Hatzair, followed by Mapam in the late twentieth century, and Meretz until 2022.\n In Labor Zionist thought, a revolution of the Jewish soul and society was believed necessary and achievable in part by Jews moving to Israel and becoming farmers, workers, and soldiers in a country of their own. Labor Zionists established rural communes in Israel called \"kibbutzim\", a form of cooperative agriculture in which the Jewish National Fund hired Jewish workers under trained supervision. The kibbutzim were a symbol of the Second Aliyah in that they put great emphasis on communalism and egalitarianism, representing Utopian socialism to a certain extent. Furthermore, they stressed self-sufficiency, which became an essential aspect of Labor Zionism.\nSynthetic and General Zionism.\nSynthetic Zionism, led by Chaim Weizmann, Leo Motzkin and Nahum Sokolow, was an approach that advocated a combination of practical and political Zionism and distanced themselves from the growing Labour, Religious and Revisionist Zionist groups as the movement became polarised between those. General Zionists identified with the liberal European middle class to which many Zionist leaders such as Herzl and Chaim Weizmann aspired. As head of the World Zionist Organization, Weizmann's policies had a sustained impact on the Zionist movement, with Abba Eban describing him as a dominant figure in Jewish life during the interwar period.\nRevisionist Zionism.\nRevisionist Zionism, developed by Ze'ev Jabotinsky in the 1920s, was a right-wing strain of Zionism. It initially believed that a Jewish state must expand to both sides of the Jordan River, i.e. taking Transjordan in addition to all of Palestine. It broke with the WZO in 1935 because of the latter's refusal to declare the establishment of a Jewish state as its immediate aim, and had its own paramilitary organisation, Irgun, from 1931 to 1948.\nFollowers of Revisionist Zionism developed the Likud Party in Israel, which has dominated most governments since 1977. It advocates Israel's maintaining control of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and takes a hard-line approach in the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict.\nReligious Zionism.\nInitially led by Yitzchak Yaacov Reines and by Abraham Isaac Kook, Religious Zionism is a variant of Zionist ideology that combines religious conservatism and secular nationalism into a theology with patriotism as its basis. One of the core ideas in Religious Zionism is the belief that the ingathering of exiles in the Land of Israel and the establishment of Israel is the beginning of the redemption, the initial stage of the \"geula\".\nAfter the Six-Day War and the capture of the West Bank, a territory referred to by the movement as Judea and Samaria, the movement turned right as it integrated revanchist and irredentist forms of nationalism; this right-wing form of religious Zionism, powerful within the settlement movement, is represented today by Gush Emunim (founded by students of Abraham Kook's son Zvi Yehuda Kook in 1974), Jewish Home (HaBayit HaYehudi, formed in 2009), Tkuma, and Meimad.\nKahanism, a radical branch of religious Zionism, was founded by Rabbi Meir Kahane, whose party, Kach, was eventually banned from the Knesset, but has been increasingly influential on Israeli politics.\nLiberal Zionism.\nToday, the liberal Zionist perspective criticizes the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory since 1967 while also promoting the idea of a Jewish state as a necessity. In this vein, liberal Zionism sees Zionist and Israeli activity before 1967, such as the military conquest of Palestine and the expulsion of Palestinians in 1948, as a necessity.\nLiberal Zionism, although not associated with any single party in modern Israel, remains a strong trend in Israeli politics advocating free market principles, democracy and adherence to human rights.\nPhilosopher Carlo Strenger describes a modern-day version of Liberal Zionism, rooted in the original ideology of Herzl and Ahad Ha'am. It is marked by a concern for democratic values and human rights, freedom to criticize government policies without accusations of disloyalty, and rejection of excessive religious influence in public life. Liberal Zionists see that \"Jewish history shows that Jews need and are entitled to a nation-state of their own. But they also think that this state must be a liberal democracy, which means that there must be strict equality before the law independent of religion, ethnicity or gender.\"\nCultural Zionism.\nCultural Zionism or Spiritual Zionism is a strain of Zionism that focused on creating a center in historic Palestine with its own secular Jewish culture and national history, including language and historical roots, rather than on mass migration or state-building. The founder of Cultural Zionism was Asher Ginsberg, better known as Ahad Ha'am. Like Hibbat Zion and unlike Herzl, Ha'am saw Palestine as the spiritual centre of Jewish life. Ha'am inaugurated the movement in his 1880 essay \"This is not the way\", which called for the cultivation of a qualitative Jewish presence in the land over [the] quantitative one\" pursued by Hibbat Zion. Ha'am was also a sharp critic of Herzl; spiritual Zionism believed that the realpolitik engaged in by Political Zionism corrupted Jewry, and opposed any political solutions that victimised non-Jewish people in the land.\nBrit Shalom, which promoted Arab-Jewish cooperation, was established in 1925 by supporters of Ahad Ha'am's Spiritual Zionism, including Martin Buber, Gershom Scholem, Hans Kohn, \"and other important figures of the intellectual elite of the pre-independence \"yishuv\", Gorny describes it as an ultimately marginal group.\nNon-Jewish support.\nChristian support.\nFrom the beginning of the Zionist movement's development, it was dependent on support from the Christian world. The Christian restorationist movement held the belief that the \"return\" of Jews to Palestine would trigger the second coming of the Messiah, the resurrection of the dead, and ultimately lead to the conversion of the Jews to Christianity. In this sense, according to Penslar, Christian ideas of \"restoration\" were a prerequisite for the success of Zionism.\nChristian Zionism is primarily driven by the belief that the return of Jews to the Holy Land will either lead to their conversion to Christianity or their destruction. This belief is criticized by Gershom Gorenberg in his book \"The End of Days,\" where he highlights the troubling aspect of this messianic scenario\u2014the disappearance of Jews. Evangelical figures such as Jerry Falwell believe the establishment of Israel is a pivotal event signaling the Second Coming of Christ and the eventual End times. As a result, Christian Zionists have significantly contributed politically and financially to Israeli nationalist forces, with the understanding that Israel's role is to facilitate the Second Coming of Christ and the elimination of Judaism.\nOne of the principal Protestant teachers who promoted the biblical doctrine that the Jews would return to their national homeland was John Nelson Darby. His doctrine of dispensationalism is credited with promoting Zionism, following his 11 lectures on the hopes of the church, the Jew and the gentile given in Geneva in 1840. However, others like C H Spurgeon, both Horatius and Andrew Bonar, Robert Murray M'Chyene, and J C Ryle were among a number of prominent proponents of both the importance and significance of a Jewish return, who were not dispensationalist. Pro-Zionist views were embraced by many evangelicals and also affected international foreign policy.\nThe largest Zionist organisation is Christians United for Israel, which has 10 million members and is led by John Hagee.\nDruze support.\nWhile most Israeli Druze identify as ethnically Arab, today, tens of thousands of Israeli Druze belong to \"Druze Zionist\" movements. A survey conducted in 2008 by Dr. Yusuf Hassan of Tel Aviv University found that out of 764 Druze participants, more than 94% identify as \"Druze-Israelis\" in the religious and national context. In 1973, Amal Nasser el-Din founded the Zionist Druze Circle, a group whose aim was to encourage the Druze to support the state of Israel.\nThe Druze have aligned themselves more with the Zionist ethos and have distanced themselves from other Arab and Islamic nationalist causes in Israeli society. Israeli Druze citizens serve in the Israel Defense Forces. The Jewish-Druze partnership was often referred to as \"a covenant of blood\" () in recognition of the shared responsibility of defending Israel.\nHindu support.\nBefore and after Israel's creation in 1948, the Indian National Congress and the Indian government initially opposed Zionism.\nZionism, seen as a national liberation movement for the repatriation of the Jewish people to their homeland then under British colonial rule, appealed to many Hindu nationalists, who viewed their struggle for independence from British rule and the Partition of India as national liberation for long-oppressed Hindus. Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India, drew a connection between the conflict in Palestine and Hindu-Muslim relations in India, calling it a British \"imperialist diversion.\"\nIn more current times, conservative Indian parties and organizations tend to support Zionism. A 2012 international opinion survey found that India was the most pro-Israel country in the world. This has invited attacks on the Hindutva movement by parts of the Indian left opposed to Zionism, and allegations that Hindus are conspiring with the \"Jewish Lobby.\"\nAnti-Zionism.\nZionism has been criticized and opposed by a wide variety of organizations and individuals. Until World War II, anti-Zionism was widespread among Jews for varying reasons. Orthodox Jews opposed Zionism on religious grounds, as preempting the Messiah. Many secular or assimilationist Jewish anti-Zionists identified more with ideals of the Enlightenment and saw Zionism as a reactionary ideology, while left-wing Jews (including in the Bund) believed that the Jewish question was best solved in the diaspora through building a socialist society.\nOpposition to Zionism in the Jewish diaspora was surmounted only from the 1930s onward, as conditions for Jews deteriorated radically in Europe and, with the Second World War, the sheer scale of the Holocaust was felt. Thereafter, Jewish anti-Zionist groups generally either disintegrated or transformed into pro-Zionist organizations, though many small groups, and bodies like the American Council for Judaism, conserved an earlier Reform tradition of rejection of Zionism.\nThere was a shift in the meaning of anti-Zionism after the events of the 1940s. Whereas pre-1948 anti-Zionism was against the hypothetical establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine, post-1948 anti-Zionism had to contend with the existence of the State of Israel. This often meant taking a retaliatory position to the new reality of Jewish sovereignty in the Middle East. The overriding impulse of post-1948 anti-Zionism is to dismantle the current State of Israel and replace it with something else.\nOpposition to Zionism was overwhelmingly common among the non-Jewish communities of Palestine from the 1880s onwards. Palestinian nationalism, the national movement of the Palestinians that espouses self-determination and sovereignty over the region of Palestine, cohered in the early 20th century, along with broader Arab nationalism and the ideology of Greater Syria. Palestinian nationalism later internationalized and attached itself to other ideologies, in particular Third World socialism and Islamism, and was embodied in particular by the broadly secular Palestinian Liberation Organisation, and later also by the socialist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Islamist Hamas.\nAlthough the left was initially mostly supportive of Zionism, Soviet anti-Zionism was influential in spreading anti-Zionism on the global left, and much of the New Left of the 1960s took on anti-Zionism as a key tenet.\nToday, opponents include Palestinian nationalists, several states of the Arab League and in the Muslim world, many on the political left, and some secular Jews (such as Jewish Voice for Peace and IfNotNow in the US), as well as the Satmar and Neturei Karta Jewish sects.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThose war crimes are being committed in the name of my security, and my safety, and my religion. And that really offends me because it\u2019s antithetical to everything I have ever known Judaism to be.\n\u2014 Jewish anti-Zionist Hanna Stolzer\nMany Jewish anti-Zionist groups operate both in Israel and the United States, most notably Jewish Voice for Peace, whose thousands of members opposes Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories. These groups outwardly reject an inherent union between Judaism and Zionism and, as a result, face animosity and marginalization from Zionist Jews in their community.\nThe fascist far-right have also generally espoused anti-Zionism, for antisemitic reasons.\nReasons for opposing Zionism have been varied, and they include: fundamental disagreement that foreign born Jews have rights of resettlement, the perception that land confiscations are unfair; expulsions of Palestinians; violence against Palestinians; and alleged racism and supremacism. Arab states in particular have historically strongly opposed Zionism. The preamble of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, which has been ratified by 53 African countries as of 2014[ [update]], includes an undertaking to eliminate Zionism together with other practices including colonialism, neo-colonialism, apartheid, \"aggressive foreign military bases\" and all forms of discrimination.\nCharacterization as racist.\nIn December 1973, the UN passed a series of resolutions condemning South Africa and included a reference to an \"unholy alliance between Portuguese colonialism, Apartheid and Zionism.\" At the time there was little cooperation between Israel and South Africa, although the two countries developed a close relationship during the late 1970s. Parallels have also been drawn between aspects of South Africa's apartheid regime and certain Israeli policies toward the Palestinians, which are seen as manifestations of racism in Zionist thinking.\nIn 1975 the UN General Assembly passed Resolution 3379, which determined that \"Zionism is a form of racism and racial discrimination\". The resolution quotes from the 1963 Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, \"any doctrine of racial differentiation or superiority is scientifically false, morally condemnable, socially unjust, and dangerous\". The resolution named the occupied territory of Palestine, Zimbabwe, and South Africa as examples of racist regimes. Resolution 3379 was pioneered by the Soviet Union and passed with numerical support from Arab and African states amidst accusations that Israel was supportive of the apartheid regime in South Africa. In 1991 the resolution was repealed with UN General Assembly Resolution 46/86, after Israel declared that it would only participate in the Madrid Conference of 1991 if the resolution were revoked.\nArab countries sought to associate Zionism with racism in connection with a 2001 UN conference on racism in Durban, South Africa, which caused the United States and Israel to walk away from the conference. The final text of the conference did not connect Zionism with racism. A human rights forum arranged in connection with the conference, on the other hand, did equate Zionism with racism and censured Israel for what it called \"racist crimes, including acts of genocide and ethnic cleansing\".\nHaredi Judaism and Zionism.\nHaredi Jews number some 2,100,000 world-wide, constituting 14% of the total Jewish population in the world. Most accept though do not support the secular Israeli state. A small number of Orthodox organizations among these Haredi reject Zionism as they view it as a secular movement and reject nationalism as a doctrine. in Jerusalem, certain Hasidic groups, most famously the Satmar Hasidim, as well as the larger movement they are part of, the Edah HaChareidis, are opposed to its ideology for religious reasons. Despite having his life saved by a leader of the Zionist movement in 1944, one of the best known Hasidic opponents of political Zionism was Hungarian rebbe and Talmudic scholar Joel Teitelbaum. Although this group of ultra-observant Jews do not support or identify with Zionism as a movement or ideology, in a poll taken in February 2024, 83% said they have a \"very strong emotional connection\" to Israel, only a small percentage less than the 87% of Modern Orthodox Jews who reported having those same feelings.\nAnti-Zionism and antisemitism.\nCritics of anti-Zionism have argued that opposition to Zionism can be hard to distinguish from antisemitism, and that criticism of Israel may be used as an excuse to express viewpoints that might otherwise be considered antisemitic.\nAnti-Zionist writers such as Norman Finkelstein, Noam Chomsky, Michael Marder, and Tariq Ali have argued that the characterization of anti-Zionism as antisemitic obscures legitimate criticism of Israel's policies and actions, and that it is used to stifle legitimate criticism of Israel.\nZionism and colonialism.\nEuropean colonialism.\nZionism has been characterized as a form of colonialism or settler colonialism by various scholars. Joseph Massad argues that Zionism was intrinsically linked to European colonial thought from its inception, shaped by antisemitism and European imperial interests. Edward Said similarly described the movement as following the European colonial model, particularly in its patronizing view of the native Palestinian population, which it regarded as backward. Zeev Sternhell describes Zionism as a movement of \"conquest\", but disagrees that Jews arriving in Palestine had a colonial mindset. Anita Shapira and Shlomo Ben-Ami also emphasize the importance of the \"ethos\" of the movement, framing Zionism as a national liberation movement that was \"destined\" or \"forced\" to use colonial methods. Conversely, Nur Masalha argues that Zionism cannot be understood as a national liberation movement because it relied on British colonial support, asserting that \"the State of Israel owes its very existence to the British colonial power in Palestine\".\nVarious proponents of Zionism have characterized Zionism as colonial or settler-colonial. Joseph Massad wrote that, for political and ideological reasons, starting in the 1930s, some Zionist thinkers proposed that the Zionist movement should avoid using terms related to colonialism. Rashid Khalidi describes this move as an attempted rebranding of Zionism as an anticolonial movement.\nBenny Morris dismisses the charge that Zionism is a \"classic nineteenth-century European colonial venture,\" due to the fact that it existed as a movement not to exploit the populace or resources, but to provide a safe haven for a native population experiencing oppression internationally.\nThe transition from British sponsored colonialism to the Israeli state.\nGershon Shafir describes the use of violence by a colonial metropole as essential to settler colonization. Shafir defines settler-colonialism as the creation of a permanent home in which settlers benefit from privileges withheld from the indigenous population. He describes colonization, the establishment of settlements against the wishes of the indigenous people, as the distinctive characteristic of settler colonialism.\nShafir distinguishes between the pre-1948 era and the post-1967 era in the sense that after 1967, the Israeli state became the sponsor of the Zionist movement's colonial efforts, a role that had previously been played by the British. For Shafir, Jerome Slater and Shlomo Ben-Ami, after the Israeli conquest of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1967, the Zionist movement more closely resembled other colonial movements. Similarly, Avi Shlaim describes 1967 as a milestone in the development of the \"Zionist colonial project\" rather than as a qualitative shift in its nature. Israeli historian Yitzhak Sternberg cites Sivan, Halamish and Efrat as similarly describing 1967 as a turning point in which Zionism became involved in colonial efforts.\nShafir and Morris both further distinguish between Zionist colonialism during the First Aliyah and following the arrival of the Second Aliyah. Shafir describes the First Aliyah as following the ethnic plantation colony model, exploiting low wage Palestinian workers. Morris describes this relationship:\nThese Jews were not colonists in the usual sense of sons or agents of an imperial mother country, projecting its power beyond the seas and exploiting Third World natural resources. But the settlements of the First Aliyah were still colonial, with white Europeans living amid and employing a mass of relatively impoverished natives.\nColonization and colonialism.\nSternberg argues that it is important to clearly distinguish between colonization and colonialism as concepts. For Shafir and Peled, \"colonization, namely territorial dispossession and the settlement of immigrant populations\", cannot happen without colonialism and \"the means of violence of a colonial metropole\". In contrast, Sternberg considers classical definitions of colonization as broad enough to include cases that did not require the dispossession of the native population.\nTuvia Friling depicts the Zionist movement as operating differently from colonial movements in terms of land acquisition. Specifically, the Zionist movement acquired land in the early years by purchasing it. Sternberg in contrast explains that it was not unique for colonial movements to purchase land as part of land acquisition, pointing to similarities in North American colonialism. Friling argues that in contrast to European colonial projects, the early Zionist leadership was dominated by the labor movement with a socialist ethos. Shafir points to ideological drives in American and Rhodesian settler colonies that developed in service of the colonial project. Similarly, Shafir says, the Zionist labor movement used socialist ideals largely in service of the national movement.\nIn response to the argument that Zionism could not be a colonial project, but should instead be described as a project of immigration, Shafir quotes Lorenzo Veracini's statement that settlers sometimes hide \"behind the persecuted, the migrant, even the refugee... behind his labor and hardship.\" Shafir goes on to characterize Zionism as not unique, in the sense that \"[t]he ruthless ethnic cleanser is commonly hidden behind the peaceful settler who arrived in an 'empty land' to start a new life.\"\nAlan Dowty describes the debate over the relationship between Zionism and colonialism as essentially a discussion of \"semantics\". He defines colonialism as the imposition of control by a \"mother country\" on another people, for economic gain or for the spreading of culture or religion. Dowty argues that Zionism does not fit this definition on the basis that \"there was... no mother country\" and that Zionism did not consider the local population in its plans. Efraim Karsh adopts a similar definition and similarly concludes that Zionism is not colonialism. Dowty elaborates that Zionism did not control the local population since it ultimately failed to remove the native people from Palestine. In his assessment of whether Zionism is colonialism, Penslar works with a broader definition of colonialism than Dowty, which allows for the country sponsoring the colonial enterprise to be different from the country of origin of the settlers.\nZionism as settler colonialism.\nBeyond characterizing it as a colonial movement, Zionism has been more recently described as a form of settler colonialism, with scholarly proponents of this paradigm including Edward Said, Rashid Khalidi, Noam Chomsky, Ilan Pappe, Fayez Sayegh, Maxime Rodinson, George Jabbour, Ibrahim Abu-Lughod, Baha Abu-Laban, Jamil Hilal, Rosemary Sayigh and Nur Masalha.\nThe settler colonial framework on the conflict emerged in the 1960s during the decolonization of Africa and the Middle East, and re-emerged in Israeli academia in the 1990s led by Israeli and Palestinian scholars, who challenged some of Israel's foundational myths. It built on the work of Patrick Wolfe, an influential theorist of settler colonial studies who has defined settler colonialism as an ongoing \"structure, not an event\" aimed at replacing a native population rather than exploiting it.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPrimary sources\nSecondary sources"}

The palace in turn was named after the brambles () that grew there.\nThere are two main forms of \"zarzuela\": Baroque \"zarzuela\" (c.\u20091630\u00a0\u2013 c.\u20091750), the earliest style, and Romantic \"zarzuela\" (c.\u20091850\u00a0\u2013 c.\u20091950). Romantic zarzuelas can be further divided into two main subgenres, \"g\u00e9nero grande\" and \"g\u00e9nero chico\", although other sub-divisions exist.\n\"Zarzuela\" spread to the Spanish dominions, and many Spanish-speaking countries \u2013 notably Cuba \u2013 developed their own traditions. \"Zarzuela\" is also a strong tradition in the Philippines, where it is also referred to in certain languages as . Other regional and linguistic variants in Spain include the Basque \"\" and the Catalan .\nA masque-like musical theatre had existed in Spain since the time of Juan del Encina. The \"zarzuela\" genre was innovative in giving a dramatic function to the musical numbers, which were integrated into the plot of the work. Dances and choruses were incorporated as well as solo and ensemble numbers, all to orchestral accompaniment.\nBaroque \"zarzuela\".\nIn 1657 at the Royal Palace of \"El Prado\", King Philip IV of Spain, Queen Mariana and their court attended the first performance of a new comedy by Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca, with music by Juan Hidalgo de Polanco titled \"El Laurel de Apolo\" (The Laurels of Apollo). \"El Laurel de Apolo\" traditionally symbolises the birth of a new musical genre that had become known as \"La Zarzuela\".\nLike Calder\u00f3n de la Barca's earlier \"El golfo de las sirenas\" (\"The Sirens' Gulf\", 1657), \"El Laurel de Apolo\" mixed mythological verse drama with operatic solos, popular songs and dances. The characters in these early, baroque \"zarzuelas\" were a mixture of gods, mythological creatures and rustic or pastoral comedy characters; Antonio de Literes's popular \"Acis y Galatea\" (1708) is yet another example. Unlike some other operatic forms, there were spoken interludes, often in verse.\nItalian influence.\nIn 18th-century Bourbon Spain, Italian artistic style dominated in the arts, including Italian opera. \"Zarzuela\", though still written to Spanish texts, changed to accommodate the Italian vogue. During the reign of King Charles III, political problems provoked a series of revolts against his Italian ministers; these were echoed in theatrical presentations. The older style \"zarzuela\" fell out of fashion, but popular Spanish tradition continued to manifest itself in shorter works, such as the single-scene \"tonadilla\" (or \"intermezzo\") of which the finest literary exponent was Ram\u00f3n de la Cruz. Musicians such as Antonio Rodr\u00edguez de Hita were proficient in the shorter style of works, though he also wrote a full-scale \"zarzuela\" with de la Cruz entitled \"Las segadoras de Vallecas\" (\"The Reapers of Vallecas\", 1768). Jos\u00e9 Castel was one of several composers to write for the Teatro del Pr\u00edncipe.\n19th century.\nIn the 1850s and 1860s a group of patriotic writers and composers led by Francisco Barbieri and Joaqu\u00edn Gaztambide revived the \"zarzuela\" form, seeing in it a possible release from French and Italian music hegemony. The elements of the work continue to be the same: sung solos and choruses, spiced with spoken scenes, and comedic songs, ensembles and dances. Costume dramas and regional variations abound, and the librettos (though often based on French originals) are rich in Spanish idioms and popular jargon.\nThe \"zarzuelas\" of the day included in their librettos various regionalisms and popular slang, such as that of Madrid \"castizos\". Often, the success of a work was due to one or more songs that the public came to know and love. Despite some modifications the basic structure of the \"zarzuela\" remained the same: dialogue scenes, songs, choruses, and comic scenes generally performed by two actor-singers. The culminating masterpieces from this period were Barbieri's \"Pan y toros\" and Gaztambide's \"El juramento\". Another notable composer from this period was Emilio Arrieta.\nRomantic \"zarzuela\".\nAfter the Glorious Revolution of 1868, the country entered a deep crisis (especially economically), which was reflected in theatre. The public could not afford high-priced theatre tickets for grandiose productions, which led to the rise of the Teatros Variedades (\"variety theatres\") in Madrid, with cheap tickets for one-act plays (sainetes). This \"theatre of an hour\" had great success and \"zarzuela\" composers took to the new formula with alacrity. Single-act \"zarzuelas\" were classified as \"g\u00e9nero chico\" (\"little genre\") whilst the longer \"zarzuelas\" of three acts, lasting up to four hours, were called \"g\u00e9nero grande\" (\"grand genre\"). \"Zarzuela grande\" battled on at the Teatro de la Zarzuela de Madrid, founded by Barbieri and his friends in the 1850s. A newer theatre, the Apolo, opened in 1873. At first it attempted to present the \"g\u00e9nero grande\", but it soon yielded to the taste and economics of the time, and became the \"temple\" of the more populist \"g\u00e9nero chico\" in the late 1870s.\nMusical content from this era ranges from full-scale operatic arias (\"romanzas\") through to popular songs, and dialogue from high poetic drama to lowlife comedy characters. There are also many types of \"zarzuela\" in between the two named genres, with a variety of musical and dramatic flavours.\nMany of the greatest \"zarzuelas\" were written in the 1880s and 1890s. Felipe P\u00e9rez y Gonz\u00e1lez's zarzuela \"La Gran V\u00eda\" (1886) is considered a masterpiece of the g\u00e9nero chico genre of Spanish plays. The form continued to adapt to new theatrical stimuli until well into the 20th century. With the onset of the Spanish Civil War, the form rapidly declined, and the last romantic \"zarzuelas\" to hold the stage were written in the 1950s.\nWhilst Barbieri produced the influential \"zarzuela grande\" \"El barberillo de Lavapi\u00e9s\", the classic exponent of the \"g\u00e9nero chico\" was his pupil Federico Chueca, whose \"La gran v\u00eda\" (composed with Joaqu\u00edn Valverde Dur\u00e1n) was a cult success both in Spain and throughout Europe.\nThe musical heir of Chueca was Jos\u00e9 Serrano, whose short, one act \"g\u00e9nero chico\" \"zarzuelas\" - notably \"La canci\u00f3n del olvido\", \"Alma de dios\" and the much later \"Los claveles\" and \"La dolorosa\" - form a stylistic bridge to the more musically sophisticated \"zarzuelas\" of the 20th century.\nJust as romantic \"zarzuela\" featured popular customs, festivals, and manners of speech, especially those of the poor areas of Madrid, many feature strong social criticism and reflect political polemics of the day.\n20th century.\nFrom about 1900, the term (\"degraded\" or \"low genre\") was coined to describe an emerging form of entertainment allied to the (revue) type of musical comedy: these were musical works similar to the zarzuela but lighter and bolder in their social criticism, with scenes portraying sexual themes and many verbal double entendres. One popular work from the \"g\u00e9nero \u00ednfimo\" years is \"La corte de Fara\u00f3n\" (1910), by Vicente Lle\u00f3, which was based on the French operetta \"Madame Putiphar\".\nIn the second decade of the century, the influences of Viennese operetta and the English followers of Sullivan such as Lionel Monckton made themselves felt, in works such as \"Molinos de viento\" and \"El asombro de Damasco\" (both by Pablo Luna), before the Spanish tradition of great acts was reasserted in Amadeu Vives's \"Do\u00f1a Francisquita\" (1923). The zarzuela continued to flourish in the 1930s, thanks to composers of the stature of Pablo Soroz\u00e1bal \u2013 who reinvigorated it as a vehicle for socio-political comment \u2013 Federico Moreno Torroba, and Francisco Alonso.\nHowever, the Spanish Civil War brought a decline of the genre, and after the Second World War, its extinction as a live genre was almost total. There were no new authors and the compositions are not renovated. There have been no significant new works created since the 1950s; the existing zarzuela repertoire is costly to produce, and many classics have been performed only sporadically in recent years, at least professionally.\nThe genre has again found favour in Spain and elsewhere: younger people, in particular, have been drawn to its lyrical music and theatrical spectacle in the 1940s and 1950s. Spanish radio and television have dedicated time to zarzuela in 1978, not least in a popular series of programs produced by TVE and entitled \"Antolog\u00eda de la zarzuela\" (\"Zarzuela Anthology\"). These were based on lip syncs of the classic recordings of the 1940s and 1950s. Some years earlier, impresario Jos\u00e9 Tamayo worked a theatrical show of the same name which popularized pieces of zarzuela through several national and international tours.\n\"Zarzuela\" in Catalonia.\nWhile the \"zarzuela\" tradition flourished in Madrid and other Spanish cities, Catalonia developed its own \"zarzuela\", with librettos in Catalan. The atmosphere, the plots, and the music were quite different from the model that triumphed in Madrid, as the Catalan \"zarzuela\" was looking to attract a different public, the bourgeois classes. Catalan \"zarzuela\" was turned little by little into what is called, in Catalan, \"teatre l\u00edric catal\u00e0\" (\"Catalan lyric theater\"), with a personality of its own, and with \"modernista\" lyricists and composers such as Enric Granados or Enric Morera.\nIn the final years of the 19th century, as \"modernisme\" emerged, one of the notable \"modernistas\", and one of Felip Pedrell's pupils, Amadeu Vives came onto the Barcelona scene. He contributed to the creation of the Orfe\u00f3 Catal\u00e0 in 1891, along with Llu\u00eds Millet. In spite of a success sustained over many years, his musical ambition took him to Madrid, where \"zarzuela\" had a higher profile. Vives became one of the most important \"zarzuela\" composers, with such masterpieces as \"Do\u00f1a Francisquita\".\n\"Zarzuela\" in Cuba and Mexico.\nIn Cuba the afrocubanismo \"zarzuelas\" of Ernesto Lecuona (\"Mar\u00eda la O\"; \"El cafetal\"), Eliseo Grenet (\"La virgen morena\") and Gonzalo Roig (\"Cecilia Vald\u00e9s\", based on Cirilo Villaverde's classic novel) represent a brief golden age of political and cultural importance. These and other works centred on the plight of the mulata woman and other black underclasses in Cuban society. The outstanding star of many of these productions was Rita Montaner.\nMexico likewise had its own \"zarzuela\" traditions. One example is Carlo Curti's \"La cuarta plana\", starring Esperanza Iris.\n\"Zarzuela\" in the Philippines.\nIn the Philippines, the \"Zarzuela Musical Theatre\" has been widely adapted by Filipinos in their native cultures, notably in urban areas. The theatre was only introduced by the Spanish in 1878, despite being part of the Spanish Empire since the middle of the 16th century. During this time, the plays were performed only by Spanish people. By 1880, majority of the performers and writers were Filipinos, notably Philippine national hero, Jos\u00e9 Rizal, who was fond of the play. Afterwards, local languages, instead of Spanish, were used to perform the complex theatre, with additions from multiple cultures throughout the archipelago. \nWhen the Philippines was colonized by the Americans in the early 20th century, the humor from the \"moro-moro play\" was added into the Philippine zarzuela, while moving away from the traditional Spanish zarzuela. The theatre afterwards was used by Filipinos to express freedom from discrimination and colonial rule, depicting the Filipino people triumphant against the Spanish and Americans by the end of each play. The revolutionary overtones of the play prompted the American colonialists to arrest various performers and writers of the Philippine zarzuela, to the extent of forcefully shutting down entire zarzuela companies in the Philippines. In the 1920s, due to the introduction of the cinema, the zarzuela became widely popular in the rural areas, disabling the Americans from stopping the plays from spreading. The Philippine zarzuela evolved into a kind of comedy of manners distinct to the Filipino taste. In 2011, the performing art was cited by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts as one of the intangible cultural heritage of the Philippines under the performing arts category that the government may nominate in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists. In 2012, through a partnership with UNESCO, the Philippine government established the documents needed for the safeguarding of the Philippine zarzuela. UNESCO has cited the Philippine zarzuela as the national theatre and opera of the Philippines.\nRecorded \"zarzuela\".\nFrom 1950 onwards, \"zarzuela\" prospered in a series of LP recordings from EMI, Hispavox and others, with worldwide distribution. A series produced by the Alhambra company of Madrid, the majority conducted by the leading Spanish conductor Ataulfo Argenta had particular success. Many featured singers soon to become world-famous, such as Teresa Berganza, Alfredo Kraus and Pilar Lorengar; and later, Montserrat Caball\u00e9 and Pl\u00e1cido Domingo. Less known performers such as Ana Mar\u00eda Iriarte, In\u00e9s Ribadeneira, To\u00f1y Rosado, Carlos Mungu\u00eda, Renato Cesari, and others frequently lent their voices to the recordings. The choirs of Orfe\u00f3n Donostiarra and Singers' Choir of Madrid also contributed, rounding out the overall quality of the works. After Argenta's death others such as Indalecio Cisneros and Rafael Fr\u00fchbeck de Burgos continued in his footsteps. There were also recordings made conducted by the composers themselves, such as Pablo Soroz\u00e1bal and Federico Moreno Torroba. Many well-known singers, including Victoria de los \u00c1ngeles, Montserrat Caball\u00e9, Juan Diego Fl\u00f3rez, and Lisette Oropesa have recorded albums of zarzuela songs and arias.\nMany zarzuela productions are now to be seen on DVD and Blu-ray disc. In March 2009, EuroArts released \"Amor, Vida de Mi Vida\", a recording on Blu-ray disc of an August 2007 zarzuela concert by Pl\u00e1cido Domingo and Ana Mar\u00eda Mart\u00ednez, with the Mozarteum Orchestra of Salzburg conducted by Jes\u00fas L\u00f3pez-Cobos. In April 2009, BBC/Opus Arte released a Blu-ray disc of a July 2006 performance of Federico Moreno Torroba's \"Luisa Fernanda\" with Pl\u00e1cido Domingo and Nancy Herrera, recorded at the Teatro Real de Madrid with Jes\u00fas L\u00f3pez-Cobos conducting.\nIn the United States, the Jarvis Conservatory of Napa, California, between 1996 and 2005, mounted several full zarzuela productions, subsequently issued on DVD and online. The series includes \"La dolorosa\"; \"La Gran Via\"; \"Luisa Fernanda\"; \"La verbena de la Paloma\"; \"La Rosa del Azafr\u00e1n\"; \"La revoltosa\"; \"Agua, Azucarillos y Aguardiente\"; \"Do\u00f1a Francisquita\"; \"Gigantes y Cabezudos\"; \"La alegr\u00eda de la huerta\"; \"La chulapona\"; \"Luis Alonso\" (Gim\u00e9nez, 1896); and \"El barberillo de Lavapi\u00e9s\".\nSpanish zarzuelas selection (including zarzuela-style operas).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "34487", "revid": "1719098", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34487", "title": "Zoop", "text": "1995 video game\nZoop is a puzzle video game originally developed by Hookstone and published by Viacom New Media in 1995 for the Sega Genesis, Super Nintendo Entertainment System, MS-DOS, Macintosh, PlayStation, Game Gear, and Game Boy, then in 1996 for the Saturn and Jaguar. \"Zoop\" has similarities to Taito's 1989 arcade video game \"Plotting\" (also known as \"Flipull\"), but \"Zoop\" runs in real-time instead. Players are tasked with eliminating pieces that spawn from one of the sides of the screen before they reach the center of the playfield. By pointing at a piece and shooting it, the player can either swap it with the current player color and thus arrange the same color pieces in a row or column, or match the color.\nA month before release, \"Zoop\" was one of four games played in the preliminary rounds of the Blockbuster World Video Game Championship II competition, a rare instance of an as-yet-unreleased game being used in a video game competition.\nGameplay.\n\"Zoop\" is a real-time puzzle game, like \"Plotting\", where the player controls a triangle in the center of the screen. Every second (or more often in advanced levels), a piece comes in from the side and possibly pushes other pieces forward. Two consecutive pieces will never come in from the same quadrant, and runs of consecutive identical pieces on one row are longer, statistically, than one might expect. If a piece falls into the center square, the game is over.\nIf the player shoots a piece of the same color as their triangle, it will be \"zooped\" (cleared) and points are earned. If the piece behind the target piece is also of the same color, it is also \"zooped\". The same goes for the next piece, and so on. If a piece of a different color from the player's current piece is shot, the player's piece will switch colors with it. This is also what happens when a piece of a different color is encountered after zooping one or more pieces of the same color. When the quota of \"zooped\" pieces is met, the game speeds up, and (before level 10) the background changes. Various special pieces do different things, such as a proximity bomb (shaped like a lightning bolt) that blows up pieces in a 3\u00d73 area centered at the target piece, or a line bomb (often shaped like a gear) that clears a whole target line of pieces.\nTo make gameplay more difficult, the game also employed what was referred to as \"Opti-Challenge\" backgrounds. As the levels progressed, the backgrounds would become increasingly distracting. Early on, this would involve the use of contrasting colors and increasingly intricate color schemes. Background patterns would also become more intricate and would make subtle use of asymmetrical elements. Although the \"Opti-Challenge\" technique of the game was used as a selling point, very little information exists about the technique itself, and no other game on the market has ever claimed to use \"Opti-Challenge\" graphics. The sound effects have a cartoonish tone to match the vivid colors used through the stages, while the music is smooth jazz and \"evolves\" with the game. As the levels get harder, the music becomes more tense, adding to the fast-paced atmosphere of the game.\nDevelopment and release.\nAlong with \"Dracula Unleashed\", \"Zoop\" is one of the few original properties that were released by Viacom New Media, who only published games that are based on existing intellectual properties (including Viacom Media Networks' programming) until their closure in 1997. The title was extensively marketed by Viacom, who wanted the game to replicate the level of success of \"Tetris\", which can be evidenced by its release on many platforms, as well as the game's slogan, \"America's Largest Killer of Time!\".\nThe team at Hookstone stated in an interview with Spanish magazine \"PC Man\u00eda\" that \"Zoop\" spent several years in development and that the concept proved to be difficult to explain to their producers and as such, the team presented a nearly-finished build. The PC was chosen as the lead platform, despite the development team never having done anything for the PC before. According to Aaron Fothergill, one of the programmers for the Atari Jaguar version of \"Zoop\", Electric Spectacle Productions wanted the Jaguar version to have more advanced visuals than the PlayStation version, but Viacom requested the developer to disable the extra graphics to make the PlayStation version more appealing than the Jaguar version. As of 2018, the rights to \"Zoop\" are held by Viacom International.\nBefore it was officially released to the general public, the game was featured and played during the preliminary rounds on the Blockbuster World Video Game Championship II competition. Shortly after its release, the Super NES version was offered as part of a limited \"rent one, get one free\" promotion by Blockbuster.\nPorts.\nThe Genesis and Super NES versions of \"Zoop\" are identical in terms of gameplay, aside from graphical and audio differences between the two. The MS-DOS version of the game has support for various sound cards, and it uses wavetable-like MIDI music. The PlayStation version was released a month after the system was launched and has more advanced visuals. The Game Boy port is the only version across all platforms that features a multiplayer mode. It also received a port to the Atari Jaguar that was developed by Electric Spectacle Productions and published by Atari Corporation on 5 January 1996, with graphics that are more in line with the previously released versions but sporting a more jazz-style soundtrack. It was one of the last releases for the Jaguar. \"Zoop\" was also released for the Sega Saturn in Japan only by Media Quest on 29 November 1996. The Saturn version uses the same enhanced visuals as the PlayStation port.\nReception.\nThe four reviewers of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" criticized the Game Gear version as having poor audio even by Game Gear standards but otherwise were divided about the game. One of them said \"it is more like work than anything else, and it certainly isn't addictive\", two of them said it lacks anything special but is still addictive and enjoyable for players of all skill levels, and the fourth called it \"a must-try\".\nReviewing the SNES version, a critic for \"Next Generation\" found the gameplay to be too complicated, concluding that \"it's not bad really, but the idea isn't that intuitive, and once you get past the learning curve it lacks the addictive quality this kind of game needs.\" \"GamePro\"'s The Axe Grinder similarly said that, while the game is fun and has good graphics and music, it lacks the addictive pull that an action puzzler needs to distinguish itself.\n\"Sega Saturn Magazine\" (previously \"Sega Magazine\") gave the Genesis/Mega Drive version a 62%, saying the game \"has the curious compulsiveness of \"Tetris\" to a degree\", but that it is overshadowed by more complex and graphically impressive games then on the market. Cover Girl of \"GamePro\" was pleased with the music and graphics, particularly the use of eye-tricking background contrasts in the later levels. She found the level select and five difficulty modes broaden the accessibility, but criticized that the game sends the player back to the beginning whenever they lose. She concluded that while falling short of classics like \"Tetris\", \"Zoop\" is an enjoyable enough puzzler to merit a buy.\nReviewing the Jaguar version, \"GamePro\" noted that it made no changes from previous versions of the game. They said of the game itself: \"A classic? No. Addictive? Yes.\" \"Next Generation\" similarly stated that \"while \"Zoop\" is an enjoyable game, it's not exactly the second puzzling. ... Games like \"Tetris\" and \"Bust-a-Move\" have undeniable magic, and while \"Zoop\" has the mechanics of a great puzzle game, it lacks that magic.\" They praised the pace of the action, in that the game demands the player's full attention from the beginning.\n\"GamePro\"'s brief review of the PlayStation version called it \"an uncomplicated puzzle game that's only slightly hampered by squirrelly controls\" and \"a great addiction for puzzle fans.\" A brief review from \"Next Generation\" commented, \"Action puzzle games should be simple but addicting; \"Zoop\" is complicated but kind of compulsive.\" \"IGN\" rated the PlayStation version of the game a 5/10, stating, \"\"Zoop\" has all the makings of a good puzzle game, it just doesn't deliver the goods.\"\n\"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the DOS version an A\u2212 and said it wasn't as addictive but was as much fun as \"Tetris\".\nThe game was awarded \"Best Puzzle Game\" in the 1995 \"Nintendo Power Awards\".\nLegacy.\nThe game was featured in 1995 in series 5 episode 4 of the British TV series \"GamesMaster\".\nIn September 2003, the trademark renewal for \"Zoop\" was cancelled.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is best known for his role in the Xi'an Incident in 1936, in which he arrested Chiang Kai-shek and forced him to form a Second United Front with the Chinese Communist Party against the Japanese.\nIn 1928, Zhang, at the time a general in the Northeastern Army, became the commander of the army and leader of the Fengtian clique upon his father's assassination. A reformer sympathetic to nationalist ideas, he completed the official reunification of China by pledging loyalty to the Nationalist government, and used his powerful base to wield significant influence in the politics of the Nanjing decade. Zhang followed Chiang's policy of nonresistance to the Japanese invasions of Manchuria in 1931 and Rehe in 1933, after which he was forced to resign as head of the Northeastern Army.\nIn 1935, Zhang was again appointed its commander to suppress the Communists, but became disillusioned with Chiang's policy of \"stabilizing China before resisting Japan\", and helped to plan the Xi'an Incident. Following the incident, Chiang had Zhang arrested for insubordination and sentenced to house arrest, first in mainland China and then in Taiwan. Zhang would remain under confinement until 1988, a period of more than 50 years. He died of pneumonia in 2001, at the age of 100 in Honolulu, Hawaii.\nEarly life.\nZhang Xueliang was born in Haicheng, Liaoning province on June 3, 1901. Zhang was educated by private tutors and, unlike his father, the warlord Zhang Zuolin, he felt at ease in the company of westerners.\nZhang graduated from Fengtian Military Academy, was made a colonel in the Fengtian Army, and appointed the commander of his father's bodyguards in 1919. In 1921 he was sent to Japan to observe military maneuvers, where he developed a special interest in aircraft. Later, he developed an air corps for the Fengtian Army, which was widely used in the battles that took place within the Great Wall during the 1920s. In 1922, he was promoted to major general and commanded an army-sized force. Two years later, he was also made commander of the air units.\nLeader of the Northeast.\nChange of Flag.\nUpon the death of his father in 1928, he succeeded him as the leader of the Northeast Peace Preservation Forces (popularly \"Northeastern Army\"), which controlled China's northeastern provinces of Heilongjiang, Fengtian, and Jilin. In December of the same year he proclaimed his allegiance to the Kuomintang (KMT; Chinese Nationalist Party).\nPurge of Yang and Chang.\nYang Yuting, a veteran general of the Fengtian clique, and Governor of Heilongjiang Province Chang Yinhuai, were dissatisfied with Zhang Xueliang inheriting the military and political power of the Three Northeastern Provinces. They believed that the young warlord indulged in drinking, women, and opium, lacking real talent and learning. His military achievements before the age of 24 were in fact the work of his deputy, Guo Songling. After the assassination of Zhang Zuolin, although Zhang Xueliang knew the Japanese were behind it, the 27-year-old Young Marshal was powerless to respond. Instead, he leaned toward cooperating with his former enemies and suppressed veteran contributors to the Fengtian clique.\nYang Yuting, considering himself a senior statesman, often spoke bluntly to Zhang and arrogantly flaunted his seniority, frequently ridiculing him\u2014acts seen by many generals as disrespectful. Yang also pressured Zhang Xueliang into establishing the \"Northeast Railway Supervisory Office\" and appointed Chang Yinhuai to lead it.\nOn January 10, 1929, Yang Yuting and Chang Yinhuai were lured and executed by Zhang Xueliang. After their execution, Zhang publicly listed their crimes, but simultaneously gave each of their families a condolence payment of 10,000 silver dollars, reflecting the factional struggles within the Fengtian clique. This move shocked the entire Northeast Army. Although the generals professed absolute loyalty, the rift had been formed. To consolidate his authority and prove his capability, Zhang Xueliang sought a decisive victory to win the hearts of his troops.\nRelationship with Japanese.\nThe Japanese believed that Zhang Xueliang, who was known as a womanizer and an opium addict, would be much more subject to Japanese influence than was his father. On this premise, an officer of the Japanese Kwantung Army therefore killed his father, Zhang Zuolin, by exploding a bomb above his train while it crossed under a railroad bridge. Surprisingly, the younger Zhang proved to be more independent and skilled than anyone had expected and declared his support for Chiang Kai-shek, leading to the reunification of China in 1928. With the assistance of Australian journalist William Henry Donald and Dr. Harry Willis Miller, he overcame his opium addiction in 1933 with the administering of Cantharidin auto-serum therapy.\nHe was given the nickname \"Hero of History\" () by PRC historians because of his desire to reunite China and rid it of Japanese invaders; and was willing to pay the price and become \"vice\" leader of China (not because it was good that he was supporting the Kuomintang). In order to rid his command of Japanese influence, he had two prominent pro-Tokyo officials executed in front of the assembled guests at a dinner party in January 1929. In May 1929, relations between the Kuomintang Nanjing and the excessively strengthened Feng Yuxiang worsened. In addition, the Japanese government, dissatisfied with the pro-Kuomintang policy of Zhang Zuolin, and now his son, threatened to \"take the most decisive measures to ensure that the Kuomintang flag never flies over Manchuria\". The \"Young Marshal\" supported Nanjing, and Feng's troops were pushed back to the outlying provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan, and in July 1929, Japan officially recognized Kuomintang China.\nOutside and inside conflicts.\nAt the same time, Zhang Xueliang and Chiang Kai-shek held a personal meeting in Beiping, at which a decision was made on the armed seizure of the Chinese Eastern Railway or CER. By pushing Zhang Xueliang to take this step, Chiang Kai-shek sought to make the Young Marshal completely dependent on Nanjing and at the same time raise his prestige and get most of the profits from the operation of the CER at the disposal of Nanjing. Zhang Xueliang, in turn, believed that the capture of the CER would strengthen his position in the Northeast, allow him to personally manage the profits of the CER, and ensure his independence from Nanjing. As a result, on July 10, 1929, the Conflict on the CER began. However, the Red Army showed a higher combat capability, and the conflict ended with the signing of the Khabarovsk Protocol of December 22, 1929.\nIn 1930, when warlords Feng Yuxiang and Yan Xishan attempted to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang government, Zhang stepped in to support the Nanjing-based government against the Northern warlords in exchange for control of the key railroads in Hebei and the customs revenues from the port city of Tianjin.\nMukden Incident.\nA year later, in the September 18 Mukden Incident, Japanese troops attacked Zhang's forces in Shenyang in order to provoke a full-on war with China, which Chiang did not want to face until his forces were stronger. In accordance with this strategy, Zhang's armies withdrew from the front lines without significant engagements, leading to the effective Japanese occupation of Zhang's former northeastern domain. There has been speculation that Chiang Kai-Shek wrote a letter to Zhang asking him to pull his forces back, but Zhang later stated that he himself issued the orders. Apparently, Zhang was aware of how weak his forces were compared to the Japanese and wished to preserve his position by retaining a sizeable army. Nonetheless, this would still be in line with Chiang's overall strategic standings. At the time of the Mukden Incident, it was Zhang Xueliang himself who issued the \"non-resistance order\". Chiang Kai-shek, in fact, did not receive news of the \"incident\" until the evening of September 19, after he had arrived in Nanchang, learning of it around 9\u201310 PM via Shanghai sources. Zhang himself later admitted, \u201cIt was our Northeast Army that chose not to resist.\u201d\n1930s.\nFurther Retreat.\nAfter retreating from Manchuria, Zhang and the Northeastern Army took up defensive positions along the Great Wall in Rehe. During this time, Zhang sponsored China's first participation in the Olympic Games.\nThe Japanese attacked Zhang again in 1933, and after a weak resistance, Zhang was denied reinforcements from the central government and had to retreat further south. He resigned his posts, underwent treatment for his opium addiction, and left for a year-long exile in Europe. When Zhang returned in January 1934, he sought to regain his position in charge of the Northeastern Army. However, this was strongly opposed by both the Japanese and some Nationalist leaders critical of his failure to stop the Japanese advance. Chiang therefore reassigned him to an anti-Communist force in Wuhan, alienating Zhang and the other leaders of the Northeastern Army. Over the next year, Zhang became a more outspoken critic of Chiang's policy of appeasement towards Japan. He continued to pressure Chiang to reappoint him as head of the Northeastern Army, with the hope that he could use the force to fight the Japanese. On October 2, 1935, Chiang granted Zhang's request, but only because he needed the Northeastern Army's support to crush the final Communist base at Yan'an.\nWar with Communists.\nOn January 6, 1934, Zhang Xueliang returned to China aboard the Conte Verde from Italy, disembarking in Hong Kong to visit Hu Hanmin en route. On February 1, Chiang Kai-shek arrived in Hangzhou from Nanjing to handle military affairs in Fujian; on the same day, Zhang also went to Hangzhou to pay respects to Chiang, expressing that he would \"follow all orders from the central government\". On February 7, the Nationalist Government specially appointed Zhang as Deputy Commander of the Bandit Suppression Headquarters for Henan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces. On February 9, Chiang flew from Hangzhou to Nanchang and summoned Zhang before departure to instruct him on anti-Communist operations in Henan, Hubei, and Anhui; upon arrival, Chiang immediately ordered forces in western Jiangxi to pursue and attack the Hunan\u2013Jiangxi Red Army.\nOn March 1, Zhang assumed his post in Hankou as Deputy Commander of anti-Communist operations in Henan and Hubei, and established a field headquarters in Wuchang on March 5. In June, as Chiang was engaged in the Fifth Encirclement Campaign against the Red Army in Jiangxi, Zhang publicly advocated cooperation between the Nationalists and Communists to save the nation. On June 18, Zhang toured the Henan\u2013Hubei border area, arriving in Huangchuan that day. On June 21, he convened a military meeting there to discuss anti-Communist operations, then proceeded to Shangcheng, and to Lihuang and Lu'an in western Anhui. On June 27, he returned to Wuhan.\nOn October 9, Chiang departed Wuhan with Zhang and Liu Zhi to inspect the provinces of Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia. The next day, they reached Zhengzhou and continued to Luoyang, where Chiang presided over the opening ceremony of the Luoyang Military Academy. He Yingqin also arrived from Beiping to meet with Chiang. On October 12, Chiang and Zhang arrived in Xi'an.\nOn March 1, 1935, the Military Commission\u2019s Wuchang Field Headquarters was established, replacing the former Bandit Suppression HQ for Henan, Hubei, and Anhui. Zhang was named Director, with Yang Yongtai as Secretary General and Qian Dajun as Chief of Staff. In April, Chiang ordered Zhang to encircle the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, but the campaign ended in failure, with two reorganized divisions being annihilated. This led Zhang to grow increasingly resentful of Chiang\u2019s commands.\nOn April 2, the Nationalist Government promoted Yan Xishan, Feng Yuxiang, Zhang Xueliang, He Yingqin, Li Zongren, Zhu Peide, Tang Shengzhi, and Chen Jitang to the rank of First-Class General in the National Army. On April 14, Zhang flew from Chongqing to Guizhou to meet Chiang, accompanied by Henan Public Security Director Feng Zhanfei and Ta Kung Pao editor-in-chief Zhang Jiluan. He returned to Hankou on April 17.\nOn September 13, Zhang flew from Hankou to Xi\u2019an to discuss military affairs with Yang Hucheng and Shao Lizi. On September 19, Zhang inspected Tianshui. On September 20, Chiang established the \u201cNorthwest Bandit Suppression Headquarters\u201d in Xi\u2019an, to command forces from Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai provinces in encircling the Red Army in the northwest. Chiang once again pushed Zhang to the front lines, appointing him Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Northwest Bandit Suppression HQ, to act on Chiang\u2019s behalf as overall commander.\nOn September 21, Zhang flew back to Xi\u2019an to coordinate with Yan Xishan\u2019s representative Zhang Weiqing on attacking the Red Army in northern Shaanxi. On September 24, he flew with Yang Hucheng and Deng Baoshan to Lanzhou to discuss anti-Communist defense strategies with Zhu Shaoliang. On October 16, Zhang flew from Xi\u2019an to Wuchang to wind up field HQ affairs, returning to Xi\u2019an on October 19. The Wuchang Field Headquarters was officially closed on October 20. That autumn, the Northeast Army was transferred to the northwest, suffering heavy losses in the anti-Communist campaign.\nXi'an incident.\nOn April 6, 1936, Zhang met with CPC delegate Zhou Enlai to plan the end of the Chinese Civil War. KMT leader Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek at the time took a passive position against Japan and considered the communists to be a greater danger to the Republic of China than the Japanese, and his overall strategy was to annihilate the communists before focusing his efforts on the Japanese. He believed that \"communism was a cancer while the Japanese represented a superficial wound.\" Growing nationalist anger against Japan made this position very unpopular, and led to Zhang's action against Chiang, known as the Xi'an Incident.\nIn December 1936, Zhang and General Yang Hucheng kidnapped Chiang, imprisoning him until he agreed to form a united front with the communists against the Japanese invasion. After two weeks of negotiations, Chiang agreed to unite with the communists and drive the Japanese out of China.\nAfter Chiang negotiated with the Communists, Zhang flew back to Nanjing as a demonstration of good faith.\nLife under house arrest.\nTrial.\nAs soon as Zhang landed in Nanjing, Chiang had him placed under arrest by military police. Zhang wrote Chiang an obsequious letter of apology. Although he never disavowed his role in the Xi'an incident, he admitted that what he had done was a crime, and asked to be punished. He intended the letter to be a private assurance of loyalty to Chiang, but the latter had the letter published so as to discredit Zhang. Li Liejun then presided over a show trial which convicted Zhang of abducting the Generalissimo and attempting to change government policy, sentencing him to ten years in prison. Chiang had him pardoned just a few days later, on January 4, 1937, but with the stipulation that he not be given his civil rights back and that he would remain under protective detention.\nMainland China.\nDuring the first few years of Zhang's imprisonment, he was regularly moved from location to location under the close supervision of Chiang Kai-shek. He was soon joined by his first wife, Yu Fengzhi. The couple began living with the family of one of his wardens, Liu Yiguang. Zhang was allowed access to his bank account, but was (according to custom) expected to pay for most of the expenses related to his detention. In 1940 Yu Fengzhi became sick with breast cancer and was granted permission to seek treatment in the United States. Although they remained affectionate in their letters to one another, the couple would never see each other again. In 1964, Yu agreed to divorce Zhang so that he could marry Edith Chao.\nTaiwan.\nZhang was eventually taken to Taiwan, where he remained under house arrest until Chiang's death in 1975. Much of his time was spent studying Ming dynasty literature and the Manchu language and collecting Chinese fan paintings, calligraphy, and other works of art by illustrious artists (a collection of more than 200 works using his studio's name \"Dingyuanzhai\" () was auctioned with considerable success by Sotheby's on April 10, 1994).\nZhang studied the New Testament. In 1964, he formally married Edith Chao, daughter of a senior official, who left her family in her teens to become his companion and later followed him into exile. His first wife, Yu, said she was so moved by Ms. Chao's devotion that she released her husband from his vows. Zhang and his wife, Edith, became devout Christians who also regularly attended Sunday services at the Methodist chapel in Shilin, a Taipei suburb, with Chiang Kai-shek's family. On March 26, 1988, two months after the death of Chiang Kai-shek's son Chiang Ching-kuo, his freedom was officially restored.\nLater life and death.\nIn 1991, Zhang made his first trip abroad after being released from house arrest, visiting San Francisco to see friends and family who had moved there. Zhang emigrated to Honolulu, Hawaii in 1995. There he lived with his younger brother Chang Hsueh-sen, who was working as a hotelier. He remained there until his death in 2001.\nAlthough never personally a communist, Zhang is regarded by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the People's Republic of China as a patriotic hero for his role in ending the encirclement campaigns and beginning the Second Sino-Japanese War. There were numerous pleas for him to visit mainland China, but Zhang declined, citing his political closeness to the KMT and his frail health. Despite his lack of return, he was named honorary President of Northeastern University (China) in 1993, where he had previously served as President between 1928 and 1936. Zhang was also named honorary chairman of Harbin Institute of Technology in 1993.\nIn June 2000, Edith Chao died at the age of 88. On October 14 of the following year, Zhang died of pneumonia at the age of 100. at Straub Hospital in Honolulu. Representatives from both China and Taiwan attended his funeral in Honolulu, along with Yan Mingfu, the former head of the CCP's United Front Work Department and the son of Zhang's close friend, Yan Baohang.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His name is commonly transliterated Sophonias in Bibles translated from the Vulgate or Septuagint. The name might mean \"Yahweh has hidden/protected,\" or \"Yah lies in wait\". The church father Jerome interpreted the name to mean \"the watchman of the Lord\". \nThe prophet Zephaniah.\nThe best known Biblical figure bearing the name Zephaniah is the son of Cushi, and great-great grandson of King Hezekiah, ninth in the literary order of the Twelve Minor Prophets. He prophesied in the days of Josiah, ruler of the Kingdom of Judah (640\u2013609 BCE), but before Josiah's reform in 621 BCE, and was contemporary with Jeremiah, with whom he had much in common. The unique source containing the minimal knowledge of his personality and rhetorical and literary qualities is the short, three chapter book of the Old Testament which bears his name. The scene of his activity was the city of Jerusalem, which he seems to know well. The existence of two Zephaniahs linked to the book is considered purely hypothetical.\nDate of activity.\nUnder the two preceding kings of Judah, Amon of Judah and Manasseh of Judah, the cult of other deities, especially Baal and Astarte, had developed in Jerusalem, bringing with it elements of alien culture and morals. Josiah, a dedicated reformer, wished to put an end to perceived misuse of the holy places. One of the most zealous champions and advisers of this reform was Zephaniah, and his writing remains one of the most important documents for the understanding of the era of Josiah.\nBoldly predicting the destruction of Judah for the evil committed by its occupants, the prophet spoke against the religious and moral corruption, when, in view of the idolatry which had penetrated even into the sanctuary, he warned that God would \"destroy out of this place the remnant of Baal, and the names of the idolatrous priests\" (Zeph 1:4), and pleaded for a return to the simplicity of their fathers instead of the luxurious foreign clothing which was worn especially in aristocratic circles (1:8).\nThe age of Zephaniah was also a key historical period, because the lands of Western Asia were overrun by foreigners due to the migration of the Scythians in the last decades of the seventh century BC, and because Jerusalem was only a few decades before its downfall in 586 BC. In light of these events, a message of impending judgment is the primary burden of this figure's preaching (1:7).\nThe Book of Zephaniah.\nThe Book of Zephaniah contains the fundamental ideas of the preaching of Zephaniah. The scheme of the book in its present form is as follows:\nIn Christianity.\nHe is commemorated with the other minor prophets in the calendar of saints of the Armenian Apostolic Church on July 31. On the Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar and in the Roman Martyrology, he is commemorated on December 3.\nHis book is an inspiration for the hymn, \"Dies irae\".\nIn Islam.\nIn Islam, Safanyah (Arabic: \u0635\u0641\u0646\u064a) is recognized by some scholars as a prophet sent to Bani-Israel, though he is not mentioned in the Quran and there are no authentic Hadiths about him. His story is known mainly through Isra\u02bciliyyat and historical works like Ibn Kathir's Al-Bidaya wa l-Nihaya. Details about his life, family, and mission remain largely unknown in Islamic sources.\nOther Zephaniahs in the Bible.\nOther individuals named Zephaniah include:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "34494", "revid": "44103504", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34494", "title": "Zheng He", "text": "Chinese mariner and diplomat (1371\u20131433/1435)\nZheng He (also romanized Cheng Ho; 1371\u20131433/1435) was a Chinese eunuch, admiral and diplomat from the early Ming dynasty, who is often regarded as the greatest admiral in Chinese history. Born into a Muslim family as Ma He, he later adopted the surname Zheng conferred onto him by the Yongle Emperor (r.\u20091402\u00a0\u2013\u00a01424).\nBetween 1405 and 1433, Zheng commanded seven treasure voyages across Asia under the commission of the Yongle Emperor and the succeeding Xuande Emperor (r.\u20091425\u00a0\u2013\u00a01435). According to legend, Zheng's largest ships were almost twice as long as any wooden ship ever recorded, and carried hundreds of sailors on four decks.\nA favorite of the Yongle Emperor, whom Zheng assisted in the Jingnan campaign that overthrew the previous Jianwen Emperor in 1402, Zheng He rose to the top of the Ming imperial hierarchy and served as commander of the southern capital Nanjing.\nEarly life and family.\nZheng was born Ma He to a Muslim family of Kunyang, Kunming, Yunnan, then under the rule of the Principality of Liang loyal to the Northern Yuan dynasty. He had an older brother and four sisters. The Liujiagang and Changle inscriptions suggest that devotion to Tianfei, the patron goddess of sailors and seafarers, was the dominant faith to which he adhered, reflecting the goddess's central role to the treasure fleet. John Guy mentions, \"When Zheng He, the Muslim eunuch leader of the great expeditions to the 'Western Ocean' (Indian Ocean) in the early fifteenth century, embarked on his voyages, it was from the Divine Woman that he sought protection, as well as at the tombs of the Muslim saints on Lingshan Hill, above the city of Quanzhou.\"\nZheng He was a great-great-great-grandson of Sayyid Ajjal Shams al-Din Omar, who served in the administration of the Mongol Empire and was the governor of Yunnan during the early Yuan dynasty. His great-grandfather Bayan may have been stationed at a Mongol garrison in Yunnan. Zheng He's grandfather carried the title \"hajji\", and his father had the sinicized surname Ma and the title \"hajji\", which suggests that they had made the pilgrimage to Mecca.\nIn the autumn of 1382, a Ming army invaded and conquered Yunnan, which was then ruled by the Mongol prince Basalawarmi, Prince of Liang. In 1381, Ma Hajji, Zheng He's father, died in the fighting between the Ming armies and Mongol forces. Dreyer states that Zheng He's father died at 39 while resisting the Ming conquest, while Levathes states that Zheng He's father died at 37, but it is unclear if he was helping the Mongol Army or was just caught in the onslaught of battle. Wenming, the oldest son, buried their father outside Kunming. In his capacity as Admiral, Zheng He had an epitaph engraved in honour of his father, composed by the Minister of Rites Li Zhigang on 1 June 1405, which was Duanwu Festival.\nCapture and service.\nZheng He was captured by the Ming armies in Yunnan in 1381. General Fu Youde saw Ma He on a road and approached him to inquire about the location of the Mongol pretender. Ma He responded defiantly by saying that the Mongol pretender had jumped into a lake. Then the general took him prisoner. He was castrated between the ages of 10 and 14, and placed in the service of the Prince of Yan.\nMa He was sent to serve in the household of Zhu Di, the Prince of Yan, who later became the Yongle Emperor. Zhu Di was 11 years older than Ma. Enslaved as a eunuch servant, Ma He eventually gained the confidence of Zhu Di, who, as his benefactor, gained the allegiance and loyalty of the young eunuch. The prince had been governing Beiping (modern Beijing) since 1380. It was near the northern frontier with hostile Mongol tribes. Ma spent his early life as a soldier on the northern frontier and often participated in Zhu Di's military campaigns against the Mongols. On 2 March 1390, Ma accompanied the prince when he commanded his first expedition, which was a great victory, as the Mongol commander Naghachu surrendered as soon as he realized he had fallen into a trap.\nEventually, he gained the confidence and trust of the prince. Ma was also known as \"Sanbao\" during his service in the household of the Prince of Yan, a reference to the Buddhist Three Jewels. Ma received a proper education at Beiping, which he would not have had if he had been placed in the imperial capital of Nanjing as the Hongwu Emperor, the father of Zhu Di, did not trust eunuchs and believed that it was better to keep them illiterate. The Hongwu Emperor purged and exterminated much of the original Ming leadership and gave his enfeoffed sons more military authority, especially those in the north, like the Prince of Yan.\nAdulthood and military career.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe power of the goddess, having indeed been manifested in previous times, has been abundantly revealed in the present generation. In the midst of the rushing waters it happened that, when there was a hurricane, suddenly a divine lantern was seen shining at the masthead, and as soon as that miraculous light appeared the danger was appeased, so that even in the peril of capsizing one felt reassured and that there was no cause for fear.\n\u2014 \"Admiral Zheng He and his associates (Changle inscription) about witnessing Tianfei's divine lantern, which represented the natural phenomenon St. Elmo's fire\"\nZheng He's appearance as an adult was recorded: he was seven \"chi\" tall, had a waist that was five \"chi\" in circumference, cheeks and a forehead that was high, a small nose, glaring eyes, teeth that were white and well-shaped as shells, and a voice that was as loud as a bell. It is also recorded that he had great knowledge about warfare and was well-accustomed to battle.\nThe young eunuch eventually became a trusted adviser to the prince and assisted him when the Jianwen Emperor's hostility to his uncle's feudal bases prompted the 1399\u20131402 Jingnan Campaign, which ended with the emperor's apparent death and the ascension of Zhu Di, Prince of Yan, as the Yongle Emperor. In 1393, the Crown Prince had died, thus the deceased prince's son became the new heir apparent. By the time the emperor died (24 June 1398), the Prince of Qin and the Prince of Jin had perished, which left Zhu Di, the Prince of Yan, as the eldest surviving son of the emperor. However, Zhu Di's nephew succeeded the imperial throne as the Jianwen Emperor. In 1398, he issued a policy known as \"xu\u0113f\u0101n\" (), or \"reducing the feudatories\", which entailed eliminating all princes by stripping their power and military forces. In August 1399, Zhu Di openly rebelled against his nephew. In 1399, Ma He successfully defended Beiping's city reservoir, Zhenglunba, against the imperial armies. In January 1402, Zhu Di began with his military campaign to capture the imperial capital, Nanjing. Zheng He would be one of his commanders during that campaign.\nIn 1402, Zhu Di's armies defeated the imperial forces and marched into Nanjing on 13 July 1402. Zhu Di accepted the elevation to emperor four days later. After ascending the throne as the Yongle Emperor, Zhu Di promoted Ma He as the Grand Director (, \"t\u00e0iji\u0101n\") of the Directorate of Palace Servants (). During the Chinese New Year on 11 February 1404, the Yongle Emperor conferred the surname \"Zheng\" to Ma He, because he had distinguished himself defending the city reservoir against imperial forces in 1399. Another reason was that the eunuch commander also distinguished himself during the 1402 campaign to capture the capital, Nanjing.\nIn the new administration, Zheng He served in the highest posts as Grand Director and later as Chief Envoy () during his sea voyages. Over the next three decades he conducted seven of the voyages on behalf of the emperor, trading and collecting tribute in the western Pacific and Indian Oceans.\nIn 1424, Zheng He traveled to Palembang in Sumatra to confer an official seal and letter of appointment upon Shi Jisun, who was placed in the office of Pacification Commissioner. The \"Taizong Shilu\" 27 February 1424 entry reports that Shi Jisun had sent Qiu Yancheng as envoy to petition the approval of the succession from his father Shi Jinqing, who was the Pacification Commissioner of Palembang, and was given permission from the Yongle Emperor. When Zheng He returned from Palembang, he found that the Yongle Emperor had died during his absence. On 7 September 1424, Zhu Gaozhi had inherited the throne as the Hongxi Emperor after the death of the Yongle Emperor on 12 August 1424.\nOn 7 September 1424, the Hongxi Emperor terminated the undertaking of further treasure voyages. On 24 February 1425, he appointed Zheng He as the defender of Nanjing and ordered him to continue his command over the treasure fleet for the city's defense. On 25 March 1428, the Xuande Emperor ordered Zheng He and others to take over the supervision for the rebuilding and repair of the Great Bao'en Temple at Nanjing. He completed the construction of the temple in 1431.\nOn 15 May 1426, the Xuande Emperor ordered the Directorate of Ceremonial to send a letter to Zheng He to reprimand him for a transgression. Earlier, an official petitioned the emperor to reward workmen who had built temples in Nanjing. The Xuande Emperor responded negatively to the official for charging the costs to the court instead of the monks themselves, but he realised that Zheng He and his associates had instigated the official. According to , the nature of the emperor's words indicated that Zheng He's behaviour in the situation was the last straw, but there is too little information about what had happened earlier. Nevertheless, the Xuande Emperor would eventually come to trust Zheng He.\nIn 1430, the new Xuande Emperor appointed Zheng He to command over a seventh and final expedition into the \"Western Ocean\" (Indian Ocean). In 1431, Zheng He was bestowed with the title \"Sanbao Taijian\" (), using his informal name Sanbao and the title of Grand Director.\nExpeditions.\nThe Yuan dynasty and the expanding Sino-Arab trade during the 14th century had gradually expanded Chinese knowledge of the world since \"universal\" maps previously displaying only China and its surrounding seas began to expand farther and farther southwest, with much more accurate depictions of the extent of Arabia and Africa. Between 1405 and 1433, the Ming government sponsored seven naval expeditions. The Yongle Emperor, disregarding the Hongwu Emperor's expressed wishes, designed them to establish a Chinese presence and impose imperial control over the Indian Ocean trade, impress foreign peoples in the Indian Ocean basin, and extend the empire's tributary system. It has also been inferred from passages in the \"History of Ming\" that the initial voyages were launched as part of the emperor's attempt to capture his escaped predecessor, which would have made the first voyage the \"largest-scale manhunt on water in the history of China.\"\nZheng He was placed as the admiral in control of the huge fleet and armed forces that undertook the expeditions. Wang Jinghong was appointed as second in command. Preparations were thorough and wide-ranging, including the use of so many linguists that a foreign language institute was established at Nanjing. Zheng He's first voyage departed 11 July 1405, from Suzhou and consisted of a fleet of 317 ships holding almost 28,000 crewmen.\nZheng He's fleets visited Brunei, Java, Siam (Thailand), Southeast Asia, India, the Horn of Africa, and Arabia, dispensing and receiving goods along the way. Zheng He presented gifts of gold, silver, porcelain, and silk, and in return, China received such novelties as ostriches, zebras, camels, and ivory from the Swahili Coast. The giraffe that he brought back from Malindi was considered to be a \"qilin\" and taken as proof of the Mandate of Heaven upon the administration. The Daxuexi Alley Mosque in Xi'an has a stele dating to January 1523, inscribed with Zheng He's fourth maritime voyage to Tianfang, Arabian Peninsula.\nWhile Zheng He's fleet was unprecedented, the routes were not. His fleet followed long-established, well-mapped routes of trade between China and the Arabian Peninsula that had been used since at least the Han dynasty. That fact, along with the use of a more-than-abundant number of crew members who were regular military personnel, leads some to speculate that the expeditions may have been geared at least partially at spreading China's power through expansion. During the Three Kingdoms Period, the king of Wu sent a 20-year diplomatic mission led by Zhu Ying and Kang Tai along the coast of Asia, which reached as far as the Eastern Roman Empire. After centuries of disruption, the Song dynasty restored large-scale maritime trade from China in the South Pacific and Indian Oceans and reached as far as the Arabian Peninsula and East Africa. When his fleet first arrived at Malacca, there was already a sizable Chinese community. The \"General Survey of the Ocean Shores\" (, \"Y\u00edngy\u00e1 Sh\u00e8ngl\u01cen\"), composed by the translator Ma Huan in 1416, gives very detailed accounts of his observations of people's customs and lives in the ports that they visited. He referred to the expatriate Chinese as \"Tang\" people ().\nThe fleet included troops, their purpose was to demonstrate the Middle Kingdom's strength.48 However, a contemporary reported that Zheng He \"walked like a tiger\" and did not shrink from violence when he considered it necessary to impress foreign peoples with China's military might. He ruthlessly suppressed pirates, who had long plagued Chinese and Southeast Asian waters. For example, he defeated Chen Zuyi, one of the most feared and respected pirate captains, and returned him to China for execution. He also waged a land war against the Kingdom of Kotte on Ceylon, and he made displays of military force when local officials threatened his fleet in Arabia and East Africa. From his fourth voyage, he brought envoys from 30 states, who traveled to China and paid their respects at the Ming court.\nIn 1424, the Yongle Emperor died. His successor, the Hongxi Emperor (r. 1424\u20131425), stopped the voyages during his short reign. Zheng He made one more voyage during the reign of Hongxi's son, the Xuande Emperor (r. 1426\u20131435) but, the voyages of the Chinese treasure ship fleets then ended. Xuande believed his father's decision to halt the voyages had been meritorious and thus \"there would be no need to make a detailed description of his grandfather's sending Zheng He to the Western Ocean.\" The voyages \"were contrary to the rules stipulated in the Huang Ming Zuxun\" (), the dynastic foundation documents laid down by the Hongwu Emperor:\nSome far-off countries pay their tribute to me at much expense and through great difficulties, all of which are by no means my own wish. Messages should be forwarded to them to reduce their tribute so as to avoid high and unnecessary expenses on both sides.\nThey further violated longstanding Confucian principles. They were only made possible by (and therefore continued to represent) a triumph of the Ming's eunuch faction over the administration's scholar-bureaucrats. Upon Zheng He's death and his faction's fall from power, his successors sought to minimize him in official accounts, along with continuing attempts to destroy all records related to the Jianwen Emperor or the manhunt to find him.\nAlthough unmentioned in the official dynastic histories, Zheng He probably died during the treasure fleet's last voyage. Although he has a tomb in China, it is empty since he was buried at sea.\nZheng He led seven expeditions to the \"Western\" or Indian Ocean. Zheng He brought back to China many trophies and envoys from more than thirty kingdoms, including King Vira Alakeshwara of Ceylon, who came to China as a captive to apologize to the Emperor for offenses against his mission.\nZheng He wrote of his travels:\nWe have traversed more than 100,000 \"li\" of immense water spaces and have beheld in the ocean huge waves like mountains rising in the sky, and we have set eyes on barbarian regions far away hidden in a blue transparency of light vapors, while our sails, loftily unfurled like clouds day and night, continued their course [as rapidly] as a star, traversing those savage waves as if we were treading a public thoroughfare...\nSailing charts.\nZheng He's sailing charts, the Mao Kun map, were published in a book entitled the \"Wubei Zhi\" (\"A Treatise on Armament Technology\") written in 1621 and published in 1628 but traced back to Zheng He's and earlier voyages. It was originally a strip map 20.5\u00a0cm by 560\u00a0cm that could be rolled up, but was divided into 40 pages which vary in scale from 7 miles/inch in the Nanjing area to 215 miles/inch in parts of the African coast.\nInvestigation into folios 19V to 20R of the Mao Kun Map, which cover the Indian Ocean including South India, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, and East Africa, suggests that the map is a composite of four maps, one for Sri Lanka, one for South India, one for the Maldives and one for around 400\u00a0km of the East African coast, no further south than 6 degrees south of the Equator. Each of these maps is positioned at a different orientation to fit with the ocean currents and winds required of a sailing chart, rather than a formal map. The analysis also suggests that Arabic-speaking pilots with a detailed knowledge of the African coast were involved in the cartography.\nThere is little attempt to provide an accurate 2-D representation; instead, the sailing instructions are given using a 24-point compass system with a Chinese symbol for each point, together with a sailing time or distance, which takes account of the local currents and winds. Sometimes depth soundings are also provided. It also shows bays, estuaries, capes and islands, ports and mountains along the coast, important landmarks such as pagodas and temples, and shoal rocks. Of 300 named places outside China, more than 80% can be confidently located. There are also fifty observations of stellar altitude.\nSize of ships.\nAccording to Luo Maodeng's novel \"Sanbao Taijian Xia Xiyang Ji Tongsu Yanyi\" (\"Eunuch Sanbao Western Records Popular Romance\", published 1597), the first expedition had:\nOn the ships were navigators, explorers, sailors, doctors, workers, and soldiers, along with the translator and diarist Gong Zhen. Six more expeditions took place from 1407 to 1433, with fleets thought to be of comparable size.\nMarco Polo and Ibn Battuta both described multi-masted ships carrying 500 to 1,000 passengers in their translated accounts. Niccol\u00f2 de' Conti, a contemporary of Zheng He, was also an eyewitness of ships in Southeast Asia, claiming to have seen five-masted junks weighing about 2,000 \"vegetes\", that is Venetian butt. Christopher Wake estimated a burthen of 1300 tons. The ship of Conti may have been a Burmese or Indonesian jong.\nThe largest ships in the fleet, the Chinese treasure ships described in Chinese chronicles, would have been nearly twice as long as any other wooden ship recorded thereafter until the 20th century, surpassing Admiral Nelson's HMS \"Victory\", long, which was launched in 1765, and the \"Vasa\" of 1627. The first ships to attain long were 19th century steamers with iron hulls. Many scholars consider it unlikely that any of Zheng He's ships were in length and have proposed much shorter lengths, as low as . Zhao Zhigang claimed that he has solved the debate of the size difference, and stated that Zheng He's largest ship was about in length.\nDisputes of historical records of length.\nEdward L. Dreyer claims that Luo Maodeng's novel is unsuitable as historical evidence. The novel contains a number of fantasy element; for example the ships were \"constructed with divine help by the immortal Lu Ban\".\nOne explanation for the seemingly-inefficient size of the colossal ships was that the 44 \"zhang\" treasure ships were used only by the Emperor and imperial bureaucrats to travel along the Yangtze for court business, including reviewing Zheng He's expedition fleet. The Yangtze river, with its calmer waters, may have been navigable by these treasure ships. Zheng He, a court eunuch, would not have had the privilege in rank to command the largest of the ships, seaworthy or not. The main ships of Zheng He's fleet were instead six-masted 2000-liao ships. That would give burthen of 500 tons and a displacement tonnage of about 800 tons.\nTraditional and popular accounts of Zheng He's voyages have described a great fleet of gigantic ships far larger than any other wooden ships in history. The most grandiose claims for Zheng He's 1405 fleet are entirely based on a calculation derived from an account that was written three centuries later and was accepted as fact by one modern writer; rejected by numerous naval experts. There are even some sources that claim some of the treasure ships might have been as long as . The claims that the Chinese treasure ships reached such size is disputed because other 17th century Ming records stated that European East Indiamen and galleons were 30, 40, 50, and 60 \"zhang\" (90, 120, 150, and 180 m) in length.\nIt is also possible that the measure of \"zhang\" (\u4e08) used in the conversions was mistaken. The length of a Dutch ship recorded in the \"History of Ming\" was 30 \"zhang\". If the \"zhang\" is taken to be 3.2 m, the Dutch ship would be 96 m long. Also the Dutch \"Hongyi\" cannon was recorded to be more than 2 \"zhang\" (6.4 m) long. Comparative study by Hu Xiaowei (2018) concluded that 1 \"zhang\" would be equal to 1.5\u20131.6 m, this means the Dutch ship would be 45\u201348 m long and the cannon would be 3\u20133.2 m long. Taking 1.6 m for 1 \"zhang\", Zheng He's 44 \"zhang\" treasure ship would be long and wide, or 22 \"zhang\" long and 9 \"zhang\" wide if the \"zhang\" is taken to be 3.2 m. It is known that the measure unit during the Ming era was not unified: A measurement of East and West Pagoda in Quanzhou resulted in a \"zhang\" unit of 2.5\u20132.56 m. According to Chen Cunren, one \"zhang\" in the Ming Dynasty is only half a \"zhang\" in modern times.\nTreasure Shipyard excavation.\nFrom 2003 to 2004, the Treasure Shipyard was excavated in northwestern Nanjing (the former capital of the Ming Dynasty), near the Yangtze River. Despite the site being referred to as the \"Longjiang Treasure Shipyard\" (\u9f8d\u6c5f\u5bf6\u8239\u5ee0) in the official names, the site is distinct from the actual Longjiang Shipyard, which was located on a different site and produced different types of ships. The Treasure Shipyard, where Zheng He's fleet is believed to have been built in the Ming Dynasty, once consisted of thirteen basins (based on a 1944 map), most of which have now been covered by the construction of buildings in the 20th century. The basins are believed to have been connected to the Yangtze via a series of gates. Three long basins survive, each with wooden structures inside, interpreted to be frames onto which the ships to be built on. The largest basin extends for a length of . While they were long enough to accommodate the largest claimed Zheng He treasure ship, they were not wide enough to fit even a ship half the claimed size. The basin was only wide at most, with only a width showing evidence of structures. They were also not deep enough, being only deep. Other remains of ships in the site indicate that the ships were only slightly larger than the frames that supported them. Moreover, the basin structures were grouped into clusters with large gaps between them, if each cluster was interpreted as a ship framework, then the largest ship would not exceed at most, probably less.\nThe 2003\u20132004 excavation also recovered two complete wooden rudderposts from the Treasure Shipyard, in addition to another recovered in 1957. They are made of teak and measure\naround in length. Zhou Shide (1962) claimed that the first rudderpost recovered was proof of the enormous dimensions of the ships based on his calculations on how big the rudderblade would be. However Church (2010) points out that Zhou was using calculations based on modern steel propeller-driven ships, not wooden ships; as well as the fact that Zhou's hypothetical rudder shape was based on the flat-bottomed \"shachuan\" (\u6c99\u8239) ship type, not the sea-going \"fuchuan\" (\u798f\u8239). The rudderposts cannot be used to infer the actual size of the rudder blades. Church notes that in traditional wooden Chinese ships, rudderposts were necessarily long in order for them to extend from the water level up unto the ship deck, where it was controlled by the tiller. Church compares it with modern wooden junks built in the traditional \"L\u00fcmeimao\" (\"green eyebrow\", \u7da0\u7709\u6bdb) style, which also have rudderposts that are long, but are only in overall length.\nDeath.\nOne theory is that Admiral Zheng He died in 1433, during or shortly after his seventh voyage. Another is that Zheng He continued to serve as the defender of Nanjing, and died in 1435.\nA tomb was built for Zheng He at the southern slope of Cattle Head Hill, Nanjing. The original tomb was a horseshoe-shaped grave. It is a cenotaph believed to contain his clothes and headgear. In 1985, the tomb was rebuilt following a Muslim style.\nLegacy.\nZheng's voyages were long neglected in official Chinese histories but have become well known in China and abroad since the publication of Liang Qichao's \"Biography of Our Homeland's Great Navigator, Zheng He\" in 1904.\nImperial China.\nIn the decades after the last voyage, Imperial officials minimized the importance of Zheng He and his expeditions throughout the many regnal and dynastic histories they compiled. The information in the Yongle and Xuande Emperors' official annals was incomplete and even erroneous, and other official publications omitted them completely. Although some have seen that as a conspiracy seeking to eliminate memories of the voyages, it is likely that the records were dispersed throughout several departments and the expeditions, unauthorized by and in fact counter to the injunctions of the dynastic founder, presented a kind of embarrassment to the dynasty.\nState-sponsored Ming naval efforts declined dramatically after Zheng's voyages. Starting in the early 15th century, China experienced increasing pressure from the surviving Yuan Mongols from the north. The relocation of the capital to Beijing in the north exacerbated this threat dramatically. At considerable expense, China launched annual military expeditions from Beijing to weaken the Mongolians. The expenditures necessary for the land campaigns directly competed with the funds necessary to continue naval expeditions. Further, in 1449, Mongolian cavalry ambushed a land expedition personally led by the Zhengtong Emperor at Tumu Fortress, less than a day's march from the walls of the capital. The Mongolians wiped out the Chinese army and captured the emperor. The battle had two salient effects. Firstly, it demonstrated the clear threat posed by the northern nomads. Secondly, the Mongols caused a political crisis in China when they released the emperor after his half-brother had already ascended and declared the new Jingtai era. Not until 1457 and the restoration of the former emperor would political stability return. Upon his return to power, China abandoned the strategy of annual land expeditions and instead embarked upon a massive and expensive expansion of the Great Wall of China. In that environment, funding for naval expeditions was simply absent.\nHowever, missions from Southeastern Asia continued to arrive for decades. Depending on local conditions, they could reach such frequency that the court found it necessary to restrict them. The \"History of Ming\" records imperial edicts forbade Java, Champa, and Siam from sending their envoys more often than once every three years.\nSoutheast Asia.\nVeneration.\nAmong the Chinese diaspora in Southeast Asia, Zheng He became a figure of folk veneration. Even some of his crew members who happened to stay in some port sometimes did so as well, such as \"Poontaokong\" on Sulu. The temples of the cult, called after either of his names, Cheng Hoon or Sam Po, are peculiar to overseas Chinese except for a single temple in Hongjian originally constructed by a returned Filipino Chinese in the Ming dynasty and rebuilt by another Filipino Chinese after the original was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution.\nMalacca.\nThe oldest and most important Chinese temple in Malacca is the 17th-century Cheng Hoon Teng, dedicated to Guanyin. During Dutch colonial rule, the head of the Cheng Hoon Temple was appointed as chief over the community's Chinese inhabitants.\nFollowing Zheng He's arrival, the sultan and the sultana of Malacca visited China at the head of over 540 of their subjects, bearing ample tribute. Sultan Mansur Shah (r. 1459\u20131477) later dispatched Tun Perpatih Putih as his envoy to China, carrying a letter from the sultan to the Ming emperor. The letter requested the hand of an imperial daughter in marriage. Malay (but not Chinese) annals record that in 1459, a princess named Hang Li Po or Hang Liu was sent from China to marry the sultan. She came with 500 high-ranking young men and a few hundred handmaidens as her entourage. They eventually settled in Bukit Cina. It is believed that a significant number of them married into the local populace, creating the descendants now known as the Peranakan. Owing to this supposed lineage, the Peranakan still use special honorifics: \"Baba\" for the men and \"Nyonya\" for the women.\nIndonesia.\nThe Chinese Indonesian community have established temples dedicated to Zheng He in Jakarta, Cirebon, Surabaya, and Semarang.\nIn 1961, the Indonesian Islamic leader and scholar Hamka credited Zheng He for playing an important role in the development of Islam in Indonesia. The \"Brunei Times\" credits Zheng He with building Chinese Muslim communities in Palembang and along the shores of Java, the Malay Peninsula, and the Philippines. These Muslims allegedly followed the Hanafi school in the Chinese language.\nWest Asia.\nThere is a monument to Zheng He in Salalah, Oman.67\nWestern scholarship.\nIn the 1950s, historians such as John Fairbank and Joseph Needham popularized the idea that after Zheng He's voyages China turned away from the seas due to the \"Haijin\" edict and was isolated from European technological advancements. Modern historians point out that Chinese maritime commerce did not totally stop after Zheng He, that Chinese ships continued to participate in Southeast Asian commerce until the 19th century, and that active Chinese trading with India and East Africa continued long after the time of Zheng. Moreover, revisionist historians such as Jack Goldstone argue that the Zheng He voyages ended for practical reasons that did not reflect the technological level of China. Although the Ming dynasty prohibited shipping with the \"Haijin\" edict, it was a policy of the Hongwu Emperor that long preceded Zheng He and the ban, so obviously disregarded by the Yongle Emperor, was eventually lifted entirely. However, the ban on maritime shipping forced countless numbers of people into smuggling and piracy. Neglect of the imperial navy and Nanjing dockyards after Zheng He's voyages left the coast highly vulnerable to Japanese wokou during the 16th century.\nRichard von Glahn, a UCLA professor of Chinese history, commented that most treatments of Zheng He present him wrongly, \"offer counterfactual arguments,\" and \"emphasize China's missed opportunity\" by focusing on failures, instead of accomplishments. In contrast, Glahn asserts that \"Zheng He reshaped Asia\" because maritime history in the 15th century was essentially the Zheng He story and the effects of his voyages.\nCultural influence.\nDespite the official neglect, the adventures of the fleet captured the imagination of some Chinese with some writing novelisations of the voyages, such as the \"Romance of the Three-Jeweled Eunuch\" in 1597.\nOn his travels, Zheng He built mosques and also spread the worship of Mazu. He apparently never found time for a pilgrimage to Mecca but sent sailors there on his last voyage. He played an important part in developing relations between China and Islamic countries. Zheng He also visited Muslim shrines of Islamic holy men in the Fujian.\nIn modern times, interest in Zheng He has revived substantially. In Vernor Vinge's 1999 science fiction novel \"A Deepness in the Sky\", an interstellar society of commercial traders in human space are named the Qeng Ho, after the admiral. The expeditions featured prominently in Heather Terrell's 2005 novel \"The Map Thief\". For the 600th anniversary of Zheng He's voyages in 2005, China Central Television produced a special television series, \"Zheng He Xia Xiyang\", starring Gallen Lo as Zheng He. He is also mentioned in part of the main storyline of the first-person shooter game Far Cry 3. The Star Trek series \"\" further featured an advanced starship named USS \"Zheng He\". There was even a US Navy boat that was acquired for picket duty during World War II that was named \"Cheng Ho\" by its previous owner.\nCommemoration.\nIn the People's Republic of China, 11 July is Maritime Day (, \"Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 H\u00e1ngh\u01cei R\u00ec\") and is devoted to the memory of Zheng He's first voyage. Initially Kunming Changshui International Airport was to be named Zheng He International Airport.\nIn 2015, Emotion Media Factory dedicated a special multimedia show \"Zheng He is coming\" for amusement park Romon U-Park (Ningbo, China). The show became a finalist of the amusement industry prestigious Brass Rings Awards by IAAPA.\nZheng He is the namesake of the ROCS \"Cheng Ho\" missile frigate in Taiwan.\nThe People's Liberation Army Navy ship \"Zheng He (AX-81)\" is a Chinese training ship named for him. Like her namesake, she serves as a goodwill ambassador for China, becoming the first Chinese Navy ship to visit the United States in 1989 and completing a circumnavigation of the globe in 2012.\nThe sample-return spacecraft \"Tianwen-2\" was originally named \"ZhengHe\". It launched in 2025 with the mission to explore Near-Earth asteroid 2016 HO3.\nNamed after the explorer, the Zheng He Seamount is an underwater mountain in the Arabian Sea. It is located southwest of Socotra island at .\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "34498", "revid": "196446", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34498", "title": "Zombie process", "text": "Process that is not running, but is in the process table\nOn Unix and Unix-like computer operating systems, a zombie process or defunct process is a process that has completed execution (via the codice_1 system call) but still has an entry in the process table: it is a process in the \"terminated state\". This occurs for the child processes, where the entry is still needed to allow the parent process to read its child's exit status: once the exit status is read via the codice_2 system call, the defunct process' entry is removed from the process table and it is said to be \"reaped\". A child process initially becomes defunct, only then being removed from the resource table. Under normal system operation, defunct processes are immediately waited on by their parent and then reaped by the system. Processes that stay defunct for a long time are usually an error and can cause a resource leak. Generally, the only kernel resource they occupy is the process table entry, their process ID. However, defuncts can also hold buffers open, consuming memory. Defunct processes can hold handles to file descriptors, which prevents the space for those files from being available to the filesystem. This effect can be seen by a difference between codice_3 and codice_4. While codice_3 may show a large amount of free disk space, codice_4 will show a full partition. If the defuncts are not cleaned, this can fill the root partition and crash the system.\nThe term \"zombie process\" derives from the common definition of zombie \u2014 an undead person. In the term's metaphor, the child process has \"died\" but has not yet been \"reaped\". Unlike normal processes, the codice_7 command has no effect on a zombie process.\nZombie processes should not be confused with orphan processes, a process that is still executing, but whose parent has died. When the parent dies, the orphaned child process is adopted by codice_8. When orphan processes die, they do not remain as zombie processes; instead, they are codice_2ed on by codice_8.\nOverview.\nWhen a process ends via codice_1, all of the memory and resources associated with it are deallocated so they can be used by other processes. However, the process's entry in the process table remains. The parent can read the child's exit status by executing the codice_2 system call, whereupon the zombie is removed. The codice_2 call may be executed in sequential code, but it is commonly executed in a handler for the SIGCHLD signal, which the parent receives whenever a child has died.\nAfter the zombie is removed, its process identifier (PID) and entry in the process table can then be reused. However, if a parent fails to call codice_2, the zombie will be left in the process table, causing a resource leak. In some situations this may be desirable \u2013 the parent process wishes to continue holding this resource \u2013 for example if the parent creates another child process it ensures that it will not be allocated the same PID. On modern UNIX-like systems (that comply with SUSv3 specification in this respect), the following special case applies: if the parent \"explicitly\" ignores SIGCHLD by setting its handler to codice_15 (rather than simply ignoring the signal by default) or has the codice_16 flag set, all child exit status information will be discarded and no zombie processes will be left.\nZombies can be identified in the output from the Unix codice_17 command by the presence of a \"codice_18\" in the \"STAT\" column. Zombies that exist for more than a short period of time typically indicate a bug in the parent program, or just an uncommon decision to not reap children (see example). If the parent program is no longer running, zombie processes typically indicate a bug in the operating system. As with other resource leaks, the presence of a few zombies is not worrisome in itself, but may indicate a problem that would grow serious under heavier loads. Since there is no memory allocated to zombie processes \u2013 the only system memory usage is for the process table entry itself \u2013 the primary concern with many zombies is not running out of memory, but rather running out of process table entries, concretely process ID numbers. However, zombies can hold open buffers that are associated with file descriptors, and thereby cause memory to be consumed by the zombie. Zombies can also hold a file descriptor to a file that has been deleted. This prevents the file system from recovering the i-nodes for the deleted file. Therefore, the command to show disk usage will not count the deleted files whose space cannot be reused due to the zombie holding the filedescriptor.\nTo remove zombies from a system, the SIGCHLD signal can be sent to the parent manually, using the codice_7 command. If the parent process still refuses to reap the zombie, and if it would be fine to terminate the parent process, the next step can be to remove the parent process. When a process loses its parent, codice_8 becomes its new parent. codice_8 periodically executes the codice_2 system call to reap any zombies with codice_8 as parent.\nExample.\n\"Synchronously\" waiting for the specific child processes in a (specific) order may leave zombies present longer than the above-mentioned \"short period of time\". It is not necessarily a program bug.\nint main(void)\n pid_t pids[10];\n int i;\n for (i = 9; i &gt;= 0; --i) {\n pids[i] = fork();\n if (pids[i] == 0) {\n printf(\"Child%d\\n\", i);\n sleep(i + 1);\n _exit(0);\n for (i = 9; i &gt;= 0; --i) {\n printf(\"parent%d\\n\", i);\n waitpid(pids[i], NULL, 0);\n return 0;\nExplanation.\nIn the first loop, the original (parent) process forks 10 copies of itself. Each of these child processes (detected by the fact that fork() returned zero) prints a message, sleeps, and exits. All of the children are created at essentially the same time (since the parent is doing very little in the loop), so it is somewhat random when each of them gets scheduled for the first time - thus the scrambled order of their messages.\nDuring the loop, an array of child process IDs is built. There is a copy of the pids[] array in all 11 processes, but only in the parent is it complete - the copy in each child will be missing the lower-numbered child PIDs, and have zero for its own PID. (Not that this really matters, as only the parent process actually uses this array.)\nThe second loop executes only in the parent process (because all of the children have exited before this point), and waits for each child to exit. It waits for the child that slept 10 seconds first; all the others have long since exited, so all of the messages (except the first) appear in quick succession. There is no possibility of random ordering here, since it is driven by a loop in a single process. The first parent message actually appeared before any of the children messages - the parent was able to continue into the second loop before any of the child processes were able to start. This again is just the random behavior of the process scheduler - the \"parent9\" message could have appeared anywhere in the sequence prior to \"parent8\".\nChild0 through Child8 spend one or more seconds in this state, between the time they exited and the time the parent did a waitpid() on them. The parent was already waiting on Child9 before it exited, so that one process spent essentially no time as a zombie.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It has also been used in gaming consoles such as the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Wii U, Wii, Xbox One and Xbox 360.\nThe first public version of Zlib, 0.9, was released on 1 May 1995 and was originally intended for use with the libpng image library. It is free software, distributed under the zlib License.\nCapabilities.\nEncapsulation.\nRaw DEFLATE compressed data (RFC 1951) are typically written with a zlib or gzip wrapper encapsulating the data, by adding a header and footer. This provides stream identification and error detection that are not provided by the raw DEFLATE data.\nThe zlib wrapper (RFC 1950) is smaller than the gzip wrapper (RFC 1952), as the latter stores a file name and other file system information.\nAlgorithm.\nAs of \u00a02018[ [update]], zlib only supports one algorithm, called DEFLATE, which uses a combination of a variation of LZ77 (Lempel\u2013Ziv 1977) and Huffman coding. This algorithm provides good compression on a wide variety of data with minimal use of system resources. This is also the algorithm used in the Zip archive format. The header makes allowance for other algorithms, but none are currently implemented.\nResource use.\nzlib provides facilities for control of processor and memory use. A compression level value may be supplied that trades speed for compression. There are also facilities for conserving memory, useful in restricted memory environments, such as some embedded systems.\nStrategy.\nThe compression can be optimized for specific types of data. If one is using the library to always compress specific types of data, then using a specific strategy may improve compression and performance. For example, if the data contain long lengths of repeated bytes, the run-length encoding (RLE) strategy may give good results at a higher speed. For general data, the default strategy is preferred.\nError handling.\nErrors in compressed data may be detected and skipped. Further, if \"full-flush\" points are written to the compressed stream, then corrupt data can be skipped, and the decompression will resynchronize at the next flush point\u2014although no error recovery of the corrupt data is provided. Full-flush points are useful for large data streams on unreliable channels, where some data loss is unimportant, such as in some multimedia applications. However, creating many flush points can affect the speed as well as the amount (ratio) of compression.\nData length.\nThere is no limit to the length of data that can be compressed or decompressed. Repeated calls to the library allow an unlimited number of blocks of data to be handled. Some ancillary code (counters) may suffer from overflow for long data streams, but this does not affect the actual compression or decompression.\nWhen compressing a long (or infinite) data stream, it is advisable to write regular full-flush points.\nApplications.\nToday, zlib is something of a \"de facto\" standard, to the point that zlib and DEFLATE are often used interchangeably in standards documents, with thousands of applications relying on it for compression, either directly or indirectly. These include:\nzlib is also used in many embedded devices, such as the Apple iPhone and Sony PlayStation 3, because the code is portable, liberally licensed, and has a relatively small memory footprint.\nForks.\nA commonly used library built on an old codebase, zlib is also frequently forked by third-parties that claim improvements to this library:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Infocom compiled game code to files containing Z-machine instructions (called story files or Z-code files) and could therefore port its text adventures to a new platform simply by writing a Z-machine implementation for that platform. With the large number of incompatible home computer systems in use at the time, this was an important advantage over using native code or developing a compiler for each system.\nHistory and design.\nNomenclature and conventions.\nThe \"Z\" of Z-machine stands for \"Zork\", Infocom's first adventure game. Infocom used file extensions of .dat (Data) and .zip (ZIP = Z-machine Interpreter Program), but the latter clashed with the widespread use of .zip for PKZIP-compatible archive files starting in the 1990s, after Activision had closed Infocom.\nInfocom produced six versions of the Z-machine. Files using versions 1 and 2 are very rare. Only two version 1 files are known to have been released by Infocom and only two of version 2. Version 3 covers the majority of Infocom's released games. Later versions had more capabilities, culminating in some graphic support in version 6.\nThe modern convention for Z-code files usually have names ending in .z1, .z2, .z3, .z4, .z5, .z6, .z7, or .z8, where the number is the version number of the Z-machine on which the file is intended to be run, as given by the first byte of the story file. As previously noted, the Infocom games used the equivalent of .z1 through .z6; .z7 and .z8 were proposed and adopted after Infocom had shut down.\nBefore Z-machine.\nThe MDL programming language was derived from Lisp at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology by the Dynamic Modeling group of the Laboratory for Computer Science (LCS) in the 1970s; inspired by \"Colossal Cave Adventure\" (1977), members of that group went on to write \"Zork\" in MDL, completing the initial version two weeks later. Like \"Adventure\", \"Zork\" was programmed for the DEC PDP-10; the finished version occupies 1\u00a0MB of MDL code and requires 512\u00a0KB of RAM to run. Because contemporary home computers did not have these resources, considerable effort was needed to port the game. Eventually, the developers split \"Zork\" into two games for personal computers.\nThe compression required to run \"Zork\" from floppy disks with approximately 80\u00a0KB of storage seemed like an insurmountable barrier to Blank. Berez realized that UCSD Pascal used a virtual machine (VM) model to generate executable files that could be readily ported across platforms, and together with Blank, they devised requirements for a lightweight VM optimized for text adventure games, which would retrieve data and execute instructions as needed from storage to compensate for the relatively small RAM sizes in typical microcomputers. The resulting Z-machine used an object tree structure for in-game items, locations, characters, and weapons. For comparison, the Z-machine parser occupies 3\u00a0kB of storage, while the original PDP-10 parser occupies 10\u00a0Kwords (36-bit).\nZIL and ZIP, ZILCH and ZAP.\nTo complement the Z-machine, Infocom developed the high-level computer language Zork Implementation Language (ZIL) by streamlining MDL, and the Z-language Interpreter Program (ZIP), which compiles ZIL into Z-machine instructions in a two-stage process; this made text adventure development platform-independent and enabled porting to different systems simply by writing an appropriate Z-machine interpreter. ZIP consists of a compiler (ZILCH, short for ZIL Compiler Hack) and an assembler (ZAP, the Z-machine Assembler Program).\nZILCH has never been released, although documentation of ZIL still exists, and an open-source replacement \"ZILF\" has been written. After Mediagenic moved Infocom to California in 1989, \"Computer Gaming World\" stated that \"ZIL ... is functionally dead\", and reported rumors of a \"completely new parser that may never be used\".\nGraham Nelson and \"Inform\".\nIn May 1993, Graham Nelson released the first version of his \"Inform\" compiler, which also generates Z-machine story files as its output, even though the Inform source language is quite different from ZIL.\nInform has become popular in the interactive fiction community. A large proportion of interactive fiction is in the form of Z-machine story files. Demand for the ability to create larger game files led Nelson to specify versions 7 and \n8 of the Z-machine, though version 7 is rarely used. Because of the way addresses are handled, a version 3 story file can be up to 128K in length, a version 5 story can be up to 256K in length, and a version 8 story can be up to 512k in length. Though these sizes may seem small by today's computing standards, for text-only adventures, these are large enough for elaborate games.\nDuring the 1990s, Graham Nelson drew up a Z-Machine Standard based on detailed studies of the existing Infocom files. The standard also includes extensions used by his newer versions, as well as links to the \"Blorb\" resource format and the \"Quetzal\" savefile format. In 2006, Nelson expanded Z-machine to the 32-bit Glulx format for Inform 7. The Interactive Fiction Technology Foundation, founded 2016, manages all these standards.\nZIL (Zork Implementation Language).\nThe ZIL is based on MDL from MIT. Here is the definition of Zork I's brass lantern in ZIL, with added comments to illustrate the meaning of each line:\n&lt;OBJECT LANTERN #_Defines the LANTERN object\n (LOC LIVING-ROOM) #_Defines the initial object location\n (SYNONYM LAMP LANTERN LIGHT) #_Defines synonyms that can be used instead of LANTERN\n (ADJECTIVE BRASS) #_Optional adjective to distinguish this lantern from other lanterns\n (DESC \"brass lantern\") #_Short description in inventory list\n (FLAGS TAKEBIT LIGHTBIT) #_What is this object capable of? It can be TAKEN. It provides LIGHT.\n (ACTION LANTERN-F) #_Subroutine which defines special actions with this object\n (FDESC \"A battery-powered lantern is on the trophy case.\") #_Description during first encounter\n (LDESC \"There is a brass lantern (battery-powered) here.\") #_Later description in other locations\n (SIZE 15)&gt; #_Defines weight to limit inventory capacity\nThe equivalent object in MDL is defined as:\n&lt;OBJECT [\"LAMP\" \"LANTE\" \"LIGHT\"]\n [\"BRASS\"]\n \"lamp\"\n &lt;+ ,OVISON ,TAKEBIT ,LIGHTBIT&gt;\n LANTERN\n (ODESC0 \"A battery-powered brass lantern is on the trophy case.\"\n ODESC1 \"There is a brass lantern (battery-powered) here.\"\n OSIZE 15\n OLINT [0 &gt;])&gt;\nA more complex example involving combat, along with its MDL Zork equivalent, is presented in a 2019 blog post by Andrew Plotkin. Notably, the Z-machine has no support for garbage collection and ZIL has no concept of Lisp's list system.\nInterpreters.\nInterpreters for Z-code files are available on a wide variety of platforms. The Inform website lists links to freely available interpreters for 15 desktop operating systems (including 8-bit microcomputers from the 1980s such as the Apple II, TRS-80, and ZX Spectrum, and grouping \"Unix\" and \"Windows\" as one each), 10 mobile operating systems (including Palm OS and the Game Boy), and four interpreter platforms (Emacs, Java, JavaScript, and Scratch). According to Nelson, it is \"possibly the most portable virtual machine ever created\".\nPopular interpreters include Nitfol and Frotz. Nitfol makes use of the Glk API, and supports versions 1 through 8 of the Z-machine, including the version 6 graphical Z-machine. Save files are stored in the standard Quetzal save format. Binary files are available for several different operating systems, including classic Mac OS, Unix-like systems, Windows.\nFrotz was written in C by Stefan Jokisch in 1995 for DOS. Over time it was ported to other platforms, such as Unix-like systems, RISC OS, and iOS. Sound effects and graphics were supported to varying degrees. By 2002, development stalled and the program was picked up by David Griffith. The code base was split between virtual machine and user interface portions in such a way that the virtual machine became independent from any user interface. This allowed more variety in porting Frotz. One of the stranger ports is also one of the simplest: an instant messaging bot is wrapped around a version of Frotz with the minimum I/O functionality creating a bot with which one can play most Z-machine games using an instant messaging client.\nAnother popular client for macOS and other Unix-like systems is Zoom. It supports the same Quetzal save-format, but the packaging of the file-structure is different.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Adding (or subtracting) 0 to any number leaves that number unchanged; in mathematical terminology, 0 is the additive identity of the integers, rational numbers, real numbers, and complex numbers, as well as other algebraic structures. Multiplying any number by 0 results in 0, and consequently dividing by 0 is generally considered to be undefined in arithmetic.\nAs a numerical digit, 0 plays a crucial role in decimal notation: it indicates that the power of ten corresponding to the place containing a 0 does not contribute to the total. For example, \"205\" in decimal means two hundreds, no tens, and five ones. The same principle applies in place-value notations that uses a base other than ten, such as binary and hexadecimal. The modern use of 0 in this manner derives from Indian mathematics that was transmitted to Europe via medieval Islamic mathematicians and popularized by Fibonacci. It was independently used by the Maya.\nCommon names for the number 0 in English include \"zero\", \"nought\", \"naught\" (), and \"nil\". In contexts where at least one adjacent digit distinguishes it from the letter O, the number is sometimes pronounced as \"oh\" or \"o\" (). Informal or slang terms for 0 include \"zilch\" and \"zip\". Historically, \"ought\", \"aught\" (), and \"cipher\" have also been used.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"zero\" came into the English language via French from the Italian , a contraction of the Venetian form of Italian via \"\u1e63afira\" or \"\u1e63ifr\". In pre-Islamic time the word (Arabic ) had the meaning \"empty\". evolved to mean zero when it was used to translate () from India. The earliest known use of \"zero\" as a Loanword in English literature was 1598.\nThe Italian mathematician Fibonacci (c.\u20091170\u00a0\u2013 c.\u20091250), who grew up in North Africa and is credited with introducing the decimal system to Europe, used the term \"zephyrum\". This became in Italian, and was then contracted to in Venetian. The Italian word was already in existence (meaning \"west wind\" from Latin and Greek ) and may have influenced the spelling when transcribing Arabic .\nModern usage.\nDepending on the context, there may be different words used for the number zero, or the concept of zero. For the simple notion of lacking, the words \"nothing\" (although this is not accurate) and \"none\" are often used. The British English words \"nought\" or \"naught\", and \"nil\" are also synonymous.\nIt is often called \"oh\" in the context of reading out a string of digits, such as telephone numbers, street addresses, credit card numbers, military time, or years. For example, the area code 201 may be pronounced \"two oh one\", and the year 1907 is often pronounced \"nineteen oh seven\". The presence of other digits, indicating that the string contains only numbers, avoids confusion with the letter O. For this reason, systems that include strings with both letters and numbers (such as postcodes in the UK) may exclude the use of the letter O.\nSlang words for zero include \"zip\", \"zilch\", \"nada\", and \"scratch\". In the context of sports, \"nil\" is sometimes used, especially in British English. Several sports have specific words for a score of zero, such as \"love\" in tennis \u2013 possibly from French , \"the egg\" \u2013 and \"duck\" in cricket, a shortening of \"duck's egg\". \"Goose egg\" is another general slang term used for zero.\nHistory.\nAncient Near East.\nAncient Egyptian numerals were of base 10. They used hieroglyphs for the digits and were not positional. In one papyrus written around 1770 BC, a scribe recorded daily incomes and expenditures for the pharaoh's court, using the \"nfr\" hieroglyph to indicate cases where the amount of a foodstuff received was exactly equal to the amount disbursed. Egyptologist Alan Gardiner suggested that the \"nfr\" hieroglyph was being used as a symbol for zero. The same symbol was also used to indicate the base level in drawings of tombs and pyramids, and distances were measured relative to the base line as being above or below this line.\nBy the middle of the 2nd millennium BC, Babylonian mathematics had a sophisticated base 60 positional numeral system. The lack of a positional value (or zero) was indicated by a \"space\" between sexagesimal numerals. In a tablet unearthed at Kish (dating to as early as 700 BC), the scribe B\u00eal-b\u00e2n-aplu used three hooks as a placeholder in the same Babylonian system. By 300 BC, a punctuation symbol (two slanted wedges) was repurposed as a placeholder.\nThe Babylonian positional numeral system differed from the later Hindu\u2013Arabic system in that it did not explicitly specify the magnitude of the leading sexagesimal digit, so that for example the lone digit 1 () might represent any of 1, 60, 3600 = 602, etc., similar to the significand of a floating-point number but without an explicit exponent, and so only distinguished implicitly from context. The zero-like placeholder mark was only ever used in between digits, but never alone or at the end of a number.\nPre-Columbian Americas.\nThe Mesoamerican Long Count calendar developed in south-central Mexico and Central America required the use of zero as a placeholder within its vigesimal (base-20) positional numeral system. Many different glyphs, including the partial quatrefoil were used as a zero symbol for these Long Count dates, the earliest of which (on Stela 2 at Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas) has a date of 36\u00a0BC.\nSince the eight earliest Long Count dates appear outside the Maya homeland, it is generally believed that the use of zero in the Americas predated the Maya and was possibly the invention of the Olmecs. Many of the earliest Long Count dates were found within the Olmec heartland, although the Olmec civilization ended by the 4th century BC, several centuries before the earliest known Long Count dates.\nAlthough zero became an integral part of Maya numerals, with a different, empty tortoise-like \"shell shape\" used for many depictions of the \"zero\" numeral, it is assumed not to have influenced Old World numeral systems.\nQuipu, a knotted cord device, used in the Inca Empire and its predecessor societies in the Andean region to record accounting and other digital data, is encoded in a base ten positional system. Zero is represented by the absence of a knot in the appropriate position.\nClassical antiquity.\nThe ancient Greeks had no symbol for zero (\u03bc\u03b7\u03b4\u03ad\u03bd, pronounced \"m\u0113d\u00e9n\"), and did not use a digit placeholder for it. According to mathematician Charles Seife, the ancient Greeks did begin to adopt the Babylonian placeholder zero for their work in astronomy after 500 BC, representing it with the lowercase Greek letter \"\u03cc\" (\"\u03cc\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\": omicron). However, after using the Babylonian placeholder zero for astronomical calculations they would typically convert the numbers back into Greek numerals. Greeks seemed to have a philosophical opposition to using zero as a number. Other scholars give the Greek partial adoption of the Babylonian zero a later date, with neuroscientist Andreas Nieder giving a date of after 400 BC and mathematician Robert Kaplan dating it after the conquests of Alexander.\nGreeks seemed unsure about the status of zero as a number. Some of them asked themselves, \"How can not being be?\", leading to philosophical and, by the medieval period, religious arguments about the nature and existence of zero and the vacuum. The paradoxes of Zeno of Elea depend in large part on the uncertain interpretation of zero.\nBy AD150, Ptolemy, influenced by Hipparchus and the Babylonians, was using a symbol for zero (\u2014\u00b0) in his work on mathematical astronomy called the \"Syntaxis Mathematica\", also known as the \"Almagest\". This Hellenistic zero was perhaps the earliest documented use of a numeral representing zero in the Old World. Ptolemy used it many times in his \"Almagest\" (VI.8) for the magnitude of solar and lunar eclipses. It represented the value of both digits and minutes of immersion at first and last contact. Digits varied continuously from 0 to 12 to 0 as the Moon passed over the Sun (a triangular pulse), where twelve digits was the angular diameter of the Sun. Minutes of immersion was tabulated from 0\u20320\u2033 to 31\u203220\u2033 to 0\u20320\u2033, where 0\u20320\u2033 used the symbol as a placeholder in two positions of his sexagesimal positional numeral system, while the combination meant a zero angle. Minutes of immersion was also a continuous function (a triangular pulse with convex sides), where d was the digit function and 31\u203220\u2033 was the sum of the radii of the Sun's and Moon's discs. Ptolemy's symbol was a placeholder as well as a number used by two continuous mathematical functions, one within another, so it meant zero, not none. Over time, Ptolemy's zero tended to increase in size and lose the overline, sometimes depicted as a large elongated 0-like omicron \"\u039f\" or as omicron with overline \"\u014d\" instead of a dot with overline.\nThe earliest use of zero in the calculation of the Julian Easter occurred before AD311, at the first entry in a table of epacts as preserved in an Ethiopic document for the years 311 to 369, using a Ge\u02bdez word for \"none\" (English translation is \"0\" elsewhere) alongside Ge\u02bdez numerals (based on Greek numerals), which was translated from an equivalent table published by the Church of Alexandria in Medieval Greek. This use was repeated in 525 in an equivalent table, that was translated via the Latin (\"none\") by Dionysius Exiguus, alongside Roman numerals. When division produced zero as a remainder, \"nihil\", meaning \"nothing\", was used. These medieval zeros were used by all future medieval calculators of Easter. The initial \"N\" was used as a zero symbol in a table of Roman numerals by Bede\u2014or his colleagues\u2014around AD725.\nIn most cultures, 0 was identified before the idea of negative things (i.e., quantities less than zero) was accepted.\nChina.\nThe \"S\u016bnz\u012d Su\u00e0nj\u012bng\", of unknown date but estimated to be dated from the 1st to 5th centuries AD, describe how the4th century BC Chinese counting rods system enabled one to perform positional decimal calculations. As noted in the \"Xiahou Yang Suanjing\" (425\u2013468 AD), to multiply or divide a number by 10, 100, 1000, or 10000, all one needs to do, with rods on the counting board, is to move them forwards, or back, by 1, 2, 3, or 4 places. The rods gave the decimal representation of a number, with an empty space denoting zero. A circa 190 AD, manual, the \"Supplementary Notes on the Art of Figures\", by Xu Yue, also outlines the techniques to add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers, containing zero values in a decimal power, on \"counting devices\", that include counting rods, and abacus. Chinese authors had been familiar with the idea of negative numbers, and decimal fractions, by the Han dynasty (2nd century AD), as seen in \"The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art\". Q\u00edn Ji\u01d4sh\u00e1o's 1247 \"Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections\" is the oldest surviving Chinese mathematical text using a round symbol '\u3007' for zero. The origin of this symbol is unknown; it may have been produced by modifying a square symbol. \nZero was not treated as a number at that time, but as a \"vacant position\".\nChinese Epigraphy.\nA variety of Chinese characters have been used, through history, to represent zero: \u7a7a, \u96f6, \u6d1e, \u3007.\nIndia.\nPingala (c.\u20093rd or 2nd century BC), a Sanskrit prosody scholar, used binary sequences, in the form of short and long syllables (the latter equal in length to two short syllables), to identify the possible valid Sanskrit meters, a notation similar to Morse code. Pingala used the Sanskrit word \"\u015b\u016bnya\" explicitly to refer to zero.\nA decimal place value Grapheme for zero was developed in India. \nThe \"Lokavibh\u0101ga\", a Jain text on cosmology surviving in a medieval Sanskrit translation of the Prakrit original, which is internally dated to AD 458 (Saka era 380), uses a decimal place-value system, including a zero. In this text, \"\u015b\u016bnya\" (\"void, empty\") is also used to refer to zero.\nThe \"Aryabhatiya\" (c. 499), states \"sth\u0101n\u0101t sth\u0101na\u1e41 da\u015bagu\u1e47a\u1e41 sy\u0101t\" \"from place to place each is ten times the preceding\".\nRules governing the use of zero appeared in Brahmagupta's \"Brahmasputha Siddhanta\" (7th century), which states the sum of zero with itself as zero, and incorrectly describes division by zero in the following way:\nA positive or negative number when divided by zero is a fraction with the zero as denominator. Zero divided by a negative or positive number is either zero or is expressed as a fraction with zero as numerator and the finite quantity as denominator. Zero divided by zero is zero.\nBh\u0101skara II's, 12th century, \"L\u012bl\u0101vat\u012b\" instead proposed that division by zero results in an infinite quantity,\nA quantity divided by zero becomes a fraction the denominator of which is zero. This fraction is termed an infinite quantity. In this quantity consisting of that which has zero for its divisor, there is no alteration, though many may be inserted or extracted; as no change takes place in the infinite and immutable God when worlds are created or destroyed, though numerous orders of beings are absorbed or put forth.\nEarly Asian Epigraphy.\nThere are numerous copper plate inscriptions, with the same small O in them, some of them possibly dated to the 6th century, but their date or authenticity may be open to doubt.\nA stone tablet found in the ruins of a temple near Sambor on the Mekong, Krati\u00e9 Province, Cambodia, includes the inscription of \"605\" in Khmer numerals (a set of numeral glyphs for the Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system). The number is the year of the inscription in the Saka era, corresponding to a date of AD 683.\nThe first known use of special glyphs for the decimal digits that includes the indubitable appearance of a symbol for the digit zero, a small circle, appears on a stone inscription found at the Chaturbhuj Temple, Gwalior, in India, dated AD 876.\nA symbol for zero, a black dot, is used throughout the Bakhshali manuscript, a practical manual on arithmetic for merchants. The Bodleian Library reported radiocarbon dating results for six folio from the manuscript, indicating that they came from different centuries, but date the manuscript to AD 799 \u2013 1102.\nMiddle Ages.\nTransmission to Islamic culture.\nThe Arabic-language inheritance of science was largely Greek, followed by Hindu influences. In 773, at Al-Mansur's behest, translations were made of many ancient treatises including Greek, Roman, Indian, and others.\nIn AD 813, astronomical tables were prepared by a Persian mathematician, Mu\u1e25ammad ibn M\u016bs\u0101 al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b, using Hindu numerals; and about 825, he published a book synthesizing Greek and Hindu knowledge and also contained his own contribution to mathematics including an explanation of the use of zero. This book was later translated into Latin in the 12th century under the title \"Algoritmi de numero Indorum\". This title means \"al-Khwarizmi on the Numerals of the Indians\". The word \"Algoritmi\" was the translator's Latinization of Al-Khwarizmi's name, and the word \"Algorithm\" or \"Algorism\" started to acquire a meaning of any arithmetic based on decimals.\nMuhammad ibn Ahmad al-Khwarizmi, in 976, stated that if no number appears in the place of tens in a calculation, a little circle should be used \"to keep the rows\". This circle was called \"\u1e63ifr\".\nTransmission to Europe.\nThe Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system (base 10) reached Western Europe in the 11th century, via Al-Andalus, through Spanish Muslims, the Moors, together with knowledge of classical astronomy and instruments like the astrolabe. Gerbert of Aurillac is credited with reintroducing the lost teachings into Catholic Europe. For this reason, the numerals came to be known in Europe as \"Arabic numerals\". The Italian mathematician Fibonacci or Leonardo of Pisa was instrumental in bringing the system into European mathematics in 1202, stating:\nAfter my father's appointment by his homeland as state official in the customs house of Bugia for the Pisan merchants who thronged to it, he took charge; and in view of its future usefulness and convenience, had me in my boyhood come to him and there wanted me to devote myself to and be instructed in the study of calculation for some days. There, following my introduction, as a consequence of marvelous instruction in the art, to the nine digits of the Hindus, the knowledge of the art very much appealed to me before all others, and for it I realized that all its aspects were studied in Egypt, Syria, Greece, Sicily, and Provence, with their varying methods; and at these places thereafter, while on business. I pursued my study in depth and learned the give-and-take of disputation. But all this even, and the algorism, as well as the art of Pythagoras, I considered as almost a mistake in respect to the method of the Hindus []. Therefore, embracing more stringently that method of the Hindus, and taking stricter pains in its study, while adding certain things from my own understanding and inserting also certain things from the niceties of Euclid's geometric art. I have striven to compose this book in its entirety as understandably as I could, dividing it into fifteen chapters. Almost everything which I have introduced I have displayed with exact proof, in order that those further seeking this knowledge, with its pre-eminent method, might be instructed, and further, in order that the Latin people might not be discovered to be without it, as they have been up to now. If I have perchance omitted anything more or less proper or necessary, I beg indulgence, since there is no one who is blameless and utterly provident in all things. The nine Indian figures are: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1. With these nine figures, and with the sign 0... any number may be written.\nFrom the 13th century, manuals on calculation (adding, multiplying, extracting roots, etc.) became common in Europe where they were called after the Persian mathematician al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b. One popular manual was written by Johannes de Sacrobosco in the early 1200s and was one of the earliest scientific books to be printed, in 1488. The practice of calculating on paper using Hindu\u2013Arabic numerals only gradually displaced calculation by abacus and recording with Roman numerals. In the 16th century, Hindu\u2013Arabic numerals became the predominant numerals used in Europe.\nSymbols and representations.\nToday, the numerical digit 0 is usually written as a circle or ellipse. Traditionally, many print typefaces made the capital letter O more rounded than the narrower, elliptical digit 0. Typewriters originally made no distinction in shape between O and 0; some models did not even have a separate key for the digit 0. The distinction came into prominence on modern character displays.\nA slashed zero (formula_1) is often used to distinguish the number from the letter (mostly in computing, navigation and in the military, for example). The digit 0 with a dot in the center seems to have originated as an option on IBM 3270 displays and has continued with some modern computer typefaces such as Andal\u00e9 Mono, and in some airline reservation systems. One variation uses a short vertical bar instead of the dot. Some fonts designed for use with computers made the \"0\" character more squared at the edges, like a rectangle, and the \"O\" character more rounded. A further distinction is made in falsification-hindering typeface as used on German car number plates by slitting open the digit 0 on the upper right side. In some systems either the letter O or the numeral 0, or both, are excluded from use, to avoid confusion.\nMathematics.\nThe concept of zero plays multiple roles in mathematics: as a digit, it is an important part of positional notation for representing numbers, while it also plays an important role as a number in its own right in many algebraic settings.\nAs a digit.\nIn positional number systems (such as the usual decimal notation for representing numbers), the digit 0 plays the role of a placeholder, indicating that certain powers of the base do not contribute. For example, the decimal number 205 is the sum of two hundreds and five ones, with the 0 digit indicating that no tens are added. The digit plays the same role in decimal fractions and in the decimal representation of other real numbers (indicating whether any tenths, hundredths, thousandths, etc., are present) and in bases other than 10 (for example, in binary, where it indicates which powers of 2 are omitted).\nElementary algebra.\nThe number 0 is the smallest nonnegative integer, and the largest nonpositive integer. The natural number following 0 is 1 and no natural number precedes 0. The number 0 may or may not be considered a natural number, but it is an integer, and hence a rational number and a real number. All rational numbers are algebraic numbers, including 0. When the real numbers are extended to form the complex numbers, 0 becomes the origin of the complex plane.\nThe number 0 can be regarded as neither positive nor negative or, alternatively, both positive and negative and is usually displayed as the central number in a number line. Zero is even (that is, a multiple of 2), and is also an integer multiple of any other integer, rational, or real number. It is neither a prime number nor a composite number: it is not prime because prime numbers are greater than 1 by definition, and it is not composite because it cannot be expressed as the product of two smaller natural numbers. (However, the singleton set {0} is a prime ideal in the ring of the integers.)\nThe following are some basic rules for dealing with the number 0. These rules apply for any real or complex number \"x\", unless otherwise stated.\n 0.\nThe expression , which may be obtained in an attempt to determine the limit of an expression of the form as a result of applying the lim operator independently to both operands of the fraction, is a so-called \"indeterminate form\". That does not mean that the limit sought is necessarily undefined; rather, it means that the limit of , if it exists, must be found by another method, such as l'H\u00f4pital's rule.\nThe sum of 0 numbers (the \"empty sum\") is 0, and the product of 0 numbers (the \"empty product\") is 1. The factorial 0! evaluates to 1, as a special case of the empty product.\nOther uses in mathematics.\nThe role of 0 as the smallest counting number can be generalized or extended in various ways. In set theory, 0 is the cardinality of the empty set (notated as \"{ }\", \"formula_2\", or \"\u2205\"): if one does not have any apples, then one has 0 apples. In fact, in certain axiomatic developments of mathematics from set theory, 0 is \"defined\" to be the empty set. When this is done, the empty set is the von Neumann cardinal assignment for a set with no elements, which is the empty set. The cardinality function, applied to the empty set, returns the empty set as a value, thereby assigning it 0 elements.\nAlso in set theory, 0 is the lowest ordinal number, corresponding to the empty set viewed as a well-ordered set. In order theory (and especially its subfield lattice theory), 0 may denote the least element of a lattice or other partially ordered set.\nThe role of 0 as additive identity generalizes beyond elementary algebra. In abstract algebra, 0 is commonly used to denote a zero element, which is the identity element for addition (if defined on the structure under consideration) and an absorbing element for multiplication (if defined). (Such elements may also be called zero elements.) Examples include identity elements of additive groups and vector spaces. Another example is the zero function (or zero map) on a domain D. This is the constant function with 0 as its only possible output value, that is, it is the function f defined by \"f\"(\"x\") \n 0 for all x in D. As a function from the real numbers to the real numbers, the zero function is the only function that is both even and odd.\nThe number 0 is also used in several other ways within various branches of mathematics:\n 0.\nPhysics.\nThe value zero plays a special role for many physical quantities. For some quantities, the zero level is naturally distinguished from all other levels, whereas for others it is more or less arbitrarily chosen. For example, for an absolute temperature (typically measured in kelvins), zero is the lowest possible value. (Negative temperatures can be defined for some physical systems, but negative-temperature systems are not actually colder.) This is in contrast to temperatures on the Celsius scale, for example, where zero is arbitrarily defined to be at the freezing point of water. Measuring sound intensity in decibels or phons, the zero level is arbitrarily set at a reference value\u2014for example, at a value for the threshold of hearing. In physics, the zero-point energy is the lowest possible energy that a quantum mechanical physical system may possess and is the energy of the ground state of the system.\nComputer science.\nModern computers store information in binary, that is, using an \"alphabet\" that contains only two symbols, usually chosen to be \"0\" and \"1\". Binary coding is convenient for digital electronics, where \"0\" and \"1\" can stand for the absence or presence of electrical current in a wire. Computer programmers typically use high-level programming languages that are more intelligible to humans than the binary instructions that are directly executed by the central processing unit. 0 plays various important roles in high-level languages. For example, a Boolean variable stores a value that is either \"true\" or \"false,\" and 0 is often the numerical representation of \"false.\"\n0 also plays a role in array indexing. The most common practice throughout human history has been to start counting at one, and this is the practice in early classic programming languages such as Fortran and COBOL. However, in the late 1950s LISP introduced zero-based numbering for arrays while Algol 58 introduced completely flexible basing for array subscripts (allowing any positive, negative, or zero integer as base for array subscripts), and most subsequent programming languages adopted one or other of these positions. For example, the elements of an array are numbered starting from 0 in C, so that for an array of \"n\" items the sequence of array indices runs from 0 to \"n\"\u22121.\nThere can be confusion between 0- and 1-based indexing; for example, Java's JDBC indexes parameters from 1 although Java itself uses 0-based indexing.\nIn C, a byte containing the value 0 serves to indicate where a string of characters ends. Also, 0 is a standard way to refer to a null pointer in code.\nIn databases, it is possible for a field not to have a value. It is then said to have a null value. For numeric fields it is not the value zero. For text fields this is not blank nor the empty string. The presence of null values leads to three-valued logic. No longer is a condition either \"true\" or \"false\", but it can be \"undetermined\". Any computation including a null value delivers a null result.\nIn mathematics, there is no \"positive zero\" or \"negative zero\" distinct from zero; both \u22120 and +0 represent exactly the same number. However, in some computer hardware signed number representations, zero has two distinct representations, a positive one grouped with the positive numbers and a negative one grouped with the negatives. This kind of dual representation is known as signed zero, with the latter form sometimes called negative zero. These representations include the signed magnitude and ones' complement binary integer representations (but not the two's complement binary form used in most modern computers), and most floating-point number representations (such as IEEE 754 and IBM S/360 floating-point formats).\nAn epoch, in computing terminology, is the date and time associated with a zero timestamp. The Unix epoch begins the midnight before the first of January 1970. The Classic Mac OS epoch and Palm OS epoch begin the midnight before the first of January 1904.\nMany APIs and operating systems that require applications to return an integer value as an exit status typically use zero to indicate success and non-zero values to indicate specific error or warning conditions.\nProgrammers often use a slashed zero to avoid confusion with the letter \"O\".\nOther fields.\nBiology.\nIn comparative zoology and cognitive science, recognition that some animals display awareness of the concept of zero leads to the conclusion that the capability for numerical abstraction arose early in the evolution of species.\nDating systems.\nIn the BC calendar era, the year 1BC is the first year before AD1; there is not a year zero. By contrast, in astronomical year numbering, the year 1BC is numbered 0, the year 2BC is numbered \u22121, and so forth.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistorical studies.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It lies approximately west of Krokowa, north-west of Puck, and north-west of the regional capital Gda\u0144sk. In 2005 the village had a population of 861.\n\u017barnowiec was the location for the first Polish nuclear power plant (\u017barnowiec Nuclear Power Plant), but construction was stopped in 1990 due to protests of the local population and lack of funds. Recently, the construction plans are being reconsidered.\nHistory.\nThe earliest evidence of settlement in the region dates from the 8th century BC: the inhabitants were apparently linked with the Lusatian and East Pomeranian cultures. There was a settlement near the \u017barnowiec lake from the seventh to the tenth century AD. A village known alternately as \"Sarnkow\", \"Sarnowitz\", \"Sarnowicz\" or \"Czarnowicz\" is first mentioned in sources dating from the thirteenth century, when it was inhabited by the Kashubians.\nIn 1215, \u017barnowiec belonged to the Cistercian order based in Oliwa Abbey, which founded a monastery for women there. In the 13th century the local monastery was granted various privileges including ownership of five nearby villages of Kartoszyno, Lubkowo, Odargowo, \u015awiecino, Wierzchucino, what was confirmed by King of Poland Przemys\u0142 II in 1295 in Gda\u0144sk. In 1297 the monastery received special economic and juridical privileges from M\u015bciw\u00f3j II, Duke of Pomerania. It was located within fragmented medieval Poland.\nIn fourteenth century \u017barnowiec, together with all of Pomerelia was annexed from Poland by the Teutonic Order. In 1433, it was raided by a Hussite army. In 1454 the territory was formally re-incorporated into the Kingdom of Poland by King Casimir IV Jagiellon. In 1462, during the subsequent Thirteen Years' War, the Polish army under Piotr Dunin defeated the Teutonic Knights there (see Battle of \u015awiecino, also known as the Battle of \u017barnowiec). After the war \u017barnowiec was confirmed as part of Poland, and administratively was included in the Pomeranian Voivodeship in the province of Royal Prussia in the Greater Poland Province.\nIn 1589 Kuyavian Bishop and royal secretary Hieronim Rozdra\u017cewski granted the monastery to a female order of Benedictines from Che\u0142mno, who founded an abbey there in 1617. In 1772, after the First Partition of Poland, the village was taken over by Prussia. The population was subjected to anti-Polish policies, including Germanisation. In 1810 Prussians prohibited the admission of new nuns to the monastery. In 1833 nuns expelled by the Prussians from Toru\u0144 settled in the abbey, however in 1834 the abbey was liquidated. During a rally in \u017barnowiec in 1911, Prussians arrested a prominent Polish independence activist in Gda\u0144sk Pomerania and local Kashubian activist Antoni Abraham, who was afterwards sentenced to six weeks in prison in Gda\u0144sk for resisting arrest. The village was restored to Poland in 1919, after the country regained independence after World War I. The monastery was refounded in 1946 by a female order of Benedictines, resettled from Vilnius from former eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union in World War II.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is targeted at the clear specification of computer programs and computer-based systems in general.\nHistory.\nIn 1974, Jean-Raymond Abrial published \"Data Semantics\". He used a notation that would later be taught in the University of Grenoble until the end of the 1980s. While at EDF (\u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France), working with Bertrand Meyer, Abrial also worked on developing Z. The Z notation is used in the 1980 book \"M\u00e9thodes de programmation\".\nZ was originally proposed by Abrial in 1977 with the help of Steve Schuman and Bertrand Meyer. It was developed further at the Programming Research Group at Oxford University, where Abrial worked in the early 1980s, having arrived at Oxford in September 1979.\nAbrial has said that Z is so named \"Because it is the ultimate language!\" although the name \"Zermelo\" is also associated with the Z notation through its use of Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory.\nIn 1992, the Z User Group (ZUG) was established to oversee activities concerning the Z notation, especially meetings and conferences.\nUsage and notation.\nZ is based on the standard mathematical notation used in axiomatic set theory, lambda calculus, and first-order predicate logic. All expressions in Z notation are typed, thereby avoiding some of the paradoxes of naive set theory. Z contains a standardized catalogue (called the \"mathematical toolkit\") of commonly used mathematical functions and predicates, defined using Z itself. It is augmented with Z schema boxes, which can be combined using their own operators, based on standard logical operators, and also by including schemas within other schemas. This allows Z specifications to be built up into large specifications in a convenient manner.\nBecause Z notation uses many non-ASCII symbols, the specification includes suggestions for rendering the Z notation symbols in ASCII and in LaTeX. There are also Unicode encodings for all standard Z symbols.\nStandards.\nISO completed a Z standardization effort in 2002. This standard and a technical corrigendum are available from ISO free:\nAward.\nIn 1992, Oxford University Computing Laboratory and IBM were jointly awarded The Queen's Award for Technological Achievement \"for the development of ... the Z notation, and its application in the IBM Customer Information Control System (CICS) product.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Betaines are zwitterions that cannot isomerize to an all-neutral form, such as when the positive charge is located on a quaternary ammonium group. Similarly, a molecule containing a phosphonium group and a carboxylate group cannot isomerize.\nAmino acids.\nTautomerism of amino acids follows this stoichiometry:\nThe ratio of the concentrations of the two species in solution is independent of pH.\nIt has been suggested, on the basis of theoretical analysis, that the zwitterion is stabilized in aqueous solution by hydrogen bonding with solvent water molecules. Analysis of neutron diffraction data for glycine showed that it was in the zwitterionic form in the solid state and confirmed the presence of hydrogen bonds. Theoretical calculations have been used to show that zwitterions may also be present in the gas phase for some cases different from the simple carboxylic acid-to-amine transfer. \nThe p\"K\"a values for deprotonation of the common amino acids span the approximate range . This is also consistent with the zwitterion being the predominant isomer that is present in an aqueous solution. For comparison, the simple carboxylic acid propionic acid () has a p\"K\"a value of 4.88.\nOther compounds.\nSulfamic acid crystallizes in the zwitterion form.\nIn crystals of anthranilic acid there are two molecules in the unit cell. One molecule is in the zwitterion form, the other is not.\nIn the solid state, H4EDTA is a zwitterion with two protons having been transferred from carboxylic acid groups to the nitrogen atoms.\nIn psilocybin, the proton on the dimethyl amino group is labile and may jump to the phosphate group to form a compound which is not a zwitterion.\nTheoretical studies.\nInsight to the equilibrium in solution may be gained from the results of theoretical calculations. For example, pyridoxal phosphate, a form of vitamin B6, in aqueous solution is predicted to have an equilibrium favoring a tautomeric form in which a proton is transferred from the phenolic -OH group to the nitrogen atom.\nBecause tautomers are different compounds, they sometimes have different enough structures that they can be detected independently in their mixture. This allows experimental analysis of the equilibrium.\nBetaines and similar compounds.\nThe compound trimethylglycine, which was isolated from sugar beet, was named as \"betaine\". Later, other compounds were discovered that contain the same structural motif, a quaternary nitrogen atom with a carboxylate group attached to it via a \u2013CH2\u2013 link. At the present time, all compounds whose structure includes this motif are known as betaines. Betaines do not isomerize because the chemical groups attached to the nitrogen atom are not labile. These compounds may be classed as permanent zwitterions, as isomerisation to a molecule with no electrical charges does not occur, or is very slow.\nOther examples of permanent zwitterions include phosphatidylcholines, which also contain a quaternary nitrogen atom, but with a negatively-charged phosphate group in place of a carboxylate group; sulfobetaines, which contain a quaternary nitrogen atom and a negatively charged sulfonate group; and pulmonary surfactants such as dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine. Lauramidopropyl betaine is the major component of cocamidopropyl betaine.\nConjugated zwitterions.\nStrongly polarized conjugated compounds (conjugated zwitterions) are typically very reactive, share diradical character, activate strong bonds and small molecules, and serve as transient intermediates in catalysis. Donor-acceptor entities are of vast use in photochemistry (photoinduced electron transfer), organic electronics, switching and sensing.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The book was once lost in China until the Qing dynasty mathematician Luo Shilin bought a Korean printed edition and republished it in Yangzhou.\n\"Jade Mirror of the Four Unknowns\".\nZhu's second book, \"Jade Mirror of the Four Unknowns\" (1303) was his most important work, advancing Chinese algebra. The first four of the 288 solved problems illustrate his method of the four unknowns. He shows how to convert a problem stated verbally into a system of polynomial equations (up to 14th order), by using up to four unknowns: \u5929 Heaven, \u5730 Earth, \u4eba Man, \u7269 Matter, and then how to reduce the system to a single polynomial equation in one unknown by successive elimination of unknowns.

A zoetrope is a cylindrical variant of the ph\u00e9nakisticope, an apparatus suggested after the stroboscopic discs were introduced in 1833. The definitive version of the zoetrope, with replaceable film picture film strips, was introduced as a toy by Milton Bradley in 1866 and became very successful.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"zoetrope\" was composed from the Greek root words \u03b6\u03c9\u03ae \"zoe\", \"life\" and \u03c4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 \"tropos\", \"turning\" as a translation of \"wheel of life\".\nThe term was coined by inventor William E. Lincoln, of Providence, Rhode Island.\nTechnology.\nThe zoetrope consists of a cylinder with cuts vertically in the sides. On the inner surface of the cylinder is a band with images from a set of sequenced pictures. As the cylinder spins, the user looks through the cuts at the pictures across. The scanning of the slits keeps the pictures from simply blurring together, and the user sees a rapid succession of images, producing the illusion of motion. From the late 19th century, devices working on similar principles have been developed, named analogously as linear zoetropes and 3D zoetropes, with traditional zoetropes referred to as \"cylindrical zoetropes\" if distinction is needed.\nThe zoetrope works on the same principle as its predecessor, the phenakistoscope, but is more convenient and allows the animation to be viewed by several people at the same time. Instead of being radially arrayed on a disc, the sequence of pictures depicting phases of motion is on a paper strip. For viewing, this is placed against the inner surface of the lower part of an open-topped metal drum, the upper part of which is provided with a vertical viewing slit across from each picture. The drum, on a spindle base, is spun. The faster the drum is spun, the smoother the animation appears.\nEarlier rotating devices with images.\nAn earthenware bowl from Iran, over 5000 years old, could be considered a predecessor of the zoetrope. This bowl is decorated in a series of images portraying a goat jumping toward a tree and eating its leaves. Though the images are sequential and seem evenly distributed around the bowl, to have the images appear as an animation the bowl would have to rotate quite fast and steadily while a stroboscopic effect would somehow have to be generated. As such, it remains very uncertain if the artist who created the bowl actually intended to create an animation.\nAccording to a 4th-century Chinese historical text, the 1st-century BC Chinese mechanical engineer and craftsman Ding Huan created a lamp with a circular band with images of birds and animals that moved \"quite naturally\" when the heat of the lamp caused the band to rotate. However, it is unclear whether this really created the illusion of motion or whether the account was an interpretation of the spatial movement of the pictures of animals. Possibly the same device was referred to as \"umbrella lamp\" and mentioned as \"a variety of zoetrope\" which \"may well have originated in China\" by historian of Chinese technology Joseph Needham. It had pictures painted on thin panes of paper or mica on the sides of a light cylindrical canopy bearing vanes at the top. When placed over a lamp it would give an impression of movement of animals or men. Needham mentions several other descriptions of figures moving after the lighting of a candle or lamp, but some of these have a semi-fabulous context or can be compared to heat operated carousel toys. It is possible that all these early Chinese examples were actually the same as, or very similar to, the \"trotting horse lamp\" [\u8d70\u99ac\u71c8] known in China since before 1000 AD. This is a lantern which on the inside has cut-out silhouettes or painted figures attached to a shaft with a paper vane impeller on top, rotated by heated air rising from a lamp. The moving silhouettes are projected on the thin paper sides of the lantern. Some versions added extra motion with jointed heads, feet or hands of figures triggered by a transversely connected iron wire. None of these lamps are known to have featured sequential substitution of images depicting motion and thus don't display animation in the way that the zoetrope does.\nJohn Bate described a simple device in his 1634 book \"The Mysteries of Nature and Art\". It consisted of \"a light Card, with severall images set upon it\", fastened on the four spokes of a wheel, which was turned around by heat inside a glass or horn cylinder, \"\u017fo that you would think the immages to bee living creatures by their motion\". The description seems rather close to a simple four-phase animation device depicted and described in Henry V. Hopwood's 1899 book \"Living Pictures\" (see picture). Hopwood gave no name, date or any additional information for this toy that rotated when blown upon. A similar device inside a small zoetrope drum with four slits, was marketed around 1900 by a Parisian company as \"L'Animateur\" (or \"The Animator\"). However, Bate's device as it is seen in the accompanying illustration seems not to have actually animated the images, but rather to have moved the images around spatially.\nInvention.\nSimon Stampfer (1833).\nSimon Stampfer, one of the inventors of the phenakistiscope animation disc (or \"stroboscopic discs\" as he called them), suggested in July 1833 in a pamphlet that the sequence of images for the stroboscopic animation could alternatively be placed on a cylinder, or a looped strip of paper or canvas stretched around two parallel rollers.\nWilliam Horner (1834).\nAfter taking notice of Joseph Plateau's invention of the ph\u00e9nakisticope (published in London as \"phantasmascope\") British mathematician William George Horner thought up a cylindrical variation and published details about its mathematical principles in January 1834. He called his device the \"D\u00e6daleum\", as a reference to the Greek myth of Daedalus. Horner's revolving drum had viewing slits between the pictures, instead of above as the later zoetrope variations would have. Horner planned to publish the d\u00e6daleum with optician King, Jr in Bristol but it \"met with some impediment probably in the sketching of the figures\".\nExperimental photographic sequence viewers (1850s\u20131860s).\nDuring the next three decades the ph\u00e9nakisticope remained the more common animation device, while relatively few experimental variations followed the idea of Horner's d\u00e6daleum or Stampfer's stroboscopic cylinder. Most of the zoetrope-like devices created between 1833 and 1865 were intended for viewing photographic sequences, often with a stereoscopic effect. These included Johann Nepomuk Czermak's Stereophoroskop, about which he published an article in 1855.\nOn February 27, 1860, Peter Hubert Desvignes received British patent no. 537 for 28 monocular and stereoscopic variations of cylindrical stroboscopic devices. This included a version that used an endless band of pictures running between two spools that was intermittently lit by an electric spark. Desvignes' \"Mimoscope\", received an Honourable Mention \"for ingenuity of construction\" at the 1862 International Exhibition in London. It could \"exhibit drawings, models, single or stereoscopic photographs, so as to animate animal movements, or that of machinery, showing various other illusions\". Desvignes \"employed models, insects and other objects, instead of pictures, with perfect success\". The horizontal slits (like in Czermak's Stereophoroskop) allowed a much improved view, with both eyes, of the opposite pictures.\nWilliam Ensign Lincoln &amp; Milton Bradley's Zoetrope (1865\u20131867).\nWilliam Ensign Lincoln invented the definitive zoetrope in 1865 when he was about 18 years old and a sophomore at Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island. Lincoln's patented version had the viewing slits on a level \"above\" the pictures, which allowed the use of easily replaceable strips of images. It also had an illustrated paper disc on the base, which was not always exploited on the commercially produced versions. On advice of a local bookstore owner, Lincoln sent a model to color lithographers and board game manufacturers Milton Bradley and Co. Some shop owners advertised the zoetrope in American newspapers in December 1866. William E. Lincoln applied for a U.S. patent for his \"Zo\u00ebtrope\" on July 27, 1866 as an assignor to Milton Bradley, and it was granted on April 23, 1867. \nIt was also patented in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland on June 7, 1867 (application March 6, 1867) under no. 629, by Henry Watson Hallett (as a communication to him by Milton Bradley), and in the Second French Empire by Charles William May (filed May 14, 1867).\nOver the years Milton Bradley released at least seven numbered series of twelve zoetrope strips each, as well as a set of twelve strips by Professor Robert Hallowell Richards showing the gradual transformations from one isometric form to another, and one separately available strip showing the progress of the Grecian bend (a woman morphing into a camel). The London Stereoscopic and Photographic Company was licensed as the British publisher and repeated most of the Milton Bradley animations, while adding a set of twelve animations by famous British illustrator George Cruikshank in 1870. French licensee F. Delacour &amp; Bakes produced the \"Zootrope, ou cercle magique\", of which newspaper \"Le Figaro\" ordered 10,000 copies to sell to subscribers at a reduced price.\nJames Clerk Maxwell's improved zoetrope.\nIn 1868 James Clerk Maxwell had an improved zoetrope constructed. Instead of slits it used concave lenses with a focal length equaling the diameter of the cylinder. The virtual image was thus seen in the centre and appeared much more sharp and steady than in the original zoetrope. Maxwell drew several strips that mostly demonstrated subjects relating to physics, like the vibrations of a harp string or Helmholtz's vortex rings threading through each other. An article about the \"Zootrope perfectionn\u00e9\" was published in French scientific magazine \"Le Cosmos\" in 1869, but the device was never marketed. Maxwell's original zoetrope and some strips are kept in the collection of the Cavendish Museum in Cambridge.\nLinear zoetropes.\nA linear zoetrope consists of an opaque linear screen with thin vertical slits in it. Behind each slit is an image, often illuminated. A motion picture is seen by moving past the display.\nLinear zoetropes have several differences compared to cylindrical zoetropes due to their different geometries. Linear zoetropes can have arbitrarily long animations and can cause images to appear wider than their actual sizes.\nSubway zoetropes.\nJapan.\nLinear zoetrope-like advertising was in use in Japan in the early 1990s, for example on the line between the Narita airport and central Tokyo.\nUnited States.\nIn September 1980, independent filmmaker Bill Brand installed a type of linear zoetrope he called the \"Masstransiscope\" in an unused subway platform at the former Myrtle Avenue station on the New York City Subway. It consists of a wall with 228\u00a0slits; behind each slit is a hand-painted panel, and riders of passing trains see a motion picture. After falling into a state of disrepair, the \"Masstransiscope\" was restored in late 2008. Since then, a variety of artists and advertisers have begun to use subway tunnel walls to produce a zoetrope effect when viewed from moving trains.\nJoshua Spodek, as an astrophysics graduate student, conceived of and led the development of a class of linear zoetropes that saw the zoetrope's first commercial success in over a century. A display of his design debuted in September 2001 in the Atlanta subway system tunnel and showed an advertisement to riders moving past. The display is internally lit and nearly long, with an animation lasting around 20\u00a0seconds. His design soon appeared, both commercially and artistically, in subway systems around North America, Asia, and Europe.\nIn April 2006, the Washington Metro installed advertisement zoetropes between the Metro Center and Gallery Place subway stations. A similar advertisement was installed on the PATH train in New Jersey, between the World Trade Center and Exchange Place stations.\nAt around the same time, the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system installed a zoetrope-type advertisement between the Embarcadero and Montgomery stations which could be viewed by commuters traveling in either direction. The BART ads are still visible, though they are changed infrequently: a particular ad may remain up for several months before being replaced.\nThe New York City Subway hosted two digital linear zoetropes through its Arts for Transit program. One, \"Bryant Park in Motion\", was installed in 2010 at the Bryant Park subway station, and was created by Spodek and students at New York University's Tisch School of Arts' Interactive Telecommunications Program. The other, \"Union Square in Motion\", was installed in 2011 by Spodek and students and alumni from Parsons the New School for Design's Art, Media, and Technology program in the Union Square station.\nOther places.\nThe Kyiv Metro (in Kyiv, Ukraine) also featured an advertisement about 2008 for Life mobile telephone carrier in one of its subway tunnels that featured the zoetrope effect. It was quickly taken down.\nIn Mexico City, Mexico, an advertisement for the Honda Civic featuring a zoetrope effect was placed in one of the Line 2 tunnels.\nThe Zurich Airport Skymetro features a linear zoetrope.\n3D zoetropes.\n3D zoetropes apply the same principle to three-dimensional models, as already practiced by Czermak (1855) and Desvignes (1860) in predecessors of the zoetrope. In 1887, \u00c9tienne-Jules Marey used a large zoetrope to animate a series of plaster models based on his chronophotographs of birds in flight. Modern equivalents normally dispense with the slitted drum and instead use a rapidly flashing strobe light to illuminate the models, producing much clearer and sharper distortion-free results. The models are mounted on a rotating base and the light flashes on and off within an extremely small fraction of a second as each successive model passes the same spot. The stroboscopic effect makes each seem to be a single animated object. By allowing the rotation speed to be slightly out of synchronization with the strobe, the animated objects can be made to appear to also move slowly forwards or backwards, according to how much faster or slower each rotation is than the corresponding series of strobe flashes.\nGhibli.\nThe Ghibli Museum in Tokyo, Japan hosts a 3D zoetrope featuring characters from the animated movie \"My Neighbor Totoro.\" The zoetrope is accompanied by an explanatory display, and is part of an exhibit explaining the principles of animation and historical devices.\n\"Toy Story\".\nPixar created a 3D zoetrope inspired by Ghibli's for its touring exhibition, which first showed at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City and features characters from \"Toy Story 2\". Two more 3D Zoetropes were created by Pixar, both featuring 360-degree viewing. One was installed at Disney California Adventure, sister park to Disneyland, but has since been moved to The Walt Disney Studios Lot in Burbank, CA. The other was installed at Hong Kong Disneyland from 2010 until 2017, and is now shown in Disneyland Paris as of late 2019. The original \"Toy Story\" \"Zoetrope\" still travels worldwide and has been shown in 34 national museums and art galleries in 18 countries since 2005.\n\"All Things Fall\".\n\"All Things Fall\" is a 3D printed zoetrope, created by British artist Mat Collishaw. It is inspired by a painting by Ippolito Scarsella of \"The Massacre of Innocents\". The work was presented during the solo exhibition \"Black Mirror\" at Galleria Borghese in Rome. It is made of steel, aluminium, plaster, resin, lit by LED lights and powered by an electric motor. Of his work, Collishaw says: \"The zoetrope literally repeats characters to create an overwhelming orgy of violence that is simultaneously appalling and compelling.\" Each model figure was 3D printed with a fused deposition modeling technique in acrylonitrile butadiene styrene.\nPeter Hudson.\nOver the period 2002\u20132016, Peter Hudson and the makers at Spin Art, LLC, have created multiple interactive 3D stroboscopic zoetrope art installations. This began with \"Sisyphish\" (2002), a human powered zoetrope that used strobe light to animate human figures swimming on a large rotating disk. \"Sisyphish\", sometimes called \"The Playa Swimmers\", was originally unveiled at the arts and culture event, \"Burning Man\", in the Black Rock Desert of Nevada.\nPeter has since created stroboscopic zoetropes from 2004 to present including: \"Deeper\" (2004), \"Homouroboros\" (2007), \"Tantalus\" (2008), and \"Charon\", which toured Europe and the United Kingdom in summer of 2012. The \"Charon\" zoetrope is built to resemble and rotate in the same kinetic fashion as a ferris wheel, stands at 32\u00a0feet high, weighs 8\u00a0tons and features twenty rowing skeleton figures representing the mythological character, Charon, who carries souls of the newly deceased across the river Styx.\nHudson's most recent zoetrope creation is entitled \"Eternal Return\", took two years to build, and was unveiled in 2014 in the Black Rock Desert.\nPeter Hudson's zoetropes are based in San Francisco are exhibited at various festivals and special events in the United States and internationally throughout the year.\nOther examples.\nWick Alexander and Robin Brailsford's 2001 4-piece artwork titled \"Moving Pictures\" consists of 4 sculptural zoetropes at different public locations in Culver City, California.\nGiant Zoetropes.\nAn 1857 textbook on physics mentioned an early cylindrical stroboscopic installation with moving images that was in diameter and had been exhibited in Frankfurt.\nA \"Great Zoetrope; or: Wheel of Life\", in circumference, with \"life-size figures\", was installed in the Concert Hall of the Crystal Palace in London by permission of the London Stereoscopic and Photographic Company. The programme featured at least four animations based on strips in their catalogue. The huge cylinder was turned around by a gas engine and was operative at least from late 1867 to spring 1868.\nIn 2008, Artem Limited, a UK visual effects house, built a 10-meter wide, 10-metric ton zoetrope for Sony, called the BRAVIA-drome, to promote Sony's motion interpolation technology. It features 64 images of the Brazilian footballer Kak\u00e1. This has been declared the largest zoetrope in the world by \"Guinness World Records\".\nIn 2010, the artist Yishay Garbasz created a 3 meter wide zoetrope for the Busan Biennale with images of her naked body one year before to one year after her gender-affirming surgery.\nIn 2014, Brazilian graffiti-street art duo OSGEMEOS made a large piece called \u201cUntitled (Zoetrope)\u201d featuring their characteristic yellow characters, with an accompanying animation of the zoetrope in motion. It is part of the \"OSGEMEOS: Endless Story\" exhibition at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden (2024-2025).\nSuccessors.\n\u00c9mile Reynaud's 1877 praxinoscope was an improvement on the zoetrope that became popular toward the end of the 19th century. It replaced the zoetrope's narrow viewing slits with an inner circle of mirrors that intermittently reflected the images.\nSoon after the zoetrope became popular, the flip book was introduced in 1868. With its simplicity and compactness, along with its more tactile qualities, the flip book has stayed relatively popular. A disadvantage of the flip book can be seen in the fact that the animation stops rather quickly, while the zoetrope can display animation as a continuous loop.\nEadweard Muybridge published his first chronophotography pictures in 1878. These sequential pictures were soon mounted in zoetropes by several people (including Muybridge himself) and were also published as strips for the zoetrope in the 1880s. This paved the way for the development of cinematography. Muybridge's own zoopraxiscope (1879) was an early moving image projector and one of several inventions made before the breakthrough of cinema in 1895.\nIn 1895 Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re were developing the Kinora simultaneously with the cinematograph. While cinema proved to be an enormous success, the Kinora became a popular motion picture viewer for home use.\nFilm, television and video are seen as the prevailing successors of the zoetrope, when regarded as technological steps in the development of motion pictures. In digital media, GIF animation can arguably be seen as the closest contemporary successor of Zoetrope animation, since both usually show looped image sequences.\nIn 2016, an inside-out variation of the zoetrope was invented and patented with the name Silhouette Zoetrope. The device was invented by the researcher Dr. Christine Veras, and it won third place in the Best Illusion of the Year Contest, paying homage to the classical zoetrope but displaying a unique combination of optical illusions.\nA digital successor to the zoetrope was invented in 2023 by Mike Ando. The Andotrope uses smartphones within a slotted cylinder to produce a 360\u00ba viewing angle for digital content.\nContemporary media uses.\nSince the late 20th century, zoetropes have seen occasional use for artwork, entertainment, marketing and other media use, notably as linear zoetropes and 3D zoetropes (see above).\nMaking a zoetrope has also become a relatively common arts and crafts assignment and a means to explain some of the technical and optical principles of film and motion viewing in educational programs.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "34527", "revid": "1305210577", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34527", "title": "Zodiacal light", "text": "Faint solar glow caused by interplanetary dust at sunset and sunrise\nThe zodiacal light (also called false dawn when seen before sunrise) is a faint glow of diffuse sunlight scattered by interplanetary dust. Brighter around the Sun, it appears in a particularly dark night sky to extend from the Sun's direction in a roughly triangular shape along the zodiac, and appears with less intensity and visibility along the whole ecliptic as the zodiacal band. Zodiacal light spans the entire sky and contributes to the natural light of a clear and moonless night sky. A related phenomenon is \"gegenschein\" (or \"counterglow\"), sunlight backscattered from the interplanetary dust, which appears directly opposite to the Sun as a faint but slightly brighter oval glow.\nZodiacal light contributes to the natural light of the sky, though since zodiacal light is very faint, it is often outshone and rendered invisible by moonlight or light pollution.\nThe interplanetary dust in the Solar System forms a thick, pancake-shaped cloud called the zodiacal cloud which straddles the ecliptic plane. The particle sizes range from 10 to 300 micrometres, implying masses from one nanogram to tens of micrograms.\nThe \"Pioneer 10\" and \"Helios\" spacecraft observations in the 1970s revealed zodiacal light to be scattered by the interplanetary dust cloud in the Solar System.\nAnalysis of images of impact debris from the \"Juno\" spacecraft shows that the distribution of the dust extends from Earth's orbit to the 4:1 orbital resonance with Jupiter at , and suggests that the dust is from Mars. However, no other dedicated dust instrumentation on \"Pioneer 10\", \"Pioneer 11\", \"Galileo\", \"Ulysses\", nor \"Cassini\" found an indication that Mars is a significant source of dust besides comets and asteroids.\nViewing.\nIn the mid-latitudes, the zodiacal light is best observed in the western sky in the spring after the evening twilight has completely disappeared, or in the eastern sky in the autumn just before the morning twilight appears. The zodiacal light appears as a column, brighter at the horizon and tilted at the angle of the ecliptic. The light scattered from extremely small dust particles is strongly forward scattering, although the zodiacal light actually extends all the way around the sky, hence it is brightest when observing at a small angle with the Sun. This is why it is most clearly visible near sunrise or sunset when the Sun is blocked, but the dust particles nearest the line of sight to the Sun are not. The dust band that causes the zodiacal light is uniform across the whole ecliptic.\nThe dust further from the ecliptic is almost undetectable except when viewed at a small angle with the Sun. Thus it is possible to see more of the width at small angles toward the Sun, and it appears wider near the horizon, closer to the Sun under the horizon.\nOrigin.\nThe source of the dust has been long debated. Until recently, it was thought that the dust originated from the tails of active comets and from collisions between asteroids in the asteroid belt. Many of our meteor showers have no known active comet parent bodies. Over 85 percent of the dust is attributed to occasional fragmentations of Jupiter-family comets that are nearly dormant. Jupiter-family comets have orbital periods of less than 20 years and are considered dormant when not actively outgassing, but may do so in the future. The first fully dynamical model of the zodiacal cloud demonstrated that only if the dust was released in orbits that approach Jupiter, is it stirred up enough to explain the thickness of the zodiacal dust cloud. The dust in meteoroid streams is much larger, 300 to 10,000 micrometres in diameter, and falls apart into smaller zodiacal dust grains over time.\nThe Poynting\u2013Robertson effect forces the dust into more circular (but still elongated) orbits, while spiralling slowly into the Sun. Hence a continuous source of new particles is needed to maintain the zodiacal cloud. Cometary dust and dust generated by collisions among the asteroids are believed to be mostly responsible for the maintenance of the dust cloud producing the zodiacal light and the gegenschein.\nParticles can be reduced in size by collisions or by space weathering. When ground down to sizes less than 10 micrometres, the grains are removed from the inner Solar System by solar radiation pressure. The dust is then replenished by the infall from comets. Zodiacal dust around nearby stars is called exozodiacal dust; it is a potentially important source of noise in attempts to directly image extrasolar planets. It has been pointed out that this exozodiacal dust, or hot debris disks, can be an indicator of planets, as planets tend to scatter the comets to the inner Solar System.\nIn 2015, new results from the secondary ion dust spectrometer COSIMA on board the \"ESA/Rosetta\" orbiter confirmed that the parent bodies of interplanetary dust are most probably Jupiter-family comets such as comet 67P/Churyumov\u2013Gerasimenko. Data from the Juno mission indicate that the dust close to Earth has a local origin in the inner Solar System, best fitting the planet Mars as a source.\nAppearance.\nZodiacal light is produced by sunlight reflecting off dust particles in the Solar System known as cosmic dust. Consequently, its spectrum is the same as the solar spectrum. The material producing the zodiacal light is located in a lens-shaped volume of space centered on the sun and extending well out beyond the orbit of Earth. This material is known as the interplanetary dust cloud. Since most of the material is located near the plane of the Solar System, the zodiacal light is seen along the ecliptic. The amount of material needed to produce the observed zodiacal light is quite small. If it were in the form of 1\u00a0mm particles, each with the same albedo (reflecting power) as the Moon, each particle would be 8\u00a0km from its neighbors. The gegenschein may be caused by particles directly opposite the Sun as seen from Earth, which would be in full phase.\nAccording to Nesvorn\u00fd and Jenniskens, when the dust grains are as small as about 150 micrometres in size, they will hit the Earth at an average speed of 14.5\u00a0km/s, many as slowly as 12\u00a0km/s. If so, they pointed out, this comet dust can survive entry in partially molten form, accounting for the unusual attributes of the micrometeorites collected in Antarctica, which do not resemble the larger meteorites known to originate from asteroids. In recent years, observations by a variety of spacecraft have shown significant structure in the zodiacal light including dust bands associated with debris from particular asteroid families and several cometary trails.\nCultural significance.\nAccording to Alexander von Humboldt's \"Kosmos\", Mesoamericans were aware of the zodiacal light before 1500. It was perhaps first reported in print by Joshua Childrey in 1661. The phenomenon was investigated by the astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini in 1683. According to some sources, he explained it by dust particles around the Sun. Other sources state that it was first explained this way by Nicolas Fatio de Duillier, in 1684, whom Cassini advised to study the zodiacal light.\nImportance to Islam.\nThe Islamic prophet Muhammad described zodiacal light in reference to the timing of the five daily prayers, calling it the \"false dawn\" ( '). Muslim oral tradition preserves numerous sayings, or hadith, in which Muhammad describes the difference between the light of false dawn, appearing in the sky long after sunset, and the light of the first band of horizontal light at sunrise, the \"true dawn\" ( '). According to the vast majority of Muslim scholars, navigation twilight is considered the true dawn. Practitioners of Islam use Muhammad's descriptions of zodiacal light to avoid errors in determining the timing of fasting and daily prayers.\nBrian May.\nIn 2007, Brian May, lead guitarist with the band Queen, completed his thesis, \"A Survey of Radial Velocities in the Zodiacal Dust Cloud\", thirty-six years after abandoning it to pursue a career in music. He was able to submit it only because of the minimal amount of research on the topic undertaken during the intervening years. May described the subject as being one that became \"trendy\" again in the 2000s.\nOther planets.\nOther planets, like Venus or Mercury, have shown to have rings of interplanetary dust in their orbital spaces.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
