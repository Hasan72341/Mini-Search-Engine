Napoleon was invading France's neighbours in efforts to build a French Empire, causing a chain of global-scaled conflicts known as the Napoleonic Wars. Here, France's Napoleonic empire saw its rise and fall through events such as Napoleon's attempts to conquer Russia, the War of 1812 (spillover to America), and the Battle of Waterloo (Napoleon's ultimate defeat). Imperialism began to encroach towards African and Asian territories through trade, as the United States saw mass-scaled migration that headed westward towards the American frontier (mostly through the opening of the Oregon Trail.)\nPolitics and wars.\nNapoleonic Wars.\nIn 1810, the French Empire reached its greatest extent. On the continent, the British and Portuguese remained restricted to the area around Lisbon and to besieged C\u00e1diz. Napoleon married Marie-Louise, an Austrian Archduchess, with the aim of ensuring a more stable alliance with Austria and of providing the Emperor with an heir. As well as the French Empire, Napoleon controlled the Swiss Confederation, the Confederation of the Rhine, the Duchy of Warsaw and the Kingdom of Italy. Territories allied with the French included: the Kingdom of Spain, the Kingdom of Westphalia, the Kingdom of Naples, the Principality of Lucca and Piombino, and Napoleon's former enemies, Prussia and Austria. Denmark\u2013Norway also allied with France in opposition to Great Britain and Sweden in the Gunboat War.\nThe French invasion of Russia of 1812 was a turning point, which reduced the French and allied invasion forces (the Grande Arm\u00e9e) to a tiny fraction of their initial strength and triggered a major shift in European politics, as it dramatically weakened the previously dominant French position on the continent. After the disastrous invasion of Russia, a coalition of Austria, Prussia, Russia, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and a number of German States, and the rebels in Spain and Portugal united to battle France in the War of the Sixth Coalition. Two-and-a-half million troops fought in the conflict and the total dead amounted to as many as two million. This era included the battles of Smolensk, Borodino, L\u00fctzen, Bautzen, and the Dresden. It also included the epic Battle of Leipzig in October, 1813 (also known as the Battle of Nations), which was the largest battle of the Napoleonic wars, which drove Napoleon out of Germany.\nThe final stage of the War of the Sixth Coalition, the defense of France in 1814, saw the French Emperor temporarily repulse the vastly superior armies in the Six Days Campaign. Ultimately, the Allies occupied Paris, forcing Napoleon to abdicate and restoring the Bourbons. Napoleon was exiled to Elba. Also in 1814, Denmark\u2013Norway was defeated by Great Britain and Sweden and had to cede the territory of mainland Norway to the King of Sweden at the Treaty of Kiel.\nNapoleon shortly returned from exile, landing in France on March 1, 1815, marking the War of the Seventh Coalition, heading toward Paris while the Congress of Vienna was sitting. On March 13, seven days before Napoleon reached Paris, the powers at the Congress of Vienna ; four days later the United Kingdom, Russia, Austria and Prussia, members of the Seventh Coalition, bound themselves to put 150,000 men each into the field to end his rule. This set the stage for the last conflict in the Napoleonic Wars, the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo, the restoration of the French monarchy for the second time and the permanent exile of Napoleon to the distant island of Saint Helena, where he died in May 1821.\nSpanish American wars of independence.\nSpain in the 1810s was a country in turmoil. Occupied by Napoleon from 1808 to 1814, a massively destructive \"war of independence\" ensued, driven by an emergent Spanish nationalism. Already in 1810, the Caracas and Buenos Aires juntas declared their independence from the Bonapartist government in Spain and sent ambassadors to the United Kingdom. Colombia, once become part of New Granada became the first Spanish colony in South America to declare independence from Spain on 20 July 1810 as the third oldest independent republic in the New World after Haiti and the United States. The British blockade against Spain had also moved most of the Latin American colonies out of the Spanish economic sphere and into the British sphere, with whom extensive trade relations were developed. The remaining Spanish colonies had operated with virtual independence from Madrid after their pronouncement against Joseph Bonaparte.\nThe Spanish government in exile (Cortes of C\u00e1diz) created the first modern Spanish constitution. Even so, agreements made at the Congress of Vienna (where Spain was represented by Pedro G\u00f3mez Labrador, Marquis of Labrador) would cement international support for the old, absolutist regime in Spain.\nKing Ferdinand VII, who assumed the throne after Napoleon was driven out of Spain, refused to agree to the liberal Spanish Constitution of 1812 on his accession to the throne in 1814. The Spanish Empire in the New World had largely supported the cause of Ferdinand VII over the Bonapartist pretender to the throne in the midst of the Napoleonic Wars. When Ferdinand's rule was restored, these juntas were cautious of abandoning their autonomy, and an alliance between local elites, merchant interests, nationalists, and liberals opposed to the abrogation of the Constitution of 1812 rose up against the Spanish in the New World.\nThe arrival of Spanish forces in the American colonies began in 1814, and was briefly successful in restoring central control over large parts of the Empire. Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, the leader of revolutionary forces in New Granada, was briefly forced into exile in British-controlled Jamaica, and independent Haiti. In 1816, however, Bolivar found enough popular support that he was able to return to South America, and in a daring march from Venezuela to New Granada (Colombia), he defeated Spanish forces at the Battle of Boyac\u00e1 in 1819, ending Spanish rule in Colombia. Venezuela was liberated June 24, 1821, when Bolivar destroyed the Spanish army on the fields of Carabobo on the Battle of Carabobo. Argentina declared its independence in 1816 (though it had been operating with virtual independence as a British client since 1807 after successfully resisting a British invasion). Chile was retaken by Spain in 1814, but lost permanently in 1817 when an army under Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn, for the first time in history, crossed the Andes Mountains from Argentina to Chile, and went on to defeat Spanish royalist forces at the Battle of Chacabuco in 1817.\nSpain would also lose Florida to the United States during this decade. First, in 1810, the Republic of West Florida declared its independence from Spain, and was quickly annexed by the United States. Later, in 1818, the United States invaded Florida, resulting in the Adams-On\u00eds Treaty, wherein Spain ceded the rest of Florida to the United States.\nIn 1820, Mexico, Peru, Ecuador, and Central America still remained under Spanish control. Although Mexico had been in revolt in 1811 under Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, resistance to Spanish rule had largely been confined to small guerrilla bands in the countryside. King Ferdinand was still dissatisfied with the loss of so much of the Empire and resolved to retake it. A large expedition was assembled in C\u00e1diz with the aim of reconquest. However, Ferdinand's plans would be disrupted by Liberal Revolution, and Ferdinand was eventually forced to give up all of the New World colonies, except for Cuba and Puerto Rico.\nWar of 1812.\nIn 1812, the United States declared war on Britain in the War of 1812. The U.S. reasons for war included the humiliation in the \"Chesapeake incident\" of 1807, continued British impressment of American sailors into the Royal Navy, restrictions on trade with France, and arming hostile American Indians in Ohio and the western territories. United States President James Madison signed a declaration of war on June 18, 1812.\nThe United States conducted two failed invasion attempts in 1812, first by General William Hull across the Detroit River into what is now Windsor, Ontario, and a second offensive at the Niagara peninsula. A major American success came in 1813, when the American Navy destroyed the British fleet on Lake Erie, and forced the British and their American Indian allies to retreat back toward Niagara. They were intercepted and destroyed by General William Henry Harrison at the Battle of the Thames in October 1813. Tecumseh, the leader of the tribal confederation, was killed, and his Indian coalition disintegrated.\nAt sea, the powerful Royal Navy blockaded much of the coastline, conducting frequent raids. The most famous episode was a series of British raids on the shores of Chesapeake Bay, including an attack on Washington that resulted in the British burning of the White House, the Capitol, the Navy Yard, and other public buildings, in the \"Burning of Washington\" in 1814.\nOnce Napoleon was defeated in 1814, France and Britain became allies and Britain ended the trade restrictions and the impressment of American sailors. Running out of reasons for war and stuck in a military stalemate, the two countries signed the Treaty of Ghent on December 24, 1814. News of the peace treaty took two months to reach the U.S., during which fighting continued. In this interim, the British made one last major invasion, attempting to capture New Orleans, but were decisively defeated with very heavy losses by General Andrew Jackson at the Battle of New Orleans in January 1815. The ending of the war opened a long era of peaceful relations between the United States and the British Empire.\n1804\u20131813 Russo-Persian War.\nThe 1804\u20131813 Russo-Persian War was one of the many wars between the Persian Empire and Imperial Russia, and was well underway at the beginning of the decade. In 1810, the Persians scaled up their efforts late in the war, declaring a holy war on Imperial Russia. However, Russia's superior technology and tactics ensured a series of strategic victories. Even when the French were in occupation of the Russian capital Moscow, Russian forces in the south were not recalled but continued their offensive against Persia, culminating in Pyotr Kotlyarevsky's victories at Aslanduz and Lenkoran, in 1812 and 1813 respectively. Upon the Persian surrender, the terms of the Treaty of Gulistan ceded the vast majority of the previously disputed territories to Imperial Russia. This led to the region's once-powerful khans being decimated and forced to pay homage to Russia.\nConcert of Europe.\nBy 1815, Europe had been almost constantly at war. During this time, the military conquests of France had resulted in the spread of liberalism throughout much of the continent, resulting in many states adopting the Napoleonic Code. Largely as a reaction to the radicalism of the French Revolution, the victorious powers of the Napoleonic Wars resolved to suppress liberalism and nationalism, and revert largely to the \"status quo\" of Europe prior to 1789.\nThe result was the Concert of Europe, also known as the \"Congress System\". It was the balance of power that existed in Europe from 1815 until the early 20th century. Its founding members were the United Kingdom, Austrian Empire, Russian Empire and Kingdom of Prussia, the members of the Quadruple Alliance responsible for the downfall of the First French Empire; in time France became established as a fifth member of the concert. At first, the leading personalities of the system were British foreign secretary Lord Castlereagh, Austrian chancellor Klemens Wenzel, Prince von Metternich and Tsar Alexander I of Russia.\nThe Kingdom of Prussia, Austrian Empire and Russian Empire formed the Holy Alliance with the expressed intent of preserving Christian social values and traditional monarchism. Every member of the coalition promptly joined the Alliance, save for the United Kingdom.\nAmong the meetings of the Powers in the latter part of the 1810s were the Congresses of Vienna (1814\u20131815), Aix-la-Chappelle (1818), and Carlsbad (1819).\nScience and technology.\nSteamboats.\nThe 1810s continued a trend of increasing commercial viability of steamboats in North America, following the early success of Robert Fulton and others in the preceding years. In 1811 the first in a continuously operating line of river steamboats left the dock at Pittsburgh to steam down the Ohio River to the Mississippi and on to New Orleans. Inventor John Stevens' boat, the \"Juliana\", began operation as the first steam-powered ferry October 11, 1811, with service between New York, and Hoboken, New Jersey. John Molson's PS \"Accommodation\" was the first steamboat on the St. Lawrence and in Canada. Unlike Fulton, Molson did not show a profit. Molson had also two paddle steamboats \"Swiftsure\" of 1811 and \"Malsham\" of 1813 with engines by B&amp;W. The experience of these vessels, especially that they could now offer a regular service, being independent of wind and weather, helped make the new system of propulsion commercially viable, and as a result its application to the more open waters of the Great Lakes was next considered. That idea went on hiatus due to the War of 1812.\nIn a 25-day trip in 1815, the \"Enterprise\" further demonstrated the commercial potential of the steamboat with a 2,200-mile voyage from New Orleans to Pittsburgh. In 1817, a consortium in Sackets Harbor, New York, funded the construction of the first US steamboat, \"Ontario\", to run on Lake Ontario and the Great Lakes, beginning the growth of lake commercial and passenger traffic.\nThe first commercially successful steamboat in Europe, Henry Bell's \"Comet\" of 1812, started a rapid expansion of steam services on the Firth of Clyde, and within four years a steamer service was in operation on the inland Loch Lomond, a forerunner of the lake steamers still gracing Swiss lakes. On the Clyde itself, within ten years of \"Comet's\" start in 1812 there were nearly fifty steamers, and services had started across the Irish Sea to Belfast and on many British estuaries. P.S.\"Thames\", ex \"Argyle\" was the first seagoing steamer in Europe, having steamed from Glasgow to London in May 1815. P.S.\"Tug\", the first tugboat, was launched by the Woods Brothers, Port Glasgow, on November 5, 1817; in the summer of 1817 she was the first steamboat to travel round the North of Scotland to the East Coast.\nThe first steamship credited with crossing the Atlantic Ocean between North America and Europe was the American ship \"SS Savannah\", though she was actually a hybrid between a steamship and a sailing ship. The \"SS Savannah\" left the port of Savannah, Georgia, on May 22, 1819, arriving in Liverpool, England, on June 20, 1819; her steam engine having been in use for part of the time on 18 days (estimates vary from 8 to 80 hours).\nCulture.\nLiterature.\nLord Byron, regarded as one of the greatest British poets and remains widely read and influential, wrote his most well-known work during this decade. Amongst Byron's works are the brief poems \"She Walks in Beauty\", \"When We Two Parted\", and \"So, we'll go no more a roving\", in addition to the narrative poems \"Childe Harold's Pilgrimage\" and \"Don Juan\".\nOther events in literature:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is considered part of the Classical era, epoch, or historical period.\nThis century marked the height of Classical Greek civilization in all of its aspects. By the year 400 BC Greek philosophy, art, literature and architecture had spread far and wide, with the numerous independent Greek colonies that had sprung up throughout the lands of the eastern Mediterranean.\nArguably the most important series of political events in this period were the conquests of Alexander, bringing about the collapse of the once formidable Persian Empire and spreading Greek culture far into the east. Alexander dreamt of an east/west union, but when his short life ended in 323 BC, his vast empire was plunged into civil war as his generals each carved out their own separate kingdoms. Thus began the Hellenistic age, a period characterized by a more absolute approach to rule, with Greek kings taking on royal trappings and setting up hereditary successions. While a degree of democracy still existed in some of the remaining independent Greek cities, many scholars see this age as marking the end of classical Greece.\nIn India, the Maurya Empire was founded in 322 BC by Chandragupta Maurya who rapidly expanded his power westwards across central and western India, taking advantage of the disruptions of local powers in the wake of the withdrawal westward by the armies of Alexander.\nChina in the 4th century BC entered an era of constant warfare known as the Warring States period. The period saw the rapid rise of large states (such as Chu) over smaller ones thanks to technological advancement. Though the period has usually been characterized by historians as being excessively violent compared to the Spring and Autumn period, it was also punctuated by several cultural and social growths through the expansion of several different sects of Confucianism and Taoism, and the formulation of Legalist thought.\nEvents.\n380s BC.\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nSovereign states.\nSee: List of political entities in the 4th century BC.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This was unacceptable to Rome, and the ensuing tensions culminated in the Roman\u2013Parthian War of 58\u201363. Concurrently, the Roman conquest of Britain continued, with Caratacus being defeated in 50 and tribes of modern Wales being subdued in 58 to 59.

The revolt led to the sacking of several Roman cities, but was ultimately quelled by governor Gaius Suetonius Paulinus. In 63, the Roman\u2013Parthian War came to an end with the Treaty of Rhandeia. In 66, the First Jewish-Roman War began, as Jewish rebels fought against Roman rule. Near the end of the decade in 69, the Year of the Four Emperors saw a period of civil war and political instability in the Roman Empire, as four different men (Galba, Otho, Vitellius, and Vespasian) claimed the title of Emperor within the span of a year. Ultimately, the year ended with the ascension of Vespasian to the throne and the beginning of the Flavian Dynasty. In East Asia, the state of Funan was established, while China continued its golden age.\nIn 62, an earthquake of an estimated magnitude of between 5 and 6 and a maximum intensity of IX or X on the Mercalli scale struck the towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum, severely damaging them. The towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum both suffered major damage, with damage to some buildings also reported from Naples and Nuceria. Seneca reported the death of a flock of 600 sheep that he attributed to the effects of poisonous gases. Later, in 64, the Great Fire of Rome began in the merchant shops around Rome's chariot stadium, Circus Maximus. After six days, the fire was brought under control, but before the damage could be assessed, the fire reignited and burned for another three days. In the aftermath of the fire, two-thirds of Rome had been destroyed. According to Tacitus and later Christian tradition, Emperor Nero blamed the devastation on the Christian community in the city, initiating the empire's first persecution against the Christians.\nIn the Roman Empire, Christianity continued to spread, despite a campaign of persecution being initiated under Emperor Nero in 64. According to tradition, the apostles Peter and Paul were both martyred during this period: Traditionally, Roman authorities allegedly sentenced Peter to death by crucifixion at Vatican Hill. In accordance with the apocryphal Acts of Peter, he was crucified head down. As for Paul, the Second Epistle to Timothy states that he was arrested in Troad and brought back to Rome, where he was imprisoned and put on trial before being executed. The White Horse Temple, the first Buddhist temple in China, was traditionally constructed in 68, though it is not recorded in contemporary sources before 289.\nIn 62 or 64, the Baths of Nero were constructed. It stood between the Pantheon and the Stadium of Domitian and were listed among the most notable buildings in the city by Roman authors and became a much-frequented venue. In his final years, Seneca the Younger wrote \"De Providentia\" (discussing the problem of evil), \"De Beneficiis\" (discussing the award and reception of gifts and favours within society), and compiled a collection of 124 written near the end of his life. After Seneca's death in 65, a play named \"Octavia\" was written: the Roman tragedy focuses on three days in the year 62 during which Nero divorced and exiled his wife Claudia Octavia and married another (Poppaea Sabina). The play also deals with the irascibility of Nero and his inability to take heed of the philosopher Seneca's advice to rein in his passions. The \"Pharsalia\", a poem detailing Caesar's civil war (49\u201345 BC), was also written during this decade.\nManning (2008) tentatively estimates the world population in AD 60 as 249 million.\nDemographics.\nDue to lack of reliable demographic data, estimates of the world population in the 1st century vary wildly, with estimates for AD 1 varying from 150 to 300 million.

After this major victory, the Romans continued to clear pockets of Jewish resistance, with the final stronghold taken being Masada (73). The Flavian dynasty, which included emperors Vespasian and Titus, ruled the empire during this decade. During their reign, the Romans faced military challenges from various sources, including clashes with British and Germanic tribes. However, the Romans were largely successful in defeating these tribes, expanding their territories and consolidating their power. Following the death of Vologases I in 78, Parthia saw internal conflict as Vologases II and Pacorus II competed for the throne. In China, the Han\u2013Xiongnu War was re-invigorated, with the Han defeating the Northern Xiongnu in the Battle of Yiwulu (73). In 75, Emperor Ming of Han died, being succeeded by Emperor Zhang: the reign of these two emperors is considered to have been a golden age.\nThe destruction of Jerusalem and the Second Temple during the First Jewish\u2013Roman War marked a major turning point in Jewish history. The loss of mother-city and temple necessitated a reshaping of Jewish culture to ensure its survival. Judaism's Temple-based sects, including the priesthood and the Sadducees, diminished in importance. A new form of Judaism that became known as Rabbinic Judaism developed out of Pharisaic school and, centuries later, eventually became the mainstream form of the religion. Many followers of Jesus of Nazareth also survived the city's destruction. They spread his teachings across the Roman Empire, giving rise to the new religion of Christianity.\nIn the autumn of 79, Mount Vesuvius violently spewed forth a deadly cloud of super-heated tephra and gases to a height of , ejecting molten rock, pulverized pumice and hot ash. The event destroyed several towns and minor settlements in the area, at the time part of the Roman Empire. Pompeii and Herculaneum, obliterated and buried underneath massive pyroclastic surges and ashfall deposits, are the most famous examples. The total population of both cities was over 20,000. The remains of over 1,500 people have been found at Pompeii and Herculaneum so far, although the total death toll from the eruption remains unknown.\nThe period also saw significant architectural and engineering accomplishments, such as the construction of the Colosseum in Rome. In 75, Vespasian erected a colossal statue of Apollo, begun under Nero, and he dedicated a stage of the theatre of Marcellus. Valerius Flaccus wrote the \"Argonautica\", an epic poem. Pliny the Elder composed the 10-volume \"Natural History\", covering topics including astronomy, mathematics, geography, ethnography, anthropology, human physiology, zoology, botany, agriculture, horticulture, pharmacology, mining, mineralogy, sculpture, art, and precious stones.\nManning (2008) tentatively estimates the world population in AD 70 to have been 250 million.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Domitian became Roman emperor in AD 81: The military campaigns undertaken during his reign were generally defensive in nature, as the Emperor rejected the idea of expansionist warfare. His most significant military contribution was the development of the Limes Germanicus, which encompassed a vast network of roads, forts and watchtowers constructed along the Rhine river to defend the Empire. Nevertheless, several important wars were fought in Gaul, against the Chatti, and across the Danube frontier against the Suebi, the Sarmatians, and the Dacians (see Domitian's Dacian War). In northern Britain, the Romans defeated local tribes in the Battle of Mons Graupius (AD 83). In China, the Han\u2013Xiongnu War continued, with the Battle of the Altai Mountains (AD 89) bringing the Northern Xiongnu to the brink of collapse. The death of Emperor Zhang of Han ended a golden age.\nIn spring of AD 80, a fire broke out in Rome and burned large parts of the city for three days and three nights. Although the extent of the damage was not as disastrous as during the Great Fire of 64 and crucially spared the many districts of insulae, Cassius Dio records a long list of important public buildings that were destroyed, including Agrippa's Pantheon, the Temple of Jupiter, the Diribitorium, parts of the Theatre of Pompey, and the Saepta Julia among others. Emperor Titus personally compensated for the damaged regions. According to Suetonius, a plague also broke out during the fire.

In 90, Dou Xian dispatched General Geng Kui and Shizi of the Southern Xiongnu with 8000 light cavalry to attack the Northern Chanyu, encamped at Heyun (\u6cb3\u96f2). There, the Han killed 8000 men and captured several thousands. By 91, the last remnants of the Northern Xiongnu had migrated west towards the Ili River valley, ending the war. After the downfall of the Xiongnu, the Xianbei replaced them with a loose confederacy from 93.\nThe Roman Empire did not see any significant military action this decade, excepting clashes along the Danube in 92. Economically, the empire saw reforms by Nerva after the death of Domitian in 96, including but not limited to a string of economic reforms intended to alleviate the burden of taxation from the most needy Romans. Before long, Nerva's expenses strained the economy of Rome and, although perhaps not ruinous to the extent once suggested by Syme, necessitated the formation of a special commission of economy to drastically reduce expenditures.\nAccording to some historians, Jews and Christians were heavily persecuted toward the end of Domitian's reign (89-96). The Book of Revelation, which mentions at least one instance of martyrdom (Rev 2:13; cf. 6:9), is thought by many scholars to have been written during Domitian's reign. According to Barnes, \"Melito, Tertullian, and Bruttius stated that Domitian persecuted the Christians. Melito and Bruttius vouchsafe no details, Tertullian only that Domitian soon changed his mind and recalled those whom he had exiled\". A minority of the historians have maintained that there was little or no anti-Christian activity during Domitian's time. The lack of consensus by historians about the extent of persecution during the reign of Domitian derives from the fact that while accounts of persecution exist, these accounts are cursory or their reliability is debated.\nIn AD 92, the Flavian Palace was completed. In AD 97, the Forum of Nerva was completed. Josephus wrote \"Antiquities of the Jews\" (covering the history of the Jewish people), \"Against Apion\" (a defense of Judaism as a classical religion and philosophy against criticism by Apion), and \"The Life of Flavius Josephus\" (an autobiographical text where Josephus details his own life).

Emperor Trajan, who ruled from 98 to 117 AD, launched several successful military campaigns, including the Dacian wars (101\u2013106) and the possibly violent conquest of Nabataea (106). The conquest of Dacia in 106 secured its rich gold mines, and it is estimated that Dacia then contributed 700 million Denarii per annum to the Roman economy, providing finance for Rome's future campaigns and assisting with the rapid expansion of Roman towns throughout Europe. Furthermore, the conquest changed the balance of power in the region, leading to a renewed anti-Roman alliance of local Germanic and Celtic tribes. However, within the annexed territory and surrounds, the material advantages of being part of the Roman system were not lost on the majority of the surviving Dacian aristocracy. Thus began the process by which most modern Romanian historians and linguists believe that many of the Dacians subsequently became romanized (see Origin of Romanians). Alimenta, a Roman welfare program that had been initiated by Nerva in 98, continued to be in operation during this decade.\nIn East Asia, the Han dynasty saw a succession of rulers: Emperor He was succeeded by Emperor Shang in 106, who was succeeded by Emperor An that same year. However, the young emperor An did not rule in his own right, with Deng Sui instead being regent from 106 onwards. Deng Sui showed herself to be an able regent who did not tolerate corruption, even by her own family members. She also carried out criminal law reforms. For example, in 107, she issued an edict that extended the period for death penalty appeals. She cut the expenses of the royal court, like the making of expensive handicrafts such as jade and ivory carvings and sent home palace attendants with superfluous functions. She also demanded less tribute from the provinces. While Empress, she twice opened the imperial granaries to feed the hungry; forced the reduction of income landlords received from the land they rented out; she repaired waterways and cut court rituals and banquets. She also saw rebellions from the South Xiongnu and Qiang, the latter of which would not be quelled until the next decade. In West Asia, Parthia saw a revolt by Osroes I against Pacorus II in 109. South America saw the emergence of the Moche culture.\nEmperor Trajan corresponded with Pliny the Younger on the subject of how to deal with the Christians of Pontus. The theologian Edward Burton wrote that this correspondence shows there were no laws condemning Christians at that time. There was an \"abundance of precedent (common law) for suppressing foreign superstitions\" but no general law which prescribed \"the form of trial or the punishment; nor had there been any special enactment which made Christianity a crime\". Even so, Pliny implies that putting Christians on trial was not rare, and while Christians in his district had committed no illegal acts like robbery or adultery, Pliny \"put persons to death, though they were guilty of no crime, and without the authority of any law\" and believed his emperor would accept his actions. Trajan did, and sent back a qualified approval. He told Pliny to continue to prosecute Christians, but not to accept anonymous denunciations in the interests of justice as well as of \"the spirit of the age\". Non-citizens who admitted to being Christians and refused to recant, however, were to be executed \"for obstinacy\". Citizens were sent to Rome for trial. Mithraism, a Roman mystery religion viewed as a rival of early Christianity, had developed by this time.(phttps://)\nTrajan invested heavily in the provision of popular amusements. He carried out a \"massive reconstruction\" of the Circus Maximus, which was already the Empire's biggest and best appointed circuit for the immensely popular sport of chariot racing. The Circus also hosted religious theatrical spectacles and games, and public processions on a grand scale. Trajan's reconstruction, completed by 103, was modestly described by Trajan himself as \"adequate\" for the Roman people. Furthermore, the decade saw the construction of Trajan's Bridge, the Baths of Trajan, and Roman roads such as Via Traiana and Via Traiana Nova. The \"Buddhacharita\", a Sanskrit poem describing the birth and reign of the Third Mauryan Emperor Ashoka, was composed around this time. Plutarch wrote \"Parallel Lives\", a series of 48 biographies of famous men, arranged in pairs to illuminate their common moral virtues or failings. Tacitus wrote \"Histories\", which covers the history of Rome from 69 to 96. Juvenal wrote \"Satires\", a collection of satirical poems. Furthermore, lions had become extinct in Greece by this period.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was an animistic culture which existed prior the introduction of Buddhism. A legend of the 4th century Prince Yamato Takeru alludes to the borders of the Yamato and battlegrounds in the area. A frontier was obviously somewhere close to the later Izumo province (the eastern part of today's Shimane Prefecture). Another frontier, in Ky\u016bsh\u016b, was apparently somewhere north of today's Kumamoto prefecture. The legend specifically states that there was an eastern land in Honsh\u016b \"whose people disobeyed the imperial court\", against whom Yamato Takeru was sent to fight. That rivalling country may have been located rather close to the Yamato nucleus area itself, or relatively far away. The today Kai province is mentioned as one of the locations where prince Yamato Takeru sojourned in his said military expedition.\nNorthern frontier of this age was also explained in \"Kojiki\" as the legend of Shido Sh\u014dgun's (\u56db\u9053\u5c06\u8ecd: Sh\u014dguns to four ways) expedition. Out of four sh\u014dguns, \u014cbiko set northward to Koshi and his son Take Nunakawawake set to eastern states.

In 115, the Roman Army overran northern Mesopotamia, commencing Trajan's Parthian campaign. The war was initially successful for the Romans, who, as a result, attained their greatest territorial extent. However, a series of setbacks, including wide-scale Jewish uprisings in the Eastern Mediterranean and North Africa and Trajan's death in 117, led to a Roman withdrawal. Trajan was succeeded by Hadrian, who withdrew from Mesopotamia and suppressed the last remnants of the Jewish revolt. Near the end of the decade, a rebellion in Roman Britain was suppressed. In 118, the Chinese Eastern Han dynasty suppressed a revolt by Qiang tribes which had erupted the prior decade.\nAn earthquake occurred in Antioch in 115, killing an estimated 260,000 people. The cities of Antioch, Daphne and Apamea were almost completely destroyed. Trees were uprooted and felled; people were thrown down to the ground. It had an estimated magnitude of 7.5 on the surface wave magnitude scale and an estimated maximum intensity of XI (\"Extreme\") on the Mercalli intensity scale. Antioch and surrounding areas were devastated with a great loss of life and property. It triggered a local tsunami that badly damaged the harbour at Caesarea Maritima. The Roman Emperor Trajan was caught in the earthquake, as was his successor Hadrian. Although the consul Marcus Pedo Vergilianus was killed, they escaped with only slight injuries and later began a program to rebuild the city.\nIn architecture, the decade saw the construction of Trajan's Forum (the last of the Imperial fora to be constructed in ancient Rome), Trajan's Column (which commemorates the Roman victory in the Dacian Wars), the Arch of Trajan, and the Roman Pantheon. Around this time, Juvenal wrote \"Satires\", a collection of satirical poems.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In the prior decade, he had succeeded Emperor Trajan, who had expanded the empire to its greatest extent. Hadrian, in contrast, adopted a more defensive foreign policy, focusing on consolidating the empire's borders and improving its infrastructure, such as Hadrian's Wall in Britain. There was almost a renewed war with Parthia, but the threat was averted when Hadrian succeeded in negotiating a peace in 123 (according to the \"Historia Augusta\", disputed). Furthermore, Hadrian enacted, through the jurist Salvius Julianus, the first attempt to codify Roman law. This was the Perpetual Edict, according to which the legal actions of praetors became fixed statutes and, as such, could no longer be subjected to personal interpretation or change by any magistrate other than the Emperor.\nThe Chinese Eastern Han dynasty saw the death of regent Deng Sui in 121, after which Emperor An took on the reins of the imperial administration. In 121, there were again Qiang and Xianbei rebellions, which would continue to plague Emperor An for the rest of his reign. The only border where there were Han accomplishments during Emperor An's reign was on the northwestern front\u2014the Xiyu (modern Xinjiang and former Soviet central Asia)\u2014where Ban Chao's son Ban Yong () was able to reestablish Han dominance over a number of kingdoms. Emperor An was succeeded by Marquess of Beixiang in 125, who reigned for a short time before being succeeded by Emperor Shun of Han that same year. At the start of Emperor Shun's reign, the people were hopeful that he would reform the political situation from the pervasive corruption under the Yans. However, the teenage emperor proved to be a kind but weak ruler. While he trusted certain honest officials, he also trusted many corrupt eunuchs, who quickly grabbed power.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In the context of the Eastern Mediterranean, it is the mid-point of the Hellenistic period.\nFresh from its victories in the Second Punic War, the Roman Republic continued its expansion in the western Mediterranean, campaigning in the Iberian Peninsula throughout the century and annexing the North African coast after the destruction of the city of Carthage at the end of the Third Punic War. They became the dominant force in the Aegean by destroying Antigonid Macedonia in the Macedonian Wars and Corinth in the Achaean War. The Hellenistic kingdoms of Ptolemaic Egypt and Attalid Pergamon entered into subordinate relationships with the Romans \u2013 Pergamon was eventually annexed. The end of the century witnessed the evolution of the Roman army from a citizen army into a voluntary professional force, which later scholars would misattribute to putative reforms by noted general and statesman Gaius Marius (the so-called Marian Reforms).\nIn the Near East, the other major Hellenistic kingdom, the Seleucid Empire collapsed into civil war in the middle of the century, following the loss of Asia Minor to the Romans and the conquest of the Iranian plateau and Mesopotamia by the Parthian empire. Outlying regions became independent kingdoms, notably the Hasmonean kingdom in Judaea.\nIn East Asia, China reached a high point under the Han dynasty. The Han Empire extended its boundaries from Korea in the east to Vietnam in the South to the borders of modern-day Kazakhstan in the west. The nomadic Xiongnu were at the height of their power at the beginning of the century, collecting tribute from the Han. Their victories over the Yuezhi set off a chain of westward migrations in Central Asia. Han efforts to find allies against the Xiongnu by exploring the lands to their west would ultimately lead to the opening of the Silk Road.\nIn South Asia, the Mauryan Empire in India collapsed when Brihadnatha, the last emperor, was killed by Pushyamitra Shunga, a Mauryan general who founded of the Shunga Empire.

This balance was shattered when conflict arose between ancient Carthage and the Roman Republic. In the following decades, the Carthaginian Republic was first humbled and then destroyed by the Romans in the First and Second Punic Wars. Following the Second Punic War, Rome became the most important power in the western Mediterranean.\nIn the eastern Mediterranean, the Seleucid Empire and Ptolemaic Kingdom, successor states to the empire of Alexander the Great, fought a series of Syrian Wars for control over the Levant. In mainland Greece, the short-lived Antipatrid dynasty of Macedon was overthrown and replaced by the Antigonid dynasty in 294 BC, a royal house that would dominate the affairs of Hellenistic Greece for roughly a century until the stalemate of the First Macedonian War against Rome. Macedon would also lose the Cretan War against the Greek city-state of Rhodes and its allies.\nIn India, Ashoka ruled the Maurya Empire. The Pandya, Chola and Chera dynasties of the classical age flourished in the ancient Tamil country.\nThe Warring States period in China drew to a close, with Qin Shi Huang conquering the six other nation-states and establishing the short-lived Qin dynasty, the first empire of China, which was followed in the same century by the long-lasting Han dynasty. However, a brief interregnum and civil war existed between the Qin and Han periods known as the Chu-Han contention, lasting until 202 BC with the ultimate victory of Liu Bang over Xiang Yu.\nThe Protohistoric Period began in Korea. In the following century the Chinese Han dynasty would conquer the Gojoseon kingdom of northern Korea. The Xiongnu were at the height of their power in Mongolia.

This period saw the rise of two great philosophical schools of the east, Jainism and Buddhism. \nThis period saw Mahavira and Buddha spreading their respective teachings in the northern plains of India. This essentially changed the socio-cultural and political dynamics of the region of South Asia. Buddhism would later go on to become one of the major world religions.\nThis period also saw the work of Yaska, who created Nirukta, that would lay the foundation stone for Sanskrit grammar and is one of the oldest works on grammar known to mankind.\nThis century is also traditionally recognized as the classical period of the Greeks, which would continue all the way through the 4th century until the time of Alexander the Great. The life of Socrates represented a major milestone in Greek philosophy though his teachings only survive through the work of his students, most notably Plato and Xenophon. The tragedians Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, as well as the comedian Aristophanes all date from this era and many of their works are still considered classics of the western theatrical canon.\nThe Persian Wars, fought between a coalition of Greek cities and the vast Achaemenid Persian Empire was a pivotal moment in Greek politics. The Greeks successfully prevented the annexation of Greece by the Persians in Battle of Plataea, Battle of Mycale, and further counter attacks. Afterwards, Sparta, the dominant power in the coalition, had no intention of further offensive action and considered the war over. Meanwhile, Athens counter-attacked, liberating Greek subjects of the Persian Empire up and down the Ionian coast and mobilizing a new coalition, the Delian League. Tensions between Athens, and its growing imperialistic ambitions as leader of the Delian League, and the traditionally dominant Sparta led to a protracted stalemate in the Peloponnesian War.\nSovereign states.\nSee: List of sovereign states in the 5th century BC.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Muslim world was in its Islamic Golden Age. China was in its Song dynasty, Korea was in its Goryeo dynasty, Vietnam was in its Anterior L\u00ea dynasty and Japan was in its classical Heian period. India was divided into a number of lesser empires, such as the Eastern Chalukyas, Pala Empire (Kamboja Pala dynasty; Mahipala), Chola dynasty (Rajaraja I), Yadava dynasty, etc. Sub-Saharan Africa had developing urban centers and empires such as the Ghana Empire of the Wagadu, and the Trans-Saharan slave trade was beginning to be an important factor in the formation of the Sahelian kingdoms. The pre-Columbian New World was in a time of general transition in many regions. Wari and Tiwanaku cultures receded in power and influence while Chachapoya and Chim\u00fa cultures rose to prominence in South America. In Mesoamerica, the Maya Terminal Classic period saw the decline of many grand polities of the Pet\u00e9n like Palenque and Tikal yet a renewed vigor and greater construction phases of sites in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula like Chichen Itza and Uxmal. Mitla, with Mixtec influence, became the more important site of the Zapotec, overshadowing the waning Monte Alb\u00e1n. Cholula flourished in central Mexico, as did Tula, the center of Toltec culture.\nWorld population is estimated to have been between c. 250 and 310 million.\nEvents.\nIslamic world.\nThe Muslim world was in its Golden Age; still organised in caliphates, it continued to be dominated by the Abbasid Caliphate, with the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba to the west, the Fatimid Caliphate in North Africa, and experienced ongoing campaigns in Africa and in India. At the time, Persia was in a period of instability, with various polities seceding from Abbasid rule, among whom the Ghaznavids would emerge as the most powerful.\nThe Islamic world was reaching the peak of its historical scientific achievements. Important scholars and scientists who flourished in AD 1000 include Al-Zahrawi (Abcasis), Ibn Yunus (publishes his astronomical treatise \"Al-Zij al-Hakimi al-Kabir\" in Cairo in c. 1000), Abu Sahl al-Quhi (Kuhi), Abu-Mahmud Khujandi, Abu Nasr Mansur, Abu al-Wafa' al-Buzjani, Ahmad ibn Fadlan, Ali Ibn Isa, Al-Karaji (al-Karkhi), Ibn al-Haytham (\"Book of Optics\"), Avicenna, Averroes, and Al-Biruni.\nBy this time, the Turkic migration from the Eurasian Steppe had reached Eastern Europe, and most of the Turkic tribes (Khazars, Bulgars, Pechenegs etc.) had been Islamized.\nBabylon abandoned.\nBabylon was abandoned around this year.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This opposition and the desertion of some of his Spanish troops diminishes his numbers by half, but he reaches the river Rh\u00f4ne facing little resistance from the tribes of southern Gaul.\n* A Roman army under the consul Publius Cornelius Scipio is transported by sea to Massilia (modern Marseille) to prevent Hannibal from advancing on Italy. Scipio himself returns to Italy to take command of the defences in northern Italy on learning Hannibal has already crossed the Rh\u00f4ne.\n* Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus, Publius' brother, takes over the command of the army at Massilia and invades Spain.\n* Fall of Saguntum to Hannibal of Carthage (or 219)\n* In response to the threat of Hannibal the Romans assemble three armies:\n* The consul prior, Publius Cornelius Scipio, raises two Roman legions and two Latin alae for a total of 22,000 infantry and 2,200 cavalry. He is also assigned 60 warships and hundreds of transports. Scipio receives the Iberian Peninsula as his area of operations (his imperium).\n* The consul posterior, Tiberius Sempronius Longus, also raises two Roman legions and two Latin alae for a total of 24,000 infantry and 2,400 cavalry. He gathers a fleet of 180 warships and hundreds of transports. Longus receives Sicily and Africa as his area of operation (his imperium) and manages to carry out the capture of Malta from the Carthaginians. He was to invade Africa and attack Carthage directly until the Roman Senate orders him to travel from Sicily to reinforce Scipio's troops.\n* Praetor Lucius Manlius Vulso also receives two legions and raises 10,000 allied infantry and 1,000 allied cavalry (for a total of 18,000 infantry and 1,600 cavalry) and is sent into Cisalpine Gaul to keep an eye on the Celtic tribes.\n* September \u2013 Battle of the Rh\u00f4ne Crossing: A Carthaginian victory over the Volcae opens Hannibal's way into Italy.\n* September/October \u2013 Hannibal's crossing of the Alps: Hannibal takes around 38 North African war elephants across the Alps from Gaul into Cisalpine Gaul to invade Rome. Almost none of the elephants survive the harsh conditions. This leads to the Romans cancelling their invasion of Africa.\n* late November \u2013 Battle of Ticinus: Hannibal defeats Scipio.\n* December 22/23 \u2013 Battle of the Trebia: Hannibal defeats the combined Roman armies under Sempronius and Scipio.\n* Negotiations between the new Egyptian King Ptolemy IV and the Seleucid King Antiochus III collapse, and Antiochus III renews his advance, overrunning Ptolemy's forward defences, and gaining territory in Lebanon, Palestine and Phoenicia.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It consists of the SS109, L110, and SS111 cartridges. On 28 October 1980, under STANAG 4172, it was standardized as the second standard service rifle cartridge for NATO forces as well as many non-NATO countries. Though they are not identical, the 5.56\u00d745mm NATO cartridge family was derived from the .223 Remington cartridge designed by Remington Arms in the early 1960s, which has a near-identical case. However, firing chamber dimensions differ slightly between rifles manufactured for the designated cartridges. The differences may cause unsafe chamber pressures when firing 5.56 NATO in rifles designed for .223 Remington. Therefore, this combination is not recommended. \nHistory.\nIn 1954, the larger 7.62\u00d751mm NATO rifle cartridge was selected as the first standard NATO rifle cartridge. At the time of selection there had been criticism that the recoil power of the 7.62\u00d751mm NATO, when fired from a handheld lightweight modern service rifle in full automatic mode, did not allow for sufficient control, so the automatic follow-on shots would not hit the intended target but scatter around it.\nThe British had extensive evidence through their own experimentation with intermediate cartridges since 1945, and were on the point of adopting the .280 (7\u00a0mm \u00d7 43mm) cartridge when the selection of 7.62\u00d751mm (.308) as the NATO standard was made. The FN company had also been involved in the development of the .280 round, including developing a version of the FN FAL in .280. Concerns about the recoil and overall effectiveness of 7.62\u00a0mm were overruled by the US, and the other NATO nations accepted that standardization was more important than the selection of a cartridge that was otherwise ideal.\nThe development of the cartridge that eventually became the .223 Remington (from which 5.56mm NATO would eventually be developed) would be intrinsically linked to the development of a new lightweight combat rifle. The cartridge and rifle were developed as one unit by Fairchild Industries, Remington Arms, and several engineers working toward a goal developed by U.S. Continental Army Command (CONARC). Early development work began in 1957. A project to create a small-calibre, high-velocity (SCHV) firearm was created. Eugene Stoner of Armalite was invited to scale down the AR-10 (7.62mm) design. Winchester was also invited to participate. The parameters that were requested by CONARC:\nSpringfield Armory's Earle Harvey lengthened the .222 Remington cartridge case to meet the requirements. It was then known as the .224 Springfield. Concurrently with the SCHV project, Springfield Armory was developing a 7.62mm rifle. Harvey was ordered to cease all work on the SCHV to avoid any competition for resources.\nEugene Stoner of Armalite (a division of Fairchild Industries) had been advised to produce a scaled-down version of the 7.62mm AR-10 design. In May 1957, Stoner gave a live-fire demonstration of the prototype of the AR-15 for General Willard G. Wyman, Commander-in-Chief of CONARC. As a result, CONARC ordered rifles to test. Stoner and Sierra Bullet's Frank Snow began work on the .222 Remington cartridge. Using a ballistic calculator, they determined that a 55-grain bullet would have to be fired at to achieve the 500-yard performance necessary.\nRobert Hutton (technical editor of \"Guns &amp; Ammo\" magazine) started development of a powder load to reach the goal. He used DuPont IMR4198, IMR3031, and an Olin powder to work up loads. Testing was done with a Remington 722 rifle with a 22-inch Apex barrel. During a public demonstration, the round successfully penetrated the U.S. steel helmet as required. But testing showed chamber pressures to be excessively high.\nStoner contacted both Winchester and Remington about increasing the case capacity. Remington created a larger cartridge called the \".222 Special\", which was loaded with DuPont IMR4475 powder.\nDuring parallel testing of the T44E4 (future M14) and the AR-15 in 1958, the T44E4 experienced 16 failures per 1,000 rounds fired compared to 6.1 for the AR-15.\nDue to several different .222 caliber cartridges being developed for the SCHV project, the 222 Special was renamed .223 Remington in 1959. In May of that year, a report was produced stating that five- to seven-man squads armed with AR-15 rifles had higher hit probabilities than 11-man squads armed with M-14 rifles. At a 4th of July picnic, Air Force General Curtis LeMay fired an AR-15 and was very impressed with it. He ordered a number of them to replace M2 carbines that were in use by the Air Force. By November, testing at Aberdeen Proving Ground showed that the AR-15 failure rate had declined to 2.5 failures per 1,000 rounds, resulting in the M-16 being approved for Air Force Trials.\nMarksmanship testing in 1961 comparing the M-16 to the M-14 indicated 43% of M-16 shooters achieved \"expert\" while only 22% of M-14 shooters did. General LeMay subsequently ordered 80,000 rifles.\nIn the spring of 1962, Remington submitted the specifications of the .223 Remington to the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute (SAAMI). In July 1962, operational testing ended with a recommendation for adoption of the M-16 rifle chambered in .223 Remington.\nIn September 1963, the .223 Remington cartridge was officially accepted and named \"Cartridge, 5.56mm ball, M193\". The specification includes a Remington-designed bullet and the use of IMR4475 powder which resulted in a muzzle velocity of and a chamber pressure of 52,000 psi.\nIn 1970, NATO members signed an agreement to select a second, smaller caliber cartridge to replace the 7.62\u00d751mm NATO cartridge. Of the cartridges tendered, the .223 Remington (M193) was the basis for a new design created by FN Herstal. The FN-created cartridge was named \"5.56\u00d745mm NATO\" with a military designation of \"SS109\" in NATO and \"M855\" in the U.S. These new SS109 ball cartridges required a 228\u00a0mm (1-in-9 inch) twist rate while adequately stabilizing the longer L110 tracer projectile required an even faster, 178\u00a0mm (1-in-7 inch), twist rate.\nThe Belgian 62\u00a0gr SS109 round was chosen for standardization as the second NATO standard rifle cartridge which led to the October 1980 STANAG 4172. The SS109 used a 62 gr full metal jacket bullet with a seven grain mild steel tip to move the center of gravity rearward, increasing flight stability and thereby the chances of striking the target tip-first at longer ranges, in part to meet a requirement that the bullet be able to penetrate through one side of a WWII U.S. M1 helmet at 500 yd (457 m) (which was also the requirement for the 7.62\u00d751mm NATO). An actual helmet was not used for developmental testing, but an SAE 1010 or SAE 1020 mild steel plate, positioned to be struck at exactly 90 degrees. It had a slightly lower muzzle velocity but better long-range performance due to higher sectional density and a superior drag coefficient.\nThe .223 Remington cartridge inspired an international tendency toward relatively small-sized, lightweight, high-velocity military service cartridges that allow a soldier to carry more ammunition for the same weight compared to their larger and heavier predecessor cartridges, have favourable maximum point-blank range or \"battle zero\" characteristics, and produce relatively low bolt thrust and free recoil impulse, favouring lightweight arms design and automatic fire accuracy.\nCartridge dimensions.\nThe 5.56\u00d745mm NATO has a 1.85 mL (28.5 gr H2O) cartridge case capacity.\n5.56\u00d745mm NATO maximum NATO cartridge dimensions, all sizes in millimeters (mm)\nThe rifling twist rate for this cartridge is 177.8\u00a0mm (1 in 7 in), 6 grooves right hand twist, \u00d8 lands = , \u00d8 grooves = .\nAccording to STANAG 4172 and the official NATO proofing guidelines the 5.56\u00d745mm NATO case can handle up to piezo service pressure. In NATO regulated organizations every rifle cartridge combination has to be proofed at to certify for service issue.\nSTANAG 4172 defines the Belgian ball cartridge SS109 as the NATO reference cartridge and adds a considerable number of technical requirements like a minimum pressure of at the gas port down the long standard proof barrel and primer sensitivity that are not defined by civilian C.I.P. and SAAMI ammunition rulings and recommendations.\nThe NATO military alliance uses a NATO-specific recognized class of procedures to control the safety and quality of firearms ammunition called NATO EPVAT testing. The civilian organisations C.I.P. and SAAMI use less comprehensive test procedures than NATO.\nThe \"NATO Manual of Proof and Inspection AC/225 (LG/3-SG/1) D/8\" stipulates each weapon and component considered vulnerable to the effects of a rapid change in pressure, for example barrels, breech blocks and bolts, will be tested by firing one dry round at a corrected minimum of 25% over pressure and one oiled round at a corrected minimum of 25% over pressure. Over pressure of 25% means 25% in excess of the service pressure resulting for the 5.56\u00d745mm NATO up to (Pmax) piezo service pressure. The service pressure is defined as the mean pressure generated by the service cartridge at a temperature of . Such a high pressure proof is conducted with both the weapon and ammunition conditioned to an ambient temperature of . Each weapon will be individually tested, from an ammunition lot that produces a minimum corrected mean chamber pressure. The corrected proof pressure requirement (service pressure (Pmax) + 25%) for the 5.56\u00d745mm NATO like the STANAG 4172 is (PE) piezo pressure. This pressure has to be recorded in a NATO-design EPVAT barrel with Kistler 6215 transducer, HPI GP6 Transducer or by equipment to C.I.P. requirements.\nThe US SAAMI lists maximum average pressure (MAP) for the .223 Remington cartridge as piezo pressure with deviation of up to .\nRifle barrel configurations.\nWhen 5.56\u00d745mm NATO was adopted as standard in 1980, NATO chose a 178\u00a0mm (1:7) rifling twist rate for the 5.56\u00d745mm NATO chambering to adequately stabilize the relatively long NATO L110/M856 5.56\u00d745mm NATO tracer projectile. The US at that time converted all rifles in inventory by replacing the barrels and all new US military rifles since have been manufactured with this ratio.\nIn the US builders of AR type rifles can specify barrels with either .223 Remington, .223 Wylde, 223 Noveske, or 5.56\u00d745mm NATO chambers in lengths from pistol (7.5\") to long rifle (24\"). These barrels are also available with rifling ranging from 356\u00a0mm (1-in-14\") to 178\u00a0mm (1-in-7\"). US makers are moving toward 5.56\u00d745mm NATO and 178\u00a0mm (1-in-7\"), which will ensure the least liability. Those chambered for .223 Remington may not have a fast enough rifling to stabilize the longer 5.56\u00d745mm NATO bullets which range up to 77 gr. Some hunting loads of .223 Remington go to 90 grains.\nPerformance.\nThe 5.56\u00d745mm NATO SS109/M855 cartridge (NATO: SS109; U.S.: M855) with standard 62 gr. lead core bullets with steel penetrator will penetrate about into soft tissue in ideal circumstances. As with all spitzer shaped projectiles, it is prone to yaw in soft tissue. However, at impact velocities above roughly , it may yaw and then fragment at the cannelure (the crimping groove around the cylinder of the bullet). These fragments can disperse through flesh and bone, inflicting additional internal injuries.\nFragmentation, if and when it occurs, imparts much greater damage to human tissue than bullet dimensions and velocities would suggest. This fragmentation effect is highly dependent on velocity, and therefore barrel length: short-barreled carbines generate less muzzle velocity and therefore lose wounding effectiveness at much shorter ranges than longer-barreled rifles.\nProponents of the hydrostatic shock theory contend that the shockwave from a high-velocity bullet results in wounding effects beyond the tissue directly crushed and torn by the bullet and fragments. However, others argue that tissue damage from hydrostatic shock is a myth. Critics argue that sonic pressure waves do not cause tissue disruption and that temporary cavity formation is the actual cause of tissue disruption mistakenly attributed to sonic pressure waves.\nSS109/M855 NATO ball can penetrate up to of steel at 600 meters. According to Nammo, a Finnish-Norwegian ammunition producer, the 5.56\u00d745mm NATO M995 armour piercing cartridge can penetrate up to of RHA steel at 100 meters.\nThe US Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory measured a ballistic coefficient (G7 BC) of 0.151 and form factor (G7 \"i\") of 1.172 for the SS109/M855 ball projectile.\nThe Swedish military has measured the bullet velocities of SS109/M855 military cartridges at from the muzzle fired from differing barrel lengths.\nCriticism.\nThere has been much debate of the allegedly poor performance of the bullet on target in regard to stopping power, lethality, and range. Some of this criticism has been used to advocate an intermediate-sized cartridge between the 5.56 and 7.62 NATO sizes while criticisms of poor barrier penetration and accuracy have been used to support the M855A1 EPR round. Arguably, the criticisms about range, accuracy, and lethality are related to the change in barrel length and twist between the M16 and M4. The earlier 5.56 rounds (the original M193) were optimized for a barrel with a 1:12 twist. In 1980 STANAG 4172 defined the 5.56\u00d745mm NATO chambering and its accompanying 1:7 twist rifling. The shorter barrel of the M4 carbine (with a STANAG 4172 conform 1:7 twist and M855/SS109 5.56 rounds^) generates significantly lower muzzle velocity, reducing the likelihood that the bullet will upset (yaw, fragment, or expand) in the target and resulting in less significant wounds.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If 5.56\u00a0mm bullets fail to upset (yaw, fragment, or deform) within tissue, the results are less significant wounds that may not cause adequate blood loss or damage to immediately stop the target's attack or advances. This is true for some 5.56\u00d745mm FMJ bullets at extended ranges. As expected, with decreased wounding effects, rapid incapacitation is unlikely: enemy soldiers may continue to pose a threat to friendly forces and violent suspects can remain a danger to law enforcement personnel and the public.\n Two other yaw issues: Angle-of-Attack (AOA) variations between different projectiles, even within the same lot of ammo, as well as Fleet Yaw variations between different rifles, were elucidated in 2006 by the Joint Service Wound Ballistic Integrated Product Team (JSWB-IPT), which included experts from the military law enforcement user community, trauma surgeons, aero ballisticians, weapon and munitions engineers, and other scientific specialists. These yaw issues were most noticeable at close ranges and were more prevalent with certain calibers and bullet styles\u2014the most susceptible being 5.56\u00d745mm NATO FMJ ammunition like SS109/M855 and M193.\nThe 5.56\u00d745mm NATO standard SS109/M855 cartridge was designed for maximum performance when fired from a long barrel, as was the original 5.56\u00a0mm M193 cartridge. Experiments with longer length barrels up to resulted in no improvement or a decrease in muzzle velocities for the SS109/M855 cartridge. Shorter barrels produce a greater flash and noise signature, and the addition of a suppressor to a short barreled AR family rifle can make it unreliable, as the reduced time for the propellant to burn in the barrel and higher muzzle pressure levels at the suppressor entrance can cause faster cycling and feeding issues. Unless the gas port can be regulated or adjusted for higher pressures, suppressors for short barreled 5.56\u00d745mm NATO firearms must be larger and heavier than models for standard length rifles to function reliably. SS109/M855 cartridges fired from barrels under about in length do not have enough muzzle velocity energy to cause extreme damage that occurs only at terminal velocities of over on impact, reducing the wounding capacity.\nCompared to larger calibers, proponents of the 5.56\u00d745mm NATO round contend that animal studies of the wounding effects of the 5.56\u00d745mm NATO round versus the 7.62\u00d739mm have found that the 5.56\u00d745mm NATO round is more damaging, due to the post-impact behavior of the 5.56\u00a0mm projectile resulting in greater cavitation of soft tissues. The US Army contended in 2003 that the lack of close range lethality of the 5.56\u00d745mm NATO was more a matter of perception than fact. With controlled pairs and good shot placement to the head and chest, the target was usually defeated without issue. The majority of failures were the result of hitting the target in non-vital areas such as extremities. However, a minority of failures occurred in spite of multiple hits to the chest.\nSome have contended that shot placement is the most important parameter in determining the lethality of a bullet. Difficulty with the 5.56\u00d745mm NATO at long ranges has been attributed to training; Swedish ISAF units relied on .50 BMG heavy machine guns for long-range shooting due to resilience to factors such as range and wind drift. Underperformance is thus attributed to errors in range and wind estimation, target lead, firing position, and stress under fire, factors that can be resolved through training.\nImprovements.\nAdvances have been made in 5.56\u00a0mm ammunition. The U.S. military had adopted for limited issue a 77-grain (5.0 g) \"Match\" bullet, type classified as the Mk 262. The heavy, lightly constructed bullet fragments more violently at short range and also has a longer fragmentation range. Originally designed for use in the Mk 12 SPR, the ammunition has found favor with special forces units who were seeking a more effective cartridge to fire from their M4A1 carbines. Commercially available loadings using these heavier (and longer) bullets can be prohibitively expensive and cost much more than military surplus ammunition. Additionally, these heavy-for-caliber loadings sacrifice some penetrative ability compared to the M855 round (which has a steel penetrator tip). Performance of 5.56\u00d745mm military ammunition can generally be categorized as almost entirely dependent upon velocity in order to wound effectively. Heavy OTM bullets enhance soft tissue wounding ability at the expense of hard-target/barrier penetration.\nU.S. Special Forces had sought to create a round that had increased power out of carbine M4 barrels and compact SCAR-L barrels, while increasing hard target performance. Developmental efforts led to the creation of the Mk318. The bullet uses an open-tip design to inflict damage on soft tissue, and has a brass rear to penetrate hard targets. The tip and lead core fragments consistently even when using short barrels, while the rear moves through once the front impacts. It has more consistent performance because it is not yaw-dependent like the M855; the nose fragments upon impact and solid rear penetrator continues to move relatively straight. This makes the Mk318 effective against personnel with or without body armor. The round also increases accuracy, from 3\u20135 minute of angle (MOA) with the M855 from an M4A1 barrel to 1.71 MOA at 300 yards and 1.67 MOA at 600 yards from a SCAR-L barrel.\nFor general issue, the U.S. Army adopted the M855A1 round in 2010 to replace the M855. The primary reason was pressure to use non-lead bullets. The lead slug is replaced by a copper alloy slug in a reverse-drawn jacket, with a hardened steel penetrator extending beyond the jacket, reducing lead contamination to the environment. The M855A1 offers several improvements other than being lead-free. It is slightly more accurate, has better consistency of effect in regards to wounding ability, and has an increased penetrating capability. The 62 grain (4.0 g) projectile can better penetrate steel, brick, concrete, and masonry walls, as well as body armor and sheet metal. It penetrates of mild steel at 350 meters, which the M855 can only do at 160 meters. The propellant burns faster, which decreases the muzzle flash and gives a higher muzzle velocity, an important feature when fired from a short barreled M4 carbine. Though the M855A1 is more expensive to produce, its performance is considered to compensate. One possible danger is that it generates much greater pressure in the chamber when fired, decreasing service life of parts and increasing the risk of catastrophic failure of the weapon (though this has yet to occur).\nThe U.S. Marines adopted the Mk318 in early 2010 due to delays with the M855A1. This was a temporary measure until the M855A1 was available for them, which occurred in mid-2010 when the Army began to receive the rounds. Both the Mk318 and M855A1 weigh the same and have similar performance, and both have better performance than the M855 against all targets. SOCOM spent less money developing the Mk318 and it is marginally better than the M855A1 in some situations, but costs more per round. The Army spent more developing the M855A1 which performs as well or nearly as well as the Mk318, but is cheaper per round and has the advantage of being lead-free. While SOCOM constantly looks for better equipment, the Army and Marines have far more troops to supply and buy more ammunition than SOCOM.\nAlternatives.\nIf the 5.56\u00a0mm bullet is moving too slowly to reliably yaw, expand, or fragment on impact, the wound size and potential to incapacitate a person is greatly reduced. There have been numerous attempts to create an intermediate cartridge that addresses the complaints of 5.56 NATO's lack of stopping power along with lack of controllability seen in rifles firing 7.62 NATO in full auto. Some alternative cartridges like the 300 AAC Blackout (7.62\u00d735mm) focus on penetration and stopping power at short ranges by sacrificing long-distance performance. These calibers are designed to be interoperable with the 5.56 by maintaining similar dimensions, which allows them to be used in a 5.56-chambered rifle with a simple barrel change.\nBy late 2004, the 6.8mm Remington SPC (6.8\u00d743mm) was in limited use with U.S. Special Operators.However, it was not adopted for widespread use due to resistance from officials on changing calibers. In 2007, both the U.S. SOCOM and the U.S. Marine Corps decided not to field weapons chambered in 6.8\u00d743mm due to logistical and cost issues.\nIn April 2022, the U.S. Army selected a new rifle and light machine gun as part of the Next Generation Squad Weapon Program. They will replace 5.56\u00a0mm weapons, being chambered in 6.8\u00d751mm Fury that has greater accuracy and range while being more lethal than 5.56\u00d745mm NATO and 7.62\u00d751mm NATO against emerging threats.\n5.56mm NATO versus .223 Remington.\nThe exterior dimensions of the 5.56mm NATO and .223 Remington cartridges are identical. While the cartridges are identical other than powder load, the chamber leade, i.e. the area where the rifling begins, is cut to a sharper angle on some .223 commercial chambers. Because of this, a cartridge loaded to generate 5.56mm pressures in a 5.56mm chamber may develop pressures that exceed SAAMI limits when fired from a short-leade .223 Remington chamber. As the chambers differ, the head space gauges used for the two chamberings differ.\nBrass case.\nThe dimensional specifications of 5.56 NATO and .223 commercial brass cases are identical. The cases tend to have similar case capacity when measured, with variations chiefly due to brand, not 5.56 vs .223 designation. The result of this is that there is no such thing as \"5.56 brass\" or \".223 brass\", the differences in the cartridges lie in pressure ratings and in chamber leade length, not in the shape or thickness of the brass.\nIn July 2012, the US Army made a request for vendors to supply alternative cartridge cases to reduce the weight of an M855A1 5.56\u00a0mm round by at least 10 percent, as well as for the 7.62 NATO and .50 BMG rounds. The cartridge cases must maintain all performance requirements when fully assembled, be able to be used by the Lake City Army Ammunition Plant, must be manufactured in quantities totaling approximately 45 million per year. Polymer-cased ammunition is expected as a likely lightweight case technology. A hybrid polymer/metal version of a conventional cartridge case would be thicker than regular cases and reduce the amount of space for the propellant, although certain polymers could be thermodynamically more efficient and not lose energy to the case or chamber when fired.\nPressure.\nThe pressure limits for .223 Rem and 5.56\u00d745mm NATO are very similar if using similar measurement methodologies. Chamber pressures obtained using different methods are not comparable.\nChamber.\nThe 5.56mm NATO chamber, known as a NATO or mil-spec chamber, has a longer leade, which is the distance between the mouth of the cartridge and the point at which the rifling engages the bullet. The .223 Remington chamber, known as SAAMI chamber, is allowed to have a shorter leade, and is only required to be proof tested to the lower SAAMI chamber pressure. To address these issues, various proprietary chambers exist, such as the Wylde chamber (Rock River Arms) or the ArmaLite chamber, which are designed to handle both 5.56\u00d745mm NATO and .223 Remington equally well. The leade of the .223 Remington minimum C.I.P. chamber also differs from the 5.56mm NATO chamber specification. The casings and chambers .223 Remington and 5.56\u00d745mm NATO are virtually the same dimensions, but due to the fact that .223 Remington is designed to handle much lower pressures than the 5.56\u00d745mm NATO the rounds are not completely interchangeable. Firing a 5.56\u00d745mm NATO round out of a rifle chambered in .223 Remington could be injurious or fatal to the user as well as the gun, however .223 Remington ammunition can be fired safely from almost any rifle chambered in 5.56\u00d745mm NATO as the NATO specified rifles can handle much higher chamber pressures than the .223 Remington is capable of producing.\nUsing commercial .223 Remington cartridges in a 5.56mm NATO chambered rifle should work reliably, but until recently, it was believed this was less accurate than when fired from a .223 Remington chambered gun due to the longer leade. Although that may have been true in the early 1960s when the two rounds were developed, recent testing has shown that rifles chambered in 5.56\u00d745mm NATO can also fire .223 ammunition every bit as accurately as rifles chambered in .223 Remington, and the 5.56\u00d745mm NATO chamber has the additional advantage of being able to safely fire both calibers.\nUsing 5.56\u00d745mm NATO mil-spec cartridges (such as the M855) in a .223 Remington chambered rifle can lead to excessive wear and stress on the rifle and even be unsafe, and SAAMI recommends against the practice. (More recent tests have failed to find any \"dangerous pressure spike\" when firing military ammunition in a .223 chamber.) Some commercial rifles marked as \".223 Remington\" are in fact suited for 5.56\u00d745mm NATO, such as many commercial AR-15 variants and the Ruger Mini-14 (marked \".223 cal\", except the Mini-14 \"Target\" model, which only fires .223), but the manufacturer should always be consulted to verify that this is acceptable before attempting it, and signs of excessive pressure (such as flattening or gas staining of the primers) should be looked for in the initial testing with 5.56\u00d745mm NATO ammunition.\nThe upper receiver (to which the barrel with its chamber are attached) and the lower receiver are entirely separate parts in AR-15 style rifles. If the lower receiver has either .223 or 5.56 stamped on it, it does not guarantee the upper assembly is rated for the same caliber, because the upper and the lower receiver in the same rifle can, and frequently do, come from different manufacturers \u2013 particularly with rifles sold to civilians or second-hand rifles that have been repaired with spare parts. Since all parts are interchangeable, a shooter \"must\" take great caution to check for markings of 5.56\u00d745mm on the barrel before attempting to fire 5.56\u00d745mm NATO ammunition out of it.\nIn more practical terms, as of 2010[ [update]] most AR-15 parts suppliers engineer their complete upper assemblies (not to be confused with stripped uppers where the barrel is not included) to support both calibers in order to satisfy market demand and prevent any potential problems. Some manufacturers have begun offering a hybrid .223 Wylde chamber designed to optimally support both cartridges.\nAmmunition capacity for weight comparison.\nThe first confrontations between the 7.62\u00d739mm chambered AK-47 and the 7.62\u00d751mm NATO cartridge M14 rifle came in the early part of the Vietnam War. Battlefield reports indicated that the M14 was uncontrollable in full-auto and that soldiers could not carry enough ammo to maintain fire superiority over the AK-47. A replacement was needed, as a result, the Army was forced to reconsider a 1957 request by General Willard G. Wyman, commander of the U.S. Continental Army Command (CONARC) to develop a .223 caliber (5.56\u00a0mm) select-fire rifle weighing 6\u00a0lbs (2.7\u00a0kg) when loaded with a 20-round magazine.\nThis request ultimately resulted in the development of a scaled-down version of the Armalite AR-10, called ArmaLite AR-15 rifle. During testing it was found that a 5- to 7-man team armed with ArmaLite AR-15s had the same firepower as an 11-man team armed with M14s. Also, soldiers armed with ArmaLite AR-15s could carry nearly three times more ammunition as those armed with M14s (649 rounds vs 220 rounds). The ArmaLite AR-15, officially designated \"Rifle, caliber 5.56\u00a0mm, M16\", was later adopted by U.S. infantry forces as the standard-issue rifle.\nThe following table compares the maximum ammunition load a fire team can carry to support five similar rifles (measured in box magazines of ):\n5.56mm NATO versus 7.62mm NATO.\nHit probability refers to the ability of a soldier to concentrate on firing in spite of their weapon's recoil and noise, which is noticeably different between the two cartridges. The 7.62 NATO has twice the impact energy of the 5.56 NATO, preferable if a target is protected by higher level armor, especially at \"medium\" range. If not, both rounds normally penetrate satisfactorily through enemies up to 600 meters, approximately. A 5.56 NATO round fired from a barrel has a flatter trajectory than a 7.62 NATO round fired from a barrel of equal length, while the 5.56 NATO fired from a barrel has the same trajectory as the 7.62 NATO from a 20 in barrel, as well as the same time of flight. A 7.62 NATO round reaches 50 percent of its velocity within of the barrel when fired, so decreasing the barrel length for close quarters combat results in increased muzzle pressure and greater noise and muzzle flash.\nMilitary cartridges.\nAustralia.\nPackaging configurations for M2A1-type ammunition boxes include 1,080 loose rounds, 900 rounds divided across eighteen plastic film packs containing fifty rounds each, 600 rounds in bandoliers containing 15-round charger clips, and 800 linked rounds divided across four 200-round belts each which can contain either a single ammunition nature or a mix of ammunition natures (e.g. four ball rounds followed by one tracer round).\nUnless stated otherwise, all ammunition listed below is produced by Thales Australia. Since 2012, Thales Australia's ammunition production has been conducted via its Australian Munitions subsidiary.\nFrance.\nAmmunition made by GIAT.\nSouth Africa.\nPackaging configurations for all ammunition natures c.\u20092010 consisted of a plastic 8217 box containing 2,700 rounds divided across nine PVC bags of ten thirty-round cartons each and a conventional M2A1 box containing 800 rounds divided across forty twenty-round cartons each. For linked ammunition, configurations consisted of a plastic 7716 box containing 2,000 linked rounds divided across five plastic 7815 cases of two 200-round belts each and a conventional M2A1 box containing 800 linked rounds divided across four 200-round belts each.\nUnless stated otherwise, all ammunition listed was or is produced by Pretoria Metal Pressings, which became a division of Denel upon the latter's formation in 1992.\nUnited Kingdom.\nMilitary ammunition is generally provided in H83 ammunition boxes containing 800 or 900 rounds, with these containing either cardboard cartons of twenty rounds each, cardboard cartons of thirty rounds each (900-round H83s only), or nylon bandoliers with five pockets containing three ten-round charger clips each for a total of 150 rounds per bandolier (900-round H83s only). In addition to these H83 configurations, blank rounds can come in wire-bound wooden boxes containing 1,000 rounds in twenty-round cartons. Linked ammunition is supplied in H83 boxes that contain belts of the desired quantity and link configuration (e.g. a 800-round box consisting of belts arranged in a sequence of four ball rounds followed by one tracer round).\nUnited States.\nMilitary ammunition was packed exclusively in 20-round cartons from 1963 to 1966. In late 1966, the 10-round stripper clip and magazine-charging adapter were introduced and ammunition began being packed in clips in bandoleers. Typical packaging configurations for M2A1-type ammunition boxes include 840 rounds of ball ammunition in ten-round stripper clips, 1,140 rounds of blank ammunition in cartons, and 800 linked rounds irrespective of ammunition natures. Typical wire-bound wooden box capacities include 1,680 rounds and 1,600 rounds.\nSS109/M855.\nIn 1970, NATO decided to standardize a second rifle caliber. Tests were conducted from 1977 to 1980 using U.S. XM777 5.56\u00a0mm, Belgian SS109 5.56\u00a0mm, British 4.85\u00d749mm, and German 4.7\u00d733mm caseless. No weapon could be agreed upon, as many were prototypes, but the SS109 was found to be the best round and standardized on 28 October 1980. The SS109 was developed in the 1970s for the FN FNC rifle and the FN Minimi machine gun. To increase the range of the Minimi, the round was created to penetrate 3.5\u00a0mm of steel at 600 meters. The SS109 had a steel tip and lead rear and was not required to penetrate body armor. Barrels required at least a 1:9\u00a0in rifle twist, but needed a 1:7\u00a0in rifle twist to fire tracer ammunition. The U.S. designated the SS109 cartridge the M855 and first used it in the M16A2 rifle. The round was heavier than the previous M193. While the M855 had better armor penetrating ability, it is less likely to fragment after hitting a soft target. This lessens kinetic energy transfer to the target and reduces wounding capability. The M855 is yaw dependent, meaning it depends on the angle upon which it hits the target. If at a good angle, the round turns as it enters soft tissue, breaking apart and transferring its energy to what it hits. If impacting at a bad angle, it could pass through and fail to transfer its full energy. The SS109 was made to pierce steel helmets at long range from the Minimi, not improve terminal performance on soft tissue from rifles or carbines. In Iraq, troops that engaged insurgents at less than found that M855 rounds did not provide enough stopping power. In addition to not causing lethal effects with two or more rounds, they did not effectively penetrate vehicle windshields, even with many rounds fired at extremely close range. In Afghanistan, troops found that M855 rounds also suffered at long ranges. Although 5.56\u00a0mm rifles have an effective range of 450\u2013600 meters, the M855 bullet's performance falls off sharply beyond 300 meters. The ranges are even shorter for short-barreled carbines. Half of small-arms attacks were launched from 300 to 900 meter ranges. An M855 fired from an M4 carbine has severely degraded performance beyond 150 meters.\nThe maximum effective point target range of an M4 carbine with M855 rounds is , with a maximum effective area target range of . These mark the greatest distances the rounds can be expected to accurately hit the target, not the ranges that they have terminal effectiveness against them. Because the M855 is yaw dependent it requires instability in flight to deform upon hitting the target. It is the most stable in flight between , potentially lessening its effectiveness if it strikes an enemy between those distances. In addition to this, tests have shown that 5.56\u00a0mm bullets fragment most reliably when traveling faster than . From full-length rifle and machine gun barrels, rounds exhibit velocities above out to . An M855 fired from a shorter barreled M4 carbine exhibits a bullet velocity of at range. Even if it impacts at optimum speeds, 70 percent of 5.56\u00a0mm bullets will not begin to yaw until of tissue penetration. 15 percent more begin to yaw after that distance, so up to 85 percent of rounds that hit do not start to fragment until nearly 5\u00a0in of penetration. Against small statured or thin combatants, the M855 has little chance of yawing before passing through cleanly and leaving a wound cavity no bigger than the bullet itself. The factors of impact angle and velocity, instability distance, and penetration before yaw reduce the round's predictable effectiveness considerably in combat situations.\nM855A1.\nThe M855A1 Enhanced Performance Round (EPR) was introduced in June 2010. It features a lead-free projectile with a solid copper core, and is tailored for use in rifles with shorter barrels such as the M4 carbine. It provides more consistent performance compared to the M855.\nDeployment.\nOn 24 June 2010, the United States Army announced it began shipping its new 5.56\u00a0mm cartridge, the M855A1 Enhanced Performance Round (EPR), to active combat zones. During testing, the M855A1 performed better than M80 7.62\u00d751mm NATO ball ammunition against certain types of targets (particularly hardened steel). However, this was due to the addition of the steel penetrator to the M855A1 projectile compared to the standard lead-alloy core of the M80 projectile and is not an accurate comparison between the two cartridges. The US Army Picatinny Arsenal stated that the new M855A1 offers improved hard target capability, more consistent performance at all distances, enhanced dependability, improved accuracy, reduced muzzle flash, and higher velocity compared to the SS109/M855 round. Further, the Army stated the new M855A1 ammunition is tailored for use in M4 carbines, but should also give enhanced performance in M16 rifles and M249 light machine guns. The new projectile used in the M855A1 round has a copper core with a steel \"stacked-cone\" penetrating tip. The M855A1 cartridge is sometimes referred to as \"green ammo\" because it fires a lead free projectile. It is not necessarily more lethal than the SS109/M855, but performs more consistently every time it hits a soft target and retains its performance at longer distances. The EPR can penetrate a thick mild steel barrier from an M4 at and from an M16 at . Compared to the SS109/M855 the M855A1 muzzle velocities are somewhat increased to (+) for the M16 and (+) for the M4 carbine. Ballistics for both rounds are similar and do not require weapons to be re-zeroed, but if they are the EPR can be slightly more accurate. The steel-tip penetrator of the M855A1 is noticeably separated from the jacket of the bullet and can spin, but this is part of the design and does not affect performance. The M855A1 costs only 5 cents more per round than the M855. The M855A1 bullet has a greater length than the SS109/M855. Because steel and copper are less dense than lead, the bullet is lengthened inside the case to achieve the same weight as its predecessor. The longer bullet and reverse-drawn jacket make it more stable and accurate in-flight. Its steel tip is exposed from the jacket and bronzed for corrosion resistance. The tip is serrated and larger than the M855's steel tip. The M855A1's bullet composition, better aerodynamics, and higher proof pressures give it an extended effective range for penetration and terminal performance. While effectiveness at different ranges is increased, the M855A1 does not increase the effective ranges at which weapons are expected to hit their targets. The Enhanced Performance Round was made to nearly match the trajectory of the M855 to aid in training consistency\u2014the SS109/M855 ballistic coefficient (G7 BC) of 0.151 was improved to 0.152 for the M855A1\u2014but the ranges to get desired effects are greatly extended.\nThe United States Marine Corps purchased 1.8 million rounds in 2010, with plans to adopt the round to replace the interim MK318 SOST rounds used in Afghanistan when the M855A1 project was delayed. The Marine Corps plans to adopt the M855A1 round in 2018; although testing revealed it caused \"some durability issues\" with the Marines' M27 Infantry Automatic Rifle, the weapon is still \"operationally suitable\" when firing the round.\nOn a media day at Aberdeen Proving Ground on 4 May 2011, reports were given about the M855A1's performance in the field since it was issued 11 months earlier. One primary advantage given by the round is its consistent performance against soft targets. While the older SS109/M855 was yaw-dependent, which means its effectiveness depends on its yaw angle when it hits a target, the M855A1 delivers the same effectiveness in a soft target no matter its yaw angle. The new SMP-842 propellant in the round burns quicker in the shorter M4 carbine barrel, ensuring less muzzle flash and greater muzzle velocity. The M855A1 was able to penetrate of mild steel plate at . The round even penetrated concrete masonry units, similar to cinder blocks, at from an M16 and at from an M4, which the M855 could not do at those ranges. Its accuracy is maintained and sometimes increased, as it was able to shoot a group better at . February 2011 was the first time the M855A1 was used more than the M855, and approximately 30 million M855A1 rounds have been fielded from June 2010 to May 2011.\nThe M855A1 was put to the test at the 2012 National Rifle Association's National High-Power Rifle Championship at Camp Perry, Ohio in August 2012. The shooter for the Army was Rob Harbison, a contractor supporting small caliber ammunition capability development at Fort Benning Georgia. This was a special event for the Project Manager for Maneuver Ammunition Systems and the Army's Maneuver Center of Excellence as it was an opportunity to showcase the capabilities of the Enhanced Performance Round. With an M16 loaded with M855A1 ammo, Harbison fired a perfect 200 points in the Coast Guard Trophy Match, which is 20 shots fired from the sitting position at 200 yards, finishing 17th out of 365 competitors. He also scored a perfect 100 on the final string of ten shots during the Air Force Cup Trophy Match, fired at 600 yards from the prone position, which is 10 shots in a row within the 12-inch, 10-point ring at 600 yards with combat ammunition. Harbison was happy with the performance of the EPR, with his scores showing that the Army's newest general purpose round is accurate enough to go toe-to-toe in the competition with the best ammo that can be bought or hand-loaded. Harbison even said, \"I don't think I could have scored any higher if I was using match-grade competition ammunition.\" The M855A1 was not fired from 1:7\u00a0in rifled barrels used in standard Army rifles, but special Army Marksmanship Unit (AMU) match-grade 1:8\u00a0in rifled barrels, which produce more accurate results when firing 62-grain rounds.\nFrom fielding in June 2010 to September 2012, Alliant Techsystems delivered over 350 million M855A1 Enhanced Performance Rounds.\nSince its introduction, the M855A1 has been criticized for its St. Mark's SMP842 (former WC842) ball propellant causing increased fouling of the gun barrel. Post-combat surveys have reported no issues with the EPR in combat. A series of tests found no significant difference in fouling between the old M855 and the M855A1. However, manufacturers have reported \"severe degradation\" to barrels of their rifles using the M855A1 in tests. The Army attributes pressure and wear issues with the M855A1 to problems with the primer, which they claim to have addressed with a newly designed primer. It uses a modified four-pronged primer anvil for more reliable powder ignition, with a stab crimp rather than a circumferential crimp to better withstand the new load's higher chamber pressure, increased from to . During Army carbine testing, the round caused \"accelerated bolt wear\" from higher chamber pressure and increased bore temperatures. Special Operator testing saw cracks appear on locking lugs and bolts at cam pin holes on average at 6,000 rounds, but sometimes as few as 3,000 rounds during intense automatic firing. Firing several thousand rounds with such high chamber pressures can lead to degraded accuracy over time as parts wear out; these effects can be mitigated through a round counter to keep track of part service life. Weapons with barrel lengths shorter than the M4 firing the M855A1 also experience 50 percent higher pressures than a full-length M16 rifle barrel, which can cause port erosion that can boost the automatic fire rate, increasing the likelihood of jams.\nFrom June 2010 to June 2013, issuing of the M855A1 Enhanced Performance Round removed 1,994 metric tons of lead from the waste stream. of lead are eliminated from each M855A1 projectile.\nAn independent 2024 study concludes the M855A1 chamber and port pressures were measured to be significantly over the relevant NATO standard \u2013 to which all 5.56\u00d745mm NATO arms are designed for \u2013 in M16 and M4 small arms, causing problems in these ammunition specific \"internal piston\" system and the M27 IAR \"external piston\" system small arms platforms.\nMk 262.\nThe Mk 262 is a match-quality round manufactured by Black Hills Ammunition made originally for the Special Purpose Rifle (SPR). It uses a Sierra MatchKing bullet that is more effective at longer ranges than the standard issue M855 round.\nIn 1999, SOCOM requested Black Hills Ammunition to develop ammunition for the Mk 12 SPR that SOCOM was designing. For the rifle to be accurate out to 700 yards, Black Hills \"militarized\" a cartridge that used the Sierra OTM (Open Tip Match) projectile; it switched from a .223 Remington to 5.56\u00a0mm case, increased pressure loading, crimped and sealed the primer, and added a flash retardant to the powder. The Mk 262 MOD 0 was adopted in 2002. Issues came up in development including reliability problems in different temperatures and when the weapon got dirty, and cycling issues in cold weather due to the slightly shorter barrel of the SPR compared to the full-length M16A2 barrel. The problems were addressed with a slower burning powder with a different pressure for use in the barrel, creating the Mk 262 MOD 1 in 2003. During the product improvement stage, the new propellant was found to be more sensitive to heat in weapon chambers during rapid firings, resulting in increased pressures and failure to extract. This was addressed with another powder blend with higher heat tolerance and improved brass. Also during the stage, Black Hills wanted the bullet to be given a cannelure, which had been previously rejected for fear it would affect accuracy. It was eventually added for effective crimping to ensure that the projectile would not move back into the case and cause a malfunction during auto-load feeding. Although the temperature sensitive powder and new bullet changed specifications, the designation remained as the MOD 1.\nAccording to US DoD sources, the Mk 262 round is capable of making kills at 700 meters. Ballistics tests found that the round caused \"consistent initial yaw in soft tissue\" between 3 and 4 in at ranges from 15 feet to 300 meters. Apparently it is superior to the standard M855 round when fired from an M4 or M16 rifle, increasing accuracy from 3\u20135 minutes of angle to 2 minute of angle. It possesses superior stopping power, and can allow for engagements to be extended to up to 700 meters when fired from an 18-inch barrel. It appears that this round can drastically improve the performance of any AR-15 weapon chambered to .223/5.56\u00a0mm. Superior accuracy, wounding capacity, stopping power and range have made this the preferred round of many special forces operators, and highly desirable as a replacement for the older, Belgian-designed 5.56\u00d745mm SS109/M855 NATO round. In one engagement, a two-man special forces team reported 75 kills with 77 rounds. The Mk 262 has a higher ballistic coefficient than the M855 of (G1)0.362 / (G7)0.181, meaning it loses less velocity at long-range.\nBlack Hills also produces the MK262 Mod-1C for sale in the US civilian market under Product Code D556N9.\nMk318.\nFollowing early engagements in Afghanistan and Iraq, U.S. Special Operations Forces reported that M855 ammunition used in M4A1 rifles was ineffective. In 2005, the Pentagon issued a formal request to the ammunition industry for \"enhanced\" ammunition. The only business that responded was the Federal Cartridge Company, owned by Alliant Techsystems. Working with the Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division, the team created performance objectives for the new ammo: increased consistency from shot to shot regardless of temperature changes, accuracy out of an M4A1 better than 2 minute of angle (2 inches at 100 yards, 6.3 inches at 300 yards), increased stopping power after passing through \"intermediate barriers\" like walls and car windshields, increased performance and decreased muzzle flash out of shorter barrel FN SCAR rifles, and costs close to the M855. The first prototypes were delivered to the government in August 2007. Increased velocity and decreased muzzle flash were accomplished by the type of powder used. The design of the bullet was called the Open Tip Match Rear Penetrator (OTMRP). The front of it is an open tip backed up by a lead core, while the rear half is solid brass. When the bullet hits a hard barrier, the front half of the bullet crushes against the barrier, breaking it so the penetrating half of the bullet can go through and hit the target. With the lead section penetrating the target and the brass section following, it was referred to as a \"barrier blind\" bullet.\nOfficially designated the Mk318 MOD 0 \"Cartridge, Caliber 5.56mm Ball, Carbine, Barrier\", and called \"SOST (Special Operations Science and Technology)\" ammunition, the bullet fragments consistently, even out of a 10.5\u00a0in barrel. The lead portion fragments in the first few inches of soft tissue, then the solid copper rear penetrates 18 in of tissue (shown though ballistic gelatin) while tumbling. Out of a 14\u00a0in barrel, the Mk318 has a muzzle velocity of .\nIn February 2010, the U.S. Marine Corps adopted the Mk318 for use by infantry. To be fielded by an entire branch of the military, the round is classified as having an \"open-tip\" bullet, similar to the M118LR 7.62 NATO round. The SOST bullet uses a \"reverse drawn\" forming process. The base of the bullet is made first, the lead core is placed on top of it, and then the jacketing is pulled up around the lead core from bottom to tip. Conventional, and cheaper, bullets are made with the method of the jacket drawn from the nose to an exposed lead base. The reverse drawn technique leaves an open tip as a byproduct of the manufacturing process, and is not specifically designed for expansion or to affect terminal ballistics. The Pentagon legally cleared the rounds for Marine use in late January. The Marines fielded the Mk318 gradually and in small numbers. Initial studies showed that insurgents hit by it suffered larger exit wounds, although information was limited. SOST rounds were used alongside M855 rounds in situations where the SOST would be more effective. In July 2010, the Marines purchased 1.8 million M855A1 Enhanced Performance Rounds, in addition to millions of Mk318 rounds in service, as part of its effort to replace its M855 ammo. As of May 2015, Marine combat units still deployed with a mixture of both SOST and M855 rounds.\nAs the issue of environmentally friendly ammo grew, the Marines looked to see if the Mk318's lead could be replaced while still meeting specifications. They found that by replacing the lead with copper and slightly stretching the jacket around to crimp the nose even more, the bullet's ballistic coefficient increased. To avoid visual confusion with the Mk 262 round, the bullet was entirely nickel-plated for a silver color; the enhanced silver-colored copper jacketed, open tip match, 62-grain projectile was named the Mk318 MOD 1.\n5.6mm 90.\nThe 5.6mm 90 or 5,6mm Gw Pat 90 (5.6\u00a0mm Rifle Cartridge 90), is the standard round used by the Swiss military in its rifle, the SIG SG 550. The cartridge is also known as the Cart 5,6mm 90 F ( / ) to the French- and Italian-speaking Swiss militiamen. The Swiss refer to the round as the 5.6\u00a0mm Gw Pat 90, although it is interchangeable with the 5.56\u00d745mm NATO and .223 Remington round. The Gw Pat 90 round firing a FMJ bullet is optimized for use in 5.56\u00a0mm (.223 in) caliber barrels with a 254\u00a0mm (1:10\u00a0in) twist rate.\nThe Gw Pat 90 was designed for the SIG SG 550 when it came into production in 1987, replacing the SIG SG 510. Previous experience of a change in standard rifle had proved that changing the distance of fire for the training ranges was more expensive than the design of a new ammunition; this prompted the design of a cartridge nominally capable at 300 meters. The cartridge was also designed to reduce pollution by controlling lead emissions. The bullet was originally clad with a nickel alloy jacket; however, this was found to cause excessive barrel wear, so in 1998 the nickel jackets were replaced with tombac jackets. In addition, in 1999 a copper plug was added to the base of the bullet to address environmental concerns.\n the ammunition was produced by RUAG Ammotec, a subsidiary of the RUAG group. It is manufactured in three variations: the standard FMJ round, the tracer round, and a blank round.\nThe FMJ cartridge has a copper-zinc alloy case and uses a double base propellant. The bullet is a tombac jacketed FMJ projectile with a G1 ballistic coefficient of 0.331 (ICAO) / 0.337 (Army Metro). The projectile contains approximately 95% lead, 2% tin, 3% copper, and was designed for terminal ballistic instability. The required accuracy for Gw Pat 90 ammunition out of factory test barrels is 63\u00a0mm (0.72\u00a0MOA) for 10 rounds (100% radius measurement method) out to 300\u00a0m. The Gw Pat 90 cartridge dimensions are in accordance with the civilian C.I.P. standards for the .223 Remington C.I.P. chambering.\nThe Gw Pat 90 is used both in the Swiss military and in sport shooting. The very high level of individual training in the Swiss militia (every single soldier bearing a weapon has to shoot in order to maintain his ability once a year; see Gun laws in Switzerland) and the overall use of the Gw Pat 90 by the many Swiss citizens who shoot in competitions and for amusement has resulted in significant input on its usage. Over 1 billion cartridges had been produced as of 2005[ [update]].\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Debuting in 1968, the program was created by Don Hewitt and Bill Leonard, who distinguished it from other news programs by using a unique style of reporter-centered investigation. In 2002, \"60 Minutes\" was ranked number six on \"TV Guide\"'s list of the \"50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time\", and in 2013, it was ranked number 24 on the magazine's list of the \"60 Best Series of All Time\". In 2023, \"Variety\" ranked \"60 Minutes\" as the twentieth-greatest TV show of all time. \"The New York Times\" has called it \"one of the most esteemed news magazines on American television\".\nThe program began in 1968 as a bi-weekly television show hosted by Mike Wallace and Harry Reasoner. The two sat on opposite sides of the cream-colored set, though the set's color was later changed to black, the color still in use. The show used a large stopwatch during transition periods and highlighted its topics through chroma key\u2014both techniques are still used. In 1972, the program began airing from 6:00\u00a0p.m. to 7:00\u00a0p.m. Eastern time, although this time was sometimes disrupted by broadcasting of NFL games on Sundays. Since then, the show has generally kept the Sunday evening format, although the start time has occasionally been shifted. The program generally starts at 7:00\u00a0p.m. Eastern. If sports programming is airing that afternoon, \"60 Minutes\" starts at 7:30\u00a0p.m. Eastern or at the game's conclusion.\nThe show is hosted by correspondents who do not share screen time with each other. Full-time hosts include Lesley Stahl, Scott Pelley, and Bill Whitaker. Several spinoffs have been made, including international formats of the show.\nBroadcast history.\nEarly years.\nThe program employed a magazine format similar to that of the Canadian program \"W5\", which had premiered two years earlier. It pioneered many of the most important investigative journalism procedures and techniques, including re-editing interviews, hidden cameras, and \"gotcha journalism\" visits to the home or office of an investigative subject. Similar programs sprang up in Australia and Canada during the 1970s, as well as on local television news.\nInitially, \"60 Minutes\" aired as a bi-weekly show hosted by Mike Wallace and Harry Reasoner debuting on September 24th, 1968, and alternating weeks with other CBS News productions on Tuesday evenings at 10:00\u00a0p.m. Eastern Time. The first edition, described by Reasoner in the opening as a \"kind of a magazine for television,\" featured the following segments:\nThe first \"magazine-cover\" chroma key was a photo of two helmeted policemen (for the Clark interview segment). Wallace and Reasoner sat in chairs on opposite sides of the set, which had a cream-colored backdrop; the more famous black backdrop (which is still used as of 2020[ [update]]) did not appear until the following year. The logo was in Helvetica type with the word \"Minutes\" spelled in all lower-case letters; the logo most associated with the show (rendered in Eurostile type with \"Minutes\" spelled in uppercase) did not appear until about 1974. Further, to extend the magazine motif, the producers added a \"Vol. xx, No. xx\" to the title display on the chroma key; modeled after the volume and issue number identifications featured in print magazines, this was used until about 1971. The trademark stopwatch, however, did not appear on the inaugural broadcast; it would not debut until several episodes later. Alpo dog food was the sole sponsor of the first program.\nDon Hewitt, who had been a producer of the \"CBS Evening News\" with Walter Cronkite, sought out Wallace as a stylistic contrast to Reasoner. According to one historian of the show, the idea of the format was to make the hosts the reporters, to always feature stories that were of national importance but focused upon individuals involved with, or in conflict with, those issues, and to limit the reports' airtime to around 13 minutes. However, the initial season was troubled by lack of network confidence, as the program did not garner ratings much higher than that of other CBS News documentaries. As a rule, during that era, news programming during prime time lost money; networks mainly scheduled public affairs programs in prime time in order to bolster the prestige of their news departments, and thus boost ratings for the regular evening newscasts, which were seen by far more people than documentaries and the like. \"60 Minutes\" struggled under that stigma during its first three years.\nChanges to \"60 Minutes\" came fairly early in the program's history. When Reasoner left CBS to co-anchor ABC's evening newscast (he would return to CBS and \"60 Minutes\" in 1978), Morley Safer joined the team in 1970, and he took over Reasoner's duties of reporting less aggressive stories. However, when Richard Nixon began targeting press access and reporting, even Safer, formerly the CBS News bureau chief in Saigon and London, began to do \"hard\" investigative reports, and during the 1970\u201371 season alone, \"60 Minutes\" reported on cluster bombs, the South Vietnamese Army, draft dodgers, Nigeria, the Middle East, and Northern Ireland.\nEffects from the Prime Time Access Rule and later years.\nBy 1971, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) introduced the Prime Time Access Rule, which freed local network affiliates in the top 50 markets (in practice, the entire network) to take a half-hour of prime time from the networks on Mondays through Saturdays and one full hour on Sundays. Because nearly all affiliates found production costs for the FCC's intended goal of increased public affairs programming very high and the ratings (and by association, advertising revenues) low, making it mostly unprofitable, the FCC created an exception for network-authored news and public affairs shows. After a six-month hiatus in late 1971, CBS found a prime place for \"60 Minutes\" in a portion of that displaced time, 6:00\u00a0p.m. to 7:00\u00a0p.m. Eastern (5:00\u00a0p.m. to 6:00\u00a0p.m. Central Time) on Sundays in January 1972.\nThis proved somewhat less than satisfactory, however, because in order to accommodate CBS telecasts of late afternoon National Football League (NFL) games, \"60 Minutes\" went on hiatus during the fall from 1972 to 1975 (and the summer of 1972). This took place because football telecasts were protected contractually from interruptions in the wake of the infamous \"Heidi Bowl\" incident on NBC in November 1968. Despite the irregular scheduling, the program's hard-hitting reports attracted a steadily growing audience, particularly during the waning days of the Vietnam War and the gripping events of the Watergate scandal; at that time, few if any other major network news shows did in-depth investigative reporting to the degree carried out by \"60 Minutes\". Eventually, during the summers of 1973 through 1975, CBS did allow the program back onto the prime time schedule proper, on Fridays in 1973 and Sundays the two years thereafter, as a replacement for programs aired during the regular television season.\nIt was only when the FCC returned an hour to the networks on Sundays (for news or family programming), which had been taken away from them four years earlier, in a 1975 amendment to the Access Rule, that CBS finally found a viable permanent timeslot for \"60 Minutes\". When the family-oriented drama \"Three for the Road\" ended after a 12-week run in the fall, the news magazine took its place at 7:00\u00a0p.m. Eastern Time (6:00\u00a0p.m. Central) on December 7, 1975, and has been aired at that time since then, making it not only the longest-running prime time program currently in production, but also the television program (excluding daily programs such as evening newscasts or morning news-talk shows) broadcasting for the longest length of time at a single time period each week in US television history.\nThis move, and the addition of then-White House correspondent Dan Rather to the reporting team, made the program into a strong ratings hit and, eventually, a general cultural phenomenon. This was no less than a stunning reversal of the historically poor ratings performances of documentary programs on network television. By 1976, \"60 Minutes\" became the top-rated program on Sunday nights in the US. By 1979, it had achieved the #1 spot among all television programs in the Nielsen ratings, unheard of before for a news broadcast in prime time. This success translated into great profits for CBS; advertising rates increased from $17,000 per 30-second spot in 1975 to $175,000 in 1982.\nThe program sometimes does not start until after 7:00\u00a0p.m. Eastern, due largely to CBS Sports live sporting events. At the conclusion of an NFL game, \"60 Minutes\" will air in its entirety and delay all subsequent programs. However, in the Pacific time zone, \"60 Minutes\" is always able to start at its scheduled time as live sports coverage ends earlier in the afternoon. The program's success has also led CBS Sports to schedule events (such as the final round of the Masters Tournament and the PGA Championship and the second round and regional final games of the NCAA men's basketball tournament) leading into \"60 Minutes\" and the rest of the network's primetime lineup for the night (as CBS never airs any sports programming on Sundays in primetime except for the AFC Divisional Round, AFC Championship Game, or the Super Bowl).\nStarting in the 2012\u20132013 season, in order to accommodate a new NFL scheduling policy that the second game of a doubleheader start at 4:25\u00a0p.m., CBS changed the scheduled start time of \"60 Minutes\" to 7:30\u00a0p.m. Eastern time (or game conclusion) for Eastern and Central Time Zone stations which are receiving a game in that window. The start time remains at 7:00\u00a0p.m. Eastern/Pacific (or game conclusion if a late single game is airing in the eastern markets) on stations which are not broadcasting a late game in a given week (or for Western time zones even if a doubleheader airs). Since the 2023\u20132024 season, the show began to have occasional 90-minute episodes.\nRadio broadcast and Internet distribution.\n\"60 Minutes\" is also simulcast on several former CBS Radio flagship stations. WBBM in Chicago, KRLD in Dallas, WWJ in Detroit, KNX in Los Angeles, KYW in Philadelphia, KCBS in San Francisco (all owned by Audacy) and\nWBZ in Boston (owned by iHeartMedia). Anchorage-based station KFQD airs \"60 Minutes\" as part of its affiliation with local CBS station KAUU. When it airs locally on their sister CBS Television Network affiliate, even in the Central and Eastern time zones, the show is aired at the top of the hour at 7:00\u00a0p.m./6:00\u00a0p.m. Central (barring local sports play-by-play pre-emptions and breaking news coverage) no matter how long the show is delayed on CBS Television, resulting in radio listeners often hearing the show on those stations ahead of the television broadcast. An audio version of each broadcast without advertising began to be distributed via podcast and the iTunes Store, starting with the broadcast on September 23, 2007. Video from \"60 Minutes\" (including full episodes) is also made available for streaming several hours after the program's initial broadcast on CBSNews.com and Paramount+.\nFormat.\n\"60 Minutes\" normally has three long-form news stories without superimposed graphics. There is a commercial break between two stories. Each story is introduced from a set with a backdrop resembling pages from a magazine story on the same topic. The program undertakes its own investigations and follows up on investigations instigated by national newspapers and other sources. Unlike its competitor \"20/20\", as well as traditional local and national news programs, the \"60 Minutes\" journalists never share the screen with (or speak to) other \"60 Minutes\" journalists on camera at \"any\" time. This creates a strong psychological sense of intimacy between the journalist and the television viewer.\nReporting tone.\n\"60 Minutes\" blends the journalism of the seminal 1950s CBS series \"See It Now\" with Edward R. Murrow (for which Hewitt served as director in its first years) and the personality profiles of another Murrow program, \"Person to Person\". In Hewitt's words, \"60 Minutes\" blends \"higher Murrow\" and \"lower Murrow\".\n\"Point/Counterpoint\" segment.\nFor most of the 1970s, the program included \"Point/Counterpoint\", in which a liberal and a conservative commentator debated an issue. This segment originally featured James J. Kilpatrick representing the conservative side and Nicholas von Hoffman for the liberal, with Shana Alexander taking over for von Hoffman after he departed in 1974. The segment was an innovation that caught the public imagination as a live version of competing editorials. In 1979, Alexander asked Hewitt to raise the $350 a week pay; Hewitt declined, and the segment ended.\n\"Point/Counterpoint\" was lampooned by the NBC comedy series \"Saturday Night Live\", which featured Jane Curtin and Dan Aykroyd as TV news reporters. Their segment featured a debate in comically complete abandonment of rhetorical decorum, with Aykroyd announcing the topic, Curtin making an opening statement, then Aykroyd typically retorting with ad hominem attacks, such as \"Jane, you ignorant slut\" and Curtin responding \"Dan, you pompous ass\"; in the film \"Airplane!\" (1980), in which the \"faux\" Kilpatrick argues in favor of the plane crashing, stating \"they bought their tickets, they knew what they were getting into\"; and in an earlier sketch comedy film, \"The Kentucky Fried Movie\", where the segment was called Count/Pointercount.\nA similar concept was revived briefly in March 2003 featuring Bob Dole and Bill Clinton, former opponents in the 1996 presidential election. The pair agreed to do ten segments (titled \"Clinton/Dole\" and \"Dole/Clinton\" in alternating weeks), but these did not continue into the 2003\u20132004 fall season. Reports indicated that the segments were considered too gentlemanly, in the style of the earlier \"Point/Counterpoint\", and lacked the feistiness of \"Crossfire\".\nAndy Rooney segment.\nFrom 1978 to 2011, the program usually ended with a (usually light-hearted and humorous) commentary by Andy Rooney expounding on topics of wildly varying import, ranging from international politics, to economics, and to personal philosophy on everyday life. One recurring topic was measuring the amount of coffee in coffee cans.\nRooney's pieces, particularly one in which he referred to actor Mel Gibson as a \"wacko\", on occasion led to complaints from viewers. In 1990, Rooney was suspended without pay for three months by then-CBS News President David Burke, because of the negative publicity around his saying that \"too much alcohol, too much food, drugs, homosexual unions, cigarettes [are] all known to lead to premature death.\" He wrote an explanatory letter to a gay organization after being ordered not to do so. After four weeks without Rooney, \"60 Minutes\" lost 20% of its audience. CBS management concluded that it was in their best interest to have Rooney return immediately.\nRooney published several books documenting his contributions to the program, including \"Years of Minutes\" and \"A Few Minutes with Andy Rooney\". Rooney retired from \"60 Minutes\", delivering his final commentary on October 2, 2011; it was his 1,097th commentary over his 34-year career on the program. He died one month later on November 4, 2011. On November 13, 2011, \"60 Minutes\" featured an hour-long tribute to Rooney and his career and included a rebroadcast of his final commentary segment.\nOpening sequence.\nThe opening sequence features a \"60 Minutes\" \"magazine cover\" with the show's trademark, an Aristo stopwatch, intercut with preview clips of the episode's stories. The sequence ends with each of the correspondents and hosts introducing themselves. The last host who appears (currently Scott Pelley) then says, \"Those stories tonight on \"60 Minutes\"\". When Rooney was a prominent fixture, the final line was \"Those stories and Andy Rooney, tonight on \"60 Minutes\"\". Before that, and whenever Rooney did not appear, the final line was \"Those stories and more, tonight on \"60 Minutes\"\".\nThe stopwatch counts off each of the broadcast's 60 minutes, starting from zero at the beginning of each show. It is seen during the opening title sequence, before each commercial break, and at the tail-end of the closing credits, and each time it appears it displays (within reasonable accuracy) the elapsed time of the episode to that point.\nOn October 29, 2006, the opening sequence changed from a black background, which had been used for over a decade, to white. Also, the gray background for the Aristo stopwatch in the \"cover\" changed to red, the color for the title text changed to white, and the stopwatch itself changed from the diagonal position it had been oriented in for 31 years to an upright position.\nWeb content.\nVideos and transcripts of \"60 Minutes\" editions, as well as clips that were not included in the broadcast are available on the program's website. In September 2010, the program launched a website called \"60 Minutes Overtime\", in which stories broadcast on-air are discussed in further detail. Previously the show had a partnership with Yahoo! for distribution of extra content.\nCorrespondents and hosts.\nCommentators.\nCommentators for \"60 Minutes\" have included:\nProducers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt; \nRatings and recognition.\nNielsen ratings.\nBased on viewership ratings, \"60 Minutes\" is the most successful program in American television history since it was moved into its present timeslot in 1975. For five seasons it was the year's top program, a feat matched by the sitcoms \"All in the Family\" and \"The Cosby Show\", and surpassed only by the reality competition series \"American Idol\", which had been the #1 show for eight consecutive seasons from the 2003\u20132004 television season up to the 2010\u20132011 season. \"60 Minutes\" was a top ten show for 23 seasons in a row (1977\u20132000), an unsurpassed record, and has made the Top 20 for every season since the 1976\u20131977 season, except from 2005 to 2008.\n\"60 Minutes\" first broke into the Nielsen Top 20 during the 1976\u201377 season. The following season, it was the fourth-most-watched program, and by the 1979\u201380 season, it was the number one show. During the 21st century, it remained among the top 20 programs in the Nielsen ratings, and the highest-rated news magazine.\nOn November 16, 2008, the edition featuring an interview with President-elect Barack Obama, earned a total viewership of 25.1 million viewers.\nOn October 6, 2013, the broadcast (which was delayed by 44 minutes that evening due to a Denver Broncos\u2013Dallas Cowboys NFL game) drew 17.94 million viewers; retaining 63% of the 28.32 million viewers of its lead-in, and making it the most watched \"60 Minutes\" broadcast since December 16, 2012.\nOn December 1, 2013, the broadcast (delayed 50 minutes due to a Broncos\u2013Kansas City Chiefs game) was watched by 18.09 million viewers, retaining 66% of its NFL lead-in (which earned 28.11 million viewers during the 7:00\u00a0p.m. hour).\nOn March 25, 2018, the edition featuring Stormy Daniels giving details on her alleged affair with President Donald Trump drew 22.1 million viewers, the most since the 2008 Obama interview. The broadcast was delayed due to the NCAA men's basketball regional final on CBS between Kansas and Duke going to overtime.\nRecognition.\nEmmy Awards.\nAs of June\u00a026, 2017[ [update]], \"60 Minutes\" had won a total of 138 Emmy Awards, a record for American primetime programs.\nPeabody Awards.\nThe program has won 20 Peabody Awards for segments including \"All in the Family\", an investigation into abuses by government and military contractors; \"The CIA's Cocaine\", which uncovered CIA involvement in drug smuggling, \"Friendly Fire\", a report on incidents of friendly fire in the Gulf War; \"The Duke Rape Case\", an investigation into accusations of rape at an off campus lacrosse team party in 2006; and \"The Killings in Haditha\", an investigation into the killing of Iraqi civilians by U.S. Marines.\nOther awards.\nThe show received an Investigative Reporter and Editor medal for their segment \"The Osprey\", documenting a Marine cover-up of deadly flaws in the V-22 Osprey aircraft.\nExoneration.\nIn 1983, a report by Morley Safer, \"Lenell Geter's in Jail\", helped exonerate a Texas man who was wrongly convicted and imprisoned for armed robbery.\nLongest-running primetime show.\nAs of 2021[ [update]], \"60 Minutes\" is the longest continuously running program of any genre scheduled during American network prime time. It has aired at 7:00\u00a0p.m. Eastern Time on Sundays since December 7, 1975 (although since 2012, it moves to 7:30\u00a0p.m. Eastern Time on Sundays if CBS has a late NFL game).\n\"Meet the Press\" debuted in 1947 in prime time, but it has been a daytime program since 1965. The Walt Disney anthology television series, which premiered in 1954, and the \"Hallmark Hall of Fame\", which has aired since 1951, have aired longer than \"60 Minutes\", but none of them has aired in prime time continually.\nControversies.\nThe show has been praised for landmark journalism and received many awards. However, it has also become embroiled in some controversy, including (in order of appearance):\nAudi unintended acceleration.\nOn November 23, 1986, \"60 Minutes\" aired a segment greenlit by Hewitt, concerning the Audi 5000 automobile, a popular German luxury car. The story covered a supposed problem of \"unintended acceleration\" when the brake pedal was pushed, with emotional interviews with six people who sued Audi (unsuccessfully) after they crashed their cars, including one woman whose six-year-old son had been killed. In the \"60 Minutes\" segment footage was shown of an Audi 5000 with the accelerator \"moving down on its own\", accelerating the car. It later emerged that an expert witness employed by one of the plaintiffs modified the accelerator with a concealed device, causing the \"unintended acceleration\". Independent investigators concluded that this \"unintended acceleration\" was most likely due to driver error, where the driver let their foot slip off the brake and onto the accelerator. Tests by Audi and independent journalists showed that even with the throttle wide open, the car would simply stall if the brakes were actually being used.\nThe incident devastated Audi sales in the United States, which did not rebound for 15 years. The initial incidents which prompted the report were found by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and Transport Canada to have been attributable to operator error, where car owners had depressed the accelerator pedal instead of the brake pedal. CBS issued a partial retraction, without acknowledging the test results of involved government agencies. Years later, \"Dateline NBC\", a rival to \"60 Minutes\", was found guilty of similar tactics regarding the fuel tank integrity of General Motors pickup trucks.\nJeep rollovers.\nA segment aired in December, 1980, concerning the alleged Jeep CJ-5 \"high rollover risk\" as demonstrated in Insurance Institute for Highway Safety testing. The demonstration was a Jeep rolling over during an extreme turn at 20\u00a0mph (32 km/h), something that would not cause other cars to roll over. It was deemed by \"60 Minutes\" reporters as the \"most dangerous thing on four wheels\". After the show aired, many people were concerned about the safety of the vehicle, and following sales plummeted. This tarnished the reputation of the Jeep CJ; the model was discontinued in 1986. Years after the incident occurred, it was found that the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety had attempted to roll the car 435 times, only having 8 rollovers. The show had also failed to mention/show that there were weights hanging on spots of the vehicle that had caused the vehicle to have a higher rollover risk.\nAlar.\nIn February 1989, \"60 Minutes\" aired a report by the Natural Resources Defense Council claiming that the use of daminozide (Alar) on apples presented an unacceptably high health risk to consumers. Apple sales dropped and CBS was sued unsuccessfully by apple growers. Alar was subsequently banned for use on food crops in the U.S. by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\nWerner Erhard.\nOn March 3, 1991, \"60 Minutes\" broadcast \"Werner Erhard,\" which dealt with controversies involving Erhard's personal and business life. A year after the \"60 Minutes\" piece aired, Erhard filed a lawsuit against CBS, claiming that the broadcast contained several \"false, misleading and defamatory\" statements about him. One month after filing the lawsuit, Erhard filed for dismissal. Erhard later told Larry King in an interview that he dropped the suit after receiving legal advice telling him that in order to win it, he had to prove not only that CBS knew the allegations were false but also that CBS acted with malice. After numerous independent journalists exposed untruths and factual inaccuracies in the story the segment was removed by CBS from its archives, with a disclaimer: \"This segment has been deleted at the request of CBS News for legal or copyright reasons.\"\nBrown &amp; Williamson.\nIn 1995, former Brown &amp; Williamson Vice President for Research and Development Jeffrey Wigand provided information to \"60 Minutes\" producer Lowell Bergman pertaining to B&amp;W having systematically hidden the health risks of their cigarettes &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;. Furthermore, it was alleged that B&amp;W had introduced foreign agents (such as fiberglass and ammonia) with the intent of enhancing the effect of nicotine. Bergman began to produce a piece based upon the information, but ran into opposition from Don Hewitt who, along with CBS lawyers, feared a billion-dollar lawsuit from Brown and Williamson for tortious interference for encouraging Wigand to violate his non-disclosure agreement. A number of people at CBS would benefit from a sale of CBS to Westinghouse Electric Corporation, including the head of CBS lawyers and CBS News. Also, because of the interview, the son of CBS President Laurence Tisch (who also controlled Lorillard Tobacco) was among the people from the big tobacco companies at risk of being caught having committed perjury. Due to Hewitt's hesitation, \"The Wall Street Journal\" instead broke Wigand's story. The \"60 Minutes\" piece was eventually aired with substantially altered content and minus some of the most damning evidence against B&amp;W. The expos\u00e9 of the incident was published in an article in \"Vanity Fair\" by Marie Brenner, entitled \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\".\n\"The New York Times\" wrote that \"the traditions of Edward R. Murrow and '60 Minutes' itself were diluted in the process,\" though the newspaper revised the quote slightly, suggesting that \"60 Minutes\" and CBS had \"betrayed the legacy of Edward R. Murrow\". The incident was turned into a seven-times Oscar-nominated feature film entitled \"The Insider\", directed by Michael Mann and starring Russell Crowe as Wigand, Al Pacino as Bergman, and Christopher Plummer as Mike Wallace. Wallace denounced the portrayal of him as inaccurate to his stance on the issue.\nU.S. Customs Service.\nIn 1997, \"60 Minutes\" alleged that agents of the U.S. Customs Service ignored drug trafficking across the Mexico\u2013United States border at San Diego. The only evidence was a memorandum apparently written by Rudy Camacho, who was the head of the San Diego branch office. Based on this memo, CBS alleged that Camacho had allowed trucks belonging to a particular firm to cross the border unimpeded. Mike Horner, a former Customs Service employee, had passed the memos on to \"60 Minutes\", and even provided a copy with an official stamp. Camacho was not consulted about the piece, and his career was devastated in the immediate term as his own department placed suspicion on him. In the end, it turned out that Horner had forged the documents as an act of revenge for his treatment within the Customs Service. Camacho sued CBS and settled for an undisclosed amount of money in damages. \"60 Minutes\" founder Don Hewitt was forced to issue an on-air retraction.\nKennewick Man.\nA legal battle between archaeologists and the Umatilla tribe over the remains of a skeleton, nicknamed Kennewick Man, was reported by \"60 Minutes\" on October 25, 1998, to which the Umatilla tribe reacted negatively. The tribe considered the segment heavily biased in favor of the scientists, cutting out important arguments, such as explanations of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act. The report focused heavily on the racial politics of the controversy and also added inflammatory arguments, such as questioning the legitimacy of Native American sovereignty \u2013 much of the racial focus of the segment was later reported to have been either unfounded and/or misinterpreted.\nTimothy McVeigh.\nOn March 12, 2000, \"60 Minutes\" aired an interview with Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh. At the time, McVeigh had already been convicted and sentenced to death for the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in April 1995, and the subsequent deaths of 168 people. On the program, McVeigh was given the opportunity to vent against the government. Following the program, a federal policy called the Special Confinement Unit Media Policy was enacted prohibiting face-to-face interviews with death row inmates. A federal inmate challenged the policy in \"Hammer v. Ashcroft\", under which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit upheld the prison policy. In March 2010, the United States Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal in the case, and the policy limiting media access to death row inmates remains in place. CBS refuses to show the entire interview, and has stated no reasons.\nParamount Skydance/CBS cross-promotion.\nIn recent years, the program has been accused of promoting books, films, and interviews with celebrities who are published or promoted by sister businesses of media conglomerate Paramount Skydance and its predecessors since 2000 and publisher Simon &amp; Schuster, without disclosing the journalistic conflict-of-interest to viewers. This includes a 2025 interview with Dana White, who is promoting an upcoming CBS Sports event on July 4, 2026, UFC White House.\nKillian documents controversy.\nThe Killian documents controversy were 6 documents critical of George W. Bush's service in the Texas Air National Guard from 1972-73. Four of these documents were presented as authentic in a \"60 Minutes Wednesday\" episode aired on September 8, 2004, less than two months before the 2004 presidential election, but it was later found that CBS had failed to authenticate the documents. Subsequently, several typewriter and typography experts concluded the documents are forgeries, as have some media sources. No forensic document examiners or typography experts authenticated the documents, which may not be possible without original documents. The provider of the documents, Lt. Col. Bill Burkett, claimed to have burned the originals after faxing copies to CBS. The incident was dramatized for the feature-length film, \"Truth\".\n\"The Internet Is Infected\" episode and the false hacker photo.\nOn March 29, 2009, a segment titled \"The Internet Is Infected\" aired on \"60 Minutes\", which featured an interview with Don Jackson, a data protection professional for SecureWorks. Jackson himself declared in the program that \"a part of [his] job is to know the enemy\". However, during the interview, Jackson showed a photo of Finnish upper-level comprehensive school pupils and misidentified them as Russian hackers. In the photo, one of the children wears a jacket with the coat of arms of Finland on it. Another one wears a cap which clearly has the logo of Karjala, a Finnish brand of beer, on it. The principal of the school in Taivalkoski confirmed that the photo was taken at the school about five years before the program was broadcast.\nThe photo's exact origins are unknown, but it is widely known in Finland, having been originally posted to the Finnish social networking site IRC-Galleria in the early 2000s. It spread all over Finnish internet communities, and even originated a couple of patriotically titled (but intentionally misspelled) mock sites. \"60 Minutes\" later issued a correction and on-air apology.\nBenghazi report.\nAfter the 2012 Benghazi attack, \"60 Minutes\" aired a report by correspondent Lara Logan on October 27, 2013, in which British military contractor Dylan Davies, identified by CBS under the pseudonym \"Morgan Jones\", described racing to the Benghazi compound several hours after the main assault was over, scaling a 12-foot wall and knocking out a lone fighter with the butt of a rifle. He also claimed to have visited a Benghazi hospital earlier that night where he saw Ambassador Christopher Stevens' body.\nIn the days following the report, Davies' personal actions were challenged. The FBI, which had interviewed Davies several times and considered him a credible source, said the account Davies had given them was different from what he told \"60 Minutes\". Davies stood by his story, but the inconsistency ultimately prompted \"60 Minutes\" to conclude it was a mistake to include Davies in their report. The show issued a correction.\nAfter the correction, a journalistic review was conducted by Al Ortiz, CBS News' executive director of standards and practices. Ortiz determined that red flags about Davies' account were missed. Davies had told the program and written in his book that he told an alternative version of his actions to his employer, who he said had demanded that he stay inside his Benghazi villa as the attack unfolded. That alternative version was shared with U.S. authorities; 60 Minutes was unable to prove the story Davies had told them was true.\nDavies' book, \"The Embassy House\", was published two days after the \"60 Minutes\" report, by Threshold Editions, part of the Simon and Schuster unit of CBS. It was pulled from shelves once \"60 Minutes\" issued its correction.\nOn November 26, 2013, Logan was forced to take a leave of absence due to the errors in the Benghazi report. Logan returned to work months later.\nNSA report.\nOn December 15, 2013, \"60 Minutes\" aired a report on the workings of the National Security Agency (NSA) that was widely criticized as misleading and a biased \"puff piece\". Complaints included that the Agency's perspective was presented unchallenged and that privacy campaigners were not invited to present the counter-arguments to the Agency's claims. These claims included NSA denials of \"potentially extralegal\" data collection. The story was reported by John Miller, who once worked in the office of the Director of National Intelligence.\nTesla automaker report.\nOn March 30, 2014, \"60 Minutes\" presented a story on the Tesla Model S luxury electric automobile, with Scott Pelley conducting an interview with CEO Elon Musk concerning the car brand as well as his company SpaceX. Within a day, the automotive blog site Jalopnik reported that the sounds accompanying footage of the car shown during the story were actually sounds from a traditional gasoline engine dubbed over the footage, when in reality the electric car makes no such sounds. CBS released a statement explaining that the sound was the result of an audio editing error, and subsequently removed the sound from the online version of the piece. However, several news outlets, as well as Jalopnik itself, expressed doubt over the authenticity of this explanation, noting the similar scandal involving Tesla Motors and the \"New York Times\" in 2013.\nSexual harassment.\nAfter the resignation of CBS news head Les Moonves, an investigation into sexual harassment at CBS, including \"60 Minutes\", uncovered evidence of long-running sexual harassment issues stemming from behavior of producers Jeff Fager and Don Hewitt.\nFlorida COVID-19 vaccine rollout.\nIn April 2021, Sharyn Alfonsi's story in \"60 Minutes\" on Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and the state's COVID-19 vaccine rollout faced criticism for suggesting that a donation by the supermarket chain Publix to DeSantis' re-election campaign influenced Florida's partnership with Publix stores for vaccine distribution. Subsequently, Palm Beach County Mayor Dave Kerner accused \"60 Minutes\" of reporting \"intentionally false\" information, while Karol Markowicz of the \"New York Post\" characterized Alfonsi as coming off as a \"political activist\" in the segment. A spokesperson for \"60 Minutes\" defended the story for having included DeSantis' response to the accusation. PolitiFact stated that by omitting DeSantis' remarks on why the state partnered with Publix to distribute vaccines, the clip could be considered to be \"deceptive editing\".\nFacial recognition report.\nOn May 16, 2021, Anderson Cooper's story in \"60 Minutes\" on the flaws in facial recognition technology used by the police resulting in incorrect identification of people of color received backlash for denying credit to the black female researchers who pioneered the field. The segment was criticized by the Algorithmic Justice League for \"deliberately excluding the groundbreaking and award-winning work of prominent black women AI researchers Joy Buolamwini, Dr. Timnit Gebru, and Inioluwa Deborah Raji\". The segment was called out for its hypocrisy for failing to credit black women for their pioneering work in a segment highlighting how facial recognition software often leaves out black, Asian, and female faces. CBS later issued a statement explaining that these researchers were not included due to time restrictions of the segment.\nDeceptive editing lawsuit.\nOn December 7, 2024, Donald Trump filed a $20 billion lawsuit against CBS and its parent company, Paramount Global, alleging that the network deceptively edited an interview with Vice President Kamala Harris on \"60 Minutes\" to sway public opinion in her favor. The lawsuit, submitted in the lead-up to the 2024 presidential election, claims that the editing distorted Harris's response regarding Middle East policy. Both parties agreed to enter mediation, coinciding with a planned $8 billion merger between Paramount and Skydance, which requires approval from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Within Paramount, there was reportedly internal disagreement over whether to settle the dispute, as the producers of \"60 Minutes\" maintained their conduct was appropriate and opposed offering an apology. In early April 2025, Trump expressed his \"hope\" that the FCC would punish CBS for running on \"60 Minutes\" stories on Ukraine and Greenland that he disapproved of. Trump filed a lawsuit in Texas accusing CBS of violating the state's Deceptive Trade Practices Act, a consumer protection law. In July 2025, Paramount agreed to a $16 million settlement. As part of the deal, the company did not apologize or admit wrongdoing, agreed to release full transcripts of interviews with future U.S. presidential candidates after they air, and stated that the funds will go to Trump's future presidential library.\nOn April 22, 2025, Bill Owens resigned as the show's executive producer, telling staff he believed he no longer had journalistic independence. He said in a memo that the show would continue to cover the second Trump administration the same way it has covered others. Some said that if the lawsuit by Trump is settled, it would \"continue a trend\" of institutions giving \"in to his demands to avoid punishments such as losing federal funding or access to federal buildings.\" Others reported that while the show's staff was \"shaken\" by the departure of Owens, no one else was expected to resign because it \"would be seen as giving in to Trump,\" with executive editor Tanya Simon, daughter of Bob Simon, beginning to run the show \"on an interim basis,\" following the resignation of Owens. \nIn the \"Last Minute\" segment of the show on April 27, 2025, Scott Pelley praised Owens for ensuring that the types of controversial stories the show had covered since its creation, most recently the Gaza war and the Trump administration, were covered fairly. However, he claimed that recent changes, namely increased supervision\u2014but not censorship\u2014of the show's content by Paramount due to its desire to complete their merger, had led Owens to feel that he \"lost the independence that honest journalism requires.\" Pelley concluded this public rebuke of the network's owner by stating that Owens proved to be the \"right person\" leading the show \"all along.\"\nOn May 19, 2025, CBS News Chief Executive Wendy McMahon followed Bill Owens in resigning. McMahon explained in a memo to staff, \u201cThe past few months have been challenging. It\u2019s become clear that the company and I do not agree on the path forward.\u201d\nOn July 14, 2025, CBS Late Show host Stephen Colbert called the settlement a \"big fat bribe\" and three days later announced CBS will cancel his show and the Late Show itself in May 2026.\nSpin-offs.\nThe main \"60 Minutes\" show has created a number of spin-offs over the years.\n\"30 Minutes\".\n\"30 Minutes\" was a news magazine aimed at children that was patterned after \"60 Minutes\", airing as the final program in CBS's Saturday morning lineup from 1978 to 1982. It was hosted by Christopher Glenn (who also served as the voice-over for the interstitial program \"In the News\" and was an anchor on the CBS Radio Network), along with Betsy Aaron (1978\u20131980) and Betty Ann Bowser (1980\u20131982).\n\"60 Minutes More\".\n\"60 Minutes More\" was a spin-off that ran for one season from March 31, 1997 on the channel CBS Eye on People. The episodes featured popular stories from the past that were expanded with updates on the original story.\n\"60 Minutes II\".\nIn 1999, a second edition of \"60 Minutes\" was started in the United States, titled \"60 Minutes II\". This edition was later renamed \"60 Minutes\" for the fall of 2004 in an effort to sell it as a high-quality program, since some had sarcastically referred to it as \"60 Minutes, Jr.\" CBS News president Andrew Heyward said, \"the Roman numeral II created some confusion on the part of the viewers and suggested a watered-down version\". However, a widely known controversy that came to be known as \"Rathergate\", regarding a report that aired on September 8, 2004, caused another name change. The program was retitled \"60 Minutes Wednesday\" both to differentiate itself and to avoid tarnishing the Sunday edition, as the editions were editorially independent from one another. It reverted to its original Roman numeral title on July 8, 2005, when the program moved to Fridays in an 8:00\u00a0p.m. Eastern Time slot to finish its run. The show aired its final broadcast on September 2, 2005.\n\"60 Minutes on CNBC\".\nIn 2011, CNBC began airing a \"60 Minutes\" spin-off of its own, called \"60 Minutes on CNBC\". Hosted by Lesley Stahl and Steve Kroft, it aired updated business-related reports seen on the original broadcasts and offers footage that was not included when the segments first aired. It ended in 2015.\n\"60 Minutes Sports\".\nIn 2013, CBS's sister premium television network Showtime premiered \"60 Minutes Sports\", a monthly spin-off focused on sports-related stories and classic interviews from the show's archives. Personalities from CBS Sports also contributed to the program; correspondents included Sharyn Alfonsi and Armen Keteyian. The spin-off was considered a competitor to HBO's \"Real Sports\". It was cancelled in January 2017.\n\"60 in 6\".\nIn June 2020, the show launched \"60 in 6\" on Quibi, featuring original weekly 6-minute programs. Correspondents were Enrique Acevedo, Seth Doane, Wesley Lowery, and Laurie Segall. It was originally set to launch in April 2020. On the June 21, 2020, broadcast of \"60 in 6\", Doane covered the show's exposure to COVID-19 in a piece titled \"CBS News Battles COVID-19\". The piece revealed that CBS News had flown in staffers, including from Seattle and Rome, in early March 2020 to begin filming promotional material for \"60 in 6\". This brought COVID-19-positive people in close contact with CBS employees; as a result, CBS Broadcast Center and several other buildings in Manhattan were temporarily closed. Quibi went bankrupt in December 2020 and the program concluded with it.\n\"60 Minutes+\".\nIn March 2021, Paramount+ premiered \"60 Minutes+\", a weekly spin-off aimed at a younger audience. The correspondents from \"60 in 6\" returned for this spin-off, as well as producer Jonathan Blakely. In January 2022, the show was cancelled after 30 episodes.\n25th anniversary edition.\nFor the \"60 Minutes\" 25th anniversary program in 1993, Charles Kuralt revisited notable stories and celebrity appearances and also interviewed Don Hewitt and correspondents, both the active and some former ones.\nInternational versions.\nAustralia.\nThe Australian version of \"60 Minutes\" premiered on February 11, 1979. It still airs each Sunday night at 7:30\u00a0p.m. on the Nine Network and affiliates. Although Nine Network has the rights to the format, as of 2007[ [update]], it does not have rights to stories from the American program, which is owned by competitor 10 News Australia after Network Ten's acquisition by CBS in 2017. Nevertheless, stories from the flagship \"60 Minutes\" program in the U.S. often air on the Australian program by subleasing them from Ten. In 1981, \"60 Minutes\" won a Logie Award for their investigation of lethal abuses at the Chelmsford psychiatric hospital in Sydney.\nGermany.\nIn the mid-1980s, an edited version (approx. 30 minutes in length) of the American broadcast edition of \"60 Minutes\", entitled \"60 Minutes: CBS im Dritten\" (\"60 Minutes: CBS on Channel 3\") was shown for a time on Westdeutsches Fernsehen (regional channels were also called \"Channel 3\" to distinguish it from ARD and ZDF, the two national channels at the time). This version retained the English-language track of the original but also featured German dubbing.\nNew Zealand.\nThe New Zealand version of \"60 Minutes\" has aired on national television since 1989, when it was originally launched on TV3. In 1992, the rights were acquired by TVNZ, who began broadcasting it in 1993. The network aired the program for nine years before dropping it in 2002 for its own program, entitled \"Sunday\", which is currently the highest-rated current affairs show broadcast on New Zealand television, followed by \"20/20\". \"60 Minutes\" was broadcast by rival network TV3, before switching to the Sky Television owned Prime channel in 2013, when the contract changed hands.\nBrazil.\nIn 1992, the GNT channel brought its original version with dubbed subtitles from that country. And later, in 2004, Rede Bandeirantes, planned a licensed localized version, but the plan was cancelled. And even so that year, it returned as a frame, i.e. a rubric in the program \"Domingo Espetacular\" on Rede Record, a competitor of Rede Globo's program \"Fant\u00e1stico\".\nPortugal.\nSIC Not\u00edcias acquired the broadcasting rights to the program in 2001. The original episodes were shown in Portugal with introductory and final comments by journalist M\u00e1rio Crespo, who conducted the program until 2014. It is presently hosted by anchors of the aforementioned network on a rotational basis, who eventually adopted the previous model.\nChile.\nThe news program of National Broadcasting of Chile (TVN), the public television network in that country, was named \"60 Minutos\" (\"60 Minutes\") from 1975 to 1988, but the program had no association with the American version and no investigative reporting.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The city's fall and the destruction of the empire in May sparked fear and religious fervor against the Ottomans across Europe. Pope Nicholas V issued a crusading bull and attempted to negotiate a peace in the ongoing war in northern Italy, which saw Venice and Naples fight with the forces of Florence, Milan, and their French allies. In July, France routed the forces of England at the Battle of Castillon, and subdued the last English holdouts over the following months, ending the Hundred Years' War and English territorial control in France. The Ming dynasty of China was troubled by the growing power of the newly-proclaimed Khagan Esen Taishi in Mongolia. A diplomatic incident occurred when an embassy mission from the Japanese Ashikaga shogunate rioted and attacked Chinese civilians. Violent succession disputes broke out in several countries, including the Ryukyu Kingdom in Okinawa and the Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt.\nA \"mystery eruption\" occurred at an unknown location in the northern hemisphere in late 1452 or early 1453, beginning a 15-year period of colder weather across the hemisphere. A major drought continued in the Aztec Empire, leading to famine and many deaths. China was devastated by catastrophic flooding along the Yellow River and an exceptionally cold winter.\nGlobal events.\nA major volcanic eruption of unknown source likely occurred somewhere in the Northern Hemisphere in late 1452 or early 1453. The Kuwae caldera in Vanuatu was previously seen as a candidate for this eruption, but ice core analysis has instead linked it to another mystery eruption in 1458. Attested through dendrochronology (analysis of tree rings) across the northern hemisphere for 1453, temperatures decreased by 0.4\u20136.9\u00b0C (0.7\u201312.4\u00b0F), beginning a 15-year cold period.\nAfrica.\nSayf al-Din Jaqmaq, sultan of the Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt since 1438, died on February 13. His son Al-Mansur Uthman, only 18 years old, ascended to the throne; desperate to avoid being overthrown for his youth, Uthman attempted to purchase the loyalty of various high-ranking mamluks using heavily debased coinage. Supreme Commander Sayf al-Din Inal led a coup d'\u00e9tat alongside his Zahiri emir allies against the young sultan, seizing the Cairo Citadel. Inal was accepted as sultan by Abbasid Caliph Al-Qa'im in April.\nAsia.\nHostile relationships continued between the Ming Dynasty and the growing Oirat confederation of Esen Taishi. Esen had captured the Yingzong Emperor in battle four years prior, and killed Northern Yuan leader Taisun Khan early in the previous year. Early in the year, the Minister of War Yu Qian considered a plan for an offensive campaign against the Oirat and Mongols, but ultimately focused on maintaining the northern border, unwilling to disrupt the newly reformed command structure of the Ming military. Having dominated the Mongol tribes after his defeat of Taisun, Esen declared himself Khagan of the Northern Yuan, becoming the first non-Borjigin to do so. The alarmed Ming government heightened border security, and debated whether to recognize Esen as Khagan. However, Esen's declaration led to significant internal conflict against his rule.\nA recent series of annual floods worsened in central China, with the Yellow River devastating Henan. Urgent repairs to dikes along the Grand Canal were initially unsuccessful, leading to the appointment of the engineer Xu Youzhen to supervise efforts to maintain the canal and vital grain shipments to Beijing. An exceptionally cold winter caused heavy snow across northern and central China at the end of the year, with many deaths reported in the icebound Huai River valley. Following years of unrest among the Yao and Miao peoples, a regional uprising against Ming rule broke out in Guizhou and Huguang. The somewhat unstable political legitimacy of the Jingtai Emperor in the wake of Yingzong's capture was heightened after the death of Zhu Jianji, his son and heir apparent, on December 18.\nAfter a twenty-year halt, a large Japanese tribute mission was dispatched by the Ashikaga Shogunate to the Ming court. The envoys were angered by court officials' refusal to pay high prices for the wares, and rioted along their return journey, looting civilian houses in Lingqing, Shandong, and attacking officials sent to investigate. The Jingtai Emperor decided not to capture the riotous diplomats, hesitant to upset diplomatic relations with Japan.\nOn the island of Okinawa, a succession dispute between the princes Shiro and Furi of the Ryukyu Kingdom resulted in the burning of Shuri Castle. Sh\u014d Taiky\u016b, possibly a third party to the conflict, would be enthroned as king the following year.\nEurope.\nCentral and Eastern Europe.\nIn 1452\u20131453, the twelve-year-old Ladislaus the Posthumous assumed power in Hungary without a coronation. The previous \"de facto\" ruler, regent J\u00e1nos Hunyadi, maintained a position in government. On October 28, Ladislaus was crowned King of Bohemia in Prague, ending an interregnum that had lasted since the death of Albert II in 1439.\nVasily II, the Grand Prince of Moscow, solidified his power in the waning years of the Muscovite War of Succession. Rival throne claimant Dmitry Shemyaka had been forced to flee to the Novgorod Republic several years prior after a military defeat in Galich. He continued his efforts to take control of Moscow, with his strongholds in the rural northern areas along the Northern Dvina and Vychegda. In 1453, he returned to Veliky Novgorod, where he was fatally poisoned, possibly on Vasily's orders.\nFall of Constantinople.\nMehmed II, the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, began preparations to conquer the city of Constantinople, the capital of the declining Byzantine Empire, soon after his ascension to the throne in 1451. He had fortified the European coast north of the city, giving him full control over the Bosporus Strait. Mehmed mobilized the Ottoman army in early January, and arranged for large bombards to be brought to the staging areas. Some Ottoman forces attacked the Byzantine strongholds of Mesambria and Selybria later in January; Mesambria quickly surrendered, while Selybria held out until March. Mercenary forces led by the Genoese captain Giovanni Giustiniani arrived in the city on January 26, joining Venetian forces stationed in the city.\nOttoman forces began besieging Constantinople itself on April 6, with Mehmed hoping to starve the city into surrender. Although the city's population had declined greatly since its peak, food shortages set in quickly; an emergency order was given to distribute bread to the family of soldiers, as many had abandoned their posts to care for their starving families. With the entrance to the city's harbor, the Golden Horn, blocked by the Byzantines, Ottoman forces transported their ships from the Bosporous into the Golden Horn by hauling them over the hills of Pera. After three smaller assaults over the prior weeks, the Ottomans launched a mass assault on the morning of May 29. The third wave of the assault took the city's walls and subdued the defenders, with the Byzantine emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos dying in unclear circumstances. Ottoman forces sacked the city for three days.\nSome rump states of the Byzantine Empire still remained \u2014 the Despotate of the Morea and the separatist Empire of Trebizond. The Palaiologos scions Demetrios and Thomas shared the title of Despot of the Morea, and fought among themselves. Later in 1453, a rebel leader named Manuel Kantakouzenos led a group of Albanians in the Morea into a rebellion against the despots. Mehmed dispatched the Ottoman general Turahano\u011flu \u00d6mer Bey to put down the revolt, although he would not see immediate success.\nThe fall of Constantinople caused great fear, anxiety, and anger among Christian leaders throughout Europe. Anti-Turkish sentiment spread widely. As the news spread across Europe, songs and poems were composed lamenting the fall of the city and condemning the Ottoman Empire. Prominent examples from 1453 include Balthasar Mandelrei\u00df's poem , commissioned by the Holy Roman imperial court, and Michael Beheim's song-poem . Pope Nicholas V called for a crusade against the Ottoman Empire, issuing a crusading bull on September 30.\nWestern Europe.\nItaly.\nIn Rome, a plot by the humanist nobleman Stefano Porcari to overthrow Pope Nicholas V was discovered and put down by Papal forces in early January. Porcari escaped capture multiple times, but was eventually discovered hiding in a chest, and was executed on January 9.\nA series of regional military conflicts across Northern Italy centered on Lombardy continued in 1453. Francesco Sforza, who had risen to power in Milan, allied with the Republic of Florence against their mutual enemies, Venice and the Kingdom of Naples under Alfonso V of Aragon. In 1452, Milan and Florence entered into an alliance with Charles VII of France, who was opposed to the potential expansion of Alfonso's control in Italy. Held up by its campaign against the English, France was initially unable to offer any direct aid, but was able to prevent the Duchy of Savoy, a Venetian ally, from invading Lombardy.\nOn June 14, Ludovico Gonzaga of Mantua defended Mantua against Venetian forces led by his brother, Carlo Gonzaga. Ren\u00e9 of Anjou, a French nobleman who had previously ruled Naples, allied with Florence and invaded Italy in August 1453 with a force of 2,000 soldiers, which soon grew to 3,000. Initially attempting to negotiate with the Venetians, Rene declared war on the republic on 10 October. Together with Milan and Florence, his forces managed to capture the region around Cremona, Bergamo, and Brescia by late November, although the onset of winter put a halt to the campaign. Concerned by the fall of Constantinople, Pope Nicholas V attempted to negotiate peace in the region in order to unite Christian Europe against the Ottoman Empire. Peace talks sponsored by Nicholas began in November. His efforts would materialize in April of the following year as the Treaty of Lodi.\nEngland and France.\nThe Parliament of England met at Reading on March 6. The members of the parliament were highly receptive to King Henry VI's rule due to the crushing of Jack Cade's Rebellion in 1450 and the reconquest of Gascony by John Talbot in 1452. The parliament approved a grant giving Henry the ability to raise an army of 20,000 archers for a period of six months, likely intend for a future reconquest of Gascony or Normandy.\nA reinforcement of over 2,000 men led by a number of prominent noblemen was sent to Gascony in March, increasing Talbot's forces to upwards of 7,300. However, the French navy was able to cut off English access to Bordeaux via the Gironde estuary, preventing further reinforcement. On July 17, the French routed the English army at the Battle of Castillon, killing Talbot. Charles VII's forces moved further into Gascony, laying siege to Bordeaux in August. The city, alongside the holdout of Rions, surrendered on October 20, ending the English presence in the region and bringing a close to the last phase of the Hundred Years' War.\nHoly Roman Empire.\nThe town of Ghent was embroiled in a rebellion against the Burgundian State under Duke Philip the Good. Originating from a political dispute between Philip and Ghent, Philip declared war on the town in 1452. In February\u2013March 1453, a Ghenter raiding party attacked several towns in the surrounding region, including Kortrijk. Philip's rival, Charles VII of France, supported the Ghent rebels, although was unable to offer direct military support due to his ongoing war against the English. With peace negotiations over the spring stalled, Philip attacked the castles around Ghent in June and July, and decisively defeated the rebels at the Battle of Gavere on July 23. The town was forced to pay reparations to pay for Philip's campaign, although it was not occupied or plundered.\nThe Giant Bible of Mainz was finished on July 9, 1453. It possibly served as an inspiration for the Gutenberg Bible, the first large-scale book produced using a printing press and moveable type. Johannes Gutenberg was overseeing preparations for his bible in 1453 after beginning work on it in 1450. Early copies would be bound and distributed by 1456.\nThe Americas.\nA major drought which began in 1450 continued to affect the Aztec Empire. Although famine conditions had already begun to set in, they worsened in 1453, and people resorted to famine foods such as the roots of wild plants, corn silk, and agave. Some sold themselves into slavery in exchange for maize. Many died from starvation, especially due to early frosts in the autumn of 1453. The drought and famine would only intensify in the following year.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is also called 100VG-AnyLAN because it was defined to carry both Ethernet and Token Ring frame types.\n100BaseVG was originally proposed by Hewlett-Packard, ratified by the IEEE in 1995 and was practically extinct by 1998. In 2001 IEEE recorded the status of its 100BaseVG standard as being a \"Withdrawn Standard\" (defined as \"A standard which is no longer maintained and which may contain significant obsolete or erroneous information.\")\nStandardization.\n100BaseVG started in the IEEE 802.3 committee as Fast Ethernet. One faction wanted to keep carrier-sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) in order to keep it pure Ethernet, even though the collision domain problem limited the distances to one tenth that of 10BASE-T. Another faction wanted to change to a polling architecture from the hub (they called it \"Demand Priority Protocol\") in order to maintain the 10BASE-T distances, and also to make it a deterministic protocol. The first faction argued that, since IEEE 802.3 was the Ethernet committee, it was not the place to develop a different protocol. Thus, the IEEE 802.12 committee was formed and standardized 100BaseVG.\nPhysical layer.\nThe physical layer requires four twisted pairs of \"voice-grade\" cabling for a link, so Category 3 cables or better can be used. While control signaling uses two pairs for each direction simultaneously, all four pairs are switched to a single direction during data transmission, as required and defined during control signaling. This makes 100BaseVG an inherently half-duplex medium like e.g. 10BASE5 (yet faster) but without the CSMA/CD drawbacks.\n100BaseVG also supports full-duplex operation over optical fiber or over two pairs of shielded twisted pair.\n100VG-AnyLAN vs. Fast Ethernet.\nMultiplexing.\nInstead of following the Fast Ethernet standard for twisted pair cabling by using only 2 pairs of wires, 100VG-AnyLAN used all four pairs in either Category 3 or Category 5 twisted pair cable. The design goals were to avoid the radio frequency radiation emitted at the higher frequencies required by Fast Ethernet and to leverage existing wiring installations of Category 3 cabling that most organizations had recently installed to support 10 megabit twisted-pair Ethernet. This had the additional advantage of being less susceptible to external sources of RF interference such as other network cables, fluorescent lights, and high power lines. They multiplexed the signal across all 8 wires thereby lowering the frequency and making it more robust. This presented a problem with early installations that borrowed one unused twisted pair for telephone traffic but those installations were uncommon.\nDeterministic.\nWhen Ethernet became Fast Ethernet, it continued to use the CSMA/CD mechanism to manage traffic on the network cable. 100VG took advantage of the token passing concept that made ARCNET and Token Ring popular in order to provide consistent performance no matter how large the network became. It removed the token passing responsibility from the wiring and network nodes and placed it internal to the 100VG-AnyLAN hubs. These hubs contained the rotating token that never left the hub itself. When a node wanted to transmit data, it would raise a bit on its hub port connection that indicated to the hub that it was ready. As the token passed by a ready hub port, it would then open up traffic to that node. Because the token stayed within the hub, it did not have to traverse long cables going to every node as in ARCNET and Token Ring, thereby becoming faster than those other deterministic networking standards and being less susceptible to cabling problems, network card failures, and line interference. Real-life load testing showed 100VG-AnyLAN reaching 95% of its theoretical network speed instead of about 45% as in Fast Ethernet when using hubs. Fast Ethernet switches were not commonplace at first because of high cost and limited availability so, initially, 100VG had a significant performance advantage.\nDemand Priority.\nCertain workloads demand their data be delivered at particular times - video and audio are good examples. On lightly used networks this traffic can be sent as normal data, but on busy networks, retransmission delays can push delivery outside the jitter limits of the data.\nVG introduced the concept of Demand Priority to address this problem. When a node requests the ability to send data, it indicates this has high or normal priority. High-priority data is given transmission permission as soon as possible, typically as soon as any current data packet is completed. By letting the hub manage access, the architecture can guarantee required bandwidth and requested service priority to particular applications or nodes. It also can guarantee that the network can be scaled up (enlarged) without loss of bandwidth.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Standardized in 1984, it was the dominant Ethernet standard during the mid to late 1980s.\nThe use of twisted pair networks competed with 10BASE2's use of a single coaxial cable. In 1988, Ethernet over twisted pair was introduced, running at the same speed of 10\u00a0Mbit/s. In 1995, the Fast Ethernet standard upgraded the speed to 100\u00a0Mbit/s, and no such speed improvement was ever made for thinnet. By 2001, prices for Fast Ethernet cards had fallen to under $50. By 2003, Wi-Fi networking equipment was widely available and affordable.\nDue to the immense demand for high-speed networking, the low cost of Category 5 cable, and the popularity of 802.11 wireless networks, both 10BASE2 and 10BASE5 have become increasingly obsolete, though devices still exist in some locations. As of 2011, IEEE 802.3 has deprecated this standard for new installations.\nName origination.\nThe name \"10BASE2\" is derived from several characteristics of the physical medium. The \"10\" comes from the transmission speed of 10\u00a0Mbit/s. The \"BASE\" stands for baseband signaling, and the \"2\" for a maximum segment length approaching 200\u00a0m (the actual maximum length is 185\u00a0m).\nSignal encoding.\n10\u00a0Mbit/s Ethernet uses Manchester coding. A binary zero is indicated by a low-to-high transition in the middle of the bit period and a binary one is indicated by a high-to-low transition in the middle of the bit period. Manchester coding allows the clock to be recovered from the signal. However, the additional transitions associated with it double the signal bandwidth.\nNetwork design.\n10BASE2 coax cables have a maximum length of . The maximum practical number of nodes that can be connected to a 10BASE2 segment is limited to 30 with a minimum distance of between devices. In a 10BASE2 network, each stretch of cable is connected to the transceiver (which is usually built into the network adaptor) using a BNC T-connector, with one stretch connected to each female connector of the T. The T-connector must be plugged directly into the network adaptor with no cable in between.\nAs is the case with most other high-speed buses, Ethernet segments have to be terminated with a resistor at each end. Each end of the cable has a resistor attached. Typically this resistor is built into a male BNC and attached to the last device on the bus. This is most commonly connected directly to the T-connector on a workstation. If termination is missing, or if there is a break in the cable, the AC signal on the bus is reflected, rather than dissipated, when it reaches the end. This reflected signal is indistinguishable from a collision, so no communication can take place.\nSome terminators have a metallic chain attached to them for grounding purposes. The cable should be grounded only at one end. Grounding the terminators at both may produce a ground loop and can cause network outages or data corruption when swells of electricity traverse the coaxial cabling's outer shield.\nWhen wiring a 10BASE2 network, special care has to be taken to ensure that cables are properly connected to all T-connectors. Bad contacts or shorts are especially difficult to diagnose. A failure at any point of the network cabling tends to prevent all communications. For this reason, 10BASE2 networks can be difficult to maintain and were often replaced by 10BASE-T networks, which (provided category 5 cable or better was used) also provided a good upgrade path to 100BASE-TX.\nComparisons to 10BASE-T.\n10BASE2 networks cannot generally be extended without breaking service temporarily for existing users and the presence of many joints in the cable also makes them very vulnerable to accidental or malicious disruption. There were proprietary systems that claimed to avoid these problems (e.g. EAD sockets) but these never became widespread, possibly due to a lack of standardization. 10BASE-T can be extended by making a new connection to a hub. A fault in a one hub connection does not necessarily compromise other connections to the hub.\n10BASE2 systems did have a number of advantages over 10BASE-T. No hub is required as with 10BASE-T, so the hardware cost was minimal, and wiring was particularly easy since only a single wire run is needed, which could be sourced from the nearest computer. These characteristics made 10BASE2 ideal for a small network of two or three machines, perhaps in a home where easily concealed wiring was an advantage. For a larger complex office network, the difficulties of tracing poor connections made it impractical. Unfortunately for 10BASE2, by the time multiple home computer networks became common, the format had already been practically superseded by 10BASE-T.\nComparisons to 10BASE5, use of AUI.\n10BASE2 uses RG-58A/U cable or similar for a maximum segment length of 185\u00a0m as opposed to the thicker RG-8-like cable used in 10BASE5 networks with a maximum length of 500\u00a0m. The RG-58 type wire used by 10BASE2 was inexpensive, smaller and much more flexible than the specialized RG-8 variant. 10BASE2 can also use RG-59 cable.\nAn Ethernet network interface controller (NIC) may include the 10BASE2 transceivers and thus directly provide a 10BASE2 BNC connector (that the T-connector plugs into), or it may offer an AUI connector that external transceivers (see Medium Attachment Unit) can connect to. These can be transceivers for 10BASE2, but also for 10BASE5 or 10BASE-T. Some NICs offer both BNC and AUI connectors, or other combinations including BNC and 10BASE-T. With multiple connections, only one connector is designed to be used at the same time.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The technology was standardized in 1982 as IEEE 802.3. 10BASE5 uses a thick and stiff coaxial cable up to in length. Up to 100 stations can be connected to the cable using vampire taps and share a single collision domain with 10\u00a0Mbit/s of bandwidth shared among them. The system is difficult to install and maintain.\n10BASE5 was superseded by much cheaper and more convenient alternatives: first by 10BASE2 based on a thinner coaxial cable (1985), and then, once Ethernet over twisted pair was developed, by 10BASE-T (1990) and its successors 100BASE-TX and 1000BASE-T. In 2003, the IEEE 802.3 working group deprecated 10BASE5 for new installations.\nName origination.\nThe name \"10BASE5\" is derived from several characteristics of the physical medium. The \"10\" refers to its transmission speed of 10\u00a0Mbit/s. The \"BASE\" is short for baseband signaling (as opposed to broadband), and the \"5\" stands for the maximum segment length of .\nNetwork design and installation.\nFor its physical layer 10BASE5 uses cable similar to RG-8/U coaxial cable but with extra braided shielding. This is a stiff, diameter cable with an impedance of 50\u00a0ohms, a solid center conductor, a foam insulating filler, a shielding braid, and an outer jacket. The outer jacket is often yellow-to-orange fluorinated ethylene propylene (for fire resistance) so it often is called \"yellow cable\", \"orange hose\", or sometimes humorously \"frozen yellow garden hose\". 10BASE5 coaxial cables had a maximum length of . Up to 100 nodes could be connected to a 10BASE5 segment.\nTransceiver nodes can be connected to cable segments with N connectors, or via a \"vampire tap\", which allows new nodes to be added while existing connections are live. A vampire tap clamps onto the cable, a hole is drilled through the outer shielding, and a spike is forced to pierce the outer three layers and contact the inner conductor while other spikes bite into the outer braided shield. Care is required to keep the outer shield from touching the spike; installation kits include a \"coring tool\" to drill through the outer layers and a \"braid pick\" to clear stray pieces of the outer shield.\nTransceivers should be installed only at precise 2.5-meter intervals. This distance was chosen to \"not\" correspond to the signal's wavelength; this ensures that the reflections from multiple taps are not in phase. These suitable points are marked on the cable with black bands. The cable is required to be one continuous run; T-connections are not allowed.\nAs is the case with most other high-speed buses, segments must be terminated at each end. For coaxial-cable-based Ethernet, each end of the cable has a 50\u00a0ohm resistor attached. Typically this resistor is built into a male N connector and attached to the cable's end just past the last device. With termination missing, or if there is a break in the cable, the signal on the bus will be reflected, rather than dissipated when it reaches the end. This reflected signal is indistinguishable from a collision and prevents communication.\nDisadvantages.\nAdding new stations to the network is complicated by the need to pierce the cable accurately. The cable is stiff and difficult to bend around corners. One improper connection can take down the whole network and finding the source of the trouble is difficult.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are a subset of all Ethernet physical layers.\nEarly Ethernet used various grades of coaxial cable, but in 1984, StarLAN showed the potential of simple unshielded twisted pair. This led to the development of 10BASE-T and its successors 100BASE-TX, 1000BASE-T, 10GBASE-T and 40GBASE-T, supporting speeds of 10 and 100\u00a0megabits per second, then 1, 10 and 40\u00a0gigabits per second respectively. \nTwo new variants of 10-megabit-per-second Ethernet over a \"single\" twisted pair, known as 10BASE-T1S and 10BASE-T1L, were standardized in IEEE Std 802.3cg-2019. 10BASE-T1S has its origins in the automotive industry and may be useful in other short-distance applications where substantial electrical noise is present. 10BASE-T1L is a long-distance Ethernet, supporting connections up to 1\u00a0km in length. Both of these standards are finding applications implementing the Internet of things. 10BASE-T1S is a direct competitor of CAN\u00a0XL in the automotive space and includes a PHY-Level Collision Avoidance scheme (PLCA).\nThe earlier standards use 8P8C modular connectors and supported cable standards range from Category\u00a03 to Category\u00a08. These cables typically have four pairs of wires for each connection, although early Ethernet used only two of the pairs. Unlike the earlier -T standards, the -T1 interfaces were designed to operate over a single pair of conductors and introduce the use of two new connectors referred to as IEC 63171-1 and IEC 63171-6.\nHistory.\nThe first two early designs of twisted-pair networking were StarLAN, standardized by the IEEE Standards Association as IEEE 802.3e in 1986, at one megabit per second, and LattisNet, developed in January 1987, at 10\u00a0megabits per second. Both were developed before the 10BASE-T standard (published in 1990 as IEEE 802.3i) and used different signaling, so they were not directly compatible with it.\nIn 1988, AT&amp;T released StarLAN\u00a010, named for working at 10 Mbit/s. The StarLAN\u00a010 signaling was used as the basis of 10BASE-T, with the addition of \"link beat\" to quickly indicate connection status.\nUsing twisted-pair cabling in a star topology addressed several weaknesses of the previous Ethernet standards:\nAlthough 10BASE-T is rarely used as a normal-operation signaling rate today, it is still in wide use with network interface controllers in wake-on-LAN power-down mode and for special, low-power, low-bandwidth applications. 10BASE-T is still supported on most twisted-pair Ethernet ports with up to Gigabit Ethernet speed.\nNaming.\nThe common names for the standards derive from aspects of the physical media. The leading number (\"10\" in 10BASE-T) refers to the transmission speed in Mbit/s. \"BASE\" denotes that baseband transmission is used. The \"T\" designates twisted-pair cable. Where there are several standards for the same transmission speed, they are distinguished by a letter or digit following the T, such as \"TX\" or \"T4\", referring to the encoding method and number of lanes.\nCabling.\nMost Ethernet cables are wired \"straight-through\" (pin 1 to pin 1, pin 2 to pin 2, and so on). In some instances, the \"crossover\" form (receive to transmit and transmit to receive) may still be required.\nA cable for Ethernet may be wired to either the T568A or T568B termination standard at both ends of the cable. Since these standards differ only in that they swap the positions of pairs 2 and 3\u00a0\u2013 the only pairs used by the formerly common 10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX\u00a0\u2013 a cable with T568A wiring at one end and T568B at the other functions as a crossover cable for the older, two-pair standards.\nA 10BASE-T or 100BASE-TX host normally uses connector wiring called \"medium dependent interface\" (\"MDI\"), transmitting on pins 1 and 2 and receiving on pins 3 and 6. An infrastructure node (such as a hub or a switch) normally uses the complementary wiring arrangement, called \"MDI-X\", the \"X\" standing for \"-crossover\". MDI-X simply reverses the pairs, transmitting on pins 3 and 6 and receiving on pins 1 and 2. These ports are connected using a straight-through cable so each transmitter talks to the receiver on the other end of the cable. (Modern twisted-pair Ethernet uses all four pairs, differently, and the MDI\u2013MDI-X distinction does not apply.)\nLater equipment often can automatically switch between MDI and MDI-X arrangements as needed, obviating crossover cables and manual selection, but in the conventional arrangement, when two nodes having the same (fixed) type of port need to be connected, a crossover cable is required. If both devices being connected support 1000BASE-T, they will connect regardless of whether a straight-through or crossover cable is used.\nA 10BASE-T transmitter sends two differential voltages, +2.5\u00a0V or \u22122.5\u00a0V. A 100BASE-TX transmitter sends three differential voltages, +1\u00a0V, 0\u00a0V, or \u22121\u00a0V. Unlike earlier Ethernet standards using broadband and coaxial cable, such as 10BASE5 (thicknet) and 10BASE2 (thinnet), 10BASE-T does not specify the exact type of wiring to be used but instead specifies certain characteristics that a cable must meet. This was done in anticipation of using 10BASE-T in existing twisted-pair wiring systems that did not conform to any specified wiring standard. Some of the specified characteristics are attenuation, characteristic impedance, propagation delay, and several types of crosstalk. Cable testers are widely available to check these parameters to determine if a cable can be used with 10BASE-T. These characteristics are expected to be met by 100 meters of 24-gauge unshielded twisted-pair cable. However, with high-quality cabling, reliable cable runs of 150 meters or longer are often achievable and are considered viable by technicians familiar with the 10BASE-T specification.\n100BASE-TX follows the same wiring patterns as 10BASE-T, but is more sensitive to wire quality and length, due to the higher bit rates.\n1000BASE-T uses all four pairs bi-directionally using hybrid circuits and cancellers. Data is encoded using 4D-PAM5; four dimensions using pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) with five voltages, \u22122\u00a0V, \u22121\u00a0V, 0\u00a0V, +1\u00a0V, and +2\u00a0V. While +2\u00a0V to \u22122\u00a0V may appear at the pins of the line driver, the voltage on the cable is nominally +1\u00a0V, +0.5\u00a0V, 0\u00a0V, \u22120.5\u00a0V and \u22121\u00a0V.\n100BASE-TX and 1000BASE-T were both designed to require a minimum of Category 5 cable and also specify a maximum cable length of .\nShared cable.\n10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX require only two pairs (pins 1\u20132, 3\u20136) to operate. Since common Category 5 cable has four pairs, it is possible to use the spare pairs (pins 4\u20135, 7\u20138) in 10- and 100-Mbit/s configurations for other purposes. The spare pairs may be used for power over Ethernet (PoE), for two plain old telephone service (POTS) lines, or for a second 10BASE-T or 100BASE-TX connection. In practice, great care must be taken to separate these pairs as 10/100-Mbit/s Ethernet equipment electrically terminates the unused pins (\"Bob Smith Termination\"). Shared cable is not an option for Gigabit Ethernet as 1000BASE-T requires all four pairs to operate.\nSingle-pair.\nIn addition to the more computer-oriented two and four-pair variants, the 10BASE-T1, 100BASE-T1 and 1000BASE-T1 single-pair Ethernet (SPE) physical layers are intended for Automotive, IoT, and M2M applications or as optional data channels in other interconnect applications. The distances that single pair operates at full duplex depends on the speed: 1000\u00a0m (1\u00a0km) with 802.3cg-2019 10BASE-T1L; with 100BASE-T1 (link segment type\u00a0A); up to using 1000BASE-T1 link segment type\u00a0B with up to four in-line connectors. Both physical layers require a balanced twisted pair with an impedance of 100\u00a0\u03a9. The cable must be capable of transmitting 600\u00a0MHz for 1000BASE-T1 and 66\u00a0MHz for 100BASE-T1. 2.5\u00a0Gbit/s, 5\u00a0Gbit/s, and 10\u00a0Gbit/s over a 15\u00a0m single pair is standardized in 802.3ch-2020. In June 2023, 802.3cy added 25\u00a0Gbit/s speeds at lengths up to 11\u00a0m.\nSimilar to PoE, Power over Data Lines (PoDL) can provide up to 50\u00a0W to a device.\nAutonegotiation and duplex.\nEthernet over twisted-pair standards up through Gigabit Ethernet define both full-duplex and half-duplex communication. However, half-duplex operation for gigabit speed is not supported by any existing hardware. Higher speed standards, 2.5GBASE-T up to 40GBASE-T running at 2.5 to 40 Gbit/s, consequently define only full-duplex point-to-point links which are generally connected by network switches, and do not support the traditional shared-medium CSMA/CD operation.\nMany different modes of operations (10BASE-T half-duplex, 10BASE-T full-duplex, 100BASE-TX half-duplex, etc.) exist for Ethernet over twisted pair, and most network adapters are capable of different modes of operation. Autonegotiation is required in order to make a working 1000BASE-T connection.\nWhen two linked interfaces are set to different duplex modes, the effect of this duplex mismatch is a network that functions much more slowly than its nominal speed. Duplex mismatch may be inadvertently caused when an administrator configures an interface to a fixed mode (e.g. 100 Mbit/s full-duplex) and fails to configure the remote interface, leaving it set to autonegotiate. Then, when the auto-negotiation process fails, half-duplex is assumed by the autonegotiating side of the link.\nVariants.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:row hover highlight/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The corrected -A version was released in 1987 by National Semiconductor. It is frequently used to implement the serial port for IBM PC compatible personal computers, where it is often connected to an RS-232 interface for modems, serial mice, printers, and similar peripherals. It was the first serial chip used in the IBM PS/2 line, which were introduced in 1987.\nThe part was originally made by National Semiconductor. Similarly numbered devices, with varying levels of compatibility with the original National Semiconductor part, are made by other manufacturers. A UART function that is register-compatible with the 16550 is usually a feature of multifunction I/O cards for IBM PC-compatible computers and may be integrated on the motherboard of other compatible computers.\nReplacement of the factory-installed 8250 UART was a common upgrade for owners of IBM PC, XT, and compatible computers when high-speed modems became available. Above 9600 baud, owners discovered that the serial ports of the computers were not able to handle a continuous flow of data without losing characters. Exchange of the 8250 (having only a one-byte received data buffer) with a 16550\u2014and occasionally patching or setting system software to be aware of the FIFO feature of the new chip\u2014improved the reliability and stability of high-speed connections.\nFeatures.\nMain features of the 16550 include:\nBoth the computer hardware and software interface of the 16550 are backward compatible with the earlier 8250 UART and 16450 UART. The current version (since 1995) by Texas Instruments which bought National Semiconductor is called the 16550D.\nThe 16550A and newer is pin-compatible with the 16450, but the Microsoft diagnostics program (MSD) supplied with MS-DOS 6.x, Windows 9x, Windows Me, and Windows 2000 often report the 16450 chip as an 8250 chip.\nThe FIFO buffer.\nOne drawback of the earlier 8250 UARTs and 16450 UARTs was that interrupts were generated for each byte received. This generated high rates of interrupts as transfer speeds increased. More critically, with only a 1-byte buffer there is a genuine risk that a received byte will be overwritten if interrupt service delays occur. To overcome these shortcomings, the 16550 series UARTs incorporated a 16-byte FIFO buffer with a programmable interrupt trigger of 1, 4, 8, or 14\u00a0bytes.\nThe 16550 also incorporates a transmit FIFO, though this feature is less critical as delays in interrupt service would only result in sub-optimal transmission speeds and not actual data loss.\nThe 16550A(F) version was a must-have to use modems with a data transmit rate of 9600\u00a0baud. Dropouts occurred with 14.4\u00a0kbit/s (V.32bis and higher) units and as compression was added with V.42 getting more data per interrupt was critical as data speed continued to increase.\nIssue with the buffer.\nThe original 16550 had a bug that prevented this FIFO from being used. National Semiconductor later released the 16550A which corrected this issue. Not all manufacturers adopted this nomenclature, however, continuing to refer to the fixed chip as a 16550.\nAccording to another source, the FIFO issue was corrected only in the 16550AF model, with the A model still being buggy. (The C and CF models are okay too, according to this source.) The 16550AFN model added DMA transfers.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "35224", "revid": "211905", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35224", "title": "NS32000", "text": "32-bit microprocessor\nThe NS32000, sometimes known as the 32k, is a series of microprocessors produced by National Semiconductor. Design work began around 1980 and it was announced at the International Solid-State Circuits Conference in April 1981.\nThe first member of the family came to market in 1982, briefly known as the 16032 before being renamed as the 32016. It was the first general-purpose microprocessor on the market that used 32-bit data internally: the Motorola 68000 had 32-bit registers and instructions to perform 32-bit arithmetic, but used a 16-bit ALU for arithmetic operations on data, and thus took twice as long as the 32016 to perform those arithmetic operations. However, the 32016 contained many bugs and often could not be run at its rated speed. These problems, and the presence of the otherwise similar 68000 which had been available since 1980, led to little use in the market despite considerable early interest.\nSeveral improved versions followed, including 1985's 32032 which was essentially a bug-fixed 32016 with an external 32-bit data bus. While it offered about 50% better speed than the 32016, it was outperformed by the 32-bit Motorola 68020, released a year prior. The 32532, released in 1987, outperformed the contemporary Motorola 68030 by almost two times, but by this time most interest in microprocessors had turned to RISC platforms and this otherwise excellent design saw almost no use as well.\nNational was working on further improvements in the 32732, but eventually gave up attempting to compete in the central processing unit (CPU) space. Instead, the basic 32000 architecture was combined with several support systems and relaunched as the Swordfish microcontroller. This had some success in the market before it was replaced by the CompactRISC architecture in mid-1990s.\nDesign concept.\nThe NS32000 series traces its history to an effort by National Semiconductor to produce a single-chip implementation of the VAX-11 architecture. The VAX is well known for its highly \"orthogonal\" instruction set architecture (ISA), in which any instruction can be applied to any data. For instance, an codice_1 instruction might add the contents of two processor registers, or one register against a value in memory, two values in memory, or use the register as an offset against an address. This flexibility was considered the paragon of design in the era of complex instruction set computers (CISC).\nNational took Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) to court in California to ensure the legality of the design, but when DEC had the lawsuit moved to Massachusetts, DEC's home state, the lawsuit was dropped and the Series 32000 architecture was developed instead. Although the new instruction set architecture was not VAX-11 compatible, it did retain its highly \"orthogonal\" design philosophy. That is, every instruction could be used with any type of data. Articles of the time also referred to this as \"symmetrical\".\nThe original processor family consisted of the NS16032 CPU and a NS16C032 low-power variant, both having a 16-bit data path and so requiring two machine cycles to load a single 32-bit word. Both could be used with the NS16082 memory management unit (MMU), which provided 24-bit virtual memory support for up to 16\u00a0MB physical memory. The NS16008 was a cut-down version with an 8-bit external data path and no virtual memory support, which had a reduced pin count and was thus somewhat easier to implement. Both the NS16008 and NS16016 were to feature an emulation mode for the Intel 8080 running at four times the speed of that processor.\nAt the same time, National Semiconductor also announced two future versions, the NS32032 and NS32132. The former was essentially a version of the NS16032 with a 32-bit external data bus, allowing it to read data at twice the rate. This was project to be released in 1984. The NS32132 was a version with a 29-bit internal addresses and 32-bit external, allowing it to address a complete 4\u00a0GB of memory. It was to be released in 1985.\nAll of these could also be used with the NS16081 floating-point unit (FPU).\nArchitecture.\nThe processors have 8 general-purpose 32-bit registers, plus a series of special-purpose registers:\n(Additional system registers not listed).\nThe instruction set is very much in the CISC model, with 2-operand instructions, memory-to-memory operations, flexible addressing modes, and variable-length byte-aligned instruction encoding. Addressing modes can involve up to two displacements and two memory indirections per operand as well as scaled indexing, making the longest conceivable instruction 23 bytes. The actual number of instructions is much lower than that of contemporary RISC processors.\nUnlike some other processors, automatic increment of the base register is not provided; the only exception is a \"top of stack\" addressing modes that pop sources and push destinations. Uniquely, the size of the displacement is encoded in its most significant bits: 0, 10 and 11 preceded 7-, 14- and 30-bit signed displacements. (Although the processors are otherwise consistently little-endian, displacements in the instruction stream are stored in big-endian order).\nGeneral-purpose operands are specified using a 5-bit field. To this can be added an index byte (specifying the index register and 5-bit base address), and up to 2 variable-length displacements per operand.\n32016.\nThe first chip in the series was originally referred to as the 16032, but later renamed 32016 to emphasize its 32-bit internals. This contrasts it with its primary competitor in this space, 1979's Motorola 68000 (68k). The 68k used 32-bit instructions and registers, but its arithmetic logic unit (ALU), which controls much of the overall processing task, was only 16-bit. This meant it had to cycle 32-bit data through the ALU twice\u2014in two 16-bit halves\u2014to complete a 32-bit operation. In contrast, the NS32000 has a 32-bit ALU, so that 32-bit and 16-bit instructions take the same time to complete.\nThe 32016 first shipped in 1982 in a 48-pin DIP package. To fit a 32-bit chip into a 48-pin package required the data bus to be 16-bits wide, and to share pins with the 24-bit address bus. By sharing pins, external hardware had to latch the address for the memory address while the pins were used in data mode, and this introduces a 1-cycle delay in every access. So while the internal 32-bit implementation improves performance, the small pin-count decreases it again.\nIt may have been the first 32-bit chip to reach mass production and sale (at least according to National's marketing). In a report in a June 1983 publication, however, it was remarked that National was \"promising production quantities this summer\" of 16032 parts, having been \"shipping sample quantities for several months\", with the floating point co-processor sampling \"this month\".\nAlthough a 1982 introduction post-dates the 68k by about two years, the 68k was not yet being widely used in the market and the 32016 generated significant interest. Unfortunately, the early versions were filled with bugs and could rarely be run at their rated speed. By 1984, after two years, the errata list still contained items specifying uncontrollable conditions that would result in the processor coming to a halt, forcing a reset.\nThe original product roadmap envisaged 6\u00a0MHz and 10\u00a0MHz parts during 1983 and 12\u00a0MHz and 14\u00a0MHz parts during 1984. However, press reports in 1984 indicated difficulties in keeping to this roadmap, with it reportedly having taken five months to increase the frequency of the parts from 6\u00a0MHz to 8\u00a0MHz, and with representatives estimating a further \"two, three or five months\" to increase the frequency to 10\u00a0MHz. Two unspecified chips of the five in the chipset were reported to be the cause of these problems. An early 1985 article about the 32016-based Whitechapel MG-1 workstation noted that the 32082 memory management unit was \"suffering from bugs\" and had been situated on its own board providing hardware fixes. In 1986, Texas Instruments announced a \"fully qualified 10\u00a0MHz TI32000 32-bit microprocessor chip set\" consisting of the TI32016 CPU and TI32082 memory management unit as 48-pin devices, the TI32201 timing control unit and TI32081 floating-point unit as 24-pin devices, and the TI32202 interrupt control unit as a 40-pin device, with the five-device chipset \"priced at $289 in 100-unit quantities\".\nNational changed its design methodology to make it possible to get the part into production and a design system based on the language \"Z\" was co-developed with the University of Tel-Aviv, close to the \"NSC\" design centre in Herzliya, Israel. The \"Z\" language is similar to today's Verilog and VHDL, but has a Pascal-like syntax and is optimized for two-phase clock designs. However, by the times the fruit of these efforts were being felt in the design, numerous 68k machines were already on the market, notably the Apple Macintosh, and the 32016 never saw widespread use.\nThe 32016 has a 16-bit external data bus, a 24-bit external address bus, and a full 32-bit instruction set. It also includes a coprocessor interface, allowing coprocessors such as FPUs and MMUs to be attached as peers to the main processor. The MMU is based on demand paging virtual memory, which is the most unusual feature compared to the segmented memory approach used by the competition, and has become the standard for how microprocessors are designed today. The architecture supports an instruction restart mechanism on a page fault, which is much cleaner than the Motorola approach to dump the internal status on a page fault, which has to be read back, before the instruction is continued.\nWhile often compared to the 68k's instruction set, this was rejected by NSC employees; one of the key marketing phrases of the time was \"Elegance is Everything\", comparing the highly orthogonal Series 32000 to the \"kludge\". One key difference is Motorola's use of address registers and data registers, with instructions only working on either address or data registers. The Series 32000 has general-purpose registers, described as \"address-data\" registers in technical documentation.\n32032.\nThe 32032 was introduced in 1984. It is almost completely compatible with the 32016, but features a 32-bit data bus (although keeping the 24-bit address bus) for somewhat faster performance, described as \"minicomputer performance\" comparable with that of a VAX-11 system. There was also a 32008, a 32016 with a data bus cut down to 8-bits wide for low-cost applications. It is philosophically similar to the MC68008, and equally unpopular.\nNational also produced a series of related support chips like the NS32081 floating point unit (FPU), NS32082 memory management unit (MMU), NS32203 direct memory access (DMA) and NS32202 interrupt controllers. With the full set plus memory chips and peripherals, it was feasible to build a 32-bit computer system capable of supporting modern multi-tasking operating systems, something that had previously been possible only on expensive minicomputers and mainframes.\n32332, 32532.\nIn 1985, National Semi introduced the NS32332, a much-improved version of the 32032. From the datasheet, the enhancements include \"the addition of new dedicated addressing hardware (consisting of a high speed ALU, a barrel shifter and an address register), a very efficient increased (20 bytes) instruction prefetch queue, a new system/memory bus interface/protocol, increased efficiency slave processor protocol and finally enhancements of microcode.\" There was also a new NS32382 MMU, NS32381 FPU and the (very rare) NS32310 interface to a Weitek FPA. The aggregate performance boost of the NS32332 from these enhancements only made it 50 percent faster than the original NS32032, and therefore less than that of the main competitor, the MC68020.\nNational Semi introduced the NS32532 in early 1987. Running at 20-, 25- &amp; 30-MHz, it was a complete redesign of the internal implementation with a five-stage pipeline, an integrated Cache/MMU and improved memory performance, making it about twice as performant as the competing MC68030 and i80386. At this stage RISC architectures were starting to make inroads, and the main competitors became the now equally dead AM29000 and MC88000, which was considered faster than the NS32532. For floating-point, the NS32532 used the existing NS32381 or the NS32580 interface to a Weitek FPA. The NS32532 was the basis of the PC532, a \"public domain\" hardware project, and one of the few to produce a useful machine running a real operating system (in this case, Minix or NetBSD).\nThe semi-mythical NS32732 (sometimes called NS32764), envisioned as the high-performance successor to the NS32532, never came to the market.\nSwordfish.\nA derivative of the NS32732 known as Swordfish and given the designation NS32SF640 was announced in early 1991. Aimed at embedded systems, Swordfish has an integrated floating point unit, timers, DMA controllers and other peripherals not normally available in microprocessors. It has a 64-bit data bus and employs a 50\u00a0MHz internal clock, double that of the 25\u00a0MHz system clock. The chief architect of the Swordfish is Donald Alpert, who went on to manage the architectural team designing the Pentium. The Pentium internal microarchitecture is similar to the preceding Swordfish.\nThe focus of Swordfish was high-end PostScript laser printers, and performance was exceptional at the time. Competing solutions could render about one new page per minute, but the Swordfish demo unit would print out sixteen pages per minute, limited only by the laser-engine mechanics. On each page it would print out how much time it was idling, waiting for the engine to complete.\nThe Swordfish die is huge, and it was eventually decided to drop the project altogether, and the product never went into production. The lessons from the Swordfish were used for the CompactRISC designs. In the beginning, there were both a CompactRISC-32 and a CompactRISC-16, designed using \"Z\". National never brought a chip to the market with the CompactRISC-32 core. National's Research department worked with the University of Michigan to develop the first synthesizable Verilog Model, and Verilog was used from the CR16C and onwards.\nOthers.\nVersions of the older NS32000 line for low-cost products such as the NS32CG16, NS32CG160, NS32FV16, NS32FX161, NS32FX164 and the NS32AM160/1/3, all based on the NS302CG16 were introduced from 1987 and onwards.\nThese processors had some success in the laser printer and fax market, despite intense competition from AMD and Intel RISC chips. Especially the NS32CG16 should be noted. The key difference between this and the NS32C016 is the integration of the expensive timing control unit (TCU) which generates the needed two-phase clock from a crystal, and the removal of the floating point coprocessor support, which freed up microcode space for the useful BitBLT instruction set, which significantly improves the performance in laser printer operations, making this 60,000 transistor chip faster than the 200,000 transistor MC68020. The NS32CG160 is the CG16 with timers and DMA peripherals, while the NS32FV/FX16x chips have extra DSP functionality on top of the CG16 BitBLT core for the fax and answering machine market. They are complemented by the NS32532 based NS32GX32 later. Unlike the previous chips, there was no extra hardware. The NS32GX32 is the NS32532 without the MMU sold at an attractive price for embedded system. In the beginning, this was just a remarked chip. It is unclear if the chip was redesigned for lower-cost production.\nDatasheets exist for an NS32132, apparently designed for multiprocessor systems. This is the NS32032 extended with an arbiter. The bus usage of the NS32032 is about 50 percent, owing to its very compact instruction set, or its very slow pipeline as competitors would phrase it. Indeed, one suggested application of the NS32032 was as part of a \"fault-tolerant transaction system\" employing \"two 32032s in parallel and comparing results on alternate memory cycles to detect soft errors\". The NS32132 chip allows a pair of CPUs to be connected to the same memory system, without much change of the PCB. Prototype systems were built by Diab Data AB in Sweden, but did not perform as well as the single-CPU MC68020 system designed by the same company.\nLegacy.\nThe emergence of workstations based on microprocessors such as the Motorola 68000 encouraged Digital to contemplate introducing a low-end, 32-bit \"supermicro\" product. Prompted by \"an unsolicited proposal from a semiconductor manufacturer\", later identified as Zilog, seeking to develop a high-volume, high-performance chipset implementing a subset of the VAX architecture, Digital sought more capable semiconductor partners for such an effort without success. Although the company later pursued this effort alone, resulting in the MicroVAX architecture and product family, the lack of industry interest and concerns about resourcing led some in the program team to consider adopting the then-unreleased NS32032 and porting VMS in order to realise their original objective.\nIn June 2015, Udo M\u00f6ller released a complete Verilog implementation of an NS32000 processor on OpenCores. Fully software-compatible with an NS32532 CPU with N32381 FPU, it is significantly faster when implemented on an FPGA, both operating at a higher clock rate and using fewer cycles per instruction.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "35248", "revid": "50702454", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35248", "title": "2D computer graphics", "text": "Computer-based generation of digital images\n2D computer graphics is the computer-based generation of digital images\u2014mostly from two-dimensional models (such as 2D geometric models, text, and digital images) and by techniques specific to them. It may refer to the branch of computer science that comprises such techniques or to the models themselves.\n2D computer graphics are mainly used in applications that were originally developed upon traditional printing and drawing technologies, such as typography, cartography, technical drawing, advertising, etc. In those applications, the two-dimensional image is not just a representation of a real-world object, but an independent artifact with added semantic value; two-dimensional models are therefore preferred, because they give more direct control of the image than 3D computer graphics (whose approach is more akin to photography than to typography).\nIn many domains, such as desktop publishing, engineering, and business, a description of a document based on 2D computer graphics techniques can be much smaller than the corresponding digital image\u2014often by a factor of 1/1000 or more. This representation is also more flexible since it can be rendered at different resolutions to suit different output devices. For these reasons, documents and illustrations are often stored or transmitted as 2D graphic files.\n2D computer graphics started in the 1950s, based on vector graphics devices. These were largely supplanted by raster-based devices in the following decades. The PostScript language and the X Window System protocol were landmark developments in the field.\n2D graphics models may combine geometric models (also called vector graphics), digital images (also called raster graphics), text to be typeset (defined by content, font style and size, color, position, and orientation), mathematical functions and equations, and more. These components can be modified and manipulated by two-dimensional geometric transformations such as translation, rotation, and scaling.\nIn object-oriented graphics, the image is described indirectly by an object endowed with a self-rendering method\u2014a procedure that assigns colors to the image pixels by an arbitrary algorithm. Complex models can be built by combining simpler objects, in the paradigms of object-oriented programming.\nBackground (geometry).\nIn Euclidean geometry, a \"translation (geometry)\" moves every point a constant distance in a specified direction. A translation can be described as a rigid motion: other rigid motions include rotations and reflections. A translation can also be interpreted as the addition of a constant vector to every point, or as shifting the origin of the coordinate system. A \"translation operator\" is an operator formula_1 such that formula_2\nIf v is a fixed vector, then the translation \"T\"v will work as \"T\"v(p) = p + v.\nIf \"T\" is a translation, then the image of a subset \"A\" under the function \"T\" is the translation of \"A\" by \"T\". The translation of \"A\" by \"T\"v is often written \"A\" + v.\nIn a Euclidean space, any translation is an isometry. The set of all translations forms the translation group \"T\", which is isomorphic to the space itself, and a normal subgroup of Euclidean group \"E\"(\"n\" ). The quotient group of \"E\"(\"n\" ) by \"T\" is isomorphic to the orthogonal group \"O\"(\"n\" ):\n\"E\"(\"n\" ) \"/ T\" \u2245 \"O\"(\"n\" ).\nTranslation.\nSince a translation is an affine transformation but not a linear transformation, homogeneous coordinates are normally used to represent the translation operator by a matrix and thus to make it linear. Thus we write the 3-dimensional vector w = (\"w\"\"x\", \"w\"\"y\", \"w\"\"z\") using 4 homogeneous coordinates as w = (\"w\"\"x\", \"w\"\"y\", \"w\"\"z\", 1).\nTo translate an object by a vector v, each homogeneous vector p (written in homogeneous coordinates) would need to be multiplied by this translation matrix:\n formula_3\nAs shown below, the multiplication will give the expected result:\n formula_4\nThe inverse of a translation matrix can be obtained by reversing the direction of the vector:\n formula_5\nSimilarly, the product of translation matrices is given by adding the vectors:\n formula_6\nBecause addition of vectors is commutative, multiplication of translation matrices is therefore also commutative (unlike multiplication of arbitrary matrices).\nRotation.\nIn linear algebra, a \"rotation matrix\" is a matrix that is used to perform a rotation in Euclidean space.\nformula_7\nrotates points in the \"xy\"-Cartesian plane counterclockwise through an angle \"\u03b8\" about the origin of the Cartesian coordinate system. To perform the rotation using a rotation matrix \"R\", the position of each point must be represented by a column vector v, containing the coordinates of the point. A rotated vector is obtained by using the matrix multiplication \"R\"v. Since matrix multiplication has no effect on the zero vector (i.e., on the coordinates of the origin), rotation matrices can only be used to describe rotations about the origin of the coordinate system.\nRotation matrices provide a simple algebraic description of such rotations, and are used extensively for computations in geometry, physics, and computer graphics. In 2-dimensional space, a rotation can be simply described by an angle \"\u03b8\" of rotation, but it can be also represented by the 4 entries of a rotation matrix with 2 rows and 2 columns. In 3-dimensional space, every rotation can be interpreted as a rotation by a given angle about a single fixed axis of rotation (see Euler's rotation theorem), and hence it can be simply described by an angle and a vector with 3 entries. However, it can also be represented by the 9 entries of a rotation matrix with 3 rows and 3 columns. The notion of rotation is not commonly used in dimensions higher than\u00a03; there is a notion of a \"rotational displacement\", which can be represented by a matrix, but no associated single axis or angle.\nRotation matrices are square matrices, with real entries. More specifically they can be characterized as orthogonal matrices with determinant\u00a01:\nformula_8.\nThe set of all such matrices of size \"n\" forms a group, known as the special orthogonal group SO(\"n\").\nIn two dimensions.\nIn two dimensions every rotation matrix has the following form:\nformula_9.\nThis rotates column vectors by means of the following matrix multiplication:\nformula_10.\nSo the coordinates (x',y') of the point (x,y) after rotation are:\nformula_11,\nformula_12.\nThe direction of vector rotation is counterclockwise if \u03b8 is positive (e.g. 90\u00b0), and clockwise if \u03b8 is negative (e.g. -90\u00b0).\nformula_13.\nNon-standard orientation of the coordinate system.\nIf a standard right-handed Cartesian coordinate system is used, with the \"x\" axis to the right and the \"y\" axis up, the rotation R(\"\u03b8\") is counterclockwise. If a left-handed Cartesian coordinate system is used, with \"x\" directed to the right but \"y\" directed down, R(\"\u03b8\") is clockwise. Such non-standard orientations are rarely used in mathematics but are common in 2D computer graphics, which often have the origin in the top left corner and the \"y\"-axis down the screen or page.\nSee below for other alternative conventions which may change the sense of the rotation produced by a rotation matrix.\nCommon rotations.\nParticularly useful are the matrices for 90\u00b0 and 180\u00b0 rotations:\nformula_14 (90\u00b0 counterclockwise rotation)\nformula_15 (180\u00b0 rotation in either direction \u2013 a half-turn)\nformula_16 (270\u00b0 counterclockwise rotation, the same as a 90\u00b0 clockwise rotation)\nScaling.\nIn Euclidean geometry, uniform scaling (isotropic scaling, homogeneous dilation, homothety) is a linear transformation that enlarges (increases) or shrinks (diminishes) objects by a scale factor that is the same in all directions. The result of uniform scaling is similar (in the geometric sense) to the original. A scale factor of 1 is normally allowed, so that congruent shapes are also classed as similar. (Some school text books specifically exclude this possibility, just as some exclude squares from being rectangles or circles from being ellipses.)\nMore general is scaling with a separate scale factor for each axis direction. Non-uniform scaling (anisotropic scaling, inhomogeneous dilation) is obtained when at least one of the scaling factors is different from the others; a special case is directional scaling or stretching (in one direction). Non-uniform scaling changes the shape of the object; e.g. a square may change into a rectangle, or into a parallelogram if the sides of the square are not parallel to the scaling axes (the angles between lines parallel to the axes are preserved, but not all angles).\nA scaling can be represented by a scaling matrix. To scale an object by a vector \"v\" = (\"vx, vy, vz\"), each point \"p\" = (\"px, py, pz\") would need to be multiplied with this scaling matrix:\nformula_17\nAs shown below, the multiplication will give the expected result:\nformula_18\nSuch a scaling changes the diameter of an object by a factor between the scale factors, the area by a factor between the smallest and the largest product of two scale factors, and the volume by the product of all three.\nThe scaling is uniform if and only if the scaling factors are equal (\"vx = vy = vz\"). If all except one of the scale factors are equal to 1, we have directional scaling.\nIn the case where \"vx = vy = vz = k\", the scaling is also called an enlargement or dilation by a factor k, increasing the area by a factor of k2 and the volume by a factor of k3.\nScaling in the most general sense is any affine transformation with a diagonalizable matrix. It includes the case that the three directions of scaling are not perpendicular. It includes also the case that one or more scale factors are equal to zero (projection), and the case of one or more negative scale factors. The latter corresponds to a combination of scaling proper and a kind of reflection: along lines in a particular direction we take the reflection in the point of intersection with a plane that need not be perpendicular; therefore it is more general than ordinary reflection in the plane.\nUsing homogeneous coordinates.\nIn projective geometry, often used in computer graphics, points are represented using homogeneous coordinates. To scale an object by a vector \"v\" = (\"vx, vy, vz\"), each homogeneous coordinate vector \"p\" = (\"px, py, pz\", 1) would need to be multiplied with this projective transformation matrix:\nformula_19\nAs shown below, the multiplication will give the expected result:\nformula_20\nSince the last component of a homogeneous coordinate can be viewed as the denominator of the other three components, a uniform scaling by a common factor \"s\" (uniform scaling) can be accomplished by using this scaling matrix:\nformula_21\nFor each vector \"p\" = (\"px, py, pz\", 1) we would have\nformula_22\nwhich would be homogenized to\nformula_23\nTechniques.\nDirect painting.\nA convenient way to create a complex image is to start with a blank \"canvas\" raster map (an array of pixels, also known as a bitmap) filled with some uniform background color and then \"draw\", \"paint\" or \"paste\" simple patches of color onto it, in an appropriate order. In particular the canvas may be the frame buffer for a computer display.\nSome programs will set the pixel colors directly, but most will rely on some 2D graphics library or the machine's graphics card, which usually implement the following operations:\nExtended color models.\nText, shapes and lines are rendered with a client-specified color. Many libraries and cards provide color gradients, which are handy for the generation of smoothly-varying backgrounds, shadow effects, etc. (See also Gouraud shading). The pixel colors can also be taken from a texture, e.g. a digital image (thus emulating rub-on screentones and the fabled \"checker paint\" which used to be available only in cartoons).\nPainting a pixel with a given color usually replaces its previous color. However, many systems support painting with transparent and translucent colors, which only modify the previous pixel values. \nThe two colors may also be combined in more complex ways, e.g. by computing their bitwise exclusive or. This technique is known as \"inverting color\" or \"color inversion\", and is often used in graphical user interfaces for highlighting, rubber-band drawing, and other volatile painting\u2014since re-painting the same shapes with the same color will restore the original pixel values. \nLayers.\nThe models used in 2D computer graphics usually do not provide for three-dimensional shapes, or three-dimensional optical phenomena such as lighting, shadows, reflection, refraction, etc. However, they usually can model multiple \"layers\" (conceptually of ink, paper, or film; opaque, translucent, or transparent\u2014stacked in a specific order. The ordering is usually defined by a single number (the layer's \"depth\", or distance from the viewer).\nLayered models are sometimes called \"2&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442-D computer graphics\". They make it possible to mimic traditional drafting and printing techniques based on film and paper, such as cutting and pasting; and allow the user to edit any layer without affecting the others. For these reasons, they are used in most graphics editors. Layered models also allow better spatial anti-aliasing of complex drawings and provide a sound model for certain techniques such as \"mitered joints\" and the even\u2013odd rule.\nLayered models are also used to allow the user to suppress unwanted information when viewing or printing a document, e.g. roads or railways from a map, certain process layers from an integrated circuit diagram, or hand annotations from a business letter.\nIn a layer-based model, the target image is produced by \"painting\" or \"pasting\" each layer, in order of decreasing depth, on the virtual canvas. Conceptually, each layer is first rendered on its own, yielding a digital image with the desired resolution which is then painted over the canvas, pixel by pixel. Fully transparent parts of a layer need not be rendered, of course. The rendering and painting may be done in parallel, i.e., each layer pixel may be painted on the canvas as soon as it is produced by the rendering procedure.\nLayers that consist of complex geometric objects (such as text or polylines) may be broken down into simpler elements (characters or line segments, respectively), which are then painted as separate layers, in some order. However, this solution may create undesirable aliasing artifacts wherever two elements overlap the same pixel.\nSee also Portable Document Format#Layers.\nHardware.\nModern computer graphics card displays almost overwhelmingly use raster techniques, dividing the screen into a rectangular grid of pixels, due to the relatively low cost of raster-based video hardware as compared with vector graphic hardware. Most graphic hardware has internal support for blitting operations or sprite drawing. A co-processor dedicated to blitting is known as a \"Blitter chip\".\nClassic 2D graphics chips and graphics processing units of the late 1970s to 1980s, used in 8-bit to early 16-bit, arcade games, video game consoles, and home computers, include:\nSoftware.\nMany graphical user interfaces (GUIs), including macOS, Microsoft Windows, or the X Window System, are primarily based on 2D graphical concepts. Such software provides a visual environment for interacting with the computer, and commonly includes some form of window manager to aid the user in conceptually distinguishing between different applications. \nThe user interface within individual software applications is typically 2D in nature as well, due in part to the fact that most common input devices, such as the mouse, are constrained to two dimensions of movement.\n2D graphics are very important in the control peripherals such as printers, plotters, sheet cutting machines, etc. They were also used in most early video games; and are still used for card and board games such as solitaire, chess, mahjongg, etc.\n2D graphics editors or \"drawing programs\" are application-level software for the creation of images, diagrams and illustrations by direct manipulation (through the mouse, graphics tablet, or similar device) of 2D computer graphics primitives. These editors generally provide geometric primitives as well as digital images; and some even support procedural models. The illustration is usually represented internally as a layered model, often with a hierarchical structure to make editing more convenient. These editors generally output graphics files where the layers and primitives are separately preserved in their original form. MacDraw, introduced in 1984 with the Macintosh line of computers, was an early example of this class; recent examples are the commercial products Adobe Illustrator and CorelDRAW, and the free editors such as xfig or Inkscape. There are also many 2D graphics editors specialized for certain types of drawings such as electrical, electronic and VLSI diagrams, topographic maps, computer fonts, etc.\nImage editors are specialized for the manipulation of digital images, mainly by means of free-hand drawing/painting and signal processing operations. They typically use a direct-painting paradigm, where the user controls virtual pens, brushes, and other free-hand artistic instruments to apply paint to a virtual canvas. Some image editors support a multiple-layer model; however, in order to support signal-processing operations like blurring each layer is normally represented as a digital image. Therefore, any geometric primitives that are provided by the editor are immediately converted to pixels and painted onto the canvas. The name \"raster graphics editor\" is sometimes used to contrast this approach to that of general editors which also handle \"vector graphics\". One of the first popular image editors was Apple's MacPaint, companion to MacDraw. Modern examples are the free GIMP editor, and the commercial products Photoshop and Paint Shop Pro. This class too includes many specialized editors\u2014for medicine, remote sensing, digital photography, etc.\nDevelopmental animation.\nWith the resurgence of 2D animation, free and proprietary software packages have become widely available for amateurs and professional animators. With software like RETAS UbiArt Framework and Adobe After Effects, coloring and compositing can be done in less time.\nVarious approaches have been developed to aid and speed up the process of digital 2D animation. For example, by generating vector artwork in a tool like Adobe Flash an artist may employ software-driven automatic coloring and in-betweening.\nPrograms like Blender or Adobe Substance allow the user to do either 3D animation, 2D animation or combine both in its software allowing experimentation with multiple forms of animation.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

During the middle of the decade, Jewish leader Simon bar Kokhba led a large-scale armed rebellion against the Romans in Judea, known as the Bar Kokhba revolt. This was the last of the major Jewish\u2013Roman wars. However, the revolt was quelled in 135 by the Romans and the rebels' Jewish state was destroyed. The Romans retook Jerusalem and named it Aelia Capitolina. The Romans also fought wars with the Alani and the Suebi tribes. \nIn 135, two major political changes occurred in Han China. Eunuch-marquesses began to be allowed to pass their marches to their adopted sons, and Liang Shang became the commander of the armed forces and effectively the most powerful individual in the imperial government. Neither of these developments appeared at the time to be major, but had great implications. The former demonstrated that the power of the eunuchs was becoming systemic, and the latter led to the start of the Liangs controlling the imperial government for several administrations. From 136 to 138, there were a number of native rebellions in various parts of southern China Jiaozhi. While these were generally put down with relative ease (in particular, the rebels generally surrendered willingly if the corrupt officials they were protesting against were replaced by Emperor Shun), these would foreshadow the much more serious rebellions that would come in the next few decades. \nIn Syria, the Temple of Baalshamin was built in Palmyra, which became rich after the city introduced tax laws for trade. \nFor science, Chinese astronomer and inventor Zhang Heng was also active during this period, inventing and presenting the first seismoscope in 132. \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The effects of the September 11 attacks of the previous year had a significant impact on the affairs of 2002. The war on terror was a major political focus. Without settled international law, several nations engaged in anti-terror operations, and human rights concerns arose surrounding the treatment of suspected terrorists. Elsewhere, the Colombian conflict and the Nepalese Civil War represented some of the most severe militant conflicts, while the conflict between India and Pakistan was the only one between two sovereign nations. Religious tensions permeated the year, including violence between Hindus and Muslims in India during violent riots and other attacks and attacks on Jews in response to the Second Intifada. The Catholic Church grappled with scrutiny amid sexual abuse cases.\nTimor-Leste was established as a new sovereign nation, and the African Union began operating as a new intergovernmental organization. The International Criminal Court was founded in July. The global economy was stagnant as it slowly moved past the early 2000s recession. South America endured an economic crisis, and the telecommunications and information technology industries faced their own economic declines. The Euro was introduced as a new currency at the beginning of the year.\nThe year 2002 was the second hottest on record at the time. Eruptions of Mount Nyiragongo severely affected surrounding populations in central Africa. The discovery of Quaoar in October challenged the conventional definition of a planet. Small RNA was discovered in 2002, and the human ancestor \"Sahelanthropus\" was first described.\nNorway won the most gold medals in the 2002 Winter Olympics, which were held in Salt Lake City. The popular film franchises \"Harry Potter\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\" saw continued success, with \"\" becoming the highest-grossing film of the year, while \"James Bond\" and \"Star Wars\" were less successful than other franchise installments. Pop music lost its popularity in 2002 amid the rise of country and hip hop, with hip hop artist Eminem producing the year's most successful album, \"The Eminem Show\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPopulation.\nThe world population on January 1, 2002, was estimated to be 6.272\u00a0billion people, and it increased to 6.353\u00a0billion people by January 1, 2003. An estimated 134.0\u00a0million births and 52.5\u00a0million deaths took place in 2002. The average global life expectancy was 67.1 years, an increase of 0.3 years from 2001. The number of global refugees was approximately 12\u00a0million at the beginning of 2002, but it declined to 10.3\u00a0million by the end of the year. Approximately 2.4\u00a0million refugees were repatriated in 2002, of which 2\u00a0million were Afghan. 293,000 additional refugees were displaced in 2002, primarily from Liberia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi, Somalia, Ivory Coast, and the Central African Republic.\nConflicts.\nThere were 31 armed conflicts in 2002 that caused at least 25 fatalities. Five of these resulted in at least 1,000 fatalities: the Burundian Civil War, the Colombian conflict, the Kashmir insurgency, the Nepalese Civil War, and the Second Sudanese Civil War. Among developed nations in 2002, national defense shifted toward counterterrorism after the September 11 attacks and the invasion of Afghanistan the previous year. Conflicts in Afghanistan, Chechnya, Israel, and the Philippines were directly related to countering Islamic terrorism.87\nInternal conflicts.\nThe Colombian conflict escalated after far-left insurgents occupied demilitarized zones and kidnapped \u00cdngrid Betancourt, effectively ending peace talks. The insurgents began bombing cities, and over 200,000 Colombians were displaced by the conflict in 2002.\nThe Nepalese Civil War escalated in 2002, with casualties approximately equaling the combined totals from 1996 to 2001; half of this increase was civilian casualties, as civilians were targeted by both the Nepali government and the communist insurgents. Chechen insurgents in Russia escalated their attacks during the Second Chechen War, destroying a Russian Mil Mi-26 in August and causing a hostage crisis in Moscow. The Second Liberian Civil War also escalated, causing widespread displacement of civilians.90\nConflicts that saw some form of resolution in 2002 include the Eelam War III in Sri Lanka, which was halted with a ceasefire agreement in February,98 and the Angolan Civil War, which was resolved in April with a ceasefire between the Angolan government and UNITA.89 Internationally brokered peace talks advanced in the Second Sudanese Civil War,102 some factions of the Somali Civil War,106 and the Second Congo War, with the latter producing an agreement on December 17 to create a Congolese transitional government. Afghanistan underwent its first year without direct military conflict in over two decades, though sporadic attacks were carried out by the Taliban insurgency and al-Qaeda.256 An agreement was reached with the government of Burundi and the CNDD-FDD on December 3, but the other major faction in Burundi, the Palipehutu-FNL, did not participate in peace talks.\nThe largest attack on civilians in 2002 was a series of bombings in Bali that killed or injured hundreds on October 12, with Australian tourists making up a large portion of the victims.228 Major attacks also took place in Kenya on November 28, bombing Israeli citizens at a hotel and making a failed attempt to shoot down an airplane boarded by Israelis.385 The Washington D.C. area was the subject of several sniper attacks the same month, killing ten people. Europe underwent a large number of mass shootings throughout the year, including an attack on a town council meeting in France on March 27 that killed eight councilors and a school shooting in Germany on April 26\u2014one of the deadliest in the world with 18 fatalities.229\nInternational conflicts.\nThe only direct conflict between nations in 2002 was the India\u2013Pakistan standoff in Kashmir, beginning in late 2001. This conflict was primarily one of brinkmanship, with the threat of nuclear warfare.88 Riots in Gujarat and suicide bombings in Jammu further escalated tensions. However by June 2002 the conflict had ended.87\nThe Second Intifada continued in 2002 between the Israel Defense Forces and Palestinian paramilitary groups with an escalation in violence. Palestinian suicide bombings became coordinated to maximize the number of civilian casualties, while the Israeli military killed approximately twice as many Palestinians in retaliation.73 In response to the suicide bombings, Israel carried out Operation Defensive Shield in March.413 Under this operation, Israel occupied much of West Bank,413 and it and briefly held Palestinian president Yasser Arafat under house arrest.95 The Battle of Jenin was particularly destructive, with the United Nations finding both parties to be irresponsible regarding collateral damage.96\nCulture.\nArt and architecture.\nEconomic downturn in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks limited the art industry in 2002. Organizations were less willing to give patronage, and tourists were less willing to visit art exhibitions and museums, particularly in New York and the Middle East.502 The Documenta11 exhibition took place in Kassel, Germany, contributing to the early movement of art globalization with its focus on experimental and documentary works from developing nations. Traditional visual art was mostly replaced by film and photography at the exhibition.503 Critically acclaimed paintings in 2002 include \"The Upper Room\", a collection of paintings by Chris Ofili based on a drawing of a monkey by Andy Warhol, and \"Dispersion\", an abstract work by Julie Mehretu.\nThe rebuilding of the World Trade Center was a major focus in the architectural world, and various exhibitions were held to showcase design concepts. The Tribute in Light was implemented on the site during the interim.155 Egypt began accepting designs for the Grand Egyptian Museum.234 New structures constructed or opened in 2002 include the Austrian Cultural Forum in New York, the Imperial War Museum North in Manchester,156 the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels in Los Angeles, and the Bibliotheca Alexandrina in Alexandria.506 The Bronx Developmental Center in New York and Fallingwater in Pennsylvania were renovated, and the Maslon House was demolished in California.157\nMedia.\nPopular media.\nThe highest-grossing film globally in 2002 was ', followed by \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\" and \"Spider-Man\". The highest-grossing non-English film was \"Hero\" (Mandarin), the 28th highest-grossing film of the year. Film was marked by several unexpected successes and failures in 2002, including the underwhelming performances of the \"Star Wars\" film ', the \"James Bond\" film \"Die Another Day\", and the Disney film \"Treasure Planet\", as well as the word-of-mouth success of \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\". Critically acclaimed films from 2002 include \"Adaptation\",\"\" \"Far from Heaven\",\"\" and \"Talk to Her\".\"\"\nMusic sales in 2002 amounted to about 3 billion units, a decline of 8% from 2001. CD albums remained the dominant form of music, making up 89% of the market. DVD music sales increased by 40%, while cassette tape music sales decreased by 36%. Pop music saw a major decline in 2002 as it was overtaken by country and hip hop music. Globally, the best-selling albums in 2002 were \"The Eminem Show\" by Eminem, followed by \"Let Go\" by Avril Lavigne and the Elvis Presley greatest hits album . The best-selling non-English album was \"Mensch\" (transl.\u2009Human) by German singer Herbert Gr\u00f6nemeyer, the 29th best-selling album overall.\nSony and Microsoft introduced online gaming services for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox consoles, respectively.174 Critically acclaimed video games released in 2002 include \"Eternal Darkness\", ', \"Metroid Prime\", \"Metroid Fusion\", and \"Super Mario Sunshine\". ' was influential in the war-based first-person shooter genre with its portrayal of grand cinematic battles. 2002 was the final year of traditional survival horror before it was overtaken by action-based survival horror games in franchises such as \"Resident Evil\".\nLibraries, press, and radio.\nCosta Rica was celebrated for an advance in free speech when it abolished criminal penalties for insulting public officials.275 Radio in India became more popular in 2002 following deregulation, with five major stations in Mumbai breaking the state monopoly in April and with significant increases in the sales of car and pocket radios. \"Good Morning Afghanistan\" began airing to provide the Afghan people real-time updates on the nation's political situation, while Radio Liberty was expelled from Russia in October.272 An expected recovery of the newspaper industry did not materialize in 2002 as digital media became more common, resulting in significant cutbacks.273 The magazine industry faced similar challenges, as well as a separate controversy when the February 11 issue of \"Newsweek International\" was banned throughout the Muslim world for its depiction of Muhammed.275\nThe British Library digitized a 700-year-old edition of the Quran, and the U.S. Library of Congress made high resolution scans of a Gutenberg Bible for closer study of Gutenberg's printing methods. Library services faced multiple disruptions in 2002. Strikes by librarians affected operations in both the United Kingdom and the United States, while funding shortages led to cutbacks in Germany, South Africa, and the United States.233\nSports.\nThe 2002 Winter Olympics were held in Salt Lake City, with Norway winning the most gold medals. Allegations that a judge was bribed to favor Russia in a figure skating event led to Canada and Russia both receiving gold medals in the event.515 The 2002 Commonwealth Games were held in Manchester.516 The 2002 FIFA World Cup was held in Japan and South Korea, and it ended with a 2\u20130 victory by Brazil over Germany. The traditionally well-performing teams of Argentina, France, and Italy did not meet expectations, while Senegal, South Korea, Turkey, and the United States performed better than they had historically.513\nMichael Schumacher significantly exceeded his competition and set numerous records with the Ferrari F2002 during the 2002 Formula One World Championship, prompting the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile to make several rule changes; this included reforms for team orders following a controversial move at the 2002 Austrian Grand Prix in which Schumacher's teammate Rubens Barrichello moved aside to let him win.317 In boxing, the Lennox Lewis vs. Mike Tyson was preceded by a scuffle during a press conference. Lennox Lewis went on to defeat Mike Tyson.520 Tennis was widely covered in 2002 when three of the four Grand Slam tournaments ended with Serena Williams defeating her sister Venus Williams in the finals.352 In American football, the Tuck Rule Game between the New England Patriots and the Oakland Raiders became a national controversy after officials cited the obscure tuck rule to challenge a pass by Tom Brady. The New Zealand All Blacks received wide attention in rugby union for its victory in the 2002 Tri Nations Series, making a comeback performance following its losses in previous years.340 Bruno Peyron set the record for the fastest circumnavigation by sailing in 2002, making the trip in 64 days.521\nEconomy.\nInternational trade increased by 1.9% in 2002, recovering from a decrease in 2001.11 Most countries experienced only limited growth of output and employment in the year, and economic policy within the largest economies focused primarily on combating inflation.1 The gross world product increased by 1.7%, the second lowest growth in a decade after that of 2001.2 Most developed nations began 2002 in a budget surplus and ended in a deficit.8 The Euro, a single official currency for the nations of the European Union, was introduced on January 1.6\nThe early 2000s recession began to stabilize in the final months of the year.1 Growth was focused in the first half of the year before tapering in the second half35 as stock markets entered into a downturn. By October, global equities saw a 24% decrease in 2002.185 Particularly affected was AOL-Time Warner, with its stocks losing 65% of their value by the fall.100 The information technology industry in particular saw major decline in 2002170 before it began its recovery from the dot-com crash that had previously affected it.458 The telecommunications industry was affected even more severely.176\nThe price drops associated with the September 11 attacks persisted for several months into 2002.7 Apprehensions about potential military conflict in Iraq also limited growth.185 Latin American economies with large deficits were severely affected by lower prices, limiting export growth and preventing capital from entering the region, requiring further increases to the deficit.3 The region overall saw a negative GDP in 2002.4 Imports grew significantly in East Asia, with China competing with the United States as one of the largest export markets for other countries in the region.12 Imports in Latin America and Africa decreased compared to the previous year.13\nThe United States recovered in part from the recession that had affected the Western world, while Europe's recovery was more limited.10 South America saw significant economic challenges: Argentina's economic crisis continued from 2001, Brazil had low confidence in its economy, and Venezuela's economy suffered amid political upheaval.13 Unlike the Western world, Eastern Europe and Asia showed strong growth in 2002.11 Africa did not share this growth, as it also experienced a weak economy during the year.14\nSeveral companies, predominantly in the United States, underwent major scandals in 2002. These included the WorldCom scandal that led to what was then the largest bankruptcy in American history, and accounting scandals emerging from the previous year's Enron scandal. Xerox and the French company Vivendi were found to be reporting artificially inflated profits.186 Others incidents included the ImClone stock trading case and fraud cases at Adelphia and Tyco. These scandals brought the arrests of several high-profile executives, negatively affected public trust in corporate accounting,185 and increased the volatility of global stock markets.186\nEnvironment and weather.\n2002 was the second hottest year on record, exceeded only by 1998. There was below average precipitation in 2002, with droughts in Australia, northern China, India, and Western United States. Heavy rains in late 2002 caused significant flooding in eastern Asia and in central Europe.77 The effects of the Asian brown cloud were documented in August by the United Nations Environment Programme, warning of severe agricultural and meteorological effects in Afghanistan, northwestern India, and Pakistan.184 February saw the collapse of the Larsen B ice shelf, a 12,000-year-old ice shelf in Antarctica with an area of 3,265\u00a0km2 (1,260 sq mi).387\nThe third Global Environment Outlook report was published in May.465 The World Summit on Sustainable Development was held in Johannesburg beginning on August 26. A number of proposals were endorsed in the summit, though environmentalists criticized the United States for not supporting stronger measures.209 The European Union ratified the Kyoto Protocol, while China and Russia announced their intent to do so. Australia and the United States rejected the protocol.211 The war in Afghanistan caused widespread environmental issues, with forests destroyed, wildlife poached by refugees,213 and the Kabul Zoo requiring international support.215 Kitulo National Park was established in Tanzania to preserve the endemic orchid species.239\nEfforts to promote carbon sequestration were mixed in 2002. An experiment to study whether there were risks of pollution was shuttered following pressure from environmentalist groups such as Greenpeace and the World Wide Fund for Nature, but Statoil reported success in a six-year-long experiment in the North Sea later in the year.212\nThe January eruption of Mount Nyiragongo brought destruction to Goma, prompting an evacuation of 400,000 people, with 12,000 finding themselves homeless with damage across 14 villages.182 A major oil spill took place off the coast of Galicia, Spain, when the MV \"Prestige\" ruptured and sank in November.87 The deadliest earthquake in 2002 was a 6.1-magnitude earthquake that struck northern Afghanistan on March 25, killing approximately 1,000 people. A 6.5 magnitude earthquake in Iran killed approximately 200 people the following June.182 North America saw one of its most intense earthquakes when a 7.9 magnitude earthquake struck Alaska on November 3, but the remote location prevented any fatalities.181\nThe 2002 Atlantic hurricane season saw 12 named storms, a near-average number. Most of them were relatively minor, with only 4 four becoming hurricanes, of which two attained major hurricane status. The season's activity was limited to between July and October, a rare occurrence caused partly by El Ni\u00f1o conditions. The two major hurricanes, Hurricane Isidore and Hurricane Lili, both made landfall in Cuba and the United States, and combined were responsible for most of the season's damages and deaths. The 2002 Pacific typhoon season entailed a typical number of typhoons, but they were above average in intensity with 46% of typhoons reaching \"intense strength\". Typhoon Rusa killed at least 113 people in South Korea, making it the nation's deadliest typhoon in 43 years.\nHealth.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recognized \"reducing risks\" and \"promoting healthy life\" as its health concern of focus in the 2002 World Health Report. Global food supplies reduced in 2002 amid droughts and drops in harvest yields.146 Famines occurred in Ethiopia, Malawi, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.6 Eritrea, Lesotho, Mozambique, and Swaziland were also heavily affected by insufficient food.146 The fishing industry was not affected, increasing slightly from previous years.149 Nigeria and the Philippines took steps toward establishing national healthcare systems.311\nA 2001 Ebola outbreak in Gabon and the Republic of the Congo continued through 2002.221 The United States and the Dutch company Crucell collaborated to begin development on an Ebola vaccine in response.222 The year's increased focus on terrorism, particularly after the 2001 anthrax attacks, prompted many countries to invest in vaccines, antibiotics, and antivirals as a precaution against bioterrorism.221 Renewed attention was brought to the case of family doctor Harold Shipman when it was announced in July that he had killed 200 other people under his care beyond the 15 for which he was prosecuted.232\nPolitics and law.\nEast Timor became a sovereign nation in 2002.1 It was one of two nations, along with Switzerland, to join the United Nations in September.382 Brazil, Lesotho, and Senegal established democracy in 2002 through the acceptance of fair elections, while Bahrain and Kenya moved toward democracy through the strengthening of political institutions. Democracy was disestablished in Ivory Coast and Togo following mass political violence and unfair elections, respectively.14\nThe United States was not reelected to its membership on the United Nations Commission on Human Rights for the first time.381 Afghanistan underwent significant liberalization under a transitional government following end of major fighting in the War in Afghanistan, particularly in the capital of Kabul, though distant regions of the country remained oppressed by warlords.15 Civil rights also increased following the end of conflicts in Angola, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Macedonia. Turkey lessened its restrictions on the country's Kurdish population in 2002.16 The majority of Gibraltar's population engaged in protests when the British government considered delivering partial control of the territory to Spain; this culminated with a referendum that rejected the move.385\nThe Chinese Communist Party chose Hu Jintao as its next leader in a November meeting.87 The African Union formally came into existence in July.7 The United Kingdom held a Golden Jubilee celebration for Queen Elizabeth II, marking fifty years as the monarch.78 In Latin America, the great depression in Argentina continued into 2002, causing significant political turmoil. Venezuela also underwent political crisis with an attempted coup against President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in April and a national strike against his administration later in the year. Brazil elected the leftist president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva in response to the economic instability.86\nNATO established a diplomatic relationship with Russia through the NATO-Russia Council in May, and NATO announced seven new members in November: Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia. This expansion meant that NATO countries bordered Russia for the first time.282 Russia and the United States signed the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty nuclear disarmament agreement in May, but the United States left the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty the following month, and Russia then left the START II treaty. The International Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile Proliferation was signed by over 90 countries in November.277\nA wave of social pension reform took place in European nations, where Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Lithuania, Russia, Slovakia, Spain, were all in various phases of implementation. Similar reforms occurred in Japan and Singapore. Anti-globalization protests took place during the September World Bank\u2013IMF meeting in Washington, D.C.314\nCrime and international law.\nThe Rome Statute entered into force in July, establishing the International Criminal Court.469 The International Court of Justice ruled in three cases: it ruled that diplomatic immunity applied to all crimes, including crimes against humanity, and it settled two territorial disputes, ruling in favor of Cameroon over Nigeria and in favor of Malaysia over Indonesia. A lesser court was established by the United Nations in Sierra Leone to prosecute figures associated with the nation's civil war.470 A ban on the use of child soldiers was established in international law in February.381\nThe prosecution of former Yugoslavian president Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 began in February,225 but it was delayed and the genocide portion of the charges against him was dropped.86 Biljana Plav\u0161i\u0107, the former president of Republika Srpska, plead guilty to crimes against humanity in a related case.225 In August, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda saw the arrests of nine more people accused of genocide, including army chief of staff Augustin Bizimungu. Efforts failed to create a similar tribunal in Cambodia to prosecute Khmer Rouge.226 United Nations peacekeeping missions concluded in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Prevlaka, reducing its Balkan presence to Kosovo.381\nFormer military dictator of Argentina Leopoldo Galtieri was arrested in July for his actions in the Dirty War. Two generals from the Salvadoran Civil War were found liable for torture in an American court, and they were ordered to pay $54.6 million in damages.282 A major espionage case in the United States ended in May with Robert Hanssen sentenced to life in prison for spying on behalf of the Soviet Union.232 Serbia and Montenegro abolished capital punishment to qualify for entry to the Council of Europe, and Turkey did so to garner support for its incorporation into the European Union. Prisoners in Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Turkey engaged in deadly strikes and riots in response to poor conditions in 2002.232\nWar on terror.\nTerrorism dominated politics internationally in 2002, with both terrorist acts and attempts to declare groups as terrorist organizations being prevalent throughout the year. Islamic terrorism was widely seen as responsible for terrorist attacks throughout the year. In response, the United States began providing military assistance against terrorists in several countries as part of Operation Enduring Freedom.2 International law regarding these actions had yet to be settled, and international organizations spent the year debating how action against terrorist groups should be carried out.469\nPakistan arrested al-Qaeda operative Ramzi bin al-Shibh in September on suspicions of involvement in the September 11 attacks and extradited him to the United States. The United States arrested an addition fifteen suspects across several states for involvement in the preparation of future terrorist attacks.228 Anti-terrorism actions by the United States, including the arbitrary arrest and deportation of non-citizens and indefinite detention of suspected terrorists captured in Afghanistan, were condemned as human rights violations.314 American treatment of prisoners in the war on terror came under scrutiny, particularly in Camp X-Ray in the Guantanamo Bay detention camp.232 China and Russia invoked anti-terrorism to take actions against their Uyghur and Chechen minorities, respectively.315\nAustralia, Russia, and the United States all declared a right to preemptive strikes against foreign terrorist groups in 2002.278 George W. Bush defined an \"axis of evil\" in an address in January, naming Iran, Iraq, and North Korea as foreign adversaries of the United States. Increasing tensions between Iraq and the United States became a major geopolitical issue in 2002 amid suspicions that Iraq had resumed its production of weapons of mass destruction. The United Nations delivered an ultimatum for Iraq to comply with weapons inspections in late 2002. Because of this dispute, as well Hussein's involvement with terrorist groups amid the war on terror, an invasion of Iraq by the United States was widely expected.\nReligion.\nReligious violence was prevalent in 2002. Hindu\u2013Muslim relations were strained in India, most prominently by an attack on a Hindu train car in February that led to weeks of deadly riots in Gujarat. Unrest from the Second Intifada led to widespread attacks on Jews throughout the world, and Christians in Pakistan faced several attacks throughout the year.301\nThe Catholic Church sexual abuse scandal continued from 2001; the church adopted rules on how to address sexual abuse allegations on January 8, and Pope John Paul II made his second papal statement on the matter on March 22.448 The Catholic Church created four new Russian dioceses in February, resulting in protests by members of the Russian Orthodox Church.302 Belarus made the Belarusian Orthodox Church into the state's legally recognized religion, curtailing practice of other religions.449 The Church of England determined in July that divorcees could marry in the church. Then in December, the church saw its first leader in centuries from outside its own membership when the Welsh Rowan Williams was confirmed as Archbishop of Canterbury.447\nIslam grappled with the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in 2002, facing both the expansion of Islamic terrorism and of United States military action in combating it.450 Orthodox Judaism was the subject of several disputes with the Israeli government throughout the year, including the exemption of Orthodox Jews from military service and recognition of non-Orthodox conversions in the population registry.303\nThe relationship between religion and education shifted in several nations in 2002. The removal of the Taliban from power allowed girls to attend school in Afghanistan for the first time, and textbooks funded by the United States included images of women. Pakistan introduced a law to regulate Islamic madrasa schools under pressure from Western nations, but it saw backlash from the schools. State-funded faith schools became a polarizing issue when the government suggested increasing their number. The Supreme Court of the United States ruled that school vouchers allowed students to seek religious education.\nScience.\nArcheological finds in 2002 included the alleged ossuary of James, brother of Jesus; red ochre cave art in the Blombos Cave in South Africa, created approximately 77,000 years ago and the oldest known artwork; the largest Etruscan civilization settlement found to date, from approximately 2,600 years ago; a collection of bamboo slips featuring 200,000 characters of calligraphy from the Qin dynasty; two stone slabs featuring the Indian emperor Ashoka; ancient irrigation canals under Tucson, Arizona; a Mayan mural in San Bartolo, Guatemala; an Aztec shrine on Pico de Orizaba in Mexico; and the Palace of Parliament of Upper Canada that had been destroyed in the War of 1812. A major study published in 2002 provided evidence against the Black Sea deluge hypothesis that had been popularized in 1996.180 The Egyptian Museum held an exhibition for artifacts from the tomb of Tutankhamun, including some items never seen by the public.234\nChemists in 2002 bonded uranium to noble gases for the first time, observed a blackberry-shaped molecular structure in molybdenum blue, fluorinated carbon nanotubes, synthesized a stable cyclopentadienyl cation, discovered the oxidation-resistant gold Au55, incorporated a photonic lattice into a tungsten filament, invented the ITQ-21 zeolite to more efficiently refine petroleum, and developed a method to create crystalline oxide film without extreme heat.

The company was co-founded in 1979 by Robert Metcalfe, Howard Charney and others. Bill Krause joined as President in 1981. Metcalfe explained the name 3Com was a contraction of \"Computer Communication Compatibility\", with its focus on Ethernet technology that he had co-invented, which enabled the networking of computers.\n3Com provided network interface controller and switches, routers, wireless access points and controllers, IP voice systems, and intrusion prevention systems. The company was based in Santa Clara, California. From its 2007 acquisition of 100 percent ownership of H3C Technologies Co., Limited (H3C)\u00a0\u2014initially a joint venture with China-based Huawei Technologies\u20143Com achieved a market presence in China, and also sold products in Europe, Asia, and the Americas. 3Com products were sold under the brands 3Com, H3C, and TippingPoint.\nOn April 12, 2010, Hewlett-Packard completed the acquisition of 3Com. It was merged into HPE's Aruba Networks business unit following HP's acquisition of Aruba in 2015 and subsequent split into HPE later that same year.\nHistory.\nXerox PARC (1972\u20131979).\nAfter reading an article on ALOHAnet, Robert Metcalfe became interested in computer networking. ALOHAnet was an over-the-air wide area network system in Hawaii using ultra high frequency radios and made several assumptions that Metcalfe thought would not be correct in practice. He developed his own theories of how to manage traffic, and began to consider an \"ALOHAnet in a wire\" networking system. In 1972, he joined Xerox PARC to develop these ideas, and after pairing up with David Boggs, the two had early 3\u00a0Mbit/s versions of Ethernet working in 1973. They then went on to build up a networking protocol known as PARC Universal Packet (PuP), with the entire system ready for build-out by late 1974.\nAt this point, Xerox management did nothing with it, even after being approached by prospective customers. Increasingly upset by management's lack of interest, Metcalfe left Xerox in 1975, but he was lured back again the next year. Further development followed, resulting in the seminal Xerox Network Systems (XNS) protocol, which was completed by 1978. Once again, Metcalfe found that management was unwilling to actually do anything with the product, and he threatened to leave and in 1979 he left the company.\nFounding and early days (1979\u20131996).\nMetcalfe subsequently co-founded 3Com in 1979. The other co-founders were Metcalfe's college friend Howard Charney and two others. Bill Krause joined as President in 1981 and became CEO in 1982 and led 3Com until 1992 when he retired. 3Com began making Ethernet adapter cards for many early 1980s computer systems, including the DEC LSI-11, DEC VAX-11, Sun-2 and the IBM PC. In the mid-1980s, 3Com branded their Ethernet technology as EtherSeries, while introducing a range of software and PC-based equipment to provide shared services over a local area network (LAN) using XNS protocols. These protocols were branded EtherShare (for file sharing), EtherPrint (for printing), EtherMail (for email), and Ether-3270 (for IBM host emulation). 3Com became a public company via an initial public offering (IPO) in 1984.\nThe company's network software products included:\n3Com's expansion beyond its original base of PC and thin Ethernet products began in 1987 when it merged with Bridge Communications. This provided a range of equipment based on Motorola 68000 processors and using XNS protocols compatibly with 3Com's Etherterm PC software.\nBy 1995, 3Com's status was such that they were able to enter into an agreement with the city of San Francisco to pay $900,000 per year for the naming rights to Candlestick Park. That agreement ended in 2002.\n1997\u20132000.\nIn 1997, 3Com merged with USRobotics (USR), a maker of dial-up modems, and owner of Palm, Inc. USRobotics was known for its Sportster line of consumer-oriented modems, as well as its Courier business-class modem line. This merger spelled the beginning of the end of 3Com. In addition to consumer network electronics, USRobotics was a well-known manufacturer of a dialup access server, the \"Total Control Hub\", rebadged by 3Com as the \"Total Control 1000\", based largely on its Courier modem technology. This key business product competed against Cisco's AS5200 access server line in the mid-1990s as the explosion of the Internet led to service provider investment in dialup access server equipment. 3Com continued the development of the Total Control line until it was eventually spun off as a part of Commworks, which was then acquired by UTStarcom.\nIn August 1998, Bruce Claflin was named chief operating officer. The modem business was rapidly shrinking. 3Com attempted to enter the DSL business, but was not successful.\nIn the lucrative server network interface controller (NIC) business, 3Com dominated market share, with Intel only able to break past 3Com after dramatic price slashing. It started developing Gigabit Ethernet cards in-house but later scrapped the plans. Later, it formed a joint venture with Broadcom, where Broadcom would develop the main integrated circuit component and the NIC would be 3Com branded.\nIn 1999, 3Com acquired NBX, a Boston company with an Ethernet-based phone system for small and medium-sized businesses. This product proved popular with 3Com's existing distribution channel and saw rapid growth and adoption. As one of the first companies to deliver a complete networked phone system, and increased its distribution channel with larger telephony partners such as Southwestern Bell and Metropark Communications, 3Com helped make VoIP into a safe and practical technology with wide adoption.\n3Com then tried to move into the smart consumer appliances business and in June 2000, 3Com acquired internet radio startup Kerbango for $80 million. It developed its Audrey appliance, which made an appearance on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\". It scrapped the Audrey and Kerbango products less than a year later.\nIn March 2000, in a highly public and criticized move, 3Com exited the high-end core routers and switch market to focus on other areas of the business. The CoreBuilder Ethernet and ATM LAN switches, PathBuilder and NetBuilder WAN Routers were all discontinued June 2000. CoreBuilder products and the customer base was migrated over to Extreme Networks. The PathBuilder and NetBuilder were transitioned to Motorola. 3Com focused its efforts from 2000 to 2003 on building up the HomeConnect, OfficeConnect, SuperStack, NBX and Total Control product lines. Due to this perceived exit from the Enterprise market, 3Com would never gain momentum with large customers or carriers again.\nIn July 2000, 3Com spun off Palm as an independent company. Following Palm's IPO, 3Com continued to own 80percent of Palm, but 3Com's market capitalization was smaller than Palm's. U.S. Robotics was also spun out again as a separate company at this time.\n2001 and beyond.\nIn January 2001, Claflin became chief executive officer, replacing \u00c9ric Benhamou, CEO from 1990 to 2000. He was criticized for the costly diversification in the mobile handheld computer market.\nAt this point, the company's main line of business, selling add-on network interface controllers (\"NICs\"), was also shrinking rapidly, mainly because many new computers had NICs built in. The company started slashing or selling divisions and going through numerous rounds of layoffs. The company went from employing more than 12,000 employees to fewer than 2,000.\nIn May 2003, the company moved its Silicon Valley Santa Clara headquarters to Marlborough, Massachusetts. It also formed a venture called H3C with Huawei, whereby 3Com would sell and rebrand products under the joint venture.\nIn 2003, 3Com sold its CommWorks Corporation subsidiary to UTStarcom, Inc. CommWorks was based in Rolling Meadows, Illinois, and developed wireline telecommunications and wireless infrastructure technologies.\nIn January 2006, Claflin announced he would be leaving the company. In January 2006, R Scott Murray became CEO of 3Com and chairman of H3C Technology in China, the joint venture with Huawei Technologies. Murray voluntarily resigned from the company in August 2006 over his concerns about the questionable business ethics of Huawei and potential cyber security risks posed by Huawei. Edgar Masri returned to 3Com to head as president and CEO following Murray's departure.\nIn September 2007, Bain Capital agreed to buy the company for $2.2 billion, with minority equity financing from Huawei Technologies. However, the deal met with US government regulatory opposition and it fell through early in 2008, following concerns over Huawei's risk of conducting cyber security attacks against the United States and its allies, Huawei's former dealings in Iran, and Huawei being operated by a former engineer in China's People's Liberation Army. Edgar Masri left the company in April 2008, partially as a result of the failed Bain transaction.\nIn April 2008, Robert Mao was named chief executive, and Ron Sege president and chief operating officer.\nIn fiscal year 2008 ended May 30, 2008, 3Com had annual revenue of $1.3 billion and more than 6,000 employees in over 40 countries. In September 2008, 3Com reported financial results for its fiscal 2009 first quarter, which ended August 29, 2008. Revenue in the quarter was $342.7 million compared to revenue of $319.4 million in the corresponding period in fiscal 2008, a 7 percent increase. Net income in the quarter was $79.8 million, compared with a net loss of $18.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008.\nThe company reported that it had more than 2,700 engineers, with more than 1,400 United States patents and nearly 180 Chinese-issued patents, as well as more than 1050 pending Chinese applications. It also reported pending applications for 35 separate inventions outside of China covering a wide range of networking technologies.\nAcquisition by HP.\nOn November 11, 2009, 3Com and Hewlett-Packard announced that Hewlett-Packard would acquire 3Com for $2.7 billion in cash. On April 12, 2010, Hewlett-Packard completed its acquisition. When Hewlett-Packard split into Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc., the 3Com unit continued with HPE and was ultimately integrated into Aruba Networks along with the rest of HP's networking portfolio.\nProducts.\nAcquisitions.\n3Com came close to merging with computer maker Convergent Technologies, abandoning the pact just two days before a vote was scheduled in March 1986. Later, 3Com went on to acquire the following:\nFormer subsidiaries.\nCommWorks Corporation was a subsidiary of 3Com Corporation, based in Rolling Meadows, Illinois. It was sold to UTStarcom of Alameda, California in 2003.\nCommWorks was formerly the Carrier Network Business unit of 3Com, comprising several acquired companies: U.S. Robotics (Rolling Meadows, Illinois), Call Technologies (Reston, Virginia), and LANsource (Toronto, Ontario, Canada). CommWorks was able to use technology from each company to create IP softswitch and IP communications software. U.S. Robotics provided media gateways (the Total Control 1000 product line, formerly used for dial-modem termination) and softswitch technology. Call Technologies provided Unified Messaging software. LANsource provided fax-over-IP software that was integrated with the Unified Messaging platform.\nThe Carrier Network Business unit of 3Com developed an Inter-working function technology that became the first and dominant 2G CDMA wireless data gateway product. In partnership with Unwired Planet (now Openwave) and Qualcomm Quicknet connect allowed for 6\u00a0second connect times versus modems connecting the call in approximately 30 seconds. This product was deployed in the United States, Japan, and Korea covering the 2G CDMA market sample carriers included Sprint. It led to follow on products that became core to CommWorks now UTStarcom offerings including the 2.5 and 3G packet data gateway products known as PDSN and Home Agents.\nCommWorks/3Com co-developed an H.323-based softswitch with AT&amp;T in 1998 for use in a \"transparent trunking\" application for AT&amp;T's residential long-distance customers. Long distance telephone calls were redirected from the LEC's ingress CLASS 5 switch to the Total Control 1000 media gateway, where it was converted from TDM to IP and transported across AT&amp;T's WorldNet IP backbone. When it reached the destination, it was passed to the egress LEC's CLASS 5 switch as an untariffed data call.\nCommWorks modified the gateway and softswitch software to support SIP for MCI/WorldCom's hosted business offering in 2000.\nAlthough 3Com sold CommWorks to UTStarcom, they retained intellectual property rights to the softswitch technology. After modifying the software to enable enterprise PBX features, 3Com released this technology as VCX, the industry's first pure SIP PBX, in 2003.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was founded in 1991 by Electronic Arts founder Trip Hawkins in a partnership with seven other companies to develop the 3DO standard of video gaming hardware. When 3DO failed in the marketplace, the company exited the hardware business and became a third-party video game developer and published well-known games series like \"Army Men\", \"Battletanx\", \"High Heat Major League Baseball\" and \"Might and Magic\". It went bankrupt in 2003 due to poor sales of its games.\nHistory.\nHardware developer.\nTrip Hawkins wanted to get into the hardware market after the software market exploded with interest thanks to his involvement at Electronic Arts. When the company was first founded, its original objective was to create a next-generation CD-based video game system specified as the 3DO, which would be manufactured by various partners and licensees; 3DO would collect a royalty on each console sold and on each game manufactured. For game publishers, 3DO's $3 royalty per sold game was very low compared to the royalties Nintendo and Sega collected from game sales on their consoles. The 3DO Company and its initiative received the backing of several industry figures including AT&amp;T, Electronic Arts, Goldstar, Matsushita (owner of Panasonic), MCA, and Time Warner.\nThe launch of the first 3DO system in October 1993 was well-promoted, with a great deal of attention in the mass media as part of the \"multimedia wave\" in the computer world, the first player being a Panasonic model at the price of US$699 (). Poor console and game sales trumped the enticingly low royalty rate and proved a fatal flaw. While 3DO's business model attracted game publishers with its low royalty rates, it resulted in the console selling for a price higher than the SNES and Sega Genesis combined, hampering sales. While companies that manufactured and sold their own consoles could sell them, at a loss, for a competitive price, making up for lost profit through royalties collected from game publishers, the 3DO's manufacturers, not collecting any money from game publishers, and owing royalties to the 3DO Company, had to sell the console for a profit, resulting in high prices. As the console failed to compete with its cheaper competitors, game developers and publishers, while initially attracted by low royalties, dropped support for the console as its games failed to sell. Stock in the 3DO Company dropped from over $37 per share in November 1993 to $23 per share in late December. Though the company's financial figures dramatically improved in the fiscal year ending March 1995, with revenues nearly triple that of the previous fiscal year, they were still operating at a loss. The console's prospects continued to improve through the first half of 1995 with a number of critical success, including winning the 1995 European Computer Trade Show award for best hardware.\nIn January 1996, The 3DO Company sold exclusive rights to its next generation console, M2, to Matsushita for $100 million. Thanks in part to revenues from the sale of M2 technology to Matsushita and other licensees, in the first quarter of 1996 the 3DO Company turned a profit for the first time since it was founded, with a net income of $1.2 million. Over the second half of 1996, the company restructured to focus on software development and online gaming, in the process cutting its staff from 450 to 300 employees. President Hugh Martin was given full operating control, while Hawkins remained with the company as chairman, CEO, and creative director.\nThird-party developer.\nAfter selling the M2 technology to Matsushita, the company acquired Cyclone Studios, New World Computing, and Archetype Interactive. 3DO established a new office in Redmond, Washington devoted to PC games development, with Tony Garcia as its head. In mid-1997 it sold off its hardware business to Samsung for $20 million, making a final break from its origins as a console developer.\nThe company's biggest hit was its series of \"Army Men\" games, featuring generic green plastic soldier toys. Its \"Might and Magic\" and especially \"Heroes of Might and Magic\" series from subsidiary New World Computing were perhaps the most popular among their games at the time of release. During the late 1990s, the company published one of the first 3D MMORPGs: \"Meridian 59\", which survives to this day in the hands of some of the game's original developers.\nBankruptcy and legacy.\n3DO struggled in the early 2000s. According to the SEC, the company reported a net loss of over $10m in the nine months to December 2002. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on May 28, 2003. Employees were laid off without pay. Three companies explored buying the company outright, but an ongoing SEC investigation into the accounting practices of the industry made this less attractive. Instead, the company's assets were put up for sale in an auction. Many of the assets such as game brands and other intellectual property were sold to rivals like Microsoft (\"High Heat Baseball\"), Namco (\"Street Racing Syndicate\"), Take-Two Interactive (\"Army Men\") and Ubisoft (\"Might and Magic\", \"Heroes of Might and Magic\"). Founder Trip Hawkins paid $405,000 for rights to some old brands and the company's \"Internet patent portfolio\". The \"Army Men\" brand sold for $750,000, then a high amount in games acquisition terms. \nI no longer own any 3DO IP, don't keep track of it and don't personally know any owners. Finding it would be like discovering the Ark of the Covenant! Nearly 30 years ago Matsushita and Samsung bought the system and hardware IP and the people involved then have retired. 3DO game software IP was auctioned off in 2003. Microsoft bought High Heat Baseball, Ubisoft bought Might and Magic. I believe Army Men is now owned by Take Two. Mystery solved? \u2014\u200aTrip Hawkins, \"Founder EA &amp; 3DO\"\nThe company ceased to file required financial papers after December 2002. While the company had been void for years, the 2003 Chapter 11 petition remained pending until at least 2008. That year the SEC issued trading restrictions for the group. The company was found to be in default that December and its registered securities were revoked.\nThe \"Army Men\" and the \"Might and Magic\" franchise continued activity for decades after 3DO's closure at other companies. In April 2020, the rights to over 30 classic 3DO titles were purchased from Prism Entertainment by Ziggurat Interactive, a company which specialises in re-releases of older games. The company cited a desire to bring more classics to digital storefronts, and broader efforts towards game preservation. Their work has included the remastered \"Killing Time\", which was released in 2024.\nList of games.\nPublished.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n3DO Rating System.\nThe \"3DO Rating System\" was a rating system created by The 3DO Company and used on games released for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer. The rating system, which went into use in March 1994, uses the following four categories:\nThese ratings would appear on the lower front and back of the packaging, while the back of the packaging also specified what content was present in the game. In late 1994, the majority of 3DO's competitors signed on with a new rating system from the Entertainment Software Rating Board; despite this, the 3DO Company opted to continue providing their own rating system, leaving publishers of 3DO games to decide whether to use the 3DO Rating System or the new ESRB ratings. The 3DO rating for each game was designated voluntarily by the game's publisher, in contrast to the ESRB ratings, which were determined independently by the ESRB.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The 3Station/2E had a 10 MHz 80286 processor, 1 megabyte of RAM (expandable to 5 MB), VGA-compatible graphics with 256 kB of video RAM, and integrated AUI/10BASE2 (BNC) network transceivers for LAN access. The product used a single printed-circuit board with four custom ASICs. It had neither a floppy disk drive nor a hard disk nor any cooling fan device, and thus it was 100% silent during operation, booting from a special \"Startvolume\" - (SW-Image) located at the preferred 3server-XXX Server, while also loading / storing all (HW/SW) Drivers, end-user Apps &amp; Data files on a preferred 3Com Network Server.\nBecause of its very straightforward, simple and optimized internal HW and SW architecture, the 3Station/2E Nnetworking PC appeared to operate extremely fast and efficient during the daily workload for the actual Network Client.\nThe 3Station/2E HW (Systemboard etc.) was further embedded within a quite tasteful / stylish / slimline (1HU) mechanical Case Design far ahead from most PC Cabinet designstyles offered at the market by that time.\n3Com advertised \"significant cost savings\" due to the 3Station's ease of installation and low maintenance (this would now be referred to under the banner of total cost of ownership). The 3Station's cost lay somewhere between that of an IBM PC clone and an IBM PC of the day. It was not commercially successful, nor were any of the similarly configured \"low end\" workstations that followed.\nTypical customer for 3Stations.\n3Stations's were sold as a package with a 3Server as a central hub. The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) were a significant customer for this setup (through Groupe Bull subsidiary Bull HN, n\u00e9e Honeywell), eventually purchasing many thousand 3Stations and associated 3Server machines. The network enabled the tax office to centrally control software versions from the Canberra office, distributing them Australia wide without the tedium and cost of updating thousands of independent, hard drive based PCs.\nWhen the 286 processor became obsolete, the ATO opened a tender for replacement of the 3Station 2E with a suitable 386 based machine. The tender process was eventually won by Bull HN with a product labelled \"3Station/386\", but only shared the external case as a common part. 3Com had very little input into the design other than supplying technical help and access to networking chip sets. The internals were a custom designed single board based on the 3Com Etherlink II for networking, and ATI graphics. 3Station 2 and 3s were manufactured under license in Sydney until the contract ended.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The server may not have the resource or it may not wish to disclose whether it has the resource. The code is often associated with response reason \"Not Found\" and is often referred to as \"page not found\" or \"file not found\".\nOften, the server generates a web page for the condition and the client displays it, and often the content indicates the error code. Since the condition is relatively commonly-encountered (i.e. due to broken or dead links), this code one of the most recognizable on the World Wide Web.\nOverview.\nWhen communicating via HTTP, a server is required to respond to a request, such as a web browser request for a web page, with a numeric response code and an optional, mandatory, or disallowed (based upon the status code) message. In code 404, the first digit indicates a client error, such as a mistyped Uniform Resource Locator (URL). The following two digits indicate the specific error encountered. HTTP's use of three-digit codes is similar to the use of such codes in earlier protocols such as FTP and NNTP. At the HTTP level, a 404 response code is followed by a human-readable \"reason phrase\". The HTTP specification suggests the phrase \"Not Found\" and many web servers by default issue an HTML page that includes both the 404 code and the \"Not Found\" phrase.\nA 404 error is often returned when pages have been moved or deleted. In the first case, it is better to employ URL mapping or URL redirection by returning a 301 Moved Permanently response, which can be configured in most server configuration files, or through URL rewriting; in the second case, a 410 Gone should be returned. Because these two options require special server configuration, most websites do not make use of them.\n404 errors should not be confused with DNS errors, which appear when the given URL refers to a server name that does not exist. A 404 error indicates that the server itself was found, but that the server was not able to retrieve the requested page.\nSoft 404 errors.\nSome websites report a \"not found\" error by returning a standard web page with a \"200 OK\" response code, falsely reporting that the page loaded properly; this is known as a \"soft 404\". The term \"soft 404\" was introduced in 2004 by Ziv Bar-Yossef \"et al\".\nSoft 404s are problematic for automated methods of discovering whether a link is broken. Some search engines, like Yahoo and Google, use automated processes to detect soft 404s. Soft 404s can occur as a result of configuration errors when using certain HTTP server software, for example with the Apache software, when an Error Document 404 (specified in a .htaccess file) is specified as an absolute path (e.g. http://example.com/error.html) rather than a relative path (/error.html). This can also be done on purpose to force some browsers (like Internet Explorer) to display a customized 404 error message rather than replacing what is served with a browser-specific \"friendly\" error message (in Internet Explorer, this behavior is triggered when a 404 is served and the received HTML is shorter than a certain length, and can be manually disabled by the user).\nThere are also \"soft 3XX\" errors where content is returned with a status 200 but comes from a redirected page, such as when missing pages are redirected to the domain root/home page.\nProxy servers.\nSome proxy servers generate a 404 error when a 500-range error code would be more correct. If the proxy server is unable to satisfy a request for a page because of a problem with the remote host (such as hostname resolution failures or refused TCP connections), this should be described as a 5xx Internal Server Error, but might deliver a 404 instead. This can confuse programs that expect and act on specific responses, as they can no longer easily distinguish between an absent web server and a missing web page on a web server that is present.\nIntentional 404s.\nIn July 2004, the UK telecom provider BT Group deployed the Cleanfeed content blocking system, which returns a 404 error to any request for content identified as potentially illegal by the Internet Watch Foundation. Other ISPs return a HTTP 403 \"forbidden\" error in the same circumstances. The practice of employing fake 404 errors as a means to conceal censorship has also been reported in Thailand and Tunisia. In Tunisia, where censorship was severe before the 2011 revolution, people became aware of the nature of the fake 404 errors and created an imaginary character named \"Ammar 404\" who represents \"the invisible censor\".\nMicrosoft Internet Server 404 substatus error codes.\nThe webserver software developed by Microsoft, Microsoft's Internet Information Services (IIS), returns a set of substatus codes with its 404 responses. The substatus codes take the form of decimal numbers appended to the 404 status code. The substatus codes are not officially recognized by IANA and are not returned by non-Microsoft servers.\nSubstatus codes.\nMicrosoft's IIS 7.0, IIS 7.5, and IIS 8.0 servers define the following HTTP substatus codes to indicate a more specific cause of a 404 error:\nCustom error pages.\nWeb servers can typically be configured to display a customised 404 error page, including a more natural description, the parent site's branding, and sometimes a site map, a search form or 404-page widget. The protocol level phrase, which is hidden from the user, is rarely customized. Internet Explorer, however, will not display custom pages unless they are larger than 512 bytes, opting instead to display a \"friendly\" error page. Google Chrome included similar functionality, where the 404 is replaced with alternative suggestions generated by Google algorithms, if the page is under 512 bytes in size. Another problem is that if the page does not provide a favicon, and a separate custom 404-page exists, extra traffic and longer loading times will be generated on every page view.\nMany organizations use 404 error pages as an opportunity to inject humor into what may otherwise be a serious website. For example, Metro UK shows a polar bear on a skateboard, and the web development agency Left Logic has a simple drawing program. During the 2015 UK general election campaign the main political parties all used their 404 pages to either take aim at political opponents or show relevant policies to potential supporters. In Europe, the NotFound project, created by multiple European organizations including Missing Children Europe and Child Focus, encourages site operators to add a snippet of code to serve customized 404 error pages which provide data about missing children.\nWhile many websites send additional information in a 404 error message\u2014such as a link to the homepage of a website or a search box\u2014some also endeavor to find the correct web page the user wanted. Extensions are available for some content management systems (CMSs) to do this.\nTracking 404 errors.\nA number of tools exist that crawl through a website to find pages that return 404 status codes. These tools can be helpful in finding links that exist within a particular website. The limitation of these tools is that they only find links within one particular website, and ignore 404s resulting from links on other websites. As a result, these tools miss out on 83% of the 404s on websites. One way around this is to find 404 errors by analyzing external links.\nOne of the most effective ways to discover 404 errors is by using Google Search Console, Google Analytics or crawling software.\nAnother common method is tracking traffic to 404 pages using log file analysis. This can be useful to understand more about what 404s users reached on the site. Another method of tracking traffic to 404 pages is using JavaScript-based traffic tracking tools.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Since the wide deployment of faster, cheaper technologies, 56\u00a0kbit/s lines are generally considered to be an obsolete technology.\nSpeed derivation.\nThe figure of 56\u00a0kbit/s is derived from its implementation using the same digital infrastructure used since the 1960s for digital telephony in the public switched telephone network, which uses a sampling rate of 8,000\u00a0Hz for PCM audio with 8-bit audio bit depth to encode analogue signals into a digital stream of 64,000\u00a0bit/s. However, in the T-carrier systems used in the US and Canada, a technique called bit-robbing uses, in every sixth frame, the least significant bit for Channel Associated Signaling (CAS). This effectively renders the lowest bit of the 8 speech bits unusable for data transmission, and so a 56\u00a0kbit/s line uses only 7 of the 8 data bits in each sample period to send data, thus giving a data rate of 8 kHz \u00d7 7 bits \n 56 kbit/s.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "35511", "revid": "25046916", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35511", "title": "5ESS Switching System", "text": "Telephone electronic switching system\nThe 5ESS Switching System is a Class 5 telephone electronic switching system developed by Western Electric for the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T) and the Bell System in the United States. It came into service in 1982 and the last unit was produced in 2003.\nHistory.\nThe 5ESS came to market as the Western Electric No. 5 ESS. It commenced service in Seneca, Illinois on March 25, 1982, and was destined to replace the Number One Electronic Switching System (1ESS and 1AESS) and other electromechanical systems in the 1980s and 1990s. The 5ESS was also used as a Class-4 telephone switch or as a hybrid Class 4/Class 5 switch in markets too small for the 4ESS. Approximately half of all US central offices are served by 5ESS switches. The 5ESS was also exported, and manufactured outside the US under license.\nThe 5ESS\u20132000 version, introduced in the 1990s, increased the capacity of the switching module (SM), with more peripheral modules and more optical links per SM to the communications module (CM). A follow-on version, the 5ESS\u2013R/E, was in development during the late 1990s but did not reach market. Another version was the 5E\u2013XC.\nThe 5ESS technology was transferred to the AT&amp;T Network Systems division upon the 1984 breakup of the Bell System. The division was divested by AT&amp;T in 1996 as Lucent Technologies, and after becoming Alcatel-Lucent in 2006, it was acquired by Nokia in 2016.\nThe 5ESS switch is still in widespread use in the public switched telephone network (PSTN) in the United States and elsewhere, but they are being replaced with more modern packet switching systems. 5ESS switches in service in 2021 also included several operated by the United States Navy.\nArchitecture.\nThe 5ESS switch has three main types of modules: the Administrative Module (AM) contains the central computers; the Communications Module (CM) is the central time-divided switch of the system; and the Switching Module (SM) makes up the majority of the equipment in most exchanges. The SM performs multiplexing, analog and digital coding, and other work to interface with external equipment. Each has a controller, a small computer with duplicated CPUs and memories, like most common equipment of the exchange, for redundancy. Distributed systems lessen the load on the Central Administrative Module (AM) or main computer.\nPower for all circuitry is distributed as \u201348 VDC (nominal), and converted locally to logic levels or telephone signals.\nSwitching Module.\nEach Switching Module (SM) handles several hundred to a few thousand telephone lines or several hundred trunks or combination thereof. Each has its own processors, also called Module Controllers, which perform most call handling processes, using their own memory boards. Originally the peripheral processors were to be Intel 8086, but those proved inadequate and the system was introduced with Motorola 68000 series processors. The name of the cabinet that houses this equipment was changed at the same time from Interface Module to Switching Module.\nPeripheral units are on shelves in the SM. In most exchanges the majority are Line Units (LU) and Digital Line Trunk Units (DLTU). Each SM has Local Digital Service Units (LDSU) to provide various services to lines and trunks in the SM, including tone generation and detection. Global Digital Service Units (GDSU) provide less-frequently used services to the entire exchange. The Time Slot Interchanger (TSI) in the SM uses random-access memory to delay each speech sample to fit into a time slot which will carry its call through the exchange to another or, in some cases, the same SM.\nT-carrier spans are terminated, originally one per card but in later models usually two, in Digital Line Trunk Units (DLTU) which concentrate their DS0 channels into the TSI. These may serve either interoffice trunks or, using Integrated Subscriber Loop Carrier, subscriber lines. Higher-capacity DS3 signals can also have their DS0 signals switched in Digital Network Unit SONET (DNUS) units, without demultiplexing them into DS1. Newer SM's have DNUS (DS3) and Optical OIU interfaces (OC12) with a large amount of capacity.\nSMs have Dual Link Interface (DLI) cards to connect them by multi-mode optical fibers to the Communications Modules for time-divided switching to other SMs. These links may be short, for example within the same building, or may connect to SMs in remote locations. Calls among the lines and trunks of a particular SM needn't go through CM, and an SM located remotely can act as distributed switching, administered from the central AM. Each SM has two Module Controller/Time Slot Interchange (MCTSI) circuits for redundancy.\nIn contrast to Nortel's DMS-100 which uses individual line cards with a codec, most lines are on two-stage analog space-division concentrators or \"Line Units\", which connect as many as 512 lines, as needed, to the 8 \"Channel card\"s that each contain 8 codecs, and to high-level service circuits for ringing and testing. Both stages of concentration are included on the same GDX (Gated Diode Access) board. Each GDX board serves 32 lines, 16 A links and 32 B links. Limited availability saves money with incompletely filled matrixes. The Line Unit can have up to 16 GDX boards connecting to the channel boards by shared B links, but in offices with heavier traffic for lines a lesser number of GDX boards are equipped.\nISDN lines are served by individual line cards in an ISLU (Integrated Services Line Unit).\nAdministrative Module.\nThe Administrative Module (AM) is a dual-processor mini main frame computer of the AT&amp;T 3B series, running UNIX-RTR. AM contains the hard drives and tape drives used to load and backup the central and peripheral processor software and translations. Disk drives were originally several 300 megabyte SMD multi-platter units in a separate frame. Now they consist of several redundant multi-gigabyte SCSI drives that each reside on a card. Tape drives were originally half inch open reel at 6250 bits per inch, which were replaced in the early 1990s with 4\u00a0mm Digital Audio Tape cassettes.\nThe Administrative Module is built on the 3B21D platform and is used to load software to the many microprocessors throughout the switch and to provide high speed control functions. It provides messaging and interface to control terminals. The AM of a 5ESS consists of the 3B20x or 3B21D processor unit, including I/O, disks, and tape drive units. Once the 3B21D has loaded the software into the 5ESS and the switch is activated, packet switching takes place without further action by the 3B21D, except for billing functions requiring records to be transferred to disk for storage. Because the processor has duplex hardware, one active side, and one standby side, a failure of one side of the processor will not necessarily result in a loss of switching.\nCommunication Module.\nThe Communications Module (CM) forms the central time switch of the exchange. 5ESS uses a time-space-time (TST) topology in which the Time-Slot-Interchangers (TSI) in the Switching Modules assign each phone call to a time slot for routing through the CM.\nCMs perform time-divided switching and are provided in pairs; each module (cabinet) belonging to Office Network and Timing Complex (ONTC) 0 or 1, roughly corresponding to the switch planes of other designs. Each SM has four optical fiber links, two connecting to a CM belonging to ONTC 0 and two to ONTC 1. Each optical link consists of two multimode optical fibers with ST connectors to plug into transceivers plugged into backplane wiring at each end. CMs receive time-multiplexed signals on the receive fiber and send them to the appropriate destination SM on the send fiber.\nVery Compact Digital Exchange.\nThe Very Compact Digital Exchange (VCDX) was developed with the 5ESS-2000, and marketed to mostly non-Bell telephone companies as an inexpensive, effective way to offer ISDN and other digital services in an analog switching center. This avoided the capital expense of retrofitting the entire analog switch into a digital one to serve all of the switch's lines when many wouldn't require it and would remain POTS lines.\nAn example would be the (former) GTE/Verizon Class-5 telephone switch, the GTD-5 EAX. Like the Western Electric 1ESS/1AESS, it served mostly medium to large wire centers.\nThe standalone VCDX was also capable of serving as a switch for very small wire centers (a CDX- Community dial office) of fewer than ~400 lines. However, for small wire centers, 400-4000 lines, that function was usually served by RSM's, a 5ESS \"Remote SM\", ORM's or Wired ORM's.\nThe RSM is controlled by T1 lines connected to a DLTU unit. The first 2 T1's are the control of the RSM and are necessary for any Recent Changes to take place. RSM's can have up to 10 T1's. There can be multiple RSM's in an office. An ORM can be fed via direct fiber or via coax thus called Wired ORM's. An RSM or ORM can have many of the same peripheral units that are part of a full 5ESS switch. An RSM has a limited distance and can serve parts of a larger metro area or rural offices. An ORM or wired ORM can be anywhere technically, and preferred over the RSM once the ORM became available. Both the RSM and ORM is often used as a Class-5 wire center for small to medium towns hosted from a 5ESS located in a larger city. The Wired ORM is connected via coax from a MUX unit and fed to a TRCU which converts the coax to connection to the DLI, There was also a two-mile ORM that was used when an office was broken out or took an area from another office. The distance on this was 2 miles from a host office and fed direct via fiber. As with any SM, the size is dictated by the number of time slots needed for each peripheral unit. ORM's are linked with DS3, RSM's are linked with T1 lines.\nThe VCDX was also used as a large private branch exchange (PBX).\nSmall communities of less than 400 lines or so were also provided with SLC-96 units or Anymedia units.\nThe standalone VCDX has a single Switching Module, and no Communications Module. Its Sun Microsystems SPARC workstation runs the UNIX-based Solaris (operating system) that executes a 3B20/21D processor MERT OS emulation system, acting as the VCDX's Administrative Module. The VCDX uses the CO's normal telephone power sources (which are very large uninterruptible power supplies), and has connections to the CO Digital cross connect system for T1 access, etc.\nSignaling.\nThe 5ESS has two different signaling architectures: Common Network Interface (CNI) Ring and Packet Switching Unit (PSU)-based SS7 Signaling.\nSoftware.\nThe development effort for 5ESS required five thousand employees, producing 100 million lines of system source code, mostly in the C language, with 100 million lines of header files and makefiles. Evolution of the system took place over 20 years, while three releases were often being developed simultaneously, each taking about three years to complete. The 5ESS was originally U.S.-only and the international sales resulted in a complete development system and team, in parallel to the U.S. version.\nThe development systems were Unix-based mainframe systems. There were around 15 of these systems active at the peak. There were development machines, simulator machines, and build machines, etc. Developers' desktops were multi-window terminals (versions of the Blit developed by Bell Labs) until the mid 1990s, when Sun workstations were deployed. Developers continued to login into the servers for their work, using X11 on their workstations as a multi-window environment.\nSource code management was based on SCCS and utilized \"#feature\" lines to separate source code between releases, between features specific to US or Intl, and the like. Customisation around the vi and Emacs text editors allowed developers to work with the appropriate view of a file, hiding the parts that were not applicable to their current project.\nThe change request system used the SCCS MR to create named change sets, tied into the IMR (initial modification request) system which had purely numeric identifiers. An MR name was created with subsystem prefix, IMR number, MR sequence characters, and a character for the release or \"load\". So, for the gr (generic retrofit) subsystem, the first MR created for the 2371242 IMR, destined for the 'F' load, would be gr2371242aF.\nThe build system used a simple mechanism of build configuration that would cause makefile generation to occur. The system always built everything, but used checksum results to decide if a file had actually changed, before updating the build output directory tree. This provided a huge reduction in build time when a core library or header was being edited. A developer could add values to an enum, but if that did not change the build output, then subsequent dependencies on that output would not have to be relinked or libraries built.\nOAMP.\nThe system is administered through an assortment of teletypewriter \"channels\", also called the system console, such as the TEST channel and the Maintenance channel. Typically provisioning is done either through a command line interface (CLI) called RCV:APPTEXT, or through the menu-driven RCV:MENU,APPRC program. RCV stands for Recent Change/Verification, and can be accessed through the Switching Control Center System. Most service orders, however, are administered through the Recent Change Memory Administration Center (RCMAC). In the international market, this terminal interface has localization to provide locale-specific language and command name variations on the screen and printer output.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "35519", "revid": "1319958226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35519", "title": "1997 United Kingdom general election", "text": "The 1997 United Kingdom general election was held on Thursday, 1 May 1997. The governing Conservative Party led by Prime Minister John Major was defeated in a landslide by the opposition Labour Party led by Tony Blair, which achieved a 179-seat majority and a total of 418 seats.\nThis was the first victory for the Labour party in a general election in nearly 23 years, its previous one registering a majority of 3 seats in October 1974 under the leadership of Harold Wilson. It was also Labour's first comprehensive victory over the Conservatives since the 1966 election, which had produced a near 100-seat majority. This election also marked Labour's highest vote share since the 1970 election and its second highest total number of votes in history (the largest being the 1951 election). On the other hand, it was an ignominious end to the 18-year government of the Conservatives, the longest continuous period of government of any party in modern British history. This election marked the third-largest defeat ever suffered by the Conservatives (the largest being the 2024 election) with the party left with just 165 seats\u2014it was left devoid of any MPs outside England, with only 17 MPs north of the Midlands, and with less than 20% of MPs in London. Additionally, the party also registered its lowest share of the vote since 1832 as well as its lowest vote in absolute terms since 1929. This would be the last election until 2024 that the Conservatives decreased their share of the vote.\nThe political backdrop of campaigning focused on public opinion towards a change in government. Blair, as Labour Leader, focused on transforming his party through a more centrist policy platform, titled \"New Labour\", with promises of devolution referendums for Scotland and Wales, fiscal responsibility, and a decision to nominate more female politicians for election through the use of all-women shortlists from which to choose candidates. Major sought to rebuild public trust in the Conservatives following a series of scandals, including the events of Black Wednesday in 1992, through campaigning on the strength of the economic recovery following the early 1990s recession, but faced divisions within the party over the UK's membership of the European Union.\nOpinion polls during campaigning showed strong support for Labour due to Blair's personal popularity, and Blair won a personal public endorsement from \"The Sun\" newspaper two months before the vote. The final result of the election on 2 May 1997 revealed that Labour had won a landslide majority, making a net gain of 146 seats and winning 43.2% of the vote. 150 Members of Parliament, including 133 Conservatives, lost their seats. The Conservatives, meanwhile, suffered defeat with a net loss of 178 seats, winning 30.7% of the vote. The Liberal Democrats led by Paddy Ashdown made a net gain of 28 seats, winning 16.8% of the vote. Labour's victory, the largest achieved in its history and by any political party in British politics since the Second World War, brought about the party's first of three consecutive terms in power (lasting a total of 13 years), with Blair as the newly appointed prime minister. The Liberal Democrats' success in the election, in part due to anti-Conservative tactical voting, strengthened both Ashdown's leadership and the party's position as a strong third party, having won the highest number of seats by any third party since 1929.\nAlthough the Conservatives lost many ministers such as Michael Portillo, Tony Newton, Malcolm Rifkind, Ian Lang and William Waldegrave and controversial MPs such as Neil Hamilton and Jonathan Aitken, some of the Conservative newcomers in this election were future Prime Minister Theresa May, future Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond, future Leader of the House Andrew Lansley, and future Speaker John Bercow. Meanwhile, Labour newcomers included future Cabinet and Shadow Cabinet members Hazel Blears, Ben Bradshaw, Yvette Cooper, Caroline Flint, Barry Gardiner, Alan Johnson, Ruth Kelly, John McDonnell, Stephen Twigg and Rosie Winterton, as well as future Scottish Labour Leader Jim Murphy and future Speaker Lindsay Hoyle. The election of 120 women, including 101 to the Labour benches, came to be seen as a watershed moment in female political representation in the UK.\nBackground.\nThe British economy had been in recession at the time of the 1992 general election, which the governing Conservative Party led by John Major had won. The recession ended within a year, but later events such as Black Wednesday severely tarnished the Conservative government's reputation for economic management. Meanwhile, the opposition Labour Party elected John Smith as its leader in 1992 to succeed Neil Kinnock; however, Smith's death from a heart attack in 1994 led to a leadership election which was won by Shadow Home Secretary Tony Blair.\nBlair sought to bring the party closer to the political centre of the era, including rebranding the party as \"New Labour\". He convinced the party's members and affiliated trades unions to support the removal of Clause IV from its constitution, which had committed it to the mass nationalisation of industry, and the party also reversed its policy on unilateral nuclear disarmament. The events of Black Wednesday also meant Labour\u2014and shadow chancellor Gordon Brown\u2014were perceived as offering more competent economic management than the Conservatives.\nLabour's manifesto, \"New Labour, New Life for Britain\", was published in 1996 and outlined five key pledges:\nDisputes within the Conservative government over European Union issues, and a variety of \"sleaze\" allegations, severely affected the government's popularity. Despite the economic recovery and fall in unemployment in the four years leading up to the election, the rise in Conservative support was only marginal, with all of the major opinion polls showing Labour in a comfortable lead from late 1992 onwards.\nFollowing the 1992 general election, the Conservatives remained in government with 336 of the 651 House of Commons seats, but through a series of defections and by-election defeats the government gradually lost its absolute majority. By 1997, the Conservatives held only 324 seats and had not won a by-election since Richmond in 1989.\nTiming.\nThe previous Parliament first sat on 27 April 1992. The Parliament Act 1911 required at the time for each Parliament to be dissolved on the fifth anniversary of its first sitting; therefore, the latest date the dissolution and the summoning of the next parliament could have been held on was 27 April 1997.\nThe 1985 amendment of the Representation of the People Act 1983 required that the election must take place on the eleventh working day after the deadline for nomination papers, which in turn must be no more than six working days after the next parliament was summoned.\nTherefore, the latest date the election could have been held on was 22 May 1997 (which happened to be a Thursday). British elections (and referendums) have been held on Thursdays by convention since the 1930s, but can be held on other working days.\nCampaign.\nMajor called the election on Monday 17 March 1997, ensuring the formal campaign would be unusually long, at six weeks (Parliament was dissolved on 8 April). The election was scheduled for 1 May, to coincide with the local elections on the same day. This set a precedent, as the three subsequent general elections were also held alongside the May local elections.\nThe Conservatives argued that a long campaign would expose Labour and allow the Conservative message to be heard. However, Major was accused of arranging an early dissolution to protect Neil Hamilton from a pending parliamentary report into his conduct: a report that Major had earlier guaranteed would be published before the election.\nIn March 1997, soon after the election was called, Asda introduced a range of election-themed beers, these being \"Major's Mild\", \"Tony's Tipple\" and \"Ashdown's Ale\".\nThe political backdrop of campaigning focused on public opinion towards a change in government. Blair, as Labour leader, focused on transforming his party through a more centrist policy platform, titled \"New Labour\", with promises of devolution referendums for Scotland and Wales, fiscal responsibility, and a decision to nominate more female politicians for election through the use of all-women shortlists from which to choose candidates. Major sought to rebuild public trust in the Conservatives following a series of scandals, including the events of Black Wednesday in 1992, through campaigning on the strength of the economic recovery following the early 1990s recession, but faced divisions within the party over the UK's membership of the European Union.\nOpinion polls during campaigning showed strong support for Labour due to Blair's personal popularity, and Blair won a personal public endorsement from \"The Sun\" newspaper two months before the vote.\nConservative campaign.\nMajor hoped that a long campaign would expose Labour's \"hollowness\" and the Conservative campaign emphasised stability, as did its manifesto title 'You can only be sure with the Conservatives'. However, the campaign was beset by deep-set problems, such as the rise of James Goldsmith's Referendum Party which advocated a referendum on continued membership of the European Union. The party threatened to take away many right-leaning voters from the Conservatives. Furthermore, about 200 candidates broke with official Conservative policy to oppose British membership of the single European currency. Major fought back, saying: \"Whether you agree with me or disagree with me; like me or loathe me, don't bind my hands when I am negotiating on behalf of the British nation.\" The moment is remembered as one of the defining, and most surreal, moments of the election.\nMeanwhile, there was also division amongst the Conservative cabinet, with Chancellor Kenneth Clarke describing the views of Home Secretary Michael Howard on Europe as \"paranoid and xenophobic nonsense\". The Conservatives also struggled to come up with a definitive theme to attack Labour, with some strategists arguing for an approach which castigated Labour for \"stealing Tory clothes\" (copying their positions), with others making the case for a more confrontational approach, stating that \"New Labour\" was just a fa\u00e7ade for \"old Labour\".\nThe New Labour, New Danger poster, which depicted Tony Blair with demon eyes, was an example of the latter strategy. Major veered between the two approaches, which left Conservative Central Office staff frustrated. As Andrew Cooper explained: \"We repeatedly tried and failed to get him to understand that you couldn't say that they were dangerous and copying you at the same time.\" In any case, the campaign failed to gain much traction, and the Conservatives went down to a landslide defeat at the polls.\nLabour campaign.\nLabour ran a slick campaign that emphasised the splits within the Conservative government and argued that the country needed a more centrist administration. It thus successfully picked up dissatisfied Conservative voters, particularly moderate and suburban ones. Tony Blair, who was personally highly popular, was very much the centrepiece of the campaign and proved a highly effective campaigner.\nThe Labour campaign was reminiscent of those of Bill Clinton for the US presidency in 1992 and 1996, focusing on centrist themes as well as adopting policies more commonly associated with the right, such as cracking down on crime and fiscal responsibility. The influence of political \"spin\" came into great effect for Labour at this point, as media centric figures such as Alastair Campbell and Peter Mandelson provided a clear cut campaign, and establishing a relatively new political brand New Labour with enviable success. In this election Labour adopted the theme in their campaign and advertising.\nLiberal Democrat campaign.\nThe Liberal Democrats had suffered a disappointing performance in 1992, but they were very much strengthened in 1997 due in part to potential tactical voting between Labour and Lib Dem supporters in Conservative marginal constituencies, particularly in the south of England \u2013 which explains why while given their share of the vote decreased, their number of seats nearly doubled. The Lib Dems promised to increase education funding paid for by a 1p increase in income tax.\nNotional 1992 results.\nThe election was fought under new boundaries, with a net increase of eight seats compared to the 1992 election (651 to 659). Changes listed here are from the notional 1992 result, had it been fought on the boundaries established in 1997. These notional results were calculated by Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher and were used by all media organisations at the time.\nResults.\nLabour won a landslide victory with its largest parliamentary majority (179) to date. On the BBC's election night programme Professor Anthony King described the result of the exit poll, which accurately predicted a Labour landslide, as being akin to \"an asteroid hitting the planet and destroying practically all life on Earth\". After years of trying, Labour had convinced the electorate that they would usher in a new age of prosperity\u2014their policies, organisation and tone of optimism slotting perfectly into place.\nLabour's victory was largely credited to the charisma of Tony Blair, as well as a Labour public relations machine managed by Alastair Campbell and Peter Mandelson. Between the 1992 election and the 1997 election there had also been major steps to \"modernise\" the party, including scrapping Clause IV that had committed the party to extending public ownership of industry. Labour had suddenly seized the middle ground of the political spectrum, attracting voters much further to the right than their traditional working class or left wing support. In the early hours of 2 May 1997 a party was held at the Royal Festival Hall, in which Blair stated that \"a new dawn has broken, has it not?\"\nThe election was a crushing defeat for the Conservatives, with the party having its lowest percentage share of the popular vote since 1832 under the Duke of Wellington's leadership, being wiped out in Scotland and Wales. A number of prominent Conservative MPs lost their seats in the election, including Michael Portillo, Malcolm Rifkind, Edwina Currie, David Mellor, Neil Hamilton and Norman Lamont. Such was the extent of Conservative losses at the election that Cecil Parkinson, speaking on the BBC's election night programme, joked upon the Conservatives winning their second seat that he was pleased that the subsequent election for the leadership would be contested.\nThe Liberal Democrats stood on a more left-wing manifesto than Labour, and more than doubled their number of seats thanks to the use of tactical voting against the Conservatives. Although their share of the vote fell slightly, their total of 46 MPs was the highest for any UK Liberal party since David Lloyd George led the party to 59 seats in 1929.\nThe Referendum Party, which sought a referendum on the United Kingdom's relationship with the European Union, came fourth in terms of votes with 800,000 votes and won no seats in parliament.\nThe six parties with the next highest votes stood only in either Scotland, Northern Ireland or Wales; in order, they were the Scottish National Party, the Ulster Unionist Party, the Social Democratic and Labour Party, Plaid Cymru, Sinn F\u00e9in, and the Democratic Unionist Party.\nIn the previously safe seat of Tatton, where incumbent Conservative MP Neil Hamilton was facing charges of having taken cash for questions, the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties decided not to field candidates in order that an independent candidate, Martin Bell, would have a better chance of winning the seat, which he did with a comfortable margin.\nThe result declared for the constituency of Winchester showed a margin of victory of just two votes for the Liberal Democrats. The defeated Conservative candidate mounted a successful legal challenge to the result on the grounds that errors by election officials (failures to stamp certain votes) had changed the result; the court ruled the result invalid and ordered a by-election on 20 November which was won by the Liberal Democrats with a much larger majority, causing much recrimination in the Conservative Party about the decision to challenge the original result in the first place.\nThis election saw a doubling of the number of women in parliament, from 60 elected in 1992 to 120 elected in 1997. 101 of them (controversially described as Blair Babes) were on the Labour benches, a number driven by the Labour Party's 1993 policy (ruled illegally discriminatory in 1996) of all-women shortlists. This election has therefore been widely seen as a watershed moment for representation of women in the UK.\nThis election marked the start of Labour government for the next 13 years, lasting until the formation of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition in 2010.\n\n&lt;section begin=\"UK General Election 1997\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAll parties with more than 500 votes shown. Labour total includes New Labour and \"Labour Time for Change\" candidates; Conservative total includes candidates in Northern Ireland (excluded in some lists) and \"Loyal Conservative\" candidate.\nThe Popular Unionist MP elected in 1992 died in 1995, and the party folded shortly afterwards.\nThere was no incumbent Speaker in the 1992 election.\n&lt;section end=\"UK General Election 1997\"/&gt;\nPost-election events.\nThe poor results for the Conservative Party led to infighting, with the One Nation group, Tory Reform Group, and right-wing Maastricht Rebels blaming each other for the defeat. Party chairman Brian Mawhinney said on the night of the election that defeat was due to disillusionment with 18 years of Conservative rule. John Major resigned as party leader, saying \"When the curtain falls, it is time to get off the stage\".\nFollowing the defeat, the Conservatives began their longest continuous spell in opposition in the history of the present day (post\u2013Tamworth Manifesto) Conservative Party \u2013 and indeed the longest such spell for any incarnation of the Tories/Conservatives since the 1760s and the end of the Whig Supremacy under Kings George I and George II \u2013 lasting 13 years, including the whole of the 2000s. Throughout this period, their representation in the Commons remained consistently below 200 MPs.\nMeanwhile, Paddy Ashdown's continued leadership of the Liberal Democrats was assured, and they were felt to be in a position to build positively as a strong third party into the new millennium, culminating in their sharing power in the 2010 coalition with the Conservatives.\nInternet coverage.\nWith the huge rise in internet use since the previous general election, BBC News created a special website \u2013 BBC Politics 97 \u2013 covering the election. This site was an experiment for the efficiency of an online news service which was due for launch later in the year.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

An estimated 136.6\u00a0million births and 53.2\u00a0million deaths took place in 2004. The average global life expectancy was 67.7 years, an increase of 0.3 years from 2003. The estimated number of global refugees decreased from 9.59\u00a0million to 9.24\u00a0million by the end of the year. Afghanistan was the largest source of refugees, with approximately 2.1\u00a0million people.\nConflicts.\nThere were 32 armed conflicts in 2004 that resulted in at least 25 fatalities, all of which involved violent non-state actors. Seven of these resulted in at least 1,000 fatalities: the Colombian conflict, the Iraqi insurgency, the Kashmir insurgency, the Nepalese Civil War, the Second Chechen War in Russia, the Second Sudanese Civil War, the Sudanese War in Darfur, and the Lord's Resistance Army insurgency in Uganda.\nThe Iraqi insurgency emerged in Iraq in 2004 and carried out attacks against the US-backed caretaker government. It was initially confined to the Sunni Triangle, but it expanded to other areas throughout the year with two suicide bombings in Iraqi Kurdistan on February 1 and a conflict with the Shia Mahdi Army in April. Conflicts with al-Qaeda continued in 2004, primarily in Pakistan along the Afghanistan\u2013Pakistan border. An Islamic militant uprising also took place in northern Nigeria. Although the Second Congo War had ended, insurgencies continued within the Democratic Republic of the Congo in Ituri and in Kivu. Globally, two major rebel groups acted for the first time in 2004: the National Revolutionary Front for the Liberation and Reconstruction of Haiti successfully brought about the resignation of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, while the Islamic Jihad Union was defeated in its attempt to overthrow the government of Uzbekistan.\nThe War in Darfur escalated significantly in Sudan with debate over whether its mass killings constituted a genocide. The Burundian Civil War was complicated as factionalism divided the CNDD-FDD and tentative peace agreements with the government were opposed by the National Forces of Liberation. The Nepalese Civil War escalated as the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) abducted over one thousand people to train as fighters and the Nepalese government established civilian militias. The frozen conflict between Georgia and the breakaway state of South Ossetia escalated in July and August until a ceasefire was signed on August 18. The Second Chechen War continued in 2004 with a bombing that killed Russian-backed Chechen president Akhmad Kadyrov.\nTwo major peace agreements were made in 2004: one between Senegal and the Movement of Democratic Forces of Casamance, and one between Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement. A ceasefire was established in Uganda after the Ugandan military made significant gains over the Lord's Resistance Army. A 2003 ceasefire held in the Kashmir conflict, bringing about the conflict's first full year without military action in roughly a decade, although an insurgency continued in the region. Disarmament of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia began in November during the Colombian conflict, but fighting with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia continued and the Colombian government launched its Plan Patriota mobilization program.\nCulture.\nThe highest-grossing film globally in 2004 was \"Shrek 2\", followed by \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\" and \"Spider-Man 2\". The highest-grossing non-English film was \"The Passion of the Christ\", the fifth highest-grossing film of the year. Critically acclaimed films from 2004 include \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\", \"\", and \"Million Dollar Baby\"\nMusic sales in 2004 amounted to about 2.75 billion physical units, stalling the decline of units in previous years. CD albums made up 86% of sales, but DVD and digital music continued an upward trajectory. The best-selling album globally in 2004 was \"Confessions\" by Usher, followed by \"Feels like Home\" by Norah Jones and \"Encore\" by Eminem. The best-selling non-English album was the Japanese album \"Utada Hikaru Single Collection Vol. 1\" by Hikaru Utada, the 19th best-selling of the year.\nCritically acclaimed video games from 2004 include \"\", \"Half-Life 2\", and \"Halo 2\".\nEconomy.\nThe economy in 2004 grew steadily without significant interruptions. The gross world product increased by 4% in 2004, an increase from the 2.8% growth in 2003, with the highest growth taking place in the developing world. International trade increased by over 10%. The global economy had recovered from the early 2000s recession by 2004, so governments in the developed world tightened monetary policy and central banks raised their interest rates. The United States dollar depreciated as the American trade deficit increased, while surpluses in Japan and the European Union led to appreciation for the Japanese yen and the euro. Growing demand for oil led oil prices to increase by over 50%, which was followed by a smaller decrease in price; the global economy accommodated the price increase without significant inflation or price shock.\nEnvironment and weather.\nThe year 2004 was the fourth hottest year on record, and it was the first in four years to have above-average precipitation. Major heat waves occurred in Australia, Japan, and Spain, while deadly cold waves occurred in Peru and southern Asia. Heavy winter storms occurred in the Middle East and around the Mediterranean. Ongoing droughts continued in the Horn of Africa and the western United States, while deadly floods occurred in Brazil and on the Mexico\u2013United States border. A magnitude 9.1 earthquake struck Indonesia on December 26; the earthquake and the resulting tsunami killed approximately 230,000 people across the region.\nThere were 15 named storms in the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season 2004, nine of which were hurricanes. The most intense storms were Hurricane Ivan, Hurricane Charley, Hurricane Frances, and Hurricane Karl. It was the second deadliest hurricane season of the previous 30 years, as Hurricane Jeanne killed over 3,000 people in Haiti as well as leaving hundreds of thousands of people homeless. There were 31 tropical storms in the 2004 Pacific typhoon season, 21 of which were typhoons. The most intense typhoons were Typhoon Dianmu, Typhoon Chaba, and Typhoon Nida, and Typhoon Ma-on. Seven tropical storms made landfall in Japan, and it suffered the most typhoon strikes since 1982 with four typhoons. Typhoon Rananim, the strongest typhoon to strike eastern China in five decades, destroyed 42,400 homes. Typhoon Muifa and Typhoon Nanmadol killed a combined total of 1,375 people in Philippines.\nEvents.\nDate unknown.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Second Continental Congress took various steps toward organizing an American government, appointing George Washington commander-in-chief (June 14), Benjamin Franklin postmaster general (July 26) and creating a Continental Navy (October 13) and a Marine force (November 10) as landing troops for it, but as yet the 13 colonies have not declared independence, and both the British (June 12) and American (July 15) governments make laws. On July 6, Congress issues the Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms and on August 23, King George III of Great Britain declares the American colonies in rebellion, announcing it to Parliament on November 10. On June 17, two months into the colonial siege of Boston, at the Battle of Bunker Hill, just north of Boston, British forces are victorious, but only after suffering severe casualties and after Colonial forces run out of ammunition, Fort Ticonderoga is taken by American forces in New York Colony's northern frontier, and American forces unsuccessfully invade Canada, with an attack on Montreal defeated by British forces on November 13 and an attack on Quebec repulsed December 31.\nHuman knowledge and mastery over nature advanced when James Watt built a successful prototype of a steam engine, and a scientific expedition continued as Captain James Cook claims the South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands in the south Atlantic Ocean for Britain. Nature's power over humanity is dramatically demonstrated when the Independence Hurricane (August 29 \u2013 September 13) devastates the east coast of North America, killing 4,173, and a smallpox epidemic begins in New England. Smallpox vaccine was then developed by Edward Jenner.\nDeaths.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

An estimated 141.8\u00a0million births and 54.0\u00a0million deaths took place in 2008. The average global life expectancy was 69.3 years, an increase of 0.3 years from 2007. The estimated number of global refugees decreased from 11.4\u00a0million to 10.5\u00a0million by the end of the year. The largest sources of refugees were Afghanistan with 2.8\u00a0million people and Iraq with 1.9\u00a0million people.\nConflicts.\nThere were 37 conflicts in 2008 that resulted in at least 25 fatalities, five of which resulted in at least 1,000 fatalities: the Iraqi insurgency, the Taliban insurgency, conflict with the Pakistani Taliban, Eelam War IV in Sri Lanka, and the Somali Civil War. A border conflict broke out for two days between Djibouti and Eritrea, ending with Eritrean occupation of the disputed area, Ras Doumeira. This was the first conflict in four years where two sovereign states fought each other directly. The Russo-Georgian War occurred in August when Georgia engaged in warfare with the breakaway state South Ossetia following a series of skirmishes. Russia backed South Ossetia and sent 10,000 soldiers into the fight, progressing further into Georgia until a ceasefire was established. Two separatist rebel groups escalated conflict in India: Dima Halam Daogah sought a Dimasa state and the United National Liberation Front sought a Manipuri state.\nPeace talks were held between Uganda and the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) to end the LRA's insurgency, but LRA leader Joseph Kony refused to attend a final peace agreement and government operations against the LRA resumed in December. Peace talks were also held for the Central African Bush War and the Somali Civil War, but rebels were unable to reach final agreements in these conflicts. The National Forces of Liberation resumed its insurgency in Burundi when peace talks collapsed in January, but a ceasefire was established in December. Progress was made toward peace in the First Ivorian Civil War with preparations to integrate the Forces Nouvelles de C\u00f4te d'Ivoire into the Ivorian military.\nCulture.\nThe highest-grossing film globally in 2008 was \"The Dark Knight\", followed by \"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\" and \"Kung Fu Panda\". The best-selling album globally in 2008 was \"Viva La Vida Or Death And All His Friends\" by Coldplay, followed by \"Black Ice\" by AC/DC and \"Mamma Mia! The Movie Soundtrack\".\nEconomy.\nThe economy underwent a global financial crisis in 2008 following the American subprime mortgage crisis from the previous year, causing the worst recession since the Great Depression. The economy was affected by bank failures, stock market crashes, and credit freezes. A dramatic escalation in September prompted international efforts to restore consumer confidence and resolve credit freezes. Measures such as bailouts for financial institutions and liquidity injections were implemented throughout the year.\nGross world product increased by approximately 2.5% in 2008. International trade grew by 4.3%, slowing from the 6.4% growth in 2007. Commodity prices continued their previous upward trajectory until half way into the year when they dropped sharply. The price of oil was especially affected with its 60% drop.\nThe Follow-up International Conference on Financing for Development to Review the Implementation of the Monterrey Consensus was held in November and December in Doha to continue talks on global economic reform.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "35835", "revid": "50873787", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35835", "title": "2000 AD (comics)", "text": "British comic magazine\n2000 AD is a weekly British science fiction-oriented comic magazine. As a comics anthology it serialises stories in each issue (known as \"progs\") and was first published by IPC Magazines in 1977, the first issue dated 26 February. Since 2000, it has been published by Rebellion Developments.\n\"2000 AD\" is most noted for its \"Judge Dredd\" stories, and has been contributed to by a number of artists and writers who became renowned in the field internationally, such as Alan Moore, Dave Gibbons, Grant Morrison, Brian Bolland, Mike McMahon, John Wagner, Alan Grant and Garth Ennis. Other series in \"2000 AD\" include \"Rogue Trooper\", \"Sl\u00e1ine\", \"The Ballad of Halo Jones\", \"Strontium Dog\", \"ABC Warriors\", \"Nemesis the Warlock\" and \"Nikolai Dante\".\nHistory.\n\"2000 AD\" was initially published by IPC Magazines. IPC then shifted the title to its Fleetway comics subsidiary, which was sold to Robert Maxwell in 1987 and then to Egmont UK in 1991. Fleetway continued to produce the title until 2000, when it was bought by Rebellion Developments.\n1970s.\nPre-publication.\nIn December 1975, Kelvin Gosnell, a sub-editor at IPC Magazines, read an article in the \"London Evening Standard\" about a wave of forthcoming science fiction films, and suggested that the company might get on the bandwagon by launching a science fiction comic. IPC publisher John Sanders asked Pat Mills, a freelance writer and editor who had created \"Battle Picture Weekly\" and \"Action\", to develop it. Mills brought fellow freelancer John Wagner on board as script adviser and the pair began to develop characters. The then-futuristic name \"2000 AD\" was chosen by John Sanders, as no-one involved expected the comic to last that long. The original logo and overall look of the comic were designed by art assistant Doug Church.\nMills' experiences with \"Battle\" and \"Action\" in particular had taught him that readers responded to his anti-authoritarian attitudes. Wagner, who had written a Dirty Harry-inspired tough cop called \"One-Eyed Jack\" for \"Valiant\", saw that readers also responded to authority figures, and developed a character that took the concept to its logical extreme, imagining an ultra-violent lawman patrolling a future New York with the power to arrest, sentence, and if required execute criminals on the spot. This would allow the new comic to be as violent as \"Action\" had been \u2013 a comic which had generated much controversy \u2013 but without attracting criticism, because the violence would be committed by an officer of the law. As Sanders put it, \"The formula was simple: \"violence on the side of justice\" ... Dredd could be as violent as hell, and no one could say a thing.\"\nMeanwhile, Mills had developed a horror strip, inspired by the novels of Dennis Wheatley, about a hanging judge, called \"Judge Dread\" (after the reggae and ska artist of the same name). The idea was abandoned as unsuitable for the new comic, but the name, with a little modification, was adopted by Wagner for his ultimate lawman.\nThe task of visualising the newly named \"Judge Dredd\" was given to Carlos Ezquerra, a Spanish artist who had previously worked with Mills on \"Battle\", on a strip called \"Major Eazy\". Wagner gave Ezquerra an advertisement for the film \"Death Race 2000\", showing the character Frankenstein clad in black leather, as a suggestion for what the character should look like. Ezquerra elaborated on this greatly, adding body-armour, zips and chains, which Wagner originally thought over the top. Wagner's initial script was rewritten by Mills and drawn up by Ezquerra, but when the art came back a rethink was necessary. The hardware and cityscapes Ezquerra had drawn were far more futuristic than the near-future setting originally intended, and Mills decided to run with it and set the strip further into the future. By this stage, however, Wagner and Ezquerra had both quit.\nMills was reluctant to lose \"Judge Dredd\", and farmed the strip out to a variety of freelance writers, hoping to develop it further. Their scripts were given to a variety of artists as Mills tried to find a strip which would make a good introduction to the character, all of which meant that \"Dredd\" would not be ready for the first issue. The story chosen was one written by freelancer Peter Harris, extensively rewritten by Mills and including an idea suggested by Kelvin Gosnell, and drawn by newcomer Mike McMahon. The strip debuted in prog 2, dated 5 March 1977.\nIPC owned the rights to \"Dan Dare\", and Mills decided to revive the character to add immediate public recognition for the title. Paul DeSavery, who owned \"Dare\"'s film rights, offered to buy the new comic and give Mills and Wagner more creative control and a greater financial stake. The deal fell through, however.\nThe opening line-up.\n\"Dan Dare\" was extensively revamped to make it more futuristic. In the new stories he had been put into suspended animation and revived in the year 2177. Several artists were tried out before Mills settled on Italian artist Massimo Belardinelli, whose imaginative, hallucinatory work was fantastic at visualising aliens, although perhaps less satisfying on the hero himself. The scripts were endlessly rewritten in an attempt to make the series work, but few \"Dan Dare\" fans remember this version of the character fondly. Belardinelli and Gibbons later switched strips, with Gibbons drawing \"Dan Dare\" and Belardinelli drawing the \"Harlem Heroes\" sequel \"Inferno\". When Gibbons took over \"Dan Dare\" in prog 28 the strip was refashioned as a \"Star Trek\"-style space opera.\nMills had also created \"Harlem Heroes\", about the future sport of aeroball, a futuristic, violent version of basketball with jet-packs. Similar future sport series had been a fixture of \"Action\", and the similarly themed film \"Rollerball\" had been released the previous year. Wanting to give the new comic a distinctive look, Mills wanted to use European artists, but the work turned in on \"Harlem Heroes\" by Trigo was disappointing. Veteran British artists Ron Turner and Barrie Mitchell were tried out, but the newcomer Dave Gibbons won the editor over with his dynamic, American-influenced drawings and got the job. Mills wrote the first five episodes before handing the strip to \"Roy of the Rovers\" writer Tom Tully.\nThe other opening strips were \"M.A.C.H. 1\", a super-powered secret agent inspired by \"The Six Million Dollar Man\"; \"Invasion!\", about a \"Volgan\" (thinly disguised and originally billed as Soviet, but changed before printing to a \"neutral\" antagonist) invasion of the United Kingdom opposed by tough London lorry driver turned guerrilla fighter Bill Savage; and \"Flesh\", a strip about time-travelling cowboys farming dinosaurs for their meat.\nAfter 16 issues, Mills quit as editor and handed the reins to Kelvin Gosnell, whose idea the comic had been in the first place.\nEarly years.\nWagner returned to write \"Judge Dredd\", starting in prog 9. His \"Robot Wars\" storyline was drawn by a rotating team of artists, including McMahon, Ezquerra, Turner and Ian Gibson, and marked the point where \"Dredd\" became the most popular character in the comic, a position he has rarely relinquished. Dredd's city, which now covered most of the east coast of North America, became known as Mega-City One. Dredd had also been unmasked in issue 8 in a story drawn by Massimo Belardinelli, but the decision was made to make out that Dredd's face had been scarred and the panel had a \"censored\" banner slapped on it. After this, there were no further attempts to show Dredd's face again.\nA new story format was introduced in prog 25 \u2013 \"Tharg's Future Shocks\", one-off twist-in-the-tale stories devised by writer Steve Moore. \"2000 AD\" still uses this format as filler and to try out new talent.\nWagner introduced a new character, \"Robo-Hunter\", in 1978. The hero, Sam Slade, was a private detective-type character specialising in robot-related cases. Jos\u00e9 Ferrer was the original artist, but the editorial team were not happy with his work and quickly replaced him with Ian Gibson, who redrew parts of Ferrer's episodes before taking over himself. Gibson's imaginative, cartoony art helped drive the series' style from hard-boiled detective to surreal comedy. As the series continued Sam was joined by an idiot kit-built robot assistant, Hoagy, and after a crack-down on smoking in IPC comics, a Cuban robot cigar, Stogie, designed to help him cut down on nicotine.\nOther ongoing strips included \"The Visible Man\", detailing the misfortunes of Frank Hart, a man whose skin had been made transparent due to exposure to nuclear waste, and \"Shako\", (which followed the same formula as \"Hook Jaw\" from \"Action\" but with less success) the story of a polar bear pursued by the Army because it had swallowed a secret capsule.\n\"M.A.C.H. 1\" was killed off in 1978 but a spin-off, \"M.A.C.H. Zero\", continued into the 1980s. \"Flesh\" had a sequel in 1978, set on the prehistoric oceans, and Bill Savage appeared again in a prequel, \"Disaster 1990\", in which a nuclear explosion at the north pole had melted the polar ice-cap and flooded Britain.\nIn 1977 \"2000 AD\" launched the annual 48-page Summer Special, including a full-length \"M.A.C.H. Zero\" story drawn by O'Neill. The yearly hardcover annual also started in 1977 (cover dated 1978) and would continue till 1990 (dated 1991).\nPat Mills took over writing \"Dredd\" for a six-month \"epic\" called \"The Cursed Earth\", inspired by Roger Zelazny's \"Damnation Alley\", which took the future lawman out of the city on a humanitarian trek across the radioactive wasteland between the Mega-Cities. McMahon drew the bulk of the stories, with occasional episodes drawn by Brian Bolland. The story saw Dredd moved to the colour centre pages for the first time while \"Dan Dare\" was given the front page.\nSteve MacManus took over from Gosnell as editor in 1978, starting with prog 86, dated 14 October. In that issue \"2000\u00a0AD\" merged with \"Starlord\", a second science fiction comic which had been launched by IPC earlier that year. As Gosnell was editor of \"Starlord\" and \"2000 AD\" at the same time, \"2000 AD\" sub-editor Nick Landau largely edited the latter comic himself during this time. \"Starlord\" was cancelled after only 22 issues and merged into \"2000 AD\" from prog 86. Two \"Starlord\" strips strengthened \"2000 AD\"'s line-up: \"Strontium Dog\", a mutant bounty hunter created by Wagner and Ezquerra, and \"Ro-Busters\", a robot disaster squad created by Mills. \"Ro-Busters\" gave O'Neill the chance to spread his artistic wings and led to the popular spin-off \"ABC Warriors\". \"Strontium Dog\" and \"ABC Warriors\" continued to feature in \"2000 AD\" for the next 40 years. (A third \"Starlord\" series, \"Timequake\", only lasted for four episodes and was not renewed.) \"Dan Dare\" was suspended while \"The Cursed Earth\" was finished in time for the merger. Wagner returned to \"Dredd\" following the merger to write \"The Day the Law Died\", another six-month epic in which Mega-City One was taken over by the insane Chief Judge Cal, based on the Roman emperor Caligula.\nAnother cancelled title, \"Tornado\", was merged with \"2000 AD\" a few months later from prog 127, dated 25th August, 1979. \"Tornado\" contributed three stories to \"2000 AD\": \"Blackhawk\", an historical adventure series about a Nubian slave in the Roman Empire which took a science-fictional turn in \"2000 AD\" with him becoming a gladiator in an alien world; \"The Mind of Wolfie Smith\", a coming of age/psychic story of a runaway teenager, and \"Captain Klep\", a single-page superhero parody. These stories, unlike \"Starlord's\", did not continue for very long. The last issue titled \"2000 AD and Tornado\" was prog 177, dated 13 September 1980.\n\"2000 AD\" featured an adaptation of Harry Harrison's novel \"The Stainless Steel Rat\", written by Gosnell and drawn by Ezquerra, beginning in November 1979. Adaptations of two of Harrison's sequels, \"The Stainless Steel Rat Saves the World\" and \"The Stainless Steel Rat for President\", would follow later. The appearance of the main character, galactic thief \"Slippery\" Jim DiGriz, was based on James Coburn, evidently a favourite of Ezquerra's; Coburn was also the inspiration for \"Major Eazy\", which Ezquerra drew in \"Battle,\" as well as \"Cursed Earth Koburn\", a Dredd-universe reworking of the Major Eazy character, who first appeared in 2003. Gerry Finley-Day contributed \"The V.C.s\", a future war story inspired by the Vietnam War, drawn by McMahon, Cam Kennedy, Garry Leach and John Richardson.\nA feature of the early years of \"2000 AD\" was the opportunities it gave to young British comic artists: by the time the title celebrated its 100th issue Brian Bolland, Dave Gibbons, Ian Gibson, Mike McMahon and Kevin O'Neil were all established as regulars.\n1980s.\nIn 1980 \"Judge Dredd\" gained a new enemy. Writer John Wagner realised that Dredd's habit of shooting just about everybody he came up against meant that it was difficult to create a recurring villain. The solution was Judge Death, an undead judge from another dimension where, since all crime was committed by the living, life itself was outlawed. The law had been thoroughly enforced on his own world, and now he had come to Mega-City One to continue his work. Judge Death first appeared in an atmospheric three-parter drawn by Brian Bolland which also introduced Judge Anderson and Psi Division, a squad of judges with psychic powers.\nDredd soon began another epic journey in \"The Judge Child\". A dying Psi Division Judge had predicted disaster for Mega-City One unless it was ruled by a boy with a birthmark shaped like an eagle, so Dredd set off into the Cursed Earth, to Texas City, and into deep space in search of the boy, Owen Krysler, and his kidnappers, the Angel Gang. All of them were killed during the course of the story, however the Mean Machine was later resurrected by Krysler during \"Destiny's Angels\". \"The Judge Child\" was drawn by Bolland, Ron Smith and Mike McMahon in rotation, and the later episodes marked the beginning of Wagner's long-running writing partnership with Alan Grant. The pair would go on to write \"Strontium Dog\", \"Robo-Hunter\" and many other stories for \"2000 AD\", as well as for \"Roy of the Rovers\", \"Battle\" and the relaunched \"Eagle\" in the United Kingdom, and a number of comics in America.\nWith prog 178 all current stories, with the exception of \"Judge Dredd\", were wound up, and a new set of stories was launched simultaneously, consisting of \"Mean Arena\", set around a violent high-tech street football game, \"Meltdown Man\", whose hero was transported to a genetically engineered far future by a nuclear explosion, the return of \"Strontium Dog\" and \"Dash Decent\", a \"Flash Gordon\" parody.\nPat Mills introduced \"Comic Rock\", which was meant to be a format for short stories inspired by popular music. The first story, inspired by The Jam's \"Going Underground\", was drawn by Kevin O'Neill and featured a complicated underground travel network on a planet called \"Termight\", in which a freedom fighter called Nemesis battles the despotic Torquemada, chief of the Tube Police. All that was seen of Nemesis was the outside of his vehicle, the Blitzspear. The story was a reaction to an earlier tube chase sequence Mills and O'Neill had done in \"Ro-Busters\", which management objected to.\nThe only other \"Comic Rock\" story was a follow-up called \"Killer Watt\", in which Nemesis and Torquemada fought on a teleport system. This led to a series, \"Nemesis the Warlock\", in which it was revealed that Termight was Earth in the far future. Torquemada was changed from the Chief of Traffic Police to a despotic demagogue leading a campaign of genocide against all aliens, and Nemesis was the leader of the alien resistance. Mills and O'Neill were on a roll and produced a stream of bizarre and imaginative ideas, but ultimately O'Neill was unable to continue the level of work he was putting into it on \"2000 AD\" pay. He left to work for DC Comics in America, and was replaced on \"Nemesis\" by first Jesus Redondo and then Bryan Talbot.\n\"2000 AD\" would occasionally take a gamble on non-science fiction material. For example, \"Fiends of the Eastern Front\" was a World War II vampire story by Gerry Finley-Day and Carlos Ezquerra which was probably originally intended for \"Battle\". Its hero was a German soldier who discovered that some of his Romanian allies were vampires. Later in the war, when Romania changed sides, he was the only one who knew their secret.\nA readers' poll revealed that future war was a popular topic, so Gerry Finley-Day was asked to come up with a new war story. He, editor Steve MacManus and artist Dave Gibbons devised \"Rogue Trooper\", a \"Genetic Infantryman\" engineered to be immune to chemical warfare hunting down the traitor general who had betrayed his regiment, who debuted in 1981. He was supported by bio-chips of the personalities of three dead comrades, which, slotted into his equipment, could talk to him. Gibbons left the strip early on and was replaced by Colin Wilson, Brett Ewins and Cam Kennedy. \"Rogue Trooper\" replaced \"Meltdown Man\", which had recently ended its run.\nAnother new strip in 1981, inspired by the brief CB radio craze, was \"Ace Trucking Co.\", a comedy about pointy-headed alien space trucker Ace Garp and his crew by Wagner, Grant and Belardinelli.\nIn the \"Judge Dredd\" series, Mega-City One had grown too large and unwieldy: therefore authors Wagner and Grant they planned to cut it down to size. \"Block Mania\", in which wars broke out between rival city-blocks, turned out to be a plot orchestrated by the Russian city East-Meg One, and led directly to \"The Apocalypse War\", another six-month epic and a hard-hitting satire on the concept of mutually assured destruction. East-Meg One, protected by a warp-shield, softened up Mega-City One with nuclear warheads before invading. Dredd spearheaded the resistance, leading a small team to East-Meg territory, hijacking their nuclear bunkers and blowing East-Meg One off the face of the earth. \"The Apocalypse War\" was drawn in its entirety by Carlos Ezquerra, making a return to the character he created.\nA new writer, Alan Moore, had started contributing \"Future Shocks\" in 1980. He wrote more than fifty one-off strips over the next three years, while also contributing to various Marvel UK titles and the independent magazine \"Warrior\". In 1982 he gained his first series, \"Skizz\", a less sentimental take on the same basic plot used in \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\", set in Birmingham and influenced by Alan Bleasdale's \"Boys from the Blackstuff\". The series was drawn by Jim Baikie.\nMoore wrote another series, \"D.R. and Quinch\", spun off from a one-off \"Time Twister\". Drawn by Alan Davis, the strip featured a pair of alien juvenile delinquents with a penchant for mindless thermonuclear destruction. He went on to create \"The Ballad of Halo Jones\" with artist Ian Gibson. Halo was an everywoman in the far future, born into mass unemployment on a floating housing estate, who escaped the earth and became involved in a terrible galactic war. Three books were published, and more were planned, but Moore's demands for creator's rights and his increasing commitments to American publishers meant they never materialised.\nA new character, \"Sl\u00e1ine\", debuted in 1983, but had been in development since 1981. Created by Pat Mills and his then wife Angela Kincaid, \"Sl\u00e1ine\" was a barbarian fantasy strip based on Celtic mythology. Kincaid was a children's book illustrator who had never worked in comics before, and her opening episode was drawn and redrawn several times before the editors were satisfied. Other stories were written for artists Massimo Belardinelli and Mike McMahon, but these could not see print until Kincaid's episode was ready.\nIn 1985, after appearing as a supporting character in \"Judge Dredd\", \"Judge Anderson\" finally appeared in her own series, written by Wagner and Grant and initially drawn by Brett Ewins. New artist Glenn Fabry debuted on \"Sl\u00e1ine\", but, due to his slowness, he was rotated with David Pugh. In the \"Judge Dredd\" story \"Letter from a Democrat\", Wagner and Grant introduced a pro-democracy movement in Mega-City One, which is after all a police state. This would provide plotlines for years to come.\nIn 1986 the comic reached its 500th issue. A new \"Sl\u00e1ine\" story, \"Sl\u00e1ine the King\", began, entirely drawn by Fabry. Peter Milligan, a writer who had been contributing \"Future Shocks\", began two series, the bleak future war story \"Bad Company\" and a strange, psychedelic series called \"The Dead\". In 1986, \"2000 AD\" was selling 150,000 copies a week.\nIn 1987 IPC's comics division was hived off and sold to publishing magnate Robert Maxwell as Fleetway. \"2000 AD\" was revamped, with a larger page size and full process colour on the covers and centre pages. Richard Burton became editor. Kevin O'Neill returned for a short \"Nemesis\" series called \"Torquemada the God\". Not long after came the debut of \"Zenith\", \"2000 AD\"'s first serious superhero strip, by new writer Grant Morrison and artist Steve Yeowell. The title character was a shallow pop singer with superhuman powers, caught up in the intrigues of a 1960s generation of superhumans and the machinations of some Lovecraftian elder gods.\nWagner and Grant began a new \"Dredd\" Epic, \"Oz\", featuring Chopper, a popular supporting character. Chopper was a skysurfer who had been imprisoned for competing in an illegal surfing competition a few years previously. A legal \"Supersurf\" race was being held in Oz, the future Australia, and Chopper escaped to compete. Dredd also went to Oz, partly to deal with Chopper, but mostly to investigate the Judda, a clone army created by Mega-City One's former chief genetic engineer. The Judda were defeated, and Chopper narrowly lost the race to Jug McKenzie. Dredd was waiting at the finish line, but McKenzie distracted him and allowed Chopper to escape into the outback. This ending was apparently the cause of some dispute between Wagner and Grant, and was a contributing factor (it was \"The Last American\", a mini series for Epic Comics which would mark the end) in ending their regular writing partnership. Wagner kept \"Dredd\", while Grant continued \"Strontium Dog\" and \"Judge Anderson\". However the pair would still come together for occasional collaborations.\nThe \"Oz\" storyline had some lasting implications. Kraken, a Judda cloned from the same genetic material as Dredd, was captured by Justice Department, who had plans for him. Chopper also spun off into his own series, written by Wagner and drawn by Colin MacNeil.\nThe \"ABC Warriors\" finally had their own series again in 1987 as a spin-off from \"Nemesis\". This was written, as ever, by Pat Mills, and drawn by two artists in rotation, newcomer Simon Bisley and science fiction artist S.M.S.\nIn 1988 Grant and artist Simon Harrison began a new \"Strontium Dog\" story, \"The Final Solution\". It took nearly two years to complete, and ended with the death of Johnny Alpha, who sacrificed his life to save mutants from extermination. Original artist Carlos Ezquerra did not agree with the decision to kill the character off, and refused to draw it.\nThe number of colour pages was increased, allowing for one complete strip per issue to be painted. Initially the colour pages were reserved for \"Judge Dredd\", but were later given over to a new \"Sl\u00e1ine\" story, \"The Horned God\", fully painted by Simon Bisley. The series was collected as a series of three graphic novels, then as a single volume, and has remained in print ever since.\nIn 1989 the colour pages were increased again, allowing for three colour stories and two black and white in every issue. One of the colour series was \"Rogue Trooper: the War Machine\", written by Dave Gibbons and painted by Will Simpson. The original \"Rogue Trooper\" series had run out of steam after the Traitor General had been dealt with, though continued with Rogue's adventures on Horst and the \"Hit\" series, so Gibbons revamped the concept, creating a different genetic infantryman, Friday, in a different war, albeit in the same universe.\nOne of the black and white stories, \"The Dead Man\", was a low-key beginning for a major event. In the Cursed Earth, villagers come across a man, burnt from head to toe, with no memory of who he is or what happened to him. As he tries to piece his memories back together, he is being hunted by the evil beings who left him in that state. A creepy, atmospheric horror-western, it was drawn by John Ridgway and written by \"Keef Ripley\", a pseudonym for John Wagner. By the end of the series the Dead Man had discovered his identity: he was Judge Dredd.\n1990s.\nAs \"The Dead Man\" ended, a new \"Judge Dredd\" story, \"Tale of the Dead Man\", explained how Dredd had ended up in that position. Dredd was getting older and the democratic movement was causing him to doubt his role, so Justice Department had groomed Kraken, the former Judda cloned from his bloodline, to replace him. Kraken was now ready for his final assessment, and Dredd himself was chosen to assess him. Although Kraken performed faultlessly, Dredd thought he perceived a hint of his former allegiance to the Judda in him, and failed him. He then resigned as a judge and took the 'Long Walk' into the Cursed Earth. There he met the Sisters of Death, and only barely survived the encounter. This could mean only one thing: Judge Death was back.\nThis set up the latest six-month epic, \"Necropolis\". After Dredd had left, Justice Department had put Kraken through one final test, and given him Dredd's badge. But the Sisters of Death, spirit beings from Judge Death's dimension, were able to use Kraken's inner conflict to take control of him and use him to bring Judge Death and the other Dark Judges back from the limbo dimension Dredd had exiled them to. The Sisters possessed all the city's judges and began to enforce Death's twisted law. Out in the Cursed Earth, Dredd had recovered his memory and returned to defeat the Dark Judges. He then tried to lance the democratic boil by holding a referendum on whether the Judges should continue to govern the city. The judges won, by a small margin on a desultory turnout, and Dredd was satisfied.\n\"2000 AD\" gained an influx of talent from other comics. Garth Ennis and John Smith had come to prominence writing for \"Crisis\", a \"2000 AD\" spin-off for older readers, while artists Jamie Hewlett and Philip Bond were the stars of \"Deadline\", an independent comics and popular culture magazine founded by Steve Dillon and Brett Ewins. Smith created \"Indigo Prime\", a multi-dimensional organisation that polices reality, whose most memorable story was \"Killing Time\", a time travel story featuring Jack the Ripper. Garth Ennis and Philip Bond contributed \"Time Flies\", a time-travel comedy, and Hewlett was paired with writer Peter Milligan for the surreal \"Hewligan's Haircut\". Writer John Tomlinson and artist Simon Jacob created \"Armoured Gideon\", an action-comedy series about a giant killer robot charged with keeping demons from invading earth.\nThe \"Judge Dredd Megazine\", a monthly title set in the world of Dredd, was launched in October 1990. With John Wagner focusing his attentions there, Garth Ennis became the regular writer of Dredd in the weekly.\nAmerican writer Michael Fleisher, who had written \"The Spectre\" and \"Jonah Hex\" in the 1970s, was recruited to write the continuing adventures of the new \"Rogue Trooper\", along with several other strips, none of which went down very well. Another new writer who failed to set \"2000 AD\" on fire was Mark Millar, whose revival of \"Robo-Hunter\" was particularly unpopular. Millar has since gone on to become a successful writer of American superhero comics such as \"The Authority\" and \"The Ultimates\".\n\"2000 AD\" went all-colour about this time (prog 723, dated 23 March 1991), in response to a short-lived new colour weekly, \"Toxic!\", launched by Pat Mills and many of the core \"2000 AD\" team of creators. \"Toxic!\" only lasted 31 issues but many of the creators who had worked on the comic eventually found their way to work for \"2000 AD\". \"Button Man\", a contemporary thriller by John Wagner and Arthur Ranson, was originally intended for \"Toxic!\" but ended up in \"2000 AD\".\nA new \"ABC Warriors\" series, written by Mills and Tony Skinner and painted by Kev Walker, began in 1991, in which Deadlock took over the warriors with his \"Khaos\" philosophy.\nThe old IPC strip \"Kelly's Eye\" was revived, by the new creative team of Alan McKenzie, Brett Ewins, and Zac Sandler, in 1993, when the publishers realized they no longer had the rights to the character.\nRobert Maxwell died in late 1991, and Fleetway was merged with London Editions, a Danish-owned company that owned rights to Disney characters, to become Fleetway Editions.\nIn 1992, \"2000 AD\" and the \"Judge Dredd Megazine\" ran their first crossover story, \"Judgement Day\", in which zombies overran Mega-City One. Written by Garth Ennis and drawn by Carlos Ezquerra, Peter Doherty, Dean Ormston and Chris Halls, the story teamed Judge Dredd with Johnny Alpha through the medium of time travel. John Smith and artist Paul Marshall created \"Firekind\", a slow-paced story about dragons and alien societies, which was accidentally published with its episodes in the wrong order.\nThe \"Strontium Dog\" world was eventually spun out to encompass a wider field, gaining the plural name \"Strontium Dogs\" \u2013 characters such as female vampire Durham Red, the albino Feral Jackson, and former Johnny Alpha sidekick The Gronk \u2013 the latter, normally a timid creature with weak \"heartses\", became a gung-ho action character upon learning of Alpha's death. However, in the 12-parter \"The Darkest Star\", it transpires that the one to \"actually\" kill him was the Gronk himself; changed into a form designed by a cadre of Lyran necromancers to bring him endless agony, Alpha asked his friend to end his torment.\nThe \"Summer Offensive\" was an eight-week experiment in 1993, when new editor Alan McKenzie gave free rein to writers Grant Morrison, Mark Millar and John Smith, to a mixed reception. Morrison wrote a Dredd story, \"Inferno\", and a drug-influenced comedy adventure, \"Really &amp; Truly\". Smith contributed \"Slaughterbowl\", in which convicted criminals on dinosaurs are pitted against each other in a deadly sport, with the survivor being paroled for a year and granted wealth \u2013 but being forced to enter the Slaughterbowl again the next year. Millar wrote \"Maniac 5\", an action-packed series about a remote controlled war-robot. During this run was a satire of British tabloid attitudes titled \"Big Dave\", written by Morrison and Millar and drawn by Steve Parkhouse.\nJohn Tomlinson became editor in 1994, and a second crossover between \"2000 AD\" and the \"Megazine\", \"Wilderlands\", began. Written by Wagner and drawn by Ezquerra, Mick Austin and Trevor Hairsine, it followed on from \"Mechanismo\", a series of stories in the \"Megazine\" in which Justice Department, opposed by Dredd, tried to introduce robot judges. With Wagner writing, \"Judge Dredd\" was again the flagship strip.\nFormer \"Megazine\" editor David Bishop became editor of the weekly in 1996 but sales continued to decline. Unsuccessful series were dropped, and a number of new series were tried out, some more successful than others. Writer Dan Abnett introduced \"Sinister Dexter\" in 1996, a strip about two hitmen influenced by the film \"Pulp Fiction\", which became a regular feature. In 1997, writer Robbie Morrison and artist Simon Fraser, who had worked with Bishop on the \"Megazine\", created \"Nikolai Dante\", a swashbuckling series set in future Russia starring a thief and ladies' man who discovers he's the illegitimate scion of an aristocratic dynasty. There were also gimmicks, like the \"sex issue\", sold in a clear plastic wrapper, \"The Spacegirls\", a series attempting to cash in on the popularity of the Spice Girls, \"B.L.A.I.R. 1\", a parody of Tony Blair based on \"M.A.C.H. 1\", and an adaptation of the Danny Boyle film \"A Life Less Ordinary\".\nA new \"Dredd\" epic, \"Doomsday\", appeared in 1999 and again ran in both \"2000 AD\" and the \"Megazine\". Wagner had been laying the foundations for this story for several years, introducing the main villain, semi-robotic gang lord Nero Narcos, and supporting characters like Judge Edgar of the Public Surveillance Unit, and Galen DeMarco, a former judge who had quit after falling in love with Dredd and become a private eye.\n1999 also saw the return of another character, \"Nemesis the Warlock\". After a break of ten years, writer Pat Mills decided to bring the story to an end with \"The Final Conflict\". The series was drawn by Henry Flint in a style that recalled Kevin O'Neill's early work on the series, as well as Simon Bisley's \"ABC Warriors\" work.\nThe decade ended with a special 100-page issue called \"Prog 2000\". Behind a cover by Brian Bolland, \"Nemesis\" wrapped up for good in a final episode drawn by Kevin O'Neill. War broke out in \"Nikolai Dante\", and writer Gordon Rennie and artist Mark Harrison introduced future war story \"Glimmer Rats\". Another old favourite, \"Strontium Dog\", was revived by Wagner and Ezquerra, telling new stories of Johnny Alpha set before his death, with the conceit that previous stories had been \"folklore\" and the new stories were \"what really happened\", allowing Wagner to revise continuity.\n2000s.\nThe publisher has been owned by Rebellion Developments since 2000, with editors Andy Diggle and (since 2002) Matt Smith at the helm. Rebellion continues to develop stories (and computer games) based on classic characters such as \"Rogue Trooper\" and \"Judge Dredd\", and has also introduced a roster of new series including \"Shakara\", \"The Red Seas\" and \"Caballistics, Inc.\". It has also published a tie-in to the film \"Shaun of the Dead\" in a story written by Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright.\nThe comic continues to uncover new British talents, including Boo Cook, Dom Reardon and Al Ewing. It has also benefited from an improved dollar-pound exchange rate that has meant the comic can now afford to re-employ some of the talent thought lost to America.\nA number of shorter self-contained stories, partly created by the new wave of talent, have run including \"London Falling\", \"Stone Island\" and \"Zombo\". Other developments include a revamping of the \"Judge Dredd Megazine\" which has included a section acting as a showcase for British small press comics. Starting in program 1500 was the Judge Dredd story \"The Connection\", a \"prelude\" to a 23-part Judge Dredd epic \"Origins\" which filled in a lot of the details about Dredd's past.\nIn prog 1526, dated 28 February 2007, \"2000 AD\" celebrated their 30th anniversary. The issue saw the start of two new storylines: \"Nikolai Dante\" (by Robbie Morrison and Simon Fraser) and \"Savage\" (by Pat Mills and Charlie Adlard), along with a one-off episode of \"Flesh\" (by Pat Mills and Ramon Sola). The run-up to this saw the first arcs of new series \"Stickleback\" and \"Kingdom\".\n\"2000 AD\" was also made available online through Clickwheel, another Rebellion Developments-owned firm. Starting in December 2007, the latest issue was made available to download as a PDF. In early 2008 it was announced that an archive of the 2007 issues would be added to the service. The Clickwheel Comics Reader was launched in July 2008 which would allow the digital versions of the comics to be downloaded and read on the iPhone and iPod Touch.\n2010s.\nOn 19 March 2012 the Royal Mail launched a special stamp collection to celebrate Britain's rich comic book history, which included \"2000\u00a0AD\".\nIn 2015 a documentary about the history of the comic was made, called \"Future Shock! The Story of 2000AD\".\nOn 1 October 2016, signings were held at comic shops in the UK, Ireland, Australia and the US to mark the publication of the 2000th prog. In the same week a 40th birthday convention was announced, which was held in Hammersmith, London in February 2017. At the convention itself, it was announced by the Kingsley brothers that Rebellion would be willing to speak to outside software developers on developing \"2000 AD\"'s intellectual property. In the same year, former editor Steve MacManus published his memoirs, \"The Mighty One: My Life Inside The Nerve Centre\".\nIn 2017, founding editor Pat Mills published his memoirs, \"Be Pure! Be Vigilant! Behave! 2000 AD and Judge Dredd: The Secret History\". Later in that year, Hachette Partworks began publishing ', initially an 80-volume fortnightly series of hardback books featuring classic stories from the first 40 years of the comic. Now the Collection has been extended to 180 volumes. This followed the success of ', which had started in 2015 and later been extended to 90 volumes.\nIn June 2018 (July in the United States) a special issue was published, the \"2000 AD Sci-Fi Special 2018\", which contained stories written and illustrated entirely by women.\nStarting in May 2019, \"2000 AD\" began publishing periodic \"all ages\" issues every quarter, marketed as \"2000 AD Regened\", and targeted at younger readers. In these sixteen issues, \"Judge Dredd\" was replaced by \"Cadet Dredd\" stories. This lasted until November 2023.\nLists of stories.\nWikimedia Commons has the following indexes:\nCrossovers.\nAlthough there is no overall shared universe containing all \"2000 AD\" stories, some stories spin-off or crossover into other stories. These include the numerous stories that occur in the Judge Dredd universe. Many stories by Pat Mills, which are frequently interlinked, link into the Dredd universe as well, though have been partially retconned by the writer. Many stories written by Ian Edginton feature shared themes and references.\nEditors.\nA long-running theme is that the editor of \"2000 AD\" is Tharg the Mighty, a green extraterrestrial from Betelgeuse who terms his readers \"Earthlets\". Tharg uses other unique alien expressions and even appears in his own comic strips. Readers sometimes play along with this; for example, in prog 201 a pair of readers wrote to Tharg claiming that they preferred to be called \"Terrans\"; the resulting controversy ended in Tharg allowing readers to vote for the preferred term in prog 229. In prog 240 Tharg announced that the result was a draw, and \"Terran\" became an accepted term for readers' letters in the Nerve Centre. In similar vein, Tharg used to draw distinction between male and female letter-writers with \"Earthlet\" and \"Earthlette\" until a letter was printed in Prog 314 complaining about the use, and Tharg agreed to use \"Earthlet\" (or \"Terran\") regardless of gender. From prog 531 the term \"Earthlette\" was reintroduced.\nAnother running theme is Tharg's use of robots to draw and write the strips, which bear a marked resemblance to the actual writers and artists. A fictional reason for Tharg to use mechanical assistance was given when the robots \"went on strike\" (reflecting real-life industrial action that occasionally halted IPC's comics production during the 1970s and 1980s). Tharg wrote and drew a whole issue himself, but when he ran it through the quality-control \"Thrill-meter\", the device melted down on extreme overload. The offending issue had to be taken away, by blindfolded security guards, to a lead-lined vault where there was no danger of anyone seeing it accidentally.\n&lt;section begin=tharg /&gt;\nThe role of Tharg has been performed by the following editors:\nStarting in December 2004, an additional editor's note, titled \"Damage Control\", began appearing in the legal fine print at the bottom of the first page of every issue. This editor's note is written not from the perspective of Tharg but from that of Matt Smith, the sitting editor since \"Damage Control\" started.\nContributors.\nWell-known contributors to \"2000 AD\" include:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMany of these have since moved on to work for American publishers such as DC Comics (especially the Vertigo and Wildstorm imprints) and Marvel Comics.\nAudio adaptations.\nIn 2021, Rebellion Publishing and Penguin Random House released five audio drama adaptations of classic \"2000 AD\" stories:\nVideo game adaptations.\nThe first \"2000AD\" video games for 8-bit computers were two games based on \"Strontium Dog\" published by Quicksilva in 1984 for the ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64.\nMelbourne House released the first \"Judge Dredd\" game on the Commodore 64 in 1986 and ZX Spectrum the following year. The second \"Judge Dredd\" game was published by Virgin Games in 1991 for the Amiga, Atari ST, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, and ZX Spectrum platforms.\nMartech produced two titles, \"Nemesis the Warlock\" and \"Sl\u00e1ine\", while Piranha Software only published one \"2000AD\" video game, \"Rogue Trooper\" (written by Design Design) it had games based on \"Judge Death\" and \"Halo Jones\" in development which were never released.\nKrisalis Software released another adaptation of \"Rogue Trooper\" for the Amiga and Atari ST in 1991, and the merchandising that accompanied the 1995 \"Judge Dredd\" film included tie-in games for the IBM PC (MS-DOS), Game Boy, Game Gear, PlayStation, Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo Entertainment System.\nA \"Judge Dredd\" arcade game was created but never completed nor released. It can be found online, where it is available for free, but requires an arcade / coin-op emulator. It features Mean Machine and other Angel Gang members.\nA \"Judge Dredd Pinball\" game was released for MS-DOS in 1998. The same year saw the release of a Judge Dredd videogame for the Sony PlayStation which was developed by Gremlin Interactive and published by Activision.\nWith the purchase of \"2000 AD\" by Rebellion Developments, a computer game company, several more \"2000 AD\"-linked games have been released or are under development. \"\" was released in 2003 and \"Rogue Trooper\" followed in 2006 for the Xbox, PlayStation 2 and Microsoft Windows. An updated version for the Wii entitled \"Rogue Trooper: Quartz Zone Massacre\" was released in December 2009.\nA licensed Judge Dredd choose your own adventure style game \"Judge Dredd: Countdown Sector 106\" was released in 2012 by Australian and UK-based Tin Man Games for iOS, subsequently for Google Play and Steam.\nAwards.\nAlthough the various stories and creators have also won awards, (see the various entries for details) the comic itself has its own trophies:\nRelated publications.\nFanzines.\n\"2000 AD\" has an extremely lively and thriving fanbase, which has produced a number of independent fanzines.\nIn 1998 W.R. Logan, frustrated at the lack of activity from the comic's publishers both in promoting the title and also in making best use of new talents, decided to create an independent title using \"2000 AD\" copyrighted characters and situations. This was titled \"Class of '79\", named after the year of Dredd's graduation from the Academy of Law \u2013 2079. The first couple of issues contained work from now-professional comics creators Rufus Dayglo, Boo Cook, Henry Flint and PJ Holden and won the best Self Published/Independent Comic Award at the 1999 National Comics Awards.\nIn 2001, Andrew J. Lewis created \"Zarjaz\" comic, with strips featuring characters from a variety of \"2000 AD\" stories. There were also interviews with Alan Grant, Frazer Irving and Alan Moore, as well as an extensive article on breaking into comics as a writer.\nAnother long-running fanzine, dedicated to the world of Johnny Alpha, is \"Dogbreath\", originally run by the pseudonymous Dr Bob it is now being produced by FutureQuake Publishing. In 2003, Arthur Wyatt created \"FutureQuake\", a fanzine devoted to the Future Shocks format. Although \"Class of '79\" and \"FutureQuake\" now appear to be on hiatus, the other titles are in continuous publication, \"Zarjaz\" having started up again with a new issue 1.\nIn addition, a number of small press comics have emerged from the \"2000 AD\" fanbase, including \"Solar Wind\", \"Omnivistascope\" and \"The End Is Nigh\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "35836", "revid": "7882", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35836", "title": "19-inch rack", "text": "Standard-width frame for electronic equipment\nA 19-inch rack is a standardized frame or enclosure for mounting multiple electronic equipment modules. Each module has a front panel that is wide. The 19\u00a0inch dimension includes the edges or \"ears\" that protrude from each side of the equipment, allowing the module to be fastened to the rack frame with screws or bolts. Common uses include computer servers, telecommunications equipment and networking hardware, audiovisual production gear, professional audio equipment, and scientific equipment.\nOverview and history.\nEquipment designed to be placed in a rack is typically described as rack-mount, rack-mount instrument, a rack-mounted system, a rack-mount chassis, subrack, rack cabinet, rack-mountable, or occasionally simply shelf. The height of the electronic modules is also standardized as multiples of or one rack unit or U (less commonly RU). The industry-standard rack cabinet is 42U tall; however, many data centers have racks taller than this.\nThe term relay rack appeared first in the world of telephony.\nBy 1911, the term was also being used in railroad signaling. There is little evidence that the dimensions of these early racks were standardized.\nThe 19-inch rack format with rack-units of was established as a standard by AT&amp;T around 1922 in order to reduce the space required for repeater and termination equipment in a telephone company central office. The earliest repeaters from 1914 were installed in ad hoc fashion on shelves, in wooden boxes and cabinets. Once serial production started, they were built into custom-made racks, one per repeater. But in light of the rapid growth of the toll network, the engineering department of AT&amp;T undertook a systematic redesign, resulting in a family of modular factory-assembled panels all \"designed to mount on vertical supports spaced 19&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442 inches between centers. The height of the different panels will vary... but... in all cases to be a whole multiple of &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1+3\u20444 inches.\"\nBy 1934, it was an established standard with holes tapped for 12-24 screws with alternating spacings of and . The EIA standard was revised again in 1992 to comply with the 1988 public law 100-418, setting the standard U as + + , making each \"U\" .\nThe 19-inch rack format has remained constant while the technology that is mounted within it has changed considerably and the set of fields to which racks are applied has greatly expanded. The standard rack arrangement is widely used throughout the telecommunications, computing, audio, video, entertainment and other industries, though the Western Electric 23-inch standard, with holes on centers, is still used in legacy ILEC/CLEC facilities.\nNineteen-inch racks in two-post or four-post form hold most equipment in enterprise data centers, ISP facilities, and professionally designed corporate server rooms, although hyperscale computing typically use wider racks. They allow for dense hardware configurations without occupying excessive floor space or requiring shelving.\nNineteen-inch racks are also often used to house professional audio and video equipment, including amplifiers, effects units, interfaces, headphone amplifiers, and even small-scale audio mixers. A third common use for rack-mounted equipment is industrial power, control, and automation hardware.\nTypically, a piece of equipment being installed has a front panel height less than the allotted number of Us. Thus, a 1U rackmount computer is not tall but is tall. If \"n\" is number of rack units, the ideal formula for panel height is \"h\" = 1.75\"n\" \u2212 0.031 for calculating in inches, and \"h\" = 44.45\"n\" \u2212 0.794 for calculating in millimeters. This gap allows a bit of room above and below an installed piece of equipment so it may be removed without binding on the adjacent equipment.\nEquipment mounting.\nFastening.\nOriginally, the mounting holes were tapped with a particular screw thread. When rack rails are too thin to tap, rivet nuts or other threaded inserts can be used, and when the particular class of equipment to be mounted is known in advance, some of the holes can be omitted from the mounting rails.\nThreaded mounting holes in racks where the equipment is frequently changed are problematic because the threads can be damaged or the mounting screws can break off; both problems render the mounting hole unusable. Tapping large numbers of holes that may never be used is expensive; nonetheless, tapped-hole racks are still in use, generally for hardware that rarely changes. Examples include telephone exchanges, network cabling panels, broadcast studios and some government and military applications.\nThe tapped-hole rack was first replaced by clearance-hole (Round Hole, Round Unthreaded Holes, and Versa Rail) racks. The holes are large enough to permit a bolt to be freely inserted through without binding, and bolts are fastened in place using cage nuts. In the event of a nut being stripped out or a bolt breaking, the nut can be easily removed and replaced with a new one. Production of clearance-hole racks is less expensive.\nThe next innovation in rack design has been the square-hole rack. Square-hole racks allow boltless mounting, such that the rack-mount equipment only needs to insert through and hook down into the lip of the square hole. Installation and removal of hardware in a square-hole rack is very easy and boltless, where the weight of the equipment and small retention clips are all that is necessary to hold the equipment in place. Older equipment meant for round-hole or tapped-hole racks can still be used, with the use of cage nuts made for square-hole racks.\nStructural support.\nRack-mountable equipment is traditionally mounted by bolting or clipping its front panel to the rack. Within the IT industry, it is common for network/communications equipment to have multiple mounting positions, including tabletop and wall mounting, so rack-mountable equipment will often feature L-brackets that must be screwed or bolted to the equipment prior to mounting in a 19-inch rack. With the prevalence of 23-inch racks in the Telecoms industry, the same practice is also common, but with equipment having 19-inch and 23-inch brackets available, enabling them to be mounted in existing racks.\nA key structural weakness of front-mounted support is the bending stress placed on the mounting brackets of the equipment, and the rack itself. As a result, 4-post racks have become common, featuring a mirrored pair of rear mounting posts. Since the spacing between the front and rear mounting posts may differ between rack vendors and/or the configuration of the rack (some racks may incorporate front and rear rails that may be moved forwards and backward, e.g. APC SX-range racks), it is common for equipment that features 4-post mounting brackets to have an adjustable rear bracket.\nServers and deep pieces of equipment are often mounted using rails that are bolted to the front and rear posts (as above, it is common for such rails to have an adjustable depth), allowing the equipment to be supported by four posts, while also enabling it to be easily installed and removed.\nAlthough there is no standard for the depth of equipment, nor specifying the outer width and depth of the rack enclosure itself (incorporating the structure, doors and panels that contain the mounting rails), there is a tendency for 4-post racks to be or wide, and for them to be , or deep. This of course varies by manufacturer, the design of the rack and its purpose, but through common constraining factors (such as raised-floor tile dimensions), these dimensions have become quite common. The extra width and depth enables cabling to be routed with ease (also helping to maintain the minimum bend radius for fiber and copper cables) and deeper equipment to be utilized. A common feature in IT racks is mounting positions for \"zero-U\" accessories, such as power distribution units (PDUs) and vertical cable managers and ducts, that utilize the space between the rear rails and the side of the rack enclosure.\nThe strength required of the mounting posts means they are invariably not merely flat strips but actually a wider folded strip arranged around the corner of the rack. The posts are usually made of steel of around 2\u00a0mm thickness (the official standard recommends a minimum of 1.9\u00a0mm), or of slightly thicker aluminum.\nRacks, especially two-post racks, are often secured to the floor or adjacent building structure so as not to fall over. This is usually required by local building codes in seismic zones. According to Telcordia Technologies Generic Requirements document GR-63-CORE, during an earthquake, telecommunications equipment is subjected to motions that can over-stress equipment framework, circuit boards, and connectors. The amount of motion and resulting stress depends on the structural characteristics of the building and framework in which the equipment is contained and the severity of the earthquake. Seismic racks rated according to https://, \"NEBS Requirements: Physical Protection,\" are available, with Zone 4 representing the most demanding environment.\nhttps://, \"Generic Requirements for Network Equipment in the Outside Plant (OSP),\" specifies the usable opening of seismic-compliant 19-inch racks.\nRails (slides).\nHeavy equipment or equipment that is commonly accessed for servicing, for which attaching or detaching at all four corners simultaneously would pose a problem, is often not mounted directly onto the rack but instead is mounted via rails (or slides). A pair of rails is mounted directly onto the rack, and the equipment then slides into the rack along the rails, which support it. When in place, the equipment may also then be bolted to the rack. The rails may also be able to fully support the equipment in a position where it has been slid clear of the rack; this is useful for inspection or maintenance of equipment which will then be slid back into the rack. Some rack slides even include a tilt mechanism allowing easy access to the top or bottom of rack-mounted equipment when it is fully extended from the rack.\nSlides or rails for computers and other data processing equipment such as disk arrays or routers often need to be purchased directly from the equipment manufacturer, as there is no standardization on such equipment's thickness (measurement from the side of the rack to the equipment) or means for mounting to the rail.\nA rails kit may include a cable management arm (CMA), which folds the cables attached to the server and allows them to expand neatly when the server is slid out, without being disconnected.\nComputer mounting.\nComputer servers designed for rack-mounting can include a number of extra features to make the server easy to use in the rack:\nWhen there is a large number of computers in a single rack, it is impractical for each one to have its own separate keyboard, mouse, and monitor. Instead, a KVM switch or LOM software is used to share a single keyboard/video/mouse set amongst many different computers.\nSince the mounting hole arrangement is vertically symmetric, it is possible to mount rack-mountable equipment upside-down. However, not all equipment is suitable for this type of mounting. For instance, most optical disc players will not work upside-down because the driving motor mechanism does not grip the disc.\nRack types.\nA standard 19-inch server rack cabinet is typically 42u in height, wide, and deep. This comprises a volume of 974 L, or just under a cubic meter. Newer server rack cabinets come with adjustable mounting rails allowing the user to place the rails at a shorter depth if needed. There are a multitude of specialty server racks including soundproof server racks, air-conditioned server racks, NEMA-rated, seismic-rated, open frame, narrow, and even miniature 19-inch racks for smaller applications. Cabinets are generally sized to be no wider than the standard floor tiles used in most data centers.\nRacks carrying telecom equipment like routers and switches often have extra width to accommodate the many cables on the sides.\nFour-post cabinet racks.\n\"Four-post racks\" allow for mounting rails to support the equipment at the front and rear. These racks may be open in construction without sides or doors or may be enclosed by front and/or rear doors, side panels, and tops. Most data centers use four-post racks.\nTwo-post relay racks.\n\"Two-post racks\" provide two vertical posts. These posts are typically heavy gauge metal or extruded aluminum. A top bar and wide foot connect the posts and allow the rack to be securely attached to the floor and/or roof for seismic safety. Equipment can be mounted either close to its center of gravity (to minimize load on its front panel), or via the equipment's front panel holes. The \"Relay Racks\" name comes from early two-post racks which housed telephone relay and switching equipment. Two-post racks are most often used for telecommunication installations.\nATA road case racks.\n19-inch equipment that needs to be moved often or protected from harsh treatment can be housed in a \"road case\" approved by the Air Transport Association of America (ATA), sometimes also referred to as a \"flight case\". Road cases typically have plywood sides laminated with polyvinyl chloride (PVC), extruded aluminum edges, steel corners, handles, and latches. Larger cases typically have wheels for easy transport. Road case racks come in different heights based on the 1U standard and different depths. Non-isolated cases simply mount 19-inch mounting posts inside the case. To protect equipment from shock and vibration, road rack cases use an inner and outer case. These cases can be isolated by thick layers of foam or may use spring-loaded shock mounting. Touring musicians, theatrical productions and sound and light companies use road case racks.\nRack strips used for road cases comes with 2 types: single angle and double angle. Double angle rack strips offer better structural strength and an additional mounting face for cable management or additional support for heavy equipment.\nFiberglass-reinforced plastic case racks.\nIn 1965, a durable fiber-reinforced plastic 19-inch rackmount case was patented by ECS Composites and became widely used in military and commercial applications for electronic deployment and operation. Rackmount cases are also constructed of thermo-stamped composite, carbon fiber, and DuPont's Kevlar for military and commercial uses.\nPolyethylene molded case racks.\nPortable rack cases using a rotary-molded polyethylene outer shell are a lower-cost alternative to the more durable ATA-approved case. These cases are marketed to musicians and entertainers for equipment not subject to frequent transportation and rough handling. The polyethylene shell is not fiberglass reinforced and is not rigid. The shape of small cases is maintained by the rack rails and the cover seal extrusions alone. Larger cases are further reinforced with additional plywood or sheet metal. The outer shell is frequently embossed in a self-mating pattern to combat the tendency for stacked cases to deform slightly creating a slope that encourages the upper case to slide off. The cases typically use extruded aluminum bands at the ends of the body with tongue-and-groove mating to like bands for the covers. End covers are typically secured with either a simple draw latch or a rotary cam \"butterfly\" latch, named for the shape of the twist handle.\nCooling.\nThere is no standard for airflow and cooling of rack-mounted equipment. A variety of airflow patterns can be found, including front intakes and rear exhausts, as well as side intakes and exhausts. Low-wattage devices may not employ active cooling, but use only passive thermal radiation and convection to dissipate heat.\nFor rack-mounted computer servers, devices generally intake air on the front and exhaust on the rear. This prevents circular airflows where hot exhaust air is recirculated through an adjacent device and causes overheating.\nAlthough open-frame racks are the least expensive, they also expose air-cooled equipment to dust, lint, and other environmental contamination. An enclosed sealed cabinet with forced air fans permits air filtration to protect equipment from dust.\nLarge server rooms will often group rack cabinets together so that racks on both sides of an aisle are either front-facing or rear-facing, which simplifies cooling by supplying cool air to the front of the racks and collecting hot air from the rear of the racks. These aisles may themselves be enclosed into a cold air containment tunnel so that cooling air does not travel to other parts of the building where it is not needed or mixes with hot air, making it less efficient. Raised or false floor cooling in server rooms can serve a similar purpose; they permit cooling airflow to equipment through the underfloor space to the underside of enclosed rack cabinets.\nA difficulty with forced air fan cooling in rack equipment is that fans can fail due to age or dust. The fans themselves can be difficult to replace. In the case of network equipment, it may be necessary to unplug 50 or more cables from the device, remove the device from the rack, and then disassemble the device chassis to replace the fans.\nHowever, some rack equipment has been designed to make fan replacement easy, using quick-change fan trays that can be accessed without removing the cabling or the device from the rack, and in some cases without turning off the device so that operation is uninterrupted during replacement.\nSpecifications.\nThe formal standards for a rack are available from the following:\nA rack's mounting fixture consists of two parallel metal strips (also referred to as \"posts\" or \"panel mounts\") standing vertically. The posts are each wide, and are separated by a gap of , giving an overall rack width of . The posts have holes in them at regular intervals, with both posts matching, so that each hole is part of a horizontal pair with a center-to-center distance of .\nThe holes in the posts are arranged vertically in repeating sets of three, with center-to-center separations of . The hole pattern thus repeats every .\nHoles so arranged can either be tapped (usually 10-32 UNF thread, or, less often, 6mm metric) or have square holes for cage nuts.\nRack unit.\nRacks are vertically divided into regions, in height. Each region has three complete hole pairs on each side. The holes are centered at , , and from the top or bottom of the region. Such a region is commonly known as a U, for \"unit\", RU for \"rack unit\" or, in German, HE, for \"\". Heights within racks are measured by this unit. Rack-mountable equipment is usually designed to occupy some integer number of U. For example, an oscilloscope might be 4U high. Rack-mountable computers and servers are mostly between 1U and 4U high. A blade server enclosure might require 10U.\nOccasionally, one may see fractional U devices such as a 1.5U server or devices that are just 22.5 or in width, allowing for 2 or 3 such devices to be installed side by side, but these are much less common.\nThe height of a rack can vary from a few inches, such as in a broadcast console, to a floor-mounted rack whose interior is 45 rack units () high. 42U is a common configuration. Many wall-mounted enclosures for industrial equipment use 19-inch racks.\nRelated standards.\n10-inch rack.\nSome telecommunications and networking equipment is available in a narrower 10-inch format with the same unit height as a standard 19-inch rack.\nThis standard is also gaining in popularity with hobbyists with limited space at their disposal.\n11-foot frame.\nFrames for holding rotary-dial telephone equipment such as step-by-step telephone switches were generally high. A series of studies led to the adoption of frames high, with modular widths in multiples of \u2014most often wide.\nETSI rack.\nThe ETSI rack is defined by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETS 300 119). The distance of the right edge of the right mounting rail to the left edge of the left mounting rail is . As 535\u00a0mm is very close to 21 inches, these racks are sometimes called \"21-inch racks\". The gap between the posts is . As 19-inch equipment has a maximum width of , they can easily be mounted in an ETSI rack by means of an ETSI bracket or adapter plate.\nIn contrast to the 19-inch standards, ETSI also defined the size of the rack enclosure: the four allowed widths are and two allowed depths are . Hole spacing is .\n23-inch rack.\nA rack is used for housing telephone (primarily), computer, audio and other equipment \u2013 although it is less common than the 19-inch rack. The size denotes the width of the faceplate for the installed equipment. The rack unit is a measure of vertical spacing and is common to both the 19 and 23-inch racks.\nHole spacing is either on centers (Western Electric standard), or the same as for racks ( spacing).\nOpen Rack.\nOpen Rack is a mounting system designed by Facebook's Open Compute Project that has the same outside dimensions as typical 19-inch racks (e.g. 600\u00a0mm width), but supports wider equipment modules of .\nOpenVPX.\nOpenVPX is an industry standard for modules that can be installed in chassis in defense applications. The modules can provide a variety of functions, similarly to equipment in a rack. \nEurorack.\nEurorack is a standard generally used in electronic music production to install components of a modular synthesizer, an electronic music instrument. This is achieved with a rack mounting system specific to the standard.\nEurocard.\nEurocard is an IEEE standard format for printed circuit board (PCB) cards that can be plugged together into a standard chassis which, in turn, can be mounted in a 19-inch rack. The chassis consists of a series of slotted card guides on the top and bottom, into which the cards are slid so they stand on end, like books on a shelf. At the spine of each card is one or more connectors which plug into mating connectors on a backplane that closes the rear of the chassis. Several standards such as VMEbus (Versa Module Eurocard bus), STEbus, PCI eXtensions for Instrumentation, openGear and others were developed, which share goals with Eurocard.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "35922", "revid": "40552684", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35922", "title": "American Airlines Flight 587", "text": "2001 aviation accident in New York\nAmerican Airlines Flight 587 was a regularly scheduled international passenger flight from John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York City, to Las Am\u00e9ricas International Airport, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. On November 12, 2001, the Airbus A300B4-605R flying the route crashed into the neighborhood of Belle Harbor on the Rockaway Peninsula of Queens, New York City, shortly after takeoff, killing all 251 passengers and 9 crew members aboard, as well as five people on the ground. It is the second-deadliest aviation accident to have occurred in the United States, behind the crash of American Airlines Flight 191 in 1979, and the second-deadliest aviation incident involving an Airbus A300, after Iran Air Flight 655.\nThe location of the accident, and that it took place only two months after the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center in nearby Manhattan, initially spawned fears of another terrorist attack, but the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) attributed the disaster to the first officer's overuse of rudder controls in response to wake turbulence from a preceding Japan Airlines Boeing 747-400 that took off minutes before it. According to the NTSB, the aggressive use of the rudder controls by the first officer, the result of a flawed training scenario that overexaggerated the effects of wake turbulence, stressed the vertical stabilizer until it separated from the aircraft. The airliner's two engines also separated from the aircraft before impact due to the intense forces.\nAircraft and crew.\nThe accident aircraft, registration N14053, was an Airbus A300 B4-605R delivered new to American Airlines on 12 July 1988. The aircraft's first flight was on 9 December 1987, and it was the first \"R\" model A300-600 built. On the day of the accident, it was in a two-class seating configuration with space for 251 passengers, and all seats were filled: 16 business-class seats and 235 economy-class seats. The aircraft was powered by two General Electric CF6-80C2A5 engines. On board were nine crew members, including 42-year-old Captain Edward States, who was the pilot monitoring and undertaking radio communications, and 34-year-old First Officer Sten Molin, who was the pilot flying.\nAccident.\nThe aircraft taxied to Runway 31L behind a Japan Airlines (JAL) Boeing 747-400 (JAL Flight 47) preparing for takeoff. The JAL flight was cleared for takeoff at 9:11:08\u00a0am EST. At 9:11:36, the tower controller cautioned Flight 587 about potential wake turbulence from a preceding 747.2\nAt 9:13:28, the A300 was cleared for takeoff and left the runway at 9:14:29, about one minute and 40 seconds after the JAL flight had departed. The aircraft climbed to an altitude of and then entered a climbing left turn to a heading of 220\u00b0. At 9:15:00, the captain made initial contact with the departure controller, informing him that the airplane was at and climbing to . The controller instructed the aircraft to climb to and maintain .3 The flight data recorder (FDR) showed that the events leading to the crash began when the aircraft hit wake turbulence from the JAL flight in front of it at 9:15:36. In response to the turbulence, Molin moved the rudder from the right to the left and back again in quick succession from 9:15:52, causing sideslip until the lateral force caused composite lugs that attached the vertical stabilizer to fail at 9:15:58. The stabilizer separated from the aircraft and fell into Jamaica Bay, about north of the main wreckage site.\nThe aircraft pitched downward after the stabilizer loss. As the pilots struggled to control the aircraft, it entered a flat spin. The resulting aerodynamic loads sheared both engines from the aircraft, and they fell several blocks north and east of the main wreckage site, causing minor damage to a gas station and major damage to a home and a boat. The loss of engines cut power to the FDR at 9:16:01, while the cockpit voice recorder (CVR), using an emergency bus, stopped at 9:16:14.8 upon impact with the ground. At 9:16:04, the stall warning sounded on the CVR.195 The last recorded words were those of Molin saying, \"What the hell are we into, we're stuck in it\" (9:16:07) and States replying \"Get out of it, get out of it.\" The aircraft slammed into the ground at Newport Avenue and Beach 131st Street.\nInvestigation.\nInitial reactions and investigation.\nBecause the crash occurred just two months after the September 11 attacks, which also took place in New York City, several major buildings, including the Empire State Building and the headquarters of the United Nations, were evacuated. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey closed all bridges and tunnels between Manhattan and New Jersey and suspended PATH service for a few hours; traffic was disrupted, but there was less than a typical Monday because it was Veterans Day. The New York metropolitan area's three major airports \u2013 JFK, LaGuardia, and Newark \u2013 remained closed for much of the day, leading to the cancellation of many flights. Air National Guard fighter jets patrolled U.S. airspace after the crash.\nRumors circulated that the plane had been destroyed in a terrorist plot. In May 2002, a Kuwaiti national named Mohammed Jabarah agreed to cooperate with investigators as part of a plea bargain. Among the details that Jabarah offered to authorities was a claim that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed's lieutenant had told him that Richard Reid and Abderraouf Jdey had been enlisted by al Qaeda to execute identical shoe-bombing plots as part of a second wave of attacks against the United States. According to the lieutenant, Jdey's bomb had successfully destroyed Flight 587, while Reid's attempt had been foiled. According to a Canadian government memorandum, Jdey, a naturalized Canadian citizen, was to use his Canadian passport to board the flight, but American Airlines' passenger manifest for Flight 587 did not list any passengers using Canadian passports. According to NTSB spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz, the weight of the memo's veracity was questioned, as no evidence of a terrorist traveling on board was found. The evidence suggested that the aircraft was destroyed after a piece of the tail assembly, \"the vertical fin, came off,\" while it did not indicate \"any kind of event in the cabin.\"\nNTSB investigation.\nOn the afternoon of the crash, the NTSB launched an investigation in search for a probable cause. Over the next three months, they conducted 349 interviews and collected and reconstructed pieces of the aircraft. The Airbus A300 took off shortly after a JAL Boeing 747-400 using the same runway.47 It flew into the larger jet's wake, an area of turbulent air. The first officer attempted to stabilize the aircraft with alternating aggressive rudder inputs.107 The force of the air flowing against the moving rudder stressed the aircraft's vertical stabilizer, and eventually snapped it off entirely, causing the aircraft to lose control and crash. The NTSB concluded that the enormous stress on the vertical stabilizer was due to the first officer's \"unnecessary and excessive\" rudder inputs, and not the wake turbulence caused by the 747. The NTSB further stated, \"if the first officer had stopped making additional inputs, the aircraft would have stabilized\". Contributing factors were characteristics of the Airbus A300-600's sensitive rudder system design and elements of the American Airlines Advanced Aircraft Maneuvering Training Program.\nThe manner in which the vertical stabilizer separated concerned investigators. It is connected to the fuselage with six attaching points. Each point has two sets of attachment lugs, one set made of composite material, another of aluminum, all connected by a titanium bolt; damage analysis showed that the bolts and aluminum lugs were intact, but not the composite lugs. This, coupled with two events earlier in the life of the aircraft, namely delamination in part of the vertical stabilizer prior to its delivery from Airbus's Toulouse factory, and an encounter with heavy turbulence in 1994, caused investigators to examine the use of composites. The possibility that the composite materials might not be as strong as previously supposed was a cause of concern, as they are used in other areas of the plane, including the engine mounting and the wings. Tests carried out on the vertical stabilizers from the accident aircraft, and from another similar aircraft, found that the strength of the composite material had not been compromised, and the NTSB concluded that the material had failed because it had been stressed beyond its design limit.\nThe crash was witnessed by hundreds of people, 349 of whom gave accounts of what they saw to the NTSB. About half (52%) reported a fire or explosion before the plane hit the ground. Others stated that they saw a wing detach from the aircraft, when in fact it was the vertical stabilizer.\nAfter the crash, Floyd Bennett Field's empty hangars were used as a makeshift morgue for the identification of crash victims.\nFindings.\nAccording to the official accident report, the first officer repeatedly moved the rudder from fully left to fully right. This caused increasing sideslip angles. The resulting hazardous sideslip angle led to extremely high aerodynamic loads that separated the vertical stabilizer. If the first officer had stopped moving the rudder at any time before the vertical stabilizer failed, the aircraft would have leveled out on its own, and the accident would have been avoided. The aircraft performance study indicated that when the vertical stabilizer finally detached, the aerodynamic loads caused by the first officer's actions produced of force on the rudder, meaning that the vertical stabilizer did not fail until far in excess of the of force defined by the design envelope. The vertical stabilizer's structural performance was determined to be consistent with design specifications and to have exceeded certification requirements.\nContributing factors identified in the report included: First, the first officer's predisposition to overreact to wake turbulence; second, training provided by American Airlines that could have encouraged pilots to use the rudder this aggressively; third, the first officer likely not understanding an airplane's response to full rudder at high airspeeds or the mechanism by which the rudder rolls a transport-category airplane; and finally, light rudder pedal forces and small pedal displacement of the A300-600 rudder pedal system that increased the airplane's susceptibility to rudder misuse.151\nMost aircraft require increased pressure on the rudder pedals to achieve the same amount of rudder control at a higher speed. The Airbus A300 and later Airbus A310 models do not operate on a fly-by-wire flight control system, but instead use conventional mechanical flight controls. The NTSB asserted that the A300-600 rudder control system was vulnerable to excessive rudder inputs. The Allied Pilots Association, in its submission to the NTSB, argued that the unusual sensitivity of the rudder mechanism amounted to a design flaw that Airbus should have communicated to the airline. The main rationale for their position came from a 1997 report that referenced 10 incidents in which A300 tail fins had been stressed beyond their design limitation.\nAirbus charged that the crash was mostly American Airlines' fault, arguing that the airline did not train its pilots properly about the characteristics of the rudder. Aircraft tail fins are designed to withstand full rudder deflection in one direction when below maneuvering speed, but this does not guarantee that they can withstand an abrupt shift in rudder from one direction to the other, let alone multiple abrupt shifts, like those generated by the first officer on this flight. The NTSB indicated that American Airlines' Advanced Aircraft Maneuvering Program (AAMP) tended to exaggerate the effects of wake turbulence on large aircraft, creating a simulation scenario whereby turbulence from a 747 creates a 90\u00b0 roll (rather than the likely 5 to 10\u00b0 roll, though not explaining this to the pilots) to maximize the training challenge. Therefore, pilots were being inadvertently trained to react more aggressively than was necessary. According to author Amy Louise Fraher, this led to concerns of whether it was appropriate for the AAMP to be placing such importance on \"the role of flight simulators in teaching airplane upset recovery at all.\" Fraher states that the key to understanding the crash of Flight 587 ultimately lay in \"how the accident pilots' expectations about aircraft performance were erroneously established through 'clumsy' flight simulator training in American's AAMP.\"\nStatement of probable cause.\nFrom the NTSB report of the accident:\nThe National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the in-flight separation of the vertical stabilizer as a result of the loads beyond ultimate design that were created by the first officer's unnecessary and excessive rudder pedal inputs. Contributing to these rudder pedal inputs were characteristics of the Airbus A300-600 rudder system design and elements of the American Airlines Advanced Aircraft Maneuvering Program (AAMP).160\nSince the NTSB's report, American Airlines has modified its pilot training program.\nVictims.\nAll 260 people aboard the plane died in the crash. Five bystanders on the ground were also killed. One of the victims, Hilda Yolanda Mayol, had previously survived the September 11 attacks, having escaped from the North Tower of the World Trade Center. She was traveling with her mother and children, attempting to escape the trauma of the attacks. Another victim of the crash was Ashot Melikjanyan, a Soviet-Armenian former actor who later became a naturalized American citizen.\nFive residents of Belle Harbor lost their lives in the crash: Thomas (79) and Helen Concannon (73), an elderly married couple; Kathleen Lawler (48) and her son Christopher Lawler (24) \u2014a second-year law student at St. John's University\u2014, and Franco \"Frank\" Pomponio (45). Frank Pomponio's wife, daughter, and dog survived by escaping through the rear of their home, quickly navigating through billowing smoke. Frank, however, was directly struck and subsequently trapped while sleeping in the upstairs bedroom. Moments later the family dog, Dakota (5), reportedly ran back into the wreck to find Frank. She disappeared in the flames but was found hours later in stable condition albeit with her paws severely damaged. Frank is also survived by a son, Michael, who was attending SUNY Albany at the time of the incident. Evidently a close knit community, Kathleen Lawler's two surviving daughters, Katelyn and Jennifer, were attending Bishop Kearney High School alongside Frank's daughter, Jennifer Pomponio. All three were members of the school's varsity softball team. Jennifer was getting ready to leave for practice to join the Lawler sisters just before the plane struck. Kathleen is also survived by her husband, Thomas Lawler, and their son, Brendan Lawler. Additionally, Frank Pomponio was a well-regarded and beloved coach of Bishop Kearney\u2019s varsity softball team. Tragically, many students at Bishop Kearney had recently lost relatives in the 9/11 attacks which had occurred only two months prior. As reported by the \"New York Post\", a total of 7 individuals linked to Bishop Kearney passed away in connection with both incidents.\nA few months after the incident, Pomponio's wife, Geraldine \"Gerry\" Pomponio banded together with a group of community leaders committed to fighting for reduced airplane traffic over residential areas. She stated in an interview with the \"Queens Chronicle\", \"It's sad that the FAA hasn't brought about a change in a timely way\". She added, \"It's disturbing. They made a claim, and they're not keeping up with their promise\". Months ago in a community meeting, FAA officials said they would begin re-routing many departing flights from JFK Airport so that most planes would fly over water and parkland instead of over homes. However, commercial airlines continued to fly over the densely populated neighborhoods of the Rockaway Peninsula, leaving residents feeling frustrated and ignored.Las Am\u00e9ricas International Airport officials created a private area for those who had come to the airport to meet passengers, some of whom were unaware that the airliner had crashed. The authorities at John F. Kennedy International Airport used the JFK Ramada Plaza to house relatives and friends of the victims of the crash. The family crisis center later moved to the Javits Center in Manhattan.\nCultural background.\nIn 2001, 51 weekly direct flights were made between JFK and the Dominican Republic, with additional flights in December. Most of the flights were offered by American Airlines,1 and the airline was described as having a virtual monopoly on the route.2 Around 90% of the passengers on the accident flight were of Dominican descent.\n\"The Guardian\" described the flight as having \"cult status\" in Washington Heights, a Dominican area of Manhattan. Belkis Lora, a relative of a passenger on Flight 587, said, \"Every Dominican in New York has either taken that flight or knows someone who has. It gets you there early. At home, there are songs about it.\" Seth Kugel, writing for \"The New York Times\", said, \"For many Dominicans in New York, these journeys home are the defining metaphor of their complex push-pull relationship with their homeland; they embody, vividly and poignantly, the tug between their current lives and their former selves. That fact gave Monday's tragedy a particularly horrible resonance for New York's Dominicans.\"1 He added, \"Even before Monday's crash, Dominicans had developed a complex love-hate relationship with American Airlines, complaining about high prices and baggage restrictions even while favoring the carrier over other airlines that used to travel the same route.\"2 David Rivas, a New York City travel agency owner, said, \"For the Dominican to go to Santo Domingo during Christmas and summer is like the Muslims going to Mecca.\"4\nThe crash did not affect bookings for the JFK\u2013Santo Domingo route. Dominicans continued to book travel on the flights4 until American Airlines ended services between JFK and Santo Domingo on April 1, 2013.\nThe intersection of 181st St &amp; Amsterdam Ave in Washington Heights is named \"Flight 587 Way\" in honor of the victims.\nMemorial.\nA memorial was constructed in Rockaway Park, the community adjoining Belle Harbor to the east, in memory of the 265 victims of the crash. It is situated beside the Rockaway Beach and Boardwalk at the south end of Beach 116th Street, a major commercial street in the area. It was dedicated on November 12, 2006, the fifth anniversary of the accident, in a ceremony attended by then-Mayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg. A ceremony commemorating the disaster is held annually at the memorial every November 12, featuring a reading of the names of those killed aboard the aircraft and on the ground, with a formal moment of silence observed at 9:16\u00a0am, the estimated time of the crash. The memorial wall, designed by Dominican artist Freddy Rodr\u00edguez and Situ Studio, has windows and a doorway looking toward the nearby Atlantic Ocean and angled toward the Dominican Republic. It is inscribed with the names of the victims. Atop the memorial is a quotation, in both Spanish and English, from Dominican poet Pedro Mir: \"\" (which translates to \"Afterwards I want nothing more than peace\").\nIn a ceremony held on May 6, 2007, at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, 889 unidentified fragments of human remains of the victims of the crash were entombed in a group of four mausoleum crypts.\nDocumentaries.\nSeveral documentaries have been made concerning the accident.\nA 2006 episode of the National Geographic Channel program \"Seconds From Disaster\" examined the Flight 587 accident in detail. The episode was titled \"Plane Crash in Queens\" (also known as \"New York Air Crash\").\nA 2006 episode of \"Modern Marvels\" on The History Channel aired an episode titled \"Engineering Disasters 20\", which featured detailed information on Flight 587. The BBC program \"Horizon\" also created an episode about the crash.\nThe Discovery Channel Canada / National Geographic series \"Mayday\" (also called \"Air Crash Investigation\" or \"Air Emergency\") dramatized the accident in the Season 13. Episode 5 titled \"Queens Catastrophe\". \nAn episode of \"Aircrash Confidential\" on Discovery Channel also featured Flight 587. The episode was titled \"Pilot Error\". A 2011 episode of \"Why Planes Crash\" featured Flight 587. The episode was titled \"Human Error\" and was aired on MSNBC. A 2020 episode of \"Black Box Down\" featured Flight 587.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n\u00a0This article incorporates https:// from \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It began on January 1, 1001 (MI) and ended on December 31, 2000 (MM), (11th to 20th centuries; in astronomy: JD \u2013 ).\nIt encompassed the High and Late Middle Ages of the Old World, the Islamic Golden Age and the period of Renaissance, followed by the early modern period, characterized by the European wars of religion, the Age of Enlightenment, the Age of Discovery and the colonial period. Its final two centuries coincide with modern history, characterized by industrialization, the rise of nation states, the rapid development of science, widespread education, and universal health care and vaccinations in the developed world. The 20th century saw increasing globalization, most notably the two World Wars and the subsequent formation of the United Nations. 20th-century technology includes powered flight, television and semiconductor technology, including integrated circuits. The term \"Great Divergence\" was coined to refer the unprecedented cultural and political ascent of the Western world in the second half of the millennium, emerging by the 18th century as the most powerful and wealthy world civilization, having eclipsed Qing China, Edo Japan, the Islamic world and India. This allowed the colonization by European countries of much of the world during this millennium, including the Americas, Africa, Oceania, and South and Southeast Asia.\nWorld population grew without precedent over the millennium, from about 310 million in 1001 to about 6 billion in 2000. The population growth rate increased dramatically during this time; world population approximately doubled to 600 million by 1700, and doubled more than three more times by 2000, ultimately reaching about 1.8% per year in the second half of the 20th century.\n see also Crusades, Mongol invasions\nCalendar.\nThe Julian calendar was used in Europe at the beginning of the millennium, and all countries that once used the Julian calendar had adopted the Gregorian calendar by the end of it. For this reason, the end date of the 2nd millennium is usually calculated based on the Gregorian calendar, while the beginning date is based on the Julian calendar (or occasionally the proleptic Gregorian calendar).\nIn the late 1990s, there was a dispute as to whether the millennium should be taken to end on December 31, 1999, or December 31, 2000.\nStephen Jay Gould at the time argued there is no objective way of deciding this question. \nAssociated Press reported that the third millennium began on 1 January 2001, but also reported that celebrations in the US were generally more subdued at the beginning of 2001, compared to the beginning of 2000.\nMany public celebrations for the end of the second millennium were held on December 31, 1999 \u2013 January 1, 2000\u2014with a few people marking the end of the millennium a year later.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It encompasses the Iron Age in the Old World and sees the transition from the Ancient Near East to classical antiquity.\nWorld population roughly doubled over the course of the millennium, from about 100 million to about 200\u2013250 million after the birth of Jesus Christ and the establishment of the Julio-Claudian dynasty led by its founder Octavian.\nOverview.\nThe Neo-Assyrian Empire dominates the Near East in the early centuries of the millennium, supplanted by the Achaemenid Empire in the 6th century. Ancient Egypt is in decline, and falls to the Achaemenids in 525 BC.\nIn Greece, Classical Antiquity begins with the colonization of Magna Graecia and peaks with the conquest of the Achaemenids and the subsequent flourishing of Hellenistic civilization (4th to 2nd centuries).\nThe Roman Republic supplants the Etruscans and then the Carthaginians (5th to 3rd centuries). The close of the millennium sees the rise of the Roman Empire. The early Celtic culture dominate Central Europe while Northern Europe is in the Pre-Roman Iron Age. In East Africa, the Nubian Empire and Aksum arise.\nIn South Asia, the Vedic civilization gives rise to the Maurya Empire. The Scythians dominate Central Asia. In China, the Zhou dynasty rules the Chinese heartland at the beginning of the millennium. The decline of the Zhou dynasty during Spring and Autumn period and the Warring States period sees the rise of such philosophical and spiritual traditions as Confucianism and Taoism. Towards the close of the millennium, the Han dynasty extends Chinese power towards Central Asia, where it borders on Indo-Greek and Iranian states. Japan is in the Yayoi period. \nThe Olmec civilization declines, and the Maya and Zapotec civilizations emerge in Mesoamerica. The Chav\u00edn culture flourishes in Peru.\nThe first millennium BC is the formative period of the classical world religions, with the development of early Judaism and Zoroastrianism in the Near East, and Vedic religion and Vedanta, Jainism and Buddhism in India. Early literature develops in Greek, Latin, Hebrew, Sanskrit, Tamil and Chinese. The term Axial Age, coined by Karl Jaspers, is intended to express the crucial importance of the period of c. the 8th to 2nd centuries BC in world history.\nWorld population more than doubled over the course of the millennium, from about an estimated 50\u2013100 million to an estimated 170\u2013300 million.\nClose to 90% of world population at the end of the first millennium BC lived in the Iron Age civilizations of the Old World (Roman Empire, Parthian Empire, Graeco-Indo-Scythian and Hindu kingdoms, Han China). \nThe population of the Americas was below 20 million, concentrated in Mesoamerica (Epi-Olmec culture);\nthat of Sub-Saharan Africa was likely below 10 million.

The alphabet develops. \nAt the center of the millennium, a new order emerges with Mycenaean Greek dominance of the Aegean and the rise of the Hittite Empire. The end of the millennium sees the Bronze Age collapse and the transition to the Iron Age.\nOther regions of the world are still in the prehistoric period. In Europe, the Beaker culture introduces the Bronze Age, presumably associated with Indo-European expansion. The Indo-Iranian expansion reaches the Iranian plateau and onto the Indian subcontinent (Vedic India), propagating the use of the chariot. Mesoamerica enters the Pre-Classic (Olmec) period. North America is in the late Archaic stage. In Maritime Southeast Asia, the Austronesian expansion reaches Micronesia. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the Bantu expansion begins.\nWorld population rose steadily, possibly surpassing the 100 million mark for the first time.\nHistory.\nSee the article on chronology of the ancient Near East for a discussion regarding the accuracy and resolution of dates for events of the 2nd millennium BC in the Near East.\nMiddle Bronze Age.\nSpending much of their energies in trying to recuperate from the chaotic situation that existed at the turn of the millennium, the most powerful civilizations of the time, Egypt and Mesopotamia, turned their attention to more modest goals. The Pharaohs of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt and their contemporary Kings of Babylon, of Amorite origin, brought governance that was largely popular and approved of among their subjects, and favoured elegant art and architecture. Farther east, the Indus Valley civilization was in a period of decline, possibly as a result of intense, ruinous flooding.\nEgypt and Babylonia's military tactics were still based on foot soldiers transporting their equipment on donkeys. Combined with a weak economy and difficulty in maintaining order, this was a fragile situation that crumbled under the pressure of external forces they could not oppose.\nUnrest of the 16th century.\nAbout a century before the middle of the millennium, bands of Indo-European invaders came from the Central Asian plains and swept through Western Asia and Northeast Africa. They were riding fast two-wheeled chariots powered by horses, a system of weaponry developed earlier in the context of plains warfare. This tool of war was unknown among the classical civilizations. Egypt and Babylonia's foot soldiers were unable to defend against the invaders: in 1630 BC, the Hyksos swept into the Nile Delta, and in 1595 BC, the Hittites swept into Mesopotamia.\nLate Bronze Age.\nThe people in place were quick to adapt to the new tactics, and a new international situation resulted from the change. Though during most of the second half of the 2nd millennium BC several regional powers competed relentlessly for hegemony, many developments occurred: there was new emphasis on grandiose architecture, new clothing fashions, vivid diplomatic correspondence on clay tablets, renewed economic exchanges, and the New Kingdom of Egypt played the role of the main superpower. Among the great states of the time, only Babylon refrained from taking part in battles, mainly due to its new position as the world's religious and intellectual capital.\nThe Bronze Age civilization at its final period of time, displayed all its characteristic social traits: low level of urbanization, small cities centered on temples or royal palaces, strict separation of classes between an illiterate mass of peasants and craftsmen, and a powerful military elite, knowledge of writing and education reserved to a tiny minority of scribes, and pronounced aristocratic life.\nNear the end of the 2nd millennium BC, new waves of barbarians, this time riding on horseback, wholly destroyed the Bronze Age world, and were to be followed by waves of social changes that marked the beginning of different times. Also contributing to the changes were the Sea Peoples, ship-faring raiders of the Mediterranean.\nPrehistoric cultures.\nEurope is still entirely within the prehistoric era; much of Europe enters the Bronze Age early in the 2nd millennium.\nThe desiccation of the Sahara is complete. Neolithisation of Sub-Saharan Africa is initiated via expansion from the dried Sahara, reaching West and East Africa. Later in the 2nd millennium, pastoralism and iron metallurgy spread to Central Africa via the Bantu migration. \nLanguages.\nIn the history of the Egyptian language, the early 2nd millennium saw a transition from Old Egyptian to Middle Egyptian. As the most used written form of the Ancient Egyptian language, it is frequently (incorrectly) referred to simply as \"Hieroglyphics\".\nThe earliest attested Indo-European language, the Hittite language, first appears in cuneiform in the 16th century BC (Anitta text), before disappearing from records in the 13th century BC. Hittite is the best known and the most studied language of the extinct Anatolian branch of Indo-European languages.\nThe first Northwest Semitic language, Ugaritic, is attested in the 14th century BC. The first fully phonemic script Proto-Canaanite developed from Egyptian hieroglyphs, becoming the Phoenician alphabet by 1200 BC. The Phoenician alphabet was spread throughout the Mediterranean by Phoenician maritime traders and became one of the most widely used writing systems in the world, and the parent of virtually all alphabetic writing systems. The Phoenician language is also the first Canaanite language, the Northwest Semitic languages spoken by the ancient peoples of the Canaan region: the Israelites, Phoenicians, Amorites, Ammonites, Moabites and Edomites.\nMycenaean Greek, the most ancient attested form of the Greek language, was used on the Greek mainland, Crete and Cyprus in the Mycenaean period.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This period of time corresponds to the Early to Middle Bronze Age, characterized by the early empires in the Ancient Near East. In Ancient Egypt, the Early Dynastic Period is followed by the Old Kingdom. In Mesopotamia, the Early Dynastic Period is followed by the Akkadian Empire. In what is now Northwest India and Pakistan, the Indus Valley Civilization developed a state society.\nWorld population growth relaxed after the burst due to the Neolithic Revolution.\nWorld population was largely stable, at roughly 60 million, with a slow overall growth rate at roughly 0.03% p.a.\nOverview.\nThe Bronze Age began in the Ancient Near East roughly between 3000 BC and 2500 BC. The previous millennium had seen the emergence of advanced, urbanized civilizations, new bronze metallurgy extending the productivity of agricultural work, and highly developed ways of communication in the form of writing. In the 3rd millennium BC, the growth of these riches, both intellectually and physically, became a source of contention on a political stage, and rulers sought the accumulation of more wealth and more power. Along with this came the first appearances of monumental architecture, imperialism, organized absolutism and internal revolution.\nThe civilizations of Sumer and Akkad in Mesopotamia became a collection of volatile city-states in which warfare was common. Uninterrupted conflicts drained all available resources, energies and populations. In this millennium, larger empires succeeded the last, and conquerors grew in stature until the great Sargon of Akkad pushed his empire to the whole of Mesopotamia and beyond. It would not be surpassed in size until Assyrian times 1,500 years later.\nIn the Old Kingdom of Egypt, the Egyptian pyramids were constructed and would remain the tallest and largest human constructions for thousands of years. Also in Egypt, pharaohs began to posture themselves as living gods made of an essence different from that of other human beings. In Europe, which was still largely Neolithic during the same period, the builders of megaliths were constructing giant monuments of their own. In the Near East and the Occident during the 3rd millennium BC, limits were being pushed by architects and rulers.\nTowards the close of the millennium, Egypt became the stage of the first popular revolution recorded in history. After lengthy wars, the Sumerians recognized the benefits of unification into a stable form of national government and became a relatively peaceful, well-organized, complex technocratic state called the 3rd Dynasty of Ur. This dynasty was later to become involved with a wave of nomadic invaders known as the Amorites, who were to play a major role in the region during the following centuries.\nEvents.\nCertain 4th millennium BC events were precursors to the 3rd millennium BC:\nThe 3rd millennium BC included the following key events:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Agriculture spread widely across Eurasia.\nWorld population growth relaxed after the burst that came about from the Neolithic Revolution. World population was largely stable in this time at roughly 50 million, growing at an average of 0.027% per year.\nCulture.\nSub-Saharan Africa remains in the Paleolithic period, except for the earliest neolithization of the Sahel following the desiccation of the Sahara in c. 3500 BC. As the grasslands of the Sahara began drying after 3900 BC, herders spread into the Nile Valley and into eastern Africa (Eburan 5, Elmenteitan). The desiccation of the Sahara and the associated neolithisation of West Africa is also cited as a possible cause for the dispersal of the Niger-Congo linguistic phylum.\nEnvironment.\nBased on studies by glaciologist Lonnie Thompson, professor at Ohio State University and researcher with the Byrd Polar Research Center, a number of indicators shows there was a global change in climate 5,200 years ago, probably due to a drop in solar energy output."}

It is impossible to precisely date events that happened around the time of this millennium and all dates mentioned here are estimates mostly based on geological and anthropological analysis.\nCommunities.\nThe rapid world population growth of the previous millennium, caused by the Neolithic Revolution, is believed to have slowed and become fairly stable. It has been estimated that there were around forty million people worldwide by 5000 BC, growing to 100 million by the Middle Bronze Age c.\u20091600 BC.\nEurope.\nThe Stentinello culture stretches from Sicily and Calabria to the Aeolian Islands representing cultural focus on seafaring and maritime trade at this time. Sardinia has close trade relations with the Mediterranean Neolithic communities of southern France, the Iberian Peninsula, the Italian peninsula and Sicily and is a major participant of the silver trade.\nWest Asia.\nMesopotamia.\nIts chronology within the 5th millennium consists of:\nOverall, the Ubaid period experiences sporadic but controlled growth of socially stratified settlements, with communal areas, segregation of classes per quarters and complex social stratification. Increased conflict between democratic councils, large scale chiefdoms, royalties, polities and imperial-like aspirations. Large scale stone masonry for public use, and organised seal estampage of international importance are associated characteristics of the era. P. Amiet sees as a 'proto-royal figure,' i.e., potentially Enki, preceding the 'priest-kings' of the 4th millennium.\nOf the hundreds of polities and tens of important city states here are a few notable events:\nUlterior Middle East.\nIn modern Turkey: Strong Anatolian polities counteract the balance of power from the Ubaid polities and dwaining Samarrans who were culturally assimilated around 4800 BC. Such polities include Mersin notably having a standing army circa 4300 BC, and Hamoukar, which was a major production centre in the important Obsidian trade and thus power. \nAn intensive copper trade, connecting Europe with the East, is represented in Anatolia by sites at Hacilar, Beycesultan, Canhasan, Mersin Yumuktepe, Elazig Tepecik, Malatya Degirmentepe, Nor\u015funtepe, and Istanbul Fikirtepe.\nPrior environmental devastation in the previous two millennia may account for the lack of Neolithic sites in northern Turkey.\nIn the Levant: Ghassulian culture thrives, immigrating from the North into the whole of the Levant circa 4400 BC. With concentrated settlements and elites economically focused on copper metallurgy and trade, notably importing from Southern Jordan's vast and powerful urban polities and Bedouin-like cultures. The Ghassulian culture trades and correlates closely with the Amratians of Egypt and also seems to have affinities (e.g., the distinctive churns, or \"bird vases\") with early Minoan culture in Crete.[3][6]\nCypriot affinities are not seen, with Cyprus experiencing newcomers circa 4500 BC who arrived and introduced a new Neolithic era. This Sotira culture replaced the void of the collapse of the 6th millennium Neolithic culture in Cyprus.\nTrade with Levant and external regions on an impressive scale and covering large distances starts to connect Europe with Asia on a more direct scale than before. Obsidian found in the Chalcolithic levels at Gilat, Israel have had their origins traced via elemental analysis to three sources in Southern Anatolia: Hotamis Da\u011f, G\u00f6ll\u00fc Da\u011f, and as far east as Nemrut Da\u011f, 500\u00a0km (310\u00a0mi) east of the other two sources. This is indicative of a very large trade circle reaching as far as the Northern Fertile Crescent and Anatolia.\nIn the Caucasus: Settlements of the 5th millennium BC in North Caucasus attest to a material culture that was related to contemporaneous archaeological complexes in the northern and western Black Sea region like the Leyla-Tepe culture (c. 4300 \u2013 4000BC). These polities were immense economically, and pioneered copper metallurgy and trade. Constant immigration from Ubadians and from Uruk herself did play economic factors as well.\nSuch cultural elements change and are replaced, suddenly during the latter first half of the 4th Millennium BC, and the quality of copper metallurgy declines somewhat, during the Kura\u2013Araxes culture.\nOn the other hand, the millennia long attested Shulaveri\u2013Shomu culture showed stronger cultural connections like similar tool kits and use of red ochre, portrays intimate and centuries-old ties with the Halafians.\nIn Arabia: Continuation of Ubaid economical expansion and culture(since the 6th millennium BC, circa 5500 BC) throughout Arabia, with adoption and integration but also contributions to these new political features. Ubaid pottery of periods 2 and 3 has been documented at site H3 in Kuwait and in Dosariyah in eastern Saudi Arabia, which bordered the Persian Gulf, a major trade hub.\nCentral Asia (North and South).\nCentral:\nA millennia after the Iranian farmer cultures had first cemented with ancestry from the Caucasus and Iranian plateau hunter-gatherers and middle east, (circa 6000 BC) in Pakistan and north-west India and migrations from southwest Asia had resulted in increasing urbanisation and increasing social stratification. Such cultures include:\nModern Dravidian (Geographically in India) peoples (not to be confused with the language) whose history predates the onset of the Bronze Age in the Indian subcontinent (around 3300 BC) inhabited the area before the arrival of other ethnic groups like the Tibeto-Burmans and Indo-Aryans from across the border.\nNorth:\nSignificant linguistic connections are made with the precursor to the Proto-Indo European languages (circa 4500 BC), via the Eurasiatic language and parts of the Dravidian language to a prior language family during the Upper Palaeolithic. Dravidian having multiple cultural origins and development over millennia can be considered just as influential on an international scale as the Indo European languages from the 5th millennium BC to the 1st millennium AD. Such influence has been explored, such examples are the Elamo-Dravidian languages, a family that would have pioneered Susa, Central Mesopotamia, trade and politics within the Ubaid era.\nSouth: \nThese Southern migrations into India contributed to parts of the Proto-Dravidian language, having multiple variants i.e., Proto-South Dravidian language based on geographical location, however the language itself is known to have largely been native to central India as well. This melting pot of cultures peaked from the 5th millennium BC into the 4th millennium BC.\nIndian Y-lineages are close to southern European populations and the time of divergence between the two predated Steppe migration:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;These results suggest that the European-related ancestry in Indian populations might be much older and more complex than anticipated, and might originate from the first wave of agriculturists millennia before the 5th Millennium BC.\u2014\u200a\nEast Asia.\nChina.\nChinese civilisation advanced in this millennium with the beginnings of three noted cultures from around 5000 BC. The Yangshao culture was based in the Huang He (Yellow River) basin and endured for some 2,000 years. It is believed that pigs were first domesticated there. Pottery was fired in kilns dug into the ground and then painted. Millet was cultivated. A type-site settlement for the Yangshao was established c.\u20094700 BC at Banpo near modern Xi'an, Shaanxi.\nAlso about 5000 BC, the Hemudu culture began in eastern China with cultivation of rice, and the Majiabang culture was established on the Yangtze estuary near modern Shanghai, lasting until c.\u20093300 BC.\nOceania.\nAustralia.\nIt is estimated that the distinctive Aboriginal rock carvings near Sydney were created sometime between 5000 BC and 3000 BC.\nSea levels had become relatively stabilized by the time of 4500 BC around the coastlines of Australia. This occurred after several thousands of years of sea level rising, due to glaciers melting after the Younger Dryas event. This knowledge was passed down in oral history among the Aboriginal tribes of Australia as they recalled the drastic sea level rises that ended up swallowing their once lower coastlines.\nAround the time of the 5th Millennium BC, there was a proliferation of stone tool, plant processing and landscape modification technologies. Elaborate fish and eel traps involving channels up to three kilometres long were in use in western Victoria from about 6,500 years ago. Semi-permanent collections of wooden huts on mounds also appeared in western Victoria, associated with a more systematic exploitation of new food sources in the wetlands.\nThe Furneaux Group, which is a set of islands off the Northeast portion of Tasmania, had been inhabited since at least 33,000 BC, but the Aboriginal Tasmanians stopped living there permanently around the time of 4,000 BC.\nRock art in the Northern Territory of Australia, specifically from the area of Arnhem Land is said to have a portion of its depictions dating to around 4,000 BC, which show battle scenes or skirmishes between the people in the local area. The art also includes animals and other ceremonial meanings. These scenes have been dated to up to 10,000 years old and down to 6,000 years old when painted continuously over time.\nStone points for spears and distinct stone point technology have been found dating from 5\u20137 thousand years ago in Australia. Many of the early stone point technologies are specifically found in the Kimberley Region of the northern portion of West Australia. Spear throwers or more specifically developed and used by Australian Aboriginals, 'Woomeras' are believed to have become in widespread use around this time around Australia.\nAfrica.\nNorth to latitude 15\u00b0 North of the Equator:\nMore complex structures followed during a second intensive wave onwards from 4500 BC. With alignments with Sirius, Arcturus, Alpha Centauri, and the Belt of Orion. This suggests a great academic pursuit to investigate astronomical observations, cosmology and mathematics. Fifth millennium alignments of stele to bright stars focussed on issues of major practical importance of the era being: cattle, water, death, earth, sun, stars and theology.\nSub-Saharan Africa:\nThe Caribbean.\nShell mounds in these areas are highly visible, which likely aided in their identification by scholars. Examples like Cerro de las Conchas, which dates between 5500 and 3500BC appearing to have been a sea resource collection and processing site. While it seems Cerro de las Conchas was only occupied seasonally, it seems likely that inland base camps were occupied year-round.\nSouth America.\nLauricocha III: 4200 \u2013 2500 BC (Andean preceramic V) begins. Chiefdoms and fish gatherer-hunter societies dominate. Lauricocha was one of the important mountain encampments at the time.\nCalendars and chronology.\nThe 5th millennium has become a start point for calendars and chronologies. The year 4750 BC is the retrospective startpoint for the Assyrian calendar, marking the traditional date for the foundation of Assur, some 2,000 years before it actually happened.\nAnother traditional date is 19 July 4241 BC, marking the supposed beginning of the Egyptian calendar, as calculated retrospectively by Eduard Meyer. The more likely startpoint is 19 July 2781 BC, one Sothic cycle later. It has generally been believed that the calendar was based on a heliacal (dawn) rising of Sirius but that view is now being questioned.\nAccording to the Ussher chronology, the creation of Earth happened on 22/23 October 4004 BC. This chronology was the work of James Ussher, whose basis was the dates in the Old Testament of the Bible. He estimated that the universe was created by God at either 18:00 on the 22nd (Jewish calendar) or 09:00 on the 23rd (Ussher-Lightfoot-Chronology).\nYet another calendar starting date in the 5th millennium is Monday, 1 January 4713 BC, the beginning of the current Julian Period, first described by Joseph Justus Scaliger in the sixteenth century. This Julian Period lasts 7,980 years until the year 3268 (current era) in the next millennium. It is a useful device for date conversions between different calendars. The date of origin has the integer value of zero in the Julian Day Count: i.e., in the Julian Calendar; the equivalent date in the Gregorian Calendar is 24 November 4714\u00a0BC.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

All conflicts in 2009 were intrastate conflicts that involved violent non-state actors.\nSeveral new conflicts began against rebel groups in 2009. The CPJP reignited conflict in the Central African Bush War, a faction of the NDFB broke a 2004 ceasefire with India in the Bodoland region, and a conflict broke out between Myanmar and the MNDAA when the government forced the MNDAA out of the Kokang. Boko Haram launched an insurgency in Nigeria, which was paused when its leader Mohammed Yusuf was killed.\nRwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) resumed conflict against the FDLR when they launched Operation Umoja Wetu in January. The DRC and a United Nations mission launched Operation Kimia II against the FDLR in March after the group regained its strength. Conflict also resumed in Angola against the For\u00e7as Armadas de Cabinda, and al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula formed in Yemen to expand al-Qaeda's insurgency in the country.\nThe Ihussi Accord ended conflict between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the CNDP within the broader Kivu conflict. This was the only peace agreement reached in 2009. Eelam War IV, the final stage in the Sri Lankan civil war, ended in May when the Sri Lankan government defeated the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. It remained the deadliest conflict of the year.\nCulture.\nThe highest-grossing film globally in 2009 was \"Avatar\", followed by \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\" and \"\".

Afghanistan was the largest source of refugees with approximately 1.9\u00a0million people.\nConflicts.\nThere were 32 conflicts in 2005 that caused at least 25 fatalities, all of which were intrastate wars involving violent non-state actors. Five of these resulted in over 1,000 fatalities: the Iraqi insurgency, the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan, the Kashmir insurgency, the Nepalese Civil War, and the Colombian conflict. Among continuing conflicts from previous years, the Iraqi insurgency meant further violence in Iraq throughout 2005, including a major suicide bombing on February 28 and a series of attacks as the Iraqi Transitional Government was established in April and May. The Second Chechen War in Russia saw the assassination of Chechen rebel leader Aslan Maskhadov by Russian forces on March 8, and the Kivu conflict and Ituri conflict continued in the Democratic Republic of the Congo despite the formal end of the Second Congo War in 2002.\nThe government of Myanmar broke its 2003 ceasefire with the Karen National Union in January, and it engaged in heightened conflict with the Shan State Army (RCSS) in April. The frozen conflict between Azerbaijan and the breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh also reignited as a 1994 ceasefire collapsed. In Sri Lanka, peace talks broke down with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. Peace talks took place to end the Second Intifada between Israel and Palestine, which were complicated by attacks from Palestinian militant groups and subsequent Israeli retaliation. Hezbollah also engaged in conflict with Israel, causing violence in Golan Heights and on the Israel\u2013Lebanon border. New rebel groups that emerged in 2005 included the Rally for Democracy and Liberty in Chad, the National Socialist Council of Nagaland in India, the Kurdistan Free Life Party in Iran, and the Maoist Communist Party in Turkey.\nThe Comprehensive Peace Agreement between Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement was signed on January 9, ending the Second Sudanese Civil War.
