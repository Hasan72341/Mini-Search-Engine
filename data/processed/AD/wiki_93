Endianness is primarily expressed as big-endian (BE) or little-endian (LE).\nComputers store information in various-sized groups of binary bits. Each group is assigned a number, called its \"address\", that the computer uses to access that data. On most modern computers, the smallest data group with an address is eight bits long and is called a byte. Larger groups comprise two or more bytes, for example, a 32-bit word contains four bytes.\nThere are two principal ways a computer could number the individual bytes in a larger group, starting at either end. A big-endian system stores the most significant byte of a word at the smallest memory address and the least significant byte at the largest. A little-endian system, in contrast, stores the least-significant byte at the smallest address. Of the two, big-endian is thus closer to the way the digits of numbers are written left-to-right in English, comparing digits to bytes and assuming addresses increase from left to right.\nBoth types of endianness are in widespread use in digital electronic engineering. The initial choice of endianness of a new design is often arbitrary, but later technology revisions and updates perpetuate the existing endianness to maintain backward compatibility. Big-endianness is the dominant ordering in networking protocols, such as in the Internet protocol suite, where it is referred to as \"network order\", transmitting the most significant byte first. Conversely, little-endianness is the dominant ordering for processor architectures (x86, most ARM implementations, base RISC-V implementations) and their associated memory. File formats can use either ordering; some formats use a mixture of both or contain an indicator of which ordering is used throughout the file.\n\"Bi-endianness\" is a feature supported by numerous computer architectures that feature switchable endianness in data fetches and stores or for instruction fetches. Other orderings are generically called \"middle-endian\" or \"mixed-endian\".\nOrigin.\nEndianness is primarily expressed as \"big-endian\" (BE) or \"little-endian\" (LE), terms introduced by Danny Cohen in an Internet Experiment Note published in 1980. Cohen borrowed the terms from an absurd episode in the satirical novel \"Gulliver's Travels\" by Jonathan Swift. In the imaginary land of Lilliput, scholars are fiercely divided by a never-ending debate over how to correctly break the shell of a boiled egg. Those who insist on breaking the big end of the shell are Big-Endians, while their opponents who break the opposite end of the shell are Little-Endians.\nCharacteristics.\nComputer memory consists of a sequence of storage cells (smallest addressable units); in machines that support byte addressing, those units are called \"bytes\". Each byte is identified and accessed in hardware and software by its memory address. If the total number of bytes in memory is \"n\", then addresses are enumerated from 0 to \"n\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a01.\nComputer programs often use data structures or fields that may consist of more data than can be stored in one byte. In the context of this article, where its type cannot be arbitrarily complicated, a \"field\" consists of a consecutive sequence of bytes and represents a \"simple data value\" which, at least potentially, can be manipulated by \"one\" single hardware instruction. On most systems, the address of a multi-byte simple data value is the address of its first byte (the byte with the lowest address). There are exceptions to this rule \u2013 for example, the Add instruction of the IBM 1401 addresses variable-length fields at their low-order (highest-addressed) position with their lengths being defined by a word mark set at their high-order (lowest-addressed) position. When an operation such as addition is performed, the processor begins at the low-order positions at the high addresses of the two fields and works its way down to the high-order.\nAnother important attribute of a byte being part of a \"field\" is its \"significance\".\nThese attributes of the parts of a field play an important role in the sequence the bytes are accessed by the computer hardware, more precisely: by the low-level algorithms contributing to the results of a computer instruction.\nNumbers.\nPositional number systems (mostly base 2, or less often base 10) are the predominant way of representing and particularly of manipulating integer data by computers. In pure form, this is valid for moderately sized non-negative integers, e.g. of C data type codice_1. In such a number system, the \"value\" of a digit that contributes to the whole number is determined not only by its value as a single digit, but also by the position it holds in the complete number, called its significance. These positions can be mapped to memory mainly in two ways:\nIn \"big-endian\" and \"little-endian\", the \"end\" is the extremity where the \"big\" or \"little\" significance is written in the location indexed by the lowest memory address.\nText.\nWhen character (text) strings are to be compared with one another, e.g., in order to support some mechanism like sorting, this is very frequently done lexicographically where a single positional element (character) also has a positional value. Lexicographical comparison means almost everywhere: first character ranks highest, as in the telephone book. Almost all machines that can do this using a single instruction are big-endian or at least mixed-endian.\nInteger numbers written as text are always represented most significant digit first in memory, which is similar to big-endian, independently of text direction.\nByte addressing.\nWhen memory bytes are printed sequentially from left to right (e.g., in a hex dump), little-endian representation of integers has the significance increasing from right to left. In other words, it appears backwards when visualized, which can be counterintuitive.\nThis behavior arises, for example, in FourCC or similar techniques that involve packing characters into an integer, so that it becomes a sequence of specific characters in memory. For example, take the string \"JOHN\", stored in hexadecimal ASCII. On big-endian machines, the value appears left-to-right, coinciding with the correct string order for reading the result (\"J O H N\"). But on a little-endian machine, one would see \"N H O J\". Middle-endian machines complicate this even further; for example, on the PDP-11, the 32-bit value is stored as two 16-bit words \"JO\" \"HN\" in big-endian, with the characters in the 16-bit words being stored in little-endian, resulting in \"O J N H\".\nByte swapping.\nByte-swapping consists of rearranging bytes to change endianness. Many compilers provide built-ins that are likely to be compiled into native processor instructions (/), such as . Software interfaces for swapping include:\nSome CPU instruction sets provide native support for endian byte swapping, such as (x86 \u2014 486 and later, i960 \u2014 i960Jx and later), and (ARMv6 and later).\nSome compilers have built-in facilities for byte swapping. For example, the Intel Fortran compiler supports the non-standard specifier when opening a file, e.g.: . Other compilers have options for generating code that globally enables the conversion for all file IO operations. This permits the reuse of code on a system with the opposite endianness without code modification.\nConsiderations.\nSimplified access to part of a field.\nOn most systems, the address of a multi-byte value is the address of its first byte (the byte with the lowest address); little-endian systems of that type have the property that, for sufficiently low data values, the same value can be read from memory at different lengths without using different addresses (even when alignment restrictions are imposed). For example, a 32-bit memory location with content can be read at the same address as either 8-bit (value = 4A), 16-bit (004A), 24-bit (00004A), or 32-bit (0000004A), all of which retain the same numeric value. Although this little-endian property is rarely used directly by high-level programmers, it is occasionally employed by code optimizers as well as by assembly language programmers. While not allowed by C++, such type punning code is allowed as \"implementation-defined\" by the C11 standard and commonly used in code interacting with hardware.\nCalculation order.\nSome operations in positional number systems have a natural or preferred order in which the elementary steps are to be executed. This order may affect their performance on small-scale byte-addressable processors and microcontrollers. However, high-performance processors usually fetch multi-byte operands from memory in the same amount of time they would have fetched a single byte, so the complexity of the hardware is not affected by the byte ordering.\nAddition, subtraction, and multiplication start at the least significant digit position and propagate the carry to the subsequent more significant position. On most systems, the address of a multi-byte value is the address of its first byte (the byte with the lowest address). The implementation of these operations is marginally simpler using little-endian machines, where this first byte contains the least significant digit.\nComparison and division start at the most significant digit and propagate a possible carry to the subsequent less significant digits. For fixed-length numerical values (typically of length 1,2,4,8,16), the implementation of these operations is marginally simpler on big-endian machines.\nSome big-endian processors (e.g. the IBM System/360 and its successors) contain hardware instructions for lexicographically comparing varying-length character strings.\nThe normal data transport by an assignment statement is, in principle, independent of the endianness of the processor.\nHardware.\nMany historical and extant processors use a big-endian memory representation, either exclusively or as a design option. The IBM System/360 uses big-endian byte order, as do its successors System/370, ESA/390, and z/Architecture. The PDP-10 uses big-endian addressing for byte-oriented instructions. The IBM Series/1 minicomputer uses big-endian byte order. The Motorola 6800 / 6801, the 6809 and the 68000 series of processors use the big-endian format. Solely big-endian architectures include the IBM z/Architecture and OpenRISC. The PDP-11 minicomputer, however, uses little-endian byte order, as does its VAX successor.\nThe Datapoint 2200 used simple bit-serial logic with little-endian to facilitate carry propagation. When Intel developed the 8008 microprocessor for Datapoint, they used little-endian for compatibility. However, as Intel was unable to deliver the 8008 in time, Datapoint used a medium-scale integration equivalent, but the little-endianness was retained in most Intel designs, including the MCS-48 and the 8086 and its x86 successors, including IA-32 and x86-64 processors. The MOS Technology 6502 family (including Western Design Center 65802 and 65C816), the Zilog Z80 (including Z180 and eZ80), the Altera Nios II, the Atmel AVR, the Andes Technology NDS32, the Qualcomm Hexagon, and many other processors and processor families are also little-endian.\nThe Intel 8051, unlike other Intel processors, expects 16-bit addresses for LJMP and LCALL in big-endian format; however, xCALL instructions store the return address onto the stack in little-endian format.\nBi-endianness.\nSome instruction set architectures feature a setting which allows for switchable endianness in data fetches and stores, instruction fetches, or both; those instruction set architectures are referred to as \"bi-endian\". Architectures that support switchable endianness include PowerPC/Power ISA, SPARC V9, ARM versions 3 and above, DEC Alpha, MIPS, Intel i860, PA-RISC, SuperH SH-4, IA-64, C-Sky, and RISC-V. This feature can improve performance or simplify the logic of networking devices and software. The word \"bi-endian\", when said of hardware, denotes the capability of the machine to compute or pass data in either endian format.\nMany of these architectures can be switched via software to default to a specific endian format (usually done when the computer starts up); however, on some systems, the default endianness is selected by hardware on the motherboard and cannot be changed via software (e.g., Alpha, which runs only in big-endian mode on the Cray T3E).\nIBM AIX and IBM i run in big-endian mode on bi-endian Power ISA; Linux originally ran in big-endian mode, but by 2019, IBM had transitioned to little-endian mode for Linux to ease the porting of Linux software from x86 to Power. SPARC has no relevant little-endian deployment, as both Oracle Solaris and Linux run in big-endian mode on bi-endian SPARC systems, and can be considered big-endian in practice. ARM, C-Sky, and RISC-V have no relevant big-endian deployments, and can be considered little-endian in practice.\nThe term \"bi-endian\" refers primarily to how a processor treats data accesses. Instruction accesses (fetches of instruction words) on a given processor may still assume a fixed endianness, even if data accesses are fully bi-endian, though this is not always the case, such as on Intel's IA-64-based Itanium CPU, which allows both.\nSome nominally bi-endian CPUs require motherboard help to fully switch endianness. For instance, the 32-bit desktop-oriented PowerPC processors in little-endian mode act as little-endian from the point of view of the executing programs, but they require the motherboard to perform a 64-bit swap across all 8 byte lanes to ensure that the little-endian view of things will apply to I/O devices. In the absence of this unusual motherboard hardware, device driver software must write to different addresses to undo the incomplete transformation and also must perform a normal byte swap.\nSome CPUs, such as many PowerPC processors intended for embedded use and almost all SPARC processors, allow per-page choice of endianness.\nSPARC processors since the late 1990s (SPARC v9 compliant processors) allow data endianness to be chosen with each individual instruction that loads from or stores to memory.\nThe ARM architecture supports two big-endian modes, called \"BE-8\" and \"BE-32\". CPUs up to ARMv5 only support BE-32 or word-invariant mode. Here, any naturally aligned 32-bit access works like in little-endian mode, but access to a byte or 16-bit word is redirected to the corresponding address and unaligned access is not allowed. ARMv6 introduces BE-8 or byte-invariant mode, where access to a single byte works as in little-endian mode, but accessing a 16-bit, 32-bit or (starting with ARMv8) 64-bit word results in a byte swap of the data. This simplifies unaligned memory access as well as memory-mapped access to registers other than 32-bit.\nMany processors have instructions to convert a word in a register to the opposite endianness, that is, they swap the order of the bytes in a 16-, 32- or 64-bit word. \nRecent Intel x86 and x86-64 architecture CPUs have a MOVBE instruction (Intel Core since generation 4, after Atom), which fetches a big-endian format word from memory or writes a word into memory in big-endian format. These processors are otherwise thoroughly little-endian.\nThere are also devices that use different formats in different places. For instance, the BQ27421 Texas Instruments battery gauge uses the little-endian format for its registers and the big-endian format for its random-access memory.\nSPARC historically used big-endian until version 9, which is bi-endian. Similarly, early IBM POWER processors were big-endian, but the PowerPC and Power ISA descendants are now bi-endian. The ARM architecture was little-endian before version 3 when it became bi-endian.\nFloating point.\nAlthough many processors use little-endian storage for all types of data (integer, floating point), there are a number of hardware architectures where floating-point numbers are represented in big-endian form while integers are represented in little-endian form. There are ARM processors that have mixed-endian floating-point representation for double-precision numbers: each of the two 32-bit words is stored as little-endian, but the most significant word is stored first. VAX floating point stores little-endian 16-bit words in big-endian order. Because there have been many floating-point formats with no network standard representation for them, the XDR standard uses big-endian IEEE 754 as its representation. It may therefore appear strange that the widespread IEEE 754 floating-point standard does not specify endianness. Theoretically, this means that even standard IEEE floating-point data written by one machine might not be readable by another. However, on modern standard computers (i.e., implementing IEEE 754), one may safely assume that the endianness is the same for floating-point numbers as for integers, making the conversion straightforward regardless of data type. Small embedded systems using special floating-point formats may be another matter, however.\nVariable-length data.\nMost instructions considered so far contain the size (lengths) of their operands within the operation code. Frequently available operand lengths are 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 bytes. But there are also architectures where the length of an operand may be held in a separate field of the instruction or with the operand itself, e.g. by means of a word mark. Such an approach allows operand lengths up to 256 bytes or larger. The data types of such operands are character strings or BCD. Machines able to manipulate such data with one instruction (e.g. compare, add) include the IBM 1401, 1410, 1620, System/360, System/370, ESA/390, and z/Architecture, all of them of type big-endian.\nMiddle-endian.\nNumerous other orderings, generically called \"middle-endian\" or \"mixed-endian\", are possible.\nThe PDP-11 is primarily a 16-bit little-endian system. The instructions to convert between floating-point and integer values in the optional floating-point processor of the PDP-11/45, PDP-11/70, and in some later processors, stored 32-bit \"double precision integer long\" values with the 16-bit halves swapped from the expected little-endian order. The UNIX C compiler used the same format for 32-bit long integers. This ordering is known as \"PDP-endian\".\nUNIX was one of the first systems to allow the same code to be compiled for platforms with different internal representations. One of the first programs converted was supposed to print out , but on the Series/1 it printed instead.\nA way to interpret this endianness is that it stores a 32-bit integer as two little-endian 16-bit words, with a big-endian word ordering:\nSegment descriptors of IA-32 and compatible processors keep a 32-bit base address of the segment stored in little-endian order, but in four nonconsecutive bytes, at relative positions 2, 3, 4 and 7 of the descriptor start.\nSoftware.\nLogic design.\nHardware description languages (HDLs) used to express digital logic often support arbitrary endianness, with arbitrary granularity. For example, in SystemVerilog, a word can be defined as little-endian or big-endian.\nFiles and filesystems.\nThe recognition of endianness is important when reading a file or filesystem created on a computer with different endianness.\nFortran sequential unformatted files created with one endianness usually cannot be read on a system using the other endianness because Fortran usually implements a record (defined as the data written by a single Fortran statement) as data preceded and succeeded by count fields, which are integers equal to the number of bytes in the data. An attempt to read such a file using Fortran on a system of the other endianness results in a run-time error, because the count fields are incorrect.\nUnicode text can optionally start with a byte order mark (BOM) to signal the endianness of the file or stream. Its code point is U+FEFF. In UTF-32 for example, a big-endian file should start with ; a little-endian should start with .\nApplication binary data formats, such as MATLAB \".mat\" files, or the \".bil\" data format, used in topography, are usually endianness-independent. This is achieved by storing the data always in one fixed endianness or carrying with the data a switch to indicate the endianness. An example of the former is the binary XLS file format that is portable between Windows and Mac systems and always little-endian, requiring the Mac application to swap the bytes on load and save when running on a big-endian Motorola 68K or PowerPC processor.\nTIFF image files are an example of the second strategy, whose header instructs the application about the endianness of their internal binary integers. If a file starts with the signature it means that integers are represented as big-endian, while means little-endian. Those signatures need a single 16-bit word each, and they are palindromes, so they are endianness independent. stands for Intel and stands for Motorola. Intel CPUs are little-endian, while Motorola 680x0 CPUs are big-endian. This explicit signature allows a TIFF reader program to swap bytes if necessary when a given file was generated by a TIFF writer program running on a computer with a different endianness.\nAs a consequence of its original implementation on the Intel 8080 platform, the operating system-independent File Allocation Table (FAT) file system is defined with little-endian byte ordering, even on platforms using another endianness natively, necessitating byte-swap operations for maintaining the FAT on these platforms.\nZFS, which combines a filesystem and a logical volume manager, is known to provide adaptive endianness and to work with both big-endian and little-endian systems.\nNetworking.\nMany IETF RFCs use the term \"network order\", meaning the order of transmission for bytes \"over the wire\" in network protocols. Among others, the historic defines the network order for protocols in the Internet protocol suite to be big-endian.\nHowever, not all protocols use big-endian byte order as the network order. The Server Message Block (SMB) protocol uses little-endian byte order. In CANopen, multi-byte parameters are always sent least significant byte first (little-endian). The same is true for Ethernet Powerlink.\nThe Berkeley sockets API defines a set of functions to convert 16- and 32-bit integers to and from network byte order: the (host-to-network-short) and (host-to-network-long) functions convert 16- and 32-bit values respectively from machine (\"host\") to network order; the and functions convert from network to host order. These functions may be a no-op on a big-endian system.\nWhile the high-level network protocols usually consider the byte (mostly meant as \"octet\") as their atomic unit, the lowest layers of a network stack may deal with ordering of bits within a byte. Bit ordering is sometimes referred to as little-endian or big-endian, but this not standard. Bit ordering does not need to be the same as byte ordering. For example, RS-232 transmits bits least significant first, I2C transmits bits most significant first, and SPI can be sent in either order. Ethernet transmits individual bits least significant first, but bytes are sent big-endian.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is based on the concentration of capsaicinoids, among which capsaicin is the predominant component.\nThe scale is named after its creator, American pharmacist Wilbur Scoville, whose 1912 method is known as the Scoville organoleptic test. The Scoville organoleptic test is a subjective assessment derived from the capsaicinoid sensitivity by people experienced with eating hot chilis.\nAn alternative method, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), can be used to analytically quantify the capsaicinoid content as an indicator of pungency.\nScoville organoleptic test.\nIn the Scoville organoleptic test, an exact weight of dried pepper is dissolved in alcohol to extract the heat components (capsaicinoids), then diluted in a solution of sugar water. Decreasing concentrations of the extracted capsaicinoids are given to a panel of five trained tasters, until a majority (at least three) can no longer detect the heat in a dilution. The heat level is based on this dilution, rated in multiples of 100 SHU.\nAnother source using subjective assessment stated, \"Conventional methods used in determining the level of pungency or capsaicin concentration are using a panel of tasters (Scoville organoleptic test method).\u00a0... Pepper pungency is measured in Scoville heat units (SHU). This measurement is the highest dilution of a chili pepper extract at which heat can be detected by a taste panel.\"\nA weakness of the Scoville organoleptic test is its imprecision due to human subjectivity, depending on the taster's palate and number of mouth heat receptors, which vary widely among subjects. Another shortcoming is sensory fatigue; the palate is quickly desensitized to capsaicinoids after tasting a few samples within a short time period. Results vary widely (up to \u00b1 50%) between laboratories.\nQuantification by HPLC.\nSince the 1980s, spice heat has been assessed quantitatively by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), which measures the concentration of heat-producing capsaicinoids, typically with capsaicin content as the main measure. As stated in one review \"the most reliable, rapid, and efficient method to identify and quantify capsaicinoids is HPLC; the results of which can be converted to Scoville heat units by multiplying the parts-per-million by 16.\"\nHPLC method gives results in American Spice Trade Association 1985 \"pungency units\", which are defined as one part capsaicin equivalent per million parts dried pepper mass. This \"parts per million of heat\" (ppmH) is found with the following calculation: \nformula_1\nPeak areas are calculated from HPLC traces of dry samples of the substance to be tested in 1 ml of acetonitrile. The standard used to calibrate the calculation is 1 gram of capsaicin. Scoville heat units are found by multiplying the ppmH value by a factor of 15. By this definition of ppmH, spicy compounds other than the two most important capsaicinoids are ignored, despite the ability of HPLC to measure these other compounds at the same time.\nScoville ratings.\nConsiderations.\nSince Scoville ratings are defined per unit of dry mass, comparison of ratings between products having different water content can be misleading. For example, typical fresh chili peppers have a water content around 90%, whereas Tabasco sauce has a water content of 95%. For law-enforcement-grade pepper spray, values from 500,000 up to 5 million SHU have been reported, but the actual strength of the spray depends on the dilution. This problem can be overcome by stating the water content along with the Scoville value. One way to do so is the \"D-value\", defined as total mass divided by dry mass.\nNumerical results for any specimen vary depending on its cultivation conditions and the uncertainty of the laboratory methods used to assess the capsaicinoid content. Pungency values for any pepper are variable, owing to expected variation within a species, possibly by a factor of 10 or more, depending on seed lineage, climate and humidity, and soil composition supplying nutrients. The inaccuracies described in the measurement methods also contribute to the imprecision of these values.\n\"Capsicum\" peppers.\n\"Capsicum\" chili peppers are commonly used to add pungency in cuisines worldwide. The range of pepper heat reflected by a Scoville score is from 500 or less (sweet peppers) to over 2.6 million (\"Pepper X\") (table below; Scoville scales for individual chili peppers are in the respective linked article). Some peppers such as the Guntur chilli and Rocoto are excluded from the list due to their very wide SHU range. Others such as Dragon's Breath and Chocolate 7-pot have not been officially verified.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Capsaicinoids.\nThe class of compounds causing pungency in plants such as chili peppers is called capsaicinoids, which display a linear correlation between concentration and Scoville scale, and may vary in content during ripening. Capsaicin is the major capsaicinoid in chili peppers.\nThe Scoville Heat Unit may be used to express the approximate pungency of other, unrelated TRPV1 agonists, sometimes with extrapolation for much hotter compounds. One such substance is resiniferatoxin, an alkaloid present in the sap of some species of \"Euphorbia\" plants (spurges). Since it is 1,000 times as hot as capsaicin, it would have a Scoville scale rating of 16 billion. In the table below, non-capsaicinoid compounds are italicized. The ratings for piperine (150,000 SHU) and gingerol (60,000 SHU) for example are comparative estimates and are not official Scoville ratings. While the ratings are expressed in Scoville Heat Units (SHU), they do not technically belong on the official Scoville scale because the scale is scientifically designed and defined exclusively for capsaicinoids found in chili peppers. \nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is related to the idea of atonement and sometimes mistakenly conflated with expiation. The discussion here encompasses usage only in the Christian tradition.\nChristian theology.\nIn the King James Version, New King James Version, New American Standard Bible, and the English Standard Version translates \"propitiation\" from the Greek word \"hilasterion\". Concretely it specifically means the lid of The Ark of The Covenant. The only other occurrence of \"hilasterion\" in the NT is in , where it is translated as \"mercy seat\" in all of the Bible translations named above as well as the Revised Standard Version and the New Revised Standard Version.\nFor many Christians it has the meaning of \"that which expiates or propitiates\" or \"the gift which procures propitiation\". (KJV) reads: \"And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.\" There is frequent similar use of \"hilasterion\" in the Septuagint, ff. The mercy seat was sprinkled with blood on Yom Kippur (), representing that the righteous sentence of the Law had been executed, changing a judgment seat into a mercy seat (; compare with \"throne of grace\" in ; place of communion, ().\nAnother Greek word, \"hilasmos\", is used for Christ as our propitiation in 1 John 2:2; 4:10; and in the Septuagint (; ; ). The thought in the OT sacrifices and in the NT fulfillment, is that Christ completely satisfied the just demands of the Holy Father for judgment on sin, by his death at Calvary (). \"TDNT\", however, takes a different view of \"Hebrews: \"\"If the author uses the ritual as a means to portray Christ's work, he also finds that in the new covenant the literal offerings of the ritual are replaced by the obedience of Christ (10:5ff.; cf. Ps. 40) and the Christian ministry of praise and mutual service (13:15-16; cf. Ps. 50). In other words, total self-giving, first that of Christ, and then, on this basis, that of his people, is the true meaning of sacrifice.\nGod, in view of the cross, is declared righteous in having been able to justify sins in the OT period, as well as in being able to forgive sinners under the New Covenant (; cf. , note).\nWriting in \"Harper's Bible Dictionary\" (1952), Methodist theologian Edwin Lewis summarizes Paul's teaching in Romans 3 that God's attitude toward sin is revealed \"through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus\" (Rom. 3:23-26). \"The nature of sin must be set forth through the very means through which reconciliation is to be brought about: this means the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ, which is therefore 'a propitiation' (v. 25 KJV). ... God's righteousness, which makes sin a barrier to fellowship, and God's love, which would destroy the barrier, are revealed and satisfied in one and the same means, the gift of Christ to be the Mediator between Himself and men.\"\nPropitiation and expiation.\nBook of Common Prayer.\nThe Church of England's Book of Common Prayer (1662), following the prayer of confession before reception of Holy Communion, the priest is to offer \"comfortable words\" which consist of a series of four verses from the New Testament. The final text is from 1 John 2:1-2 (KJV): \"If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous; and he is the propitiation for our sins.\" The same text was used in the American editions of 1789 and 1928. However, in the Episcopal Church's 1979 Book of Common Prayer, in the Rite One form, \"propitiation\" was changed to read \"perfect offering,\" and with the rest of verse 2 added: \"and not for ours only, but for the sins of the whole world.\"\nReformation theology.\nThe case for translating \"hilasterion\" as \"expiation\" instead of \"propitiation\" was put forward by British scholar C. H. Dodd in 1935 and at first gained wide support. Scottish scholars Francis Davidson and G.T. Thompson, writing in \"The New Bible Commentary\", first published in 1953, state that \"The idea is not that of conciliation of an angry God by sinful humanity, but of expiation of sin by a merciful God through the atoning death of His Son. It does not necessarily exclude, however, the reality of righteous wrath because of sin.\" The Anglican theologian and biblical scholar Austin Farrer, writing a quarter century after Dodd, argued that Paul's words in Romans 3 should be translated in terms of expiation rather than propitiation: \"God himself, says St Paul, so far from being wrathful against us, or from needing to be propitiated, loved us enough to set forth Christ as an expiation of our sins through his blood.\"\n\"Hilasterion\" is translated as \"expiation\" in the Revised Standard Version and the New American Bible (Revised Edition), and as \"the means of expiating sin\" in the New English Bible and the Revised English Bible. The New Revised Standard Version and the New International Version translate this as \"sacrifice of atonement\".\nDodd argued that in pagan Greek the translation of \"hilasterion\" was indeed to propitiate, but that in the Septuagint (the oldest Greek translation of the Hebrew OT) that \"kapporeth\" (Hebrew for \"covering\") is often translated with words that mean \"to cleanse or remove\". This view was initially challenged by Roger Nicole in twenty-one arguments. Later it was also challenged by Leon Morris who argued that because of the focus in the book of Romans on God's wrath, that the concept of \"hilasterion\" needed to include the appeasement of God's wrath. Writing in the \"New Bible Dictionary\", Morris states that \"Propitiation is a reminder that God is implacably opposed to everything that is evil, that his opposition may properly be described as 'wrath', and that this wrath is put away only by the atoning work of Christ.\"\nPresbyterian scholar Henry S. Gehman of Princeton Theological Seminary in his \"New Westminster Bible Dictionary\" (1970) argued that for \"hilasterion\" in Romans 3:25 and \"hilasmos\" in 1 John 2:2 and 4:10, \"In these cases RSV more properly has 'expiation,' which means the extinguishing of guilt by suffering a penalty or offering a sacrifice as an equivalent. ... It is God who sent forth his Son to be the expiation of sin. Through the death of Christ sins are expiated or annulled, and fellowship is restored.\"\nLikewise, the Anglican theologian and biblical scholar Reginald H. Fuller, writing in \"The Oxford Companion to the Bible\", has noted that while the precise meaning of \"hilasterion\" is disputed, and while some translate it as \"propitiation\", this, he says, \"suggests appeasing or placating an angry deity-- a notion hardly compatible with biblical thought and rarely occurring in that sense in the Hebrew Bible. It requires God as its object, whereas in this hymn [Romans 3:24-25] God is the subject: 'whom God put forward.' ... Accordingly, the rendering 'expiation' is the most probable.\"\nIn his semantic study of \"hilasterion\" David Hill, of the University of Sheffield, claims that Dodd leaves out several Septuagint references to propitiation, and cites apocryphal sources.\nMany Reformed theologians stress the idea of propitiation because it specifically addresses dealing with God's wrath, and consider it to be a necessary element for understanding how the atonement as penal substitution makes possible Christ's propitiation for sins by dying in the place of sinners. Critics of penal substitutionary atonement state that seeing the Atonement as appeasing God is a \"pagan\" idea that makes God seem tyrannical.\nJ. I. Packer in \"Knowing God\", first published in 1973, designates a distinct difference between pagan and Christian propitiation: \"In paganism, man propitiates his gods, and religion becomes a form of commercialism and, indeed, of bribery. In Christianity, however, God propitiates his wrath by his own action. He set forth Jesus Christ, says Paul, to be the propitiation of our sins.\"\nJohn Stott writes that propitiation \"does not make God gracious...God does not love us because Christ died for us, Christ died for us because God loves us\". John Calvin, quoting Augustine from \"John's Gospel\" cx.6, writes, \"Our being reconciled by the death of Christ must not be understood as if the Son reconciled us, in order that the Father, then hating, might begin to love us\". Continuing the quote: \"... but that we were reconciled to him already, loving, though at enmity with us because of sin. To the truth of both propositions we have the attestation of the Apostle, 'God commendeth his love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us,' (Rom. 5: 8.) Therefore, he had this love towards us even when, exercising enmity towards him, we were the workers of iniquity. Accordingly, in a manner wondrous and divine, he loved even when he hated us.\"\nPacker also cites God's love as the impetus that provides Christ's sacrifice for the reconciliation of mankind and hence the removal of God's wrath. According to Packer, propitiation (and the wrath of God that propitiation implies) is necessary to properly define God's love; God could not be righteous and \"His love would degenerate into sentimentality (without Christ's death containing aspects of propitiation).The wrath of God is as personal, and as potent, as his Love.\"\nThus the definition of Christian propitiation asserted by Calvin, Packer and Murray holds that within God there is a dichotomy of love and anger, but through propitiation love trumps anger, abolishing it. \"'The doctrine of the propitiation is precisely this that God loved the objects of His wrath so much that He gave His own Son to the end that He by His blood should make provision for the removal of this wrath... (John Murray, \"The Atonement\", p. 15)'\"\nContemporary Catholic theology.\nThe Latin Vulgate translates \"hilasterion\" in Romans 3:25, and \"hilasmos\" in 1 John 4:10, as \"propitiationem\", and this is carried over to the Douay-Rheims Bible as \"propitiation\". This was also the case with the Confraternity Bible (New Testament 1941). However the promulgation of the encyclical \"Divino Afflante Spiritu\" in 1943, and the Second Vatican Council document \"Dei verbum\" in 1965, led to increased engagement with biblical manuscripts in the original languages, and ecumenical cooperation in Bible translation. A Catholic Edition of the Revised Standard Version New Testament was published in 1965. And an \"imprimatur\" was granted in 1966 to the Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocrypha by Richard Cardinal Cushing of Boston. Another ecumenical edition of the RSV was published as the Common Bible in 1973. In 1970 the first edition of the New American Bible was published. In both the RSV and the NAB, \"hilasterion\" in Romans 3:25, and \"hilasmos\" in 1 John 2:2 and 4:10, are translated as \"expiation.\"\nThe NAB includes a note on the use of \"expiation\" in Romans 3:25, explaining that \"this rendering is preferable to 'propitiation,' which suggests hostility on the part of God toward sinners. As Paul will be at pains to point out (5:8-10), it is humanity that is hostile to God.\"\nRaymond E. Brown in the \"New Jerome Biblical Commentary\" argues that in the NT sacrifice (\"hilasterion\") does not appease God's wrath but is best expressed from its Jewish roots (76.89\u201395) as atonement or expiation (82.73). Recent Catholic studies have depended heavily on the Trinitarian perspective presented by Jesuit theologian Edward J. Kilmartin:\n Sacrifice is not, in the first place, an activity of human beings directed to God and, in the second place, something that reaches its goal in the response of divine acceptance and bestowal of divine blessing on the cultic community. Rather, sacrifice in the New Testament understanding \u2013 and thus in its Christian understanding \u2013 is, in the first place, the self-offering of the Father in the gift of his Son, and in the second place the unique response of the Son in his humanity to the Father, and in the third place, the self-offering of believers in union with Christ by which they share in his covenant relationship with the Father.Jesuit theologian Robert Daly has explained the background for this renewed understanding. Daly points out that the initiative is entirely with the Father who \"loved us and sent his Son as expiation for our sins\" (1 John 4:10 NAB), and that \"when we see the sacrifice of Christ and the sacrifice of the Mass as a Trinitarian event, we see that, strictly speaking, there are no recipients.\" He compares the Eucharist to a marriage ceremony that receives its meaning by becoming the reality of one's life.\nThe French Jesuit theologian and biblical scholar Stanislas Lyonnet has explained the Johannine usage of the term, \"When St. John in two different places alludes first to the heavenly intercession of Christ before the Father (1 John 2.2), and then to the work accomplished here below by His death and resurrection (1 Jn 4.10), he declares that He is or that the Father has made Him a \"'hilasmos\" for our sins.' This term certainly carries the same meaning which it always has in O.T. Greek (Vulgate Ps 130.4) and which the Latin word \"propitiatio\" also always conveys in the liturgy: through Christ and in Christ, the Father achieves the plan of His eternal love (1 Jn 4.8) in 'showing Himself propitious,' that is in 'pardoning' men, by an efficacious pardon which really destroys sins, which 'purifies' man and communicates to him God's own life (1 Jn 4.9).\"\nAlong similar lines, the entry on \"sacrifice\" in the \"Theological Dictionary of the New Testament\", after reviewing the epistles of Paul and Hebrews, concludes that \"total self-giving, first that of Christ, and then, on this basis, that of his people, is the true meaning of sacrifice.\" And Cardinal-theologian Walter Kasper, in his book \"The God of Jesus Christ\", concludes that what Jesus effected was to give suffering \"eternal import, the import of love.\" Kasper points out that Gregory of Nyssa and Augustine of Hippo, working out of the New Testament, speak of a God who can freely choose to feel compassion, which implies suffering. Kasper adds that: \"It is Origen who gave us the clearest statement. In Origen's words: 'First God suffered, then he came down. What was the suffering he accepted for us? The suffering of love.' Origen adds that it is not just the Son but also the Father who suffers so. This is made possible by God's freedom in love.\"\nCurrently, however, some scripture scholars contend that using the word \"propitiation\" was a mistranslation by Jerome from the Greek \"hilast\u0113rion\" into the Latin Vulgate, and is misleading for describing the sacrifice of Jesus and its Eucharistic remembrance. One expression of the conclusion of theologians is that sacrifice \"is not something human beings do to God (that would be propitiation) but something which God does for human kind (which is expiation).\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In Ancient Greek, the word () means \"navel\". Among the Ancient Greeks, it was a widespread belief that Delphi was the center of the world. According to the myths regarding the founding of the Delphic Oracle, Zeus, in his attempt to locate the center of the Earth, launched two eagles from the two ends of the world, and the eagles, starting simultaneously and flying at equal speed, crossed their paths above the area of Delphi, and so that was the place where Zeus placed the stone. The Latin term is umbilicus mundi, 'navel of the world'.\nOmphalos is also the name of the stone given to Cronus.\nDelphi.\nMost accounts locate the Delphi omphalos in the adyton (sacred part of the temple) near the Pythia (oracle). The stone sculpture itself, which may be a copy, has a carving of a knotted net covering its surface and a hollow center, widening towards the base. The omphalos represents the stone which Rhea wrapped in swaddling clothes, pretending it was Zeus, in order to deceive Cronus. (Cronus was the father who swallowed his children so as to prevent them from usurping him as he had deposed his own father, Uranus.)\nOmphalos stones were believed to allow direct communication with the gods. Holland (1933) suggested that the stone was hollow to allow intoxicating vapours breathed by the Oracle to channel through it. Erwin Rohde wrote that the Python at Delphi was an earth spirit, who was conquered by Apollo and buried under the Omphalos. However, understanding of the use of the omphalos is uncertain due to destruction of the site by Theodosius I and Arcadius in the 4th century CE.\nArt.\n\"Omphalos\" is a public art sculpture by Dimitri Hadzi formerly located in Harvard Square, Cambridge, Massachusetts under the Arts on the Line program. The sculpture was removed on 2014, to be relocated to Rockport, Massachusetts.\n\"Omfalos\" is a concrete and rock sculpture by the conceptual artist Lars Vilks, previously standing in the Kullaberg nature reserve, Sk\u00e5ne County, Sweden. As of 2001, the sculpture belongs to the collections of Moderna Museet in Stockholm, Sweden.\nLiterature.\nIn literature, the word \"omphalos\" has held various meanings but usually refers to the stone at Delphi. Authors who have used the term include: Homer, Pausanias, D.H. Lawrence, James Joyce, Philip K. Dick, Jacques Derrida, Ted Chiang, Sandy Hingston and Seamus Heaney. For example, Joyce uses the term in the novel, \"Ulysses\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Billy Pitt had them built,\" Buck Mulligan said, \"when the French were on the sea but our's is the omphalos.\" [Chapter 1]\nOne of her sisterhood lugged me squealing into life.

The historical focus of the organization has been on educating the press and the public on the scientific and educational aspects of controversies surrounding the teaching of evolution and climate change. The NCSE opposes efforts to incorporate religious and pseudoscientific concepts into public school science education. Thanks to high-profile efforts in this field, it has been called the \"leading anti-creationist organization\" in the United States.\nThe NCSE is based in Oakland, California. As of 2012, its membership included more than 4,500 \"scientists, teachers, clergy, and citizens of varied religious and political affiliations.\"\nThe NCSE is a member of the National Coalition Against Censorship and is affiliated with the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).\nHistory.\nIn 1980 Stanley L. Weinberg, a high school teacher in Iowa, began to organize statewide Committees of Correspondence \"committed to the defense of education in evolutionary theory,\" based upon the committees of correspondence in pre-Revolutionary America. Their purpose was to keep interested parties informed about creationist efforts and to coordinate local political response. This grew into volunteer networks in most states that were coordinated by the\"Creation/Evolution Newsletter\" . By 1983, these committees and the \"Newsletter\" had been incorporated as the NCSE. In 1987, author and lecturer Eugenie Scott became the NCSE's first Executive Director and first full-time employee.\nIn the 1990s, based upon its monitoring of creationist efforts, it issued warnings of high levels of official anti-evolutionism and a \"sharp surge upwards\" in creationist attacks on evolution, including attempts to downgrade evolution from \"fact\" to \"theory\" (see evolution as theory and fact) or present the \"evidence against evolution\" (see objections to evolution).\nIn 2003, the NCSE gained international attention with Project Steve, a tongue-in-cheek response to the Christian creationist Discovery Institute's publication of A Scientific Dissent from Darwinism. The 2001 \"Dissent\" statement is signed by more than 100 (over 1,000 as of 2019) scientists, professionals, and degree-holders professing skepticism of the tenants and findings of Darwinian theory. In order to demonstrate the overwhelming scientific consensus in support of Darwinism, Project Steve collected several hundred signatures of active scientists with only the given name or nickname Steve (in honor of then-recently deceased paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould). Project Steve's signatory list rapidly outpaced that of the Discovery Institute's statement, and as of 2025 it has more than 1,500 signatories.\nIn 2005, the NCSE assisted the plaintiffs in \"Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District\", the most prominent case testing the constitutionality of intelligent design in public school science classes. The plaintiffs were suing Dover Area School District, a public school district in Pennsylvania, over changes in its biology curriculum to include the creationist textbook \"Of Pandas and People\" and requiring teachers to read a statement criticizing evolutionary theory. Nick Matzke, the NCSE's Public Information Project Director at the time, served as liaison to the legal team, and was responsible for uncovering the substitution of \"intelligent design\" for \"creationism\" within drafts of \"Of Pandas and People\", which became a devastating part of the testimony of Barbara Forrest (also an NCSE Director), and was cited extensively in Judge John E. Jones III's . \"Kitzmiller v. Dover\" remains a landmark case in United States constitutional law, and is considered to have effectively ended attempts to introduce intelligent design into public school science curricula. Eric Rothschild, lead counsel for the plaintiffs, is a member of NCSE's Board of Directors as of 2025.\nIn April 2008, the NCSE launched Expelled Exposed, a website critical of the film \"\" starring Ben Stein. The website received press attention and a large amount of traffic.\nIn 2012, the NCSE announced they would be engaged in efforts to keep climate change education, and global warming issues, safe from threats from special interests. They developed a series of lessons addressing climate change misconceptions and offered teacher training through a Teacher Ambassador program. That year, the organization also announced that it had reached 4,500 members who were \"scientists, teachers, clergy, and citizens with diverse religious and political affiliations.\"\nBeginning in 2010, the NCSE began a policy shift towards direct educational and material support for teachers in K-12 classrooms. The first \"Teacher Ambassadors\" were named in 2017, and the program of recognizing teachers dedicated to evolution and climate change education continues to the present. In the early 2020s, the NCSE developed and published a series of lesson sets on the \"Nature of Science.\" These materials are designed to provide students and educators with a fundamental understanding of the nature of scientific inquiry and the ability to distinguish between scientific and pseudoscientific claims.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic saw efforts by the NCSE to combat misinformation and promote trust in medical research and vaccination.\nAmanda L. Townley has been the organization's Executive Director since December 2023. She replaced Ann Reid, who had been appointed to the position in 2013. Previously, Eugenie C. Scott served as executive director for 27 years, from 1986 to 2013.\nActivities and programs.\nThe NCSE organizes its mission into three main programs: Science Education and Outreach (SEO), Catalyzing Action (CA), and Investigating Science Education (ISE). SEO covers classroom support and includes the Teacher Ambassador program. ISE is responsible for studying and reporting on the state of science education in the United States. The Catalyzing Action (CA) program has taken over the NCSE's historical purpose of coordinating political response to \"efforts to undermine the integrity of science education\", which can include local policies up to state and national legislation.\nThe NCSE maintains up-to-date listings of current events and information regarding creationist and antievolution advocacy, as well as about evolution education. Historian of science Michael Shermer describes its website as being one of \"the two best resources on the Internet on the evolution/creation topic\" (the other being TalkOrigins Archive). The NCSE also opposes intelligent design and other \"alternatives\" to evolution because it says they are misleading euphemisms for creationism.\nNCSE maintains a policy of religious neutrality and has cooperated with both religious and secular scientific and educational organizations like the National Academy of Sciences, the National Association of Biology Teachers, and the National Science Teachers Association. Its willingness to engage positively with, and avoid taking sides against, religiously minded supporters of evolution has been noted by historian of creationism Ronald L. Numbers and atheist author Richard Dawkins.\nLeadership.\nThe NCSE is led by an executive staff and a Board of Directors. The Executive Director is Amanda L. Townley, a science education researcher who was previously an Associate Professor at Georgia Southern University. Other staff members include Deputy Director Glenn Branch.\nKenneth R. Miller, a biologist and prominent critic of the intelligent design movement, is the President of the Board of Directors. Other members of the Board include Prosanta Chakrabarty, Joseph L. Graves Jr., and Eric Rothschild, lead counsel for the plaintiffs in \"Kitzmiller v. Dover\".\nIn the media.\nThen-Executive Director Eugenie Scott appeared on the current affairs program \"Uncommon Knowledge\" twice in 2001, where she debated creationist William A. Dembski. Scott made an appearance on ' for the 2004 episode \"'\". Scott offered a scientific perspective on the ID and creationism movements, noting that, \"it would be unfair to tell students that there is a serious dispute going on among scientists whether evolution took place. There's not.\" She further stated: \"a lot of the time the creationists ... they'll search through scientific journals and try to pull out something they think demonstrates evolution doesn't work and there is a kind of interesting rationale behind it. Their theology is such that if one thing is wrong with the Bible you have to throw it all out so that's why Genesis has to be interpreted literally. They look at science the same way. If one little piece of the evolutionary puzzle doesn't fit the whole thing has to go.\"\nIn November 2007 Scott discussed the NCSE's exploration of intelligent design on the NOVA documentary \"\", which documents the background and proceedings of \"Kitzmiller v.

Aguillard", "text": "US Supreme Court case concerning the constitutionality of teaching creationism\n1987 United States Supreme Court case\nEdwards v. Aguillard, 482 U.S. 578 (1987), was a United States Supreme Court case concerning the constitutionality of teaching creationism. The Court considered a Louisiana law requiring that where evolutionary science was taught in public schools, creation science must also be taught. The constitutionality of the law was successfully challenged in District Court, Aguillard v. Treen, 634 F. Supp. 426 (ED La.1985), and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed, \"Aguillard v. Edwards,\" 765 F.2d 1251 (CA5 1985). The United States Supreme Court ruled that this law violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment because the law was specifically intended to advance a particular religion. In its decision, the court opined that \"teaching a variety of scientific theories about the origins of humankind to school children might be validly done with the clear secular intent of enhancing the effectiveness of science instruction.\"\nIn support of Aguillard, 72 Nobel Prize-winning scientists, 17 state academies of science, and seven other scientific organizations filed amicus briefs that described creation science as being composed of religious tenets.\nBackground.\nModern American creationism arose from the theological split over modernist higher criticism and its rejection by the fundamentalist Christian movement, which promoted biblical literalism and, post 1920, took up the anti-evolution cause led by William Jennings Bryan. The teaching of evolution had become a common part of the public school curriculum, but his campaign was based on the idea that \"Darwinism\" had caused German militarism and threatened traditional religion and morality. Several states passed legislation to ban or restrict the teaching of evolution. The Tennessee Butler Act was tested in the Scopes trial of 1925, and continued in effect with the result that many schools did not teach evolution.\nWhen the United States sought to catch up in science during the 1960s with new teaching standards, which reintroduced evolution, the creation science movement arose, presenting what was claimed to be scientific evidence supporting young Earth creationism. Attempts were made to reintroduce legal bans, but the Supreme Court ruled in 1968's \"Epperson v. Arkansas\" that bans on teaching evolutionary biology are unconstitutional as they violate the establishment clause of the United States Constitution, which forbids the government from advancing a particular religion.\nIn the early 1980s, several states attempted to introduce creationism alongside the teaching of evolution, and the Louisiana legislature passed a law, authored by State Senator Bill P. Keith of Caddo Parish, entitled the \"Balanced Treatment for Creation-Science and Evolution-Science Act.\" The Act did not require teaching either creationism or evolution, but did require that, if evolutionary science was taught, then \"creation science\" must be taught as well. Creationists lobbied aggressively for the law. The stated purpose of the Act was to protect \"academic freedom\". Counsel for the state later admitted at the Supreme Court oral argument that the \"legislature may not [have] used the term 'academic freedom' in the correct legal sense. They might have [had] in mind, instead, a basic concept of fairness; teaching all the evidence.\" Governor David C. Treen signed the bill into law in 1981.\nThe District Court in Aguillard v. Treen, 634 F. Supp. 426 (ED La.1985), and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, 765 F.2d 1251 (CA5 1985), ruled against Louisiana, finding that its actual purpose in enacting the statute was to promote the religious doctrine of \"creation science\". An Arkansas District Court previously held in a 1982 decision in \"McLean v. Arkansas\" that a similar \"balanced treatment\" statute violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. Arkansas did not appeal the loss. Creationists believed the statute at issue in \"Edwards v. Aguillard\" had a better chance of passing constitutional muster, and so Louisiana appealed its loss in the trial and appellate courts to the Supreme Court.\nThe case was styled \"Edwards v. Aguillard\" because by the time the case reached the Supreme Court, Edwin Edwards had succeeded David Treen as governor of Louisiana, which was being sued, and Don Aguillard, a science teacher and assistant principal at Acadiana High School in Lafayette Parish, Louisiana, was the lead original plaintiff in District Court among a group of Louisiana teachers, students, parents, scientists, and clergy.\nResult.\nOn June 19, 1987, the Supreme Court, in a seven-to-two majority opinion written by Justice William J. Brennan, ruled that the Act constituted an unconstitutional infringement on the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, based on the three-pronged \"Lemon\" test, which is:\nThe Supreme Court held that the Act is facially invalid as violative of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, because it lacks a clear secular purpose (first part of the above \"Lemon\" test), since (a) the Act does not further its stated secular purpose of \"protecting academic freedom\", and (b) the Act impermissibly endorses religion by advancing the religious belief that a supernatural being created humankind.\nHowever, it did note that alternative scientific theories could be taught:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe Court found that, although the Louisiana legislature had stated that its purpose was to \"protect academic freedom\", that purpose was dubious because the Act gave Louisiana teachers no freedom they did not already possess and instead limited their ability to determine what scientific principles should be taught. Because it was unconvinced by the state's proffered secular purpose, the Court went on to find that the legislature had a \"preeminent religious purpose in enacting this statute\".\nDissent.\nJustice Antonin Scalia, joined by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, dissented, accepting the Act's stated purpose of \"protecting academic freedom\" as a sincere and legitimate secular purpose. They interpreted the term \"academic freedom\" to refer to \"students' freedom from indoctrination\", in this case their freedom \"to decide for themselves how life began, based upon a fair and balanced presentation of the scientific evidence\". However, they also criticized the first prong of the Lemon test, noting that \"to look for the sole purpose of even a single legislator is probably to look for something that does not exist\".\nConsequences and aftermath.\nThe ruling was one in a series of developments addressing issues related to the American creationist movement and the separation of church and state. The scope of the ruling affected public schools and did not include independent schools, home schools, Sunday schools and Christian schools, which remained free to teach creationism.\nDuring the case, creationists worked on a creationist biology textbook, with the hope of a huge market if the appeal went their way. Drafts were given various titles, including \"Biology and Creation\". After the \"Edwards v. Aguillard\" ruling, the authors changed the terms \"creation\" and \"creationists\" in the text to \"intelligent design\" and \"design proponents\", and the book was published as \"Of Pandas and People\". This supplementary textbook for school use attacked evolutionary biology without mentioning the identity of the \"intelligent designer\". Promotion of intelligent design creationism by the intelligent design movement eventually led to the textbook's use in a school district being challenged in another court case. \"Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District\" went to trial on September 26, 2005, and was decided in U.S. District Court on December 20, 2005, in favor of the plaintiffs, who charged that a mandate that intelligent design be taught was an unconstitutional establishment of religion. The 139-page opinion of \"Kitzmiller v. Dover\" was hailed as a landmark decision, firmly establishing that creationism and intelligent design were religious teachings and not areas of legitimate scientific research. Because the Dover school board chose not to appeal, the case never reached a circuit court or the U.S. Supreme Court.\nWendell Bird served as a special assistant attorney general for Louisiana in the case and later became a staff attorney for the Institute for Creation Research and Association of Christian Schools International. Bird later authored books promoting creationism and teaching it in public schools.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n is available from: https:// https:// https:// https:// http:// https:// "}

It mostly refers to evolutionary theory from either 1895 (for the combinations of Darwin's and August Weismann's theories of evolution) or 1942 (\"modern synthesis\"), but it can mean any new Darwinian- and Mendelian-based theory, such as the current evolutionary theory.\nOriginal use.\nDarwin's theory of evolution by natural selection, as published in 1859, provided a selection mechanism for evolution, but not a trait transfer mechanism. Lamarckism was still a very popular candidate for this. August Weismann and Alfred Russel Wallace rejected the Lamarckian idea of inheritance of acquired characteristics that Darwin had accepted and later expanded upon in his writings on heredity.http:// The basis for the complete rejection of Lamarckism was Weismann's germ plasm theory. Weismann realised that the cells that produce the germ plasm, or gametes (such as sperm and eggs in animals), separate from the somatic cells that go on to make other body tissues at an early stage in development. Since he could see no obvious means of communication between the two, he asserted that the inheritance of acquired characteristics was therefore impossible, a conclusion now known as the Weismann barrier.\nIt is, however, usually George Romanes who is credited with the first use of the word in a scientific context. Romanes used the term to describe the combination of natural selection and Weismann's germ plasm theory that evolution occurs solely through natural selection, and not by the inheritance of acquired characteristics resulting from use or disuse, thus using the word to mean \"Darwinism without Lamarckism.\"\nFollowing the development, from about 1918 to 1947, of the modern synthesis of evolutionary biology, the term neo-Darwinian started to be used to refer to that contemporary evolutionary theory.\nCurrent meaning.\nBiologists, however, have not limited their application of the term \"neo-Darwinism\" to the historical synthesis. For example, Ernst Mayr wrote in 1984 that:\nThe term \"neo-Darwinism\" for the synthetic theory [of the early 20th\u00a0century] is sometimes considered wrong, because the term neo-Darwinism was coined by Romanes in 1895 as a designation of Weismann's theory.\nPublications such as \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" use \"neo-Darwinism\" to refer to current-consensus evolutionary theory, not the version prevalent during the early 20th\u00a0century. Similarly, Richard Dawkins and Stephen Jay Gould have used \"neo-Darwinism\" in their writings and lectures to denote the forms of evolutionary biology that were contemporary when they were writing.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The university was established in 1865 by businessman Asa Packer. Lehigh University's undergraduate programs have been coeducational since the 1971\u201372 academic year. As of 2022[ [update]], the university had 5,911 undergraduate students and 1,781 graduate students. The university is classified with \"Doctoral Universities R1: Very High Research Activity\".\nCampuses.\nLehigh University is located in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, in the historically industrial Lehigh Valley region of eastern Pennsylvania. As of 2025, Lehigh encompasses , including of recreational and playing fields, and 150 buildings comprising four million square feet of floor space.\nIt is organized into three contiguous campuses on and around South Mountain, including:\nIn May 2012, Lehigh was the beneficiary of a gift of 755 acres of property in nearby Upper Saucon Township, Pennsylvania from the Donald B. and Dorothy L. Stabler Foundation. The gift from the estate of the long-time benefactor allowed the university to expand to its current size of 2,350 acres across all its campuses, and to consider new long-term potential uses for the university's new properties.\nAdministration.\nAs a private institution, Lehigh University is governed by its board of trustees, established in 1866.\nStudent governance.\nIn 1988, a student senate was created at the university to act as a governing body for undergraduate students, though it is empowered only to offer recommendations to the university's board. Still, the student senate still has an impact as it determines which clubs receive funding and which are authorized to be listed as official university clubs. A separate student senate exists for graduate students.\nAcademics.\nAs of 2022[ [update]], Lehigh has 584 full-time faculty members, with 95% holding a doctorate degree or the highest degree in their field.\nThe university offers undergraduate enrollment to all its colleges except its College of Education. The university operates on a semester system.\nColleges.\nCollege of Arts and Sciences.\nBased in Maginnes Hall, the College of Arts and Sciences offers a variety of humanities courses and visual arts programs and many music programs, including a marching band, the Wind Ensemble, and the Philharmonic orchestra. It has a dedicated Humanities Center, which is the site for many literature and other arts-based programs, including the Drown Writers Series. Lehigh also has a program called ArtsLehigh, oriented towards enhancing interest in the arts on campus.\nCollege of Business.\nLehigh introduced business and economics classes in 1893, with the first dedicated classes in economics being offered in 1897 and the first professor of economics being hired by the school, John L. Stewart, in 1898. Stewart is credited with creating the College of Business in 1918, establishing its original courses and teaching most of the classes himself. The college's inaugural class of 1922 numbered just 77. Through the 1930s the College of Business Administration stayed consistent, with around 10 professors and 350 students, and in 1938 was accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business, with enrollment that year jumping to 465, or 25% of the total student body. In 1952 the College of Business Administration began offering a five-year course in Industrial engineering and business, as well as graduate courses for Master of Business Administration degrees and was expanded to include Master of Science degrees by 1964. In 1957 the college moved from Copp\u00e9e Hall to the purpose-built Drown Hall.\nCollege of Education.\nMore than 7,000 students have received master's, education specialist, Pennsylvania Department of Education teaching certificates and certifications, doctoral degrees, and professional certificates from Lehigh's College of Education as of 2018[ [update]].\nP.C. Rossin College of Engineering and Applied Science.\nGraduates of Lehigh's P.C. Rossin College of Engineering and Applied Science invented the escalator and founded Packard Motor Car Company and the companies that built the locks and lockgates of the Panama Canal. Other notable alumni include Roger Penske, Lee Iacocca, John W. Fisher, and Terry Hart. Tau Beta Pi, the engineering honor society, was founded at Lehigh. In 2005, George Tamaro, a Lehigh University master's degree in civil engineering alumnus, was the John Fritz Medal award recipient, issued by the American Association of Engineering Societies.\nCollege of Health.\nLehigh's College of Health offers classes in biostatistics, epidemiology, population health data science, and others related to population health. The college opened on August 21, 2020, and was the first in the world to offer undergraduate, graduate, and executive degrees in population health. It is based at the Health, Science, and Technology (HST) building which opened in January 2022.\nUndergraduate admissions.\nAdmission to Lehigh University is classified as \"more selective\" by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. The Princeton Review gives Lehigh an \"Admissions Selectivity Rating\" of 95 out of 99.\nIn 2024, Lehigh University received 20,396 applications and admitted 5,289 students, resulting in an acceptance rate of 25%. Of those admitted, 1,501 students enrolled, yielding a matriculation rate of about 28%. Among the incoming Class of 2028, 50% of students submitted standardized test scores. For these students, the middle 50% SAT scores ranged from 1420 to 1520, and the ACT scores ranged from 32 to 35.\nIn 2023, the university received 18,415 applications. It extended offers of admission to 5,389 applicants, or 29%, after holistic review that includes examination of academic rigor, performance and admissions test scores. 1,531 accepted students chose to enroll, a yield rate of 28%. Of the 33% of incoming students in 2023 who submitted SAT scores, the interquartile range was 1370\u20131480; of the 10% of incoming students in 2023 who submitted ACT scores, the interquartile range was 31\u201333.\nRankings.\nIn its 2024 ranking of best U.S. colleges, \"The Wall Street Journal\", which ranks on the basis of student outcomes (70%), learning environment (20%), and diversity (10%), that analysis ranked Lehigh as 14th-best, overall, for that year. In the 2025 edition of \"Best Colleges Ranking\" published by the \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\", a site which does not report its methodology on its reporting page, Lehigh was ranked 46th (in a tie), in the \"National Universities\" category, with the following further category rankings: 25th for \"Best Undergraduate Teaching\", 26th for \"Best Value Schools\", tied for 51st for \"Best Undergraduate Engineering Programs\", and 45th for \"Most Innovative Schools\".\nAlong with three other Pennsylvania colleges, Dickinson College in Carlisle, Lafayette College in Easton, and Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Lehigh was a 2020 recipient of the Campus Sustainability Achievement Award issued by the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education in commemoration of its participation in the Solar Collaboration Project.\nLehigh University was nationally ranked in 2024, as \nAccording to PayScale's 2024 report, Lehigh ranks 1st among schools nationally for business majors by salary potential, with an early career median pay of $95,300 and a mid-career median pay of $194,900. Lehigh ranks 12th among universities for bachelor's degree salary potential, with a mid-career median salary of $147,300. Lehigh University ranks 26th among schools nationally for computer science majors by salary potential and 34th among schools nationally for engineering majors by salary potential.\nIn the 2024-2025 Forbes rankings of America's Top Colleges, Lehigh is ranked 64th overall, 44th among private colleges, 49th among research universities, and 28th among institutions in the Northeast.\nLehigh University's College of Business is ranked 23rd in Poets&amp;Quants' 2023 list of Best Undergraduate Business Schools. This reflects a rise from 27th place in 2022. Additionally, the university's part-time, online FLEX MBA program is ranked 13th among online MBA programs by Poets&amp;Quants for 2025.\nIn 2023, U.S. News &amp; World Report has identified Lehigh University's 1-MBA program as ranking 5th in the United States in salary-to-debt ratio. The publication recently evaluated MBA programs by the highest return on investment by examining starting salary-to-debt ratio from its 2023-2024 Best Business Schools (MBA) ranking.\nIn 2018, \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" ranked Lehigh's part-time MBA program 20th in the nation.\nIn 2012, \"BusinessWeek\" ranked Lehigh's College of Business 31st in the nation among undergraduate business programs. In 2012, \"BusinessWeek\" ranked Lehigh the seventh-best overall undergraduate finance program in the nation, and ranked its undergraduate accounting program the 21st-best in the nation.\nIn 2012, \"Entrepreneur Magazine\" and The Princeton Review named Lehigh the 24th- best undergraduate college for entrepreneurship.\nStudent life.\nFraternities and sororities.\nA large majority of Lehigh's social fraternities and sororities have their own university-owned houses; most of the fraternities and sororities are located along Upper and Lower Sayre Park Roads in a region known as \"The Hill\".\nLehigh has a decreasing level of student participation in fraternities and sororities; only about 21% of undergraduates are members of a fraternity or sorority. There are 10 fraternities, all of which are housed on campus, and eight sororities, all of which are housed on campus.\nLehigh's \"golden age of fraternities\" came in the mid-1980s when there were 36 fraternities on campus, all located on \"The Hill\". Sororities were notably forced to operate off campus. When the drinking age was increased to 21, fraternities started to run into frequent hazing incidents and disciplinary issues which resulted in many of them being forced by the school to disband in the 1990s. Many of their former houses were transitioned to sorority houses and a few were demolished to make way for more dorms. As of 2024, some of the houses on \"The Hill\" remain vacant.\nIn recent years, some former Greek houses have been converted to \"Themed Communities\" where students with a shared interest can live together. Currently, there are five such houses for upperclassmen.\nTraditions and student newspaper.\nLehigh's school colors, brown and white, date back to 1874, and the school newspaper, \"The Brown and White\", has been continuously published since 1894.\nLehigh University is home to several unique and cherished traditions, particularly during the annual Spirit Week leading up to the Lehigh-Lafayette football game.\nOne of the highlights is the Bed Races, where students form teams, decorate beds, and drag race them down Packer Avenue. Initially, students constructed their own beds to demonstrate their engineering skills.\nOrientation Week also features class flag presentations at \"The Rally,\" where each class is represented by an official flag passed down by their adopting class, 50 years their senior. The oldest surviving class flag dates back to 1889.\nThe Lehigh-Lafayette football rivalry, which began in 1884, is one of the most celebrated in college football, with the two schools having met more times than any other rivalry in the nation.\nThe Marching 97 band also plays a key role in Le-Laf Week, performing traditional Lehigh fight songs as they parade through campus. The \"Eco-flame\" tradition, originating in the 1970s when Professor Rich Aaronson invited the band to perform for his ECO 001 class, remains a staple of the week.\nCampus-wide events such as Lehigh After Dark's carnival and the GO campaign launch, which featured a Halsey concert, bring students from various class years and interest groups together, further enhancing the community spirit.\nROTC.\nSince 1919 Lehigh maintains a unit in the Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps, the Steel Battalion of the 2nd ROTC Brigade, which is headquartered in Jordan Hall on the mountaintop campus.\nAthletics.\nAs a member of the Patriot League, Lehigh competes in 25 different NCAA Division I sports. Lehigh's 2006 student-athlete graduation rate of 97% ranked 12th among all 326 NCAA Division I institutions. In 2002, it won the inaugural \"USA Today\"/NCAA Foundation Award for having the nation's top graduation rate of all Division I institutions.\nLehigh graduates have gone on to professional careers in the National Football League, Major League Baseball, Major League Soccer, and the National Basketball Association as players, scouts, coaches, and owners. Lehigh graduates have competed in the Super Bowl and won gold medals for the U.S. at the Olympic Games. While it is not a school sport, a number of Lehigh alumni, including Roger Penske, Al Holbert, and John Fitch, went on to successful careers in auto racing.\nBasketball.\nLehigh's fifth trip to the NCAA tournament in 2012 proved to be their most notable to date, thanks to its first-round game as a #15 seed on March 16, 2012, against the #2 seed Duke Blue Devils. Despite being a heavy underdog, thanks to CJ McCollum's 30-point heroics, the Mountain Hawks pulled off the stunning upset, defeating the Blue Devils 75-70 and making it only the sixth time that a 15th seed had defeated a second seed.\nFootball.\nLehigh University and nearby Lafayette College are rivals in sports. Since 1884, the two football teams have met over 160 times, making the game between the two programs, known as The Rivalry, the most played in the history of college football.\nThe rivalry between Lehigh and Lafayette is also the longest uninterrupted rivalry in college football; the teams have played annually since 1897. For the 150th meeting, the teams played before a sold-out Yankee Stadium in New York City.\nThe week leading up to the game features traditional festivities, including decorating fraternity houses, parties, rallies and the Marching 97 performing unexpectedly during classes the Friday before the game.\nWrestling.\nThe most storied athletic program at Lehigh is its wrestling team, which began in 1910. Over the past several decades, the Lehigh wrestling team has produced 158 All-Americans and had numerous squads finish with Top 20 NCAA national rankings, including finishing second in the nation in 1939. In 2008, the athletic department hired Pat Santoro, a two-time national champion and two-time winner of the EIWA Coach of the Year (2009, 2012) as Lehigh's head wrestling coach.\nHome dual meets and tournaments take place in Leeman-Turner Arena at Grace Hall, on the university's main campus. Commonly known as \"The Snake Pit\", it has been the home of Lehigh wrestling since 1942. In 2013, Grace Hall was converted into the Caruso Wrestling Complex, including a visiting area and Lehigh's College Wrestling Wall of Fame.\nIn March 2017, Lehigh wrestler and Bethlehem native Darian Cruz won the NCAA Division I national wrestling tournament, becoming Lehigh's first national champion since Zach Rey, Lehigh's current assistant wrestling coach, won the title in the heavyweight division six years earlier, in 2011.\nLacrosse.\nLehigh University's lacrosse program is a prominent part of Lehigh's athletic offerings, with both men's and women's teams competing at the Division I level. The men's team and women's team compete in the Patriot League.\nThe men's lacrosse team has achieved historic success over the years, including four Patriot League Championships. The team earned an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament in 2024 after rallying to defeat Boston University 11\u201310 in the championship game.\nThe Clery Act.\nOn April 5, 1986, Jeanne Clery, a 19-year-old Lehigh freshman, was raped and murdered in her Lehigh dorm room; the perpetrator, a Lehigh student, was apprehended, tried, and sentenced to death. In 1990, the backlash against unreported crimes on numerous campuses across the country led the United States Congress to pass the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, known as the Clery Act, which requires that colleges reveal information regarding crime on their campuses."}

According to Simpson, evolutionary rates differ from group to group and even among closely related lineages. These different rates of evolutionary change were designated by Simpson as \"bradytelic\" (slow tempo), \"horotelic\" (medium tempo), and \"tachytelic\" (rapid tempo). \nQuantum evolution differed from these styles of change in that it involved a drastic shift in the adaptive zones of certain classes of animals. The word \"quantum\" therefore refers to an \"all-or-none reaction\", where transitional forms are particularly unstable, and thereby perish rapidly and completely. Although quantum evolution may happen at any taxonomic level, it plays a much larger role in \"the origin taxonomic units of relatively high rank, such as families, orders, and classes.\"\nQuantum evolution in plants.\nUsage of the phrase \"quantum evolution\" in plants was apparently first articulated by Verne Grant in 1963 (pp. 458-459). He cited an earlier 1958 paper by Harlan Lewis and Peter H. Raven, wherein Grant asserted that Lewis and Raven gave a \"parallel\" definition of quantum evolution as defined by Simpson. Lewis and Raven postulated that species in the Genus Clarkia had a mode of speciation that resulted ...as a consequence of a rapid reorganization of the chromosomes due to the presence, at some time, of a genotype conducive to extensive chromosome breakage. A similar mode of origin by rapid reorganization of the chromosomes is suggested for the derivation of other species of Clarkia. In all of these examples the derivative populations grow adjacent to the parental species, which they resemble closely in morphology, but from which they are reproductively isolated because of multiple structural differences in their chromosomes. The spatial relationship of each parental species and its derivative suggests that differentiation has been recent. The repeated occurrence of the same pattern of differentiation in Clarkia suggests that a rapid reorganization of chromosomes has been an important mode of evolution in the genus. This rapid reorganization of the chromosomes is comparable to the systemic mutations proposed by Goldschmidt as a mechanism of macroevolution. In Clarkia, we have not observed marked changes in physiology and pattern of development that could be described as macroevolution. Reorganization of the genomes may, however, set the stage for subsequent evolution along a very different course from that of the ancestral populations\nHarlan Lewis refined this concept in a 1962 paper where he coined the term \"Catastrophic Speciation\" to describe this mode of speciation, since he theorized that the reductions in population size and consequent inbreeding that led to chromosomal rearrangements occurred in small populations that were subject to severe drought.\nLeslie D. Gottlieb in his 2003 summary of the subject in plants stated we can define quantum speciation as the budding off of a new and very different daughter species from a semi-isolated peripheral population of the ancestral species in a cross-fertilizing organism...as compared with geographical speciation, which is a gradual and conservative process, quantum speciation is rapid and radical in its phenotypic or genotypic effects or both. Gottlieb did not believe that sympatric speciation required disruptive selection to form a reproductive isolating barrier, as defined by Grant, and in fact Gottlieb stated that requiring disruptive selection was \"unnecessarily restrictive\" in identifying cases of sympatric speciation. In this 2003 paper Gottlieb summarized instances of quantum evolution in the plant species Clarkia, Layia, and Stephanomeria.\nMechanisms.\nAccording to Simpson (1944), quantum evolution resulted from Sewall Wright's model of random genetic drift. Simpson believed that major evolutionary transitions would arise when small populations, that were isolated and limited from gene flow, would fixate upon unusual gene combinations. This \"inadaptive phase\" (caused by genetic drift) would then (by natural selection) drive a deme population from one stable adaptive peak to another on the adaptive fitness landscape. However, in his \"Major Features of Evolution\" (1953) Simpson wrote that this mechanism was still controversial:\n\"whether prospective adaptation as prelude to quantum evolution arises adaptively or inadaptively. It was concluded above that it usually arises adaptively . . . . The precise role of, say, genetic drift in this process thus is largely speculative at present. It may have an essential part or none. It surely is not involved in all cases of quantum evolution, but there is a strong possibility that it is often involved. If or when it is involved, it is an initiating mechanism. Drift can only rarely, and only for lower categories, have completed the transition to a new adaptive zone.\"\nThis preference for adaptive over inadaptive forces led Stephen Jay Gould to call attention to the \"hardening of the Modern Synthesis\", a trend in the 1950s where adaptationism took precedence over the pluralism of mechanisms common in the 1930s and 40s.\nSimpson considered quantum evolution his crowning achievement, being \"perhaps the most important outcome of [my] investigation, but also the most controversial and hypothetical.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is best known for his silent films during the 1920s, in which he performed physical comedy and inventive stunts. He frequently maintained a stoic, deadpan facial expression that became his trademark and earned him the nickname \"The Great Stone Face\".\nKeaton was a child vaudeville star, performing as part of his family's traveling act. As an adult, he began working with independent producer Joseph M. Schenck and filmmaker Edward F. Cline, with whom he made a series of successful two-reel comedies in the early 1920s, including \"One Week\" (1920), \"The Playhouse\" (1921), \"Cops\" (1922), and \"The Electric House\" (1922). He then moved to feature-length films; several of them, such as \"Sherlock Jr.\" (1924), \"The General\" (1926), \"Steamboat Bill, Jr.\" (1928), and \"The Cameraman\" (1928), remain highly regarded. \"The General\" is perhaps his most acclaimed work; Orson Welles considered it \"the greatest comedy ever made...and perhaps the greatest film ever made\".\nKeaton's career declined after 1928, when he signed with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and lost his artistic independence. His first wife divorced him, and he descended into alcoholism. He was fired from MGM in 1933, ending his career as a leading man in feature films. He recovered in the 1940s, marrying Eleanor Norris and working as an honored comic performer until the end of his life. During this period, he made cameos in Billy Wilder's \"Sunset Boulevard\" (1950), Charlie Chaplin's \"Limelight\" (1952), and a variety of television programs. He earned an Academy Honorary Award in 1959. \nCritic Roger Ebert wrote of Keaton's \"extraordinary period from 1920 to 1929\" when he \"worked without interruption\" as having made him \"the greatest actor-director in the history of the movies\". In 1996, \"Entertainment Weekly\" recognized Keaton as the seventh-greatest film director, stating that \"his films offer belly laughs of mind-boggling physical invention and a spacey determination that nears philosophical grandeur.\" In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked him as the 21st-greatest male star of classic Hollywood cinema.\nCareer.\nEarly life in vaudeville.\nKeaton was born into a vaudeville family in Piqua, Kansas, the small town that his mother, Myra Keaton (n\u00e9e Cutler), was visiting at the time. He was named Joseph to continue a tradition on his father's side (he was sixth in a line bearing the name Joseph Keaton) and Frank for his maternal grandfather, who disapproved of his parents' union. His father was Joseph Hallie \"Joe\" Keaton who had a traveling show called the Mohawk Indian Medicine Company, which performed on stage and sold patent medicine on the side. According to a frequently repeated story, which may be apocryphal, Keaton acquired the nickname Buster at the age of 18 months. After the child fell down a long flight of stairs without injury, an actor friend named George Pardey remarked, \"Gee whiz, he's a regular buster!\" After this, Keaton's father began to use the nickname to refer to the youngster. Keaton retold the anecdote over the years, including in a 1964 interview with the CBC's \"Telescope\". In Keaton's retelling, he was six months old when the incident occurred, and Harry Houdini gave him the nickname (though the family did not get to know Houdini until later).\nAt the age of 3, Keaton began performing with his parents in The Three Keatons. He first appeared on stage in 1899 in Wilmington, Delaware. The act was mainly a comedy sketch. Myra played the saxophone to one side, while Joe and Keaton performed center stage, both wearing slapsoles, bald-headed wigs and \"Irish\" beards. The young Keaton goaded his father by disobeying him, and the elder Keaton responded by throwing him against the scenery, into the orchestra pit, or even into the audience. A suitcase handle was sewn into Keaton's clothing to aid with the constant tossing. The act evolved as Keaton learned to take trick falls safely; he was rarely injured or bruised on stage. This knockabout style of comedy led to accusations of child abuse and, occasionally, arrest. However, Keaton was always able to show the authorities that he had no bruises or broken bones. He was eventually billed as \"The Little Boy Who Can't Be Damaged\", and the overall act as \"The Roughest Act That Was Ever in the History of the Stage\". Decades later, Keaton said that he was never hurt by his father and that the falls and physical comedy were a matter of proper technical execution. In 1914, he told the \"Detroit News\": \"The secret is in landing limp and breaking the fall with a foot or a hand. It's a knack. I started so young that landing right is second nature with me. Several times I'd have been killed if I hadn't been able to land like a cat. Imitators of our act don't last long, because they can't stand the treatment.\"\nKeaton said he had so much fun that he sometimes began laughing as his father threw him across the stage. Noticing that this caused the audience to laugh less, he adopted his famous deadpan expression when performing. The act ran up against laws banning child performers in vaudeville. According to one biographer, Keaton was made to go to school while performing in New York, but only attended for part of one day. Despite tangles with the law, Keaton was a rising and relatively well-paid star in the theater. He stated that he learned to read and write late, and was taught by his mother. By the time he was 21, his father's alcoholism threatened the reputation of the family act, so Keaton and his mother, Myra, left for New York, where Keaton's career quickly moved from vaudeville to film.\nKeaton served in the American Expeditionary Forces in France with the United States Army's 40th Infantry Division during World War I. His unit remained intact and was not broken up to provide replacements, as happened to some other late-arriving divisions. During his time in uniform, he developed an ear infection that permanently impaired his hearing.\nFilm.\nSilent film era.\nKeaton spent the summers of 1908\u20131916 \"at the 'Actor's Colony' in the Bluffton neighborhood of Muskegon, Michigan, along with other famous vaudevillians.\"\nIn February 1917, he met Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle at the Talmadge Studios in New York City, where Arbuckle was under contract to Joseph M. Schenck. Joe Keaton disapproved of films, and Keaton also had reservations about the medium. During his first meeting with Arbuckle, he was asked to jump in and start acting. Keaton was such a natural in his first film, \"The Butcher Boy\", he was hired on the spot. At the end of the day, he asked to borrow one of the cameras to get a feel for how it worked. He took the camera back to his hotel room where he dismantled and reassembled it by morning. Keaton later said that he was soon Arbuckle's second director and his entire gag department. He appeared in a total of 14 Arbuckle shorts, running into 1920. They were popular, and contrary to Keaton's later reputation as \"The Great Stone Face\", he often smiled and even laughed in them. Keaton and Arbuckle became close friends, and Keaton was one of the few people, along with Charlie Chaplin, to defend Arbuckle's character during accusations that he was responsible for the death of actress Virginia Rappe. (Arbuckle was eventually acquitted, with an apology from the jury for the ordeal he underwent.)\nIn 1920, \"The Saphead\" was released, in which Keaton had his first starring role in a full-length feature film. It was based on a successful play, \"The New Henrietta\", which had already been filmed once, under the title \"The Lamb\", with Douglas Fairbanks playing the lead. After Keaton's successful work with Arbuckle, Schenck gave him his own production unit, Buster Keaton Productions. He made a series of 19 two-reel comedies, including \"One Week\" (1920), \"The Playhouse\" (1921), \"Cops\" (1922), and \"The Electric House\" (1922). Keaton then moved to full-length features.\nKeaton's writers included Clyde Bruckman, Joseph Mitchell, and Jean Havez, but the most ingenious gags were generally conceived by Keaton himself. Comedy director Leo McCarey, recalling the freewheeling days of making slapstick comedies, said, \"All of us tried to steal each other's gagmen. But we had no luck with Keaton because he thought up his best gags himself and we couldn't steal \"him!\"\" The more adventurous ideas called for dangerous stunts, performed by Keaton at great physical risk. During the railroad water-tank scene in \"Sherlock Jr.\", Keaton broke his neck when a torrent of water fell on him from a water tower, but he did not realize it until years afterwards. A scene from \"Steamboat Bill, Jr.\" required Keaton to stand still on a particular spot. Then, the facade of a two-story building toppled forward on top of Keaton. Keaton's character emerged unscathed, due to a single open window. The stunt required precision, because the prop facade weighed two tons, and the window only offered a few inches of clearance around Keaton's body. The sequence furnished one of the most memorable images of his career.\nAside from \"Steamboat Bill, Jr.\" (1928), Keaton's most enduring feature-length films include \"Three Ages\" (1923), \"Our Hospitality\" (1923), \"The Navigator\" (1924), \"Sherlock Jr.\" (1924), \"Seven Chances\" (1925), \"The Cameraman\" (1928), and \"The General\" (1926). \"The General\", set during the American Civil War, combined physical comedy with Keaton's love of trains, including an epic locomotive chase. Employing picturesque locations, the film's storyline reenacted an actual wartime incident. Though it would come to be regarded as Keaton's greatest achievement, the film received mixed reviews at the time. It was too dramatic for some filmgoers expecting a lightweight comedy, and reviewers questioned Keaton's judgment in making a comedic film about the Civil War, even while noting it had a \"few laughs\".\nIt was an expensive misfire (the climactic scene of a locomotive plummeting through a burning bridge was the most expensive single shot in silent-film history), and Keaton was never entrusted with total control over his films again. His distributor, United Artists, insisted on a production manager who monitored expenses and interfered with certain story elements. Keaton endured this treatment for two more feature films, and then exchanged his independent setup for employment at Hollywood's biggest studio, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). Keaton's loss of independence as a filmmaker coincided with the coming of sound films (although he was interested in making the transition) and mounting personal problems, and his career in the early sound era was hurt as a result.\nNew studio, new problems.\nKeaton's last three features had been produced and released independently, under Keaton's control, and fell short of financial expectations at the box office. In 1928 film executive Nicholas Schenck arranged a deal with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for Keaton's services. Keaton had little to say about the details of the MGM contract; he would no longer have any financial responsibility for his films, and even his salary had been pre-negotiated, without his own input. Charlie Chaplin and Harold Lloyd advised him against making the move, cautioning that he would lose his independence. But, given Schenck's desire to keep things \"in the family\" and Keaton's having to admit that his independent pictures hadn't done well, Keaton agreed to sign with MGM. He would later cite this as the worst business decision of his life in his autobiography.\nWelcomed to the studio by Irving Thalberg, with whom he initially had a relationship of mutual admiration, Keaton realized too late that the studio system MGM represented would severely limit his creative input. The giant studio was run along strict factory lines, with everything planned and budgeted in advance. The first of MGM's Keaton films was \"The Cameraman\" (1928), and Keaton sensed trouble immediately when he saw the script. \"It was as long as \"War and Peace\",\" Keaton recalled. \"I took out 40 useless characters and a couple of subplots. These guys didn't realize\u2014they \"still\" don't realize\u2014that the best comedies are simple. I said, 'I'd like to do something with a drunk and a fat lady and a kid. Get 'em for me.' At my studio they would have the characters I wanted in 10 minutes. But not MGM. You had to requisition a toothpick in triplicate. I just stood there, and everybody is hassling.\" MGM wanted only Keaton the star, Keaton the creator was considered a waste of time and money because \"in the time it took him to develop a project, he could have appeared in two or three pictures set up by the studio's production staff.\"\nWhen the studio began making talking films, Keaton was enthused about the new technology and wanted to make his next film, \"Spite Marriage\", with sound. MGM refused, because the film was more valuable in silent form; it could be shown around the world in theaters that had not converted to sound. Also, soundstages were then at a premium, and MGM usually reserved them for dramatic productions. MGM also forced Keaton to use a stunt double during some of the more dangerous scenes to protect its investment, something he had never done in his heyday: \"Stuntmen don't get you laughs,\" Keaton had said.\nIn the first Keaton pictures with sound, he and his fellow actors would shoot each scene three times: once in English, once in Spanish, and once in either French or German. The actors would phonetically memorize the foreign-language scripts a few lines at a time and shoot immediately after. This is discussed in the TCM documentary \"Buster Keaton: So Funny it Hurt\", with Keaton complaining about having to shoot lousy films not just once, but three times.\nKeaton kept trying to persuade his bosses to let him do things his way. Production head Irving Thalberg would not permit Keaton to create a script from scratch because the studio had already purchased a stage property dating from 1917, \"Parlor, Bedroom and Bath\", at the suggestion of Lawrence Weingarten, who was Thalberg's brother-in-law and Keaton's producer. (\"We were desperate. We didn't know what to do,\" recalled Weingarten.) However, Thalberg did allow Keaton to stage the gags, including long stretches of pantomime, and agreed to send a crew to Keaton's own mansion for exterior shots. Keaton's relative freedom during this project resulted in a better than usual film. \"Apart from its exceptional quality,\" writes biographer James Curtis, \"the big takeaway from \"Parlor, Bedroom and Bath\" was its extraordinary commercial success. Performing better at the box office than any of Keaton's other MGM talkies, it pulled in worldwide rentals of $985,000 [$20,694,850 in 2024]. With a yield [net profit] of $299,000 [$6,281,990 in 2024], it became the most profitable of all of Buster Keaton's features, silent or sound.\" Curtis notes that it was also the only one of his MGM features that came in under budget and ahead of schedule. \nThe next project confirmed Keaton's fears about studio interference. He was handed a script titled \"Sidewalks of New York\" (1931), in which he played a millionaire becoming involved with a slum-neighborhood girl and a gang of rowdy kids. Keaton thought the premise was totally unsuitable, and was uncomfortable with his directors Jules White and Zion Myers, who emphasized blunt slapstick. \"I went over (Weingarten's) head and appealed to Irving Thalberg to help get me out of the assignment. Irving was usually on my side, but this time he said, 'Larry likes it. Everybody else in the studio likes the story. You are the only one who doesn't.' In the end, I gave up like a fool and said 'what the hell?' Who was I to say I was right and everyone was wrong?\" The film's emphasis on obvious slapstick made it unsuitable for the usual, prestigious Broadway premiere -- it opened simultaneously in two New York side-street theaters -- but the less discriminating audiences in small towns across America flocked to the film, resulting in an ultimate success.\nMGM had been featuring comical musician Cliff Edwards in Keaton's films. The studio replaced Edwards, who had substance-abuse problems, with nightclub comedian Jimmy Durante. The laconic Keaton and the rambunctious Durante offered enough contrast to function as a team, resulting in three very successful films: \"Speak Easily\" (1932), \"The Passionate Plumber\" (1932), and \"What! No Beer?\" (1933).\nTrouble behind the scenes.\nIn March 1932 studio chief Louis B. Mayer's office requested Keaton to report for work on a Saturday afternoon, to go through the motions of filming a scene for studio visitors. Keaton already had plans to attend a local college-baseball championship, where he was to be the home-team mascot. He sent his regrets to Mayer's office and kept his date at the ball game, only to receive a warning from Mayer the following Tuesday, suspending his pay until he resumed working.\nKeaton's behavior had become erratic by 1932. He was despondent over working conditions at the studio, and over his wife's antagonism toward him at home. This affected his films; he was sometimes visibly intoxicated on- and off-camera. \"I got to the stage where I didn't give a darn whether school kept or not, and then I started drinking too much,\" Keaton told interviewer Tony Thomas. \"When I found out that they could write stories and material better than I could anyway, what was the use of my fighting with them?\" The demoralized Keaton couldn't turn to production chief Irving Thalberg for support, because Thalberg was then on a medical leave that lasted eight months. This left Louis B. Mayer temporarily in sole charge of the studio, which made Keaton's standing at MGM even more fragile. Keaton's absences were costing the company $3,000 a day ($70,000 a day in 2025).\nThe last straw came when Mayer \"raided\" Keaton's dressing room during a wild party with Keaton's \"cronies and their girlfriends\". MGM staffer Sam Marx remembered the outcome: \"Buster ordered him out of the trailer, and Mayer ordered him out of the studio.\" Mayer couldn't oust him immediately, because Keaton's latest picture wasn't yet finished. Immediately after Keaton completed retakes on \"What! No Beer?\", he was fired \"for good and sufficient cause\" in a letter signed by Mayer on February 2, 1933.\nKeaton had been considered to appear in the studio's all-star success \"Grand Hotel\", only to have his role of the consumptive Kringelein taken by Lionel Barrymore. As \"What! No Beer?\" was nearing completion, Keaton\u2014\"sober, shaved, and calm\" as Keaton told his biographer Rudi Blesh\u2014pitched an idea to Irving Thalberg. He wanted to make a feature-length parody of \"Grand Hotel\" with an all-comedy cast: himself in the Lionel Barrymore role, Jimmy Durante in the John Barrymore role, Marie Dressler in the Greta Garbo role, Polly Moran in the Joan Crawford role, Henry Armetta in the Jean Hersholt role, Edward Everett Horton in the Lewis Stone role, and Laurel and Hardy sharing the Wallace Beery role. Edward Sedgwick would be directing. Keaton called his version \"Grand Mills Hotel\" (after the Mills Hotel, a Bowery flophouse). Thalberg was hesitant about burlesquing the dignified studio's own work but, seeing Keaton's obvious disappointment, said he'd think about it.\nAfter Louis B. Mayer had fired Keaton, Thalberg returned to the studio and persuaded Mayer that Keaton was still valuable to the company. Thalberg tried to resurrect Keaton's MGM career by offering to go ahead with the \"Grand Hotel\" satire, now retitled \"Gland Hotel\". Keaton, still furious at Mayer, refused to return to the studio and Mayer was not about to apologize. So ended Buster Keaton's starring career in feature films.\nEuropean productions.\nIn 1934, Keaton accepted an offer to make an independent film in Paris, \"Le Roi des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es\"; it was not released in the United States. During this period, he made another film in England, \"The Invader\". MGM needed a certain number of British-made films to comply with Britain's Cinematograph Films Act of 1927: if American studios wanted to release their films in Britain, they would have to accept and distribute a certain quota of British films. MGM distributed the Keaton film in England to satisfy the quota, but declined to release it in the United States, because the studio had already terminated Keaton's employment and was no longer promoting him as one of its stars. \"The Invader\" was acquired by American film importer J. H. Hoffberg in October 1935, and he retitled it \"An Old Spanish Custom\". Hoffberg released the film in the United States on the \"states-rights\" market, where independent exchanges bought regional rights to the film and offered it to local theaters in their territories. Because Hoffberg charged much lower rates than MGM had for a Buster Keaton feature, many independent companies grabbed it. Beginning in December 1935, \"An Old Spanish Custom\" played on double-feature programs in major theaters. \nEducational Pictures.\nIn 1934, Buster Keaton made a screen comeback in two-reel comedies for Educational Pictures. Most of these 20-minute shorts are simple visual comedies, with many of the gags supplied by Keaton himself, often recycling ideas from his family vaudeville act and his earlier films. Keaton had a free hand in staging the films, within the studio's budgetary limits and using its staff writers. The Educational two-reelers have far more pantomime than his earlier talkies, and Keaton is in good form throughout. The high point in the Educational series is \"Grand Slam Opera\" (1936), featuring Keaton in his own screenplay as an amateur-hour contestant.\nThe Educational series was very well received by theater owners and movie audiences, and Keaton was the studio's most important comedian. He was also its most expensive comedian (earning $2,500 per film, equal to $59,774 in 2025), and when Educational was forced to economize in 1937, the company could no longer afford to maintain two studios. Educational closed its Hollywood studio, thus forfeiting Keaton's services, and kept its cheaper New York studio going. The company replaced Keaton with New York-based stage star Willie Howard.\nGag writer.\nAfter Keaton's Educational series lapsed, he returned to MGM as a gag writer, supplying material for the final three Marx Brothers MGM films: \"At the Circus\" (1939), \"Go West\" (1940), and \"The Big Store\" (1941); these were not as artistically successful as the Marxes' previous MGM features. Keaton also directed three one-reel novelty shorts for the studio, but these did not result in further directorial assignments.\nColumbia Pictures.\nIn 1939, Columbia Pictures hired Keaton to star in two-reel comedies; he filmed two at a time over two years. These 10 films comprise his last series as a starring comedian. Columbia's short-subject comedians were generally paid a flat fee of $500 per film. Keaton, considered exceptional, was hired at double the usual rate. The director was usually Jules White, whose emphasis on slapstick and farce made most of these films resemble White's famous Three Stooges shorts. White sometimes paired Keaton with a second banana: either veteran comic Monty Collins or raucous comic dancer Elsie Ames. The insistent White directed Keaton whenever possible \u2013 to Keaton's mild annoyance \u2013 and only two Keaton shorts did without White's services because they were filmed on location, away from the studio. Those remaining two shorts were directed by Del Lord, a former director for Mack Sennett. Keaton's personal favorite was the series' debut, \"Pest from the West\", directed by Lord; it was a shorter, tighter remake of Keaton's little-viewed 1935 feature \"The Invader\". Trade critics loved it. \"Film Daily\" raved: \"One of the funniest shorts of the season. In fact, of any season. It just goes to prove that this Buster Keaton feller is a natural boxoffice gold mine that is not being mined. When a comedy shown cold in a projection room can make trade press critics howl in their seats, then you can bet your mortgaged theater that it's FUNNY [emphasis theirs].\"\nMoviegoers and exhibitors welcomed Keaton's Columbia comedies; and when Columbia began reissuing older comedies to theaters in 1948, Keaton's \"Pest from the West\" was chosen to launch the \"Comedy Favorites\" series (\"A 1939 Buster Keaton film and one of his funniest,\" noted \"Boxoffice\". \"It is good to see Buster back.\") Keaton's Columbia shorts came back to theaters from 1948 to 1952, and again from 1962 to 1964. Author John McElwee reports the boxoffice figures: \"\"Pest from the West\", the first series entry in 1939, brought back domestic rentals of $23,000, and subsequent ones tended to hover around that approximate figure (\"Nothing But Pleasure\" did $24,000, \"General Nuisance\" got $26,000). Columbia also realized profits from reissues of the Keatons after the war. \"The Spook Speaks\" was back for the 1949\u201350 season, and picked up $24,200, this in addition to the $28,500 it had realized on its initial run.\"\n1940s and feature films.\nKeaton's personal life had stabilized with his 1940 marriage to MGM dancer Eleanor Norris, and now he was taking life a little easier, abandoning Columbia for the less strenuous field of feature films. Resuming his daily job as an MGM gag writer, he provided material for Red Skelton and gave help and advice to Lucille Ball.\nKeaton accepted various character roles in both \"A\" and \"B\" features. He made his last starring feature, \"El Moderno Barba Azul\" (1946), in Mexico; the film was a low-budget production, and it may not have been seen in the United States until its release on VHS videotape in 1986, under the title \"Boom in the Moon\". The film has a largely negative reputation, with renowned film historian Kevin Brownlow calling it the worst film ever made.\nCritics rediscovered Keaton in 1949 and producers occasionally hired him for bigger \"prestige\" pictures. He had cameos in such films as \"In the Good Old Summertime\" (1949), \"Sunset Boulevard\" (1950), and \"Around the World in 80 Days\" (1956). In \"In the Good Old Summertime\", Keaton personally directed the stars Judy Garland and Van Johnson in their first scene together, where they bump into each other on the street. Keaton invented comedy bits where Johnson keeps trying to apologize to a seething Garland, but winds up messing up her hairdo and tearing her dress.\nKeaton also appeared in a comedy routine about two inept stage musicians in Charlie Chaplin's \"Limelight\" (released in 1952), recalling the vaudeville of \"The Playhouse\". With the exception of \"Seeing Stars\", a minor publicity film produced in 1922, \"Limelight\" was the only time in which the two would ever appear together on film.\nTelevision and rediscovery.\nIn 1949, comedian Ed Wynn invited Keaton to appear on his CBS Television comedy-variety show, \"The Ed Wynn Show\", which was televised live on the West Coast. Kinescope film prints were made for distribution of the programs to other parts of the country, since there was no transcontinental coaxial cable until September 1951. Reaction was strong enough for a local Los Angeles station to offer Keaton his own show, also broadcast live (\"The Buster Keaton Show\", 1950).\nProducer Carl Hittleman mounted a new series, again titled \"The Buster Keaton Show\", in 1951. This was an attempt to recreate the first series on film, allowing the program to be broadcast nationwide. The series benefited from a company of veteran actors, including Marcia Mae Jones as the ingenue, Iris Adrian, Dick Wessel, Fuzzy Knight, Dub Taylor, Philip Van Zandt, and his silent-era contemporaries Harold Goodwin, Hank Mann, and stuntman Harvey Parry. Keaton's wife Eleanor also was seen in the series (notably as Juliet to Keaton's Romeo in a little-theater vignette). Despite the hardworking cast and crew, the series was unsuccessful and only 13 half-hour episodes were filmed. Producer Hittleman audaciously reissued these same episodes in 1952 as though they were entirely new, with the series now titled \"Life with Buster Keaton\". \"Variety\" reporter Fred Hift reviewed it as a series premiere, noting that it was filmed without a studio audience: the \"lack of studio laughter weakened the climax of several of its acts.\" The producers fashioned a theatrical, hourlong feature film from the series, intended for the European market: \"The Misadventures of Buster Keaton\" was released on April 29, 1953 by British Lion, and it began playing on American television in September 1953. \"Roughly reproduced slapstick museum piece, it's most likely to amuse those too young to remember the real thing,\" reported Josh Billings in London's \"Kinematograph Weekly\". American television syndicators agreed, and marketed \"Life with Buster Keaton\" as a children's show. It continued to play for years afterward on small, low-budget stations.\nKeaton's periodic television appearances during the 1950s and 1960s helped to revive interest in his silent films. He appeared in the early television series \"Faye Emerson's Wonderful Town\". Whenever a TV show wanted to simulate silent-movie comedy, Keaton answered the call and guested in such successful series as \"The Ken Murray Show\", \"You Asked for It\", \"The Garry Moore Show\", and \"The Ed Sullivan Show\". Well into his fifties, Keaton successfully recreated his old routines, including one stunt in which he propped one foot onto a table, then swung the second foot up next to it and held the awkward position in midair for a moment before crashing to the stage floor. Garry Moore recalled, \"I asked (Keaton) how he did all those falls, and he said, 'I'll show you.' He opened his jacket and he was all bruised. So that's how he did it\u2014it \"hurt\"\u2014but you had to care enough not to care.\"\nSilent films revived.\nCritic and writer James Agee was key to reviving interest in Buster Keaton with his article about silent comedians in \"Life\" magazine in 1949, \"Comedy's Greatest Era\".\nIn 1954, Buster and Eleanor met movie-theater manager Raymond Rohauer, with whom they developed a business partnership to re-release his films. Actor James Mason had bought the Keatons' house and found numerous cans of films, among which was Keaton's long-lost classic \"The Boat\". Keaton had prints of the features \"Three Ages\",\"Sherlock Jr.\", \"Steamboat Bill, Jr.\", and \"College\" (missing one reel), and the shorts \"The Boat\" and \"My Wife's Relations\". Rohauer instructed Keaton to approach Mason for the films, but Mason -- reasoning that Keaton didn't have the money to preserve the films himself -- decided to donate them to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. \nRohauer then formed a new legal entity, Buster Keaton Productions, in September 1958. This gave Rohauer legal access to the old films at the Academy. Rohauer had not reckoned on Leopold Friedman, sole surviving trustee of the original Buster Keaton Productions, Inc. of the 1920s. Friedman was now general counsel and secretary for Loew's Incorporated, MGM's parent company, and he represented MGM's interests and the stockholders of the still functioning Buster Keaton Productions, Inc. MGM still held the copyrights on six Keaton features and seven short subjects produced by Joe Schenck. Rohauer and Friedman waged legal battles for control of the Keaton films -- in many cases Rohauer had the film prints but no rights, while Friedman had the rights but no film prints. The matter was finally settled in 1971, when Rohauer paid Friedman and the stockholders $50,000 for their percentage in the production company. \nNew fame in movies and television.\nOn April 3, 1957, Buster Keaton was surprised by Ralph Edwards for the weekly NBC program \"This Is Your Life\". The program also promoted the release of the fictionalized film biography \"The Buster Keaton Story\" with Donald O'Connor. In December 1958, Keaton was a guest star in the episode \"A Very Merry Christmas\" of \"The Donna Reed Show\" on ABC. He returned to the program in 1965 in the episode \"Now You See It, Now You Don't\". In August 1960, Keaton played mute King Sextimus the Silent in the national touring company of the Broadway musical \"Once Upon A Mattress\". In 1961, he starred in \"The Twilight Zone\" episode \"Once Upon a Time\", which included both silent and sound sequences. He worked with comedian Ernie Kovacs on a television pilot tentatively titled \"Medicine Man\", shooting scenes for it on January 12, 1962\u2014the day before Kovacs died in a car crash. \"Medicine Man\" was completed but not aired.\nPromotional and commercial films.\nBuster Keaton found steady work as an actor in TV commercials for Colgate, Alka-Seltzer, U.S. Steel, 7-Up, RCA Victor, Phillips 66, Milky Way, Ford Motors, Minit-Rub, and Budweiser, among others. In a series of pantomime television commercials for Simon Pure Beer made in 1962 by Jim Mohr in Buffalo, New York, Keaton revisited some of the gags from his silent-film days.\nIn 1961, Keaton appeared in promotional films for Maryvale, a housing development in the western part of Phoenix.\nReturn to feature films.\nIn 1960, Keaton returned to MGM for the final time, playing a lion tamer in a 1960 adaptation of Mark Twain's \"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\". Much of the film was shot on location on the Sacramento River, which doubled for the Mississippi River setting of Twain's book. In 1962 he signed on for a Canadian musical comedy feature, \"Ten Girls Ago\", starring teen idol Dion and featuring Keaton, Bert Lahr, and Eddie Foy, Jr. Keaton filmed his scenes as arranged, but the film endured a host of production problems and was never released.\nKeaton had a cameo in the all-star comedy \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\" (1963), appearing near the end of the film as Jimmy. He assists Spencer Tracy's character, Captain C. G. Culpepper, by readying Culpepper's ultimately unused boat for his abortive escape. (The restored version of that film, released in 2013, contains a scene where Jimmy and Culpepper talk on the telephone. Lost after the comedy epic's \"roadshow\" exhibition, the audio of that scene was discovered and combined with still pictures to recreate the scene.)\nIn 1964, Keaton was featured in his first theatrical film series since 1941. American International Pictures hired him to furnish comedy scenes for its successful \"Beach Party\" pictures. Keaton appeared in four: \"Pajama Party\" (1964), \"Beach Blanket Bingo\", \"How to Stuff a Wild Bikini\", and \"Sergeant Deadhead\" (all 1965). Director William Asher recalled:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I always loved Buster Keaton... He would bring me bits and routines. He'd say, \"How about this?\" and it would just be this wonderful, inventive stuff.\nKeaton's new popularity in movies prompted Columbia Pictures to re-release some of his vintage-1940 two-reel comedies to theaters. Columbia's home-movie division also sold two shorts, \"Pardon My Berth Marks\" and \"So You Won't Squawk\", in abridged form on silent 8mm film.\nDuring the autumn of 1964 Keaton was in Canada, starring in the color featurette \"The Railrodder\" for the National Film Board of Canada. He traveled from one end of Canada to the other on a motorized handcar, wearing his traditional pork pie hat and performing gags similar to those in films that he made 50 years before. A black-and-white companion film, \"Buster Keaton Rides Again\" (1965), documented Keaton at work during \"The Railrodder\", staging, improving, and rejecting gags on location.\nIn 1965, he appeared on the CBS television special \"A Salute to Stan Laurel\", a tribute to the comedian and friend of Keaton who had died earlier that year. He also played the central role in Samuel Beckett's experimental project \"Film\" (1965), directed by Alan Schneider. \nAmerican International co-produced an Italian comedy, \"Due Marines e un Generale\", co-starring the Italian comedy team of Franco and Ciccio. To make it more suitable for American audiences, the studio sent Buster Keaton, Fred Clark, and Martha Hyer to join the cast and crew in Italy. (While in Italy, Keaton made an appearance at the Venice Film Festival.) The completed film was released in 1966 as \"War Italian Style\"; his performance (as a German general) is almost entirely in pantomime. \nFor his next assignment, Keaton departed Italy for Spain, where Richard Lester's \"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\" was filmed in September\u2013November 1965. Keaton amazed the cast and crew by doing many of his own stunts. His increasingly ill health compelled director Lester to save Keaton's strength for the major stunts and use a double for distant, routine shots of Keaton running. \nKeaton's final appearance on film was in \"The Scribe\", a 1966 safety film produced in Toronto by the Construction Safety Associations of Ontario: he died shortly after completing it.\nStyle and themes.\nUse of parody.\nKeaton started experimenting with parody during his vaudeville years, where most frequently his performances involved impressions and burlesques of other performers' acts. Most of these parodies targeted acts with which Keaton had shared the bill. When Keaton transposed his experience in vaudeville to film, in many works he parodied melodramas. Other favorite targets were cinematic plots, structures and devices.\nOne of his most biting parodies is \"The Frozen North\" (1922), a satirical take on William S. Hart's Western melodramas, like \"Hell's Hinges\" (1916) and \"The Narrow Trail\" (1917). Keaton parodied the tired formula of the melodramatic transformation from bad guy to good guy, which Hart's characters went through, known as \"the good badman\". He wears a small version of Hart's campaign hat from the Spanish\u2013American War and a six-shooter on each thigh, and during the scene in which he shoots the neighbor and her husband, he reacts with thick glycerin tears, a trademark of Hart's. Audiences of the 1920s recognized the parody and thought the film hysterically funny. However, Hart himself was not amused by Keaton's antics, particularly the crying scene, and did not speak to Keaton for two years after he had seen the film. The film's opening intertitles give it its mock-serious tone, and are taken from \"The Shooting of Dan McGrew\" by Robert W. Service.\nIn \"The Playhouse\" (1921), he parodied his contemporary Thomas H. Ince, Hart's producer, who indulged in over-crediting himself in his film productions. The short also featured the impression of a performing monkey which was likely derived from a co-biller's act (called \"Peter the Great\"). \"Three Ages\" (1923), his first feature-length film, is a parody of D. W. Griffith's \"Intolerance\" (1916), from which it replicates the three inter-cut shorts structure. \"Three Ages\" also featured parodies of Bible stories, like those of Samson and Daniel. Keaton directed the film, along with Edward F. Cline. By this time, Keaton had further developed his distinct signature style that consisted of lucidity and precision along with acrobatics of ballistic precision and kineticism. Critic and film historian Imogen Sara Smith stated about Keaton's style:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBody language.\nFilm critic David Thomson later described Keaton's style of comedy: \"Buster plainly is a man inclined towards a belief in nothing but mathematics and absurdity ... like a number that has always been searching for the right equation. Look at his face\u2014as beautiful but as inhuman as a butterfly\u2014and you see that utter failure to identify sentiment.\" Gilberto Perez commented on \"Keaton's genius as an actor to keep a face so nearly deadpan and yet render it, by subtle inflections, so vividly expressive of inner life. His large, deep eyes are the most eloquent feature; with merely a stare, he can convey a wide range of emotions, from longing to mistrust, from puzzlement to sorrow.\" Critic Anthony Lane also noted Keaton's body language:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The traditional Buster stance requires that he remain upstanding, full of backbone, looking ahead... [in \"The General\"] he clambers onto the roof of his locomotive and leans gently forward to scan the terrain, with the breeze in his hair and adventure zipping toward him around the next bend. It is the \"angle\" that you remember: the figure perfectly straight but tilted forward, like the Spirit of Ecstasy on the hood of a Rolls-Royce... [in \"The Three Ages\"], he drives a low-grade automobile over a bump in the road, and the car just \"crumbles\" beneath him. Rerun it on video, and you can see Buster riding the collapse like a surfer, hanging onto the steering wheel, coming beautifully to rest as the wave of wreckage breaks.\nCritic James Agee wrote:\nKeaton's face ranked almost with Lincoln's as an early American archetype; it was haunting, handsome, almost beautiful, yet it was irreducibly funny... No other comedian could do as much with the dead pan. He used this great, sad, motionless face to suggest various related things: a one-track mind near the track's end of pure insanity; mulish imperturbability under the wildest circumstances... an awe-inspiring sort of patience and power to endure, proper to granite but uncanny in flesh and blood. Everything that he did and was bore out this rigid face and played laughs against it. When he moved his eyes, it was like seeing them move in a statue. His short-legged body was all sudden, machinelike angles, governed by a daft aplomb. When he swept a semaphorelike arm to point, you could almost hear the electrical impulse in the signal block. When he ran from a cop his transitions from accelerating walk to easy jogtrot to brisk canter to headlong gallop to flogged-piston spring\u2014always floating, above this frenzy, the untroubled, untouchable face\u2014were as distinct and as soberly in order as an automatic gearshift.\nFilm historian Jeffrey Vance wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Buster Keaton's comedy endures not just because he had a face that belongs on Mount Rushmore, at once hauntingly immovable and classically American, but because that face was attached to one of the most gifted actors and directors who ever graced the screen. Evolved from the knockabout upbringing of the vaudeville stage, Keaton's comedy is a whirlwind of hilarious, technically precise, adroitly executed, and surprising gags, very often set against a backdrop of visually stunning set pieces and locations\u2014all this masked behind his unflinching, stoic veneer.\nPork-pie hats.\nKeaton designed and modified his own pork pie hats during his career. In 1964, he told an interviewer that in making \"this particular pork pie\", he \"started with a good Stetson and cut it down\", stiffening the brim with sugar water. The hats were often destroyed during Keaton's wild film antics; some were given away as gifts and some were snatched by souvenir hunters. Keaton said he was lucky if he used only six hats in making a film. He estimated that he and his wife Eleanor made thousands of hats during his career. Keaton observed that during his silent period, such a hat cost him around two dollars (~$27\u201333 in 2022 dollars); at the time of his interview, he said, they cost almost $13 (~$116 in 2022 dollars).\nPersonal life.\nOn May 31, 1921, Keaton married Natalie Talmadge, his leading lady in \"Our Hospitality\", and the sister of actresses Norma Talmadge (married to his business partner Joseph M. Schenck at the time) and Constance Talmadge, at Norma's home in Bayside, Queens. In 1922 they had a son, Joseph, and in 1924 a second son, Robert.\nAfter Robert's birth, the marriage began to suffer. Talmadge decided not to have any more children, banishing Keaton to a separate bedroom; he dated actresses Dorothy Sebastian and Kathleen Key during this period. Natalie's extravagance was another factor, as she spent up to a third of her husband's earnings.\nKeaton had designed and built a modest cottage-like home as a surprise wedding gift for Natalie, but she was dissatisfied with its size and having no place for servants. Consequently Keaton sold it to MGM executive Eddie Mannix at cost, and commissioned Gene Verge Sr. in 1926 to build a estate in Beverly Hills for $300,000 ($5,141,000 in 2024). Neighbors included Tom Mix and Rudolph Valentino. Among famous subsequent residents were renter Marlene Dietrich and, later, Cary Grant with his wife, heiress Barbara Hutton. James Mason and his wife Pamela purchased the home in 1948. \nAfter attempts at reconciliation, Natalie divorced Buster in 1932, and changed the boys' surname to \"Talmadge\". On July 1, 1942, the 18-year-old Robert and the 20-year-old Joseph made the name change permanent after their mother won a court petition.\nWith the failure of his marriage and the loss of his independence as a filmmaker, Keaton descended into alcoholism. He was briefly institutionalized, according to the Turner Classic Movies documentary \"So Funny It Hurt\". He escaped a straitjacket with tricks learned from Harry Houdini. In 1933, he married his nurse Mae Scriven during an alcoholic binge, about which he later claimed to remember nothing. Scriven claimed that she did not know Keaton's real first name until after the marriage. She filed for divorce in 1935 after finding him with Leah Clampitt Sewell, the wife of millionaire Barton Sewell II, in a hotel in Santa Barbara. They divorced in 1936 at great financial cost to Keaton. After undergoing aversion therapy, he stopped drinking for five years.\nOn May 29, 1940, Keaton married Eleanor Norris, who was 23 years his junior. She has been credited with salvaging his life and career. The marriage lasted until his death. Between 1947 and 1954, the couple appeared regularly in the Cirque Medrano in Paris as a double act. She came to know his routines so well that she often participated in them in television revivals.\nDeath.\nKeaton was a heavy smoker. He died of lung cancer on February 1, 1966, aged 70, in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles. Despite being diagnosed with cancer in January 1966, he was never told he was terminally ill. Keaton thought that he was recovering from a severe case of bronchitis. Confined to a hospital during his final days, Keaton was restless and paced the room endlessly, desiring to return home. In a British television documentary about his career, his widow Eleanor told producers from Thames Television that Keaton was up out of bed and moving around, and even played cards with friends who came to visit the day before he died. He was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Hollywood Hills, California.\nInfluence and legacy.\nKeaton was presented with a 1959 Academy Honorary Award at the 32nd Academy Awards, held in April 1960. Keaton has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: 6619 Hollywood Boulevard (for motion pictures); and 6225 Hollywood Boulevard (for television).\nSix of his films have been included in the National Film Registry, making him one of the most honored filmmakers on that list: \"One Week\" (1920), \"Cops\" (1922), \"Sherlock Jr.\" (1924), \"The General\" (1926), \"Steamboat Bill, Jr.\", and \"The Cameraman\" (both 1928)\nA 1957 film biography, \"The Buster Keaton Story\", starring Donald O'Connor as Keaton was released. The screenplay, by Sidney Sheldon, who also directed the film, was loosely based on Keaton's life but contained many factual errors and merged his three wives into one character. A 1987 documentary, \"\", directed by Kevin Brownlow and David Gill, won two Emmy Awards.\nThe International Buster Keaton Society was founded on October 4, 1992: Keaton's birthday. Dedicated to bringing greater public attention to Keaton's life and work, the membership includes many individuals from the television and film industry: actors, producers, authors, artists, graphic novelists, musicians, and designers, as well as those who simply admire the magic of Buster Keaton. The Society's nickname, the \"Damfinos\", draws its name from a boat in Keaton's 1921 comedy, \"The Boat\".\nIn his essay \"Film-arte, film-antiart\u00edstico\", artist Salvador Dal\u00ed declared the works of Keaton to be prime examples of \"anti-artistic\" filmmaking, calling them \"pure poetry\". In 1925, Dal\u00ed produced a collage titled \"The Marriage of Buster Keaton\" featuring an image of the comedian in a seated pose, staring straight ahead with his trademark boater hat resting in his lap.\nJames Agee, critic and writer, analyzed his impact: \"Keaton worked strictly for laughs, but his work came from so far inside a curious and original spirit that he achieved a great deal besides...He was the only major comedian who kept sentiment almost entirely out of his work, and he brought pure physical comedy to its greatest heights. Beneath his lack of emotion he was also uninsistently sardonic; deep below that, giving a disturbing tension and grandeur to the foolishness, for those who sensed it, there was in his comedy a freezing whisper not of pathos but of melancholia. With the humor, the craftsmanship and the action there was often, besides, a fine, still and sometimes dreamlike beauty.\"\nRoger Ebert wrote, \"The greatest of the silent clowns is Buster Keaton, not only because of what he did, but because of how he did it. Harold Lloyd made us laugh as much, Charlie Chaplin moved us more deeply, but no one had more courage than Buster.\" In his presentation for \"The General\", filmmaker Orson Welles hailed Buster Keaton as \"the greatest of all the clowns in the history of the cinema... a supreme artist, and I think one of the most beautiful people who was ever photographed\". Welles said Keaton was \"beyond all praise... a very great artist, and one of the most beautiful men I ever saw on the screen. He was also a great director. In the last analysis, no one came near him.\" Critic Leslie Halliwell called Keaton \"the funniest and most inventive silent clown of them all.\"\nMel Brooks has credited Keaton as a major influence, saying: \"I owe (Buster) a lot on two levels: One for being such a great teacher for me as a filmmaker myself, and the other just as a human being watching this gifted person doing these amazing things. He made me believe in make-believe.\" He also admitted to borrowing the idea of the changing room scene in \"The Cameraman\" for his own \"Silent Movie\". Keaton's \"Sherlock Jr\"., in which he walks into the movie he is projecting, was an influence Woody Allen's \"The Purple Rose of Cairo,\" in which a character walks out of a movie and into real life\".\" George Lucas was influenced by Keaton for the character of Jar Jar Binks in \"\". Most notably he borrowed from \"The General\", \"The Navigator,\" and \"Seven Chances\".\nThe 1993 American animated series Animaniacs includes a caricature homage to Buster Keaton. Through its use of visual gags, physical comedy, and deadpan expressions. hallmarks of Keaton\u2019s style, the show subtly acknowledges his influence on the art of slapstick.\nIn 1994, caricaturist Al Hirschfeld penned a series of silent film stars for the United States Post Office, including Rudolph Valentino and Keaton. Hirschfeld said that modern film stars were more difficult to depict, that silent film comedians such as Laurel and Hardy and Keaton \"looked like their caricatures\".\nIn 1996, \"Entertainment Weekly\" recognized Keaton as the seventh-greatest film director, writing that \"More than Chaplin, Keaton understood movies: He knew they consisted of a four-sided frame in which resided a malleable reality off which his persona could bounce. A vaudeville child star, Keaton grew up to be a tinkerer, an athlete, a visual mathematician; his films offer belly laughs of mind-boggling physical invention and a spacey determination that nears philosophical grandeur.\"\nActor and stunt performer Johnny Knoxville cites Keaton as an inspiration when coming up with ideas for \"Jackass\" projects. He re-enacted a famous Keaton stunt for the finale of \"Jackass Number Two\". Comedian Richard Lewis stated that Keaton was his prime inspiration, and spoke of having a close friendship with Keaton's widow Eleanor. Lewis was particularly moved by the fact that Eleanor said his eyes looked like Keaton's.\nIn 2012, Kino Lorber released \"The Ultimate Buster Keaton Collection\", a 14-disc Blu-ray box set of Keaton's work, including 11 of his feature films. In 2016, Tony Hale portrayed Keaton in an episode of \"Drunk History\" focusing on the silent comedian's supposed rivalry with Charlie Chaplin, who was played by musician Billie Joe Armstrong. On June 16, 2018, the International Buster Keaton Society laid a four-foot plaque in honor of both Keaton and Charles Chaplin on the corner of the shared block (1021 Lillian Ave) where each had made many of their silent comedies in Hollywood. In honor of the event, the City of Los Angeles declared the date \"Buster Keaton Day\".\nIn 2018, filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich released ', a documentary about Keaton's life, career, and legacy. In 2022, critic Dana Stevens published a cultural history of Keaton's life and work, \"Camera Man: Buster Keaton, the Dawn of Cinema, and the Invention of the Twentieth Century\". It was followed a month later by James Curtis' biography '. In 2023, Keaton's life and work was depicted in the graphic biography \"Buster: A Life in Pictures\", written by Ryan Barnett and illustrated by Matthew Tavares.\nAnthony Lane wrote: \"He was just too good, in too many ways, too soon... No action thriller of the last, blood-streaked decade has matched the kinetic violence at the end of \"Steamboat Bill, Jr.\", in which a storm pulls Keaton through one random catastrophe after another. Anyone who thinks that the movie-within-a-movie is a recent conceit, the province of \"The Purple Rose of Cairo\" and \"Last Action Hero\", should check out \"Sherlock Jr.\", a film in which Keaton \"dreams\" himself into another film: he strolls up the aisle of the theatre, hops into the action, and fights to keep up with the breakneck changes of scene. As for \"The General\", where do you start? It's a film about a train, but it's also a spirited romance, peppered with bickering and longing, and its evocation of the Civil War period has never been surpassed... He is the first action hero; to be precise, he is a small, pale-faced American who is startled, tripped, drenched and inspired into \"becoming\" a hero.\"\nFilmography.\nDirected features:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

CIA paramilitary officers, working with their allies, attempted to destroy al-Qaeda and Taliban forces. The operation took place in the Shah-i-Kot Valley and Arma Mountains southeast of Zormat. This operation was the first large-scale battle in the post-2001 war in Afghanistan since the Battle of Tora Bora in December 2001. This was the first operation in the Afghanistan theater to involve a large number of U.S. forces participating in direct combat activities.\nBetween March 2 and March 18, 2002, 1,700 airlifted U.S. troops and 1,000 pro-government Afghan militia battled between 300 and 1,000 al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters to obtain control of the valley. The Taliban and al-Qaeda forces fired mortars and heavy machine guns from entrenched positions in the caves and ridges of the mountainous terrain at U.S. forces attempting to secure the area. Afghan Taliban commander Maulavi Saif-ur-Rehman Mansoor later led Taliban reinforcements to join the battle. U.S. forces had estimated the strength of the rebels in the Shah-i-Kot Valley at 200 to 250, but later information suggested the actual strength was of 500 to 1,000 fighters.\nBackground.\nOn September 11, 2001, a group of Islamic terrorists attacked the United States. They were led by Osama bin Laden, who was the leader of a group called Al-Qaeda. It was suspected that bin Laden was hiding in Afghanistan, under the protection of the Taliban.\nTo respond to this threat, the United States launched Operation Enduring Freedom on October 7, 2001. The goal was to remove the Taliban from power and eliminate al-Qaeda. To achieve this, the US worked together with a rebel group in Afghanistan known as the Northern Alliance. The Northern Alliance was made up of people from different ethnic backgrounds, such as Tajiks, Uzbeks, and Hazaras, who opposed the Taliban, which was primarily led by ethnic Pashtuns.\nThe US used a combination of airstrikes and special ground forces to help the Northern Alliance in its fight against the Taliban. They were able to quickly capture Taliban strongholds, and on November 13, 2001, they successfully took control of the capital city, Kabul.\nAround the same time, intelligence suggested that Osama bin Laden and the Al-Qaeda leaders had taken refuge in a training camp located in the Tora Bora mountains near Jalalabad, Nangarhar Province in Eastern Afghanistan. Unlike previous battle areas in Northern Afghanistan, this region was mainly inhabited by Pashtuns.\nThe United States wanted the Northern Alliance to help them attack Al-Qaeda in Tora Bora, but the Tajik and Uzbek warlords of the Northern Alliance refused. They were not willing to enter the hostile Pashtun areas in the east or south. So, the United States had to find other allies for the assault.\nThey managed to bribe Pashtun militias in the areas to join forces with them, and called this group the \"Eastern Alliance.\" Together, they launched an attack on the Al-Qaeda training camp in Tora Bora on November 30, 2001. However, these Eastern Alliance militias proved to be far less effective than the Northern Alliance had been. They did not have the same level of animosity towards Al-Qaeda and would leave the battlefield each night to break their Ramadan fast. Due to the lack of effective cooperation with the Eastern Alliance militias, Osama bin Laden and the Al-Qaeda leaders escaped from the Battle of Tora Bora.\nAfter the Tora Bora operation, there was a perception that the reason Osama bin Laden escaped was because there were no US forces in place to stop Al-Qaeda from fleeing into Pakistan. The commanders on the ground had asked for 800 United States Army Rangers to be sent to block these escape routes, but CENTCOM, the military authorities, declined their request. This perceived failure to deploy blocking forces would have a significant impact on the planning of Operation Anaconda.\nAround mid-January 2002, US officials received intelligence reports indicating that enemy forces, including Al-Qaeda, were gathering in the Shah-i-kot valley in Paktia Province, which was located about 60 miles south of Gardez. The Lower Shah-i-kot region was close to the Pakistani tribal lands, where many Al-Qaeda fighters were thought to have fled after the Tora Bora operation. As January progressed, US military officials started considering a potential attack on the Shah-i-kot valley.\nThe Shah-i-kot Valley, meaning 'the Place of the King' in Pashto, is about 9 kilometers long and 5 kilometers wide at its widest point. It consists of two main areas, the Lower Shah-i-kot and the Upper Shah-i-kot, running roughly parallel to each other. In the lower Shah-i-kot, there are several imposing mountains, with Takur Ghar being the most prominent at the southeastern end, and Tsapare Ghar to the northeast, which controls the northern entrance to the valley.\nThe valley is quite defendable, as its high ridges offer natural caves, crevasses, and other protected spots where guerrilla fighters can position themselves to shoot at the valley floor and access routes. During the Soviet-Afghan War, this area was also a battleground, as the Soviets fought mujahideen guerillas. The mujahideen, who opposed the Red Army in southeast Afghanistan, strategically positioned their defenses in Paktia province, mainly along the central mountain range. One critical highway between Gardez and Khost was a major supply route for the Soviet forces stationed in Khost. However, in 1981, the Afghan fighters successfully blocked this road and laid siege to Khost, forcing the Soviets to rely on airlift for resupply. The siege continued for seven years, and eventually, the Soviets were forced to retreat from the area.\nDuring the Soviet\u2013Afghan War, Mujahideen leader Malawi Nasrullah Mansoor was in charge of the valley and invited foreign jihadists to base themselves in the Lower Shah-i-kot. Mansoor fortified the valley, digging trench systems, building bunkers and firing positions into the ridgelines, many of which would be put into effect during the operation. Malawi Nasrullah Mansoor later joined the Taliban, becoming governor of Paktia Province before being killed in a battle with a rival warlord. Using his family's connections in the region Nasrullah Mansoor's son, Saif-ur-Rehman Mansoor, became the leading Taliban commander of Zurmat District in Paktia Province by 2002. The mujahideen fighters had successfully defeated the Soviet Army twice in this valley, and the Taliban-Al-Qaeda coalition expected events here to pan out in a similar fashion.\nIncreasing signals and human intelligence indicated a strong presence of Taliban, IMU and al-Qaeda fighters in the Shah-i-Kot Valley; approximately 200 to 250 fighters were believed to be wintering and possibly preparing for a spring offensive in the valley. The signal intelligence also raised the possibility that high-value targets (HVTs) were present in the valley among which were not only Saif Rehman, but also Tohir Yuldeshev, co-founder of the terrorist organization Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, and Jalaluddin Haqqani, whose tribal network controlled the area.\nJalaluddin Haqqani had a history of fighting against the Soviets with support from the CIA and Pakistan's intelligence agency, ISI. He was once seen as a potential alternative leader among the Pashtuns, apart from the Taliban. The CIA linked the Haqqani family to Osama bin Laden's escape from Tora Bora, an allegation that the family strongly denied. As a result, the Haqqani family became a target for American airstrikes, leading most of its members to flee across the border into Pakistan. However, despite their departure, Al-Qaeda fighters who had sought shelter in the family's tribal lands remained in the Shah-i-kot Valley.\nIn late January and February, a plan was developed to attack the Shah-i-kot Valley. The operation involved Afghan military forces (AMF) supported and guided by US special operators. Major General Franklin L. Hagenbeck, Commander of the 10th Mountain Division, was assigned to lead the Combined Joint Task Force Mountain responsible for the operation. The strategy was to have Afghan Pashtun militias launch an attack on the valley, similar to what had happened at Tora Bora. But this time, US special forces would be positioned in the eastern mountains to block any potential escape routes into Pakistan. The expectation was that Al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters would retreat in the face of the Afghan militias' assault, and the US forces would be able to capture them as they fled.\nThe US decided to place its trust in a Pashtun warlord named Zia Lodin to lead the Afghan tribal forces. The operation officer of Task Force Dagger, Mark Rosengard, explained why they chose to rely on the Afghan militias that had previously disappointed them during the Battle of Tora Bora. First, there were reports suggesting that the Al-Qaeda forces in Shah-i-kot Valley were mixed among 1000 Afghan civilians. In such a situation, it was crucial to have troops who could distinguish between local civilians and jihadist foreign fighters. There was concern about accidentally killing civilians and repeating the Soviet forces' mistakes, which led to the Afghans viewing them as occupiers. Another reason was to foster a sense of \"ownership\" among the Afghans over the victory. Rosengard wanted the local people to feel like they were the ones who had driven out the foreign Al-Qaeda fighters from their country. When asked whether such a concept could be embraced on a national level in a country as ethnically diverse as Afghanistan, Mark Rosengard responded that at least Zia Lodin seemed to grasp the idea.\nAn important element in the operation was a group called Advanced Force Operations (AFO), reporting to Task Force 11 (TF 11). Their role was to carry out risky reconnaissance missions deep within enemy territory. AFO was not a fixed organization; it was a concept coordinated by a special operations headquarters cell that could draw personnel from various special operations units based on the mission's needs. Pete Blaber was chosen to lead AFO's efforts in Afghanistan. It was decided to use U.S. conventional infantry. The forces used, consisting of the 187th Infantry Regiment (\"Rakkasans\") of the 101st Airborne Division, led by Colonel Frank Wiercinski, and soldiers of 1st Battalion, 87th Infantry Regiment, 10th Mountain Division, led by Lieutenant Colonel Paul LaCamera, were to be inserted by CH-47D Chinooks, supported by six AH-64A Apache helicopters and secure these blocking positions. In keeping with established strategy in Afghanistan, fire support was to be provided by United States Air Force units, rather than artillery. Further air support was provided by U.S. Navy units and French Air Force Mirage 2000Ds. The amount of conventional assets allowed in Afghanistan was limited by United States Central Command (CENTCOM) and civilian defense leadership. The final plan foresaw two major forces: TF Hammer and TF Anvil. TF Hammer consisted of Afghan militias and a small number of US special operators as the primary effort to assault the Shah-i-Kot Valley; their objective was to enter the valley from the north, assaulting through the villages of Serkhankheyl and Marzak, where intelligence indicated that the enemy was concentrated, and channel fleeing enemy into the TF Anvil, the Rakkasan blocking positions. TF Anvil consisted of TF Rakkasan and the 1\u201387 to set up blocking positions and prevent enemy forces from escaping.\nUnits involved.\nThe operation was composed of: \nSOF teams from Task Force K-Bar and Task Force 64 included: \nThese teams inserted into the outer edges of the valley to cut off any escape.\nOther units that took part are the B Co. 159th Avn Rgt, 75th Ranger Regiment, Joint Special Operations Command, the CIA's Special Activities Division, and the British Royal Marines.\nThe Afghan militia forces were made up of three Pashtun units. The first unit, led by commander Zia Lodin, had around 600 men. They were planned to use as the main force and given the name TF Hammer for the operation. They received advice and training from ODAs 594 and 372. The other Afghan units were led by Zakim Khan and Kamel Khan, each comprising about 400 to 500 fighters. Zakim's units partnered with ODAs 542 and 381, while Kamel's units worked with ODAs 571 and 392. These two forces were designated as TF Anvil.\nPrelude.\nDuring the planning phase of the operation, Advanced Force Operations (AFO) units carried out reconnaissance to gather intelligence about the Taliban and Al-Qaeda positions in Shah-i-Kot. Efforts to access U.S. intelligence databases had provided no useful information. Even extensive satellite imagery of the Shah-i-Kot area did not reveal much because the Al-Qaeda forces there were too lightly equipped and too adept at camouflage to stand out, unlike the easily recognizable Iraqi tank brigades in the First Gulf War.\nIntelligence operatives realized that they would have to rely mainly on human intelligence gathering (HUMINT) and intercepted signals (SIGINT) to gather insights about the situation in the valley. The commander of Delta Force, lieutenant colonel Pete Blaber ruled out any helicopter infiltration of AFOs into the area as not to alert the terrorists in the valley; in addition to AFOs conducting reconnaissance of routes into and around the valley on modified Polaris ATVs (often in adverse weather conditions on difficult terrain), two teams (codenamed India and Juliet) with 3 and 5 operators (respectively) of highly experienced Delta operators from their squadrons Reconnaissance and Surveillance Troop and elite Air Force combat controllers from the 24th STS climbed high into the mountains and gorges of the Shah-i-Kot, often in extreme weather conditions, to conduct environmental reconnaissance. Their vital intelligence was fed back to the AFO and would prove invaluable once the operation started. On February 28, three AFO teams were covertly infiltrated into the valley, one codenamed Juliet was made up of 5 Delta operators, a combat controller, and a signals intelligence specialist from the ISA, entered the valley on ATVs from the north, driving through the night in adverse weather conditions, eventually reaching a covert hide on the eastern side of the valley. Another team codenamed India, composed of three Delta operators, a combat controller, and an attached ISA operator walked into the valley through the same conditions to hide in the southwest of the valley, known as the \"Fish Hook\". The final team was known as Mako 31 and was composed of three SEALs from DEVGRUs Red Team, a USAF Combat Controller, and a US Navy EOD operator. They infiltrated the area on foot via the southern edge of the valley to set up an observation post on a terrain feature known as 'The Finger.' All three teams were tasked with confirming enemy strengths and dispositions including antiaircraft emplacements, ensuring the designated Rakkasan helicopter landing zones were clear of obstructions, and providing terminal guidance for air support both prior to and during the insertion of conventional forces. SOF teams from Task Force K-Bar and Task Force 64 were also inserted into the valley to establish observation posts which according to US planners \"had to be tenable, afford good reconnaissance, and cover the identified escape routes or 'rat lines' into Pakistan\"\nAfter reading the daily reports from the AFO team, general Tommy Franks became convinced that a major operation was necessary to deal with what appeared to be a significant enemy presence in the Shah-i-Kot Valley. The military authorities finalized their plan for the attack on the valley. Task Force Rakkasan were to air assault into the valley using CH-47D Chinook transport helicopters, supported by six AH-64A Apache attack helicopters. Their role was to occupy several blocking positions along the eastern ridgeline of Shah-i-Kot. Task Force Hammer, led by Commander Zia Lodin with 500 Afghan Pashtun units, would enter the valley through the northern entrance in a ground assault convoy. Before their ground assault, a planned aerial bombardment would target known enemy positions. As Task Force Hammer moved through the villages of Serkhankheyl and Marzak, where enemy forces were believed to be concentrated, the Task Force Rakkasan soldiers manning the blocking positions would be ready to engage any fleeing enemy forces. Additionally, two Afghan militias were assigned to create an outer cordon to prevent any Al-Qaeda or IMU stragglers from escaping into Pakistan. The operation was originally scheduled to be launched February 28, but was delayed until March 2 due to a severe snowstorm.\nBattle.\n1 March 2002.\nA day before the planned operation, two Mako 31 snipers found a group of foreign fighters that had established a position and were manning a DShK HMG on the peak where they planned to set up an observation post. The DShK overlooked the southeastern entrance to the valley through which the TF Rakkasan Chinooks were due to fly in 24 hours and, if it was not disabled before then, it could shoot down the Chinooks carrying the conventional forces. The SEALs came up with a plan to ambush the enemy in the pre-dawn darkness before the Rakkasans flew into the valley. At 4 A.M the next morning, the three SEALs from MAKO 31 quietly approached the enemy camp, intending to wait until shortly before the air assault was scheduled to begin before eliminating the fighters there. However, the SEALs were spotted by an Uzbek IMU insurgent and a brief firefight ensued. During the intense exchange, two of the SEALs' rifles jammed after firing just one shot. The third SEAL held off the enemy as his colleagues quickly cleared the jams and resumed firing, killing 5 out of the 7 foreign fighters. As another insurgent joined the firefight, firing a PKM, the SEAL team decided to break contact and called in an AC-130 which destroyed the enemy encampment with 105\u00a0mm rounds. The sound of the AC-130 firing alerted the Al-Qaeda fighters throughout the valley, who began firing their weapons into the air. However, this turned out to be a fatal mistake as the tracer rounds revealed their positions to the AFO teams, who noted the locations to be targeted by airstrikes later.\nThe SEALs proceeded to occupy the observation post. Upon searching the camp, they discovered that the Al-Qaeda fighters were well-equipped. Not only did the SEALs find plenty of ammunition for the DShK, but also a Soviet-style SVD Dragunov sniper rifle, several Kalashnikov assault rifles, at least one RPG-7 launcher with several rounds, a PK machine gun, and several fragmentation grenades. The SEALs also found documents that were written in both Arabic and Cyrillic scripts, indicating that the Arab Al-Qaeda fighters and the Uzbek and Chechen IMU fighters were not operating separately, but had formed cross-cultural teams. Among the documents was a notebook containing instructions on how to construct homemade bombs for blowing up bridges, buildings, buses, and cars.\n2 March 2002.\nCanadian and U.S. sniper teams and Afghan forces began to sweep the Shah-i-Kot valley area to root out rebel forces regrouping in the valley after the fall of the Taliban regime.\nTF Hammer/TF Anvil.\nAround midnight, the units of TF Hammer loaded into their vehicles and left their base in Gardez at for the Shah-i-Kot Valley in a convoy of 39 trucks, buses, and other vehicles. TF Hammer consisted of a large force of Afghan militia led by Zia Lodin and the Special Forces A-teams Texas 14/ODA 594 and Cobra 72/ODA 372. The road conditions were terrible due to a recent snowstorm that had turned the dirt roads into muddy and slippery terrain. This made progress challenging, especially in the difficult terrain.\nAs they moved, some trucks got stuck, and there was even an accident where a large bus turned over, injuring several fighters. The commanders ordered the trucks to use their headlights, destroying any element of surprise. As TF Hammer continued, it suffered from a lack of unit cohesion because of the transportation difficulties. A convoy led by Army Chief Warrant Officer Stanley L. Harriman of the Third Special Forces Group split off from the main TF Hammer force to reach the assigned observation point. Grim 31, an AC-130 aircraft providing fire support and reconnaissance for the assault, spotted Harriman's convoy and, due to a failure in its inertial navigation system, believed it was in a position away from friendly forces (this was due to a problem with the \"glint\" panels which should have identified the convoy as American.) Grim 31 engaged the column, resulting in the friendly fire death of Harriman and the wounding of several Afghan militias and U.S. special forces.\nThe main body of TF Hammer reached its pre-assault point around 06:15 and waited for the expected \"55 minute\" aerial bombardment of enemy positions. Miscommunication between Texas 14 and higher command meant the bombardment was not that extensive and consisted of six bombs. This was due to a bomb getting stuck in the launch bay of the B-1B that was on its bomb run. The next aircraft in line waited for the B-1B to receive permission to jettison the bomb and go round again. During this time, both bombers plus the additional two F-15Es claimed to have received a \"knock off\" call directing them to cease the bombardment. One of the F-15E pilots later acknowledged that this may have been a communication directing Grim-31 to cease fire. This lack of air support demoralized the Afghans and frustrated the special forces. The Afghan fighters, in trucks, were devastated by mortar fire registered in advance to strike fixed points on the road. The Afghans suffered forty or more deaths and injuries.\nAt this point, it became clear that the Al Qaeda fighters had been expecting an attack. The intense small arms and mortar fire, combined with the absence of close air support, caused the Afghan forces of TF Hammer to scatter and refuse to advance any further. This situation was reminiscent of the challenges faced during the earlier Tora Bora operation, in which the Afghan militias had similarly refused to advance in the face of enemy resistance. With no opportunity to alter the operation that had already been set in motion, the task of assaulting the Shah-i-Kot Valley had to be carried out by the troops of TF Anvil instead.\nTF Rakkasan.\nAt 05:00, the assault troops of TF Rakkasan boarded their CH-47 Chinook transport helicopters at Bagram Air Base and flew south towards the Shah-i-Kot Valley. The weather was cold and cloudy, and the soldiers bundled up in cold weather gear to keep warm. The six Chinooks carrying the Rakkasans were accompanied by two UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters and several AH-64 Apaches. The aircraft ran into significant troubles during the flight caused by foggy weather, and somehow the Chinooks passed the valley entrance significantly ahead of the Apaches, forcing the Rakkasans to drop off on \"hot\" landing zones (meaning that the insurgents were nearby and able to engage them immediately as they dropped off). The six Chinooks spread out and headed for their respective landing zones. As the security team rushed to secure the landing zones, the TF Rakkasan commander observed the valley with concern. He noticed that there were no signs of civilians in the towns below. No colors, no smoke, no animals, no hanging clothes \u2013 nothing to indicate people living there. It became clear that the civilians had been moved out and that there were only enemy combatants to be found there.\nAt 06:30 the first wave of Rakkasans and Mountain troops landed via Chinook helicopter along the eastern and northern edges of the valley to await the fleeing fighters at their assigned blocking positions. The terrorists appeared surprised and did not fire on the Chinooks at first, possibly due to them being distracted by TF Hammer's advance or because of ineffective communication between the foreign fighters themselves. This confusion bought the infantry invaluable time to take up security positions around the helicopter landing zone, and the first shots rang out as the Chinooks lifted off and departed. Due to TF Hammer having aborted the mission, they came under much heavier fire than they had anticipated after landing on their objectives and remained pinned down by heavy mortar fire and found themselves locked in a fierce firefight throughout the day. Orbiting Apache helicopters attempted to suppress enemy mortar teams, but ran into a wall of RPG and 12.7mm fire, with one Apache losing all of its electronics to an RPG hit. Instead of 200-250 fighters in the valley, as originally expected, post-assessment held that the area contained 750 to 1,000 terrorists dug in on the high ground around the valley. The insurgents used their ZPU-1 antiaircraft guns, DSHK, and small arms fire against the attack helicopters supporting the Rakkasans. \nThe Al-Qaeda fighters employed a tactic they had learned from the Afghan mujahideen during the Soviet-Afghan war. They fired their RPG rockets into the air, aiming for the self-destruct mechanism that automatically detonates the warheads after traveling a specific distance (920 meters). The insurgents used this method to set the rounds to explode near the aircraft and damage its hydraulic and electrical innards with its lethal flak bursts of shrapnel. Furthermore, the terrorists launched RPG barrages just ahead of the Apaches, another old mujahideen tactic that made it challenging for the Apaches to navigate through the valley safely. Two Apaches were taken out of the fight and forced to return to base early on the first day due to the heavy RPG and machine-gun fire. Upon returning to base, the crew discovered more than 30 bullet holes in the fuselage of one of the helicopters, in addition to damage to its left side caused by an RPG. According to journalist Steve Call, due to the intense hostile reception, only two out of the planned eight CH-47s managed to land in their designated landing zones, although this is disputed as other sources contend that there were only six chinooks, and all of them successfully landed without incident.\nDespite heavy opposition, Task Force Rakkasan managed to secure its blocking positions to the north by the middle of the morning. The presence of AFO teams in strategic high-ground locations played a crucial role in preventing the infantry from being overrun by the enemy. General Hagenbeck, who was in charge of the operation, was considering calling the mission off. However, Pete Blaber, the AFO commander, got on the radio and convinced him otherwise. Blaber insisted that this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity on the battlefield and that he intended to keep his teams in the Shah-i-Kot Valley, continuing to decimate the enemy through air strikes until they were no longer a threat. Throughout the day, TF Rakkasan soldiers fought relentlessly with the AFOs providing continuous support by calling in air strikes on Al-Qaeda positions. The Apaches also played a crucial role in protecting the Rakkasans on the valley floor during the intense battle. AFO's only frustration was that Rakkasan ETAC/JTAC had priority for calling in airstrikes over the AFOs requests and the other SOF reconnaissance teams in and around the valley.\nThe troops of the 1st Battalion, 87th Infantry Regiment in the southern landing zones faced the heaviest fighting. The men on the floor of the valley then picked up and began to patrol north again moving another 50 or so meters when an RPG was fired off a low foothill to the east. This round closed in on around 10 men, including the two Australians and most of the American leadership, landing in the snow and mud right amongst them but failing to detonate. The AQ then opened up with a DShK as the troops on the ground ran for the only cover on the valley floor in what became known as \"Hell's Halfpipe.\" In this engagement, Staff Sergeant Andrzej Ropel, and Specialist William Geraci, recently transferred in from the Division's Long Range Surveillance Detachment, led the squad under fire to a ridgeline above the \"Halfpipe.\" Ropel was able to kill the enemy observer calling mortar fire into the \"Halfpipe,\" and he and his squad could now see the surrounding terrain. Ropel was later awarded the Bronze Star Medal with a Valor device for his actions. The expectation of very limited enemy indirect fire capability meant that only a single 120mm mortar was brought in the first wave. The primary fire support for the troops was provided by two McDonnell Douglas AH-64 Apaches of the 3rd Battalion, 101st Aviation Regiment, 159th Aviation Brigade (\"Eagle Attack\").\nAs the AFO scouts investigated the southern area near the base of Takur Ghar, the prominent mountain in the valley, they came across an unusual scene. Among the Al-Qaeda fighters, they spotted a female combatant, a rare occurrence not frequently seen among the Taliban and Al-Qaeda forces in Afghanistan. This woman, in her mid-thirties, stood out with her ponytailed hair, a long scarf that draped all the way down to her knees, and an AK-47 slung across her back. Despite being armed, she was not engaged in combat; instead, she sat on a ledge at the mountain's base, cooking. Other enemy fighters, who had been actively sniping at the US scouts, would come down to join her for meals before returning to their positions. As the scouts prepared to move on, they called for mortar support from the 187th Infantry's mortar platoon positioned in the \"Halfpipe,\" obliterating the woman's position, along with the other Al-Qaeda fighters in the vicinity.\nSignalman Martin \"Jock\" Wallace, of the Australian Special Air Service Regiment, was awarded the Medal for Gallantry for his actions during the fighting. When a mortar team from the 1-87 Infantry was hit by enemy mortar fire, Wallace put himself in harm's way, collecting some of the wounded by dragging them into the creek bed, then dressing their wounds along with another SASR liaison officer. Throughout the day, the TACP forward air controllers and Special Forces teams that had infiltrated into the area the previous day assisted in calling in airstrikes from B-1, B-52, F-15, F-18 and F-16 aircraft, inflicting heavy casualties on the Taliban and al Qaeda fighters, but by no means silencing them. After nearly having their position overrun, the men in the southern landing zones were in a desperate position, pinned down all day and short of ammunition. Salvation came after dark in the form of an AC-130U Spooky gunship that unlike the faster-moving jets during the day, was able to loiter over the area and provide sustained firepower so the men could be airlifted out under cover of darkness; the group suffered 35 wounded (two chalks of which were casevaced by PaveHawk CSAR choppers) and none killed.\n3 March and 4 March 2002.\nBattle of Takur Ghar.\nOn the second day of the operation, General Hagenbeck and Colonel Wiercinski decided to make some changes. Because many soldiers in the southern blocking position of the 187th Infantry had been wounded, Hagenbeck chose to withdraw forces from the southern end of the valley. Instead, he relocated them to the northern position to assist the 3rd Brigade of the 101st Airborne Division in carrying out a sweep from the north to the south along the eastern ridge. Lieutenant Colonel Ron Corkran's 187th Infantry Battalion arrived in the northern region around 8:00 PM on March 3 and began their careful sweep southward, encountering no resistance. It became clear that the defenders had abandoned the valley floor. By the end of the day, they had successfully cleared a path to the base of Takur Ghar, and had gained a much better feel for the opposition, which had proven to be more formidable than initially anticipated.\nGeneral Hagenbeck also took steps to address the challenges the air assault team had faced on the initial day of the operation. The Apache helicopters had suffered significant damage, and it had become apparent that the AC-130 aircraft were susceptible to ground fire, making them unsuitable for daytime operations. Furthermore, there were not enough Air Force tactical controllers available to fulfill the demand for precision-guided strikes against al-Qaeda positions. To tackle these issues, CENTCOM deployed five A-10 Thunderbolt II aircraft. Not only were these robust aircraft far less susceptible to ground fire, but they could also remain over the battlefield during daylight hours and deliver accurate strikes without requiring the assistance of Air Force tactical controllers.\nIn the late evening of 3 March, Lieutenant Colonel Pete Blaber received notice from Brigadier General Gregory Trebon, commander of TF 11, that two SEAL fire teams commanded by Lieutenant Commander Vic Hyder were to be inserted into the Shah-i-Kot Valley. The two SEAL fire teams, Mako 30 and Mako 21, planned to establish an observation point on either end of the valley. One team would move to the peak of Takur Ghar, which commanded the southern approach to the Shah-i-Kot valley. Due to time constraints, a helicopter insertion would be needed for the teams to reach the peak before dawn. Hyder requested authorization to shift the insertion 24 hours to the next evening but was directed that insertion was critical to SOF providing support to the Operation. Originally, an insertion point east of the peak was identified, but due to uncontrollable time constraints, the SEALs of Mako 30 were forced into an insertion to the peak itself. Even though all overhead imagery showed no signs of life on the peak of Takur Ghar, Lieutenant Commander Hyder gave the team final guidance per special operation procedure that if any signs were seen, the mission would be aborted.\nThe SEAL fire team, Mako 30, was picked up by an MH-47 Chinook helicopter, at 23:23 on 3 March. However, the Chinook experienced engine difficulties and new MH-47s were dispatched to replace the original helicopters. This delay meant that the SEALs could not be inserted into the landing zone east of the peak until 02:30 on 4 March, which did not allow enough time to reach the peak before daylight. Blaber was notified that the SEALs were forced to insert on the peak to fulfill the order to infil Mako 30 that night. Nail 22, an AC-130H Spectre, reconnoitered the peak, and, seeing no enemy activity, declared the mountaintop secure. It was then called away to support other troops before the Chinook arrived.\nAt approximately 03:00, the Chinook attempted to land atop the mountain. As they approached, the pilots and SEALs observed tracks in the snow and other signs of recent human activity. As they discussed a possible mission abort, the helicopter was met with effective RPG fire. Two Rocket Propelled Grenades slammed into the helicopter, shutting down one of its engines, the electric system, and the hydraulic systems. Petty Officer First Class Neil C. Roberts had fallen out of the open ramp as the pilot had taken evasive actions. They first attempted to return and retrieve him, but the engine damage prevented proper control and the helicopter was forced to crash-land in the valley below, approximately 4 miles away. The SEAL team Mako 30, regrouped and was ferried by nearby units to another Chinook to go back to Takur Ghar and search for Roberts. The AC-130 was then directed to attack the large groupings of enemy combatants currently exposed on top of the mountain, one to three minutes before the Mako 30 was scheduled to arrive. When the Chinook dropped off the SEALs back on top of the mountain, they came under immediate fire, and Air Force combat controller Technical Sergeant John A. Chapman was seriously injured, along with two Navy SEALs. Mako 30 was forced off the peak due to the heavy fire, and believing him to be dead, left Technical Sergeant Chapman behind on the mountain, wounded, but alive. The Ranger quick reaction force (QRF) force located at Bagram Air Base and led by Captain Nate Self, was called in to search for the SEAL who fell out of the helicopter and Technical Sergeant Chapman, both of whom had been left behind on top of the mountain.\nAround this time command decided to change the frequencies for satellite radio communications which different units, including the AFO teams in their reconnaissance positions, were relying on to conduct and adapt the mission as the battle unfolded. One of the generals in overall charge of the events at Takur Ghar ordered the radio frequencies switched to prevent the plan being modified. Though the change may have been meant to enhance direct control of the rescue of the downed SEAL atop Takur Ghar, it had the critical effect of severely limiting communications between the different teams participating in the battle.\nAt 03:45, the Ranger quick reaction force was dispatched to the area. Though they were not given a specific mission, they were to establish communication for further instructions upon reaching Gardez, 10 minutes from the mountain. The quick reaction force consisted of 19 Rangers, a Tactical Air Control Party (Tacp), and a three-man USAF special tactics team carried by two Chinooks, Razor 01 and Razor 02. As Air Force rules prohibited AC-130 aircraft from remaining in hostile airspace in daylight after the crash of an AC-130 in Khafji in the Gulf War, the AC-130 support protecting Mako 30 was forced to leave before Razor 01 reached the landing zone, although the leadership was aware that Razor 01 was incoming. Unfortunately, the Razor Chinooks had not been equipped with functioning satellite radios to maintain communication with the headquarters in Bagram or, even more critically, the AFO Team's lead. Also, unfortunately, the pilot of the Razor 01 was not told about the enemy's anti-aircraft location on top of the mountain. Due to the satellite communications difficulties (which may have been caused by a little-known space weather effect caused by equatorial plasma bubbles), Razor 01 was mistakenly directed to the \"hot\" landing zone on the peak at . Because of this, the Razor 01 flew into the same enemy trap that the SEALs had flown into, with no one able to communicate the reality of the situation.\nAt approximately 06:10, Razor 01 reached the landing zone. The aircraft immediately began taking fire, and the right door minigunner, Sergeant Phillip Svitak, was killed by small arms fire. Drone footage of the incident showed the mortally wounded Technical Sergeant John A. Chapman drawing fire away from Razor 01 as it landed. This action earned him the Congressional Medal of Honor. A rocket-propelled grenade then hit the helicopter, destroying the right engine and forcing it to crash land. As the Rangers and special tactics team exited the aircraft, Private First Class Matt Commons, posthumously promoted to Corporal, Sergeant Brad Crose, and Specialist Marc Anderson were also killed, leading to a total of three Ranger casualties during the operation. The surviving crew and quick-reaction force at first attempted a daring assault on the Taliban positions but faced tough resistance from concealed insurgent bunkers, which caused the Rangers to retreat and take cover in a hillock where a fierce firefight began. Razor 02, which had been diverted to Gardez as Razor 01 was landing on Takur Ghar, returned with the rest of the quick-reaction force and Lieutenant Commander Hyder at 06:25. With the help of the new arrivals and close air support, the force was able to consolidate its position on the peak. The quick reaction force's Chalk 2 moved up the mountain to assist Chalk 1. While air force jets provided suppressive fire on the mountain top with individual gun runs since Mako 30 was less than north of the peak and Chalk 1 with its downed MH-47 was less than 100 m south of the peak. Hyder saw the need to assist Mako 21 who at that time had two dead and two injured, one of them non-ambulatory. It was obvious from this viewpoint that the proximity of friendly forces to the enemy positions was preventing sufficient suppressive firepower from being used due to danger close distance to both Mako 30 and quick reaction force chalk 1. Hyder directed the Chalk 2 leader to continue mission up the mountain and moved, alone, to link up with Mako 21 in order to assist that team's movement away from the peak thereby creating a better situation for air assets to support by fire. An enemy counterattack midday mortally wounded Senior Airman Jason D. Cunningham, a pararescueman. The wounded were refused medical evacuation during the daylight hours, due to risk of another downed helicopter. Mako 30 and Lt. Cmdr. Hyder moved down the mountain with their wounded. Through threat of nearby enemy response elements, hypothermia and shock of wounded personnel, and across nearly 30\" of snow in extreme terrain, Mako 21 found a site suitable for an MH-47. The SEAL team set up defenses, attempted to warm the wounded, and waited for dark when a recovery would be attempted.\nAustralian Special Air Service Regiment (SASR) soldiers inserted with a United States Air Force Combat Controller had infiltrated the area prior to the first helicopter crash undetected as part of a long range reconnaissance mission when the Chinooks went down. They remained undetected in an observation post through the firefight and proved critical in co-ordinating multiple Coalition air strikes to prevent the al-Qaeda fighters from overrunning the downed aircraft, to devastating effect. This, plus the actions of the two SASR officers working with the 10th Mountain Division, earned the commander of the Australian SASR force in Afghanistan the US Bronze Star for his unit's outstanding contribution to the war on terrorism. Australian soldiers had utilised 'virtual reality' style software for mission rehearsal prior to insertion, and this contributed significantly to their situational awareness in the darkness and poor weather conditions. This was the first time this capability had been used for a live combat mission.\nAt around 20:00, the quick-reaction force and Mako 30/21 were exfiltrated from the Takur Ghar peak. As a result of this action, both Technical Sergeant Chapman and Senior Airman Cunningham were awarded the Air Force Cross, the second-highest award for bravery. In 2018, Chapman's Air Force Cross was upgraded to the Medal of Honor and he was promoted posthumously to the rank of Master Sergeant. US and Afghan sources believe at least 200 Taliban and Al Qaida fighters were killed during the initial assault and subsequent rescue mission.\nAlso on March 4, the 2nd Battalion of the Rakkasans air assaulted into the eastern end of the valley, immediately attacking the heights under Apache cover. Meanwhile, the 3rd battalion were dropped into the northern end of the valley with the objective of linking up with the stranded forces at the blocking positions. Supported by 16 Apaches, 5 USMC Cobras helicopters and several A-10A ground attack aircraft; the Rakkasans methodically cleared an estimated 130 caves, 22 bunkers and 40 buildings to finally secure the valley.\nFate of Roberts.\nIt is not certain whether the sailor died immediately or was killed by opposing soldiers. There is a possibility that Roberts was captured by the al Qaeda fighters, and executed later with a single shot to the back of the head (One of the feeds showed a group of 8-10 fighters huddling around what appeared to be a body; both GRIM 32 and MAKO 30 noted that an IR strobe was active, a video feed showed the fighters passing the IR strobe around). This report has not been confirmed. Major General Frank Hagenbeck did confirm that al-Qaeda fighters were seen (on live video feed from a Predator drone orbiting the firefight) chasing Roberts, and later dragging his body away from the spot where he fell. Another feed from the same Predator showed a puff of heat [from a rifle] and the indistinct figure in front of it fall. Also, the quick-reaction soldiers reported fighters wearing Robert's gear and finding \"a helmet with a bullet hole in it, [from which] it was clear the last person [Roberts] to wear it had been shot in the head.\" Predator drone footage analyzed in 2016 with new technology showed Technical Sergeant Chapman was alive and fighting on the peak after being left by the SEALs, rather than being killed outright as thought by Mako 30. Chapman was seen fighting in a bunker against multiple enemies before stepping into the open and braving enemy small arms fire one last time to allow the quick reaction force helicopter a bit of breathing room.\nA paper written by Andrew Milani (Former commander of the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment) and Dr. Stephen D. Biddle entitled \"Pitfalls of Technology: A Case Study of the battle of Takur Ghar\" noted that the Predator was on station 90 minutes after Roberts had fallen; the images that were shot before the Predator had arrived were shot by GRIM-32's Infrared Cameras. although this has not been confirmed by commanders.\n5 March 2002.\nThe last remaining AFO team in the Shah-i-Kot Valley was Team Juliet. They investigated a cave and building complex at the eastern end of the pass. The area had been targeted by multiple air strikes, including a thermobaric bomb that had destroyed the cave on the day of the operation's start. Team Juliet used their ATVs to conduct a passage of lines with the TF Rakkasan elements. They then boarded their Chinook and flew back to Gardez, meaning that every AFO team had now left the valley.\nPlans were put in motion to bring in fresh troops for the clearing of the Shah-i-Kot valley, such as troops of the 4th Battalion, 31st Infantry Regiment and allied Canadian troops. However, there was very little fighting after the events at Takur Ghar, and the U.S. commanders simply chose to take a passive approach and allow the surrounding fires to eliminate the enemy forces.\n10 March 2002.\nMajor Bryan Hilferty stated that the \"major battle ended three or four days ago.\" The U.S. sent 400 of its troops back to base. Efforts were organized to convene the Afghan warlords Zia Lodin and Gul Haidar. Their collaboration aimed to formulate a final offensive to sweep the valley floor and rid the villages of any remaining Al-Qaeda presence. Mark Rosengard maintained his belief in nurturing a sense of ownership and pride among the Afghans. He emphasized that the Afghans themselves needed to lead the operation to clear the villages, ensuring their active involvement in the process. Attempting to facilitate cooperation between Zia Lodin and Gul Haidar posed significant challenges. It was evident that there existed a history between these two men, marked by a lack of mutual trust, although the exact details remained elusive to the Americans. Zia Lodin, a Pashtun commander, held distinct differences from Gul Haidar, a Tajik from Logar Province, who served as the Afghan defense minister and had a background with the Northern Alliance.\nThe primary point of contention between these two men was the order in which they would enter the valley. Both were wary that being the first to advance would leave them with their back turned towards the other, who might potentially take advantage of the situation and shoot them from behind. This disagreement stemmed from their mutual distrust and added complexity to their collaboration efforts. Nevertheless, the Americans ultimately succeeded in convincing the warlords to cooperate and sweep into the valley on March 12.\n12 March 2002.\nThe Afghan troops finally initiated their belated sweep into the valley using a pincer-style attack. A significant aspect of this operation was Gul Haidar's inclusion of a column of T-55 tanks. The U.S. military leadership believed these tanks could play a crucial role in this final operation, despite intelligence suggesting that it was unlikely that any enemy combatants remained in the valley. The American troops accompanying Gul Haidar's forces were impressed by his leadership qualities. An illustrative example of this was when his tank column encountered several antitank mines partially buried along the path. Gul Haidar took charge of the situation and personally used a grabbing hook to secure the mines. This garnered both respect and concern from the Americans, who were worried about the commander's safety. The only issue happened at one point when Haidar's tanks mistakenly fired upon the Rakkasan troops positioned on the mountainside. A T-55 tank crew accidentally fired a main gun round that went right through a pup tent belonging to 2-187 Infantry. Fortunately, no one was injured, and swift radio communication corrected the error.\nMeanwhile, Zia Lodin's forces, accompanied by Pete Blaber himself, were engaged in clearing the valley's southern end. This time, the Afghan troops had the freedom to conduct the operation according to their own strategies, and this made a big difference. Blaber noted that the Afghan troops were highly motivated because they were actually using their own tactics this time. By this point, the operation was nearing its conclusion, with no combat taking place after Takur Ghar except for a minor engagement on March 17. Zia's troops continued to clear the deserted villages within the valley, but there was minimal sign of either civilians or enemy combatants. The operation officially continued for a few more days but during this time, the focus shifted to counting bodies and verifying enemy casualties rather than encountering further fighting.\n13 March 2002.\nThe Rakkasans were replaced by fresh elements from the 10th Mountain Division, who continued to clear the southern end of the Shah-i-Kot. AFO teams launched further Recce teams into the nearby Naka Valley, hunting for al-Qaeda terrorists that had escaped but did not find anything. By this day, following heavy bombing by U.S. strike fighter aircraft, joint U.S. and Afghan forces swept through the valley and cleared it of remaining rebel forces, with little significant combat by 18 March. A total of 8 U.S. soldiers, sailors, and airmen were killed and 82 wounded, along with several Afghan militiamen; U.S. estimates of other casualties vary, indicating rebel casualties between 500 and 800 and at least 14 civilian casualties. An undetermined number of rebels are said to have escaped the fighting through rugged terrain.\n17 March 2002.\nTask Force 11 received time-sensitive intelligence that a possible high-value target was traveling within a convoy of al-Qaeda fighters who were attempting to escape by vehicle from Shah-i-Kot into Pakistan. A Predator UAV had the convoy under surveillance, showing 3 SUVs, a pickup truck, and a large security element of gunmen. The TF 11 element assigned to the mission included SEAL operators from DEVGRU (commanded by the SEAL who led the Mako 30 mission on Takur Ghar) and attached British SBS operators, with a mixed force of Rangers as back up. The operators and an assigned CSAR team boarded 3 MH-47Es while the Rangers climbed aboard a pair of MH-60G Blackhawks, launching from Bagram in the early morning. The MH-47Es carrying the SEALs caught up to their targets: the lead Chinook landed in front of the convoy; as the occupants leapt out of their vehicles, the door gunner hosed the vehicles down with his minigun, cutting down a number of al-Qaeda terrorists; the second Chinook overshot the column and raked it with minigun fire as it passed. The TF 11 operators added their firepower. Two Chinooks then landed their passengers in cover nearby and the operators took up positions overlooking the convoy. Both teams of SEAL operators now opened fire down on the enemy fighters in a crossfire and the third Chinook landed its operators nearby to investigate a suspicious looking vehicle. The firefight was over in minutes; of the 18 al-Qaeda fighters, 16 were killed and two were wounded. The fighters were a mix of well equipped Uzbeks, Chechens, and Arabs. The operators recovered a lot of US military equipment: a US-made suppressor, a number of US fragmentation grenades issued to TF 11 and a Garmin handheld GPS, later traced to the crew of Razor 01.\n18 March 2002.\nGeneral Tommy Franks declared Operation Anaconda over, later describing it \"an unqualified and complete success.\" Investigative reporter Seymour Hersh refuted the official account, describing it as \"in fact a debacle, plagued by squabbling between the services, bad military planning and avoidable deaths of American soldiers, as well as the escape of key al-Qaeda leaders, likely including Osama bin Laden.\"\nAssessment.\nAt the end of Operation Anaconda, the US and Afghan forces had succeeded at removing the majority of the Al-Qaeda and Taliban presence from the Shah-i-Kot Valley. The US forces suffered 80 casualties in the operation, with 8 killed and 72 wounded. An undetermined number of Afghan fighters were also killed in the Operation Anaconda. Estimates of Al-Qaeda and Taliban casualties range from 100 to 1,000, with U.S. commanders favoring the higher estimates and Afghan commanders favoring the lower estimates. The U.S. forces estimated they had killed at least 500 fighters over the duration of the battle, however, journalists later noted that only 23 bodies were found \u2013 and critics suggested that after a couple of days, the operation \"was more driven by media obsession, than military necessity\".\nSecurity expert Bill Roggio argued that al-Qaeda \"took a beating during the battle, [but] they were by no means defeated\".\nA significant critique of Operation Anaconda centered around the lack of air support that the Rakkasan troops relied upon. General Hagenbeck expressed frustration about the delays in getting requested airstrikes when needed. He highlighted in an interview with \"Field Artillery\" magazine in September 2002 that there were instances where it took anywhere from twenty-six minutes to several hours for the requested air strikes to actually arrive. This meant that the Infantry positioned in the Halfpipe had to endure extended periods of time lying in the dirt, exposed to enemy fire, without the necessary air cover. While air support proved crucial in assisting the Infantry during the operation, often responding quickly and neutralizing insurgent mortar positions and machine-gun nests as requested, there were other instances in which the air support team failed to adequately assist the ground forces.\nOperation Anaconda was also met with criticism from allied coalition forces. According to an interview of some soldiers of the German Special Forces KSK, the post-operation briefing was broken down by an argument between the KSK soldiers and U.S. soldiers. The cause of the conflict is said to have been the complaint of some U.S. soldiers that the KSK soldiers had only changed their position when a shepherd stumbled into their hideout instead of killing him. \"Use your silenced gun, then move on.\"\n\"\"The U.S. soldiers would in fact eliminate such 'threats,' says a former KSK officer. (...) The Germans are quoted to have witnessed U.S. Forces flattening entire villages during Operation Anaconda: 'Let's go, free to pillage' (...). A former KSK commander is quoted in the German magazine \"Stern\" to have said: 'The pictures of Abu Ghraib, the torture in Iraqi prison camps, did absolutely not surprise me.\"'\nIn the wake of Operation Anaconda, relations between US and UK forces on the ground soured when \"Stars and Stripes,\" the magazine for American forces and their families, openly criticized the Royal Marines for returning \"empty-handed\" from their search for al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters claiming that Britain's contribution to the campaign was \"disappointing.\" Relations were further soured with reports from a number of publications that Osama bin Laden might have escaped due to a substantial delay from the original H-hour of the deployment of American Forces.\nStephen Biddle has characterized Operation Anaconda as a \"series of surprisingly orthodox ground battles.\" He rejects the popular characterization of the operation as a guerilla war.\nLong-distance sniper record.\nThe record for the longest combat kill by a sniper was during Operation Anaconda by the Canadian Army sniper Corporal Rob Furlong of the 3rd Battalion Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry and held for seven years until it was surpassed in 2009. Using a McMillan TAC-50 .50-calibre rifle, Furlong killed a Taliban fighter armed with an RPK machine gun at a confirmed distance of 2,430 meters (1.51 miles). A few days prior to Furlong's shot, his teammate, Arron Perry, also from the 3rd Battalion PPCLI, had set the previous record of , meaning that a new record was achieved twice during the operation.\nThe five-man team, including MCpl Graham Ragsdale, MCpl Tim McMeekin, MCpl Arron Perry, Cpl Dennis Eason, and Cpl Rob Furlong, killed over 20 enemy fighters during the operation and were awarded Bronze Star medals by the United States for their service.\nAftermath.\nAfter defeating Taliban and Al-Qaeda forces in the Shah-i-Kot valley, coalition forces launched a series of follow-up operations codenamed \"Operation Jacana\" starting April 16. These operations aimed to tackle insurgents who were expected to regroup and launch guerrilla attacks in surrounding areas. The British Defense Secretary, Geoff Hoon, announced the largest deployment of British combat forces since the Gulf War in 1991. Around 1,700 Royal Marines, including troops from the 45 Commando battalion, were sent to Afghanistan for these planned operations. Franks and Hagenbeck anticipated many more battles ahead, stating that there were \u2018thousands of enemies [still] out there\u2019. In fact, this assumption turned out to be completely false, and Operation Anaconda became the last major battle in Afghanistan for the next several years. This led many Royal Marines to complain that they had been deployed \"a month too late\", as the combat action that they had anticipated did not materialize.\nThe 10th Mountain Division carried out intelligence-driven operations to locate any remaining Al-Qaeda and Taliban insurgents but did not find much, as it appeared that the jihadists had either escaped to Pakistan or gone into hiding in remote areas of Afghanistan. A large proportion of the US forces found themselves in a state of waiting, eager to act, but with no immediate tasks at hand. The troops of the Royal Canadian Infantry Corps found themselves in a similar situation, spending only 5 out of 120 days actively engaged in operations outside their bases. By July the tactical-level units from the 10th Mountain Division and the 101st Airborne Division, including TF Rakkasan, had all\ndeparted Afghanistan; the CTF Mountain headquarters staff followed in early September. They were replaced by CTF 82, formed from the headquarters of the 82d Airborne Division and led by the division's commander, Major General John R. Vines. CTF 82's headquarters was at Bagram Airfield, and Vines-based TF Panther, his primary maneuver element, at the Kandahar Airfield. TF Panther was under the command of Colonel James L. Huggins and had two infantry battalions from the 3d Brigade of the 82d Airborne Division and one attached infantry battalion from the division's 1st Brigade. Huggins also had support from artillery, aviation, military intelligence, and other units. TF Panther deployed to Afghanistan in late June 2002 and would serve under CTF 82 until 5 December 2002. At that point TF Devil, a unit formed around the 1st Brigade, 82d Airborne Division arrived to take the lead in tactical-level security operations.\nThe Taliban subsequently portrayed the operation as a \"historical battle\" and a \"beginning of the sacred jihad against the occupation of Afghanistan\", praising Saif-ur-Rehman Mansoor's leadership. The battle and Mansoor (who was killed in 2008) were eulogized by the Taliban's official website, \"Voice of Jihad\", on 7 March 2021.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Henry\n\"The Gift of the Magi\" is a short story by American writer O. Henry, first published in 1905. The story tells of a young husband and wife and how they deal with the challenge of buying secret Christmas gifts for each other with very little money. As a sentimental story with a moral lesson about gift-giving, it has been popular for adaptation, especially for presentation at Christmas time. The plot and its twist ending are well known; the ending is generally considered an example of cosmic irony. The story was allegedly written at Pete's Tavern on Irving Place in New York City.\nThe story was initially published in \"The New York Sunday World\" under the title \"Gifts of the Magi\" on December 10, 1905. It was first published in book form in the O. Henry collection \"The Four Million\" in April 1906.\nPlot.\nOn Christmas Eve, a young woman named Della Dillingham Young discovers that she has only $1.87 to buy a present for her husband James, also known as Jim. Despite being poor, the Dillingham Youngs love each other and possess two items they value as treasures: Della's knee-length brown hair that would depreciate the Queen of Sheba's jewels, and Jim's gold pocket watch, a family heirloom that would make King Solomon envy him.\nDella dresses warmly and visits the nearby shop of a wig maker, Madame Sofronie, who buys Della's hair for $20. Della then uses the money to buy a platinum fob chain to go with Jim's watch, which he has attached with a worn leather strap. When Jim comes home from work that evening, Della admits that she sold her hair to buy him the chain. Jim gives Della her present, a set of ornamental combs, which she cannot use until her hair grows back out. Della gives Jim the watch chain, and he tells her that he sold his watch to buy the combs. While they know the gifts they gave each other cannot be used for a while, Jim and Della realize how far they went to show each other their love and how invaluable it truly is. The story ends with the narrator declaring that those who sacrifice their material possessions for the people they love are as wise as the magi.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Henry", "text": "American writer (1862\u20131910)\nWilliam Sydney Porter (September 11, 1862 \u2013 June 5, 1910), better known by his pen name O. Henry, was an American writer known primarily for his short stories, though he also wrote poetry and non-fiction. His works include \"The Gift of the Magi\", \"The Duplicity of Hargraves\", and \"The Ransom of Red Chief\", as well as the novel \"Cabbages and Kings\". Porter's stories are known for their naturalist observations, witty narration, and surprise endings.\nBorn in Greensboro, North Carolina, Porter worked at his uncle's pharmacy after finishing school and became a licensed pharmacist at age 19. In March 1882, he moved to Texas, where he initially lived on a ranch, and later settled in Austin, where he met his first wife, Athol Estes. While working as a drafter for the Texas General Land Office, Porter began developing characters for his short stories. He later worked for the First National Bank of Austin, while also publishing a weekly periodical, \"The Rolling Stone\".\nIn 1895, he was charged with embezzlement stemming from an audit of the bank. Before the trial, he fled to Honduras, where he began writing \"Cabbages and Kings\" (in which he coined the term \"banana republic\"). Porter surrendered to U.S. authorities when he learned his wife was dying from tuberculosis, and he cared for her until her death in July 1897. He began his five-year prison sentence in March 1898 at the Ohio Penitentiary, where he served as a night druggist. While imprisoned, Porter published 14 stories under various pseudonyms, one being O. Henry.\nReleased from prison early for good behavior, Porter moved to Pittsburgh to be with his daughter Margaret before relocating to New York City, where he wrote 381 short stories. He married Sarah (Sallie) Lindsey Coleman in 1907; she left him two years later. Porter died on June 5, 1910, after years of deteriorating health. Porter's legacy includes the O. Henry Award, an annual prize awarded to outstanding short stories.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nWilliam Sidney Porter was born on September 11, 1862, in Greensboro, North Carolina, during the American Civil War. He changed the spelling of his middle name to Sydney in 1898. His parents were Algernon Sidney Porter (1825\u201388), a physician, and Mary Jane Virginia Swaim Porter (1833\u201365). William's parents had married on April 20, 1858. When William was three, his mother died after giving birth to her third child, and he and his father moved into the home of his paternal grandmother. As a child, Porter was always reading, everything from classics to dime novels; his favorite works were Lane's translation of \"One Thousand and One Nights\" and Burton's \"The Anatomy of Melancholy\".\nPorter graduated from his aunt Evelina Maria Porter's elementary school in 1876. He then enrolled at the Lindsey Street High School. His aunt continued to tutor him until he was 15. In 1879, he started working in his uncle's drugstore in Greensboro, and on August 30, 1881, at the age of 19, Porter was licensed as a pharmacist. At the drugstore, he also showed his natural artistic talents by sketching the townsfolk.\nLife in Texas.\nPorter traveled along with James K. Hall to Texas in March 1882, hoping that a change of air would help alleviate a persistent cough he had developed. He took up residence on the sheep ranch of Richard Hall, James Hall's son, in La Salle County and helped out as a shepherd, ranch hand, cook, and baby-sitter. While on the ranch, he learned bits of Spanish and German from the mix of indigenous and immigrant ranch hands. He also spent time reading classic works of literature.\nPorter's health did improve. He traveled with Richard to Austin, Texas, in 1884, where he decided to remain and was welcomed into the home of Richard's friends, Joseph Harrell, and his wife. Porter resided with the Harrells for three years. He went to work briefly for the Morley Brothers Drug Company as a pharmacist. Porter then moved on to work for the Harrell Cigar Store located in the Driskill Hotel. He also began writing as a sideline and wrote many of his early stories in the Harrell house.\nAs a young bachelor, Porter led an active social life in Austin. He was known for his wit, story-telling, and musical talents. He played both the guitar and mandolin. He sang in the choir at St. David's Episcopal Church and became a member of the \"Hill City Quartette\", a group of young men who sang at gatherings and serenaded young women of the town.\nPorter met and began courting Athol Estes, 17 years old and from a wealthy family. Historians believe Porter met Athol at the laying of the cornerstone of the Texas State Capitol on March 2, 1885. Her mother objected to the match because Athol was ill, suffering from tuberculosis. On July 1, 1887, Porter eloped with Athol and they were married in the parlor of the home of the Reverend R. K. Smoot, pastor of the Central Presbyterian Church, where the Estes family attended church. The couple continued to participate in musical and theater groups, and Athol encouraged her husband to pursue his writing. Athol gave birth to a son in 1888, who died hours after birth, and then a daughter Margaret Worth Porter in September 1889.\nPorter's friend Richard Hall became Texas Land Commissioner and offered Porter a job. Porter started as a draftsman at the Texas General Land Office (GLO) on January 12, 1887, at a salary of $100 a month, drawing maps from surveys and field notes. The salary was enough to support his family, but he continued his contributions to magazines and newspapers. In the GLO building, he began developing characters and plots for such stories as \"Georgia's Ruling\" (1900), and \"Buried Treasure\" (1908). The castle-like building he worked in was woven into some of his tales such as \"Bexar Scrip No. 2692\" (1894). His job at the GLO was a political appointment by Hall. Hall ran for governor in the election of 1890 but lost. Porter resigned on January 21, 1891, the day after the new governor, Jim Hogg, was sworn in.\nThe same year, Porter began working at the First National Bank of Austin as a teller and bookkeeper at the same salary he had made at the GLO. The bank was operated informally, and Porter was apparently careless in keeping his books and may have embezzled funds. In 1894, he was accused by the bank of embezzlement and lost his job but was not indicted at the time.\nHe then worked full-time on his humorous weekly called \"The Rolling Stone\", which he started while working at the bank. \"The Rolling Stone\" featured satire on life, people, and politics and included Porter's short stories and sketches. Although eventually reaching a top circulation of 1,500, \"The Rolling Stone\" failed in April 1895 because the paper never provided an adequate income. However, his writing and drawings had caught the attention of the editor at the \"Houston Post\".\nPorter and his family moved to Houston in 1895, where he started writing for the \"Post\". His salary was only $25 a month, but it rose steadily as his popularity increased. Porter gathered ideas for his column by loitering in hotel lobbies and observing and talking to people there. This was a technique he used throughout his writing career.\nWhile he was in Houston, federal auditors audited the First National Bank of Austin and found the embezzlement shortages that led to his firing. A federal indictment followed, and he was arrested on charges of embezzlement.\nFlight and return.\nAfter his arrest, Porter's father-in-law posted his bail. He was due to stand trial on July 7, 1896, but the day before, as he was changing trains to get to the courthouse, he got scared. He fled, first to New Orleans and later to Honduras, with which the United States had no extradition treaty at that time. Porter lived in Honduras for six months, until January 1897. There he became friends with Al Jennings, a notorious train robber, who later wrote a book about their friendship. He holed up in a Trujillo hotel, where he wrote \"Cabbages and Kings\", which notably coined the term \"banana republic\". Porter had sent Athol and Margaret back to Austin to live with Athol's parents. Unfortunately, Athol became too ill to meet Porter in Honduras as he had planned. When he learned that his wife was dying, Porter returned to Austin in February 1897 and surrendered to the court, pending trial. Athol Estes Porter died from tuberculosis (then known as consumption) on July 25, 1897.\nPorter had little to say in his own defense at his trial and was found guilty on February 17, 1898, of embezzling $854.08. He was sentenced to five years in prison and imprisoned on March 25, 1898, at the Ohio Penitentiary in Columbus, Ohio. Porter was a licensed pharmacist and was able to work in the prison hospital as the night druggist. He was given his own room in the hospital wing, and there is no record that he actually spent time in the cell block of the prison. He had 14 stories published under various pseudonyms while he was in prison but was becoming best known as \"O. Henry\", a pseudonym that first appeared over the story \"Whistling Dick's Christmas Stocking\" in the December 1899 issue of \"McClure's Magazine\". A friend of his in New Orleans would forward his stories to publishers so that they had no idea that the writer was imprisoned.\nPorter was released on July 24, 1901, for good behavior after serving three years. He reunited with his daughter Margaret, now age 11, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where Athol's parents had moved after Porter's conviction.\nLater life.\nPorter's most prolific writing period started in 1902, when he moved to New York City to be near his publishers. While there, he wrote 381 short stories. He wrote a story a week for over a year for the \"New York World Sunday Magazine\". His wit, characterization, and plot twists were adored by his readers but often panned by critics.\nPorter married again in 1907 to childhood sweetheart Sarah (Sallie) Lindsey Coleman, whom he met again after revisiting his native state of North Carolina. Coleman was herself a writer and wrote a romanticized and fictionalized version of their correspondence and courtship in her novella \"Wind of Destiny\".\nDeath.\nPorter was a heavy drinker, and by 1908, his markedly deteriorating health affected his writing. In 1909, Sarah left him, and he died on June 5, 1910, of cirrhosis of the liver, complications of diabetes, and an enlarged heart. According to one account, he died of cerebral hemorrhage.\nAfter funeral services in New York City, he was buried in the Riverside Cemetery in Asheville, North Carolina. His daughter Margaret Worth Porter had a short writing career from 1913 to 1916. She married cartoonist Oscar Cesare of New York in 1916; they were divorced four years later. She died of tuberculosis in 1927 and was buried next to her father.\nAccording to the cemetery, as of 2023, people have been leaving $1.87 in change (the amount of Della's savings at the beginning of \"The Gift of the Magi\") on Porter's grave for at least 30 years. The cemetery says the money is given to area libraries.\nStories.\nMost of Porter's stories are set in his own time, the early 20th century. He had an obvious affection for New York City, which he called \"Bagdad-on-the-Subway\", and many of his stories are set there, while others are set in small towns or in other cities. They frequently feature working class characters, such as policemen and waitresses, as well as criminals and social outcasts. In his day he was called the American answer to French naturalist Guy de Maupassant, whose work was similarly concerned with the struggles of common people and often had twist endings.\n\"Cabbages and Kings\" was his first collection of stories, followed by \"The Four Million\". The second collection opens with a reference to Ward McAllister's claim that there were \"...only 'Four Hundred' people in New York City who were really worth noticing. But a wiser man has arisen\u2014the census taker\u2014and his larger estimate of human interest has been preferred in marking out the field of these little stories of the Four Million.\"\nHis final work was \"Dream\", a short story intended for the magazine \"The Cosmopolitan\". It was never completed.\nAmong his most famous stories are:\nPen name.\nPorter used a number of pen names (including \"O. Henry\" or \"Olivier Henry\") in the early part of his writing career; other names included S.H. Peters, James L. Bliss, T.B. Dowd, and Howard Clark. Nevertheless, the name \"O. Henry\" seemed to garner the most attention from editors and the public, and was used exclusively by Porter for his writing by about 1902. He gave various explanations for the origin of his pen name. In 1909, he gave an interview to \"The New York Times\", in which he gave an account of it:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It was during these New Orleans days that I adopted my pen name of O. Henry. I said to a friend: \"I'm going to send out some stuff. I don't know if it amounts to much, so I want to get a literary alias. Help me pick out a good one.\" He suggested that we get a newspaper and pick a name from the first list of notables that we found in it. In the society columns we found the account of a fashionable ball. \"Here we have our notables,\" said he. We looked down the list and my eye lighted on the name Henry, \"That'll do for a last name,\" said I. \"Now for a first name. I want something short. None of your three-syllable names for me.\" \"Why don't you use a plain initial letter, then?\" asked my friend. \"Good,\" said I, \"O is about the easiest letter written, and O it is.\"\nA newspaper once wrote and asked me what the O stands for. I replied, \"O stands for Olivier, the French for Oliver.\" And several of my stories accordingly appeared in that paper under the name Olivier Henry.\nWilliam Trevor writes in the introduction to \"The World of O. Henry: Roads of Destiny and Other Stories\" (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 1973) that \"there was a prison guard named Orrin Henry\" in the Ohio State Penitentiary \"whom William Sydney Porter ... immortalised as O. Henry\".\nAccording to J. F. Clarke, it is from the name of the French pharmacist Etienne Ossian Henry, whose name is in the \"U.S. Dispensary\" which Porter used working in the prison pharmacy.\nWriter and scholar Guy Davenport offers his own hypothesis: \"The pseudonym that he began to write under in prison is constructed from the first two letters of \"Ohio\" and the second and last two of \"penitentiary\".\"\nLegacy.\nThe O. Henry Award is an annual prize named after Porter and given to outstanding short stories.\nA film was made in 1952 featuring five stories, called \"O. Henry's Full House\". The episode garnering the most critical acclaim was \"The Cop and the Anthem\" starring Charles Laughton and Marilyn Monroe. The other stories are \"The Clarion Call\", \"The Last Leaf\", \"The Ransom of Red Chief\", and \"The Gift of the Magi\".\n\"Strictly Business\" is a 1962 Soviet comedy film, directed by Leonid Gaidai, based on three short stories by O. Henry: \"The Roads We Take\", \"Makes the Whole World Kin\", and \"The Ransom of Red Chief\". The premiere of the film was timed to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the birth of the writer. Henry was particularly popular in Russia in the 1920s, and was described by the critic Deming Brown in 1953 as \"remain[ing] a minor classic in Russia\". In 1962, the Soviet Postal Service issued a stamp commemorating O. Henry's 100th birthday.\nA 1957 television series, \"The O. Henry Playhouse\", was syndicated in 39 episodes to 188 markets. Actor Thomas Mitchell portrayed O. Henry in each episode as he interacted with his characters or related his latest story to his publisher or a friend.\nThe 1986 Indian anthology television series \"Katha Sagar\" adapted several of Henry's short stories as episodes including \"The Last Leaf\".\nAn opera in one long act, \"The Furnished Room\", with music by Daniel Steven Crafts and libretto by Richard Kuss, is based on O. Henry's story of the same name.\nThe O. Henry House and O. Henry Hall, both in Austin, Texas, are named for him. O. Henry Hall, now owned by the Texas State University System, previously served as the federal courthouse in which O. Henry was convicted of embezzlement. The O. Henry House has been the site of the O. Henry Pun-Off, an annual spoken word competition inspired by Porter's love of language, since 1978. (Dr. Samuel E. Gideon, a historical architect and professor at the University of Texas at Austin, was a strong advocate for the saving of the O. Henry House in Austin.)\nSeveral schools are named for Porter: William Sydney Porter Elementary in Greensboro, North Carolina, O. Henry Elementary in Garland, Texas, the O. Henry School (I.S. 70) in New York City, and O. Henry Middle School in Austin, Texas.\nThe O. Henry Hotel in Greensboro is also named for Porter, as is US 29, which is O. Henry Boulevard.\nAsheville, North Carolina, where Porter is buried, has O. Henry Avenue, the location of the \"Asheville Citizen-Times\" building.\nOn September 11, 2012, the United States Postal Service issued a stamp commemorating the 150th anniversary of O. Henry's birth.\nOn November 23, 2011, Barack Obama quoted O. Henry while granting pardons to two turkeys named \"Liberty\" and \"Peace\". In response, political science professor P. S. Ruckman Jr. and Texas attorney Scott Henson filed a formal application for a posthumous pardon in September 2012, the same month that the U.S. Postal Service issued its O. Henry stamp. Previous attempts were made to obtain such a pardon for Porter in the administrations of Woodrow Wilson, Dwight Eisenhower, and Ronald Reagan, but no one had ever bothered to file a formal application. Ruckman and Henson argued that Porter deserved a pardon because (1) he was a law-abiding citizen prior to his conviction; (2) his offense was minor; (3) he had an exemplary prison record; (4) his post-prison life clearly indicated rehabilitation; (5) he would have been an excellent candidate for clemency in his time, had he but applied for pardon; (6) by today's standards, he remains an excellent candidate for clemency; and (7) his pardon would be a well-deserved symbolic gesture and more. The pardon remains ungranted.\nIn 2021 the Library of America included O. Henry in their list by publishing a collection of 101 of his stories, edited by Ben Yagoda.\nBibliography.\nStories.\nCollections:\nUncollected short stories:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPoems.\nUncollected poems:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNon-fiction.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nhttps://\nhttps:// in \"O.

The show stars already-established Marvel Comics characters Spider-Man and Iceman, along with an original character, Firestar. As a trio called the Spider-Friends, they fight against various villains of the Marvel Universe.\nProduction.\nThe series was an attempt by NBC to replicate some of the success ABC enjoyed with the \"Super Friends\" franchise. The makers of the show intended the stars to be Spider-Man, Iceman, and the Human Torch. However, legal issues about the rights to the Human Torch character (which had also plagued Marvel once before for the 1978 \"Fantastic Four\" cartoon) led to the Human Torch being replaced by a new character, Firestar, who had similar powers, but was a mutant like Iceman. Due to Firestar's popularity with fans, she has since become a part of the mainstream Marvel Universe. In pre-production, Firestar's codename changed frequently; the unused names include Firefly, Starblaze, and Heatwave.\nMarvel Comics maintained a high level of creative control over the series, with Stan Lee (co-creator of both Spider-Man and Iceman) working with the screenwriters and involving himself in the casting and animation.\nSome of the sound effects used in the series originated from Universal Television's \"Battlestar Galactica\" and \"Buck Rogers in the 25th Century\". Adding Ms. Lion, a pet, as a character was another attempt to emulate the \"Super Friends\" (specifically the characters Wonder Dog and Gleek).\nFirestar actress Kathy Garver recalled that though the storyboards for each episode were completed before the voices were recorded for it, \"... we really just worked from script. We'd do a roundtable to get the feeling of how the show was going, and then we would record\".\nBroadcast schedule.\nOriginally broadcast on NBC as a Saturday morning cartoon, the series ran first-run original episodes for three seasons, from 1981 to 1983, then aired repeats for an additional two years (from 1984 to 1986). Alongside the 1981 \"Spider-Man\" animated series, \"Amazing Friends\" was later re-aired in the late 1980s as part of the 90-minute \"Marvel Action Universe\", a syndicated series that was used as a platform for old and new Marvel-produced animated fare (the newer programming featured ', \"Dino-Riders\" and on occasion ', which was a pilot for a potential X-Men animated series). Mihahn and Toei Animation contributed some of the animation for this series.\nSeason changes.\nDuring the first season, each episode contained a cold open, which was and remains unusual for a children's cartoon. When the same episodes were re-aired later in the series' run, these teaser sequences were edited to fit after the titles and episode card. Still, the original sequence infrequently showed up on NBC's re-airings. Stan Lee did not originally narrate the episodes from this season.\nIn the second season, the show aired along with a newly produced Hulk animated series as The Incredible Hulk and the Amazing Spider-Man. The two shows shared one intro which showcased the new title. In place of the cold opens from the first season, Marvel Productions created 12-second previews aired immediately preceding the episodes. Stan Lee began narrating the episodes in the second season. Marvel Productions also added narrations by Lee to the first-season episodes at this time to give the series cohesion. Neither first nor second season narrations appear on the current masters, and they have not aired since the NBC airings (as seen on the Stan Lee narration list at Spider-Friends.com).\nFor the third season, the characters' billing was reversed and the show was called, The Amazing Spider-Man and the Incredible Hulk. It remained that way for most of the remaining years. NBC did air the show individually in mid-season (post 1986) after it was not initially announced for their fall schedule. Only some of the Stan Lee narrations for the third season are on the current masters. The missing narrations have not aired since the NBC airings.\nStoryline.\nPeter Parker (Spider-Man), Bobby Drake (Iceman), and Angelica Jones (Firestar) are all college students at Empire State University. After working together to defeat the Beetle and recovering the \"Power Booster\" he stole from Tony Stark (a.k.a. Iron Man) the trio decide to team-up permanently as the \"Spider-Friends\". They live together at Aunt May's home with her pet dog named Ms. Lion, a Lhasa Apso who was adopted by Firestar. Together, the superheroes battle various supervillains.\nSome stories featured team-ups with other superheroes including but not limited to Captain America, Doctor Strange, Thor, Sunfire, and the mid-1970s X-Men.\nCharacters.\nOriginal characters.\nA number of characters in the series were original characters that did not appear in the comics prior to the premiere of the series:\nFirestar.\nOne of the series' main characters, Firestar was created specifically for this series when the Human Torch was unavailable (due to licensing issues). The original plan was for Spider-Man to have fire and ice based teammates, so Angelica Jones/Firestar was created. Her pre-production names included \"Heatwave\", \"Firefly\", (both having already been names of DC Comics villains) and \"Starblaze\".\nFirestar did not appear in Marvel's mainstream comic book universe until \"Uncanny X-Men\" #193 (May 1985). She appears as a member of the Hellions, a group of teenage mutants who functioned as rivals to the New Mutants (a similar group under the tutelage of Charles Xavier). After leaving the Hellions, Firestar becomes a founding member of the New Warriors and later serves as a distinguished member of the Avengers along with her fellow New Warrior, Justice. She is currently a member of the X-Men.\nHiawatha Smith.\nHiawatha Smith is a college professor at the Spider-Friends' university. He is the son of a heroic Native American chief who fought against the Axis during World War II.\nHiawatha Smith's home is adorned with decorations from various cultures including Hindu and native African tribes. Producer and story editor Dennis Marks created the character and admits to basing him on Indiana Jones.\nSmith's father passed down to his son the mystic knowledge of their people and a map leading to a vast Nazi treasure of wealth and advanced technology sought by the Red Skull. Smith often employs a boomerang in battle. He possesses a supernatural ability to communicate with animals.\nLightwave.\nLightwave's real name is Aurora Dante. Like her older half-brother Bobby Drake (a.k.a. the superhero Iceman), Lightwave is a mutant. She can manipulate and control light. Her other light-based powers include laser blasts, photonic force fields and solid light pressor beams. She can also transform herself into light; in such a form, she is able to exist in the vacuum of outer space.\nLightwave's only appearance was in \"Save the Guardstar\", the final episode of the 1980s cartoon. She is voiced by Annie Lockhart. Bobby Drake explains that they share the same mother.\nAn agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., Lightwave is considered a traitor, due to mind control by rogue S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Buzz Mason. Mason induces Lightwave to steal assorted devices to create a \"quantum enhancer\" which would increase her powers 1,000 times. With such power, Lightwave would be able to control the Guardstar satellite which orbits the Earth and controls all defense systems and communications systems for the United States. Mason expects world conquest since he controls Lightwave.\nIceman, Firestar, and Spider-Man attempt to stop Lightwave. However, she is powerful enough to defeat them. Aboard a space vessel, Buzz Mason forces Iceman into outer space, dooming Iceman if he remains there for long. Spider-Man convinces Lightwave to realize that the half-brother she loves is in mortal danger. Her reaction breaks Mason's control over her, and she saves Iceman and disables Mason long enough for Spider-Man to subdue him.\nPresumably, with Mason's role realized, S.H.I.E.L.D. restores Lightwave's good standing. As this is Lightwave's only appearance, her fate is unknown.\nVideoman.\nVideoman is an intangible two-dimensional being with lightning bolt-shaped horns that is mostly composed of electronic data gleaned from a video arcade. Videoman makes three appearances in the series where there are two versions of him.\nAs a villain.\nIn Season 1, Videoman first appeared as an angular humanoid energy construct created by Electro. Its abilities include moving through and manipulating electronic circuits and projecting rectangular pulses of energy. Videoman is used by Electro to suck in and entrap Spider-Man, Flash Thompson, Firestar and Iceman into a video game display where Electro attempts to destroy the four. However, Flash is able to save himself and the others by escaping through the monitor and into Electro's electronic components to save the others.\nThis first villainous version of Videoman makes one other appearance in Season 2's \"Origin of Ice-Man\", with the additional abilities of bringing video game characters to life and draining the unique bio-energy of mutants, temporarily suppressing Iceman's powers and weakening Firestar, as well as being able to emulate their powers for its own use. This time, Videoman is defeated when the Spider-Friends trick it and its video game minions into attacking one another.\nAs a superhero.\nIn the Season 3 episode \"The Education of a Superhero\", nerdy Francis Byte is an avid video game player who is especially engrossed into gaining the high score on a game called Zellman Comman at the local arcade. The villain Gamesman sends a hypnotic signal that entrances over 300,000 people in the city. This does not affect Francis' girlfriend Louise, Spider-Man, and Firestar, nor does the signal affect Francis' mind, which is distracted from entrancement by Louise and the game. Louise walks away from Francis, then also gets affected and hypnotized after having her pleas disregarded by Francis. He (unbeknownst to any others) plays the arcade machine so rigorously that it and other arcade machines (most of which are emitting the hypnotic waves) explode. The explosion transforms Francis into Videoman.\nFrancis discovers that he can become his new blue and white, red-eyed alter-ego Videoman at will. However, he is inexperienced with handling such powerful abilities. He tries to help the trio (which has awakened Iceman from his trance) against a hypnotized mob, but they repel his offers due to his inexperience. He then tries to save Louise from the Gamesman, but he is easily blackmailed into manipulating a military communications satellite system in return for Louise's freedom, an offer that is then reneged upon by the Gamesman. Enraged at the trickery, Videoman helps Spider-Man and the others free Louise and also reverses his stoppage of the military computer. After the Gamesman is defeated, Francis accepts an invitation to join the X-Men, while Louise accepts him and his abilities.\nVideoman made a cameo appearance in the 2023 film \"\". He is depicted as a prisoner of Miguel O'Hara's Spider-Society among other universe-displaced villains.\nEpisodes.\nSeason 2 (1982).\nThis season features the origins of all three Spider-Friends.\nRelease.\nHome media.\nNo Region 1 or other NTSC release is planned at this time.\nRegion 2.\nIn April 2008, Liberation Entertainment secured the home media rights to select Marvel shows from Jetix Europe in select European territories, including \"Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends\". On November 10, the company released the first season of the series on DVD followed up with a Series 2-3 set and Complete Series DVD sets on November 24. These releases were distributed through Lace International, due to Liberation closing their UK branch a few weeks prior in October. The Liberation releases did not include any of the Stan Lee narrations from the first or second season. Only some of the Stan Lee narrations were in the third season.\nClear Vision later took over European rights and re-released the series on August 2, 2010 (Season 1) and September 6, 2010 (Seasons 2 and 3) in the United Kingdom respectively, with a German release following afterwards. These newer editions have improved image quality and include German dubbing, while removing the 5.1 audio track and English subtitles. A Complete Series release followed on February 11, 2013.\nBudget distributor Walk released a small number of DVD releases in the United Kingdom containing two episodes each for sale in Poundland stores in 2013, under the \"Treat Size Introduces...\" banner.\nStreaming.\nThe series was available for instant streaming via Netflix from 2011 to August 2015. As part of the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by The Walt Disney Company, the copyrights to the New World library were transferred to TFCF America, Inc., a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company, effective on March 15, 2019. Consequently, the series became available on the Disney+ streaming service, as a part of U.S. launch on November 12, 2019.\nCensorship.\nThe episode \"The Quest of the Red Skull\" was excluded due to its direct depictions of Adolf Hitler, the Nazi swastika and the phrase 'Heil Hitler'. In 2020, Disney+ placed a warning on the 3rd episode (entitled \"Sunfire\") for a racially insensitive portrayal of Sunfire. In the episode, Sunfire is portrayed as speaking English with a Japanese accent.\nReception.\nCritical response.\nAdam Levine of \"Looper\" said: \"The mutant duo became a memorable pairing for Spider-Man, and the series has been fondly remembered in the decades since for its quaint stories, colorful villains, light-hearted nature, and iconic introductions by creator Stan Lee. The animation was a step up from previous attempts, even if it was still relatively simplistic, and stories explored more of Peter Parker's personal life than the 1960s series before it\". James Whitbrook of \"Gizmodo\" ranked 5th in their \"Spider-Man's Best Cartoons\" list, writing: \"The trio had an excellent dynamic that elevated Amazing beyond its sister show, and as campy as it could be, there's a reason why it remains beloved by many\".\nOlivia Fitzpatrick of \"Collider\" ranked \"Spider-Man and His Amazing Friend\" 3rd in their \"Every 'Spider-Man' Animated Series\" list. Jason Serafino of \"Complex\" ranked 25th in their \"25 Best Animated Comic Book TV Shows Of All Time\" list. \"IGN\" ranked \"Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends\" 59th in their \"Top 100 Animated Series\" list, stating that \"the animation was predictably budget for the time, particularly when viewed in this post-\"Spectacular Spider-Man\" world of ours, but it was fun nonetheless\".\nAccolades.\n\"Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends\" was nominated for Best Children's Television Series at the 1982 Young Artist Awards.\nComic books.\nAdaptation.\nThe first comic book that directly referenced the \"Amazing Friends\" show was \"Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends\" #1 (December 1981), a one-shot that adapted the pilot episode, \"The Triumph of the Green Goblin\". Though the comic version altered the story to bring it in line with established Marvel Universe continuity (such as making the Green Goblin identity a costume as in the comics, rather than a physical transformation as in the episode), it was not considered part of Marvel continuity. It is the first appearance of Firestar in a comics story, though the version of Firestar that exists within Marvel continuity did not appear until \"Uncanny X-Men\" #193 (May 1985).\nThe story was reprinted in England in late 1983 in the weekly Marvel UK title \"Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends\". It was reprinted in the U.S. as \"Marvel Action Universe\" #1 (January 1989), released to coincide with the airing of \"Amazing Friends\" reruns on the television series of the same name and on the 2017 trade paperback \"X-Men Origins: Firestar\".\nIn the Marvel mainstream continuity, Spider-Man, Firestar and Iceman have made sporadic team-ups in \"Amazing X-Men\" #7 (July 2014) and \"Iceman\" #3 (November 2018).\nFirestar.\nThe mainstream Marvel Universe version of Firestar debuted in the pages of \"Uncanny X-Men\" #193 as part of Emma Frost's Hellions team. Firestar was given an origin story in a self-titled mini-series (March \u2013 June 1986). The character went on to be a founding member of the New Warriors, and later a member of the Avengers.\nOne change to Firestar from the TV show to the comic books was her powers. In the cartoon, they were fire based. However, Marvel had a number of characters who could control and/or create fire, so they changed her mutant ability to the power to emit and control microwave energy.\n\"Amazing Friends\" 2006.\nTo commemorate the 25th anniversary of the show, Marvel released \"Spider-Man Family: Amazing Friends\" #1 on August 9, 2006. The comic starts with an all-new story, \"Opposites Attack\", which is officially set before \"Web of Spider-Man\" #75. After that is a Mini Marvel tale, \"Spider-Man And His Amazing &lt;del&gt;Friends&lt;/del&gt; Co-Workers\" (note that the strikethrough of \"Friends\" was a deliberate inclusion in the title). Both stories were written by Sean McKeever.\nThe remainder of the one-shot is composed of reprints of \"Untold Tales of Spider-Man\" #2 and \"Spider-Man 2099\" #2.\n\"Ultimate Spider-Man\".\nAn arc in \"Ultimate Spider-Man\" is titled \"Spider-Man And His Amazing Friends\" and issue #118's cover, showing Spider-Man, Iceman, and Firestar, is a homage to the series title screen. Johnny Storm and Kitty Pryde are also said to be members of the team. Instead of Angelica Jones, Firestar is Liz Allan. Since then, in \"\", Spidey, Iceman, and the Human Torch have begun living together at Aunt May's house and have been working as a team as another homage to the series (because Liz, as Firestar, was a member of the X-Men in this continuity; this team roster also reflects the original intent of \"Amazing Friends\" to use the Human Torch before licensing issues forced the creation of Firestar).\n\"Amazing Friends\" in-continuity?\nIn 2007's \"Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe\u2014Spider-Man: Back in Black\" one-shot, the villain Videoman is given a brief biography from his \"retcon\" appearance in the \"Spider-Man Family\" one-shot. There is also an annotation describing an \"Earth 8107\", where an alternate reality Videoman was created by Electro to battle that world's Spider-Man. Later, in the same reality, Francis Byte is mutated by an exploding arcade console to become a new Videoman, and later \"possibly\" join the X-Men.\nSpider-Verse.\nThe Spider-Friends of Earth-1983 (described as a \"kinder, gentler than most\" world), except for Ms. Lion, are apparently killed by a dimension-hopping Morlun, set on draining the life out of every variation of Spider-Man across the multiverse.\n\"Iceman\" 2018.\nAt the \"Street Cart Named Desire Festival\", Peter sees Angelica, but does not seem to recognize her when explaining to Mary Jane that she's the only redhead that he's interested in. Bobby and Angelica briefly catch up before returning to their dates which are then interrupted by an ice monster attack. Iceman, Firestar, and Spider-Man suit up and defeat the attacker together. The team-up is called \"Iceman and His amazing Friends\" both on the issue's cover and by Iceman in the story. Afterward, the trio chat and Angelica and Bobby commiserate about men on dating apps.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "43074", "revid": "45364314", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43074", "title": "Firestar (Marvel Comics)", "text": "Firestar (Angelica \"Angel\" Jones) is a superhero appearing in media including American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by John Romita Sr., Rick Hoberg, and Dennis Marks, the character first appeared in 1981 on the NBC animated television series \"Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends\". Firestar has the ability to generate and manipulate microwave radiation, allowing her to fly and create intense heat and flames. In the comics, she has acted as a solo hero and also as a member of the Hellions, New Warriors, Avengers, and X-Men.\nDevelopment and publication history.\n\"Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends\".\nFirestar \u2013 spelled as Fire-Star \u2013 was created for the NBC animated series \"Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends\", with Kathy Garver providing her voice. This version of the character has the ability to control heat in all its forms, as stated in the 1981 \"Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends\" one-shot comic.\nThe creators had wanted to use the Human Torch, but the rights to the character were tied up. Firestar's pre-production names included Heatwave, Starblaze, and Firefly. Dennis Marks, one of the original writers of \"Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends\", stated in a 2002 interview that he had come up with the name of Fire-Star's alias, Angelica Jones, taken from one of his old girlfriends.\nIn the series, Fire-Star is identified as a former member of the X-Men, along with Iceman, with whom she occasionally appears to have a flirtatious relationship, and with whom she is sometimes seen on dates. At times, she dates Peter Parker (Spider-Man) as well, resulting in a relaxed love triangle of sorts. Fire-Star also has a one-episode romance with Sunfire.\nHer origin is explained in \"A Fire-Star is Born.\" Young Angelica Jones was subject to constant bullying by a schoolmate named Bonnie, who calls her \"Miss Angelica Jinx\" on account of mysterious events that occur in Angelica's presence, which unbeknownst to Bonnie and others around Angelica, are triggered by her newly emerging powers, of which Angelica is gradually becoming aware. As Angelica becomes fully aware that she is a mutant with superhuman abilities, she saves her father at one point during an accident while disguised.\nEarly in her senior year of high school, Bonnie and her boyfriend framed Angelica for the theft of a school trophy, causing Dean Wilmer to temporarily suspend Angelica from school. A strong need to correct this situation leads Angelica to become Fire-Star for the first time. She finds proof of Bonnie's deception, retrieved the missing trophy, and compels Bonnie to confess, which justifies her expulsion from school. She is later approached by Cyclops, Angel, and Iceman to join the X-Men. She accepted and was seen helping them against Magneto and the Sentinels.\nThe animated series and the one-shot \"Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends\" comic book (which adapted an episode for print) are not considered part of standard Marvel Universe continuity. However, the 2006 one-shot comic \"Spider-Man Family: Amazing Friends\" (August 2006) features an in-continuity story, \"Opposites Attack!\", in which the three superheroes work as a short-lived team. This story takes place shortly after the up-and-coming hero Firestar becomes a founding member of the New Warriors.\nFirestar mini-series.\nFirestar's first in-continuity comic book appearance was in \"Uncanny X-Men\" #193 (May 1985). She next appeared in her own mini-series, which presented her definitive, in-continuity origin. The \"Firestar\" four issue mini-series depicts events both before and after Firestar's appearance in \"Uncanny X-Men\" #193, showing her development from a shy, insecure girl afraid of her developing powers to a confident young woman capable of easily defeating Emma Frost.\nThe mini-series also established that Firestar's powers were microwave-based, rather than the more common fire-generation power that her animated counterpart displayed; the comic-book Firestar essentially harnesses ambient microwave radiation from her environment, making her powers far stronger in an environment such as space, where the concentration of microwaves is much greater than within a planetary atmosphere.\nEstablished character.\nAfter her initial miniseries, the character appeared in a five-part serialized story in issues #82\u201387 of the anthology series \"Marvel Comics Presents\". She subsequently joined the New Warriors, as a regular character in \"Avengers\", and the informal all-female team \"Marvel Divas\".\nAfter the special \"Firestar\" one-shot issue (April 2010), Firestar returned to full-time superheroics as a character in the short-lived comic series \"Young Allies\". Firestar appears as a main character in the \"I Am an Avenger\" comic book mini-series.\nFirestar was one of the feature characters in the 2011 six-issue limited series \"Fear Itself: Youth in Revolt\".\nAt the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con, Firestar was announced \"to take her place as a major X-Men character for the first time\" starring in the new comic book \"Amazing X-Men\" in November 2013.\nFirestar played prominent role in the 2023 \"Fall of X\" storyline. At the storyline's inception, Firestar is announced as a full member of the main X-Men team for the first time following a reader vote. During the course of the story, she selflessly plays a double agent role in the villainous organization Orchis, allowing the world and her teammates to believe she has betrayed mutantkind, on instructions from Jean Grey.\nFictional character biography.\nHellions.\nA lonely girl raised by her widowed father Bartholomew and paternal grandmother, Angelica Jones discovered that she possessed mutant powers. After her grandmother's death by heart failure and her revelation that she was a mutant, her father sent Angelica to the Massachusetts Academy. The Hellfire Club's original White Queen Emma Frost began training Angelica in the use of her powers for the Hellfire Club's team of young mutants. She was never sent on field missions with the other Hellions, however, because of her lack of control over her lethal powers and because the White Queen wished to instill cruelty and callousness in Firestar's personality, and befriending other young mutants would work against that goal. The White Queen manipulated Angelica into perceiving Frost as a loving mother figure, unaware that Frost was secretly grooming her to be a potential assassin and bodyguard. Angelica did meet the New Mutants at a Massachusetts Academy dance and, with the White Queen's telepathic prompting, formed a crush on Cannonball.\nFirestar was later emotionally manipulated by Empath, and accompanied the Hellions Thunderbird, Empath and Roulette on a mission against the X-Men, in which Thunderbird sought revenge on Xavier, thinking him responsible for his brother's death. Angelica felt terrible guilt over the incident once she was free of Empath's power, however. Professor Xavier offered her a place at the Xavier School, but although she declined out of loyalty to the White Queen, she was touched and pleased by the offer.\nWhile a student of the Massachusetts Academy, Angelica had Hellfire mercenary Randall Chase assigned to her as a bodyguard. Growing close to Angelica, Randall eventually began to suspect the White Queen's true motives and was to be terminated. He escaped, mortally wounded, and managed to warn Angelica of Frost's duplicity just before he died. In retaliation, Jones attacked and defeated the White Queen, and decimated the hidden training complex beneath Frost's Massachusetts Academy. Afterwards, she returned to living with her father (as she was still a minor at the time) but kept the unique costume and identity of Firestar given to her by Frost.\nFirestar was later to become one of the few surviving original Hellions after most members were murdered by Trevor Fitzroy. She, Warpath and Empath were the only members of the team not present during the massacre. Firestar and Warpath (accompanied by Warpath's X-Force teammate and Firestar's former love interest Cannonball), travelled to Nova Roma in Brazil to inform Empath and former New Mutant Magma of their teammates' deaths. The trio then went to the Massachusetts Academy where they removed the few remaining files on record of the Hellions' existence.\nNew Warriors.\nShortly after her resignation from the Massachusetts Academy, Firestar became a founding member of the New Warriors when she was invited (or rather blackmailed) by Night Thrasher into joining, and helped them battle Terrax. She also aided Night Thrasher against Midnight's Fire. She also helped Thor defeat the Juggernaut alongside the New Warriors. The team battled the Mad Thinker and Primus, and then battled Psionex.\nThe team battled the second Star Thief and Stane International's Mandroids. With teammates Marvel Boy and Namorita, and the Star Thief, she launched into space aboard a Stane rocket. They encountered the Inhumans and the Watcher on the Moon. With the help of Black Bolt and the Star Thief, she destroyed the Stane rocket containing hazardous waste.\nBack on Earth, the New Warriors battled the Force of Nature in a Brazilian jungle, and rescued teammate Speedball's mother. The New Warriors also battled the White Queen and her Hellions.\nEventually, she fell in love and became engaged to teammate Vance Astrovik (also known as Justice, formerly Marvel Boy). She later discovered that using her microwave powers could eventually render her infertile.\nDuring a revenge scheme by a gang of thugs called the Poison Memories, Firestar's father was shot in the chest. He nearly died but recovered. Firestar also faced a time without Vance, as he had to serve a prison term for the involuntary slaying of his own abusive father.\nFirestar also provided vital assistance in helping Spider-Man tackle Carnage during \"Maximum Carnage\", when he was also forced to ally himself with Venom, Black Cat and Morbius to stop Carnage's reign of slaughter. Her microwave power proved the only weapon truly effective against Carnage following his 'upgrade'\u2014his vulnerability to sonics having been weakened\u2014but she still refused to kill Carnage, even to stop his murders. For a time, she was briefly attracted to Spider-Man's clone, Ben Reilly, when he joined the New Warriors under the identity of the Scarlet Spider, but their relationship never went beyond an interest due to Firestar's engagement to Justice and Reilly's secrecy causing him to avoid revealing his identity.\nAvengers.\nFirestar and Justice eventually left the New Warriors together. Some time later the two joined the Avengers after an alternate-universe adventure and a struggle against Morgan le Fay. Firestar helped demonstrate her fitness for the position when she and Vance took down Whirlwind, a villain that had foiled most of the other Avengers at once.\nFirestar demonstrated a more restrained fashion sense, refusing to wear a cleavage-baring costume designed by the Wasp. Though she is seen wearing exactly that costume in an Avengers promo poster and in some early Avengers appearances, she quickly altered the costume to be more modest, which was consistent with her personality.\nDuring this period, Hank Pym determined that the cause of her potential infertility was that her natural immunity to the effects of her own powers (which all mutants possess) had never fully developed. He designed a costume for her that would siphon off the excess radiation, give her natural immunity the opportunity to manifest fully and heal the damage already done. After a distinguished tenure with the Avengers, including going undercover in a bizarre cult, facing a horde of Ultron robots, and struggling against Kang the Conqueror's takeover of modern-day Earth, she and Justice left the Avengers. She also made a tentative peace with Emma Frost during this time.\nAngelica started college and enjoyed a \"normal life\", but she abandoned wedding preparations, leaving Vance with all of the responsibility. When Vance confronted her about this, she confessed that she needed more life experience before settling into married life. Vance left in anger and presumably ended their engagement.\nRetirement.\nFirestar is one of the few mutants left on the planet with her powers intact after the Scarlet Witch altered reality and decimated the mutant population. Firestar was not among the New Warriors who died in the catastrophe that sparked the events of \"Civil War\". She was presumed to be among the Warriors who confronted the operator of an anti-Warriors hate site created in the wake of the catastrophe, revealed to be former Warriors member Carlton LaFroyge (Hindsight Lad). She is seen flying in the background, above the confrontation.\nFirestar responded to the Superhuman Registration Act by effectively retiring from her career as a costumed hero. She was seen as part of a New Warriors reunion of sorts with Nova and Justice, with whom she seems to be on good terms again.\nMarvel Divas.\nIn the limited series \"Marvel Divas\" (which was pitched as \"\"Sex and the City\" in the Marvel Universe\"), it is revealed Angelica's closest friends are Black Cat, Hellcat and Photon. At the end of the first issue, Firestar announces she has been diagnosed with cancer. She's later diagnosed by Doctor Strange and the Night Nurse as being in the earlier stages of the illness, provoked seemingly by the same inability to shield herself from her microwave emission powers that is making her infertile. Despite her bravery in dealing with the illness (she asks Patsy to write a book and a blog to relay her experience to other cancer survivors, strongly believing in her ability to heal), and Hank Pym offering her a second opinion (despite Pym actually being a biochemist, and not a physician), she is still in visible distress; enough for Daimon Hellstrom to approach his ex-wife Patsy, ensuring her fast healing in exchange for Patsy remarrying him (and giving him her soul in the process). Learning about Patsy's brave move to help in her recovery, Angelica and her supportive friends travelled to Hellstrom's dimension to rescue her, thereby rejecting his 'healing' help for Hellcat's freedom and taking her chances against the cancer. After returning to Earth, Angelica had a follow-up exam that revealed her cancer to be in complete remission. During this series, she is a New York University graduate student in art history, specializing in Medieval European art. Due to her chemotherapy, Angelica began to lose her hair. Initially opting for a wig, she decided to cut her hair short instead.\nOne-shot and Young Allies.\nFirestar continues her education while engaging in super heroics part-time. In her one-shot issue, she is wearing a long-haired red wig as her natural hair has not grown back yet.\nWhen the Bastards of Evil attack at the World Trade Center Ground Zero, she is the first of New York's heroes to respond. Shortly after, she is joined by Gravity, Nomad, Spider-Girl and Toro. The five heroes unite to defeat the menace, but are not taken seriously by the established teams (the Fantastic Four and Avengers) to arrive after the battle.\nThe group worked to track down the Bastards of Evil, Firestar partnering with Gravity while the others pursued independent leads. In addition to tracking the Bastards, Firestar and Gravity begin to patrol the city at night fighting street level crime. During this period, Angelica is dismissive of Nomad and Spider-Girl, which she later regrets as it wasn't that long ago that she was an adolescent super hero.\nWhen Nomad and Spider-Girl are captured by the Bastards on their way to meet Gravity and Firestar, Angelica is able to use her microwave powers to track the Bastards and is able to drain the radiation that empowers them. With Gravity's help, she is able to expel the energy harmlessly into space. Nomad suggests that they remain together as the Young Allies, which everyone objects to, and they appear to go their separate ways.\nIn the final issue of \"Young Allies\" (issue #6), Emma Frost attempts to recruit Angelica to move to Utopia with the rest of the mutant population. No offer to join the X-Men was explicitly made, but as most of the mutants living in Utopia appear to be on call as needed, it can be assumed that if Firestar moved she would have been available to the team. Angelica refused the offer, eventually burning down Emma's hotel room to be left alone. Gravity and Firestar continue their evening patrols, and Frost suggests that Gravity has a romantic/sexual interest in her. He also appears to recognize her civilian identity when he sees her in a coffee shop, but she does not notice him.\nThe Young Allies are continuing to operate as a loosely affiliated team to fight Onslaught alongside the Secret Avengers in \"Onslaught Unleashed\", despite the cancellation of their own series. Then Firestar appears at a meeting held by Prodigy regarding magical hammers that have crashed into the earth. She and Gravity agree to co-lead an Initiative team to help keep order during the crisis. After Gravity is injured in a fight with Crossbones, she assumes full command until she and Prodigy travel to Las Vegas to assist with the damage control efforts after the Juggernaut's attack on the city and subsequent battle with the Heavy Hitters. Reunited with Gravity, who also went to Las Vegas to confront Heavy Hitters leader Hardball regarding civilian casualties during the fight, Firestar joined Gravity, Hardball and Telemetry on a mission to prevent seismic damage to the area. Believing they were going to die, she and Gravity revealed their secret identities to each other. Following the end of Fear Itself, Firestar has been seen with Gravity and their former Young Allies associate Spider-Girl fighting Hydro Man, indicating the group is still working together.\nFirestar applied for a teaching job at the Jean Grey School of Higher Learning but when she admitted that she had a thing for Iceman she was rejected as Kitty Pryde, the headmistress of the school who was doing the interviewing, was at the time Iceman's girlfriend.\nX-Men.\nFirestar joined the X-Men as a new teacher in the Jean Grey School assigned to teaching physics. After being dragged to Hell with other members of the X-Men, she was pulled into a quest to search for the deceased Nightcrawler, at one point setting Hell itself on fire to stop a wave of demons attacking her and Iceman, an action that notably impressed Nightcrawler. Later on, after returning to Earth, Firestar and Iceman encountered Spider-Man. She participated in the containment of a massive Wendigo outbreak in Canada, became a member of the New Tian Strikeforce after Hydra's brief takeover of the USA, and battled X-Man and Carnage.\nOrchis.\nAfter the establishment of the mutant colony on Krakoa, Firestar was slated to become a full-time member of the X-Men. Shortly after, however, Orchis attacked the island, slaying several mutants, including Jean Grey. As she lay dying, Grey telepathically instructed Firestar to join Orchis as a mole, leading the other X-Men to believe that she allowed Orchis access to Krakoa. In this role, she was confronted by Kitty Pryde and her ex-fianc\u00e9 Justice. She was eventually exposed, but rescued by Pryde, Emma Frost and Synch to participate in their final strike against Orchis.\nWest Coast Avengers.\nHowever, the trauma of having worked for a mutant-hating organization caused Firestar to sink into an alcohol-drowned depression. In this state, she was invited by James Rhodes to join the new West Coast Avengers which he and Tony Stark were putting together, which included several former supervillains like Ultron and Blue Bolt in their lineup. In her feeling of fatalism, she made callous mistakes, like injuring people she was supposed to subdue. However, Blue Bolt, after giving her a kiss before willingly returning to prison, managed to talk some sense back into her; a deed which evolved into a mutual romantic attraction.\nPowers and abilities.\nFirestar is a mutant whose body stores ambient radioactive/electromagnetic energy, which she can project and manipulate for various effects. As she alters the electromagnetic wavelengths, they form a microwave aura around her body, at which point she mentally \"pushes\" the microwaves away from herself. Doing this allows her to release heat, light, and radiation into her environment at various intensities. By focusing microwaves on a specific target, she can cause it to burst into flames, explode, or melt. She can project microwave energy blasts, which have a thermo-concussive effect, heating objects to the point of melting or incineration. The superheated and pressurized air created by the directed microwaves produces an impact. Firestar can also sense microwave signals (such as cellular phone signals or remote-control devices) and disrupt electronics with her own microwave emissions. By superheating the air around her, Firestar can generate enough upward thrust to fly at high speeds and lift objects as heavy as the X-Man Colossus. Firestar's mutant abilities do not grant her any particular immunity to the effects of intense heat other than that generated by her own microwave powers. During training exercises with Emma Frost in her limited series, she was chastised by her teacher for clumsiness and warned that she could have been \"severely burned\" by a laser. During a fight between the Avengers and Fantastic Four years later, the Human Torch was afraid of burning her with his own flames. However, she eventually displayed the ability to siphon heat energy and to detect electromagnetic signatures from broadcast transmissions.\nThough exposure to high levels of microwave radiation can be harmful or fatal to living beings, Firestar is apparently immune to most of the damaging effects of her powers. Unlike most mutants, her immunity to her own power was not complete; she was in danger of rendering herself sterile until Hank Pym discovered a cure. He designed a suit of micro-circuitry to be worn under her costume that absorbed the excess microwave energy that was affecting her cells and diverted it in a way that would \"kick start\" her natural immunity to her own powers. Pym claimed it would take about six months for the process to be complete. Over time, Firestar appeared to be functionally immune to microwave radiation. She was later diagnosed with breast cancer, which was attributed to long-term exposure to her own power. Though the cancer is in remission, the current status of her immunity is unknown.\nOn rare occasion, Firestar has demonstrated the ability to disrupt the psionic powers of others using her own power (namely, Emma Frost, Empath, and the Darkling). She is not immune to psychic assault, but when using microwave abilities at a high level she is capable of disrupting it. Onslaught, and the Gamesmaster, were both able to use telepathy against her effectively.\nThe nature of Firestar's power is actually broader than first perceived, not only granting her the capacity for large-scale destruction but a wider range of capacities through nuclear fission interaction. In an alternative future timeline, it is discovered that her true power lies in conducting and channeling the electroweak force to better manipulate electromagnetic spectrum phenomena. Jones typically limits how much of her own power she accesses, fearing that she might permanently damage the planet, its atmosphere, and electromagnetic field. In space, she is far less inhibited and can access greater levels of ambient electromagnetic energy to fuel her powers. She easily produced an attack that injured Garthan Saal when he possessed the energy of the entire Nova Corps, and also used her enhanced abilities to power a massive Shi'ar interstellar transport gate with very little effort.\nReception.\nCritical reception.\nDeirdre Kaye of \"Scary Mommy\" called Firestar a \"role model\" and \"truly heroic.\" Darren Franich of \"Entertainment Weekly\" ranked Firestar 34th in their \"Let's rank every Avenger ever\" list. \"CBR.com\" ranked Firestar 4th in their \"10 Most Powerful Members of The New Warriors\" list, 8th in their \"20 Most Powerful Mutants From The '80s\" list, \"CBR.com\" ranked Firestar 4th in their \"10 Most Powerful Members of The New Warriors\" list, and 15th in their \"20 Most Powerful Female Members Of The Avengers\" list.\nIn December 2022, Anthony Orland of \"Digital Trends\" called Firestar one of the \"12 new Marvel characters we want to see in the Spider-Man 4 movie.\" Jordan Iacobucci of \"Screen Rant\" included Firestar in their \"10 Marvel Superheroes From The \u201880s Who Should Join The MCU\" list, while Lukas Shayo named her one of the \"10 Iconic New York City-Based Marvel Superheroes We Haven't Seen In The MCU\" list.\nImpact.\nIn July 2022, Marvel Comics announced that Firestar was the winner of the second annual X-Men fan vote.\nOther versions.\nSpider-Verse.\nAppearing in \"Edge of Spider-Verse: Web of Fear\", Spider-UK (a British Spider-Man who is a member of the Captain Britain Corps) witnesses Morlun kill Spider-Man, as well as Firestar and Iceman lying dead. This universe is an alternate version of \"Spider-Man and his Amazing Friends\" (Earth-1983).\nExiles.\nAn alternate version of Firestar was forced to join the team known as Weapon X, a group of alternate reality-hopping super-people bound to repair broken worlds. Joining the team, Angelica was soon killed in a mega-blast unleashed by her own powers, opposing the evil Hyperion. In the process, her sacrifice also killed Spider. Because her body was reduced to ash, it was not returned to its native universe (Earth-3062).\nMarvel Zombies vs. Army of Darkness.\nIn issue #3 of this miniseries, she is shown, in flashback, to be among the reserve members of the Avengers answering Colonel America's distress signal (unaware it was a trap), and subsequently leaving the mansion (with fewer people than went in) infected and hungry for human flesh.\nMC2.\nFirestar appeared in a flashback detailing the last adventure of the original Avengers. Firestar was among the team members who died in the team's final battle.\nMutant X.\nIn the Mutant X Universe, Firestar's powers had evolved to the point where her entire body was composed of microwave energy. She was one of the many people trying to resist the rule of Madelyne Pryor. She, along with numerous other heroes, died in battle in the final issue of \"Mutant X\".\nSpider-Man Loves Mary-Jane.\nFirestar appeared in \"Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane\". In the initial Firestar story, Mary Jane watched Spider-Man and Firestar battling crime together and became very jealous. In subsequent issues, Firestar expressed a true romantic interest in Spider-Man. The Firestar story arc took place in issues #16-20 of the series and was compiled in digest format as \"Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane, Vol. 4\". Also, Iceman appears in a few pages of the final issue of the story arc, showcasing a rare comic-book moment in which the \"Spider-Friends\" are shown together.\nUltimate Marvel.\nBrian Michael Bendis, writer of \"Ultimate Spider-Man\", revealed his intentions to have the Ultimate Marvel version of Firestar appear in the book in an interview on Comic Book Resources on July 20, 2007. Bendis further stated he had spent 120 issues working toward this and making it an \"organic\" event and not something \"I pulled out of my ass\".\nUltimate Firestar makes her debut in \"Ultimate Spider-Man\" #118, when Liz Allan claims to be suffering from some bizarre ailment shortly after kissing the Human Torch, and at the close of the issue catches fire while at a beach party with her friends. In the final moments of the story, Liz's body becomes a living mass of flames, signaling her transformation into what could be considered Ultimate Firestar.\nThe next issue (#119) deals with Liz as she tried to come to grips with her powers. The Human Torch is forced to deal with a call from the Fantastic Four, while Shadowcat is grounded, leaving only Iceman and Spider-Man able to go after Liz, an homage to the \"Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends\" television series. After some friendly banter, Magneto shows up, asking Liz to come with him so that he can take her to her biological father. Unsure of what to do, Liz goes home to confront her mother who reveals that her uncle Frank is in fact her real father. Magneto and the X-Men, summoned by Spider-Man, then show up asking Liz to side with one of them. Liz chooses neither and flees to Mary Jane's house.\nSpider-Man quickly follows her there, and to convince her of his words, he reveals his true identity. She is greatly moved by this and refers to him as an \"amazing friend\". Swayed, Liz then thinks it might be cool to join the X-Men, leaving for the mansion alongside Iceman. The issue ends with a flashback that reveals that Liz's father is in fact the Blob. It was revealed in \"Ultimate X-Men\" #94 that Liz has chosen the codename Firestar, and has some control of her powers.\nLiz Allan was believed to have been missing in action after Ultimatum, but survived and is featured in \"\" beginning with issue #4. In this issue, it is revealed she, her mother and her newfound half-brother Teddy (and son of the Blob) try to make a fresh start in California. She often teases Teddy because, as she says, he reminds her of her father, though her mother speculates it might be because he reminds her of what she is. When Teddy's friend kills the high school's principal, Teddy's powers manifest, and the situation goes awry. When approached by Jean Grey's Tomorrow People and Quicksilver's Brotherhood, Liz chooses to follow Jean whereas Teddy joins Quicksilver. After briefly working with the team, she settles in Tian, a safe haven for mutants, until its destruction. She then rejoins the X-Men. She also attended a small party that commemorated Peter a few years after his death with Iceman and Human Torch.\nSins of Sinister.\nA specially designed mutant amalgam by the designation, Chimera, used Angelica Jones' DNA template in the production and implementation by the Quiet Council after it'd been corrupted by Sinister's machinations. The Fusee entity utilized Firestar's Nuclear Fission &amp; Weak Force alternation powers in conjunction with the genetic gifts pertaining to other gene donors in its function as a living dirty bomb, meant to shatter planets during Krakoa's galactic conquests.\nIn other media.\nMiscellaneous.\nIn 1987, Firestar appeared as a guest in Marvel Comics' live reenactment of Spider-Man's wedding to Mary Jane Watson.\nMerchandise.\nFirestar has been merchandised in various forms. In 1994, a Firestar Real Heros cup was available at Pizza Hut. Wizard Entertainment introduced a Firestar action figure offered in \"Toyfare Magazine\" #2 in 1997. Wizkids marketed Firestar HeroClix figurines (set of 4) in November 2004. Art Asylum produced a Firestar Minimate action figure in 2005. In December 2007, Diamond Select released a 6-inch Firestar minibust. Firestar is featured on cards in the Marvel Universe Trading Cards Series 1 (1990, card #85), Series 2 (1991, cards #32 and 156), Series 3 (1992, card #174), Series 4 (1993, card #20), and Series 5 (1994, cards #20 and 73). Firestar was also included in a number of T-shirts, posters, and art prints featuring New Warriors. In February 2021 Hasbro released a 6\u201d Marvel Legends action figure of Firestar.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "43076", "revid": "45364314", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43076", "title": "Superhero", "text": "Type of character\nA superhero or superheroine, is a character who typically possesses \"superpowers\" or abilities beyond those of ordinary people, is frequently costumed concealing their identity, and fits the role of the hero, typically using their powers to help the world become a better place, or dedicating themselves to protecting the public and fighting crime. Superhero fiction is the genre of fiction that is centered on such characters, especially, since the 1930s, in American comic books (and later in Hollywood films, film serials, television and video games), as well as in Japanese media (including \"kamishibai\", \"tokusatsu\", manga, anime and video games).\nSuperheroes come from a wide array of different backgrounds and origins. Most superheroes (for example, Superman and Spider-Man) usually possess non-human or superhuman biology, while others (such as Batman and Iron Man) derive their status from advanced technology they create and use, but some of them may use or possess objects that have superhuman, mystical, or alien powers (such as Green Lantern and He-Man), or study and practice magic to achieve their abilities (such as Doctor Fate and Doctor Strange). The \"Dictionary.com\" definition of \"superhero\" is \"a figure, especially in a comic strip or cartoon, endowed with superhuman powers and usually portrayed as fighting evil or crime,\" and the Merriam-Webster dictionary gives the definition as \"a fictional hero having extraordinary or superhuman powers; also: an exceptionally skillful or successful person.\" Terms such as masked crime fighters, costumed adventurers or masked vigilantes are sometimes used to refer to characters such as the Spirit, who may not be explicitly referred to as superheroes but nevertheless share similar traits.\nSome superheroes use their powers to help fight daily crime while also combating threats against humanity from \"supervillains\", who are their criminal counterparts. Often at least one of these supervillains will be the superhero's archenemy or \"nemesis\". Some popular supervillains become recurring characters in their own right.\nHistory.\nInfluences.\nAntecedents of the archetype include mythological characters such as Hanuman, Gilgamesh, Odysseus, and David, and demigods like Heracles, and Perseus, all of whom were blessed with extraordinary abilities, which later inspired the superpowers that became a fundamental aspect of modern-day superheroes. The distinct clothing and costumes of individuals from English folklore, like Robin Hood and Spring-Heeled Jack, also became inspirations. The dark costume of the latter, complete with a domino mask and a cape, became influential for the myriad of masked rogues in penny dreadfuls and dime novels.\nThe vigilantes of the American Old West also became an influence to the superhero. Several vigilantes during this time period hid their identities using masks. In frontier communities where de jure law was not yet matured, people sometimes took the law into their own hands with makeshift masks made out of sacks. Vigilante mobs and gangs like the San Diego Vigilantes and the Bald Knobbers became infamous throughout that Old West era. Such masked vigilantism later inspired fictional masked crimefighters in American story-telling, beginning with the character Deadwood Dick in 1877.\n1900s\u20131939.\nThe word superhero dates back to 1899. The 1903 British play \"The Scarlet Pimpernel\" and its spinoffs popularized the idea of a masked avenger and the superhero trope of a secret identity. Over the next few decades, masked and costumed pulp fiction characters such as Jimmie Dale/The Grey Seal (1914), Tarzan (1912), John Carter (1912), Zorro (1919), Buck Rogers (1928), The Shadow (1930), Lensman (1934) and Flash Gordon (1934), film serial heroes Judex (1916) and Ravengar (1916) and comic strip heroes such as the Mandrake the Magician (1934), Magic Phantom (1935), Phantom (1936), began appearing, as did non-costumed characters with super strength, including the comic-strip characters Patoruz\u00fa (1928) and Popeye (1929) and literary characters such as Hugo Danner (\"Gladiator\", 1930) and Aarn Munro (\"The Mightiest Machine\", 1934). Another early example was Sarutobi Sasuke, a Japanese superhero ninja from the Japanese folklore and children's novels in the 1910s; by 1914, he had a number of superhuman powers and abilities. France produced early examples like the superheroine L'Oiselle, ccreated in 1909 by French writer Ren\u00e9e Marie Gouraud d'Ablancourt under her pen name Ren\u00e9 d'Anjou. The character, whose real name is Vega de Ortega, is notable as one of literature's earliest winged heroines, utilizing artificial wings for flight and the cyborg Nyctalope (1911), possessing two revolutionary enhancements for the period - enhanced nocturnal vision and an electromechanical cardiac implant, \"Famany\", the \"flying man\" of a German comic story of 1937, who uses a winged apparatus to fly over New York and who becomes embroiled in the world of crime, had only one appearance.\nThe pulp magazines of the 1930s served as a crucial breeding ground for early superhero concepts through their innovative comic features:\nIn August 1936, \"Thrilling Wonder Stories\" published Zarnak by ax Plaisted. In August 1937, a letter column of the magazine, the word \"superhero\" was used to define the title character. Another groundbreaking character emerged in August 1937, Olga Mesmer, \"The Girl with the X-ray Eyes,\" featured in a single-page comic strip in \"Spicy Mystery Stories\".\nIn addition to fictional sources, the superhero archetype may also have been influenced by real-life strongmen such as Siegmund Breitbart, Joseph Greenstein, Eugen Sandow, and Charles Atlas. Charles Atlas, in particular, gained lasting cultural visibility through his mail-order fitness program and his iconic advertisements published directly in comic books.\nThe trends converged in some of the earliest superpowered costumed heroes, such as Japan's \u014cgon Bat (1931) and Prince of Gamma (early 1930s), who first appeared in \"kamishibai\" (a kind of hybrid media combining pictures with live storytelling). Superman (1938) and Captain Marvel (1939) at the beginning of the Golden Age of Comic Books, whose span, though disputed, is generally agreed to have started with Superman's launch. Superman has remained one of the most recognizable superheroes, and his success spawned a new archetype of characters with secret identities and superhuman powers. At the end of the decade, in 1939, Batman was created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger. This era saw the debut of one of the earliest female superheroes, Magician from Mars, created by John Giunta and Malcolm Kildale for Centaur Publications in \"Amazing-Man Comics\". She appeared in five issues (#7-11, Nov 1939 to Apr 1940), predating many other Golden Age superheroines. Jane 6\u1d07\u1d0d35, later known as Q-X3, was a hybrid of Earth and Martian origins born on Mars. As a baby, she was exposed to a beam of cathode rays, which, combined with her hybrid physiology, gave her extraordinary powers, including superstrength, telekinesis, illusion creation, and even matter transformation.\n1940s.\nDuring the 1940s there were many superheroes: The Flash, Green Lantern and Blue Beetle debuted in this era.\nOther pioneering superheroines include Fantomah and the Invisible Scarlet O'Neil. Fantomah, created by Fletcher Hanks, was an ageless ancient Egyptian woman in the modern day who could transform into a skull-faced creature with superpowers to fight evil; she debuted in Fiction House's \"Jungle Comic\" #2 (Feb. 1940), credited to the pseudonymous \"Barclay Flagg\". A few months later, the Invisible Scarlet O'Neil, a non-costumed character who fought crime and wartime saboteurs using the superpower of invisibility created by Russell Stamm, would debut in the eponymous syndicated newspaper comic strip a few months later on June 3, 1940.\nIn 1940, Maximo the Amazing Superman debut in Big Little Book series, by Russell R. Winterbotham (text), Henry E. Vallely and Erwin L. Hess (art).\n Captain America also appeared for the first time in print in December 1940, a year prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese government, when America was still in isolationism. Created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, the superhero was the physical embodiment of the American spirit during World War II.\nOne superpowered character was portrayed as an antiheroine, a rarity for its time: the Black Widow, a costumed emissary of Satan who killed evildoers in order to send them to Hell\u2014debuted in \"Mystic Comics\" #4 (Aug. 1940), from Timely Comics, the 1940s predecessor of Marvel Comics. Most of the other female costumed crime fighters during this era lacked superpowers. Notable characters include the Woman in Red, introduced in Standard Comics' \"Thrilling Comics\" #2 (March 1940); Lady Luck, debuting in the Sunday-newspaper comic-book insert \"The Spirit Section\" June 2, 1940; the comedic character Red Tornado, debuting in \"All-American Comics\" #20 (Nov 1940); Miss Fury, debuting in the eponymous comic strip by female cartoonist Tarp\u00e9 Mills on April 6, 1941; the Phantom Lady, introduced in Quality Comics \"Police Comics\" #1 (Aug. 1941); the Black Cat, introduced in Harvey Comics' \"Pocket Comics\" #1 (also Aug. 1941); and the Black Canary, introduced in \"Flash Comics\" #86 (Aug. 1947) as a supporting character. The most iconic comic book superheroine, who debuted during the Golden Age, is Wonder Woman. Modeled from the myth of the Amazons of Greek mythology, she was created by psychologist William Moulton Marston, with help and inspiration from his wife Elizabeth and their mutual lover Olive Byrne. Wonder Woman's first appearance was in \"All Star Comics\" #8 (Dec. 1941), published by All-American Publications, one of two companies that would merge to form DC Comics in 1944.\nIn the 1943 cartoon parody of \"Superman\", \"Super-Rabbit\", Bugs Bunny ingests \"super-carrots\" created by \"Professor Cannafraz\" and acquires various super powers including the ability to fly, super strength and invulnerability. Like his counterpart, Bugs also assumes a mild mannered secret identity by donning glasses and a hat and switches into a super hero costume in a phone booth.https://\nP\u00e9r\u00e1k was an urban legend originating from the city of Prague during the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in the midst of World War II. In the decades following the war, P\u00e9r\u00e1k has also been portrayed as the only Czech superhero in film and comics.\n1950s.\nIn 1952, Osamu Tezuka's manga \"Tetsuwan Atom\", more popularly known in the West as \"Astro Boy\", was published. The series focused upon a robot boy built by a scientist to replace his deceased son. Being built from an incomplete robot originally intended for military purposes, Astro Boy possessed amazing powers such as flight through thrusters in his feet and the incredible mechanical strength of his limbs.\nThe 1950s saw the Silver Age of Comics. During this era DC introduced the likes of Batwoman in 1956, Supergirl, Miss Arrowette, and Bat-Girl; all female derivatives of established male superheroes.\nIn 1957 Japan, Shintoho produced the first film serial featuring the superhero character Super Giant, signaling a shift in Japanese popular culture towards \"tokusatsu\" masked superheroes over \"kaiju\" giant monsters. Along with \"Astro Boy\", the \"Super Giant\" serials had a profound effect on Japanese television. 1958 saw the debut of superhero \"Moonlight Mask\" on Japanese television. It was the first of numerous televised superhero dramas that would make up the \"tokusatsu\" superhero genre. Created by K\u014dhan Kawauchi, he followed up its success with the tokusatsu superhero shows \"Seven Color Mask\" (1959) and \"Messenger of Allah\" (1960), both starring a young Sonny Chiba, a manga adaptation, illustrated by Ippei Kuri (brother of Speed Racer creator Tatsuo Yoshida), was serialized in \"B\u014dken \u014c\" magazine.\n1960s.\nIt is arguable that the Marvel Comics teams of the early 1960s brought the biggest assortment of superheroes ever at one time into permanent publication, the likes of Spider-Man, The Hulk, Iron Man, Daredevil, Nick Fury, Thor, The Avengers (featuring a rebooted Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Ant-Man and Quicksilver), and many others were given their own monthly titles.\nTypically the superhero supergroups featured at least one (and often the only) female member, much like DC's flagship superhero team the Justice League of America (whose initial roster included Wonder Woman as the token female); examples include the Fantastic Four's Invisible Girl, the X-Men's Jean Grey (originally known as Marvel Girl), the Avengers' Wasp, and the Brotherhood of Mutants' Scarlet Witch (who later joined the Avengers) with her brother, Quicksilver.\nIn 1963, \"Astro Boy\" was adapted into a highly influential anime television series. \"Phantom Agents\" in 1964 focused on ninjas working for the Japanese government and would be the foundation for Sentai-type series. 1966 saw the debut of the sci-fi/horror series \"Ultra Q\" created by Eiji Tsuburaya this would eventually lead to the sequel \"Ultraman\", spawning a successful franchise which pioneered the Kyodai Hero subgenre where the superheroes would be as big as giant monsters (\"kaiju\") that they fought.\nThe \"kaiju\" monster Godzilla, originally a villain, began being portrayed as a radioactive superhero in the \"Godzilla\" films, starting with \"Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster\" (1964). By the 1970s, Godzilla came to be viewed as a superhero, with the magazine \"King of the Monsters\" in 1977 describing Godzilla as \"Superhero of the '70s.\"\n1970s.\nIn 1971, \"Kamen Rider\" launched the \"Henshin Boom\" on Japanese television in the early 1970s, greatly impacting the tokusatsu superhero genre in Japan. In 1972, the \"Science Ninja Team Gatchaman\" anime debuted, which built upon the superhero team idea of the live-action \"Phantom Agents\" as well as introducing different colors for team members and special vehicles to support them, said vehicles could also combine into a larger one. Another important event was the debut of \"Mazinger Z\" by Go Nagai, creating the Super Robot genre. Go Nagai also wrote the manga \"Cutey Honey\" in 1973; although the Magical girl genre already existed, Nagai's manga introduced Transformation sequences that would become a staple of Magical Girl media.\nThe 1970s would see more anti-heroes introduced into Superhero fiction such examples included the debut of Shotaro Ishinomori's Skull Man (the basis for his later \"Kamen Rider\") in 1970, Go Nagai's Devilman in 1972 and Gerry Conway and John Romita's Punisher in 1974.\nThe dark Skull Man manga would later get a television adaptation and underwent drastic changes. The character was redesigned to resemble a grasshopper, becoming the renowned first masked hero of the Kamen Rider series. Kamen Rider is a motorcycle-riding hero in an insect-like costume, who shouts Henshin (Metamorphosis) to don his costume and gain superhuman powers.\nThe ideas of second-wave feminism, which spread through the 1960s into the 1970s, greatly influenced the way comic book companies would depict as well as market their female characters: Wonder Woman was for a time revamped as a mod-dressing martial artist directly inspired by the Emma Peel character from the British television series \"The Avengers\" (no relation to the superhero team of the same name), but later reverted to Marston's original concept after the editors of \"Ms.\" magazine publicly disapproved of the character being depowered and without her traditional costume; Supergirl was moved from being a secondary feature on \"Action Comics\" to headline \"Adventure Comics\" in 1969; the Lady Liberators appeared in an issue of \"The Avengers\" as a group of mind-controlled superheroines led by Valkyrie (actually a disguised supervillainess) and were meant to be a caricatured parody of feminist activists; and Jean Grey became the embodiment of a cosmic being known as the Phoenix Force with seemingly unlimited power in the late 1970s, a stark contrast from her depiction as the weakest member of her team a decade prior.\nBoth major American publishers began introducing new superheroines with a more distinct feminist theme as part of their origin stories or character development. Examples include Big Barda, Power Girl, and the Huntress by DC comics; and from Marvel, the second Black Widow, Shanna the She-Devil, and The Cat. Female supporting characters who were successful professionals or hold positions of authority in their own right also debuted in the pages of several popular superhero titles from the late 1950s onward: Hal Jordan's love interest Carol Ferris was introduced as the Vice-President of Ferris Aircraft and later took over the company from her father; Medusa, who was first introduced in the \"Fantastic Four\" series, is a member of the Inhuman Royal Family and a prominent statesperson within her people's quasi-feudal society; and Carol Danvers, a decorated officer in the United States Air Force who would become a costumed superheroine herself years later.\nIn 1975 Shotaro Ishinomori's \"Himitsu Sentai Gorenger\" debuted on what is now TV Asahi, it brought the concepts of multi-colored teams and supporting vehicles that debuted in Gatchaman into live-action, and began the \"Super Sentai\" franchise (later adapted into the American \"Power Rangers\" series in the 1990s). In 1978, Toei adapted Spider-Man into a live-action Japanese television series. In this continuity, Spider-Man had a vehicle called Marveller that could transform into a giant and powerful robot called Leopardon, this idea would be carried over to Toei's Battle Fever J (also co-produced with Marvel) and now multi-colored teams not only had support vehicles but giant robots to fight giant monsters with.\n1980\u2013present.\nIn subsequent decades, popular characters like Dazzler, She-Hulk, Elektra, Catwoman, Witchblade, Spider-Girl, Batgirl and the Birds of Prey became stars of long-running eponymous titles. Female characters began assuming leadership roles in many ensemble superhero teams; the \"Uncanny X-Men\" series and its related spin-off titles in particular have included many female characters in pivotal roles since the 1970s. Volume 4 of the X-Men comic book series featured an all-female team as part of the Marvel NOW! branding initiative in 2013. Superpowered female characters like Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Darna have a tremendous influence on popular culture in their respective countries of origin.\nWith more and more anime, manga and tokusatsu being translated or adapted, Western audiences were beginning to experience the Japanese styles of superhero fiction more than they were able to before. Saban's \"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers\", an adaptation of \"Zyuranger\", created a multimedia franchise that used footage from Super Sentai. Internationally, the Japanese comic book character, Sailor Moon, is recognized as one of the most important and popular female superheroes ever created.\nTrademark status.\nBackground.\nThe first use of the phrase \"super hero\" dates back to 1917. At the time, the phrase was merely used to describe a \"public figure of great accomplishments.\" In 1967, Ben Cooper, Inc., an American Halloween costume manufacturer, became the first entity to commercialize the phrase \"super hero\" when it registered the mark in connection with Halloween costumes. In 1972, Mego Corporation, an American toy company, attempted to register the mark \"World's Greatest Superheroes\" in connection with its line of action figures. Mego Corporation\u2019s attempted registration led Ben Cooper, Inc. to sue Mego Corporation for trademark infringement. Due to its financial struggles, Mego Corporation was unwilling to defend itself against Ben Cooper Inc.'s suit. As a result, in 1977, Mego Corporation jointly assigned its interest in the trademark to DC Comics, Inc. (\"DC\") and Marvel Comics (\"Marvel\"). Due to the financial prowess of DC and Marvel, Ben Cooper, Inc. decided to withdraw its trademark opposition and jointly assigned its interest in the \"World's Greatest Super Heroes\" mark to DC and Marvel. Two years later in 1979, DC and Marvel applied for the mark in connection with comic books, and were granted the mark by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in 1981.\nIn the years leading up to the assignment of the mark, both DC and Marvel battled to register various trademarks involving the phrase \"superhero.\" However, DC and Marvel quickly discovered that they could only register marks involving the phrase \"superhero\" if the phrase referenced their own company or a character associated with their company. As a result, DC and Marvel decided to become joint owners of the \"superhero\" trademark.\nAlthough joint ownership in a trademark is uncommon, the USPTO will grant joint ownership in a mark. In the case \"Arrow Trading Co., Inc. v. Victorinox A.G. and Wegner S.A.\", Opposition No. 103315 (TTAB June 27, 2003), the TTAB held that when \"two entities have a long-standing relationship and rely on each other for quality control, it may be found, in appropriate circumstances, that the parties, as joint owners, do represent a single source.\"\nDC and Marvel have continued to expand their commercialization of the \"superhero\" mark to categories beyond comic books. Now, the two publishers jointly own numerous trademarks for figurines (see Spider-Man, Batman), movies, TV shows, magazines, merchandise, cardboard stand-up figures, playing cards, erasers, pencils, notebooks, cartoons, and many more. For instance, the companies filed a trademark application as joint owners for the mark \"SUPER HEROES\" for a series of animated motion pictures in 2009 (Reg. No. 5613972). Both DC and Marvel also individually owned trademarks involving the \"super hero\" mark. Notably, DC owns the mark \"Legion of Super-Heroes\" for comic magazines and Marvel owns the mark \"Marvel Super Hero Island\" for story books, fiction books, and children\u2019s activity books.\nDC and Marvel have become known for aggressively protecting their registered marks. In 2019, the companies pursued a British law student named Graham Jules who was attempting to publish a self-help book titled \"Business Zero to Superhero\". Much academic debate exists about whether the \"super hero\" mark has become generic and whether DC and Marvel have created a duopoly over the \"super hero\" mark. Conversely, DC and Marvel hold that they are merely exercising their right and duty to protect their registered marks.\nCurrent status/relevant cases.\nThe following trademarks were or are registered jointly with MARVEL CHARACTERS, INC. and DC COMICS:\nAs mentioned, the two companies also own a variety of other superhero-related marks. For instance, DC owns \"Legion of Super-Heroes\" and \"DC Super Hero Girls\" and Marvel owns \u201cMarvel Super Hero Island\" and \"Marvel Super Hero Adventures.\"\nDC and Marvel have garnered a reputation for zealously protecting their superhero marks. As noted above, one of these instances included a man by the name of Graham Jules, who sought to publish a book entitled \"Business Zero to Superhero\". In 2014, he received a cease and desist from DC and Marvel who claimed that his use of the term superhero would cause confusion and dilute their brands. He was offered a few thousand dollars in settlement to change the name of his book, but he did not concede. A few days prior to the scheduled hearing at the Intellectual Property Office in London, the companies backed down.\nA similar scenario occurred when comic book creator Ray Felix attempted to register his comic book series \"A World Without Superheroes\" with the USPTO. Felix is one of many who argue that the term \"superhero\" has become generic (see discussion below). Felix's mark is currently abandoned, but he has stated that he intends to fight against DC and Marvel for use of the term.\nIn 2024, Superbabies Limited managed to obtain a default judgement and cancel the \"super heroes\" trademarks as genericized, except for the animation pictures mark. This was unexpected as Marvel and DC had filed a motion to extend time to answer.\nOngoing legal debate.\nThere is an ongoing debate among legal scholars and in the courts about whether the term \"superhero\" has become genericized due to its widespread use in popular culture, similar to terms like \"aspirin\" or \"escalator\" which lost their trademark protection and became generic terms for their respective products. Some argue the term \"SUPER HERO\" trademark is at risk of becoming generic.\nCourts have noted that determining whether a term has become generic is a highly factual inquiry not suitable for resolution without considering evidence like dictionary definitions, media usage, and consumer surveys. Trademark owners can take steps to prevent genericide, such as using the trademark with the generic product name, educating the public, and policing unauthorized uses. However, misuse by the public alone does not necessarily cause a trademark to become generic if the primary significance of the term is still to indicate a particular source.\nSome legal experts argue that, like the once-trademarked terms \"aspirin\" and \"yo-yo,\" the term \"superhero\" now primarily refers to a general type of character with extraordinary abilities, rather than characters originating from specific publishers.\nSuperhero names: public domain vs. trademark.\nEven when characters enter the public domain, their names are not always free for use. A notable example is the character Daredevil, originally created by Jack Binder and Jack Cole for Lev Gleason Publications. Although his classic version is in the public domain, Marvel holds the trademark for the name \u201cDaredevil,\u201d associated with its own character introduced in 1964. This prevents third parties from commercially using the name. Under U.S. law at the time, publishers were required to renew their copyrights after 28 years.\nMinority superheroes.\nIn keeping with their origins as representing the archetypical hero stock character in 1930s American comics, superheroes are predominantly depicted as White American middle- or upper-class young adult males and females who are typically tall, athletic, educated, physically attractive and in perfect health. Beginning in the 1960s with the civil rights movement in the United States, and increasingly with the rising concern over political correctness in the 1980s, superhero fiction centered on cultural, ethnic, national, racial and language minority groups (from the perspective of US demographics) began to be produced. This began with depiction of black superheroes in the 1960s, followed in the 1970s with a number of other ethnic-minority superheroes. In keeping with the political mood of the time, cultural diversity and inclusivism would be an important part of superhero groups starting from the 1980s. In the 1990s, this was further augmented by the first depictions of superheroes as homosexual. In 2017, Sign Gene emerged, the first group of deaf superheroes with superpowers through the use of sign language.\nFemale superheroes and villains.\nFemale super heroes\u2014and villains\u2014have been around since the early years of comic books dating back to the 1940s. The representation of women in comic books has been questioned in the past decade following the rise of comic book characters in the film industry (Marvel/DC movies). Women are presented differently than their male counterparts, typically wearing revealing clothing that showcases their curves and cleavage and showing a lot of skin in some cases. Heroes like Power Girl and Wonder Woman are portrayed wearing little clothing and showing cleavage. Power Girl is portrayed as wearing a suit not unlike the swimsuits in the T.V. show \"Baywatch\". The sexualization of women in comic books can be explained mainly by the fact that the majority of writers are male. Not only are the writers mostly male, but the audience is mostly male as well. Therefore, writers are designing characters to appeal to a mostly male audience. The super hero characters illustrate a sociological idea called the \"male gaze\" which is media created from the viewpoint of a normative heterosexual male. The female characters in comic books are used to satisfy male desire for the \"ideal\" woman (small waist, large breasts, toned, athletic body). These characters have god-like power, but the most easily identifiable feature is their hyper sexualized bodies: they are designed to be sexually pleasing to the hypothetical heteronormative male audience.\nVillains, such as Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy, use their sexuality to take advantage of their male victims. In the film versions of these characters, their sexuality and seductive methods are highlighted. Poison Ivy uses seduction through poison to take over the minds of her victims as seen in the 1997 film \"Batman and Robin\". Harley Quinn in 2016's \"Suicide Squad\" uses her sexuality to her advantage, acting in a promiscuous manner.\nThrough the overdeveloped bodies of the heroes or the seductive mannerisms of the villains, women in comic books are used as subordinates to their male counterparts, regardless of their strength or power. Wonder Woman has been subject to a long history of suppression as a result of her strength and power, including American culture's undoing of the Lynda Carter television series. In 2017's \"Wonder Woman\", she had the power of a god, but was still drawn to a much weaker, mortal male character. This can be explained by the sociological concept \"feminine apologetic,\" which reinforces a woman's femininity to account for her masculine attributes (strength, individualism, toughness, aggressiveness, bravery). Women in comic books are considered to be misrepresented due to being created by men, for men.\nThe Hawkeye Initiative is a website satirizing the sexualized portrayal of women in comics by recreating the same poses using male superheroes, especially Marvel's Hawkeye.\nEthnic and religious minorities.\nIn 1966, Marvel introduced the Black Panther, an African monarch who became the first non-caricatured black superhero. The first African-American superhero, the Falcon, followed in 1969, and three years later, Luke Cage, a self-styled \"hero-for-hire\", became the first black superhero to star in his own series. In 1989, the Monica Rambeau incarnation of Captain Marvel was the first female black superhero from a major publisher to get her own title in a special one-shot issue. Before them, a few characters appeared during the Golden Age of Comics, but they are not generally considered superheroes in the modern sense, such as the characters featured in the one-shot \"All-Negro Comics\" #1 (1947), Waku, Prince of the Bantu, introduced by Marvel\u2019s 1950s predecessor Atlas Comics, who starred in his own feature in the anthology series \"Jungle Tales.\" and Kismet, Man of Fate, a Muslim Algerian hero who debuted in 1944 and is considered one of the first Muslim superheroes in comic book history. In 1971, Red Wolf became the first Native American in the superheroic tradition to headline a series. In 1973, Shang-Chi became the first prominent Asian superhero to star in an American comic book. Kato, from the \"Green Hornet\" franchise, had existed as a secondary character since the 1930s. The Green Turtle, created in 1944 by Chinese-American artist Chu F. Hing, was originally conceived as a Chinese hero fighting against the Japanese invasion. However, Hing was prevented by his editors from making the character explicitly Chinese, so he deliberately left the hero\u2019s identity ambiguous.\nKitty Pryde, a member of the X-Men, was an openly Jewish superhero in mainstream American comic books as early as 1978.\nComic-book companies were in the early stages of cultural expansion and many of these characters played to specific stereotypes; Cage and many of his contemporaries often employed lingo similar to that of blaxploitation films, Native Americans were often associated with shamanism and wild animals, and Asian Americans were often portrayed as kung fu martial artists. Subsequent minority heroes, such as the X-Men's Storm and the Teen Titans' Cyborg avoided such conventions; they were both part of ensemble teams, which became increasingly diverse in subsequent years. The X-Men, in particular, were revived in 1975 with a line-up of characters drawn from several nations, including the Kenyan Storm, German Nightcrawler, Soviet/Russian Colossus, Irish Banshee, and Japanese Sunfire. In 1993, Milestone Comics, an African-American-owned media/publishing company entered into a publishing agreement with DC Comics that allowed them to introduce a line of comics that included characters of many ethnic minorities. Milestone's initial run lasted four years, during which it introduced \"Static,\" a character adapted into the WB Network animated series \"Static Shock\".\nIn addition to the creation of new minority heroes, publishers have filled the identities and roles of once-Caucasian heroes with new characters from minority backgrounds. The African-American John Stewart appeared in the 1970s as an alternate for Earth's Green Lantern Hal Jordan, and would become a regular member of the Green Lantern Corps from the 1980s onward. The creators of the 2000s-era \"Justice League\" animated series selected Stewart as the show's Green Lantern. In the Ultimate Marvel universe, Miles Morales, a youth of Puerto Rican and African-American ancestry who was also bitten by a genetically-altered spider, debuted as after the apparent death of the original Spider-Man, Peter Parker. Kamala Khan, a Pakistani-American Muslim teenager who is revealed to have Inhuman lineage after her shapeshifting powers manifested, takes on the identity of Ms. Marvel in 2014 after Carol Danvers had become Captain Marvel. Her self-titled comic book series became a cultural phenomenon, with extensive media coverage by CNN, the New York Times and The Colbert Report, and embraced by anti-Islamophobia campaigners in San Francisco who plastered over anti-Muslim bus adverts with Kamala stickers. Other such successor-heroes of color include James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes as Iron Man and to a lesser extent Riri \"Ironheart\" Williams, Ryan Choi as the Atom, Jaime Reyes as Blue Beetle and Amadeus Cho as Hulk.\nCertain established characters have had their ethnicity changed when adapted to another continuity or media. A notable example is Nick Fury, who is reinterpreted as African-American both in the Ultimate Marvel as well as the Marvel Cinematic Universe continuities.\nSexual orientation and gender identity.\nIn 1992, Marvel revealed that Northstar, a member of the Canadian mutant superhero team Alpha Flight, was homosexual, after years of implication. This ended a long-standing editorial mandate that there would be no homosexual characters in Marvel comics. Although some minor secondary characters in DC Comics' mature-audience 1980s miniseries \"Watchmen\" were gay, and the reformed supervillain Pied Piper came out to Wally West in an issue of \"The Flash\" in 1991, Northstar is considered to be the first openly gay superhero appearing in mainstream comic books. From the mid-2000s onward, several established Marvel and DC comics characters (or a variant version of the pre-existing character) were outed or reintroduced as LGBT individuals by both publishers. Examples include the Mikaal Tomas incarnation of Starman in 1998; Colossus in the Ultimate X-Men series; Renee Montoya in DC's \"Gotham Central\" series in 2003; the Kate Kane incarnation of Batwoman in 2006; Rictor and Shatterstar in an issue of X-Factor in 2009; the Golden Age Green Lantern Alan Scott is reimagined as openly gay following The New 52 reboot in 2011; and in 2015, a younger time displaced version of Iceman in an issue of \"All-New X-Men\".\nMany new openly gay, lesbian and bisexual characters have since emerged in superhero fiction, such as Gen13's Rainmaker, Apollo and Midnighter of The Authority, and Wiccan and Hulkling of the Young Avengers. Notable transgender or gender bending characters are fewer in number by comparison: the alter ego of superheroine Zsazsa Zaturnnah, a seminal character in Philippine popular culture, is an effeminate gay man who transforms into a female superhuman after ingesting a magical stone. Desire from Neil Gaiman's \"The Sandman\" series, Cloud from Defenders, and Xavin from the Runaways are all characters who could (and often) change their gender at will. Alysia Yeoh, a supporting character created by writer Gail Simone for the Batgirl ongoing series published by DC Comics, received substantial media attention in 2011 for being the first major transgender character written in a contemporary context in a mainstream American comic book.\nThe \"Sailor Moon\" series is known for featuring a substantial number of openly LGBT characters since its inception, as Japan have traditionally been more open about portraying homosexuality in its children's media compared to many countries in the West. Certain characters who are presented as homosexual or transgender in one continuity may not be presented as such in others, particularly with dubbed versions made for international release.\nAn animated short \"The Ambiguously Gay Duo\" parodies comic book superheroes and features Ace and Gary (Stephen Colbert, Steve Carell). It originated on \"The Dana Carvey Show\" and then moved to \"Saturday Night Live\".\nLanguage minority.\nIn 2017, Pluin introduced \"Sign Gene\", a film featuring a group of deaf superheroes whose powers derive from their use of sign language. The film was produced by and with deaf people and deals with Deaf culture, history and language.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "43078", "revid": "49920", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43078", "title": "Interleaf", "text": "Defunct software company\nInterleaf, Inc. was a company that created computer software products for the technical publishing creation and distribution process. Founded in 1981, its initial product was the first commercial document processor that integrated text and graphics editing, producing WYSIWYG (\"what you see is what you get\") output at near-typeset quality. It also had early products in the document management, electronic publishing, and Web publishing spaces. Interleaf's \"Active Documents\" functionality, integrated into its text and graphics editing products in the early 1990s, was the first to give document creators programmatic access (via LISP) to virtually all of the document's elements, structures, and software capabilities.\nBroadvision acquired Interleaf in January 2000, and Aurea Software Inc. acquired Broadvision in May 2020.\nInterleaf's headquarters was in Cambridge, Massachusetts, US, and later moved to Waltham, Massachusetts.\nHistory.\nInterleaf was founded by David Boucher and Harry George in 1981. Boucher served as chief executive officer from 1981 until 1992; George served as chief financial officer. Earlier, both were among the founders of Kurzweil Computer Products. Significant technology came from MIT's Office Automation Group led by Michael Hammer, a member of Interleaf's board of directors; Bahram (Bern) Niamir, who had been in that group, brought many ideas from its \"Etude\" system, a pioneering WYSIWYG editor. Other early personnel came from NBI, Inc. and Wang Labs. The company initially produced \"turnkey\" systems, that is, combinations of hardware and software integrated by the company. It initially ran on workstations from Sun Microsystems and Apollo Computers, but later ported its software to workstations made by Digital Equipment Corporation, HP, IBM and SGI, and later still, to the Apple Macintosh II and the IBM Personal Computer.\nInterleaf sold its first products in 1984-5. Inspired by the Xerox Star and Apple Lisa, TPS (Technical Publishing Software) uniquely enabled authors to write their text and create technical graphics on a computer screen that showed what the page would look like when formatted and printed on a laser printer. This capability was so unusual in 1985 that the company's name referred to the \"interleaving\" of text and graphics. WYSIWYG editing was also new, as existing typesetting systems were text-based and relied on user markup and batch processing to produce the end result. TPS was also noted for its ability to handle the sorts of long documents corporate technical publishing departments routinely created.\nInterleaf had its initial public offering (IPO) in June 1986, raising $24.6 million.\nIn 1990, Interleaf moved from Cambridge to Waltham, MA.\nThe company was bought by Broadvision in 2000, which renamed its authoring products \"Quicksilver\". The availability of Quicksilver 3.0 was announced in March 2007. The availability of QuickSilver 3.5 was announced in May 2010. QuickSilver 3.7 was released in July 2014. Quicksilver is currently sold and supported by Aurea Software, Inc.\nConversion.\nThere remain engineering companies and defense contractors that have their archives in the Interleaf/Quicksilver format, however in the 2000s it became increasingly difficult and expensive to maintain documents in that format, thus, established users of Quicksilver and the original Interleaf often seek to convert their documents to another format, usually Microsoft Word because of its ubiquity in large corporations.\nBecause of the aging of the Interleaf/Quicksilver code, by the early 2000s there were few technical options to convert Interleaf/Quicksilver documents. One option is to retype the entire document manually. This is only cost effective using labor in countries with low labor costs like China and the Philippines, however, in any case, a manual conversion process has high risks of human contamination of data.\nBased on a web search, there appear to have been few software based, programmatic conversion services for Interleaf/Quicksilver. By 2023, we found only one such service in the marketplace: ZANDAR Corporation's TagWrite, that claims to have the ability to make precise, programmatic conversion of Interleaf/Quicksilver entirely in computer memory without human intervention.\nProducts.\nTPS.\nTPS (later renamed to \"Interleaf 5,\" up through \"Interleaf 7\") was an integrated, networked text-and-graphics document creation system initially designed for technical publishing departments. Versions after its first release in 1984 added instantaneous updating of page numbering and reference numbers through multi-chapter and multi-volumes sets, increased graphics capabilities, automatic index and table of content generation, hyphenation, equations, \"microdocuments\" that recursively allowed fully functional whole document elements to be embedded in any document, and the ability to program any element of a document (a capability the company called \"Active Documents\"). Interleaf software was available in many languages including Japanese text layout.\nTPS was a structured document editor. That is, it internally treated a document as a set of element classes, each with its own set of properties. Classes might include common document elements such as a body, paragraphs, titles, subheadings, captions, etc. Authors were free to create any set of elements and save them as a reusable template. The properties of a class \u2014 its font size, for example \u2014 could be changed and automatically applied to every instance of that class. If this caused a change in pagination \u2014 increasing the font size could change where the page breaks were \u2014 the software would update the screen quickly enough for the author to continue typing, including altering all of the cross-references that the author may have inserted; this WYSIWYG capability was a competitive advantage for the company. The structured nature of the documents also enabled TPS to provide \"conditional document assembly\", a feature that enabled users to \"tag\" document elements with metadata about them, and then automatically assemble versions of the document based upon those tags. For example, an aircraft manufacturer might tag paragraphs with the model number of the planes to which they applied and then assemble versions of the documentation specific to each model.\nThe fact that it created structured documents enabled Interleaf to add its Active Document capabilities in the early 1990s. Just as JavaScript enables contemporary software developers to add functionality and \"intelligence\" to Web documents, Interleaf used LISP to enable document authors and engineers to enhance its authoring electronic publishing systems. Any document element could be given new \"methods\" (capabilities), and could respond to changes in the content or structure of the document itself. Typical applications included documents that automatically generated and updated charts based upon data expressed in the document, pages that altered themselves based on data accessed from databases or other sources, and systems that dynamically created pages to guide users through complex processes such as filling out insurance forms.\nInterleaf Relational Document Manager (RDM).\nRDM was an early document management product, acquired in the late 1980s and then integrated with Interleaf's other products. RDM used a relational database management system to manage the elements of complex document sets, including their versions. Team of authors and editors would \"check in\" their documents when done with a work session, and begin a new session by \"checking them out.\" In so doing, RDM would ensure that the authors were working on the most current version of the document, even if another author had worked on it in the interim.\nInterleaf WorldView.\nInterleaf Worldview's core functionality is familiar to users of Adobe Acrobat Reader and other Portable Document Format (PDF) viewers, although Worldview preceded it by a year Worldview allowed document sets created with Interleaf's technical publishing tools to be viewed on workstations, Macintoshes, and PCs, retaining page fidelity, and including hyperlinks among the pages\nInterleaf WorldView Press.\nWorldview Press prepared documents for online viewing via Worldview. It imported documents created not only with Interleaf's systems but by the other major document creation and graphic systems of the time, including Microsoft Word, PostScript, TIFF and SGML. Using Interleaf's technical publishing system's ability to reformat documents rapidly, Worldview Press enabled the creation of documents formatted for particular delivery vehicles. For example, the same documents could be formatted for reading on a small laptop screen or for a large workstation's monitor. WorldView Press, developed in Lisp, was conceived and implemented by Jim Giza.\nInterleaf Cyberleaf.\nAs the World Wide Web became increasingly adopted as the preferred mechanism for distributing electronic documents, Interleaf added Cyberleaf, a version of the WorldView Press that produced HTML documents.\nBill O'Donnell was the designer and developer of Cyberleaf. Later versions were worked on by Brenda White.\nCompetitors.\nIn the technical authoring and publishing area, Framemaker and Ventura Publisher became major competitors.\nIn the document management area, Interleaf competed with Documentum.\nIn the electronic distribution area, Adobe Acrobat, launched after Interleaf Worldview, became the dominant software.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "43079", "revid": "50895460", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43079", "title": "One Thousand and One Nights", "text": "Collection of Middle Eastern folk tales\nOne Thousand and One Nights (, ) is a collection of Middle Eastern folktales compiled in the Arabic language during the Islamic Golden Age. It is often known in English as The Arabian Nights, from the first English-language edition (c.\u20091706\u20131721), which rendered the title as The Arabian Nights' Entertainments.\nThe work was collected over many centuries by various authors, translators, and scholars across West Asia, Central Asia, South Asia, and North Africa. Some tales trace their roots back to ancient and medieval Arabic, Persian, and Mesopotamian literature. Most tales, however, were originally folk stories from the Abbasid and Mamluk eras, while others, especially the frame story, are probably drawn from the Pahlavi Persian work (, lit.\u2009'A Thousand Tales'), which in turn relied partly on Indian elements.\nCommon to all the editions of the \"Nights\" is the framing device of the story of the ruler Shahryar being narrated the tales by his wife Scheherazade, with one tale told over each night of storytelling. The stories proceed from this original tale; some are framed within other tales, while some are self-contained. Some editions contain only a few hundred nights of storytelling, while others include 1001 or more. The bulk of the text is in prose, although verse is occasionally used for songs and riddles and to express heightened emotion. Most of the poems are single couplets or quatrains, although some are longer.\nSome of the stories commonly associated with the \"Arabian Nights\"\u2014particularly \"Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp\" and \"Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves\"\u2014were not part of the collection in the original Arabic versions, but were instead added to the collection by French translator Antoine Galland after he heard them from Syrian writer Hanna Diyab during the latter's visit to Paris. Other stories, such as \"The Seven Voyages of Sinbad the Sailor\", had an independent existence before being added to the collection.\nSynopsis.\nThe main frame story concerns Shahry\u0101r, a king who ruled an empire that stretched from Persia to India. The story begins with Zaman, the brother of Shahry\u0101r, setting out on a journey to visit his brother at his palace. Early in the preparations, he remembers that he's left something inside his own palace, and returns to retrieve it\u2014only to find that his wife has been making love to a black cook in their own bed. He kills them both, and continues on his journey, keeping the event a secret. Coincidentally, Shahry\u0101r finds that his own wife, as well as his numerous slave girls, have been engaging in secret orgies with black men. Shahry\u0101r has his wife killed. In his bitterness and grief, he decides that all women are the same. Shahry\u0101r begins to marry a succession of virgins only to execute each one the next morning, before she has a chance to dishonor him.\nEventually, the Vizier (Wazir), whose duty it is to provide them, cannot find any more virgins. Scheherazade, the vizier's daughter, offers herself as the next bride and her father reluctantly agrees. On the night of their marriage, Scheherazade begins to tell the king a tale, but does not end it. The king, curious about how the story ends, is thus forced to postpone her execution in order to hear the conclusion. The next night, as soon as she finishes the tale, she begins another one, and the king, eager to hear the conclusion of that tale as well, postpones her execution once again. This goes on for one thousand and one nights, hence the name.\nThe tales vary widely: they include historical tales, love stories, tragedies, comedies, poems, burlesques, and various forms of erotica. Numerous stories depict jinn, ghouls, ape people, sorcerers, magicians, and legendary places, which are often intermingled with real people and geography, not always rationally. Common protagonists include the historical Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid, his Grand Vizier, Jafar al-Barmaki, and the famous poet Abu Nuwas, despite the fact that these figures lived some 200 years after the fall of the Sassanid Empire, in which the frame tale of Scheherazade is set. Sometimes a character in Scheherazade's tale will begin telling other characters a story of their own, and that story may have another one told within it, resulting in a richly layered narrative texture.\nVersions differ, at least in detail, as to final endings (in some Scheherazade asks for a pardon, in some the king sees their children and decides not to execute his wife, in some other things happen that make the king distracted) but they all end with the king giving his wife a pardon and sparing her life.\nThe narrator's standards for what constitutes a cliffhanger seem broader than in modern literature. While in many cases a story is cut off with the hero in danger of losing their life or another kind of deep trouble, in some parts of the full text Scheherazade stops her narration in the middle of an exposition of abstract philosophical principles or complex points of Islamic philosophy, and in one case during a detailed description of human anatomy according to Galen\u2014and in all of these cases she turns out to be justified in her belief that the king's curiosity about the sequel would buy her another day of life.\nA number of stories within the \"One Thousand and One Nights\" also feature science fiction elements. One example is \"The Adventures of Bulukiya\", where the protagonist Bulukiya's quest for the herb of immortality leads him to explore the seas, journey to the Garden of Eden and to Jahannam, and travel across the cosmos to different worlds much larger than his own world, anticipating elements of galactic science fiction; along the way, he encounters societies of jinns, mermaids, talking serpents, talking trees, and other forms of life. In another \"Arabian Nights\" tale, the protagonist Abdullah the Fisherman gains the ability to breathe underwater and discovers an underwater submarine society that is portrayed as an inverted reflection of society on land, in that the underwater society follows a form of primitive communism where concepts like money and clothing do not exist. Other \"Arabian Nights\" tales deal with lost ancient technologies, advanced ancient civilizations that went astray, and catastrophes which overwhelmed them. \"The City of Brass\" features a group of travellers on an archaeological expedition across the Sahara to find an ancient lost city and attempt to recover a brass vessel that Solomon once used to trap a jinn, and, along the way, encounter a mummified queen, petrified inhabitants, life-like humanoid robots and automata, seductive marionettes dancing without strings, and a brass horseman robot who directs the party towards the ancient city. \"The Ebony Horse\" features a robot in the form of a flying mechanical horse controlled using keys that could fly into outer space and towards the Sun, while the \"Third Qalandar's Tale\" also features a robot in the form of an uncanny boatman. \"The City of Brass\" and \"The Ebony Horse\" can be considered early examples of proto-science fiction.\nHistory, versions and translations.\nThe history of the \"Nights\" is extremely complex and modern scholars have made many attempts to untangle the story of how the collection as it currently exists came about. Robert Irwin summarises their findings:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In the 1880s and 1890s a lot of work was done on the \"Nights\" by Zotenberg and others, in the course of which a consensus view of the history of the text emerged. Most scholars agreed that the Nights was a composite work and that the earliest tales in it came from India and Persia. At some time, probably in the early eighth century, these tales were translated into Arabic under the title \"Alf Layla\", or 'The Thousand Nights'. This collection then formed the basis of \"The Thousand and One Nights\". The original core of stories was quite small. Then, in Iraq in the ninth or tenth century, this original core had Arab stories added to it\u2014among them some tales about the Caliph Harun al-Rashid. Also, perhaps from the tenth century onwards, previously independent sagas and story cycles were added to the compilation [...] Then, from the 13th century onwards, a further layer of stories was added in Syria and Egypt, many of these showing a preoccupation with sex, magic or low life. In the early modern period yet more stories were added to the Egyptian collections so as to swell the bulk of the text sufficiently to bring its length up to the full 1,001 nights of storytelling promised by the book's title.\nPossible Indian influence.\nDevices found in Sanskrit literature such as frame stories and animal fables are seen by some scholars as lying at the root of the conception of the \"Nights\". The motif of the wise young woman who delays and finally removes an impending danger by telling stories has been traced back to Indian sources. Indian folklore is represented in the \"Nights\" by certain animal stories, which reflect influence from ancient Sanskrit fables. The influence of the \"Panchatantra\" and \"Baital Pachisi\" is particularly notable.\nIt is possible that the influence of the \"Panchatantra\" is via a Sanskrit adaptation called the \"Tantropakhyana\". Only fragments of the original Sanskrit form of the \"Tantropakhyana\" survive, but translations or adaptations exist in Tamil, Lao, Thai, and Old Javanese. The frame story follows the broad outline of a concubine telling stories in order to maintain the interest and favour of a king\u2014although the basis of the collection of stories is from the \"Panchatantra\"\u2014with its original Indian setting.\nThe \"Panchatantra\" and various tales from \"Jatakas\" were first translated into Persian by Borz\u016bya in 570 CE; they were later translated into Arabic by Ibn al-Muqaffa in 750 CE. The Arabic version was translated into several languages, including Syriac, Greek, Hebrew and Spanish.\nPersian prototype:.\nThe earliest mentions of the \"Nights\" refer to it as an Arabic translation from a Persian book, (also known as \"Afsaneh\" or \"Afsana\"), meaning 'The Thousand Stories'. In the tenth century, Ibn al-Nadim compiled a catalogue of books (the \"Fihrist\") in Baghdad. He noted that the Sassanid kings of Iran enjoyed \"evening tales and fables\". Al-Nadim then writes about the Persian , explaining the frame story it employs: a bloodthirsty king kills off a succession of wives after their wedding night. Eventually one has the intelligence to save herself by telling him a story every evening, leaving each tale unfinished until the next night so that the king will delay her execution.\nHowever, according to al-Nadim, the book contains only 200 stories. He also writes disparagingly of the collection's literary quality, observing that \"it is truly a coarse book, without warmth in the telling\". In the same century Al-Masudi also refers to the , saying the Arabic translation is called ('A Thousand Entertaining Tales'), but is generally known as ('A Thousand Nights'). He mentions the characters Shir\u0101zd (Scheherazade) and Din\u0101z\u0101d.\nNo physical evidence of the has survived, so its exact relationship with the existing later Arabic versions remains a mystery. Apart from the Scheherazade frame story, several other tales have Persian origins, although it is unclear how they entered the collection. These stories include the cycle of \"King Jali'ad and his Wazir Shimas\" and \"The Ten Wazirs or the History of King Azadbakht and his Son\" (derived from the seventh-century Persian ).\nIn the 1950s, the Iraqi scholar Safa Khulusi suggested (on internal rather than historical evidence) that the Persian writer Ibn al-Muqaffa' was responsible for the first Arabic translation of the frame story and some of the Persian stories later incorporated into the Nights. This would place genesis of the collection in the eighth century.\nEvolving Arabic versions.\nIn the mid-20th century, the scholar Nabia Abbott found a document with a few lines of an Arabic work with the title \"The Book of the Tale of a Thousand Nights\", dating from the ninth century. This is the earliest known surviving fragment of the \"Nights\". The first reference to the Arabic version under its full title \"The One Thousand and One Nights\" appears in Cairo in the 12th century. Professor Dwight Reynolds describes the subsequent transformations of the Arabic version:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Some of the earlier Persian tales may have survived within the Arabic tradition altered such that Arabic Muslim names and new locations were substituted for pre-Islamic Persian ones, but it is also clear that whole cycles of Arabic tales were eventually added to the collection and apparently replaced most of the Persian materials. One such cycle of Arabic tales centres around a small group of historical figures from ninth-century Baghdad, including the caliph Harun al-Rashid (died 809), his vizier Jafar al-Barmaki (d. 803) and the licentious poet Abu Nuwas (d. c. 813). Another cluster is a body of stories from late medieval Cairo in which are mentioned persons and places that date to as late as the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.\nTwo main Arabic manuscript traditions of the Nights are known: the Syrian and the Egyptian. The Syrian tradition is primarily represented by the earliest extensive manuscript of the \"Nights\", the Galland Manuscript written sometime between AD 1450 and 1593. It and surviving copies of it are much shorter and include fewer tales than the Egyptian tradition. It is represented in print by the so-called \"Calcutta I\" (1814\u20131818) and most notably by the 'Leiden edition' (1984). The Leiden Edition, prepared by Muhsin Mahdi, is the only critical edition of 1001 Nights to date, believed to be most stylistically faithful representation of medieval Arabic versions currently available.\nTexts of the Egyptian tradition emerge later and contain many more tales of much more varied content; a much larger number of originally independent tales have been incorporated into the collection over the centuries, most of them after the Galland manuscript was written, and were being included as late as in the 18th and 19th centuries.\nAll extant substantial versions of both recensions share a small common core of tales:\nThe texts of the Syrian recension do not contain much beside that core. It is debated which of the Arabic recensions is more \"authentic\" and closer to the original: the Egyptian ones have been modified more extensively and more recently, and scholars such as Muhsin Mahdi have suspected that this was caused in part by European demand for a \"complete version\"; but it appears that this type of modification has been common throughout the history of the collection, and independent tales have always been added to it.\nPrinted Arabic editions.\nThe first printed Arabic-language edition of the \"One Thousand and One Nights\" was published in 1775. It contained an Egyptian version of \"The Nights\" known as \"ZER\" (Zotenberg's Egyptian Recension) and 200 tales. No copy of this edition survives, but it was the basis for an 1835 edition by Bulaq, published by the Egyptian government.\nThe \"Nights\" were next printed in Arabic in two volumes in Calcutta by the British East India Company in 1814\u20131818. Each volume contained one hundred tales.\nSoon after, the Prussian scholar Christian Maximilian Habicht collaborated with the Tunisian Mordecai ibn al-Najjar to create an edition containing 1001 nights both in the original Arabic and in German translation, initially in a series of eight volumes published in Breslau in 1825\u20131838. A further four volumes followed in 1842\u20131843. In addition to the Galland manuscript, Habicht and al-Najjar used what they believed to be a Tunisian manuscript, which was later revealed as a forgery by al-Najjar.\nBoth the ZER printing and Habicht and al-Najjar's edition influenced the next printing, a four-volume edition also from Calcutta (known as the \"Macnaghten\" or \"Calcutta II\" edition). This claimed to be based on an older Egyptian manuscript (which has never been found).\nA major recent edition, which reverts to the Syrian recension, is a critical edition based on the fourteenth- or fifteenth-century Syrian manuscript in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, originally used by Galland. This edition, known as the Leiden text, was compiled in Arabic by Muhsin Mahdi (1984\u20131994). Mahdi argued that this version is the earliest extant one (a view that is largely accepted today) and that it reflects most closely a \"definitive\" coherent text ancestral to all others that he believed to have existed during the Mamluk period (a view that remains contentious). Still, even scholars who deny this version the exclusive status of \"the only \"real\" Arabian Nights\" recognize it as being the best source on the original \"style\" and linguistic form of the medieval work.\nIn 1997, a further Arabic edition appeared, containing tales from the Arabian Nights transcribed from a seventeenth-century manuscript in the Egyptian dialect of Arabic.\nModern translations.\nThe first European version (1704\u20131717) was translated into French by Antoine Galland from an Arabic text of the Syrian recension and other sources. This 12-volume work, \"Les Mille et une nuits, contes arabes traduits en fran\u00e7ais\" ('The Thousand and one nights, Arab stories translated into French'), included stories that were not in the original Arabic manuscript. \"Aladdin's Lamp\", and \"Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves\" (as well as several other lesser-known tales) appeared first in Galland's translation and cannot be found in any of the original manuscripts. He wrote that he heard them from the Christian Maronite storyteller Hanna Diab during Diab's visit to Paris. Galland's version of the \"Nights\" was immensely popular throughout Europe, and later versions were issued by Galland's publisher using Galland's name without his consent.\nAs scholars were looking for the presumed \"complete\" and \"original\" form of the Nights, they naturally turned to the more voluminous texts of the Egyptian recension, which soon came to be viewed as the \"standard version\". The first translations of this kind, such as that of Edward Lane (1840, 1859), were bowdlerized. Unabridged and unexpurgated translations were made, first by John Payne, under the title \"The Book of the Thousand Nights and One Night\" (1882, nine volumes), and then by Sir Richard Francis Burton, entitled \"The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night\" (1885, ten volumes)\u00a0\u2013 the latter was, according to some assessments, partially based on the former, leading to charges of plagiarism.\nIn view of the sexual imagery in the source texts (which Burton emphasized even further, especially by adding extensive footnotes and appendices on Oriental sexual mores) and the strict Victorian laws on obscene material, both of these translations were printed as private editions for subscribers only, rather than published in the usual manner. Burton's original 10 volumes were followed by a further six (seven in the Baghdad Edition and perhaps others) entitled \"The Supplemental Nights to the Thousand Nights and a Night\", which were printed between 1886 and 1888. It has, however, been criticized for its \"archaic language and extravagant idiom\" and \"obsessive focus on sexuality\" (and has even been called an \"eccentric ego-trip\" and a \"highly personal reworking of the text\").\nLater versions of the \"Nights\" include that of the French doctor J. C. Mardrus, issued from 1898 to 1904. It was translated into English by Powys Mathers, and issued in 1923. Like Payne's and Burton's texts, it is based on the Egyptian recension and retains the erotic material, indeed expanding on it, but it has been criticized for inaccuracy.\nMuhsin Mahdi's 1984 Leiden edition, based on the Galland Manuscript, was rendered into English by Husain Haddawy (1990). This translation has been praised as \"very readable\" and \"strongly recommended for anyone who wishes to taste the authentic flavour of those tales\". An additional second volume of \"Arabian nights\" translated by Haddawy, composed of popular tales \"not\" present in the Leiden edition, was published in 1995. Both volumes were the basis for a single-volume reprint of selected tales of Haddawy's translations.\nA new English translation was published by Penguin Classics in three volumes in 2008. It is translated by Malcolm C. Lyons and Ursula Lyons with introduction and annotations by Robert Irwin. This is the first complete translation of the Macnaghten or Calcutta II edition (Egyptian recension) since Burton's. It contains, in addition to the standard text of 1001 Nights, the so-called \"orphan stories\" of \"Aladdin\" and \"Ali Baba\" as well as an alternative ending to \"The seventh journey of Sindbad\" from Antoine Galland's original French. As the translator himself notes in his preface to the three volumes, \"[N]o attempt has been made to superimpose on the translation changes that would be needed to 'rectify' ... accretions, ... repetitions, non sequiturs and confusions that mark the present text,\" and the work is a \"representation of what is primarily oral literature, appealing to the ear rather than the eye\". The Lyons translation includes all the poetry (in plain prose paraphrase) but does not attempt to reproduce in English the internal rhyming of some prose sections of the original Arabic. Moreover, it streamlines somewhat and has cuts. In this sense it is not, as claimed, a complete translation. This translation was generally well-received upon release.\nA new English language translation was published in December 2021, the first solely by a female author, Yasmine Seale, which removes earlier sexist and racist references. The new translation includes all the tales from Hanna Diyab and additionally includes stories previously omitted featuring female protagonists, such as tales about Parizade, Pari Banu, and the horror story Sidi Numan.\nTimeline.\nScholars have assembled a timeline concerning the publication history of \"The Nights\":\nLiterary themes and techniques.\nThe \"One Thousand and One Nights\" and various tales within it make use of many innovative literary techniques, which the storytellers of the tales rely on for increased drama, suspense, or other emotions. Some of these date back to earlier Persian, Indian and Arabic literature, while others were original to the \"One Thousand and One Nights\".\nFrame story.\nThe \"One Thousand and One Nights\" employs an early example of the frame story, or framing device: the character Scheherazade narrates a set of tales (most often fairy tales) to the Sultan Shahriyar over many nights. Many of Scheherazade's tales are themselves frame stories, such as the \"Tale of Sinbad the Seaman and Sinbad the Landsman\", which is a collection of adventures related by Sinbad the Seaman to Sinbad the Landsman.\nIn folkloristics, the frame story is classified as ATU 875B*, \"Storytelling Saves a Wife from Death\".\nEmbedded narrative.\nAnother technique featured in the \"One Thousand and One Nights\" is an early example of the \"story within a story\", or \"embedded narrative\" technique: this can be traced back to earlier Persian and Indian storytelling traditions, most notably the \"Panchatantra\" of ancient Sanskrit literature. The \"Nights\", however, improved on the \"Panchatantra\" in several ways, particularly in the way a story is introduced. In the \"Panchatantra\", stories are introduced as didactic analogies, with the frame story referring to these stories with variants of the phrase \"If you're not careful, that which happened to the louse and the flea will happen to you.\" In the \"Nights\", this didactic framework is the least common way of introducing the story: instead, a story is most commonly introduced through subtle means, particularly as an answer to questions raised in a previous tale.\nThe general story is narrated by an unknown narrator, and in this narration the stories are told by Scheherazade. In most of Scheherazade's narrations there are also stories narrated, and even in some of these, there are some other stories. This is particularly the case for the \"Sinbad the Sailor\" story narrated by Scheherazade in the \"One Thousand and One Nights\". Within the \"Sinbad the Sailor\" story itself, the protagonist Sinbad the Sailor narrates the stories of his seven voyages to Sinbad the Porter. The device is also used to great effect in stories such as \"The Three Apples\" and \"The Seven Viziers\". In yet another tale Scheherazade narrates, \"The Fisherman and the Jinni\", the \"Tale of the Wazir and the Sage Duban\" is narrated within it, and within that there are three more tales narrated.\nDramatic visualization.\nDramatic visualization is \"the representing of an object or character with an abundance of descriptive detail, or the mimetic rendering of gestures and dialogue in such a way as to make a given scene 'visual' or imaginatively present to an audience\". This technique is used in several tales of the \"One Thousand and One Nights\", such as the tale of \"The Three Apples\" (see Crime fiction elements below).\nFate and destiny.\nA common theme in many \"Arabian Nights\" tales is fate and destiny. Italian filmmaker Pier Paolo Pasolini observed:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[E]very tale in \"The Thousand and One Nights\" begins with an 'appearance of destiny' which manifests itself through an anomaly, and one anomaly always generates another. So a chain of anomalies is set up. And the more logical, tightly knit, essential this chain is, the more beautiful the tale. By 'beautiful' I mean vital, absorbing and exhilarating. The chain of anomalies always tends to lead back to normality. The end of every tale in \"The One Thousand and One Nights\" consists of a 'disappearance' of destiny, which sinks back to the somnolence of daily life ... The protagonist of the stories is in fact destiny itself.\nThough invisible, fate may be considered a leading character in the \"One Thousand and One Nights\". The plot devices often used to present this theme are coincidence, reverse causation, and the self-fulfilling prophecy (see Foreshadowing section below). \nForeshadowing.\nEarly examples of the foreshadowing technique of repetitive designation, now known as \"Chekhov's gun\", occur in the \"One Thousand and One Nights\", which contains \"repeated references to some character or object which appears insignificant when first mentioned but which reappears later to intrude suddenly in the narrative.\" A notable example is in the tale of \"The Three Apples\" (see Crime fiction elements below).\nAnother early foreshadowing technique is \"formal patterning\", \"the organization of the events, actions and gestures which constitute a narrative and give shape to a story; when done well, formal patterning allows the audience the pleasure of discerning and anticipating the structure of the plot as it unfolds.\" This technique is also found in \"One Thousand and One Nights\", where it takes the form of a repeating story\u2013cliffhanger\u2013story\u2013cliffhanger pattern.\nThe self-fulfilling prophecy.\nSeveral tales in the \"One Thousand and One Nights\" use the self-fulfilling prophecy, as a special form of literary prolepsis, to foreshadow what is going to happen. This literary device dates back to the story of Krishna in ancient Sanskrit literature, and Oedipus or the death of Heracles in the plays of Sophocles. A variation of this device is the self-fulfilling dream, which can be found in Arabic literature (or the dreams of Joseph and his conflicts with his brothers, in the Hebrew Bible).\nA notable example is \"The Ruined Man who Became Rich Again through a Dream\", in which a man is told in his dream to leave his native city of Baghdad and travel to Cairo, where he will discover the whereabouts of some hidden treasure. The man travels there and experiences misfortune, ending up in jail, where he tells his dream to a police officer. The officer mocks the idea of foreboding dreams and tells the protagonist that he himself had a dream about a house with a courtyard and fountain in Baghdad where treasure is buried under the fountain. The man recognizes the place as his own house and, after he is released from jail, he returns home and digs up the treasure. In other words, the foreboding dream not only predicted the future, but the dream was the cause of its prediction coming true. A variant of this story later appears in English folklore as the \"Pedlar of Swaffham\" and Paulo Coelho's \"The Alchemist\"; Jorge Luis Borges' collection of short stories \"A Universal History of Infamy\" featured his translation of this particular story into Spanish, as \"The Story of the Two Dreamers\".\n\"The Tale of Attaf\" depicts another variation of the self-fulfilling prophecy, whereby Harun al-Rashid consults his library (the House of Wisdom), reads a random book, \"falls to laughing and weeping and dismisses the faithful vizier Ja'far ibn Yahya from sight. Ja'afar, disturbed and upset, flees Baghdad and plunges into a series of adventures in Damascus, involving Attaf and the woman whom Attaf eventually marries\". After returning to Baghdad, Ja'afar reads the same book that caused Harun to laugh and weep, and discovers that it describes his own adventures with Attaf. In other words, it was Harun's reading of the book that provoked the adventures described in the book to take place. This is an early example of reverse causation.\nNear the end of the tale, Attaf is given a death sentence for a crime he did not commit but Harun, knowing the truth from what he has read in the book, prevents this and has Attaf released from prison. In the 12th century, this tale was translated into Latin by Petrus Alphonsi and included in his \"Disciplina Clericalis\", alongside the \"Sindibad\" story cycle. In the 14th century, a version of \"The Tale of Attaf\" also appears in the \"Gesta Romanorum\" and Giovanni Boccaccio's \"The Decameron\".\nRepetition.\n\"Leitwortstil\" is \"the purposeful repetition of words\" in a given literary piece that \"usually expresses a motif or theme important to the given story.\" This device occurs in the \"One Thousand and One Nights\", which binds several tales in a story cycle. The storytellers of the tales relied on this technique \"to shape the constituent members of their story cycles into a coherent whole\".\nAnother technique used in the \"One Thousand and One Nights\" is thematic patterning, which is:[T]he distribution of recurrent thematic concepts and moralistic motifs among the various incidents and frames of a story. In a skillfully crafted tale, thematic patterning may be arranged so as to emphasize the unifying argument or salient idea which disparate events and disparate frames have in common.Several different variants of the \"Cinderella\" story, which has its origins in the ancient Greek story of Rhodopis, appear in the \"One Thousand and One Nights\", including \"The Second Shaykh's Story\", \"The Eldest Lady's Tale\" and \"Abdallah ibn Fadil and His Brothers\", all dealing with the theme of a younger sibling harassed by two jealous elders. In some of these, the siblings are female, while in others they are male. One of the tales, \"Judar and His Brethren\", departs from the happy endings of previous variants and reworks the plot to give it a tragic ending instead, with the younger brother being poisoned by his elder brothers.\nSexual humour.\nThe \"Nights\" contain many examples of sexual humour. Some of this borders on satire, as in the tale called \"Ali with the Large Member\" which pokes fun at the obsession with male genital.\nUnreliable narrator.\nThe literary device of the unreliable narrator was used in several fictional medieval Arabic tales of the \"One Thousand and One Nights\". In one tale, \"The Seven Viziers\" (also known as \"Craft and Malice of Women or The Tale of the King, His Son, His Concubine and the Seven Wazirs\"), a courtesan accuses a king's son of having abused her, when in reality she had failed to rape him (inspired by the Qur'anic/Biblical story of Yusuf/Joseph). Seven viziers attempt to save his life by narrating seven stories to prove the unreliability of women, and the courtesan responds by narrating a story to prove the unreliability of viziers. The unreliable narrator device is also used to generate suspense in \"The Three Apples\" and humor in \"The Hunchback's Tale\" (see Crime fiction elements below).\nGenre elements.\nCrime fiction.\nAn example of the murder mystery and suspense thriller genres in the collection, with multiple plot twists and detective fiction elements was \"The Three Apples\", also known as \"Hikayat al-sabiyya 'l-maqtula\" ('The Tale of the Murdered Young Woman').\nIn this tale, Harun al-Rashid comes to possess a chest, which, when opened, contains the body of a young woman. Harun gives his vizier, Ja'far, three days to find the culprit or be executed. At the end of three days, when Ja'far is about to be executed for his failure, two men come forward, both claiming to be the murderer. As they tell their story it transpires that, although the younger of them, the woman's husband, was responsible for her death, some of the blame attaches to a slave, who had taken one of the apples mentioned in the title and caused the woman's murder.\nHarun then gives Ja'far three more days to find the guilty slave. When he yet again fails to find the culprit, and bids his family goodbye before his execution, he discovers by chance his daughter has the apple, which she obtained from Ja'far's own slave, Rayhan. Thus the mystery is solved.\nAnother \"Nights\" tale with crime fiction elements was \"The Hunchback's Tale\" story cycle which, unlike \"The Three Apples\", was more of a suspenseful comedy and courtroom drama rather than a murder mystery or detective fiction. The story is set in a fictional China and begins with a hunchback, the emperor's favourite comedian, being invited to dinner by a tailor couple. The hunchback accidentally chokes on his food from laughing too hard and the couple, fearful that the emperor will be furious, take his body to a Jewish doctor's clinic and leave him there. This leads to the next tale in the cycle, the \"Tale of the Jewish Doctor\", where the doctor accidentally trips over the hunchback's body, falls down the stairs with him, and finds him dead, leading him to believe that the fall had killed him. The doctor then dumps his body down a chimney, and this leads to yet another tale in the cycle, which continues with twelve tales in total, leading to all the people involved in this incident finding themselves in a courtroom, all making different claims over how the hunchback had died. Crime fiction elements are also present near the end of \"The Tale of Attaf\" (see Foreshadowing above).\nHorror fiction.\nHaunting is used as a plot device in gothic fiction and horror fiction, as well as modern paranormal fiction. Legends about haunted houses have long appeared in literature. In particular, the \"Arabian Nights\" tale of \"Ali the Cairene and the Haunted House in Baghdad\" revolves around a house haunted by jinn. The \"Nights\" is almost certainly the earliest surviving literature that mentions ghouls, and many of the stories in that collection involve or reference ghouls. A prime example is the story \"The History of Gherib and His Brother Agib\" (from \"Nights\" vol. 6), in which Gherib, an outcast prince, fights off a family of ravenous Ghouls and then enslaves them and converts them to Islam.\nHorror fiction elements are also found in \"The City of Brass\" tale, which revolves around a ghost town.\nThe horrific nature of Scheherazade's situation is magnified in Stephen King's \"Misery\", in which the protagonist is forced to write a novel to keep his captor from torturing and killing him. The influence of the \"Nights\" on modern horror fiction is certainly discernible in the work of H. P. Lovecraft. As a child, he was fascinated by the adventures recounted in the book, and he attributes some of his creations to his love of the \"1001 Nights\".\nFantasy and science fiction.\nSeveral stories within the \"One Thousand and One Nights\" feature early science fiction elements. One example is \"The Adventures of Bulukiya\", in which the protagonist Bulukiya's quest for the herb of immortality leads him to explore the seas, journey to Paradise and to Hell, and travel across the cosmos to different worlds much larger than his own world, anticipating elements of galactic science fiction; along the way, he encounters societies of jinn, mermaids, talking serpents, talking trees, and other forms of life. In \"Abu al-Husn and His Slave-Girl Tawaddud\", the heroine Tawaddud gives an impromptu lecture on the mansions of the Moon, and the benevolent and sinister aspects of the planets.\nIn another \"1001 Nights\" tale, \"Abdullah the Fisherman and Abdullah the Merman\", the protagonist Abdullah the Fisherman gains the ability to breathe underwater and discovers an underwater society that is portrayed as an inverted reflection of society on land, in that the underwater society follows a form of primitive communism where concepts like money and clothing do not exist. Other \"Arabian Nights\" tales also depict Amazon societies dominated by women, lost ancient technologies, advanced ancient civilizations that went astray, and catastrophes which overwhelmed them.\n\"The City of Brass\" features a group of travellers on an archaeological expedition across the Sahara to find an ancient lost city and attempt to recover a brass vessel that Solomon once used to trap a jinni, and, along the way, encounter a mummified queen, petrified inhabitants, lifelike humanoid robots and automata, marionettes dancing without strings, and a brass horseman robot who directs the party towards the ancient city, which has now become a ghost town. The \"Third Qalandar's Tale\" also features a robot in the form of an uncanny boatman.\nPoetry.\nThere is an abundance of Arabic poetry in \"One Thousand and One Nights\". It is often deployed by stories' narrators to provide detailed descriptions, usually of the beauty of characters. Characters also occasionally quote or speak in verse in certain settings. The uses include but are not limited to:\nIn a typical example, expressing feelings of happiness to oneself from Night 203, Prince Qamar Al-Zaman, standing outside the castle, wants to inform Queen Bodour of his arrival. He wraps his ring in a paper and hands it to the servant who delivers it to the Queen. When she opens it and sees the ring, joy conquers her, and out of happiness she chants this poem:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse transliteration-translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn world culture.\nThe influence of the versions of \"The Nights\" on world literature is immense. Writers as diverse as Henry Fielding to Naguib Mahfouz have alluded to the collection by name in their own works. Other writers who have been influenced by the \"Nights\" include John Barth, Jorge Luis Borges, A. S. Byatt, Italo Calvino, Angela Carter, Constantine P. Cavafy, Wilkie Collins, Arthur Conan Doyle, Alexandre Dumas, Gustave Flaubert, Elizabeth Gaskell, Arthur de Gobineau, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Victor Hugo, H. P. Lovecraft, G\u00e9rard de Nerval, Charles Nodier, Orhan Pamuk, Georges Perec, Marcel Proust, Alexander Pushkin, Salman Rushdie, Marcel Schwob, Walter Scott, Stendhal, William Makepeace Thackeray, Leo Tolstoy, H. G. Wells, and W. B. Yeats.\nVarious characters from this epic have themselves become cultural icons in Western culture, such as Aladdin, Sinbad and Ali Baba. Part of its popularity may have sprung from improved standards of historical and geographical knowledge. The marvelous beings and events typical of fairy tales seem less incredible if they are set further \"long ago\" or farther \"far away\"; this process culminates in the fantasy world having little connection, if any, to actual times and places. Several elements from Arabian mythology are now common in modern fantasy, such as genies, bahamuts, magic carpets, magic lamps, etc. When L. Frank Baum proposed writing a modern fairy tale that banished stereotypical elements, he included the genie as well as the dwarf and the fairy as stereotypes to go.\nIn 1982, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) began naming features on Saturn's moon Enceladus after characters and places in Burton's translation because \"its surface is so strange and mysterious that it was given the \"Arabian Nights\" as a name bank, linking fantasy landscape with a literary fantasy.\"\nIn Arab culture.\nThere is little evidence that the \"Nights\" was particularly treasured in the Arab world. It is rarely mentioned in lists of popular literature and few pre-18th-century manuscripts of the collection exist. Fiction had a low cultural status among Medieval Arabs compared with poetry, and the tales were dismissed as \"khurafa\" (improbable fantasies fit only for entertaining women and children). According to Robert Irwin, \"Even today, with the exception of certain writers and academics, the \"Nights\" is regarded with disdain in the Arabic world. Its stories are regularly denounced as vulgar, improbable, childish and, above all, badly written\".\nNevertheless, the \"Nights\" have proved an inspiration to some modern Egyptian writers, such as Tawfiq al-Hakim (author of the Symbolist play \"Shahrazad\", 1934), Taha Hussein (\"Scheherazade's Dreams\", 1943) and Naguib Mahfouz (\"Arabian Nights and Days\", 1979). Idries Shah finds the Abjad numerical equivalent of the Arabic title, \"alf layla wa layla\", in the Arabic phrase \"\u02beumm al-qi\u1e63\u1e63a\", meaning 'mother of stories'. He goes on to state that many of the stories \"are encoded Sufi teaching stories, descriptions of psychological processes, or enciphered lore of one kind or another\".\nOn a more popular level, film and TV adaptations based on stories like Sinbad and Aladdin enjoyed long lasting popularity in Arabic speaking countries.\nEarly European literature.\nAlthough the first known translation into a European language appeared in 1704, it is possible that the \"Nights\" began exerting its influence on Western culture much earlier. Christian writers in Medieval Spain translated many works from Arabic, mainly philosophy and mathematics, but also Arab fiction, as is evidenced by Juan Manuel's story collection \"El Conde Lucanor\" and Ram\u00f3n Llull's \"The Book of Beasts\".\nKnowledge of the work, direct or indirect, apparently spread beyond Spain. Themes and motifs with parallels in the \"Nights\" are found in Chaucer's \"The Canterbury Tales\" (in \"The Squire's Tale\" the hero travels on a flying brass horse) and Boccaccio's \"Decameron\". Echoes in Giovanni Sercambi's \"Novelle\" and Ariosto's \"Orlando Furioso\" suggest that the story of Shahriyar and Shahzaman was also known. Evidence also appears to show that the stories had spread to the Balkans and a translation of the \"Nights\" into Romanian existed by the 17th century, itself based on a Greek version of the collection.\nWestern literature (18th century onwards).\nGalland translations (1700s).\nThe modern fame of the \"Nights\" derives from the first known European translation by Antoine Galland, which appeared in 1704. According to Robert Irwin, Galland \"played so large a part in discovering the tales, in popularizing them in Europe and in shaping what would come to be regarded as the canonical collection that, at some risk of hyperbole and paradox, he has been called the real author of the \"Nights\"\".\nThe immediate success of Galland's version with the French public may have been because it coincided with the vogue for \"contes de f\u00e9es\" ('fairy stories'). This fashion began with the publication of Madame d'Aulnoy's \"Histoire d'Hypolite\" in 1690. D'Aulnoy's book has a remarkably similar structure to the \"Nights\", with the tales told by a female narrator. The success of the \"Nights\" spread across Europe and by the end of the century there were translations of Galland into English, German, Italian, Dutch, Danish, Russian, Flemish and Yiddish.\nGalland's version provoked a spate of pseudo-Oriental imitations. At the same time, some French writers began to parody the style and concoct far-fetched stories in superficially Oriental settings. These tongue-in-cheek pastiches include Anthony Hamilton's \"Les quatre Facardins\" (1730), Cr\u00e9billon's \"\" (1742) and Diderot's \"Les bijoux indiscrets\" (1748). They often contained veiled allusions to contemporary French society. The most famous example is Voltaire's \"Zadig\" (1748), an attack on religious bigotry set against a vague pre-Islamic Middle Eastern background. The English versions of the \"Oriental Tale\" generally contained a heavy moralising element, with the notable exception of William Beckford's fantasy \"Vathek\" (1786), which had a decisive influence on the development of the Gothic novel. The Polish nobleman Jan Potocki's novel \"Saragossa Manuscript\" (begun 1797) owes a deep debt to the \"Nights\" with its Oriental flavour and labyrinthine series of embedded tales.\nThe work was included on a price-list of books on theology, history, and cartography, which was sent by the Scottish bookseller Andrew Millar (then an apprentice) to a Presbyterian minister. This is illustrative of the title's widespread popularity and availability in the 1720s.\n19th century\u201320th century.\nThe \"Nights\" continued to be a favourite book of many British authors of the Romantic and Victorian eras. According to A. S. Byatt, \"In British Romantic poetry the Arabian Nights stood for the wonderful against the mundane, the imaginative against the prosaically and reductively rational.\" In their autobiographical writings, both Coleridge and de Quincey refer to nightmares the book had caused them when young. Wordsworth and Tennyson also wrote about their childhood reading of the tales in their poetry. Charles Dickens was another enthusiast and the atmosphere of the \"Nights\" pervades the opening of his last novel \"The Mystery of Edwin Drood\" (1870).\nSeveral writers have attempted to add a thousand and second tale, including Th\u00e9ophile Gautier (\"La mille deuxi\u00e8me nuit\", 1842) and Joseph Roth (\"Die Geschichte von der 1002 Nacht\", 1939). Edgar Allan Poe wrote \"The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Scheherazade\" (1845), a short story depicting the eighth and final voyage of Sinbad the Sailor, along with the various mysteries Sinbad and his crew encounter; the anomalies are then described as footnotes to the story. While the king is uncertain\u2014except in the case of the elephants carrying the world on the back of the turtle\u2014that these mysteries are real, they are actual modern events that occurred in various places during, or before, Poe's lifetime. The story ends with the king in such disgust at the tale Scheherazade has just woven, that he has her executed the very next day.\nAnother important literary figure, the Irish poet W. B. Yeats was also fascinated by the Arabian Nights, when he wrote in his prose book, \"A Vision\" an autobiographical poem, titled The Gift of Harun Al-Rashid, in relation to his joint experiments with his wife Georgie Hyde-Lees, with automatic writing, a technique used by many occultists in order to discern messages from the subconscious mind or from other spiritual beings, when the hand moves a pencil or a pen, writing only on a simple sheet of paper and when the person's eyes are shut. Also, the gifted and talented wife, is playing in Yeats's poem as \"a gift\" herself, given only allegedly by the caliph to the Christian and Byzantine philosopher Qusta Ibn Luqa, who acts in the poem as a personification of W. B. Yeats. In July 1934 he was asked by Louis Lambert, while in a tour in the United States, which six books satisfied him most. The list that he gave placed the Arabian Nights, secondary only to William Shakespeare's works.\nModern authors influenced by the \"Nights\" include James Joyce, Marcel Proust, Jorge Luis Borges, John Barth and Ted Chiang.\nFilm, radio and television.\nStories from the \"One Thousand and One Nights\" have been popular subjects for films, beginning with Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s' \"Le Palais des Mille et une nuits\" (1905).\nThe critic Robert Irwin singles out the two versions of \"The Thief of Baghdad\" (1924 version directed by Raoul Walsh; 1940 version produced by Alexander Korda) and Pier Paolo Pasolini's \"Il fiore delle Mille e una notte\" (1974) as ranking \"high among the masterpieces of world cinema.\" Michael James Lundell calls \"Il fiore\" \"the most faithful adaptation, in its emphasis on sexuality, of \"The 1001 Nights\" in its oldest form\".\n\"Alif Laila\" (transl.\u2009One Thousand Nights; 1933) was a Hindi-language fantasy film based on \"One Thousand and One Nights\" from the early era of Indian cinema, directed by Balwant Bhatt and Shanti Dave. K. Amarnath made, \"Alif Laila\" (1953), another Indian fantasy film in Hindi based on the folktale of Aladdin. Niren Lahiri's \"Arabian Nights\", an adventure-fantasy film adaptation of the stories, released in 1946. A number of Indian films based on the \"Nights\" and \"The Thief of Baghdad\" were produced over the years, including \"Baghdad Ka Chor\" (1946), \"Baghdad Thirudan\" (1960), and \"Baghdad Gaja Donga\" (1968). A television series, \"Thief of Baghdad\", was also made in India which aired on Zee TV between 2000 and 2001.\nUPA, an American animation studio, produced an animated feature version of \"1001 Arabian Nights\" (1959), featuring the cartoon character Mr. Magoo.\nThe 1949 animated film \"The Singing Princess\", another movie produced in Italy, is inspired by The Arabian Nights. The animated feature film, \"One Thousand and One Arabian Nights\" (1969), produced in Japan and directed by Osamu Tezuka and Eichii Yamamoto, featured psychedelic imagery and sounds, and erotic material intended for adults.\n\"Alif Laila\" (\"The Arabian Nights\"), a 1993\u20131997 Indian TV series based on the stories from \"One Thousand and One Nights\" produced by Sagar Entertainment Ltd, aired on DD National starts with Scheherazade telling her stories to Shahry\u0101r, and contains both the well-known and the lesser-known stories from \"One Thousand and One Nights\". Another Indian television series, \"Alif Laila\", based on various stories from the collection aired on Dangal TV in 2020.\n\"Alf Leila Wa Leila\", Egyptian television adaptations of the stories was broadcast between the 1980s and early 1990s, with each series featuring a cast of big name Egyptian performers such as Hussein Fahmy, Raghda, Laila Elwi, Yousuf Shaaban, Nelly, Sherihan and Yehia El-Fakharany. Each series premiered on every yearly month of Ramadan between the 1980s and 1990s.\nOne of the best known Arabian Nights-based films is the 1992 Walt Disney animated movie \"Aladdin\", which is loosely based on the story of the same name.\n\"Arabian Nights\" (2000), a two-part television mini-series adopted for BBC and ABC studios, starring Mili Avital, Dougray Scott, and John Leguizamo, and directed by Steve Barron, is based on the translation by Sir Richard Francis Burton.\nShabnam Rezaei and Aly Jetha created, and the Vancouver-based Big Bad Boo Studios produced \"1001 Nights\" (2011), an animated television series for children, which launched on Teletoon and airs in 80 countries around the world, including Discovery Kids Asia.\n\"Arabian Nights\" (2015, in Portuguese: \"As Mil e uma Noites\"), a three-part film directed by Miguel Gomes, is based on \"One Thousand and One Nights\".\n\"Alf Leila Wa Leila\", a popular Egyptian radio adaptation was broadcast on Egyptian radio stations for 26 years. Directed by famed radio director Mohamed Mahmoud Shabaan also known by his nickname \"Baba Sharoon\", the series featured a cast of respected Egyptian actors, among them Zouzou Nabil as Scheherazade and Abdelrahim El Zarakany as Shahryar.\n\"Aladdin\" (2019) is a musical fantasy film directed by Guy Ritchie from a screenplay he co-wrote with John August. Co-produced by Walt Disney Pictures and Rideback, it is a live-action remake of Disney's 1992 animated feature film of the same title.\n\"Aladdin 3477: The Jinn of Wisdom\" (2025) is the first in a trilogy of live-action sci-fi films written and directed by \"Star Wars\" artist Matt Busch. The films take place 1,500 years in the future, yet stay closer to the original Arabian Nights tale than the Disney versions, including taking place in Asia.\nMusic.\nThe \"Nights\" has inspired many pieces of music, including:\nClassical\nPop, rock, and metal\nMusical theatre\nGames.\nPopular modern games with an \"Arabian Nights\" theme include the \"Prince of Persia\" series, \",\" \"Sonic and the Secret Rings\", \"Disney's Aladdin\", \"Bookworm Adventures\", and the pinball table \"Tales of the Arabian Nights.\" Additionally, the popular card game ' released an expansion set titled '.\nThe Demoman in \"Team Fortress 2\" has a set titled One Thousand and One Demoknights, including three weapons and one cosmetic item.\n\"Sultan\u2019s Game\", developed by Double Cross and released for Steam on March 30, 2025, is \u201ca card-based simulation and narrative game, inspired by \"The One Thousand and One Nights\",\u201d in which players are commanded by the Sultan \u201cto play a cruel game. Each week you draw a card, and have to complete its challenge within seven days. Forced to make dreadful choices to beat the Sultan\u2019s Game and save your own life, you will have to find a way to survive not just the Game, but its consequences too.\u201d In addition to the challenges imposed by the Sultan, the game includes a variety of narrative events that explore themes such as survival, betrayal, ambition, lust, and poetic justice.Just over three months after its release, the game surpassed one\u202fmillion copies sold.\nIllustrators.\nMany artists have illustrated the \"Arabian nights\", including: Pierre-Cl\u00e9ment Marillier for \"Le Cabinet des F\u00e9es\" (1785\u20131789), Gustave Dor\u00e9, L\u00e9on Carr\u00e9 (Granville, 1878 \u2013 Alger, 1942), Roger Blachon, Fran\u00e7oise Boudignon, Andr\u00e9 Dahan, Amato Soro, Albert Robida, Alcide Th\u00e9ophile Robaudi and Marcelino Truong; Vittorio Zecchin (Murano, 1878 \u2013 Murano, 1947) and Emanuele Luzzati; The German Morgan; Mohammed Racim (Algiers, 1896 \u2013 Algiers 1975), Sani ol-Molk (1849\u20131856), Anton Pieck and Emre Orhun, Virginia Frances Sterrett (1928).\nFamous illustrators for British editions include: Arthur Boyd Houghton, John Tenniel, John Everett Millais and George John Pinwell for Dalziel's Illustrated Arabian Nights Entertainments, published in 1865; Walter Crane for Aladdin's Picture Book (1876); Frank Brangwyn for the 1896 edition of Lane's translation; Albert Letchford for the 1897 edition of Burton's translation; Edmund Dulac for Stories from the Arabian Nights (1907), Princess Badoura (1913) and Sindbad the Sailor &amp; Other Tales from the Arabian Nights (1914).

Organized traffic generally has well-established priorities, lanes, right-of-way, and traffic control at intersections. (International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea govern the oceans and influence some laws for navigating domestic waters.)\nTraffic is formally organized in many jurisdictions, with marked lanes, junctions, intersections, interchanges, traffic signals, cones, or signs. Traffic is often classified by type: heavy motor vehicle (e.g., car, truck), other vehicle (e.g., moped, bicycle), and pedestrian. Different classes may share speed limits and easement, or may be segregated. Some jurisdictions may have very detailed and complex rules of the road while others rely more on drivers' common sense and willingness to cooperate.\nOrganization typically produces a better combination of travel safety and efficiency. Events which disrupt the flow and may cause traffic to degenerate into a disorganized mess include road construction, collisions, and debris in the roadway. On particularly busy freeways, a minor disruption may persist in a phenomenon known as traffic waves. A complete breakdown of organization may result in traffic congestion and gridlock. Simulations of organized traffic frequently involve queuing theory, stochastic processes and equations of mathematical physics applied to traffic flow.\nEtymology and types.\nThe word \"traffic\" originally meant \"trade\" (as it still does) and comes from the Old Italian verb \"trafficare\" and noun \"traffico,\" as well as the Middle French \"trafique\". The origin of the Italian words is unclear. Suggestions include Catalan \"trafegar\" \"decant\", an assumed Vulgar Latin verb \"transfricare\" 'rub across', an assumed Vulgar Latin combination of \"trans-\" and \"facere\" 'make or do', Arabic \"tafriq\" 'distribution', and Arabic \"taraffaqa\", which can mean 'seek profit'. Broadly, the term covers many kinds of traffic including network traffic, air traffic, marine traffic and rail traffic, but it is often used narrowly to mean only road traffic.\nRules of the road.\nRules of the road and driving etiquette are the general practices and procedures that road users are required to follow. These rules usually apply to all road users, though they are of special importance to motorists and cyclists. These rules govern interactions between vehicles and pedestrians. The basic traffic rules are defined by an international treaty under the authority of the United Nations, the 1968 \"Vienna Convention on Road Traffic\". Not all countries are signatory to the convention and, even among signatories, local variations in practice may be found. There are also unwritten local rules of the road, which are generally understood by local drivers.\nAs a general rule, drivers are expected to avoid a collision with another vehicle and pedestrians, regardless of whether or not the applicable rules of the road allow them to be where they happen to be.\nIn addition to the rules applicable by default, traffic signs and traffic lights must be obeyed, and instructions may be given by a police officer, either routinely (on a busy crossing instead of traffic lights) or as road traffic control around a construction zone, accident, or other road disruption.\nDirectionality.\nTraffic heading in inverse ways ought to be isolated so as to not hinder each other's way. The most essential guideline is whether to utilize the left or right half of the street.\nTraffic regulations.\nIn many countries, the rules of the road are codified, setting out the legal requirements and punishments for breaking them.\nIn the United Kingdom, the rules are set out in the Highway Code, which includes not only obligations but also advice on how to drive sensibly and safely.\nIn the United States, traffic laws are regulated by the states and municipalities through their respective traffic codes. Most of these are based at least in part on the Uniform Vehicle Code, but there are variations from state to state. In states such as Florida, traffic law and criminal law are separate; therefore, unless someone flees the scene of an accident or commits vehicular homicide or manslaughter, they are only guilty of a minor traffic offense. However, states such as South Carolina have completely criminalised their traffic law, so, for example, one is guilty of a misdemeanor simply for travelling 5 miles over the speed limit.\nTrail ethics (right of way).\nTrail ethics are a set of informal rules for right of way for users of trails, including hikers, mountaineers, equestrians, cyclists, and mountain bikers.\nOrganised traffic.\nPassage priority (right of way).\nVehicles often come into conflict with other vehicles and pedestrians because their intended courses of travel intersect, and thus interfere with each other's routes. The general principle that establishes who has the right to go first is called \"right of way\" or \"priority\". It establishes who has the right to use the conflicting part of the road and who has to wait until the other does so.\nSigns, signals, markings and other features are often used to make priority explicit. Some signs, such as the stop sign, are nearly universal. When there are no signs or markings, different rules are observed depending on the location. These default priority rules differ between countries, and may even vary within countries. Trends toward uniformity are exemplified at an international level by the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals, which prescribes standardised traffic control devices (signs, signals, and markings) for establishing the right of way where necessary.\nCrosswalks (or pedestrian crossings) are common in populated areas, and may indicate that pedestrians have priority over vehicular traffic. In most modern cities, the traffic signal is used to establish the right of way on the busy roads. Its primary purpose is to give each road a duration of time in which its traffic may use the intersection in an organised way. The intervals of time assigned for each road may be adjusted to take into account factors such as difference in volume of traffic, the needs of pedestrians, or other traffic signals. Pedestrian crossings may be located near other traffic control devices; if they are not also regulated in some way, vehicles must give priority to them when in use. Traffic on a public road usually has priority over other traffic such as traffic emerging from private access; rail crossings and drawbridges are typical exceptions.\nUncontrolled traffic.\nUncontrolled traffic comes in the absence of lane markings and traffic control signals. On roads without marked lanes, drivers tend to keep to the appropriate side if the road is wide enough. Drivers frequently overtake others. Obstructions are\ncommon.\nIntersections have no signals or signage, and a particular road at a busy intersection may be dominant \u2013 that is, its traffic flows \u2013 until a break in traffic, at which time the dominance shifts to the other road where vehicles are queued. At the intersection of two perpendicular roads, a traffic jam may result if four vehicles face each other side-on.\nTurning.\nDrivers often seek to turn onto another road or onto private property. The vehicle's blinking turn signals (commonly known as \"blinkers\" or \"indicators\") are often used as a way to announce one's intention to turn, thus alerting other drivers. The actual usage of directional signals varies greatly amongst countries, although its purpose is to indicate a driver's intention to depart from the current (and natural) flow of traffic well before the departure is executed (typically 3 seconds as a guideline).\nTurning towards the edge of the road closest to a vehicle usually requires a driver to look out only for pedestrians and bicyclists.\nTurning towards the opposing edge of the road usually requires a vehicle to cross opposing traffic. In this scenario, a driver often must stop and wait for a gap to turn, and if stopped in a through lane, such a stop might cause inconvenience for vehicles following behind that do not wish to turn. This is why dedicated lanes and protected traffic signals for turning are sometimes provided. \nOn busier intersections where a protected lane would be ineffective or cannot be built, turning may be entirely prohibited, and drivers will be required to \"drive around the block\" in order to accomplish the turn. Many cities employ this tactic quite often; in San Francisco, due to its common practice, making three right turns is known colloquially as a \"San Francisco left turn\". Likewise, as many intersections in Taipei City are too busy to allow direct left turns, signs often direct drivers to drive around the block to turn.\nTurning rules are by no means universal. For example, in New Zealand (a drive-on-the-left country) between 1977 and 2012, left turning traffic had to give way to opposing right-turning traffic wishing to take the same road (unless there were multiple lanes, but then one must take care in case a vehicle jumped lanes). New Zealand abolished this particular rule on 25 March 2012, except at roundabouts or when denoted by a Give Way or Stop sign. Although the rule caused initial driver confusion, and many intersections required or still require modification, the change is predicted to eventually prevent one death and 13 serious injuries annually.\nOn roads with multiple lanes, turning traffic is generally expected to move to the lane closest to the direction they wish to turn. For example, traffic intending to turn right will usually move to the rightmost lane before the intersection. Likewise, left-turning traffic will move to the leftmost lane. Exceptions to this rule may exist where for example the traffic authority decides that the two rightmost lanes will be for turning right, in which case drivers may take whichever of them to turn. Traffic may adapt to informal patterns that rise naturally rather than by force of authority. For example, it is common for drivers to observe (and trust) the turn signals used by other drivers in order to make turns from other lanes. If several vehicles on the right lane are all turning right, a vehicle may come from the next-to-right lane and turn right as well, in parallel with the other right-turning vehicles.\nIntersections.\nIn most of Continental Europe, the default rule is to give priority to the right, but this may be overridden by signs or road markings. There, priority was initially given according to the social rank of each traveler, but early in the life of the automobile this rule was deemed impractical and replaced with the \"priorit\u00e9 \u00e0 droite\" (priority to the right) rule, which still applies. At a traffic circle where \"priorit\u00e9 \u00e0 droite\" is not overridden, traffic on what would otherwise be a roundabout gives way to traffic entering the circle. Most French roundabouts now have give-way signs for traffic entering the circle, but there remain some notable exceptions that operate on the old rule, such as the Place de l'\u00c9toile around the Arc de Triomphe. Priority to the right where used in continental Europe may be overridden by an ascending hierarchy of markings, signs, signals, and authorized persons.\nIn the United Kingdom, priority is generally indicated by signs or markings, so that almost all junctions between public roads (except those governed by traffic signals) have a concept of a major road and minor road. The default give-way-to-the-right rule used in Continental Europe causes problems for many British and Irish drivers who are accustomed to having right of way by default unless otherwise indicated. A very small proportion of low-traffic junctions are unmarked \u2013 typically on housing estates or in rural areas. Here the rule is to \"proceed with great care\" i.e. slow the vehicle and check for traffic on the intersecting road.\nOther countries use various methods similar to the above examples to establish the right of way at intersections. For example, in most of the United States, the default priority is to yield to traffic from the right, but this is usually overridden by traffic control devices or other rules, like the boulevard rule. This rule holds that traffic entering a major road from a smaller road or alley must yield to the traffic of the busier road, but signs are often still posted. The boulevard rule can be compared with the above concept of a major and minor road, or the priority roads that may be found in countries that are parties to the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals.\nAlso known as a \"four-way\" intersection, this intersection is the most common configuration for roads that cross each other, and the most basic type.\nIf traffic signals do not control a four-way intersection, signs or other features are typically used to control movements and make clear priorities. The most common arrangement is to indicate that one road has priority over the other, but there are complex cases where all traffic approaching an intersection must yield and may be required to stop.\nIn the United States, South Africa, and Canada, there are four-way intersections with a stop sign at every entrance, called four-way stops. A failed signal or a flashing red light is equivalent to a four-way stop, or an all-way stop. Special rules for four-way stops may include:\nIn Europe and other places, there are similar intersections. These may be marked by special signs (according to the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals), a danger sign with a black X representing a crossroads. This sign informs drivers that the intersection is uncontrolled and that default rules apply. In Europe and in many areas of North America the default rules that apply at uncontrolled four-way intersections are almost identical:\nProtected intersection for bicycles.\nA number of features make this protected intersection. A corner refuge island, a setback crossing of the pedestrians and cyclists, generally between 1.5\u20137 metres of setback, a forward stop bar, which allows cyclists to stop for a traffic light well ahead of motor traffic who must stop behind the crosswalk. Separate signal staging or at least an advance green for cyclists and pedestrians is used to give cyclists and pedestrians no conflicts or a head start over traffic. The design makes a right turn on red, and sometimes left on red depending on the geometry of the intersection in question, possible in many cases, often without stopping.\nThis type of intersection is common in the bicycle-friendly Netherlands.\nPedestrian crossings.\nPedestrians must often cross from one side of a road to the other, and in doing so may come into the way of vehicles traveling on the road. In many places pedestrians are entirely left to look after themselves, that is, they must observe the road and cross when they can see that no traffic will threaten them. Busier cities usually provide pedestrian crossings, which are strips of the road where pedestrians are expected to cross.\nThe actual appearance of pedestrian crossings varies greatly, but the two most common appearances are: (1) a series of lateral white stripes or (2) two longitudinal white lines. The former is usually preferred, as it stands out more conspicuously against the dark pavement.\nSome pedestrian crossings accompany a traffic signal to make vehicles stop at regular intervals so pedestrians can cross. Some countries have \"intelligent\" pedestrian signals, where the pedestrian must push a button in order to assert their intention to cross. In some countries, approaching traffic is monitored by radar or by electromagnetic sensors buried in the road surface, and the pedestrian crossing lights are set to red if a speed infringement is detected. This has the effect of enforcing the local speed limit. See Speed Limits below.\nPedestrian crossings without traffic signals are also common. In this case, the traffic laws usually states that the pedestrian has the right of way when crossing, and that vehicles must stop when a pedestrian uses the crossing. Countries and driving cultures vary greatly as to the extent to which this is respected. In the state of Nevada the car has the right of way when the crosswalk signal specifically forbids pedestrian crossing. Traffic culture is a determinant factor for the behaviors of all road users\u2019 traffic. Specifically, it has a main role in crashes.\nSome jurisdictions forbid crossing or using the road anywhere other than at crossings, termed \"jaywalking\". In other areas, pedestrians may have the right to cross where they choose, and have right of way over vehicular traffic while crossing.\nIn most areas, an intersection is considered to have a crosswalk, even if not painted, as long as the roads meet at approximate right angles. The United Kingdom and Croatia are among the exceptions.\nPedestrian crossings may also be located away from intersections.\nLevel crossings.\nA level crossing is an at-grade intersection of a railway by a road. Because of safety issues, they are often equipped with closable gates, crossing bells and warning signs.\nSpeed limits.\nThe higher the speed of a vehicle, the more difficult collision avoidance becomes and the greater the damage if a collision does occur. Therefore, many countries of the world limit the maximum speed allowed on their roads. Vehicles are not supposed to be driven at speeds which are higher than the posted maximum.\nTo enforce speed limits, two approaches are generally employed. In the United States, it is common for the police to patrol the streets and use special equipment (typically a radar unit) to measure the speed of vehicles, and pull over any vehicle found to be in violation of the speed limit. In Brazil, Colombia and some European countries, there are computerized speed-measuring devices spread throughout the city, which will automatically detect speeding drivers and take a photograph of the license plate (or number plate), which is later used for applying and mailing the ticket. Many jurisdictions in the U.S. use this technology as well.\nA mechanism that was developed in Germany is the , or \"green wave\", which is an indicator that shows the optimal speed to travel for the synchronized green lights along that corridor. Driving faster or slower than the speed set by the behavior of the lights causes the driver to encounter many red lights. This discourages drivers from speeding or impeding the flow of traffic. See related traffic wave and Pedestrian Crossings, above.\nOvertaking.\n\"Overtaking\" (or \"passing\") refers to a maneuver by which one or more vehicles traveling in the same direction are passed by another vehicle. On two-lane roads, when there is a split line or a dashed line on the side of the overtaker, drivers may overtake when it is safe. On multi-lane roads in most jurisdictions, overtaking is permitted in the \"slower\" lanes, though many require a special circumstance. See \"Lanes\" below.\nIn the United Kingdom and Canada, notably on extra-urban roads, a solid white or yellow line closer to the driver is used to indicate that no overtaking is allowed in that lane. A double white or yellow line means that neither side may overtake.\nIn the United States, a solid white line means that lane changes are discouraged and a double white line means that the lane change is prohibited.\nLanes.\nWhen a street is wide enough to accommodate several vehicles traveling side-by-side, it is usual for traffic to organize itself into \"lanes\", that is, parallel corridors of traffic. Some roads have one lane for each direction of travel and others have multiple lanes for each direction. Most countries apply pavement markings to clearly indicate the limits of each lane and the direction of travel that it must be used for. In other countries lanes have no markings at all and drivers follow them mostly by intuition rather than visual stimulus.\nOn roads that have multiple lanes going in the same direction, drivers may usually shift amongst lanes as they please, but they must do so in a way that does not cause inconvenience to other drivers. Driving cultures vary greatly on the issue of \"lane ownership\": in some countries, drivers traveling in a lane will be very protective of their right to travel in it while in others drivers will routinely expect other drivers to shift back and forth.\nDesignation and overtaking\nThe usual designation for lanes on divided highways is the fastest lane is the one closest to the center of the road, and the slowest to the edge of the road. Drivers are usually expected to keep in the slowest lane unless overtaking, though with more traffic congestion all lanes are often used.\nWhen driving on the left:\nWhen driving on the right:\nCountries party to the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic have uniform rules about overtaking and lane designation. The convention details (amongst other things) that \"Every driver shall keep to the edge of the carriageway appropriate to the direction of traffic\", and the \"Drivers overtaking shall do so on the side opposite to that appropriate to the direction of traffic\", notwithstanding the presence or absence of oncoming traffic. Allowed exceptions to these rules include turning or heavy traffic, traffic in lines, or situation in which signs or markings must dictate otherwise. These rules must be more strictly adhered to on roads with oncoming traffic, but still apply on multi-lane and divided highways. Many countries in Europe are party to the Vienna Conventions on traffic and roads. In Australia (which is not a contracting party), traveling in any lane other than the \"slow\" lane on a road with a speed limit at or above is an offence, unless signage is posted to the contrary or the driver is overtaking.\nMany areas in North America do not have any laws about staying to the slowest lanes unless overtaking. In those areas, unlike many parts of Europe, traffic is allowed to overtake on any side, even in a slower lane. This practice is known as \"passing on the right\" in the United States and \"overtaking on the inside\" and \"undertaking\" in the United Kingdom.\nWhen referring to individual lanes on dual carriageways, one does not consider traffic travelling the opposite direction. The inside lane (in the British English sense, i.e. the lane beside the hard shoulder) refers to the lane used for normal travel, while the middle lane is used for overtaking cars on the inside lane. The outside lane (i.e. closest to oncoming traffic) is used for overtaking vehicles in the middle lane. The same principle lies with dual carriageways with more than three lanes.\nU.S.-state-specific practices\nIn some US states (such as Louisiana, Massachusetts and New York), although there are laws requiring all traffic on a public way to use the right-most lane unless overtaking, this rule is often ignored and seldom enforced on multi-lane roadways. Some states, such as Colorado, use a combination of laws and signs restricting speeds or vehicles on certain lanes to emphasize overtaking only on the left lane, and to avoid a psychological condition commonly called road rage.\nIn California, cars may use any lane on multi-lane roadways. Drivers moving slower than the general flow of traffic are required to stay in the right-most lanes (by California Vehicle Code (CVC) 21654) to keep the way clear for faster vehicles and thus speed up traffic. However, faster drivers may legally pass in the slower lanes if conditions allow (by CVC 21754). But the CVC also requires trucks to stay in the right lane, or in the right two lanes if the roadway has four or more lanes going in their direction. The oldest freeways in California, and some freeway interchanges, often have ramps on the left, making signs like \"TRUCKS OK ON LEFT LANE\" or \"TRUCKS MAY USE ALL LANES\" necessary to override the default rule. Lane splitting, or riding motorcycles in the space between cars in traffic, is permitted as long as it is done in a safe and prudent manner.\nOne-way roadways.\nIn order to increase traffic capacity and safety, a route may have two or more separate roads for each direction of traffic. Alternatively, a given road might be declared \"one-way\".\nHigh-speed roads.\nIn large cities, moving from one part of the city to another by means of ordinary streets and avenues can be time-consuming since traffic is often slowed by at-grade junctions, tight turns, narrow marked lanes and lack of a minimum speed limit. Therefore, it has become common practice for larger cities to build roads for faster through traffic. There are two different types of roads used to provide high-speed access across urban areas:\nMotor vehicle drivers wishing to travel over great distances within the city will usually take the freeways or expressways in order to minimize travel time. When a crossing road is at the same grade as the freeway, a bridge (or, less often, an underpass) will be built for the crossing road. If the freeway is elevated, the crossing road will pass underneath it.\nMinimum speed signs are sometimes posted (although increasingly rare) and usually indicate that any vehicle traveling slower than should indicate a slower speed of travel to other motor vehicles by engaging the vehicle's four-way flashing lights. Alternative slower-than-posted speeds may be in effect, based on the posted speed limit of the highway/freeway.\nSystems of freeways and expressways are also built to connect distant and regional cities, notable systems include the Interstate highways, the Autobahnen and the Expressway Network of the People's Republic of China.\nOne-way streets.\nIn more sophisticated systems such as large cities, this concept is further extended: some streets are marked as being \"one-way\", and on those streets all traffic must flow in only one direction. Pedestrians on the sidewalks are generally not limited to one-way movement. Drivers wishing to reach a destination they have already passed must return via other streets. One-way streets, despite the inconveniences to some individual drivers, can greatly improve traffic flow since they usually allow traffic to move faster and tend to simplify intersections.\nCongested traffic.\nIn some places traffic volume is consistently, extremely large, either during periods of time referred to as \"rush hour\" or perpetually. Exceptionally, traffic upstream of a vehicular collision or an obstruction, such as construction, may also be constrained, resulting in a traffic jam. Such dynamics in relation to traffic congestion is known as traffic flow. Traffic engineers sometimes gauge the quality of traffic flow in terms of level of service.\nIn measured traffic data, have been found that are qualitatively the same for different highways in different countries. Some of these common features distinguish the wide moving jam and synchronized flow phases of congested traffic in Kerner's three-phase traffic theory.\nRush hour.\nDuring business days in most major cities, traffic congestion reaches great intensity at predictable times of the day due to the large number of vehicles using the road at the same time. This phenomenon is called \"rush hour\" or \"peak hour\", although the period of high traffic intensity often exceeds one hour. Since the advent of car radios, radio programming during rush hour is likely to be called drive time.\nCongestion mitigation.\nRush hour policies.\nSome cities adopt policies to reduce rush-hour traffic and pollution and encourage the use of public transportation. For example, in S\u00e3o Paulo, Manila and in Mexico City, each vehicle has a specific day of the week in which it is forbidden from traveling the roads during rush hour. The day for each vehicle is taken from the license plate number, and this rule is enforced by traffic police and also by hundreds of strategically positioned traffic cameras backed by computerized image-recognition systems that issue tickets to offending drivers.\nIn the United States and Canada, several expressways have a special lane (called an \"HOV Lane\" \u2013 High Occupancy Vehicle Lane) that can only be used by cars carrying two (some locations-three) or more people. Also, many major cities have instituted strict parking prohibitions during rush hour on major arterial streets leading to and from the central business district. During designated weekday hours, vehicles parked on these primary routes are subject to prompt ticketing and towing at owner expense. The purpose of these restrictions is to make available an additional traffic lane in order to maximize available traffic capacity. Additionally, several cities offer a public telephone service where citizens can arrange rides with others depending on where they live and work. The purpose of these policies is to reduce the number of vehicles on the roads and thus reduce rush-hour traffic intensity.\nMetered freeways are also a solution for controlling rush hour traffic. In Phoenix, Arizona and Seattle, Washington, among other places, metered on-ramps have been implemented. During rush hour, traffic signals are used with green lights to allow one car per blink of the light to proceed on to the freeway.\nRush hour is typically caused by multiple cars all going to once place at the same time. There is no way to fix the issue because the economy has set times for work, school, and running errands all during the same hours. There is no avoiding this problem because it exists in every major metropolitan area in the world.\nPre-emption.\nIn some areas, emergency responders are provided with specialized equipment, such as a Mobile Infrared Transmitter, which allows emergency response vehicles, particularly fire-fighting apparatus, to have high-priority travel by having the lights along their route change to green. The technology behind these methods has evolved, from panels at the fire department (which could trigger and control green lights for certain major corridors) to optical systems (which the individual fire apparatus can be equipped with to communicate directly with receivers on the signal head). In certain jurisdictions, public transport buses and government-operated winter service vehicles are permitted to use this equipment to extend the length of a green light.\nDuring emergencies where evacuation of a heavily populated area is required, local authorities may institute contraflow lane reversal, in which all lanes of a road lead away from a danger zone regardless of their original flow. Aside from emergencies, contraflow may also be used to ease traffic congestion during rush hour or at the end of a sports event (where a large number of cars are leaving the venue at the same time). For example, the six lanes of the Lincoln Tunnel can be changed from three inbound and three outbound to a two/four configuration depending on traffic volume. The Brazilian highways Rodovia dos Imigrantes and Rodovia Anchieta connect S\u00e3o Paulo to the Atlantic coast. Almost all lanes of both highways are usually reversed during weekends to allow for heavy seaside traffic. The reversibility of the highways requires many additional highway ramps and complicated interchanges.\nIntelligent transportation systems.\nAn intelligent transportation system (ITS) is a system of hardware, software, and operators-in-the-loop that allow better monitoring and control of traffic in order to optimize traffic flow. As the number of vehicle lane miles traveled per year continues to increase dramatically, and as the number of vehicle lane miles constructed per year has not been keeping pace, this has led to ever-increasing traffic congestion. As a cost-effective solution toward optimizing traffic, ITS presents a number of technologies to reduce congestion by monitoring traffic flows through the use of sensors and live cameras or analysing cellular phone data travelling in cars (floating car data) and in turn rerouting traffic as needed through the use of variable message boards (VMS), highway advisory radio, on board or off board navigation devices and other systems through integration of traffic data with navigation systems. Additionally, the roadway network has been increasingly fitted with additional communications and control infrastructure to allow traffic operations personnel to monitor weather conditions, for dispatching maintenance crews to perform snow or ice removal, as well as intelligent systems such as automated bridge de-icing systems which help to prevent accidents.\nAviation.\nIn aviation, right-of-way rules are established over the principle that the least maneuverable aircraft takes priority. In the United States, the Code of Federal Regulations ranks air traffic in the following passage order:\nIn addition, head-on approaching aircraft shall alter course to the right. An aircraft being overtaken has the right-of-way. A landing aircraft has the right-of-way over other surface-operating aircraft.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Known for primarily playing femmes fatales and women of mystery on film and television, she became one of the most popular sex symbols of the 1990s. She is the recipient of various accolades, including a Primetime Emmy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a nomination for an Academy Award. She was named Officer of the Order of Arts and Letters in France in 2005 (Commander in 2021).\nAfter modeling in television commercials and print advertisements, Stone made her film debut as an extra in \"Stardust Memories\" (1980) and played her first speaking part in the horror film \"Deadly Blessing\" (1981). In the 1980s, she appeared in such films as \"Irreconcilable Differences\" (1984), \"King Solomon's Mines\" (1985), \"Action Jackson\" (1988), and \"Above the Law\" (1988). She had a breakthrough with her part in Paul Verhoeven's science fiction film \"Total Recall\" (1990), before rising to international recognition when she portrayed Catherine Tramell in Verhoeven's erotic thriller \"Basic Instinct\" (1992), for which she earned her first Golden Globe Award nomination.\nStone's performance as a trophy wife in Martin Scorsese's crime drama \"Casino\" (1995) earned her a Golden Globe Award along with a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress. Her other notable films include \"Sliver\" (1993), \"The Specialist\" (1994), \"The Quick and the Dead\" (1995), \"Catwoman\" (2004), \"Broken Flowers\" (2005), \"Alpha Dog\" (2006), \"Bobby\" (2006), \"Fading Gigolo\" (2013), \"The Disaster Artist\" (2017), \"\" (2019), and \"The Laundromat\" (2019).\nOn television, Stone has featured in the ABC miniseries \"War and Remembrance\" (1987), the HBO television film \"If These Walls Could Talk 2\" (2000), Steven Soderbergh's \"Mosaic\" (2017) and Ryan Murphy's \"Ratched\" (2020). She made guest appearances in \"The Practice\" (2004) and \"\" (2010), winning the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series for the former.\nEarly life.\nSharon Vonne Stone was born on March 10, 1958, in Meadville, Pennsylvania, to Methodist parents Dorothy Marie (n\u00e9e Lawson), an accountant, and Joseph William Stone II, a tool and die manufacturer and former factory worker. She has three siblings. She is mostly of Scots-Irish and English descent. She has some Irish ancestry. In a 2013 interview with Conan O'Brien, she stated that her Irish ancestors arrived in the United States during the Great Famine. She has a reported IQ of 154. Stone was considered academically gifted as a child and entered the second grade when she was five years old. Stone said that she and her sister were both sexually abused as children by their maternal grandfather, in an interview to \"The New York Times\" in March 2021, while promoting her memoir \"The Beauty of Living Twice\". At 14, her neck was badly injured while breaking a horse when the animal bucked as it charged toward a washing line.\nShe graduated from Saegertown High School in Saegertown, Pennsylvania, in 1975. Stone was admitted to Edinboro State College on a creative writing scholarship at age 15, but quit college and moved to New York City to become a fashion model. Inspired by Hillary Clinton, in 2016 Stone went back to Edinboro University of Pennsylvania to complete her degree.\nCareer.\nModeling and early screen appearances (1976\u20131989).\nWhile attending Edinboro State College, Stone won the title of Miss Crawford County, Pennsylvania, and in 1976, was a candidate for Miss Pennsylvania. One of the pageant judges told her to quit college and move to New York City to become a fashion model. Stone left Meadville and moved in with an aunt in New Jersey, and by 1977, she had been signed by Ford Modeling Agency in New York City. She soon moved to Europe, living for a year in Milan and then in Paris. While living there, she decided to quit modeling and pursue acting. \"So I packed my bags, moved back to New York, and stood in line to be an extra in a Woody Allen movie\", she later recalled. At 20, Stone was cast for a brief role in Allen's dramedy \"Stardust Memories\" (1980) and had a speaking part a year later in the horror film \"Deadly Blessing\" (1981).\nFrench director Claude Lelouch cast Stone in the musical epic \"Les Uns et les Autres\" (1982), starring James Caan, but she was on screen for two minutes and did not appear in the credits. She secured guest-spots on the television series \"Silver Spoons\" (1982), \"Bay City Blues\" (1983), \"Remington Steele\" (1983), \"Magnum, P.I.\" (1984), and \"T. J. Hooker\" (1985); played a starlet who breaks up the marriage of a successful director and his screenwriter wife in the drama \"Irreconcilable Differences\" (1984), opposite Ryan O'Neal, Shelley Long and a young Drew Barrymore; and starred as a resourceful woman teaming up with a fortune hunter (played by Richard Chamberlain) in the action-centered \"King Solomon's Mines\" (1985) and \"Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold\" (1986), a light, comedic take on the \"Indiana Jones\" film series, which were poorly received by critics and audiences. In his review for \"King Solomon's Mines\", Walter Goodman of \"The New York Times\" considered that Stone was \"up to date as a spunky, sexy, smart-talking heroine with an effective right hook\" but felt that the story was \"lost in the effects\". For her performance in \"Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold\", she received her first Golden Raspberry Award nomination for Worst Actress.\nStone obtained the role of Janice Henry in the ABC miniseries \"War and Remembrance\" (1987), the sequel to the 1983 miniseries \"The Winds of War\", based on the 1978 novel of the same name written by Herman Wouk. Through the remainder of the 1980s, she appeared as a reporter in the comedy \"\" (1987), an attractive but mysterious woman with a hidden agenda in the thriller \"Cold Steel\" (1987), the wife of an ex-CIA agent in the crime film \"Above the Law\" (1988) and the ill-fated wife of a successful businessman in the action film \"Action Jackson\" (1988).\nBreakthrough and \"Basic Instinct\" (1990\u20131992).\nIn Paul Verhoeven's \"Total Recall\" (1990), a science fiction action film opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger, Stone played the seemingly loving wife of a construction worker. The film received favorable reviews and made $261.2\u00a0million worldwide, giving Stone's career a major boost, leading to her being cast in five feature films released throughout 1991. She played what Roger Ebert described as the \"bad girl\" in the romantic comedy \"He Said, She Said\", a sexually repressed woman in the psychological thriller \"Scissors\", a wealthy blonde in the crime drama \"Diary of a Hitman\", a provocative young photojournalist in the thriller \"Year of the Gun\" and the agent and former lover of a writer in the neo-noir \"Where Sleeping Dogs Lie\".\nIn another Verhoeven film, the erotic thriller \"Basic Instinct\" (1992), she took on the role that made her a star, playing Catherine Tramell, a brilliant bisexual novelist and alleged serial killer. Several actresses at the time turned down the role, mostly because of the nudity required.\nCritical response towards \"Basic Instinct\" was mixed, but Stone received critical acclaim for her \"star-making performance\"; Peter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" remarked that \"Verhoeven's cinematic wet dream delivers the goods, especially when Sharon Stone struts on with enough come-on carnality to singe the screen,\" and observed of the actress' portrayal: \"Stone, a former model, is a knockout; she even got a rise out of Ah-nold in Verhoeven's \"Total Recall\". But being the bright spot in too many dull movies (\"He Said, She Said\"; \"Irreconcilable Differences\") stalled her career. Though \"Basic Instinct\" establishes Stone as a bombshell for the 1990s, it also shows she can nail a laugh or shade an emotion with equal aplomb.\" Australian critic Shannon J. Harvey of \"The Sunday Times\" called the film \"one of the best films of the early 1990s, doing more for female empowerment than any feminist rally. Stone \u2013 in her star-making performance \u2013 is as hot and sexy as she is ice-pick cold.\" For the part, Stone earned a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama, four MTV Movie Awards nominations, and a Golden Raspberry Award nomination for Worst New Star for her \"tribute to Theodore Cleaver\". The film also became one of the most financially successful productions of the 1990s, grossing US$352.9\u00a0million worldwide.\nLeading lady status (1993\u20131999).\nIn 1993, Stone played a femme fatale in the erotic thriller \"Sliver\", based on Ira Levin's eponymous novel about the mysterious occurrences in a privately owned New York City high-rise apartment building. The film was heavily panned by critics and earned Stone a Golden Raspberry Award nomination for Worst Actress but became a commercial success, grossing US$116.3\u00a0million at the international box office. She also made a cameo appearance in the action film \"Last Action Hero\" (1993), reuniting with Arnold Schwarzenegger. In 1994, Stone appeared as the wife of an architect opposite Richard Gere in the drama \"Intersection\", and as a woman who entices a bomb expert she is involved with into destroying the criminal gang that killed her family, alongside Sylvester Stallone, in the action thriller \"The Specialist\". While \"Intersection\" found limited success, \"The Specialist\" made US$170.3\u00a0million worldwide. For her work in both films, she won a Golden Raspberry Award and a Stinkers Bad Movie Award for Worst Actress, but was nominated for the MTV Movie Award for Most Desirable Female for \"The Specialist\".\nIn \"The Quick and the Dead\" (1995), Stone took on the role of a gunfighter who returns to a frontier town in an effort to avenge her father's death. She served as a producer on the film and had some creative control over the production; she chose director Sam Raimi, after being impressed by his work on \"Army of Darkness\", and co-star Russell Crowe after watching \"Romper Stomper\". She paid Leonardo DiCaprio's salary herself after a reluctance from Sony, the film's studio, over his casting. \"The Quick and the Dead\" was a modest profit and earned Stone a Saturn Award nomination for Best Actress. Stone starred opposite Robert De Niro in Martin Scorsese's epic crime drama \"Casino\" (1995), where she took on the role of Ginger McKenna, the scheming, self-absorbed wife of a top gambling handicapper (De Niro). The film, based on the non-fiction book \"\" by Nicholas Pileggi, received widespread critical acclaim, made US$116.1\u00a0million globally, and earned her the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress. During an interview with \"The Observer\", published on January 28, 1996, Stone said of the response: \"Thank God. I mean just finally, wow [...] I am not getting any younger. It couldn't have happened at a better time\". That year, she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, located at 6925 Hollywood Blvd, and was awarded the Women in Film Crystal Award.\nStone portrayed the mistress of a cruel school master in the psychological thriller \"Diabolique\" (1996), a woman waiting on death row for a brutal double murder in the drama \"Last Dance\" (1996), and a biologist in the suspense film \"Sphere\" (1998). The three aforementioned films were panned by critics and failed to find an audience in theaters. In 1998, Stone also lent her voice for the successful animated film \"Antz\", and played the mother of a 13-year-old boy suffering from Morquio syndrome in the drama \"The Mighty\", which garnered a positive critical response. Stone was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the lattermost.\nHer turn as a street-wise, middle-aged moll in \"Gloria\" (1999), a remake of the 1980 film of the same name, proved to be a critical and commercial misfire. A titular role followed in 1999 with the comedy \"The Muse\", playing the inspiration of an esteemed screenwriter. Wade Major, a critic for \"Boxoffice\", found her portrayal of a \"dizzy Muse\" to be \"the film's most delightful surprise\", but most reviews were ultimately lukewarm. Helmut Voss, then president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which gave the annual Golden Globe Awards, ordered all 82 of its members to return gift luxury watches sent by either Stone or October Films (now merged into Focus Features) as these were considered to be promotions for a nomination for Stone's performance in the film. She ultimately received the nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Comedy or Musical.\nHiatus and downturn (2000\u20132004).\nIn 2000, Stone played a lesbian trying to start a family, opposite Ellen DeGeneres, in the HBO television film \"If These Walls Could Talk 2\" and starred as an exotic dancer, alongside Billy Connolly, in the comedy \"Beautiful Joe\". While she was recognized by Women in Film with her second Lucy Award for her performance in \"If These Walls Could Talk 2\", \"Beautiful Joe\" premiered on cable television instead of receiving a theatrical release in North America. Nathan Rabin of \"The A.V. Club\", who had been critical of Stone's previous films, wrote that \"nothing she's done has been quite as shameless or appalling as \"Beautiful Joe\", a toxic piece of whimsy that ranks among the worst films of 2000\".\nFollowing her September 2001 hospitalization for a subarachnoid hemorrhage, Stone took a hiatus from screen acting. She faced professional challenges as she was in the process of recovery. She felt that she had \"lost [her] place\" in Hollywood, and during a 2015 interview with \"USA Today\", she remarked: \"[When] you find yourself at the back of the line in your business, as I did, [you] have to figure yourself out all over again.\" She returned to the screen in 2003, when she took on a three-episode arc as Sheila Carlisle, an attorney who believes she can communicate with God, in the eighth season of \"The Practice\". For her performance, she received the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series.\nStone attempted a return to the mainstream with roles in the films \"Cold Creek Manor\" (2003), with Dennis Quaid, and \"Catwoman\" (2004), with Halle Berry. In the mystery psychological thriller \"Cold Creek Manor\", she and Quaid played a couple terrorized by the former owner of the rural estate they bought in foreclosure. \"Variety\" magazine remarked in its review for the film that both actors \"fish in vain to find any angles to play in their dimension-free characters\". The superhero film \"Catwoman\" saw her play the age-obsessed CEO of a cosmetic company and the story's antagonist. While both films flopped at the box office, \"Catwoman\" is considered by many critics to be one of the worst movies of all time.\nIndependent films and ensemble dramas (2005\u20132017).\nHer next film release was Jim Jarmusch's dramedy \"Broken Flowers\" (2005), in which Stone took on the role of a grasping and overly eager closet organizer who re-connects with a former womanizer (played by Bill Murray). Unlike her previous few film outings, \"Broken Flowers\" was met with critical acclaim, upon its premiere at Cannes, where it was nominated for the Palme d'Or and won the Grand Prix. \"Far Out Magazine\" ranked Stone's role among one of her \"10 best performances\", while \"New York Magazine\" remarked: \"Sharon Stone, playing a widow who's half-hippie, half-working-class-tough, demonstrates that, given the right part, she's still not merely sexy but knockabout funny and sly\". In 2005, she was named Officer of the Order of Arts and Letters in France.\nAfter years of litigation, \"Basic Instinct 2\" was released on March 31, 2006. A reason for a long delay in releasing the film was reportedly Stone's dispute with the filmmakers over the nudity in the film; she wanted more while they wanted less. Stone told an interviewer, \"We are in a time of odd repression and if a popcorn movie allows us to create a platform for discussion, wouldn't that be great?\" Despite an estimated budget of US$70 million, \"Basic Instinct 2\" placed only tenth in gross on its opening weekend with a meager US$3.2 million and finished with a total domestic gross of under US$6\u00a0million. Stone appeared in Nick Cassavetes's crime drama \"Alpha Dog\" (2006), opposite Bruce Willis, playing Olivia Mazursky, the mother of a real-life murder victim; she wore a fatsuit for the role. The film premiered at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival and was an arthouse success. She made part of an ensemble cast in Emilio Estevez's drama \"Bobby\" (2006), about the hours leading up to the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy. Stone received favorable comments for her performance, particularly a scene alongside Lindsay Lohan. As a member of the cast, she was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture, but won in the Hollywood Film Festival Award for Best Ensemble Cast.\nStone took on the role of a clinically depressed woman in the independent drama \"When a Man Falls in the Forest\" (2007), which premiered in competition at the 57th Berlin International Film Festival where it was nominated for the Golden Bear. All of her late 2000s films \u2014\"If I Had Known I Was a Genius\" (2007), \"The Year of Getting to Know Us\" (2008), \"Five Dollars a Day\" (2009) and \"Streets of Blood\" (2009)\u2014 were direct-to-DVD releases in North America. In 2010, Stone made guest-appearances in four episodes of \"\", portraying Jo Marlowe, a former cop turned prosecutor. \"Entertainment Weekly\" included in a review such descriptions of her performance as a \"great presence\", and having \"had to revive her best [...] tone to sell hokey lines\" in a series it described as \"mawkish and overwrought\". She took on the leading female role in the French action sequel \"Largo Winch II\" as a United Nations investigator named Diane Francken. Her first theatrical-released production since 2007, the film premiered on February 16, 2011, in France, where it opened in second place at the box office. She next starred as a hard-hitting journalist in the thriller \"Border Run\" (2012), which received a direct-to-DVD release.\nIn 2013, Stone played the mother of porn actress Linda Lovelace (Amanda Seyfried) in the biographical drama \"Lovelace\", and a dermatologist seeking a \"m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois\" in the Woody Allen\u2013John Turturro comedy \"Fading Gigolo\". Both films were released in limited theaters to a decent critical reception; Glenn Kenny, in his review for \"Fading Gigolo\", found Stone to be \"splendidly understated\" in what he described as \"a New York story through and through [...] often funny, sometimes moving, occasionally goofy as hell\". In 2014, she starred as an actress-turned-publisher, opposite Riccardo Scamarcio, in the Italian dramedy \"A Golden Boy\" (\"Un ragazzo d'oro\"), directed by Pupi Avati, and portrayed America's first female Vice President in the TNT action drama series \"Agent X\", which only aired for one season. Stone next played an adoptive mother in the drama \"Mothers and Daughters\" (2016), a \"lineman widow\" and the \"alcoholic mom\" of a high-wire worker in the action film \"Life on the Line\" (2016), and a greedy billionaire in the drama \"Running Wild\" (2017). These three films all received a VOD release, to varying responses. James Franco's biographical comedy \"The Disaster Artist\" (2017), which featured Stone as Iris Burton, the agent of actor Greg Sestero, was a critical and commercial success, and was chosen by the National Board of Review as one of the top ten films of 2017.\nFilm and television balance (2018\u2013present).\nStone returned to television in 2018, when she portrayed a murdered children's book author and illustrator in Steven Soderbergh's HBO mystery production \"Mosaic\", which was released as an iOS/Android mobile app serving as an interactive film and as a television drama. She received positive reviews for her performance. Maureen Ryan of \"Variety\" felt that the actress \"displays terrific range and depth\" and \"holds the screen with effortless charisma\", and Nick Schager of \"The Daily Beast\" wrote that \"Stone's turn is something close to masterful.\" She earned the Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Series, Miniseries, or Television Film.\nIn \"\" (2019), a pseudo-documentary film covering Bob Dylan's 1975 Rolling Thunder Revue concert tour, Stone played an exaggerated version of herself. The film was released on Netflix, to critical acclaim. Owen Gleiberman described her appearance as a \"marketing hook\" and further stated: \"The presence of Sharon Stone embodies the spirit of [the Hollywood] machine. She has always been a good actress (probably better than many know; just watch her in \"Casino\"), but her fame will forever rest on a certain crudely riveting but debased high-budget exploitation thriller\". She reunited with Soderbergh for \"The Laundromat\" (2019), in which she played a harried realtor, opposite Meryl Streep.\nIn Netflix's psychological thriller series \"Ratched\" (2020), a prequel to Milo\u0161 Forman's 1975 film \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" developed by Ryan Murphy, Stone portrayed a wealthy heiress who hires a hit man to kill a doctor for disfiguring her son. Intrigued by Murphy's pitch for her character, which he wrote for her, Stone described the part as \"completely insane. And at the same time she thinks she's really a loving mother who has her shit together\". The series garnered a decent critical response and was viewed by 48 million people in its first four weeks of release. In 2020 Stone appeared as herself in an introduction to the fifth episode of \"The New Pope\", where she had an audience with John Malkovich as Pope John Paul III.\nIn 2021, she also appeared as herself in the dramedy \"Here Today\", directed by Billy Crystal, and was cast in the romantic drama \"Beauty\", directed by Andrew Dosunmu for Netflix.\nPublic image.\nIn media and fashion.\nFor her leading roles in erotic and adult-themed feature films such as \"Basic Instinct\", \"Sliver\", and \"The Specialist\", Stone cemented what was described as a \"tough-talking, no-underwear, voyeuristic, cool-as-ice, sex symbol\" status during the 1990s. She has appeared on the covers and pictorials of over 300 celebrity and fashion magazines throughout her four-decade acting career. She graced the June\u2013July 1986 cover of French \"Vogue\", and to coincide with the release of \"Total Recall\", she posed nude for the July 1990 issue of \"Playboy\", flaunting the muscles she had developed in preparation for the film. Following \"Basic Instinct\", photographer George Hurrell took a series of photographs of Stone, Sherilyn Fenn, Julian Sands, Raquel Welch, Eric Roberts, and Sean Penn. Stone, who was Hurrell's reportedly last sitting before his death in 1992, is also a collector of the photographer's original prints and wrote the foreword to the book \"Hurrell's Hollywood\". In 1993, she appeared in Pirelli's commercial, \"Driving Instinct\", in 2005, became the face of Dior's Capture skincare line, and in 2016, starred with Paul Sculfor in Airfield's () \"Fashion Is a Lovestory\" short film.\nStone's public and professional profiles have been strongly tied to her appearance and sex appeal. She has ranked among the \"50 most beautiful people in the world\" by \"People\" in 1992, the \"100 sexiest stars in film history\" by \"Empire\" in 1995 and 1997, and the \"25 sexiest stars of the century\" by \"Playboy\" in 1999. She has also been the subject of four television documentary specials, and several biographies have been written about her.\n On her sex symbol image, Stone told Oprah Winfrey on \"Oprah Prime\" in 2014: \"It's a pleasure for me now. I mean, I'm gonna be 56 years old. If people want to think I'm a sex symbol, it's, like, yeah. Think it up. You know. I mean, like, good for me\". She posed nude for the September 2015 issue of \"Harper's Bazaar\", in which she stated: \"At a certain point you start asking yourself, 'What really is sexy?' It's not just the elevation of your boobs. It's being present and having fun and liking yourself enough to like the person that's with you\".\nCriticism.\nOn January 28, 2005, Stone helped solicit pledges for $1\u00a0million in five minutes for mosquito nets in Tanzania, turning a panel on African poverty into an impromptu fundraiser at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Many observers, including UNICEF, criticized her actions by claiming that Stone had reacted instinctively to the words of Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa, because she had not done her research on the causes, consequences, and methods of preventing malaria. Of the $1\u00a0million pledged, only $250,000 was actually raised. In order to fulfill the promise to send $1\u00a0million worth of bed nets to Tanzania, UNICEF contributed $750,000. This diverted funds from other UNICEF projects. According to prominent economist Xavier Sala-i-Martin, officials are largely unaware of what happened with the bed nets. Some were delivered to the local airport. These reportedly were stolen and later resurfaced as wedding dresses on the local black market.\nStone was criticized over her comments in an exchange on the red carpet with Hong Kong's \"Cable Entertainment News\" during the 2008 Cannes Film Festival on May 25, 2008. When asked about the 2008 Sichuan earthquake she remarked:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Well you know it was very interesting because at first, you know, I'm not happy about the way the Chinese are treating the Tibetans because I don't think anyone should be unkind to anyone else. And so I have been very concerned about how to think and what to do about that because I don't like that. And I had been this, you know, concerned about, oh how should we deal with the Olympics because they are not being nice to the Dalai Lama, who is a good friend of mine. And then this earthquake and all this stuff happened, and then I thought, is that karma? When you're not nice that the bad things happen to you?\nOne of China's biggest cinema chains reacted to Stone's comments by declaring it would not show her films in its theaters. The founder of the UME Cineplex chain and the chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong Filmmakers, Ng See-yuen, called Stone's comments \"inappropriate\", and said the UME Cineplex chain would no longer present her films. Dior advertisements featuring Stone's image were dropped from all ads in China amid the public uproar. Stone was removed from the 2008 Shanghai International Film Festival guest list, and the event's organizers considered banning the actress permanently. Dior China had originally posted an apology in Stone's name, but Stone later denied making the apology during an interview with \"The New York Times\", saying \"I'm not going to apologize. I'm certainly not going to apologize for something that isn't real and true\u00a0\u2013 not for face creams,\" although she did admit that she had \"sounded like an idiot.\" However, after the interview, Stone released a statement entitled \"In my own words by Sharon Stone\" in which she said \"I could not be more regretful of that mistake. It was unintentional. I apologize. Those words were never meant to be hurtful to anyone.\"\nPersonal life.\nStone is a Tibetan Buddhist, having been converted to Buddhism when Richard Gere introduced her to the Dalai Lama. She has said she believes in God.\nOn September 29, 2001, Stone was hospitalized for a subarachnoid hemorrhage, which was diagnosed as a vertebral artery dissection rather than the more common ruptured aneurysm, and treated with an endovascular coil embolization. She has stated while she was sick people took advantage of her and stole $18 million from her. She nearly went broke.\nRelationships and family.\nIn 1984, she met television producer Michael Greenburg on the set of \"The Vegas Strip War\", a television film he produced and she starred in. They married the same year. In 1986, Greenburg was her line producer on \"Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold\". The couple separated three years later, and their divorce was finalized in 1990.\nStone and comedian Garry Shandling were students of acting coach Roy London and dated briefly. She appeared on his show \"The Larry Sanders Show\" in the episode \"The Mr. Sharon Stone Show\". They remained close friends until Shandling's death in 2016.\nIn 1993, Stone met William J. MacDonald on the set of the film \"Sliver\", which he co-produced. MacDonald left his wife for Stone and became engaged to her. They separated one year later in 1994. After they separated, Stone returned the engagement ring via FedEx. While working on the film \"The Quick and the Dead\" in 1994, Stone met Bob Wagner, a first assistant director, and they became engaged.\nOn February 14, 1998, Stone married Phil Bronstein, executive editor of \"The San Francisco Examiner\" and later \"San Francisco Chronicle\". Stone suffered several miscarriages due to an autoimmune disease and endometriosis and was unable to have children. They adopted a son in 2000. Bronstein filed for divorce in 2003, citing irreconcilable differences. The divorce became final in 2004, with a judge ruling that their son should remain primarily with Bronstein, and Stone would have visitation rights.\nStone adopted her second son in 2005 and her third son in 2006. As of 2018, Stone resides with her three sons in West Hollywood, California, in a home once owned by the actor Montgomery Clift.\nActivism.\nIn March 2006, Stone traveled to Israel to promote peace in the Middle East through a press conference with Nobel Peace Prize winner and former prime minister of Israel Shimon Peres. In 2013, she referred to Peres, who was then serving as the president of Israel, as her \"mentor\". On October 23, 2013, Stone received the Peace Summit Award for her work for people with HIV/AIDS.\nIn 2015, Stone was guest of honor at the Pilosio Building Peace Award in Milan. She began an impromptu auction on stage in front of a crowd of CEOs from the construction industry and other dignitaries. She gained enough pledges to build 28 schools in Africa.\nSelected filmography and accolades.\nIn a career spanning over four decades, Stone has had over one hundred acting credits in film and on television. She has won 10 awards from 41 nominations, including one Golden Globe Award (for \"Casino\"), one Primetime Emmy Award (for \"The Practice\"), and two MTV Movie Awards (for \"Basic Instinct\"). Her top-billing roles and most notable films as of 2019[ [update]] include:\nIn December 2024, Sharon Stone was included on the BBC's \"100 Women\" list.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "43085", "revid": "96647", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43085", "title": "Rutile", "text": "Oxide mineral composed of titanium dioxide\nRutile is an oxide mineral composed of titanium dioxide (TiO2), the most common natural form of TiO2. Rarer polymorphs of TiO2 are known, including anatase, akaogiite, and brookite.\nRutile has one of the highest refractive indices at visible wavelengths of any known crystal and also exhibits a particularly large birefringence and high dispersion. Owing to these properties, it is useful for the manufacture of certain optical elements, especially polarization optics, for longer visible and infrared wavelengths up to about 4.5 micrometres. Natural rutile may contain up to 10% iron and significant amounts of niobium and tantalum.\nRutile derives its name from the Latin ('red'), in reference to the deep red color observed in some specimens when viewed by transmitted light. Rutile was first described in 1803 by Abraham Gottlob Werner using specimens obtained in Horcajuelo de la Sierra, Madrid (Spain), which is consequently the type locality.\nOccurrence.\nRutile is a common accessory mineral in high-temperature and high-pressure metamorphic rocks and in igneous rocks.\nThermodynamically, rutile is the most stable polymorph of TiO2 at all temperatures, exhibiting lower total free energy than metastable phases of anatase or brookite. Consequently, the transformation of the metastable TiO2 polymorphs to rutile is irreversible. As it has the lowest molecular volume of the three main polymorphs, it is generally the primary titanium-bearing phase in most high-pressure metamorphic rocks, chiefly eclogites.\nWithin the igneous environment, rutile is a common accessory mineral in plutonic igneous rocks, though it is also found occasionally in extrusive igneous rocks, particularly those such as kimberlites and lamproites that have deep mantle sources. Anatase and brookite are found in the igneous environment, particularly as products of autogenic alteration during the cooling of plutonic rocks; anatase is also found in placer deposits sourced from primary rutile.\nThe occurrence of large specimen crystals is most common in pegmatites, skarns, and granite greisens. Rutile is found as an accessory mineral in some altered igneous rocks, and in certain gneisses and schists. In groups of acicular crystals it is frequently seen penetrating quartz as in the from Graub\u00fcnden, Switzerland. In 2005 the Republic of Sierra Leone in West Africa had a production capacity of 23% of the world's annual rutile supply, which rose to approximately 30% in 2008.\nCrystal structure.\nThe structure of rutile is so classic that it is discussed in textbooks as a reference motif, much like sodium chloride and nickel arsenide. The structure is adopted by not only TiO2, but also by GeO2, RuO2, SnO2, MnO2, VO2, IrO2, and CrO2. ZrO2 and HfO2 adopt another classical structural motif, the fluorite structure.\nIn the rutile motif, the metal \"cations\" have a coordination number of 6, meaning they are surrounded by an octahedron of 6 oxygen atoms. The oxygen anions have a coordination number of 3, in a trigonal planar coordination. Rutile also shows a screw axis when its octahedra are viewed sequentially. When formed under reducing conditions, oxygen vacancies can occur, coupled to Ti3+ centers. Hydrogen can enter these gaps, existing as an individual vacancy occupant (pairing as a hydrogen ion) or creating a hydroxide group with an adjacent oxygen.\nRutile crystals are most commonly observed to exhibit a prismatic or acicular growth habit with preferential orientation along their \"c\" axis, the [001] direction. This growth habit is favored as the {110} facets of rutile exhibit the lowest surface free energy and are therefore thermodynamically most stable. The \"c\"-axis oriented growth of rutile appears clearly in nanorods, nanowires and abnormal grain growth phenomena of this phase.\nApplication.\nIn large enough quantities in beach sands, rutile forms an important constituent of heavy minerals and ore deposits. Miners extract and separate the valuable minerals\u00a0\u2013\u00a0e.g., rutile, zircon, and ilmenite. The main uses for rutile are the manufacture of refractory ceramic, as a pigment, and for the production of titanium metal.\nFinely powdered rutile is a brilliant white pigment and is used in paints, plastics, paper, foods, and other applications that call for a bright white color. Titanium dioxide pigment is the single greatest use of titanium worldwide. Nanoscale particles of rutile are transparent to visible light but are highly effective in the absorption of ultraviolet radiation (sunscreen). The UV absorption of nano-sized rutile particles is blue-shifted compared to bulk rutile so that higher-energy UV light is absorbed by the nanoparticles. Hence, they are used in sunscreens to protect against UV-induced skin damage.\nSmall rutile needles present in gems are responsible for an optical phenomenon known as asterism. Asteriated gems are known as \"star\" gems. Star sapphires, star rubies, and other star gems are highly sought after and are generally more valuable than their normal counterparts.\nRutile is widely used as a welding electrode covering. It is also used as a part of the ZTR index, which classifies highly weathered sediments.\nSemiconductor.\nRutile, as a large band-gap semiconductor, has in recent decades been the subject of significant research towards applications as a functional oxide for applications in photocatalysis and dilute magnetism. Research efforts typically utilize small quantities of synthetic rutile rather than mineral-deposit derived materials.\nSynthetic rutile.\nSynthetic rutile was first produced in 1948 and is sold under a variety of names. It can be produced from the titanium ore ilmenite through the Becher process. Very pure synthetic rutile is transparent and almost colorless, being slightly yellow, in large pieces. Synthetic rutile can be made in a variety of colors by doping. The high refractive index gives an adamantine luster and strong refraction that leads to a diamond-like appearance. The near-colorless diamond substitute is sold as \"Titania\", which is the old-fashioned chemical name for this oxide. However, rutile is seldom used in jewellery because it is not very hard (scratch-resistant), measuring only about 6 on the Mohs hardness scale.\nAs the result of growing research interest in the photocatalytic activity of titanium dioxide, in both anatase and rutile phases (as well as biphasic mixtures of the two phases), rutile TiO2 in powder and thin film form is frequently fabricated in laboratory conditions through solution based routes using inorganic precursors (typically TiCl4) or organometallic precursors (typically alkoxides such as titanium isopropoxide, also known as TTIP). Depending on synthesis conditions, the first phase to crystallize may be the metastable anatase phase, which can then be converted to the equilibrium rutile phase through thermal treatment. The physical properties of rutile are often modified using dopants to impart improved photocatalytic activity through improved photo-generated charge carrier separation, altered electronic band structures and improved surface reactivity.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In popular culture, the legacy of Project Mogul has been the Roswell incident, in which a crashed Mogul balloon was mistaken for an extraterrestrial spacecraft, giving rise to a persistent UFO legend.\nProject history.\nThe project was carried out from 1947 until early 1949. It was a classified portion of an unclassified project by New York University (NYU) atmospheric researchers. The project was moderately successful, but was very expensive and was superseded by a network of seismic detectors and air sampling for fallout, which were cheaper, more reliable, and easier to deploy and operate.\nProject Mogul was conceived by Maurice Ewing who had earlier researched the deep sound channel in the oceans and theorized that a similar sound channel existed in the upper atmosphere: a certain height where the air pressure and temperature result in minimal speed of sound, so that sound waves would propagate and stay in that channel due to refraction. The project involved arrays of balloons carrying disc microphones and radio transmitters to relay the signals to the ground. It was supervised by James Peoples, who was assisted by Albert P. Crary.\nOne of the requirements of the balloons was that they maintain a relatively constant altitude over a prolonged period of time. Thus instrumentation had to be developed to maintain such constant altitudes, such as pressure sensors controlling the release of ballast.\nThe early Mogul balloons consisted of large clusters of rubber meteorological balloons, however, these were quickly replaced by enormous balloons made of polyethylene plastic. These were more durable, leaked less helium, and also were better at maintaining a constant altitude than the early rubber balloons. Constant-altitude-control and polyethylene balloons were the two major innovations of Project Mogul.\nSubsequent programs.\nProject Mogul was the forerunner of the Skyhook balloon program, which started in the late 1940s, as well as two other espionage programs involving balloon overflights and photographic surveillance of the Soviet Union during the 1950s, Project Moby Dick and Project Genetrix. The spy balloon overflights raised storms of protest from the Soviets. The constant-altitude balloons also were used for scientific purposes such as cosmic ray experiments. \nFurther development of nuclear detonation detection systems was extensive for decades afterward, culminating in worldwide systems by various countries to keep eyes and ears on detecting and verifying the others' nuclear weapon developments. \nThere would also be fixed-wing United States aerial reconnaissance of the Soviet Union during the 1950s. Overflights ended after the 1960 U-2 incident when an aircraft was shot down by SAMs. Reconnaissance would for decades afterward be handled mostly by reconnaissance satellites and to some extent by aircraft, such as the A-12 OXCART and SR-71 Blackbird (photography and radar) and RC-135U and similar aircraft (SIGINT including ELINT and COMINT).\nRoswell incident.\nIn 1947, a Project Mogul balloon \"NYU Flight 4\", launched June 4, crashed in the desert near Roswell, New Mexico. The subsequent military cover-up of the true nature of the balloon and burgeoning conspiracy theories from UFO enthusiasts led to a celebrated \"UFO\" incident.\nUnlike a weather balloon, the Project Mogul paraphernalia were massive and contained unusual types of materials, according to research conducted by \"The New York Times\": \"...squadrons of big balloons ... It was like having an elephant in your backyard and hoping that no one would notice it. ... To the untrained eye, the reflectors looked extremely odd, a geometrical hash of lightweight sticks and sharp angles made of metal foil. .. photographs of it, taken in 1947 and published in newspapers, show bits and pieces of what are obviously collapsed balloons and radar reflectors.\"\nLegacy.\nImplementation of Mogul's experimental infrasound detection of nuclear tests exist today in ground-based detectors, part of so-called Geophysical MASINT (measurement and signal intelligence). In 2013, this world-wide network of sound detectors picked up the large explosion of the Chelyabinsk meteor in Russia. The strength of the sound waves was used to estimate the size of the explosion.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He played 19 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) (1946\u20131963, 1965), all but the last for the New York Yankees. He was an 18-time All-Star and won 10 World Series championships as a player\u2014more than any other player in MLB history. Berra had a career batting average of .285, while hitting 358 home runs and 1,430 runs batted in. He is one of only six players to win the American League Most Valuable Player Award three times. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest catchers in baseball history, and was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1972.\nBerra was born in St. Louis, in an Italian community, and signed with the Yankees in 1943 before serving in the United States Navy as a gunner's mate in the Normandy landings during World War II. He made his major-league debut at age 21 in 1946 and was a mainstay in the Yankees' lineup during the team's championship years beginning in 1949 and continuing through 1962. Berra was a power hitter and strong defensive catcher, despite being shorter than most in the league at tall. Berra played 18 seasons with the Yankees before retiring after the 1963 season. He spent the next year as their manager, then joined the New York Mets in 1965 as coach (and briefly a player again). Berra remained with the Mets for the next decade, serving the last four years as their manager. He returned to the Yankees in 1976, coaching them for eight seasons and managing for two, before coaching the Houston Astros. Berra appeared as a player, coach or manager in 13 of 15 World Series that New York baseball teams won from 1947 through 1981. Overall, he played or coached in 21 World Series, 13 on the winning side. Berra caught Don Larsen's perfect game in game five of the 1956 World Series. He also holds the all-time record for shutouts caught with 173.\nThe Yankees retired his uniform number 8 in 1972; Bill Dickey had previously worn number 8, and both catchers had that number retired by the Yankees. The club honored him with a plaque in Monument Park in 1988. Berra was named to the MLB All-Century Team in a vote by fans in 1999. For the remainder of his life, he was closely involved with the Yogi Berra Museum and Learning Center, which he opened on the campus of Montclair State University in 1998. Berra quit school after the eighth grade. He was known for his malapropisms as well as pithy and paradoxical statements, such as \"It ain't over 'til it's over\" and \"I really didn't say everything I said.\"\nEarly life.\nBerra was born Lorenzo Pietro Berra in a primarily Italian neighborhood of St. Louis called The Hill on May 12, 1925. His parents were Italian immigrants Pietro and Paolina (n\u00e9e\u00a0Longoni) Berra. Pietro was originally from Malvaglio near Milan; he arrived at Ellis Island on October 18, 1909, at the age of 23. In a 2005 interview for the Baseball Hall of Fame, Berra said, \"My father came over first. He came from the old country. And he didn't know what baseball was. He was ready to go to work. And then I had three other brothers and a sister. My brother and my mother came over later on. My two oldest brothers, they were born there\u2014Mike and Tony. John and I and my sister Josie were born in St. Louis.\"\nBerra's parents originally gave him the nickname \"Lawdie\", which was derived from his mother's difficulty pronouncing \"Lawrence\" or \"Larry\" correctly. He grew up on Elizabeth Avenue, across the street from boyhood friend and later competitor Joe Garagiola. That block was also home to Jack Buck early in his Cardinals broadcasting career, and it was later renamed \"Hall of Fame Place\". Berra was a Catholic, and he attended South Side Catholic, now called St. Mary's High School, in south St. Louis with Garagiola. Berra left school after the eighth grade due to a desire to work and assist the family\u2019s finances. He has been inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame.\nHe began playing baseball in local American Legion Baseball leagues, where he learned the basics of catching while playing both outfield and infield positions. While playing in American Legion Baseball, he received the nickname \"Yogi\" from his friend Jack Maguire, who, after seeing a newsreel about India, said that he resembled a yogi from India whenever he sat around with arms and legs crossed waiting to bat or while looking sad after a losing game.\nProfessional baseball career.\nMinor leagues.\nIn 1942, the St. Louis Cardinals overlooked Berra in favor of his boyhood best friend, Joe Garagiola. On the surface, the Cardinals seemed to think that Garagiola was the superior prospect, but team president Branch Rickey actually had an ulterior motive. Rickey already knew that he was going to leave St. Louis to take over the operation of the Brooklyn Dodgers and was more impressed with Berra than he let on; he apparently had planned to hold Berra off until he could sign him for the Dodgers. However, the Yankees signed Berra for the same $500 bonus ($ in current dollar terms) the Cardinals offered Garagiola before Rickey could sign Berra to the Dodgers. Berra played for the Norfolk Tars in 1943.\nWorld War II and subsequent return to baseball.\nBerra joined the United States Navy in 1943, and served as a gunner's mate on the attack transport during the Normandy landings. A seaman second class, Berra was one of a six-man crew on a Navy rocket boat, firing machine guns and launching rockets at the German defenses on Omaha Beach. He was wounded and awarded a Purple Heart medal. During an interview on the 65th Anniversary of D-Day, Berra confirmed that he was sent to Utah Beach during the D-Day invasion as well. His military records were burned in the St. Louis Archives fire in 1973.\nFollowing Operation Dragoon, he was sent to Tunisia before returning to the United States in January 1945 and being stationed at Naval Submarine Base New London. While there, he played for the base's semi-pro baseball team. He also bribed guards to allow him to sneak off base and play for the Cranston, Rhode Island, Chiefs for $50 a game under an assumed name, as he was already signed with the Yankees. He was honorably discharged in May 1946.\nFollowing his military service, Berra played minor-league baseball with the Newark Bears, surprising the team's manager with his talent despite his short stature. He was mentored by Hall of Famer Bill Dickey, whose uniform number Berra took. He later said, \"I owe everything I did in baseball to Bill Dickey.\"\nMajor leagues.\nBerra was called up to the Yankees and played his first game on September 22, 1946; he played 7 games that season and 83 games in 1947. He played in more than a hundred games in each of the following 14 years. Berra appeared in 14 World Series, including 10 World Series championships, both of which are records. In part because Berra's playing career coincided with the Yankees' most consistent period of World Series participation, he established Series records for the most games (75), at bats (259), hits (71), doubles (10), singles (49), games caught (63), and catcher putouts (457). In Game 3 of the 1947 World Series, Berra hit the first pinch-hit home run in World Series history, off Brooklyn Dodgers pitcher Ralph Branca (who later gave up Bobby Thomson's famous Shot Heard 'Round the World in 1951).\nBerra was an All-Star for 15 seasons, and was selected to 18 All-Star Games (MLB held two All-Star Games in 1959 through 1962). He won the American League (AL) MVP award in 1951, 1954, and 1955; Berra never finished lower than fourth in the MVP voting from 1950 to 1957. He received MVP votes in 15 consecutive seasons, tied with Barry Bonds and second only to Hank Aaron's 19 straight seasons with MVP support. From 1949 to 1955, on a team filled with stars such as Mickey Mantle and Joe DiMaggio, it was Berra who led the Yankees in RBI for seven consecutive seasons. Probably the most notable game of Berra's playing career came when he caught Don Larsen's perfect game in the 1956 World Series, the first of only three no-hitters, and lone \"perfecto\" ever thrown in MLB postseason play. The picture of Berra leaping into Larsen's arms following Dale Mitchell's called third strike to end the game is one of the sport's most memorable images.\nPlaying style.\nBerra was excellent at hitting pitches outside of the strike zone, covering all areas of the strike zone (as well as beyond) with great extension. In addition to this wide plate coverage, he also had great bat control. He was able both to swing the bat like a golf club to hit low pitches for deep home runs and to chop at high pitches for line drives. Whether changing speeds or location, pitcher Early Wynn soon discovered that \"Berra moves right with you.\" Five times, Berra had more home runs than strikeouts in a season, striking out just twelve times in 597 at-bats in 1950. The combination of bat control and plate coverage made Berra a feared \"clutch hitter\", proclaimed by rival manager Paul Richards \"the toughest man in the league in the last three innings\". Contrasting him with teammate Mickey Mantle, Wynn declared Berra \"the real toughest clutch hitter\", grouping him with Cleveland slugger Al Rosen as \"the two best clutch hitters in the game\".\nAs a catcher, Berra was outstanding: quick, mobile, and a great handler of pitchers, Berra led all American League catchers eight times in games caught and in chances accepted, six times in double plays (a major-league record), eight times in putouts, three times in assists, and once in fielding percentage. Berra left the game with the AL records for catcher putouts (8,723) and chances accepted (9,520). He was also one of only four catchers ever to field 1.000 in a season, playing 88 errorless games in 1958. He was the first catcher to leave one finger outside his glove, a style that most other catchers eventually emulated. Tom Sturdivant, who pitched for the Yankees from 1955 to 1959, said \"I can't say enough for Yogi Berra. It gives a young pitcher a lot of confidence to have a fellow like Berra calling the pitches. No one could set up the hitters better.\"\nAt age 37 in June 1962, Berra showed his superb physical endurance by catching an entire 22-inning, seven-hour game against the Detroit Tigers. Casey Stengel, Berra's manager during most of his playing career with the Yankees and with the Mets in 1965, once said, \"I never play a game without my man.\" Later in his career, Berra became a good defensive outfielder in Yankee Stadium's notoriously difficult left field.\nYankee manager and harmonica incident.\nAfter spending as a player-coach\u2014he appeared in 64 games (35 as a catcher and 29 as a pinch hitter, batting .293 in 164 at bats), and held down the Yankee's first-base coaching job otherwise\u2014Berra retired as an active player after the 1963 World Series and was immediately named to succeed Ralph Houk as manager of the Yankees.\nThe so-called Harmonica Incident occurred aboard the team bus in August 1964. Following a loss, infielder Phil Linz was playing his harmonica, and Berra ordered him to stop. Seated on the other end of the bus, Linz could not hear what Berra had said, and Mickey Mantle impishly informed Linz, \"He said to play it louder.\" When Linz did so, an angry Berra slapped the harmonica out of his hands.\nAll was apparently forgotten when the Yankees rode a September surge to return to the World Series, but the team lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games, after which Berra was fired. Houk, who was general manager at the time, later said the decision to fire Berra was made in late August and that the incident with Linz had nothing to do with it. Although he did not elaborate, Houk said that he and the rest of the Yankee brain trust did not feel Berra was ready to manage. Players, however, said the incident actually solidified his managerial authority and helped him lead them to the Series.\nCoach of the New York Mets and Houston Astros.\nBerra was immediately signed by the crosstown New York Mets as a coach. He also put in four cameo appearances as a catcher early in the season. His last at-bat came on May 9, 1965, three days shy of his 40th birthday. Berra stayed with the Mets as a coach under Stengel, Wes Westrum, Salty Parker, and Gil Hodges for the next seven seasons, including their 1969 World Series championship season. He then became the team's manager in 1972, following Hodges' unexpected death in spring training.\nThe following season looked like a disappointment at first. Injuries plagued the Mets throughout the season. Midway through the 1973 season, the Mets were stuck in last place but in a very tight divisional race. In July, when a reporter asked Yogi if the season was over, he replied, \"It ain't over 'til it's over.\"\nAs the Mets' key players came back to the lineup, a late surge allowed them to win the NL East despite an 82\u201379 record, making it the only time from 1970 through 1980 that the NL East was not won by either their rival Philadelphia Phillies or the Pittsburgh Pirates. When the Mets faced the 99-win Cincinnati Reds in the 1973 National League Championship Series, a memorable fight erupted between Bud Harrelson and Pete Rose in the top of the fifth inning of game three. After the incident and the ensuing bench-clearing brawl had subsided, fans began throwing objects at Rose when he returned to his position in left field in the bottom half of the inning. Sparky Anderson pulled Rose and his Reds off the field until order was restored. When National League president Chub Feeney threatened the Mets with a forfeit, Berra walked out to left field with Willie Mays, Tom Seaver, Rusty Staub, and Cleon Jones in order to plead with the fans to desist. Yogi's Mets went on to defeat the highly favored \"Big Red Machine\" in five games to capture the NL pennant. It was Berra's second as a manager, one in each league. The Mets fell to the Oakland Athletics in the 1973 World Series, but they went the distance in a close, seven-game, series.\nBerra's tenure as Mets manager ended with his firing on August 5, 1975. He had a record of 298 wins and 302 losses, which included the 1973 postseason. In 1976, he rejoined the Yankees as a coach. The team won its first of three consecutive AL titles, as well as the 1977 World Series and 1978 World Series, and (as had been the case throughout his playing days) Berra's reputation as a lucky charm was reinforced. Casey Stengel once said of his catcher, \"He'd fall in a sewer and come up with a gold watch.\" Berra was named Yankees manager before the 1984 season. Berra agreed to stay in the job for 1985 after receiving assurances that he would not be terminated, but impatient George Steinbrenner reneged, firing Berra anyway after the 16th game of the season. Moreover, instead of firing him personally, Steinbrenner dispatched Clyde King to deliver the news for him. The incident caused a rift between Berra and Steinbrenner that was not mended for almost 15 years.\nBerra joined the Houston Astros as bench coach in 1985, where he again made it to the NLCS in 1986. The Astros lost the series in six games to the Mets. Berra remained a coach in Houston for three more years, retiring after the 1989 season. He finished his managerial career with a regular-season record of 484\u2013444 and a playoff record of 9\u201310.\nAfter George Steinbrenner ventured to Berra's home in New Jersey to apologize in person for having mishandled Berra's firing as Yankee manager, Berra ended his 14-year estrangement from the Yankee organization in 1999 and worked in spring-training camp with catcher Jorge Posada.\nCareer statistics.\nIn 75 World Series games, Berra batted .274 (71-for-259) with 41 runs, 10 doubles, 12 home runs, 39 RBI, and 32 walks. He has accumulated the most hits (71) and plate appearances (295) of any MLB player in World Series history.\nSource:https://\nHonors.\nMilitary.\nDuring World War II, Berra served in the Navy as machine gunner participating in the D-Day invasion and earned a Purple Heart, Distinguished Unit Citation, two battle stars an American Campaign Medal, and a European\u2013African\u2013Middle Eastern Campaign Medal. In 2009, he received the Lone Sailor Award and, in 2010, he was honored with the Audie Murphy Award for his Navy service.\nMajor League Baseball.\nBerra was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1972, on his second ballot. That same year, his No. 8 was retired in 1972 by the Yankees, jointly honoring both Berra and Bill Dickey, his predecessor as the Yankees' star catcher.\nOn August 22, 1988, Berra and Dickey were honored with plaques to be hung in Monument Park at Yankee Stadium. Berra's plaque calls him \"A legendary Yankee\" and cites his most frequent quote, \"It ain't over till it's over\". However, the honor was not enough to shake Berra's conviction that Steinbrenner had broken their personal agreement; Berra did not set foot in the stadium for another decade, until Steinbrenner publicly apologized to Berra.\nIn 1996, Berra received an honorary doctorate from Montclair State University, which also named its own campus stadium Yogi Berra Stadium, opened in 1998, in his honor. The stadium is also used by the New Jersey Jackals, an independent minor league baseball team that has also paid homage to Berra by never issuing his jersey number, 8, to anyone.\nIn 1998, Berra appeared at No. 40 on \"The Sporting News\" list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and fan balloting elected him to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. In 2020, \"The Athletic\" ranked Berra at number 43 on its \"Baseball 100\" list, compiled by sportswriter Joe Posnanski.\nOn July 18, 1999, Berra was honored with \"Yogi Berra Day\" at Yankee Stadium. Don Larsen threw the ceremonial first pitch to Berra to honor the perfect game of the 1956 World Series. The celebration marked the return of Berra to the stadium. On that day, Yankees pitcher David Cone threw a perfect game against the Montreal Expos, only the 16th time it had ever been done in Major League history.\nIn 2005, Berra received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In 2008, Berra was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame.\nBerra was the inaugural recipient of the Bob Feller Act of Valor Award in 2013.\nYogi Berra Museum and Learning Center and Yogi Berra Stadium.\nIn 1998, the Yogi Berra Museum and Learning Center and Yogi Berra Stadium (home of the Montclair State University baseball team and formerly home to the New Jersey Jackals) opened on the campus of Montclair State University in Upper Montclair, New Jersey. The museum is the home of various artifacts, including the mitt with which Yogi caught the only perfect game in World Series history, several autographed and \"game-used\" items, and nine of Yogi's championship rings.\nBerra was involved with the project and frequently visited the museum for signings, discussions, and other events. It was his intention to teach children values such as sportsmanship and dedication on and off the baseball diamond.\nOn October 8, 2014, a break-in and theft occurred at the museum, and several of Berra's World Series rings and other memorabilia were stolen.\nPresidential Medal of Freedom.\nOn November 24, 2015, Berra was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom posthumously by President Barack Obama in a ceremony at the White House attended by members of Berra's family, who accepted the award on his behalf. At the ceremony, the President said: \"Today we celebrate some extraordinary people. Innovators, artists and leaders who contribute to America's strength as a nation.\" Celebrating Berra's military service and remarkable baseball career, Obama used one of Berra's famous \"Yogi-isms\", saying, \"One thing we know for sure: If you can't imitate him, don't copy him.\"\nUSPS stamp.\nOn July 1, 2021, the United States Postal Service officially issued its Yogi Berra commemorative stamp outside of Berra's museum. Berra is only the 30th baseball player to have his picture on a stamp, and he is the first player to appear on a USPS stamp in nine years. Berra is also the first player since Lou Gehrig in 1989 to receive an issuance all his own, where a great majority of those stamps have been part of multiplayer issuances.\nOther activities.\nBerra and former teammate Phil Rizzuto were partners in a bowling alley venture in Clifton, New Jersey, originally called Rizzuto-Berra Lanes. The two eventually sold their stakes to new owners, who changed the name to Astro Bowl before selling the property to a developer who closed the bowling alley in 1999 and converted it into retail space. Yogi Berra's Fitness &amp; Racquetball Club in Fairfield, New Jersey, was popular in the 1980s.\nBerra was also involved in causes related to his Italian American heritage. He was a longtime supporter of the National Italian American Foundation (NIAF) and helped fund raise for the Foundation. He was inducted into the Italian American Hall of Fame in 2004.\nBerra was a recipient of the Boy Scouts of America's highest adult award, the Silver Buffalo Award.\nBased on his style of speaking, Yogi was named \"Wisest Fool of the Past 50 Years\" by \"The Economist\" magazine in January 2005.\nIn the 2007 television miniseries \"The Bronx Is Burning\", Berra was portrayed by actor Joe Grifasi. In the HBO sports docudrama \"61*\", Berra was portrayed by actor Paul Borghese, and Hank Steinberg's script included more than one of Berra's famous \"Yogi-isms\". In 2009, Berra appeared in the documentary film \"A Time for Champions\", recounting his childhood memories of soccer in his native St. Louis. The 2022 documentary \"It Ain't Over\" focuses on Berra's life and career.\nYogi and his wife Carmen were played by real-life newly married actors Peter Scolari and Tracey Shayne in the 2013 Broadway play \"Bronx Bombers\".\nYogi joined Athlete Ally as a champion for inclusion in sports and as an Athlete Ally Pro Ambassador in 2013. The Yogi Berra Museum and Learning Center also collaborated with Athlete Ally on the innovative \"Championing Respect\" museum exhibit, which charted how sports has contributed to social change.\nPersonal life.\nBerra married Carmen Short on January 26, 1949. They had three sons and were longtime residents of Montclair, New Jersey, until Carmen's declining health caused them to move into a nearby assisted living facility in West Caldwell. Each of their sons played professional sports: Dale Berra played shortstop for the Pittsburgh Pirates, the New York Yankees (managed by Yogi in 1984\u201385), and the Houston Astros; Tim Berra played for the Baltimore Colts in the 1974 NFL season; and Larry Berra played for three minor league teams in the New York Mets organization. Carmen Berra died on March 6, 2014, of complications from a stroke, at age 85; the couple had recently celebrated their 65th anniversary. Following Carmen's death, the house in Montclair was listed for sale at $888,000, a reference to Yogi's uniform number.\nDeath.\nBerra died in his sleep at age 90 of natural causes in West Caldwell, New Jersey, on September 22, 2015.\nThe Yankees added a number \"8\" patch to their uniforms in honor of Berra, and the Empire State Building was lit with vertical blue and white Yankee \"pinstripes\" on September 23. New York City lowered all flags in the city to half-staff for a day in tribute. A moment of silence was held before the September 23 games of the Yankees, Dodgers, Astros, Mets, Nationals, Tigers, Pirates, and his hometown St. Louis Cardinals, as well as the ALPB's Long Island Ducks. The Yogi Berra Museum held a tribute on October 4.\nBerra's funeral services were held on September 29, and were broadcast by the YES Network. His ashes were interred next to his wife, Carmen, at the Gate of Heaven Cemetery in East Hanover, New Jersey. Berra's longtime friend, Joe Garagiola, who lived directly across the street from Berra when they were young, died six months later on March 23, 2016. Berra's Yankee teammate Don Larsen, who pitched the only perfect game in World Series history and was the only surviving member of the 1956 game at the time of Berra's death, died on January 1, 2020.\n\"Yogi-isms\".\nBerra was known for his impromptu pithy comments, malapropisms, and seemingly unintentional witticisms, known as \"Yogi-isms\". These often took the form of either an apparent tautology or a contradiction, but often with underlying humor and wisdom. Allen Barra has described them as \"distilled bits of wisdom which, like good country songs and old John Wayne movies, get to the truth in a hurry.\"\nExamples.\nBerra is often incorrectly credited with the saying \"It ain't over till the fat lady sings,\" which was first attributed to Texas Tech University sports information director Ralph Carpenter in 1976. When asked about the quotation in 1998, Berra told a \"New York Times\" reporter, \"That's one of the things that I said that I never said.\"\nIn popular culture.\nIn the 1950s, Berra hired Frank Scott as his agent for off-the-field appearances and endorsements. Scott was the first sports agent to focus on an athlete's off-the-field earnings. Berra appeared in advertisements for products and companies including Yoo-Hoo, Visa, Pringles, Stove Top stuffing, Aflac, Camel cigarettes, Ballantine Beer, Kraft Italian salad dressing, Prest-O-Lite batteries, Wheaties, Shelby bicycles, Diamond Chemicals, Spencer Chemicals, AMF Bowling, Miller Lite, Kinney Shoes, Pepsi, Jockey underwear, wristwatches, orange juice, foot spray, and cat food.\nThe cartoon character Yogi Bear first appeared in 1958. The name was similar enough to Berra's name that he considered suing Hanna-Barbera, but Hanna-Barbera claimed that the similarity was just a coincidence. Berra's obituary by the Associated Press initially said that Yogi Bear had died.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was founded in 1991 in Seattle as a non-profit offshoot of the Hudson Institute.\nIts \"Teach the Controversy\" campaign aims to permit the teaching of anti-evolution, intelligent-design propaganda in United States public high school science courses in place of accepted scientific theories, positing that a scientific controversy exists over whether evolution is a reality, when in fact there is none.\nHistory.\nThe institute was cofounded in 1991 by Bruce Chapman and George Gilder as a non-profit educational foundation and think tank.\nIt was started as a branch organization of the Hudson Institute, an Indianapolis-based conservative think tank. It is named after the Royal Navy ship HMS \"Discovery\" in which George Vancouver explored Puget Sound in 1792. The organization was incorporated in 1991.\nDiscovery Institute Press.\nDiscovery Institute Press is the institute's publishing arm and has published intelligent design books by its fellows including David Berlinski's \"Deniable Darwin &amp; Other Essays\" (2010), Jonathan Wells' \"The Myth of Junk DNA\" (2011) and an edited volume titled \"Signature Of Controversy\", which contains apologetics in defense of the institute's Center for Science and Culture director Stephen C. Meyer.\nPhysicians and Surgeons for Scientific Integrity.\nThe Physicians and Surgeons for Scientific Integrity (PSSI), formally registered as PSSI International Inc., is a United States 501(c)(3) nonprofit anti-evolution organization, based in Clearwater, Florida, promoting the pseudoscience of intelligent design associated with the Discovery Institute. While in the past, the organization sponsored events promoting intelligent design and fundamentalist Christianity, it is currently largely inactive. The PSSI was established in early 2006 by Rich Akin. Geoffrey Simmons, Discovery Institute fellow, is one of the directors of the PSSI.\nThe PSSI created a public list of medical professionals who dissent from Darwinism. This list is used by the Discovery Institute in its anti-evolution campaigns. The list is used in support of the Discovery Institute claims that intelligent design is scientifically valid while asserting that evolution lacks broad scientific support.\nThe PSSI, which was active between 2006 and 2008, held a \"Doctors Doubting Darwin\" rally at the University of South Florida's Sun Dome in September 2006. Attendance was estimated at 3,500 to 4,000 people by a local reporter. Apologetic organizations promoting the event had hoped to fill all 7,700 seats in the Sun Dome. This meeting featured the Discovery Institute's Jonathan Wells and fellow Michael Behe, and received local radio coverage. This rally was opposed by the Florida Citizens for Science.\nTeach the Controversy.\nTeach the Controversy is a campaign conducted by the Discovery Institute to promote the pseudoscientific principle of intelligent design, a variant of traditional creationism, while attempting to discredit the teaching of evolution in United States public high school science courses.\nThe scientific community and science education organizations have replied that there is no scientific controversy regarding the validity of evolution and that the controversy is a religious and political one. A federal court, along with the majority of scientific organizations, including the American Association for the Advancement of Science, say the institute has manufactured the controversy they want to teach by promoting a \"false perception\" that evolution is \"a theory in crisis\" by falsely claiming it is the subject of wide controversy and debate within the scientific community. In the December 2005 ruling of \"Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District\", Judge John E. Jones III concluded that intelligent design is not science and \"cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and thus religious, antecedents\".\nWedge strategy.\nThe Wedge Strategy is a political and social action plan authored by the institute. The strategy was put forth in a Discovery Institute manifesto known as the \"Wedge Document\". Its goal is to change American culture by shaping public policy to reflect politically conservative, fundamentalist, evangelical Protestant values. The wedge metaphor is attributed to Phillip E. Johnson and depicts a metal wedge splitting a log. In \"Why Evolution Works (and Creationism Fails)\" the authors wrote \"Although its religious orientation is explicit, the long-term plan outlined in the Wedge Document also displays the Discovery Institute's political agenda very clearly. In ten years, the Wedge strategy was to be extended to ethics, politics, theology; the humanities, and the arts. The ultimate goal of the Discovery Institute is to 'overthrow' materialism and 'renew' American culture to reflect right-wing Christian values.\"\nCenter for Science and Culture.\nThe Center for Science and Culture (CSC), formerly known as the Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture (CRSC), is part of the Discovery Institute, beside other connected sites, such as Mind Matters, operated by the non-profit Walter Bradley Center for Natural and Artificial Intelligence at Discovery Institute. It publishes the blog \"Evolution News &amp; Science Today\" (formerly \"Evolution News &amp; Views\" and often shortened to \"Evolution News\" (EN)), that promotes \"a rigorously God-centered view of creation, including a new 'science' based solidly on theism.\"\nOther issues.\nHomelessness.\nChristopher Rufo, an activist who later opposed the teaching of critical race theory, wrote frequently on the subject of homelessness while he worked for the Discovery Institute. In his 2018 Discovery Institute-funded policy paper \"Seattle Under Siege: How Seattle's Homelessness Policy Perpetuates the Crisis and How We Can Fix It,\" Rufo said that four groups\u2014\"socialist intellectuals\", \"compassion brigades\", the \"homeless-industrial complex\", and the \"addiction evangelists\"\u2014had successfully framed the debate on homelessness and diverted funding to their projects. He described how the \"compassion brigade\" had called for social justice using terms such as \"compassion, empathy, bias, inequality, root causes, systemic racism.\" Rufo brought negative attention to All Home, which at the time was King County, Washington's homelessness agency, by sharing a video of a stripper performing at a conference on homelessness. All Home's director was placed on administrative leave and resigned shortly thereafter.\nCaitlin Bassett of the Discovery Institute has contributed opinion articles that criticize governmental response to homelessness as wasteful and counterproductive to the goal of ending homelessness. The Discovery Institute opposes the Housing First approach, preferring to prioritize treating homeless people for mental illness or drug addiction.\n2020 United States presidential election.\nScott S. Powell, a senior fellow of the Institute, has promoted the false claim that the 2020 United States presidential election was stolen.\nClimate change.\nThe Discovery Institute website has posted articles denying the scientific consensus on climate change.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "43093", "revid": "50739033", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43093", "title": "Flagellum", "text": "Cellular appendage functioning as locomotive or sensory organelle\nA flagellum (; pl.: flagella) (Latin for 'whip' or 'scourge') is a hair-like appendage that protrudes from certain plant and animal sperm cells, from fungal spores (zoospores), and from a wide range of microorganisms to provide motility. Many protists with flagella are known as flagellates.\nA microorganism may have from one to many flagella. A gram-negative bacterium \"Helicobacter pylori\", for example, uses its flagella to propel itself through the stomach to reach the mucous lining where it may colonise the epithelium and potentially cause gastritis, and ulcers \u2013 a risk factor for stomach cancer. In some swarming bacteria, the flagellum can also function as a sensory organelle, being sensitive to wetness outside the cell.\nAcross the three domains of Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryota, the flagellum has a different structure, protein composition, and mechanism of propulsion but shares the same function of providing motility. The Latin word means \"whip\" to describe its lash-like swimming motion. The flagellum in archaea is called the archaellum to note its difference from the bacterial flagellum.\nEukaryotic flagella and cilia are identical in structure but have different lengths and functions. Prokaryotic fimbriae and pili are smaller, and thinner appendages, with different functions. Surface-attached cilia and flagella are used to swim or move fluid from one region to another.\nTypes.\nThe three types of flagella are bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic.\nThe flagella in eukaryotes have dynein and microtubules that move with a bending mechanism. Bacteria and archaea do not have dynein or microtubules in their flagella, and they move using a rotary mechanism.\nOther differences among these three types are:\nBacterial flagella.\nStructure and composition.\nThe bacterial flagellum is made up of protein subunits of flagellin. Its shape is a 20-nanometer-thick hollow tube. It is helical and has a sharp bend just outside the outer membrane; this \"hook\" allows the axis of the helix to point directly away from the cell. A shaft runs between the hook and the basal body, passing through protein rings in the cell's membrane that act as bearings. Gram-positive organisms have two of these basal body rings, one in the peptidoglycan layer and one in the plasma membrane. Gram-negative organisms have four such rings: the L ring associates with the lipopolysaccharides, the P ring associates with peptidoglycan layer, the M ring is embedded in the plasma membrane, and the S ring is directly attached to the cytoplasm. The filament ends with a capping protein.\nThe flagellar filament is the long, helical screw that propels the bacterium when rotated by the motor, through the hook. In most bacteria that have been studied, including the gram-negative \"Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Caulobacter crescentus\", and \"Vibrio alginolyticus\", the filament is made up of 11 protofilaments approximately parallel to the filament axis. Each protofilament is a series of tandem protein chains. However, \"Campylobacter jejuni\" has seven protofilaments.\nThe basal body has several traits in common with some types of secretory pores, such as the hollow, rod-like \"plug\" in their centers extending out through the plasma membrane. The similarities between bacterial flagella and bacterial secretory system structures and proteins provide scientific evidence supporting the theory that bacterial flagella evolved from the type-three secretion system (TTSS).\nThe atomic structure of both bacterial flagella as well as the TTSS injectisome have been elucidated in great detail, especially with the development of cryo-electron microscopy. The best understood parts are the parts between the inner and outer membrane, that is, the scaffolding rings of the inner membrane (IM), the scaffolding pairs of the outer membrane (OM), and the rod/needle (injectisome) or rod/hook (flagellum) sections.\nMotor.\nThe bacterial flagellum is driven by a rotary engine (Mot complex) made up of protein, located at the flagellum's anchor point on the inner cell membrane. The engine is powered by proton-motive force, i.e., by the flow of protons (hydrogen ions) across the bacterial cell membrane due to a concentration gradient set up by the cell's metabolism (\"Vibrio\" species have two kinds of flagella, lateral and polar, and some are driven by a sodium ion pump rather than a proton pump). The rotor transports protons across the membrane, and is turned in the process. The rotor alone can operate at 6,000 to 100,000 rpm, but with the flagellar filament attached usually only reaches 200 to 1000 rpm. The direction of rotation can be changed by the flagellar motor switch almost instantaneously, caused by a slight change in the position of a protein, FliG, in the rotor. The torque is transferred from the MotAB to the torque helix on FliG's D5 domain and with the increase in the requirement of the torque or speed more MotAB are employed. Because the flagellar motor has no on-off switch, the protein epsE is used as a mechanical clutch to disengage the motor from the rotor, thus stopping the flagellum and allowing the bacterium to remain in one place.\nThe production and rotation of a flagellum can take up to 10% of an \"Escherichia coli\" cell's energy budget and has been described as an \"energy-guzzling machine\". Its operation generates reactive oxygen species that elevate mutation rates. \nThe cylindrical shape of flagella is suited to locomotion of microscopic organisms; these organisms operate at a low Reynolds number, where the viscosity of the surrounding water is much more important than its mass or inertia.\nThe rotational speed of flagella varies in response to the intensity of the proton-motive force, thereby permitting certain forms of speed control, and also permitting some types of bacteria to attain remarkable speeds in proportion to their size; some achieve roughly 60 cell lengths per second. At such a speed, a bacterium would take about 245 days to cover 1\u00a0km; although that may seem slow, the perspective changes when the concept of scale is introduced. In comparison to macroscopic life forms, it is very fast indeed when expressed in terms of number of body lengths per second. A cheetah, for example, only achieves about 25 body lengths per second.\nThrough use of their flagella, bacteria are able to move rapidly towards attractants and away from repellents, by means of a biased random walk, with runs and tumbles brought about by rotating its flagellum counterclockwise and clockwise, respectively. The two directions of rotation are not identical (with respect to flagellum movement) and are selected by a molecular switch. Clockwise rotation is called the \"traction mode\" with the body following the flagella. Counterclockwise rotation is called the \"thruster mode\" with the flagella lagging behind the body.\nAssembly.\nDuring flagellar assembly, components of the flagellum pass through the hollow cores of the basal body and the nascent filament. During assembly, protein components are added at the flagellar tip rather than at the base. \"In vitro\", flagellar filaments assemble spontaneously in a solution containing purified flagellin as the sole protein.\nEvolution.\nAt least 10 protein components of the bacterial flagellum share homologous proteins with the type three secretion system (T3SS) found in many gram-negative bacteria, hence one likely evolved from the other. Because the T3SS has a similar number of components as a flagellar apparatus (about 25 proteins), which one evolved first is difficult to determine. However, the flagellar system appears to involve more proteins overall, including various regulators and chaperones, hence it has been argued that flagella evolved from a T3SS. However, it has also been suggested that the flagellum may have evolved first or the two structures evolved in parallel. Early single-cell organisms' need for motility (mobility) support that the more mobile flagella would be selected by evolution first, but the T3SS evolving from the flagellum can be seen as 'reductive evolution', and receives no topological support from the phylogenetic trees. The hypothesis that the two structures evolved separately from a common ancestor accounts for the protein similarities between the two structures, as well as their functional diversity.\nFlagella and the intelligent design debate.\nSome authors have argued that flagella cannot have evolved, assuming that they can only function properly when all proteins are in place. In other words, the flagellar apparatus is \"irreducibly complex\". However, many proteins can be deleted or mutated and the flagellum still works, though sometimes at reduced efficiency. Moreover, with many proteins unique to some number across species, diversity of bacterial flagella composition was higher than expected. Hence, the flagellar apparatus is clearly very flexible in evolutionary terms and perfectly able to lose or gain protein components. For instance, a number of mutations have been found that \"increase\" the motility of \"E. coli\". Additional evidence for the evolution of bacterial flagella includes the existence of vestigial flagella, intermediate forms of flagella and patterns of similarities among flagellar protein sequences, including the observation that almost all of the core flagellar proteins have known homologies with non-flagellar proteins. Furthermore, several processes have been identified as playing important roles in flagellar evolution, including self-assembly of simple repeating subunits, gene duplication with subsequent divergence, recruitment of elements from other systems ('molecular bricolage') and recombination.\nFlagellar arrangements.\nDifferent species of bacteria have different numbers and arrangements of flagella, named using the term \"tricho\", from the Greek \"trichos\" meaning \"hair\".\nSpirochetes, in contrast, have flagella called endoflagella arising from opposite poles of the cell, and are located within the periplasmic space as shown by breaking the outer-membrane and also by electron cryotomography microscopy. The rotation of the filaments relative to the cell body causes the entire bacterium to move forward in a corkscrew-like motion, even through material viscous enough to prevent the passage of normally flagellated bacteria.\nIn certain large forms of \"Selenomonas\", more than 30 individual flagella are organized outside the cell body, helically twining about each other to form a thick structure (easily visible with the light microscope) called a \"fascicle\".\nIn some \"Vibrio\" spp. (particularly \"Vibrio parahaemolyticus\") and related bacteria such as \"Aeromonas\", two flagellar systems co-exist, using different sets of genes and different ion gradients for energy. The polar flagella are constitutively expressed and provide motility in bulk fluid, while the lateral flagella are expressed when the polar flagella meet too much resistance to turn. These provide swarming motility on surfaces or in viscous fluids.\nBundling.\nBundling is a phenomenon in multi-flagellated cells where flagella cluster together and rotate in a synchronized manner to facilitate movement. These flagella, characterized by their left-handed helical structure, align and spin as a unit when their molecular rotors turn counterclockwise, driving the cell forward through its environment. When the rotors reverse to a clockwise direction, the flagella unravel from the bundle, disrupting their coordinated motion. This unraveling triggers a behavior known as tumbling, where the cell ceases its forward trajectory and instead twitches or jiggles in place. Tumbling results in a random reorientation of the cell, effectively changing the direction of its subsequent forward swimming. This process is critical for bacteria like Escherichia coli, enabling them to navigate complex environments by alternating between directed swimming and random reorientation. The mechanism of bundling and tumbling highlights the intricate motility strategies of microorganisms, allowing them to respond to environmental stimuli. This behavior is well-studied in bacterial chemotaxis, where cells adjust their path toward favorable conditions.\nIt is not known which stimuli drive the switch between bundling and tumbling, but the motor is highly adaptive to different signals. In the model describing chemotaxis (\"movement on purpose\") the clockwise rotation of a flagellum is suppressed by chemical compounds favorable to the cell (e.g. food). When moving in a favorable direction, the concentration of such chemical attractants increases and therefore tumbles are continually suppressed, allowing forward motion; likewise, when the cell's direction of motion is unfavorable (e.g., away from a chemical attractant), tumbles are no longer suppressed and occur much more often, with the chance that the cell will be thus reoriented in the correct direction.\nEven if all flagella would rotate clockwise, however, they often cannot form a bundle due to geometrical and hydrodynamic reasons.\nEukaryotic flagella.\nTerminology.\nAiming to emphasize the distinction between the bacterial flagella and the eukaryotic cilia and flagella, some authors attempted to replace the name of these two eukaryotic structures with \"undulipodia\" (e.g., all papers by Margulis since the 1970s) or \"cilia\" for both (e.g., H\u00fclsmann, 1992; Adl et al., 2012; most papers of Cavalier-Smith), preserving \"flagella\" for the bacterial structure. However, the discriminative usage of the terms \"cilia\" and \"flagella\" for eukaryotes adopted in this article (see below) is still common (e.g., Andersen et al., 1991; Leadbeater et al., 2000).\nInternal structure.\nThe core of a eukaryotic flagellum, known as the axoneme is a bundle of nine fused pairs of microtubules known as \"doublets\" surrounding two central single microtubules (\"singlets\"). This 9+2 axoneme is characteristic of the eukaryotic flagellum. At the base of a eukaryotic flagellum is a basal body, \"blepharoplast\" or kinetosome, which is the microtubule organizing center for flagellar microtubules and is about 500 nanometers long. Basal bodies are structurally identical to centrioles. The flagellum is encased within the cell's plasma membrane, so that the interior of the flagellum is accessible to the cell's cytoplasm.\nBesides the axoneme and basal body, relatively constant in morphology, other internal structures of the flagellar apparatus are the transition zone (where the axoneme and basal body meet) and the root system (microtubular or fibrillar structures that extend from the basal bodies into the cytoplasm), more variable and useful as indicators of phylogenetic relationships of eukaryotes. Other structures, more uncommon, are the paraflagellar (or paraxial, paraxonemal) rod, the R fiber, and the S fiber. For surface structures, see below.\nMechanism.\nEach of the outer 9 doublet microtubules extends a pair of dynein arms (an \"inner\" and an \"outer\" arm) to the adjacent microtubule; these produce force through ATP hydrolysis. The flagellar axoneme also contains radial spokes, polypeptide complexes extending from each of the outer nine microtubule doublets towards the central pair, with the \"head\" of the spoke facing inwards. The radial spoke is thought to be involved in the regulation of flagellar motion, although its exact function and method of action are not yet understood.\nFlagella versus cilia.\nThe regular beat patterns of eukaryotic cilia and flagella generate motion on a cellular level. Examples range from the propulsion of single cells such as the swimming of spermatozoa to the transport of fluid along a stationary layer of cells such as in the respiratory tract.\nAlthough eukaryotic cilia and flagella are ultimately the same, they are sometimes classed by their pattern of movement, a tradition from before their structures have been known. In the case of flagella, the motion is often planar and wave-like, whereas the motile cilia often perform a more complicated three-dimensional motion with a power and recovery stroke. Yet another traditional form of distinction is by the number of 9+2 organelles on the cell.\nIntraflagellar transport.\nIntraflagellar transport, the process by which axonemal subunits, transmembrane receptors, and other proteins are moved up and down the length of the flagellum, is essential for proper functioning of the flagellum, in both motility and signal transduction.\nEvolution and occurrence.\nEukaryotic flagella or cilia, probably an ancestral characteristic, are widespread in almost all groups of eukaryotes, as a relatively perennial condition, or as a flagellated life cycle stage (e.g., zoids, gametes, zoospores, which may be produced continually or not).\nThe first situation is found either in specialized cells of multicellular organisms (e.g., the choanocytes of sponges, or the ciliated epithelia of metazoans), as in ciliates and many eukaryotes with a \"flagellate condition\" (or \"monadoid \", see , an artificial group).\nFlagellated lifecycle stages are found in many groups, e.g., many green algae (zoospores and male gametes), bryophytes (male gametes), pteridophytes (male gametes), some gymnosperms (cycads and \"Ginkgo\", as male gametes), centric diatoms (male gametes), brown algae (zoospores and gametes), oomycetes (asexual zoospores and gametes), hyphochytrids (zoospores), labyrinthulomycetes (zoospores), some apicomplexans (gametes), some radiolarians (probably gametes), foraminiferans (gametes), plasmodiophoromycetes (zoospores and gametes), myxogastrids (zoospores), metazoans (male gametes), and chytrid fungi (zoospores and gametes).\nFlagella or cilia are completely absent in some groups, probably due to a loss rather than being a primitive condition. The loss of cilia occurred in red algae, some green algae (Zygnematophyceae), the gymnosperms except cycads and \"Ginkgo\", angiosperms, pennate diatoms, some apicomplexans, some amoebozoans, in the sperm of some metazoans, and in fungi (except chytrids).\nTypology.\nA number of terms related to flagella or cilia are used to characterize eukaryotes. According to surface structures present, flagella may be:\nAccording to the number of flagella, cells may be: (remembering that some authors use \"ciliated\" instead of \"flagellated\")\nAccording to the place of insertion of the flagella:\nAccording to the beating pattern:\nOther terms related to the flagellar type:\nArchaeal flagella.\nThe archaellum possessed by some species of Archaea is superficially similar to the bacterial flagellum; in the 1980s, they were thought to be homologous on the basis of gross morphology and behavior. Both flagella and archaella consist of filaments extending outside the cell, and rotate to propel the cell. Archaeal flagella have a unique structure which lacks a central channel. Similar to bacterial type IV pilins, the archaeal proteins (archaellins) are made with class 3 signal peptides and they are processed by a type IV prepilin peptidase-like enzyme. The archaellins are typically modified by the addition of N-linked glycans which are necessary for proper assembly or function.\nDiscoveries in the 1990s revealed numerous detailed differences between the archaeal and bacterial flagella. These include:\nThese differences support the theory that the bacterial flagella and archaella are a classic case of biological analogy, or convergent evolution, rather than homology. Research into the structure of archaella made significant progress beginning in the early 2010s, with the first atomic resolution structure of an archaella protein, the discovery of additional functions of archaella, and the first reports of archaella in Nanoarchaeota and Thaumarchaeota.\nFungal.\nThe only fungi to have a single flagellum on their spores are the chytrids. In \"Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis\" the flagellum is 19\u201320\u00a0\u03bcm long. A nonfunctioning centriole lies adjacent to the kinetosome. Nine interconnected props attach the kinetosome to the plasmalemma, and a terminal plate is present in the transitional zone. An inner ring-like structure attached to the tubules of the flagellar doublets within the transitional zone has been observed in transverse section.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In addition, gender roles (and perceived gender roles) vary based on a person's race or ethnicity.\nGender roles influence a wide range of human behavior, often including the clothing a person chooses to wear, the profession a person pursues, manner of approach to things, the personal relationships a person enters, and how they behave within those relationships. Although gender roles have evolved and expanded, they traditionally keep women in the \"private\" sphere, and men in the \"public\" sphere.\nVarious groups, most notably feminist movements, have led efforts to change aspects of prevailing gender roles that they believe are oppressive, inaccurate, and sexist.\nBackground.\nA gender role, also known as a sex role, is a social role encompassing a range of behaviors and attitudes that are generally considered acceptable, appropriate, or desirable for a person based on that person's sex. Gender roles can be linked with essentialism, the idea that humans have a set of attributes that are necessary to their identity based on their gender. Sociologists tend to use the term \"gender role\" instead of \"sex role\", because the sociocultural understanding of gender is distinguished from biological conceptions of sex.\nIn the sociology of gender, the process whereby an individual learns and acquires a gender role in society is termed \"gender socialization\".\nGender roles are culturally specific, and while most cultures distinguish only two (boy/man and girl/woman), others recognize more. Some non-Western societies have three genders: men, women, and a third gender. Buginese society has identified five genders. Androgyny has sometimes also been proposed as a third gender. An androgyne or androgynous person is someone with qualities pertaining to both the male and female gender. Some individuals identify with no gender at all.\nMany transgender people identify simply as men or women, and do not constitute a separate third gender. Biological differences between (some) trans women and cisgender women have historically been treated as relevant in certain contexts, especially those where biological traits may yield an unfair advantage, such as sport.\n\"Gender role\" is not the same thing as \"gender identity\", which refers to the internal sense of one's own gender, whether or not it aligns with categories offered by societal norms. The point at which these internalized gender identities become externalized into a set of expectations is the genesis of a gender role.\nTheories.\nSex differences in psychology can be explained by various theories, see possible causes. According to the theory of social constructionism, gendered behavior is mostly due to the social construction of gender. Other theories such as evolutionary psychology disagree with that position.\nMost children learn to categorize themselves by gender by the age of three. From birth, in the course of gender socialization, children learn gender stereotypes and roles from their parents and environment. Traditionally, boys learn to manipulate their physical and social environment through physical strength or dexterity, while girls learn to present themselves as objects to be viewed. Social constructionists argue that differences between male and female behavior are better attributable to gender-segregated children's activities than to any essential, natural, physiological, or genetic predisposition.\nAs an aspect of role theory, gender role theory \"treats these differing distributions of women and men into roles as the primary origin of sex-differentiated social behavior, [and posits that] their impact on behavior is mediated by psychological and social processes.\" According to Gilbert Herdt, gender roles arose from correspondent inference, meaning that general labor division was extended to gender roles.\nSocial constructionists consider gender roles to be hierarchical and patriarchal. The term patriarchy, according to researcher Andrew Cherlin, defines \"a social order based on the domination of women by men, especially in agricultural societies\".\nAccording to Eagly et al., the consequences of gender roles and stereotypes are sex-typed social behavior because roles and stereotypes are both socially-shared descriptive norms and prescriptive norms.\nConflicts between aspects of gender roles result in gender role conflicts.\nMajor theorists.\nTalcott Parsons.\nWorking in the United States in 1955, Talcott Parsons developed a model of the nuclear family, which at that place and time was the prevalent family structure. The model compared a traditional contemporaneous view of gender roles with a more liberal view. The Parsons model was used to contrast and illustrate extreme positions on gender roles, i.e., gender roles described in the sense of Max Weber's ideal types (an exaggerated and simplified version of a phenomenon, used for analytical purposes) rather than how they appear in reality. Model A described a total separation of male and female roles, while Model B described the complete dissolution of gender roles.\nThe model is consciously a simplification; individuals' actual behavior usually lies somewhere between these poles. According to the interactionist approach, gender roles are not fixed but are constantly renegotiated between individuals.\nJohn Money.\n\"In the 1950s, John Money and his colleagues took up the study of intersex individuals, who, Money realized, 'would provide invaluable material for the comparative study for bodily form and physiology, rearing, and psychosexual orientation'.\" Money coined the term \"gender role,\" which he defined in a seminal 1955 paper as \"all those things that a person says or does to disclose himself or herself as having the status of boy or man, girl or woman.\"\nThe team concluded that gonads, hormones, and chromosomes did not automatically determine a child's gender role.\nWest and Zimmerman.\nCandace West and Don H. Zimmerman developed an interactionist perspective on gender beyond its construction of \"roles.\" For them, gender is \"the product of social doings of some sort undertaken by men and women whose competence as members of society is hostage to its production.\" This approach is described by Elisabeth K. Kelan as an \"ethnomethodological approach\" which analyzes \"micro interactions to reveal how the objective and given nature of the world is accomplished,\" suggesting that gender does not exist until it is empirically perceived and performed through interactions. West and Zimmerman argued that the use of \"role\" to describe gender expectations conceals the production of gender through everyday activities. Furthermore, they stated that roles are situated identities, such as \"nurse\" and \"student,\" which are developed as the situation demands, while gender is a master identity with no specific site or organizational context. For them, \"conceptualizing gender as a role makes it difficult to assess its influence on other roles and reduces its explanatory usefulness in discussions of power and inequality.\" West and Zimmerman consider gender an individual production that reflects and constructs interactional and institutional gender expectations.\nJudith Butler.\nJudith Butler wrote \"Gender Trouble\" and \"Undoing Gender.\" She claims that people feel pressure to adhere to gender norms, and the actions gender roles dictate. Because gender roles are so engrained in our society, it is difficult to overcome them. Gender becomes concrete through our actions that reinforce gender. Butler calls this \"reiteration\", where we do certain activities that reinforce our gender. Then, through the process of \"materialization\", these gender roles and norms shape the way we move throughout the world. Butler poses that gender is something we \"do\" through gender roles. Therefore, gender can be \"undone,\" and gender is not a natural occurrence. Societies uphold gender through \"functional sex roles\", or gender roles. However, the structures that uphold gender can change over time. \nDepartures from the norm show that gender roles are not enforced by anything other than their repeated use and enforcement. Therefore, gender roles are not real, but are constructed by humans in society. When realizing that gender and sex as the basis for these roles are not stable, it is easy to see how the roles themselves are not stable either. Gender and sex are more diverse than the gender binary and the sex binary, so gender roles could also be diverse.\nBiological factors.\nHistorically, gender roles have been largely attributed to biological differences in men and women. Although research indicates that biology plays a role in gendered behavior, the extent of its effects on gender roles is less clear.\nOne hypothesis attributes differences in gender roles to evolution. The sociobiological view argues that men's fitness is increased by being aggressive, allowing them to compete with other men for access to females, as well as by being sexually promiscuous and trying to father as many children as possible. Women are benefited by bonding with infants and caring for children. Sociobiologists argue that these roles are evolutionary and led to the establishment of traditional gender roles, with women in the domestic sphere and men dominant in every other area. However, this view pre-assumes a view of nature that is contradicted by the fact that women engage in hunting in 79% of modern hunter-gatherer societies. However, an attempted verification of this study found \"that multiple methodological failures all bias their results in the same direction...their analysis does not contradict the wide body of empirical evidence for gendered divisions of labor in foraging societies\".\nAnother hypothesis attributes differences in gender roles to prenatal exposure to hormones. Early research examining the effect of biology on gender roles by John Money and Anke Ehrhardt primarily focused on girls with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), resulting in higher-than-normal prenatal exposure to androgens. Their research found that girls with CAH exhibited tomboy-like behavior, were less interested in dolls, and were less likely to make-believe as parents. A number of methodological problems with the studies have been identified. A study on 1950s American teenage girls who had been exposed to androgenic steroids by their mothers \"in utero\" exhibited more traditionally masculine behavior, such as being more concerned about their future career than marriage, wearing pants, and not being interested in jewelry.\nSociologist Linda L. Lindsey critiqued the notion that gender roles are a result of prenatal hormone exposure, saying that while hormones may explain sex differences like sexual orientation and gender identity, they \"cannot account for gender differences in other roles such as nurturing, love, and criminal behavior\". By contrast, some research indicates that both neurobiological and social risk factors can interact in a way that predisposes one to engaging in criminal behavior (including juvenile delinquency).\nWith regard to gender stereotypes, the societal roles and differences in power between men and women are much more strongly indicated than is a biological component.\nIn culture.\nIdeas of appropriate gendered behavior vary among cultures and era, although some aspects receive more widespread attention than others. In the \"World Values Survey\", responders were asked if they thought that wage work should be restricted to only men in the case of shortage in jobs: in Iceland the proportion that agreed with the proposition was 3.6%; while in Egypt it was 94.9%.\nAttitudes have also varied historically. For example, in Europe, during the Middle Ages, women were commonly associated with roles related to medicine and healing. Because of the rise of witch-hunts across Europe and the institutionalization of medicine, these roles became exclusively associated with men. In the last few decades, these roles have become largely gender-neutral in Western society.\nVern Bullough stated that homosexual communities are generally more tolerant of switching gender roles. For instance, someone with a masculine voice, a five o'clock shadow (or a fuller beard), an Adam's apple, wearing a woman's dress and high heels, carrying a purse would most likely draw ridicule or other unfriendly attention in ordinary social contexts.\nBecause the dominant class sees this form of gender expression as unacceptable, inappropriate, or perhaps threatening, these individuals are significantly more likely to experience discrimination and harassment both in their personal lives and from their employers, according to a 2011 report from the Center for American Progress.\nGender roles may be a means through which one expresses one's gender identity, but they may also be employed as a means of exerting social control, and individuals may experience negative social consequences for violating them.\nGender stereotypes.\nA 1992 study tested gender stereotypes and labeling within young children in the United States. Fagot \"et al.\" divided this into two different studies; the first investigated how children identified the differences between gender labels of boys and girls, the second study looked at both gender labeling and stereotyping in the relationship of mother and child.\nWithin the first study, 23 children between the ages of two and seven underwent a series of gender labeling and gender stereotyping tests: the children viewed either pictures of males and females or objects such as a hammer or a broom, then identified or labeled those to a certain gender. The results of these tests showed that children under three years could make gender-stereotypic associations.\nThe second study looked at gender labeling and stereotyping in the relationship of mother and child using three separate methods. The first consisted of identifying gender labeling and stereotyping, essentially the same method as the first study. The second consisted of behavioral observations, which looked at ten-minute play sessions with mother and child using gender-specific toys.\nThe third study used a series of questionnaires such as an \"Attitude Toward Women Scale\", \"Personal Attributes Questionnaire\", and \"Schaefer and Edgerton Scale\" which looked at the family values of the mother.\nThe results of these studies showed the same as the first study with regards to labeling and stereotyping.\nThey also identified in the second method that the mothers' positive reactions and responses to same-sex or opposite-sex toys played a role in how children identified them. Within the third method the results found that the mothers of the children who passed the \"Gender Labeling Test\" had more traditional family values. These two studies, conducted by Beverly I. Fagot, Mar D. Leinbach and Cherie O'Boyle, showed that gender stereotyping and labeling is acquired at a very young age, and that social interactions and associations play a large role in how genders are identified.\nVirginia Woolf, in the 1920s, made the point: \"It is obvious that the values of women differ very often from the values which have been made by the other sex. Yet it is the masculine values that prevail\", remade sixty years later by psychologist Carol Gilligan who used it to show that psychological tests of maturity have generally been based on masculine parameters, and so tended to show that women were less 'mature'. Gilligan countered this in her ground-breaking work, \"In a Different Voice\", holding that maturity in women is shown in terms of different, but equally important, human values.\nGender stereotypes are extremely common in society. One of the reasons this may be is simply because it is easier on the brain to stereotype (see Heuristics).\nThe brain has limited perceptual and memory systems, so it categorizes information into fewer and simpler units which allows for more efficient information processing. Gender stereotypes appear to have an effect at an early age. In one study, the effects of gender stereotypes on children's mathematical abilities were tested. In this study of American children between the ages of six and ten, it was found that the children, as early as the second grade, demonstrated the gender stereotype that mathematics is a 'boy's subject'. This may show that the mathematical self-belief is influenced before the age in which there are discernible differences in mathematical achievement.\nAccording to the 1972 study by Jean Lipman-Blumen, women who grew up following traditional gender-roles from childhood were less likely to want to be highly educated while women brought up with the view that men and women are equal were more likely to want higher education. This result indicates that gender roles that have been passed down traditionally can influence stereotypes about gender.\nIn a later study, Deaux and her colleagues (1984) found that most people think women are \"more\" \"nurturant\", but \"less self-assertive\" than men, and that this belief is indicated universally, but that this awareness is related to women's \"role\". To put it another way, women do not have an \"inherently\" nurturant personality, rather that a nurturing personality is acquired by whoever happens to be doing the housework.\nA study of gender stereotypes by Jacobs (1991) found that parents' stereotypes interact with the sex of their child to directly influence the parents' beliefs about the child's abilities. In turn, parents' beliefs about their child directly influence their child's self-perceptions, and both the parents' stereotypes and the child's self-perceptions influence the child's performance.\nStereotype threat involves the risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group. In the case of gender it is the implicit belief in gender stereotype that women perform worse than men in mathematics, which is proposed to lead to lower performance by women.\nA review article of stereotype threat research (2012) relating to the relationship between gender and mathematical abilities concluded \"that although stereotype threat may affect some women, the existing state of knowledge does not support the current level of enthusiasm for this [as a] mechanism underlying the gender gap in mathematics\".\nIn 2018, Jolien A. van Breen and colleagues conducted research into subliminal gender stereotyping. Researchers took participants through a fictional \"Moral Choice Dilemma Task\", which presented eight scenarios \"in which sacrificing one person can save several others of unspecified gender. In four scenarios, participants are asked to sacrifice a man to save several others (of unspecified gender), and in four other scenarios they are asked to sacrifice a woman.\" The results showed that women who identified as feminists were more willing to 'sacrifice' men than women who did not identify as feminists. \"If a person wanted to counteract that and 'level the playing field', that can be done either by boosting women or by downgrading men\", said van Breen. \"So I think that this effect on evaluations of men arises because our participants are trying to achieve an underlying aim: counteracting gender stereotypes.\"\nAccording to Professor Lei Chang, gender attitudes within the domains of work and domestic roles, can be measured using a cross-cultural gender role attitudes test. Psychological processes of the East have historically been analysed using Western models (or \"instruments\") that have been translated, which potentially, is a more far-reaching process than linguistic translation. Some North American instruments for assessing gender role attitudes include:\nThrough such tests, it is known that American southerners exhibit less egalitarian gender views than their northern counterparts, demonstrating that gender views are inevitably affected by an individual's culture. This also may differ among compatriots whose 'cultures' are a few hundred miles apart.\nA study by Richard Bagozzi, Nancy Wong and Youjae Yi, examines the interaction between culture and gender that produces distinct patterns of association between positive and negative emotions. The United States was considered a more 'independence-based culture', while China was considered 'interdependence-based'. In the US people tend to experience emotions in terms of opposition whereas in China, they do so in dialectical terms (i.e., those of logical argumentation and contradictory forces). The study continued with sets of psychological tests among university students in Beijing and in Michigan. The fundamental goals of the research were to show that \"gender differences in emotions are adaptive for the differing roles that males and females play in the culture\". The evidence for differences in gender role was found during the socialization in work experiment, proving that \"women are socialized to be more expressive of their feelings and to show this to a greater extent in facial expressions and gestures, as well as by verbal means\". The study extended to the biological characteristics of both gender groups \u2014 for a higher association between PA and NA hormones in memory for women, the cultural patterns became more evident for women than for men.\nImplicit gender stereotypes.\nGender stereotypes and roles can also be supported implicitly. Implicit stereotypes are the unconscious influence of attitudes a person may or may not even be aware that he or she holds. Gender stereotypes can also be held in this manner.\nThese implicit stereotypes can often be demonstrated by the Implicit-association test (IAT).\nOne example of an implicit gender stereotype is that males are seen as better at mathematics than females. It has been found that men have stronger positive associations with mathematics than women, while women have stronger negative associations with mathematics and the more strongly a woman associates herself with the female gender identity, the more negative her association with mathematics.\nThese associations have been disputed for their biological connection to gender and have been attributed to social forces that perpetuate stereotypes such as aforementioned stereotype that men are better at mathematics than women.\nThis particular stereotype has been found in American children as early as second grade.\nThe same test found that the strength of a Singaporean child's mathematics-gender stereotype and gender identity predicted the child's association between individuals and mathematical ability.\nIt has been shown that this stereotype also reflects mathematical performance: a study was done on the worldwide scale and it was found that the strength of this mathematics-gender stereotype in varying countries correlates with 8th graders' scores on the TIMSS, a standardized math and science achievement test that is given worldwide. The results were controlled for general gender inequality and yet were still significant.\nChanging roles.\nThroughout history spouses have been charged with certain societal functions. With the rise of the New World came the expected roles that each spouse was to carry out specifically. Husbands were typically working farmers - the providers. Wives were caregivers for children and the home. However, the roles are now changing, and even reversing.\nSocieties can change such that the gender roles rapidly change. The 21st century has seen a shift in gender roles due to multiple factors such as new family structures, education, media, and several others. A 2003 survey by the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicated that about 1/3 of wives may earn more than their husbands.\nWith the importance of education emphasized nationwide, and the access of college degrees (online, for example), women have begun furthering their educations. Women have also started to get more involved in recreation activities such as sports, which in the past were regarded to be for men. Family dynamic structures are changing, and the number of single-mother or single-father households is increasing. Fathers are also becoming more involved with raising their children, instead of the responsibility resting solely with the mother.\nRalph H. Turner claims as more women work, we expect gender roles to be more evenly distributed between husband and wife. While that is true to some extent, as men may take on more roles within the house and women contribute more financially, there are few large scale changes. Gender roles are so ingrained in our society that it is difficult to break out of them and change our overall societal norms. As long as gender roles exist, they will continue to be enforced. Thus, changing our practices can change gender norms. As we continue to see certain gender roles as archaic, we will stop regulating gender norms and will displace gender roles.\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, the number of stay-at-home fathers in the US nearly doubled in the period from 1989 to 2012, from 1.1 million to 2.0 million. This trend appears to be mirrored in a number of countries including the UK, Canada and Sweden. However, Pew also found that, at least in the US, public opinion in general appears to show a substantial bias toward favoring a mother as a care-taker versus a father, regardless of any shift in actual roles each plays.\nGender equality allows gender roles to become less distinct and according to Donnalyn Pompper, is the reason \"men no longer own breadwinning identities and, like women, their bodies are objectified in mass media images.\" The LGBTQ rights movement has played a role increasing pro-gay attitudes, which according to Brian McNair, are expressed by many metrosexual men.\nBesides North America and Europe, there are other regions whose gender roles are also changing. In Asia, Hong Kong is very close to the USA because the female surgeons in these societies are focused heavily on home life, whereas Japan is focused more on work life. After a female surgeon gives birth in Hong Kong, she wants to cut her work schedule down, but keeps working full time (60\u201380 hours per week). Similar to Hong Kong, Japanese surgeons still work long hours, but they try to rearrange their schedules so they can be at home more (end up working less than 60 hours). Although all three places have women working advanced jobs, the female surgeons in the US and Hong Kong feel more gender equality at home where they have equal, if not more control of their families, and Japanese surgeons feel the men are still in control.\nA big change was seen in Hong Kong because the wives used to deal with unhappy marriage. Now, Chinese wives have been divorcing their husbands when they feel unhappy with their marriages, and are stable financially. This makes the wife seem more in control of her own life, instead of letting her husband control her. Other places, such as Singapore and Taipei are also seeing changes in gender roles. In many societies, but especially Singapore and Taipei, women have more jobs that have a leadership position (i.e. A doctor or manager), and fewer jobs as a regular worker (i.e. A clerk or salesperson). The males in Singapore also have more leadership roles, but they have more lower level jobs too. In the past, the women would get the lower level jobs, and the men would get all the leadership positions. There is an increase of male unemployment in Singapore, Taipei, and Hong Kong, so the women are having to work more in order to support their families. In the past, the males were usually the ones supporting the family.\nIn India, the women are married young, and are expected to run the household, even if they did not finish school. It is seen as shameful if a woman has to work outside of the house in order to help support the family. Many women are starting jewelry businesses inside their houses and have their own bank accounts because of it. Middle aged women are now able to work without being shameful because they are no longer childbearing.\nIn sexual relationships.\nCommunication of sexual desire.\nMetts, et al. explain that sexual desire is linked to emotions and communicative expression. Communication is central in expressing sexual desire and \"complicated emotional states\", and is also the \"mechanism for negotiating the relationship implications of sexual activity and emotional meanings\". Gender differences appear to exist in communicating sexual desire, for example, masculine people are generally perceived to be more interested in sex than feminine people, and research suggests that masculine people are more likely than feminine people to express sexual interest.\nThis may be greatly affected by masculine people being less inhibited by social norms for expressing their desire, being more aware of their sexual desire or succumbing to the expectations of their cultures. When feminine people employ tactics to show their sexual desire, they are typically more indirect in nature. On the other hand, it is known masculinity is associated with aggressive behavior in almost all mammals, and most likely explains at least part of the fact that masculine people are more likely to express their sexual interest. This is known as the Challenge hypothesis.\nVarious studies show different communication strategies with a feminine person refusing a masculine person's sexual interest. Some research, like that of Murnen, show that when feminine people offer refusals, the refusals are verbal and typically direct. When masculine people do not comply with this refusal, feminine people offer stronger and more direct refusals. However, research from Perper and Weis showed that rejection includes acts of avoidance, creating distractions, making excuses, departure, hinting, arguments to delay, etc. These differences in refusal communication techniques are just one example of the importance of communicative competence for both masculine and feminine gender cultures.\nIn marriage.\nThe institution of marriage influences gender roles, inequality, and change. In the United States, gender roles are communicated by the media, social interaction, and language. Through these platforms society has influenced individuals to fulfill from a young age the stereotypical gender roles in a heterosexual marriage. Roles traditionally distributed according to biological sex are increasingly negotiated by spouses on an equal footing.\nIn the U.S., marriage roles are generally decided based on gender. For approximately the past seven decades, heterosexual marriage roles have been defined for men and women based on society's expectations and the influence of the media. Men and women are typically associated with certain social roles, dependent upon the personality traits associated with those roles. Traditionally, the role of the homemaker is associated with a woman and the role of a breadwinner is associated with a male.\nIn the U.S., single men are outnumbered by single women at a ratio of 100 single women to 86 single men, though never-married men over the age of 15 outnumber women by a 5:4 ratio (33.9% to 27.3%) according to the 2006 U.S. Census American Community Survey. The results are varied between age groups, with 118 single men per 100 single women in their 20s, versus 33 single men to 100 single women over 65.\nThe numbers also vary between countries. For example, China has many more young men than young women, and this disparity is expected to increase. In regions with recent conflict, such as Chechnya, women greatly outnumber men.\nIn a cross-cultural study by David Buss, men and women were asked to rank the importance of certain traits in a long-term partner. Both men and women ranked \"kindness\" and \"intelligence\" as the two most important factors. Men valued beauty and youth more highly than women, while women valued financial and social status more highly than men.\nGendered roles in heterosexual marriages are learned through imitation. People learn what society views as appropriate gender behaviors from imitating the repetition of actions by one's role-model or parent of the same biological sex. Imitation in the physical world that impacts one's gendered roles often comes from role-modeling parents, peers, teachers, and other significant figures in one's life. In a marriage, oftentimes each person's gendered roles are determined by his or her parents. If the wife grew up imitating the actions of traditional parents, and the husband non-traditional parents, their views on marital roles would be different. One way people can acquire these stereotypical roles through a reward and punishment system. When a little girl imitates her mother by performing the traditional domestic duties she is often rewarded by being told she is doing a good job. Nontraditionally, if a little boy was performing the same tasks he would more likely be punished due to acting feminine. Because society holds these expected roles for men and women within a marriage, it creates a mold for children to follow.\nChanging gender roles in marriage.\nOver the years, gender roles have continued to change and have a significant impact on the institution of marriage. Traditionally, men and women had completely opposing roles, men were seen as the provider for the family and women were seen as the caretakers of both the home and the family. However, in today's society the division of roles is starting to blur. More and more individuals are adapting non-traditional gender roles into their marriages in order to share responsibilities. This view on gender roles seeks out equality between sexes. In today's society, it is more likely that a husband and wife are both providers for their family. More and more women are entering the workforce while more men are contributing to household duties.\nAfter around the year 1980, divorce rates in the United States stabilized. Scholars in the area of sociology explain that this stabilization was due to several factors including, but not limited to, the shift in gender roles. The attitude concerning the shift in gender roles can be classified into two perspectives: traditional and egalitarian. Traditional attitudes uphold designated responsibilities for the sexes \u2013 wives raise the children and keep the home nice, and husbands are the breadwinners. Egalitarian attitudes uphold responsibilities being carried out equally by both sexes \u2013 wives and husbands are both breadwinners and they both take part in raising the children and keeping the home nice. Over the past 40 years, attitudes in marriages have become more egalitarian. Two studies carried out in the early 2000s have shown strong correlation between egalitarian attitudes and happiness and satisfaction in marriage, which scholars believe lead to stabilization in divorce rates. The results of a 2006 study performed by Gayle Kaufman, a professor of sociology, indicated that those who hold egalitarian attitudes report significantly higher levels of marital happiness than those with more traditional attitudes. Another study executed by Will Marshall in 2008 had results showing that relationships with better quality involve people with more egalitarian beliefs. It has been assumed by Danielle J. Lindemann, a sociologist who studies gender, sexuality, the family, and culture, that the shift in gender roles and egalitarian attitudes have resulted in marriage stability due to tasks being carried out by both partners, such as working late-nights and picking up ill children from school. Although the gap in gender roles still exists, roles have become less gendered and more equal in marriages compared to how they were traditionally.\nSexual orientation.\nSexual orientation is defined by the interplay between a person's emotional and physical attraction toward others. Generally, sexual orientation is broken into the three categories: heterosexual, homosexual and bisexual. By basic definition, the term heterosexual is typically used in reference to someone who is attracted to people of the opposite sex, the term homosexual is used to classify people who are attracted to those of the same sex, and the term bisexual is used to identify those who are attracted to both the same and opposite sexes. Sexual orientation can be variously defined based on sexual identity, sexual behavior and sexual attraction. People can fall anywhere on a spectrum from strictly heterosexual to strictly homosexual.\nScientists do not know the exact cause of sexual orientation, but they theorize that it is caused by a complex interplay of genetic, hormonal, and environmental influences, and do not view it as a choice. Although no single theory on the cause of sexual orientation has yet gained widespread support, scientists favor biologically based theories. There is considerably more evidence supporting nonsocial, biological causes of sexual orientation than social ones, especially for males. There is no substantive evidence which suggests parenting or early childhood experiences play a role with regard to sexual orientation.\nAn active conflict over the cultural acceptability of non-heterosexuality rages worldwide. The belief or assumption that heterosexual relationships and acts are \"normal\" is described as heterosexism or in queer theory, heteronormativity. Gender identity and sexual orientation are two separate aspects of individual identity, although they are often mistaken in the media.\nPerhaps it is an attempt to reconcile this conflict that leads to a common assumption that one same-sex partner assumes a pseudo-male gender role and the other assumes a pseudo-female role. For a gay male relationship, this might lead to the assumption that the \"wife\" handled domestic chores, was the receptive sexual partner, adopted effeminate mannerisms, and perhaps even dressed in women's clothing. This assumption is flawed because homosexual couples tend to have more equal roles, and the effeminate behavior of some gay men is usually not adopted consciously, but is often more subtle.\nCohabitating same-sex partners are typically egalitarian when they assign domestic chores. Sometimes these couples assign traditional female responsibilities to one partner and traditional male responsibilities to the other. Same-sex domestic partners challenge traditional gender roles in their division of household responsibilities, and gender roles within homosexual relationships are flexible. For instance, cleaning and cooking, traditionally regarded by many as female responsibilities, might be assigned to different people. Masculine women may take on traditionally male and female roles within the house, depending on their family's needs. Carrington observed the daily home lives of 52 gay and lesbian couples and found that the length of the work week and level of earning power substantially affected the assignment of housework, regardless of gender or sexuality.\nIn many cultures, gender roles, especially for men, simultaneously act as an indicator for heterosexuality, and as a boundary of acceptable behavior for straight people. Therefore, lesbians, gay men and bisexual people may be viewed as exempt from some or all components of gender roles or as having different \"rules\" they are expected to follow by society.\nThese modified \"rules\" for lesbian, gay and bisexual people may also be oppressive. Morgan examines the plight of homosexuals seeking asylum from homophobic persecution who have been turned away by US customs for \"not being gay enough:\" not conforming sufficiently to standard (Western) conceptions of the gender roles occupied by gays and lesbians.\nLiberation from gender roles and norms also works to enforce them. To be consciously existing outside of a gender role means to constantly acknowledge its existence. Therefore, although gay couples do not exhibit gender roles in the same way a heterosexual couple would, they are not free from gender roles. They still exist in a society that upholds those roles, making their diversion notable. Because gender roles and sexuality are closely related, where sexuality is seen as diverse or fluid, gender roles could also be seen as such. However, true fluidity would require reframing gender within society. \nConversely, heterosexual men and women who are not perceived as being sufficiently masculine or feminine respectively may be assumed to be homosexual, and persecuted for their perceived homosexuality. In his book \"Female Masculinity\", Jack Halberstam attributes this to the multiple possible masculinities embodied by women and men. Almost no one rigidly follow gender roles and gender norms, but we still consider there to be only two genders. That leads to the punishment of those who do not fit into our typical ideas of masculine and feminine. \nCommunication.\nGender communication is viewed as a form of intercultural communication; and gender is both an influence on and a product of communication.\nCommunication plays a large role in the process in which people become male or female because each gender is taught different linguistic practices. Gender is dictated by society through expectations of behavior and appearances, and then is shared from one person to another, by the process of communication. Gender does not create communication, communication creates gender.\nFor example, females are often more expressive and intuitive in their communication, but males tend to be instrumental and competitive. In addition, there are differences in accepted communication behaviors for males and females. To improve communication between genders, people who identify as either male or female must understand the differences between each gender.\nAs found by Cara Tigue (McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada) the importance of powerful vocal delivery for women in leadership could not be underestimated, as famously described in accounts of Margaret Thatcher's years in power.\nNonverbal communication.\nHall published an observational study on nonverbal gender differences and discussed the cultural reasons for these differences. In her study, she noted women smile and laugh more and have a better understanding of nonverbal cues. She believed women were encouraged to be more emotionally expressive in their language, causing them to be more developed in nonverbal communication.\nMen, on the other hand, were taught to be less expressive, to suppress their emotions, and to be less nonverbally active in communication and more sporadic in their use of nonverbal cues. Most studies researching nonverbal communication described women as being more expressively and judgmentally accurate in nonverbal communication when it was linked to emotional expression; other nonverbal expressions were similar or the same for both genders.\nMcQuiston and Morris also noted a major difference in men and women's nonverbal communication. They found that men tend to show body language linked to dominance, like eye contact and interpersonal distance, more than women.\nCommunication and gender cultures.\nAccording to author Julia Wood, there are distinct communication 'cultures' for women and men in the US. She believes that in addition to female and male communication cultures, there are also specific communication cultures for African Americans, older people, Native Americans, gay men, lesbians, and people with disabilities. According to Wood, it is generally thought that biological sex is behind the distinct ways of communicating, but in her opinion the root of these differences is gender.\nMaltz and Broker's research suggested that the games children play may contribute to socializing children into masculine and feminine gender roles: for example, girls being encouraged to play \"house\" may promote stereotypically feminine traits, and may promote interpersonal relationships as playing house does not necessarily have fixed rules or objectives; boys tended to play more competitive and adversarial team sports with structured, predetermined goals and a range of confined strategies.\nIn religion.\nDifferent religious and cultural groups within one country may have different norms that they attempt to \"police\" within their own groups, including gender norms.\nChristianity.\nThe roles of women in Christianity can vary considerably today (as they have varied historically since the first century church). This is especially true in marriage and in formal ministry positions within certain Christian denominations, churches, and parachurch organizations.\nMany leadership roles in the organized church have been restricted to males. In the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches, only men may serve as priests or deacons, and in senior leadership positions such as pope, patriarch, and bishop. Women may serve as abbesses. Some mainstream Protestant denominations are beginning to relax their longstanding constraints on ordaining women to be ministers, though some large groups are tightening their constraints in reaction. Many subsets of the Charismatic and Pentecostal movements have embraced the ordination of women since their founding.\nChristian \"saints\", persons of exceptional holiness of life having attained the beatific vision (heaven), can include female saints. Most prominent is Mary, mother of Jesus who is highly revered throughout Christianity, particularly in the Catholic and Orthodox churches where she is considered the \"Theotokos\", i.e. \"Mother of God\". Women prominent in Christianity have included contemporaries of Jesus, subsequent theologians, abbesses, mystics, doctors of the church, founders of religious orders, military leaders, monarchs and martyrs, evidencing the variety of roles played by women within the life of Christianity. Paul the Apostle held women in high regard and worthy of prominent positions in the church, though he was careful not to encourage disregard for the New Testament household codes, also known as New Testament Domestic Codes or \"Haustafelen\", of Greco-Roman law in the first century.\nIslam.\nAccording to Dhami and Sheikh, gender roles in Muslim countries are centered on the importance of the family unit, which is viewed as the basis of a balanced and healthy society. Islamic views on gender roles and family are traditionally conservative.\nMany Muslim-majority countries, most prominently Saudi Arabia, have interpretations of religious doctrine regarding gender roles embedded in their laws. In the United Arab Emirates, non-Muslim Western women can wear crop tops, whereas Muslim women are expected to dress much more modestly when in public. In some Muslim countries, these differences are sometimes even codified in law.\nIn some Muslim-majority countries, even non-Muslim women are expected to follow Muslim female gender norms and Islamic law to a certain extent, such as by covering their hair. (Women visiting from other countries sometimes object to this norm and sometimes decide to comply on pragmatic grounds, in the interest of their own safety , such as \"modest\" dress codes which failing to abide by risk being perceived as a prostitute.)\nIslamic prophet Muhammad described the high status of mothers in both of the major hadith collections (Bukhari and Muslim). One famous account is:\n\"A man asked the Prophet: 'Whom should I honor most?' The Prophet replied: 'Your mother'. 'And who comes next?' asked the man. The Prophet replied: 'Your mother'. 'And who comes next?' asked the man. The Prophet replied: 'Your mother!'. 'And who comes next?' asked the man. The Prophet replied: 'Your father!'\"The Qur'an prescribes that the status of a woman should be nearly as high as that of a man.\nHow gender roles are honored is largely cultural. While some cultures encourage men and women to take on the same roles, others promote a more traditional, less dominant role for the women.\nHinduism.\nHindu deities are more ambiguously gendered than the deities of other world religions. This informs female and males relations, and informs how the differences between males and females are understood. However, in a religious cosmology like Hinduism, which prominently features female and androgynous deities, some gender transgression is allowed. This group is known as the hijras, and has a long tradition of performing in important rituals, such as the birth of sons and weddings. Despite this allowance for transgression, Hindu cultural traditions portray women in contradictory ways. Women's fertility is given great value, but female sexuality is depicted as potentially dangerous and destructive.\nIn the workplace.\nGender stereotypes can disadvantage women during the hiring process. It is one explanation for the lack of women in key organizational positions. Management and similar leader positions are often perceived to be \"masculine\" in type, meaning they are assumed to require aggressiveness, competitiveness, strength and independence. These traits do not line up with the perceived traditional female gender role stereotype. (This is often referred to as the \"lack of fit\" model which describes the dynamics of the gender bias.) Therefore, the perception that women do not possess these \"masculine\" qualities, limits their ability to be hired or promoted into managerial positions.\nOne's performance at work is also evaluated based on one's gender. If a female and a male worker show the same performance, the implications of that performance vary depending on the person's gender and on who observes the performance; if a man performs exceedingly well he is perceived as driven or goal-oriented and generally seen in a positive light while a woman showing a similar performance is often described using adjectives with negative connotations. Female performance is therefore not evaluated neutrally or unbiased and stereotyped in ways to deem their equivalent levels and quality of work as instead of lesser value.\nA study in 2001 found that if a woman does act according to female stereotypes, she is likely to receive backlash for not being competent enough; if she does not act according to the stereotypes connected to her gender and behaves more masculine, it is likely to cause backlash through third-party punishment or further job discrimination. This puts women in the workforce in a precarious, \"double bind\" situation. A proposed step to protect women is the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment, as it would prohibit gender-based discrimination regardless of if a woman is acting according to female gender stereotypes, or in defiance of them.\nConsequently, that gender stereotype filter leads to a lack of fair evaluation and, in turn, to fewer women occupying higher paying positions. Gender stereotypes contain women at certain, lower levels; getting trapped within the glass ceiling. While the number of women in the workforce occupying management positions is slowly increasing, women currently fill only 2.5% of the higher managerial positions in the United States. The fact that most women are being allocated to occupations that pay less, is often cited as a contributor to the existing gender pay gap.\nIn relation to white women, women of color are disproportionally affected by the negative influence their gender has on their chances in the labor market. In 2005, women held only 14.7% of Fortune 500 board seats with 79% of them being white and 21% being women of color. This difference is understood through intersectionality, a term describing the multiple and intersecting oppressions an individual might experience. Activists during second-wave feminism have also used the term \"horizontal oppressions\" to describe this phenomenon. It has also been suggested that women of color in addition to the glass ceiling, face a \"concrete wall\" or a \"sticky floor\" to better visualize the barriers.\nLiberal feminist theory states that due to these systemic factors of oppression and discrimination, women are often deprived of equal work experiences because they are not provided equal opportunities on the basis of legal rights. Liberal feminists further propose that an end needs to be put to discrimination based on gender through legal means, leading to equality and major economic redistributions.\nWhile activists have tried calling on Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to provide an equal hiring and promotional process, that practice has had limited success. The pay gap between men and women is slowly closing. Women make approximately 21% less than their male counterparts according to the Department of Labor. This number varies by age, race, and other perceived attributes of hiring agents. A proposed step towards solving the problem of the gender pay gap and the unequal work opportunities is the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment which would constitutionally guarantee equal rights for women. This is hoped to end gender-based discrimination and provide equal opportunities for women.\nIn sports.\nAs strength has been strongly associated to masculinity for many years, sports have evolved into a significant representation of expressions of masculinity and hence, are commonly perceived as a predominantly male domain. However, this does not completely neglect the position and role of women in sports. This is evident from the number of females participating in sport has increasing in recent years.\nAs the belief in gender stereotypes is continuously upheld in society, sporting events have been divided according to how the sport is characterised, which leads to the conceptualisation of male and female sports. Certain traits and sporting events in the sport domain have conventionally been attributed to males and the rest to females. Female sports, expressing the concepts of femininity, are often characterised with flexibility and balance, such as gymnastics or aesthetic sports like dance. Conversely, male sports constitute the idea of masculinity, which is portrayed through strength, speed, aggression and power, such as in football and basketball.\nThe element of beauty in women's sport seems to play a crucial role in the perceived femininity of a sport. This could be due to it being a vital facet in the general concept of femininity itself. The objectification of the female form persists, with women being conditioned to utilize their bodies for the satisfaction of others and to measure their looks against the prevailing feminine standard. The devaluation of female athleticism due their bodies can be seen in the sport uniforms, where in some sports, such as beach volleyball, gymnastics and figure skating, males and females don different uniforms in competitions. In the aforementioned sports, female uniforms expose more of their bodies than the male uniforms do despite the lack of evidence that such uniforms would significantly improve their skills.\nWhile the distinction between male and female sports exist, females participating in male sports is more socially acceptable than the reverse, as questions would arise regarding the masculinity of males competing in the female sports. In a study conducted by Klomsten et al. (2005), they discovered that a majority of the females believed that certain sports are better suited for girls than for boys. Hence, they inferred that females do not prefer the idea of males, known to be strong and masculine, participating in feminine sports.\nSport media coverage of males and females differ significantly and this could attribute to the perpetuation of stereotypical gender roles as well as adversely influencing perceptions of women's abilities. Male athletes are often portrayed based on their strength and physical prowess, while female athletes are more frequently depicted in relation to their physical attractiveness and, at times, their sexualized attributes.\nDespite the increasing participation and remarkable achievements of female athletes, media coverage of women's sport have yet to catch up with this significant advancement. Female athletes and women's sport receive notably less media attention compared to their male counterparts across various forms of media, and this underrepresentation has worsened over the years, despite the rising levels of female participation and performance.\nThe depiction of female athletes and women's sport in the media also tends to vary in terms of tone, production quality in a manner that minimises their efforts and performance. One prevalent practice in sport media coverage is the use of gender marking. The presentation of male athletes and men's sport is regarded as the standard, while their female counterparts are often considered as the \"other\" or outside of this norm, as seen in the naming of events, such as \"Women's World Cup\" while the men's event being simply named as the \"World Cup\". The use of first names and being referred to as \"girls\" or \"young ladies\" for female athletes is also seen as infantilizing, which reinforces the lower regard for female athletes and perpetuates pre-existing negative perceptions of women's sport. The quality of production and filming of men's and women's sport, such as the use of on-screen graphics, shot variations, duration of video frames and camera angles, are also significantly distinct. This influences the audience perceptions by illustrating women's sport as less significant and engaging. Thus, female athletes not only face a lack of media coverage, but the little amount of coverage tends to reinforce the hegemonic masculinity present in sport.\nWhile online sites that promote and cover female athletes exist, these coverages are primarily only found in \"niche\" sites, which continues to pose challenges in overcoming the prevailing ideology of hegemonic masculinity deeply rooted in sports. Therefore, despite the growing participation and outstanding athletic achievements of girls and women, female athletes and women's sports still have a long way to go in achieving equal treatment and fair representation in sports media coverage.\nIn media.\nIn today's society, media saturates nearly every aspect of one's life. It seems inevitable for society to be influenced by the media and what it is portraying. Roles are gendered, meaning that both males and females are viewed and treated differently according to biological sex, and because gendered roles are learned, the media has a direct impact on individuals. Thinking about the way in which couples act on romantic television shows or movies and the way women are portrayed as passive in magazine ads, reveals a lot about how gender roles are viewed in society and in heterosexual marriages. Traditional gendered roles view the man as a \"pro-creator, a protector, and a provider,\" and the woman as \"pretty and polite but not too aggressive, not too outspoken and not too smart.\" Media aids in society conforming to these traditional gendered views. People learn through imitation and social-interaction both in the physical world and through the media; television, magazines, advertisements, newspapers, the Internet, etc. Michael Messner argues that \"gendered interactions, structure, and cultural meanings are intertwined, in both mutually reinforcing and contradictory ways.\"\nWomen are also largely under-represented across multiple types of media. A statistical disparity of the male to female ratio shown on television has existed for decades and is constantly changing and improving. Three decades ago findings highlight that males outnumbered females on a ratio of 2.5 to 1. A decade later this number was at 1.66 men for every woman, and in 2008 the ratio was 1.2 to 1 in the US. In 2010 it was found that the ratio of men to women in successful G-rate movies is 2.57 to 1. Notable social theory such as Bandura's social cognitive theory highlights the importance of seeing people in media that are similar to oneself. In other words it is valuable for girls to see similarities to those represented in media.\nTelevision's influence on society, specifically the influence of television advertisements, is shown in studies such as that of J\u00f6rg Matthes, Michael Prieler, and Karoline Adam. Their study into television advertising has shown that women are much more likely to be shown in a setting in the home compared to men. The study also shows that women are shown much less in work-like settings. This underrepresentation in television advertising is seen in many countries around the world, but is very present in developed countries. In another study in the \"Journal of Social Psychology,\" many television advertisements in countries around the world are seen targeting women at different times of the day than men. Advertisements for products directed towards female viewers are shown during the day on weekdays, while products for men are shown during weekends. The same article shows that a study on adults and television media has also seen that the more television adults watch, the more likely they are to believe or support the gender roles that are illustrated. The support of the presented gender stereotypes can lead to a negative view of feminism or sexual aggression.\nIt has been presented in a journal article by Emerald Group Publishing Limited that adolescent girls have been affected by the stereotypical view of women in media. Girls feel pressured and stressed to achieve a particular appearance, and there have been negative consequences for the young girls if they fail to achieve this look. These consequences have ranged from anxiety to eating disorders. In an experiment described in this journal article, young girls described pictures of women in advertisements as unrealistic and fake; the women were dressed in revealing clothing which sexualised them and exposed their thin figures, which were gazed upon by the public, creating an issue with stereotyping in the media.\nIt has also been presented that children are affected by gender roles in the media. Children's preferences in television characters are most likely to be to characters of the same gender. Because children favor characters of the same gender, the characteristics of the character are also looked to by children. Another journal article by Emerald Group Publishing Limited examined the underrepresentation of women in children's television shows between 1930 and 1960. While studies between 1960 and 1990 showed an increase in the representation of women in television, studies conducted between 1990 and 2005, a time when women were considered to be equal to men by some, show no change in the representation of women in children's television shows. Women, being underrepresented in children's television shows, are also often portrayed as married or in a relationship, while men are more likely to be single. This reoccurring theme in relationship status can be reflected in the ideals of children that only see this type of representation.\nGender Roles in Social Media.\nSocial media has become an integral part of daily life for nearly everyone, serving as a dominant source of information and communication. Women's presentation on social media is directly influenced, with platforms utilizing metrics like numbers and publicity to endorse certain ideals in posts. Perceptions propagated through social media significantly shape real-life thinking and opinions regarding gender. According to professor Brook Duffy at Cornell University, social media operates as a meritocracy, yet women's voices are often underrepresented and carry less weight in the public sphere.\nThe creation of an online identity on social media can also lead to the perpetuation of false narratives about gender, setting unrealistic standards for both women and men. Body image plays a significant role in this, particularly affecting the mental health of young women and men who internalize beauty standards portrayed online, leading to dissatisfaction and harassment. A survey conducted by the Pew Research Center found that women are more likely to have multiple social media accounts, making them more likely to internalize their body image and be influenced by the cultural stereotypes of female beauty. The emphasis on body image on social media platforms fosters daily comparisons and exposes individuals to sexualized media, increasing self-image insecurity. Furthermore, social media has also contributed to the spread of sexist beliefs and sexualized images of men. However, hashtags like #loveyourself and #allbodiesarebeautiful have sparked movements to challenge these standards.\nDespite these challenges, social media has also created new opportunities for women in the workplace, particularly as influencers. However, gender disparities persist, with male influencers generally outperforming their female counterparts. Additionally, media contents across various platforms perpetuate gender stereotypes, with women often portrayed in cosmetic and fashion advertisements, while men are associated with gaming and knowledge. On an economic aspect, social media is driven by gendered advertisements and commercials, often reinforcing stereotypical representations of gender. Algorithms on social media platforms can further exacerbate discriminatory recommendations, reflecting the biases of programmers. Overall, social media's influence on gender norms is profound, shaping perceptions, behaviors, and opportunities in both virtual and real-life settings.\nOnline.\nAn example of gender stereotypes assumes those of the male gender are more 'tech savvy' and happier working online, however, a study done by Hargittai &amp; Shafer, shows that many women also typically have lower self-perceived abilities when it comes to use of the World Wide Web and online navigation skills. Because this stereotype is so well known many women assume they lack such technical skills when in reality, the gap in technological skill level between men and women is significantly less than many women assume.\nIn the journal article written by Elizabeth Behm-Morawitz video games have been guilty of using sexualised female characters, who wear revealing clothing with an 'ideal' figure. It has been shown, female gamers can experience lower self-efficacy when playing a game with a sexualized female character. Women have been stereotyped in online games and have shown to be quite sexist in their appearances. It has been shown these kind of character appearances have influenced peoples' beliefs about gender capabilities by assigning certain qualities to the male and female characters in different games.\nThe concept of gender inequality is often perceived as something that is non-existent within the online community, because of the anonymity possible online. Remote or home-working greatly reduces the volume of information one individual gives another compared to face-to-face encounters, providing fewer opportunities for unequal treatment but it seems real-world notions of power and privilege are being duplicated: people who choose to take up different identities (avatars) in the online world are (still) routinely discriminated against, evident in online gaming where users are able to create their own characters. This freedom allows the user to create characters and identities with a different appearance than their own in reality, essentially allowing them to create a new identity, confirming that regardless of actual gender those who are perceived as female are treated differently.\nIn contrast to the traditional stereotype that gamers are mostly male, a study in 2014 of U.K. residents showed that 52% of the gaming audience was made up of women. The study counted players of mobile games as part of the gaming audience, but still found that 56% of female gamers had played on a console. However, only 12% of game designers in Britain and 3% of all programmers were women.\nDespite the growing number of women who partake in online communities, and the anonymous space provided by the Internet, issues such as gender inequality, the issue has simply been transplanted into the online world.\nIn criminal justice.\nA number of studies conducted since the mid-90s have found direct correlation between a female criminal's ability to conform to gender role stereotypes and the severity of her sentencing, particularly among female murderers. \"In terms of the social realities of justice in America, the experiences of diverse groups of people in society have contributed to the shaping of the types of criminals and victims that we have had. Like Andersen and Hill Collins (1998: 4) in their discussion of what they refer to as a 'matrix of domination,' we too conceive that class, race, and gender represent \"multiple, interlocking levels of domination that stem from the societal configurations of these structural relationships. These patterned actions, in turn, affecting individual consciousness, group interaction, and individual and group access to institutional power and privileges.'\" \"Patterns of offending by men and by women are notable both for their similarities and for their differences. Both men and women are more heavily involved in minor property and substance abuse offenses than in serious crimes like robbery or murder. However, men offend at much higher rates than women for all crime categories except prostitution. This gender gap in crime is greatest for serious crime and least for mild forms of lawbreaking such as minor property crimes.\"\nGender roles in family violence.\nThe 'Family Violence Framework' applies gender dynamics to family violence. \"Families are constructed around relationships that involve obligations and responsibilities, but also status and power\". According to Hattery and Smith, when \"masculinity and femininity are constructed...to generate these rigid and narrow gender roles, it contributes to a culture of violence against women\" \"People with more resources are more likely to be abusive towards those without resources\", meaning that the stronger member of the relationship abuses the weaker partner or family member. However, the fight for power and equality remains \u2013 \"Intimate partner violence in same-sex couples reveals that the rates are similar to those in the heterosexual community\".\nIn economy and society.\nTraditional gender roles assume women will serve as the primary caregivers for children and the elderly, regardless of whether they also work outside of the home. Sociology scholar Arlie Hochschild delves into this phenomenon in her book, \"The Second Shift\". This \"second shift\" refers to the unpaid work women take on in the private sphere\u2014housework, cooking, cleaning, and caring for the family unit. Economically, this restricts a women's ability to advance in her career due to her added (unpaid) responsibilities at home. Gender roles have influenced the idea that women are well suited for more feminine roles such as housekeeping and domestic duties. The OECD found \"Around the world, women spend two to ten times more time on unpaid care work than men.\" In 2020 alone, women provided over $689 billion in unpaid labor to the U.S. economy. Lee and Fang found, \"Compared with Whites, Blacks, Hispanics, and Asian Americans took more extensive caregiving responsibilities.\"\nAcross all demographics, women are more likely to live in poverty compared to men. This is largely due to the gender wage gap between men and women. Correcting these wage gaps would increase women's salaries from an annual average earning of $41,402 to $48,326 increasing the income of the U.S economy. The gender wage gap is largely racial\u2014in the U.S., American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) women, Black women, and Latina women disproportionately experience poverty and larger wage gaps compared with White and Asian women. Women are also more likely to live in poverty if they are single mothers and solely responsible for providing for their children. Poverty among single working mothers would fall 40% or more if women earn equal wages to men.\nSpecifically, in the immigrant demographic, migrant women are subject to lesser benefits and wage gaps compared to that of what migrant men receive. Preceding 1984 to 1994\u20132004, Mexican migrant women earned $6.0 to $7.40 per hour alongside their unpaid domestic responsibilities. Similarly, gender roles apply for immigrant women in the workplace as their skill level does not guarantee equitable participation in the economy. The 1986 immigration policy, impacted the employment of migrant men and women, specifically women with lower wages and higher demands. This trend continued in the United States as immigration policy has persistently been grouped into political affiliations alongside various other social, economic, and geographical factors.\nThe saving rate can differ by gender, with a 2010 study finding lower saving, lower financial literacy and higher risk aversion for women in the United States.\nIn politics.\nPolitical ideologies.\nModern social conservatives tend to support traditional gender roles. Right wing political parties often oppose women's rights and transgender rights. These familialist views are often shaped by the religious fundamentalism, traditional family values, and cultural values of their voter base.\nModern social liberals tend to oppose traditional gender roles, especially for women. Left wing political parties tend to support women's rights and transgender rights. In contrast to social conservatives, their views are more influenced by secularism, feminism, and progressivism.\nIn political office.\nEven though the number of women running for elected office in the United States has increased over the last decades, they still only make up 20% of U.S. senators, 19.4% of U.S. congressional representatives and 24% of statewide executives. Additionally, many of these political campaigns appear to focus on the aggressiveness of the female candidate which is often still perceived as a masculine trait. Therefore, female candidates are running based on gender-opposing stereotypes because that predicts higher likelihood of success than appearing to be a stereotypical woman.\nElections of increasing numbers of women into office serves as a basis for many scholars to claim that voters are not biased towards a candidate's gender. However, it has been shown that female politicians are perceived as only being superior when it comes to handling women's rights and poverty, whereas male politicians are perceived to be better at dealing with crime and foreign affairs. That view lines up with the most common gender stereotypes.\nIt has also been predicted that gender highly matters only for female candidates that have not been politically established. These predictions apply further to established candidates, stating that gender would not be a defining factor for their campaigns or the focal point of media coverage. This has been refuted by multiple scholars, often based on Hillary Clinton's multiple campaigns for the office of President of the United States.\nAdditionally, when voters have little information about a female candidate, they are likely to view her as being a stereotypical woman which they often take as a basis for not electing her because they consider typical male qualities as being crucial for someone holding a political office.\nFeminism and women's rights.\nThroughout the 20th century, women in the United States saw a dramatic shift in social and professional aspirations and norms. Following the Women's Suffrage Movement of the late-nineteenth century, which resulted in the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment allowing women to vote, and in combination with conflicts in Europe, WWI and WWII, women found themselves shifted into the industrial workforce. During this time, women were expected to take up industrial jobs and support the troops abroad through the means of domestic industry. Moving from \"homemakers\" and \"caregivers\", women were now factory workers and \"breadwinners\" for the family.\nHowever, after the war, men returned home to the United States and women, again, saw a shift in social and professional dynamics. With the reuniting of the nuclear family, the ideals of American Suburbia boomed. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, middle-class families moved in droves from urban living into newly developed single-family homes on former farmland just outside major cities. Thus established what many modern critics describe as the \"private sphere\". Though frequently sold and idealized as \"perfect living\", many women had difficulty adjusting to the new \"private sphere\". Writer Betty Friedan described this discontent as \"the feminine mystique\". The \"mystique\" was derived from women equipped with the knowledge, skills, and aspirations of the workforce, the \"public sphere\", who felt compelled whether socially or morally to devote themselves to the home and family.\nOne major concern of feminism, is that women occupy lower-ranking job positions than men, and do most of the housework. A recent (October 2009) report from the Center for American Progress, \"The Shriver Report: A Woman's Nation Changes Everything\" tells us that women now make up 48% of the US workforce and \"mothers are breadwinners or co-breadwinners in a majority of families\" (63.3%, see figure 2, page 19 of the Executive Summary of The Shriver Report).\nAnother recent article in \"The New York Times\" indicates that young women today are closing the pay gap. Luisita Lopez Torregrosa has noted, \"Women are ahead of men in education (last year, 55 percent of U.S. college graduates were female). And a study shows that in most U.S. cities, single, childless women under 30 are making an average of 8 percent more money than their male counterparts, with Atlanta and Miami in the lead at 20 percent.\"\nFeminist theory generally defines gender as a social construct that includes ideologies governing feminine/masculine (female/male) appearances, actions, and behaviors. An example of these gender roles would be that males were supposed to be the educated breadwinners of the family, and occupiers of the public sphere whereas, the female's duty was to be a homemaker, take care of her husband and children, and occupy the private sphere. According to contemporary gender role ideology, gender roles are continuously changing. This can be seen in Londa Schiebinger's \"Has Feminism Changed Science\", in which she states, \"Gendered characteristics \u2013 typically masculine or feminine behaviors, interests, or values-are not innate, nor are they arbitrary. They are formed by historical circumstances. They can also change with historical circumstances.\"\nOne example of the contemporary definition of gender was depicted in Sally Shuttleworth's \"Female Circulation\" in which the, \"abasement of the woman, reducing her from an active participant in the labor market to the passive bodily existence to be controlled by male expertise is indicative of the ways in which the ideological deployment of gender roles operated to facilitate and sustain the changing structure of familial and market relations in Victorian England.\" In other words, this shows what it meant to grow up into the roles (gender roles) of a female in Victorian England, which transitioned from being a homemaker to being a working woman and then back to being passive and inferior to males. In conclusion, gender roles in the contemporary sex gender model are socially constructed, always changing, and do not really exist since they are ideologies that society constructs in order for various benefits at various times in history.\nMen's rights.\nThe men's rights movement (MRM) is a part of the larger men's movement. It branched off from the men's liberation movement in the early-1970s. The men's rights movement is made up of a variety of groups and individuals who are concerned about what they consider to be issues of male disadvantage, discrimination and oppression. The movement focuses on issues in numerous areas of society (including family law, parenting, reproduction, domestic violence) and government services (including education, compulsory military service, social safety nets, and health policies) that they believe discriminate against men.\nScholars consider the men's rights movement or parts of the movement to be a backlash to feminism. The men's rights movement denies that men are privileged relative to women.\nThe movement is divided into two camps: those who consider men and women to be harmed equally by sexism, and those who view society as endorsing the degradation of men and upholding female privilege.\nMen's rights groups have called for male-focused governmental structures to address issues specific to men and boys including education, health, work and marriage. Men's rights groups in India have called for the creation of a Men's Welfare Ministry and a National Commission for Men, as well as the abolition of the National Commission for Women. In the United Kingdom, the creation of a Minister for Men analogous to the existing Minister for Women, have been proposed by David Amess, MP and Lord Northbourne, but were rejected by the government of Tony Blair. In the United States, Warren Farrell heads a commission focused on the creation of a \"White House Council on Boys and Men\" as a counterpart to the \"White House Council on Women and Girls\" which was formed in March 2009.\nRelated to this is the Father's Rights Movement, whose members seek social and political reforms that affect fathers and their children. These individuals contest that societal institutions such as family courts, and laws relating to child custody and child support payments, are gender biased in favor of mothers as the default caregiver. They therefore are systemically discriminatory against males regardless of their actual caregiving ability, because males are typically seen as the bread-winner, and females as the care-giver.\nGender neutrality.\nGender neutrality is the movement to end discrimination of gender altogether in society through means of gender neutral language, the end of sex segregation and other means.\nTransgender and cross-dressing.\nTransgender is the state of one's gender identity or gender expression not matching one's assigned sex. Transgender is independent of sexual orientation; transgender people may identify as heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, etc.; some may consider conventional sexual orientation labels inadequate or inapplicable to them. The definition of \"transgender\" includes:\nWhile people self-identify as transgender, the transgender identity umbrella includes sometimes-overlapping categories. These include transsexual; cross-dresser; genderqueer; androgyne; and bigender. Usually not included are transvestic fetishists (because it is considered to be a paraphilia rather than gender identification), and drag kings and drag queens, who are performers who cross-dress for the purpose of entertaining. In an interview, celebrity drag queen RuPaul talked about society's ambivalence to the differences in the people who embody these terms. \"A friend of mine recently did the \"Oprah\" show about transgender youth\", said RuPaul. \"It was obvious that we, as a culture, have a hard time trying to understand the difference between a drag queen, transsexual, and a transgender, yet we find it very easy to know the difference between the American baseball league and the National baseball league, when they are both so similar.\"\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "43097", "revid": "31882102", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43097", "title": "Gender dysphoria", "text": "Mental distress due to gender incongruence\nMedical condition&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Infobox/styles-images.css\" /&gt;\nMedical condition&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Infobox/styles-images.css\" /&gt;\nGender dysphoria (GD) is the distress a person experiences due to inconsistency between their gender identity\u2014their personal sense of their own gender\u2014and their sex assigned at birth. The term replaced the previous diagnostic label of gender identity disorder (GID) in 2013 with the release of the diagnostic manual DSM-5. The condition was renamed to remove the stigma associated with the term \"disorder\". The ICD-11, which does not consider it a mental disorder, uses the term gender incongruence (GI) instead of \"gender dysphoria\", defined as a marked and persistent mismatch between gender identity and assigned sex, regardless of distress or impairment.\nNot all transgender people have gender dysphoria. Gender nonconformity is not the same thing as gender dysphoria and does not always lead to dysphoria or distress. In pre-pubertal youth, the diagnoses are gender dysphoria in childhood and gender incongruence of childhood.\nThe causes of gender incongruence are unknown but a gender identity likely reflects genetic, biological, environmental, and cultural factors. \nDiagnosis can be given at any age, although gender dysphoria in children and adolescents may manifest differently than in adults. Complications may include anxiety, depression, and eating disorders. Treatment for gender dysphoria includes social transitioning and often includes hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or gender-affirming surgeries, and psychotherapy.\nSome researchers and transgender people argue for the declassification of the condition because they say the diagnosis pathologizes gender variance and reinforces the binary model of gender. However, this declassification could carry implications for healthcare accessibility, as HRT and gender-affirming surgery could be deemed cosmetic by insurance providers, as opposed to medically necessary treatment, thereby affecting coverage.\nSigns and symptoms.\nIn the DSM-5, a marked incongruence between a person's felt gender and assigned sex or gender (usually at birth) is the core component of the diagnosis, which requires distress about the incongruence. In pre-pubertal youth it may manifest as an insistence that they are, or will grow up to be, another gender than the one assigned at birth, an aversion to their assigned gender, or an insistence they have or desire to have different genitalia. They may express aversions to stereotypically gendered activities and desire opposite sex-typical toys, games, activities, or playmates though this may be less prominent in surroundings with fewer stereotypes.\nThe DSM-5 states that gender dysphoria tends to be early-onset (starting prior to puberty) or late-onset (starting during or after puberty) in non-intersex individuals. Those with early-onset GD which continues into adolescence mostly identify as heterosexual, being attracted to their assigned gender at birth. In some cases, the GD desists or is denied, during which the youth may identify as lesbian or gay, though some may experience a later resurgence in GD. Some of those with late-onset GD report desire to transition during childhood that was not verbalized and others have no recollections of childhood gender dysphoria. According to the \"American Psychiatric Association\", those who experience gender dysphoria later in life \"often report having secretly hidden their gender dysphoric feelings from others when they were younger\". No particular sexual orientation indicates gender dysphoria. A 2021 review in Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience found no relation to sexual orientation, but acknowledged that historically the two were often erroneously conflated. The British National Health Service also stated \"gender dysphoria is not related to sexual orientation\".\nCauses.\nIn a 2020 position statement, the Endocrine Society stated that in the late 20th century, transgender and gender incongruent people were thought to suffer a mental health disorder and gender identity was considered malleable and subject to external influences. But that this was no longer considered valid as \"Considerable scientific evidence has emerged demonstrating a durable biological element underlying gender identity. Individuals may make choices due to other factors in their lives, but there do not seem to be external forces that genuinely cause individuals to change gender identity\".\nThe cited evidence includes that attempts to change the gender identity of intersex patients to match their genitalia or chromosomes are generally unsuccessful, that there is evidence that higher levels of exposure to androgens in utero causes higher rates of male gender identity among those with female chromosomes, that those with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome among those with male chromosomes typically have a female gender identity, that identical twins are more likely to both be transgender than non-identical twins, and that brain scans have shown associations with gender identity rather than genitalia or chromosomes.\nTheir 2017 clinical practice guidelines stated \"Results of studies from a variety of biomedical disciplines\u2014genetic, endocrine, and neuroanatomic\u2014support the concept that gender identity and/or gender expression likely reflect a complex interplay of biological, environmental, and cultural factors\" and noted research pointing to unique brain phenotype associated with gender dysphoria and gender incongruence, heritability of the conditions, the role of pre- and post-natal androgens in gender development, and gender identities among intersex people.\nDiagnosis.\nDSM-5.\nThe American Psychiatric Association permits a diagnosis of \"gender dysphoria\" in adolescents or adults if two or more of the following criteria are experienced for at least six months' duration:\nIn addition, the condition must be associated with clinically significant distress or impairment.\nThe diagnosis also contains two specifiers:\nThe DSM-5 stated that \"Gender dysphoria as a general descriptive term refers to the distress that may accompany the incongruence between one's experienced or expressed gender and one's assigned gender. However, it is more specifically defined when used as a diagnostic category. It does not refer to distress related to stigma, a distinct although possibly co-occurring source of distress.\"\nNeither the DSM-I (1952) nor the DSM-II (1968) contained a diagnosis analogous to gender dysphoria. Gender identity disorder first appeared as a diagnosis in the DSM-III (1980), where it appeared under \"psychosexual disorders\" but was used only for the childhood diagnosis. Adolescents and adults received a diagnosis of transsexualism (homosexual, heterosexual, or asexual type). The DSM-III-R (1987) added \"Gender Identity Disorder of Adolescence and Adulthood, Non-Transsexual Type\" (GIDAANT). The DSM-5 moved this diagnosis out of the sexual disorders category and into a category of its own. The diagnosis was renamed from gender identity disorder to gender dysphoria, after criticisms that the former term was stigmatizing. Subtyping by sexual orientation was deleted. The diagnosis for children was separated from that for adults, as \"gender dysphoria in children\". The creation of a specific diagnosis for children reflects the lesser ability of children to have insight into what they are experiencing, or ability to express it if they have insight. \"Other specified gender dysphoria\" or \"unspecified gender dysphoria\" can be diagnosed if a person does not meet the criteria for gender dysphoria but still has clinically significant distress or impairment. Intersex people are no longer excluded from the diagnosis of GD.\nICD-11.\nThe International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) lists three conditions related to gender identity:\nICD-11 defines gender incongruence as \"a marked and persistent incongruence between an individual's experienced gender and the assigned sex\", with no requirement for significant distress or impairment, and a note that \"gender variant behaviour and preferences alone are not a basis for assigning the diagnosis.\nThe ICD-10 contained the diagnoses \"transsexualism\" and \"gender identity disorder of children\" under the \"Mental and behavioral disorders\" chapter. The ICD-11 renamed the conditions \"gender incongruence of adolescence\" or adulthood and \"gender incongruence of childhood\" and moved them into the chapter \"Conditions related to sexual health\" to reflect \"current knowledge that trans-related and gender diverse identities are not conditions of mental ill-health, and that classifying them as such can cause enormous stigma\". The World Health Organization said its inclusion in the ICD-11 \"should ensure transgender people's access to gender-affirming health care\" and health insurance.\nCo-occurring conditions.\nSeveral psychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions have been observed to disproportionately co-occur with gender dysphoria. Comorbidity with psychiatric diagnoses has been found in 62.7% of individuals with GD. Major depressive disorder, mood disorders, anxiety, and substance abuse are all seen in disproportionate levels in people with GD compared to adults without it. \nGender dysphoria's frequent co-occurrence with psychiatric and psychological disorders is seen within youth populations in addition to adult populations. Among youth, around 20% to 30% of individuals attending gender clinics meet the DSM criteria for an anxiety disorder. Gender dysphoria is also associated with an increased risk of eating disorders in transgender youth. In addition, children and adolescents with gender dysphoria are also more likely to have ADHD, depression, and histories of suicidality, self-harm, and adverse childhood experiences.\nA widely held view among clinicians is that there is an over-representation of neurodevelopmental conditions amongst individuals with GD, although this view has been questioned due to the low quality of evidence. Studies on children and adolescents with gender dysphoria have found a high prevalence of autistic traits or a confirmed diagnosis of autism. Adults with gender dysphoria attending specialist gender clinics have also been shown to have high rates of autistic traits or an autism diagnosis as well. It has been estimated that autistic children were over four times as likely to be diagnosed with GD, with autism being reported from 6% to over 20% of teens referring to gender identity services.\nAutistic people are more likely to be gender diverse and in those with gender dysphoria there is an overrepresentation of autistic traits. In prepubertal youth, increasing age is associated with more behavioral and emotional problems due to increasing nonacceptance of gender nonconforming behaviors than others, while children and adolescents in affirming environments show less or no psychological problems. Younger children are also less likely to express extreme and persistent dysphoria about their anatomy.\nTreatment.\nThe Endocrine Society's 2016 clinical practice guideline \"Endocrine Treatment of Gender-Dysphoric/Gender-Incongruent Persons\" notes that gender-affirmation is a multidisciplinary treatment and those with gender dysphoria or incongruence seek or are referred to endocrinologists to develop physical characteristics of the affirmed gender. The hormone regimen aims to suppress endogenous sex hormones and maintain normal sex hormone levels of the affirmed gender. Hormone treatment is not recommended for pre-pubertal youth. Adolescents with gender dysphoria and incongruence are recommended puberty blockers at Tanner Stage 2, when puberty is beginning. Gender-affirming hormones are prescribed after a multidisciplinary team has confirmed the persistence of the dysphoria or incoungrence and capacity for informed consent, which is normally developed by 16 years old.\nWPATH produced the 8th edition of its Standards of Care for the Health of Transgender and Gender Diverse People in 2022 stated \"However, gender incongruence that causes clinically significant distress and impairment often requires medically necessary clinical interventions\" such as endocrine and surgical procedures. Other gender-affirming interventions may include hair removal/transplants, voice therapy/surgery, counseling, and other medical procedures.\nThe AWMF released guidelines in 2025 which found there is \"no proven effective treatment alternative without body-modifying medical measures for a [person with] permanently persistent gender incongruence.\"\nTreatment for a person diagnosed with GD may include psychological counseling, supporting the individual's gender expression (such as through the clothes they wear), or may involve physical transition resulting from medical interventions such as hormonal treatment, genital surgery, electrolysis, laser hair removal, chest surgery, breast surgery or other reconstructive surgeries.\nHistorically, gender identity change efforts (conversion therapy targeting gender identity) were seen as a treatment option for those with gender dysphoria or incongruence, particularly youth. The view that \"transsexualism\" and gender dysphoria were psychological conditions which should only be treated with psychotherapy was the dominant view until the 1970s, though some clinicians continued to hold it afterwards. Attempts to alleviate GD by changing the patient's gender identity to reflect assigned sex have been ineffective and are regarded as conversion therapy by most health organizations. The AWMF guidelines state \"psychotherapy is recommended for co-incident disorders, for which there is already an indication due to the co-incident disorder itself\" but criticized the recommendation of psychotherapy for \"management of [GD] associated distress\" noting that \"none of the studies included in the review in question were able to show a reduction in gender dysphoria through psychotherapy.\"\nChildren.\nMedical, scientific, and governmental organizations have opposed conversion therapy, defined as treatment viewing gender nonconformity as pathological and something to be changed, instead supporting approaches that affirm children's diverse gender identities. People are more likely to keep having gender dysphoria the more intense their gender dysphoria, cross-gendered behavior, and verbal identification with the desired/experienced gender are (i.e. stating that they \"are\" a different gender rather than \"wish to be\" a different gender).\nProfessionals who treat gender dysphoria in children sometimes prescribe puberty blockers to delay the onset of puberty until a child is believed to be old enough to make an informed decision on whether hormonal or surgical gender reassignment is in their best interest. Short-term side effects of puberty blockers include headaches, fatigue, insomnia, muscle aches and changes in breast tissue, mood, and weight. Research on the long-term effects on brain development, cognitive function, fertility, and sexual function is limited.\nA review published in \"Child and Adolescent Mental Health\" found that puberty blockers are reversible, and that they are associated with positive outcomes such as decreased suicidality in adulthood, improved affect and psychological functioning, and improved social life. A later review from 2025, published in \"Frontiers in Endocrinology\", found that puberty blockers \"significantly improve\" mental health, albeit long-term physical safety outcomes remain uncertain.\nAccording to the American Psychiatric Association, \"Due to the dynamic nature of puberty development, lack of gender-affirming interventions (i.e. social, psychological, and medical) is not a neutral decision; youth often experience worsening dysphoria and negative impact on mental health as the incongruent and unwanted puberty progresses. Trans-affirming treatment, such as the use of puberty suppression, is associated with the relief of emotional distress, and notable gains in psychosocial and emotional development, in trans and gender diverse youth\".\nIn its position statement published December 2020, the Endocrine Society stated that there is durable evidence for a biological underpinning to gender identity and that pubertal suppression, hormone therapy, and medically indicated surgery are effective and relatively safe when monitored appropriately and have been established as the standard of care. They noted a decrease in suicidal ideation among youth who have access to gender-affirming care and comparable levels of depression to cisgender peers among socially transitioned pre-pubertal youth. In its 2017 guideline on treating those with gender dysphoria, it recommends puberty blockers be started when the child has started puberty (Tanner Stage 2 for breast or genital development) and cross-sex hormones be started at 16, though they note \"there may be compelling reasons to initiate sex hormone treatment prior to the age of 16 years in some adolescents with GD/gender incongruence\". They recommend a multidisciplinary team of medical and mental health professionals manage the treatment for those under 18 and recommend \"monitoring clinical pubertal development every 3 to 6 months and laboratory parameters every 6 to 12 months during sex hormone treatment\".\nThe World Professional Association for Transgender Health's Standards of Care 8, published in 2022, declare puberty blocking medication as \"medically necessary\", and recommends them for usage in transgender adolescents once the patient has reached Tanner stage 2 of development, and state that longitudinal data shows improved outcomes for transgender patients who receive them. Some medical professionals disagree that adolescents are cognitively mature enough to make a decision with regard to hormone therapy or surgery, and advise that irreversible genital procedures should not be performed on individuals under the age of legal consent in their respective country.\nA review commissioned by the UK Department of Health found that there was very low certainty of quality of evidence about puberty blocker outcomes in terms of mental health, quality of life and impact on gender dysphoria. The Finnish government commissioned a review of the research evidence for treatment of minors and the Finnish Ministry of Health concluded that there are no research-based health care methods for minors with gender dysphoria. Nevertheless, they recommend the use of puberty blockers for minors on a case-by-case basis, and the American Academy of Pediatrics state that \"pubertal suppression in children who identify as TGD [transgender and gender diverse] generally leads to improved psychological functioning in adolescence and young adulthood.\"\nIn the United States, several states have introduced or are considering legislation that would prohibit the use of puberty blockers in the treatment of transgender children. The American Medical Association, the Endocrine Society, the American Psychological Association, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and the American Academy of Pediatrics oppose bans on puberty blockers for transgender children. In the UK, in the case of \"Bell v Tavistock\", an appeal court, overturning the original decision, ruled that children under 16 could give consent to receiving puberty blockers. In 2022, the National Board of Health and Welfare in Sweden issued new guidelines recommending that puberty blockers only be given in \"exceptional cases\" and said that their use was grounded in \"uncertain science\". Instead, they recommended child psychiatric treatment, psychosocial interventions, and suicide prevention measures to be offered by clinicians.\nBiological treatments.\nBiological treatments physically alter primary and secondary sex characteristics to reduce the discrepancy between an individual's physical body and gender identity. Biological treatments for GD are typically undertaken in conjunction with psychotherapy; however, the WPATH Standards of Care state that psychotherapy should not be an absolute requirement for biological treatments.\nHormonal treatments have been shown to reduce a number of symptoms of psychiatric distress associated with gender dysphoria. A WPATH commissioned systematic review of the outcomes of hormone therapy \"found evidence that gender-affirming hormone therapy may be associated with improvements in [quality of life] scores and decreases in depression and anxiety symptoms among transgender people.\" The strength of the evidence was low due to methodological limitations of the studies undertaken. Some literature suggests that gender-affirming surgery is associated with improvements in quality of life and decreased incidence of depression. Those who choose to undergo gender-affirming surgery report high satisfaction rates with the outcome, though these studies have limitations including risk of bias (lack of randomization, lack of controlled studies, self-reported outcomes) and high loss to follow up.\nDisagreement among practitioners regarding treatment of adolescents is in part due to the lack of long-term data. Young people qualifying for biomedical treatment according to the Dutch model (including having GD from early childhood which intensifies at puberty and absence of co-occurring psychiatric conditions that could challenge diagnosis or treatment) found reduction in gender dysphoria, although limitations to these outcome studies have been noted, such as lack of controls or considering alternatives like psychotherapy.\nIn its position statement published December 2020, the Endocrine Society stated that there is durable evidence for a biological underpinning to gender identity and that pubertal suppression, hormone therapy, and medically indicated surgery are effective and relatively safe when monitored appropriately and have been established as the standard of care. They noted a decrease in suicidal ideation among youth who have access to gender-affirming care and comparable levels of depression to cisgender peers among socially transitioned pre-pubertal youth.\nA review published in \"Child and Adolescent Mental Health\" found that puberty blockers are fully reversible, and that they are associated with such positive outcomes as decreased suicidality in adulthood, improved affect and psychological functioning, and improved social life. A later review from 2025, published in \"Frontiers in Endocrinology\", found that puberty blockers \"significantly improve\" mental health, albeit long-term physical safety outcomes remain uncertain.\nMore rigorous studies are needed to assess the effectiveness, safety, and long-term benefits and risks of hormonal and surgical treatments. For instance, a 2020 Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to determine whether feminizing hormones were safe or effective, due to the lack of \"completed studies that met [their] inclusion criteria.\" Several studies have found significant long-term psychological and psychiatric pathology after surgical treatments.\nIn 2021, a review published in \"Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery\" found that about 1% (95% CI &lt;1%\u20132%) of people who undergo gender-affirming surgery regret the decision. It concluded that \"There is an extremely low prevalence of regret in transgender patients after GAS. We believe this study corroborates the improvements made in regard to selection criteria for GAS. However, there is high subjectivity in the assessment of regret and lack of standardized questionnaires, which highlight the importance of developing validated questionnaires in this population.\"\nEpidemiology.\nDifferent studies have arrived at different conclusions about the prevalence of gender dysphoria. The DSM-5 gives a gender dysphoria prevalence of 0.005% to 0.014% of people assigned male at birth (5-14 per 100k) and 0.002% to 0.003% of people assigned female at birth (2-3 per 100k). The DSM-5 states that these numbers are likely underestimates, being based on the number of referrals to specialty clinics. Not all adults seeking medical transition are referred to specialty clinics.\nAccording to \"Black's Medical Dictionary\", gender dysphoria \"occurs in one in 30,000 male births and one in 100,000 female births.\" Studies in European countries in the early 2000s found that about 1 in 12,000 natal male adults (8 per 100k) and 1 in 30,000 (3 per 100k) natal female adults seek out gender-affirming surgery. Studies of hormonal treatment or legal name change find higher prevalence than sex reassignment, with, for example a 2010 Swedish study finding that 1 in 7,750 (13 per 100k) adult natal males and 1 in 13,120 (8 per 100k) adult natal females requested a legal name change to a name of the opposite gender.\nStudies that measure transgender status by self-identification find even greater prevalence of gender identity different from sex assigned at birth (although some of those who identify as transgender or gender nonconforming may not experience clinically significant distress and so do not have gender dysphoria). A study in New Zealand found that 1 in 3,630 natal males (13 per 100k) and 1 in 22,714 (4 per 100k) natal females have changed their legal gender markers. A survey of Massachusetts adults found that 0.5% (500 per 100k) identify as transgender. A national survey in New Zealand of 8,500 randomly selected secondary school students from 91 randomly selected high schools found 1.2% (1,200 per 100k) of students responded \"yes\" to the question \"Do you think you are transgender?\". Outside of a clinical setting, the stability of transgender or non-binary identities is unknown.\nResearch indicates that among people who transition in adulthood, individuals are up to three times more likely to be male assigned at birth. However, among people transitioning in childhood, the sex ratio is closer to 1:1. The prevalence of gender dysphoria in children remains uncertain due to the lack of formal prevalence studies. A 2022 literature review reported that approximately 36% of adolescents assessed in specialized gender clinics were natal males, and 63% were natal females. One study highlighted in the review found no significant change in these proportions from 2014 to 2016. However, when comparing more recent data with earlier studies, there has been a shift favoring natal females (ratio of 1:3) as opposed to nearly equal proportions in earlier studies (ratios of 0.8\u20130.9:1).\nSociety and culture.\nResearchers disagree about the nature of distress and impairment in people with GD. Some authors have suggested that people with GD suffer because they are stigmatized and victimized; and that, if society had less strict gender divisions, transgender people would suffer less.\nSome controversy surrounds the creation of the GD diagnosis, with Davy et al. stating that although the creators of the diagnosis state that it has rigorous scientific support, \"it is impossible to scrutinize such claims, since the discussions, methodological processes, and promised field trials of the diagnosis have not been published.\"\nSome cultures have three or more defined genders. The existence of accepted social categories other than man or woman may alleviate the distress associated with cross-gender identity. For example, in Samoa, the \"fa'afafine\", a group of feminine males, are mostly socially accepted. The fa'afafine appear similar to transgender women in terms of their lifelong identities and gendered behavior, but experience far less distress than do transgender women in Western cultures. This suggests that the distress of gender dysphoria is significantly increased by difficulties encountered from social disapproval by one's culture. Overall, it is unclear whether or not gender dysphoria persists in cultures with third gender categories.\nClassification as a disorder.\nThe psychiatric diagnosis of gender identity disorder (now gender dysphoria) was introduced in DSM-III in 1980. Arlene Istar Lev and Deborah Rudacille have characterized the addition as a political maneuver to re-stigmatize homosexuality. (Homosexuality was declassified as a mental disorder in the DSM-II in 1974.) By contrast, Kenneth Zucker and Robert Spitzer argue that gender identity disorder was included in DSM-III because it \"met the generally accepted criteria used by the framers of DSM-III for inclusion.\" Some researchers, including Spitzer and Paul J. Fink, contend that the behaviors and experiences seen in transsexualism are abnormal and constitute a dysfunction. The American Psychiatric Association stated that gender nonconformity is not the same thing as gender dysphoria, and that \"gender nonconformity is not in itself a mental disorder. The critical element of gender dysphoria is the presence of clinically significant distress associated with the condition.\"\nIndividuals with gender dysphoria may or may not regard their own cross-gender feelings and behaviors as a disorder. Advantages and disadvantages exist to classifying gender dysphoria as a disorder. Because gender dysphoria had been classified as a disorder in medical texts (such as the previous DSM manual, the DSM-IV-TR, under the name \"gender identity disorder\"), many insurance companies are willing to cover some of the expenses of sex reassignment therapy. Without the classification of gender dysphoria as a medical disorder, sex reassignment therapy may be viewed as a cosmetic treatment, rather than medically necessary treatment, and may not be covered. In the United States, transgender people are less likely than others to have health insurance, and often face hostility and insensitivity from healthcare providers. The Americans with Disabilities Act covers individuals with gender dysphoria. Some researchers and transgender people support declassification of the condition because they say the diagnosis pathologizes gender variance and reinforces the binary model of gender.\nAn analysis of the Samoan third gender \"fa'afafine\" suggests that the DSM-IV-TR diagnostic component of distress is not inherent in the cross-gender identity; rather, it is related to social rejection and discrimination suffered by the individual. Psychology professor Darryl Hill insists that gender dysphoria is not a mental disorder, but rather that the diagnostic criteria reflect psychological distress in children that occurs when parents and others have trouble relating to their child's gender variance. Transgender people have often been harassed, socially excluded, and subjected to discrimination, abuse and violence, including murder.\nIn December 2002, the British Lord Chancellor's office published a \"Government Policy Concerning Transsexual People\" document that categorically states, \"What transsexualism is not ... It is not a mental illness.\" In May 2009, the government of France declared that a transsexual gender identity will no longer be classified as a psychiatric condition, but according to French trans rights organizations, beyond the impact of the announcement itself, nothing changed. Denmark made a similar statement in 2016.\nIn the ICD-11, GID is reclassified as \"gender incongruence\", a condition related to sexual health. The working group responsible for this recategorization recommended keeping such a diagnosis in ICD-11 to preserve access to health services.\nGender euphoria.\n\"Gender euphoria\" (GE) is a term for the satisfaction, enjoyment, or relief felt by people when they feel their gender expression matches their personal gender identity. \"Psych Central\"'s definition is \"deep joy when your internal gender identity matches your gender expression.\" It is proposed that feelings of gender euphoria require societal acceptance of gender expression. In academics and the medical field, a consensus has not yet been reached on a precise definition of the term, as it has been mainly used within a social context. The first attempt to rigorously define gender euphoria through an online survey took place in 2021, conducted by Will Beischel, St\u00e9phanie Gauvin, and Sari van Anders. \"Transgender congruence\" is also used to ascribe transgender individuals feeling genuine, authentic, and comfortable with their gender identity and external appearance.\nThe term \"gender euphoria\" has been used by the transgender community since at least the mid-1970s. Originally, it referred to the feeling of joy arising from fulfilling a mix of gender roles, which was different from the concept of gender dysphoria, which is used to describe individuals who wished to medically transition to a different sex. In the 1980s, the term was published in trans contexts, coming up in interviews with trans people. For example, in a 1988 interview with a trans man, the subject states, \"I think that day [Dr. Charles Ilhenfeld] administered my first shot of the 'wonder-drug' must have been one of the 'peak-experiences' of my life -- talk about 'gender euphoria'!\" The interview indicates he is referring to testosterone.\nOther figures, including Mariette Pathy Allen and Virginia Prince, have used the term in their work. In 1990, Virginia Prince used the phrase in the trans magazine \"Femme Mirror,\" ending an article with, \"...from here on you can enjoy GENDER EUPHORIA - HAVE A GOOD LIFE!\" Starting in 1991, a monthly newsletter named \"Gender Euphoria\" was released, featuring articles about transgender topics; Leslie Feinberg read the newsletter to better understand the transgender community. However, there are instances in which gender euphoria has been used with a different meaning, such as in 1979, when the Black feminist Michele Wallace used it to describe the male privilege present in Black men.\nThe term has been embraced as part of a movement to stop pathologizing being transgender. In 1989, Mariette Pathy Allen published an unnamed transgender person's quote in her photography book \"Transformations\": \"The shrinks may call it 'gender dysphoria,' but for some of us, it's gender 'euphoria,' and we're not going to apologize anymore!\" The movement to focus on the positive side of gender expression was also advocated for in 1994, when the Scottish \"TV/TS\" periodical \"The Tartan Skirt\" wrote, \"Let's accentuate the positive, discard the negative, and promote the new condition of 'Gender Euphoria.'\" In 1997, Patrick Califia described transgender activists picketing using signs that read \"Gender Euphoria NOT Gender Dysphoria\" and handing out \"thousands of leaflets\" at protests. The following year, in 1998, \"Second Skins: The Body Narratives of Transsexuality\" reported:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The transactivist group Transexual Menace is campaigning to have the diagnosis \"Gender Identity Disorder\" removed entirely from the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\". \"Gender Euphoria NOT Gender Dysphoria\"; its slogans invert the pathologizing of transgender, offering pride in queer difference as an alternative to the psychiatric story.\nSimilarly, Florence Ashley has advocated for the medical field to focus on helping patients achieve gender euphoria instead of treating patients on the basis of gender dysphoria. They argue that currently, in order for individuals to receive gender-affirming care, they must be diagnosed with gender dysphoria, which is not always accessible and entails people must be experiencing significant distress before they can fully express their own gender identity. Ashley's stance that gender euphoria does not need to be preceded by a clinical diagnosis of gender dysphoria, and that gender euphoria is complex, is echoed by Elliot Tebbe and Stephanie Budge in their 2022 \"Nature Reviews Psychology\" article, in which they write, \"Gender euphoria is not merely the absence of gender dysphoria, but rather a conglomeration of positive emotions and subjective well-being in response to being affirmed in one's gender.\"\nGender euphoria has also been expressed through art. Photography in the East Village in Manhattan has served as means to express gender euphoria, contrasting fashion photography, which is said to reinforce the gender binary.\nIn 2019, the Midsumma festival in Australia hosted \"Gender Euphoria\", a cabaret focusing on \"bliss\" in transgender experiences, including musical, ballet, and burlesque performances. A reviewer described it as \"triumphant \u2013 honest, unpretentious, touching, and a vital celebration\".\nThe 2020 young adult fantasy novel \"Euphoria Kids\" by Alison Evans was also inspired by the concept of gender euphoria. In the book's foreword, Evans wrote: \"I want people to learn about gender euphoria (before) gender dysphoria... I want the young trans kids that will read this book to be proud of who they are, and to imagine wonderful, magic lives for themselves.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "43098", "revid": "27015025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43098", "title": "William A. Dembski", "text": "American mathematician and proponent of intelligent design\nWilliam Albert Dembski (born July 18, 1960) is an American mathematician, philosopher and theologian. He was a proponent of intelligent design (ID) pseudoscience, specifically the concept of specified complexity, and was a senior fellow of the Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture (CSC). On September 23, 2016, he officially retired from intelligent design, resigning all his \"formal associations with the ID community, including [his] Discovery Institute fellowship of 20 years\". A February 2021 interview in the CSC's blog \"Evolution News\" announced \"his return to the intelligent design arena\".\nIn 2012, he taught as the Phillip E. Johnson Research Professor of Science and Culture at the Southern Evangelical Seminary in Matthews, North Carolina, near Charlotte.\nDembski has written books about intelligent design, including \"The Design Inference\" (1998), \"Intelligent Design: The Bridge Between Science &amp; Theology\" (1999), \"The Design Revolution\" (2004), \"The End of Christianity\" (2009), and \"Intelligent Design Uncensored\" (2010).\nIntelligent design is the argument that an intelligent cause is responsible for the complexity of life and that one can detect that cause empirically. Dembski postulated that probability theory can be used to prove irreducible complexity (IC) and what he called \"specified complexity.\" The scientific community sees intelligent design\u2014and Dembski's concept of specified complexity\u2014as a form of creationism.\nBiography.\nDembski was born in Chicago, Illinois, the only child of Catholic parents. His mother was an art dealer and his father was a college professor who held a D.Sc. in biology from the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg and taught evolutionary biology. While growing up, Dembski was neither particularly religious nor did he question the theory of evolution. \nDembski attended an all-male Catholic preparatory school in Chicago. He finished high school a year early, excelling in math and finishing a calculus course in one summer. After high school, Dembski attended the University of Chicago, where he experienced educational and personal difficulties, struggling with the advanced courses and finding the unfamiliar social milieu of college challenging. He dropped out of school and worked at his mother's art business while reading works on creationism and the Bible. Finding the creationist works interesting in their challenge of evolution but their literal interpretations lacking, Dembski returned to school at the University of Illinois at Chicago, studying statistics.\nIt was in 1988 at a conference on randomness that Dembski began to believe that there was purpose, order, and design in the universe by the intervention of God. Remaining in academia, Dembski ultimately completed an undergraduate degree in psychology at the University of Illinois at Chicago in 1981 and master's degrees in statistics, mathematics, and philosophy (1983, University of Illinois at Chicago; 1985, University of Chicago; 1993, University of Illinois at Chicago, respectively), two PhDs, one in mathematics and one in philosophy (1988, University of Chicago; 1996, University of Illinois at Chicago, respectively), and a Master of Divinity in theology at the Princeton Theological Seminary (1996).\nAt the Princeton Theological Seminary, Dembski met his future wife, Jana. Dissatisfied with what he called the \"free-swinging academic style\" of the school, Dembski also was involved in a group known as the Charles Hodge Society. Based on the works of the 19th century thinker Charles Hodge, the group was devoted to strengthening the faith of students faced with what members believed to be the \"theological disarray\" of the times, and to providing an example of how to oppose \"false and destructive ideas.\" It published a journal (a recreation of the \"Princeton Theological Review\" (1903\u20131929)) and met with considerable opposition on the campus, facing two lawsuits, threats of violence, accusations of racism and sexism; being denied funding; and hearing that membership \"jeopardized their academic advancement.\"\nDembski and Jana have one daughter and two sons. One of his sons has autism and Dembski has attributed some of his son's problems to vaccines.\nEarly opposition to evolution.\nDembski holds that his knowledge of statistics and his skepticism concerning evolutionary theory led him to believe that the extraordinary diversity of life was statistically unlikely to have been produced by natural selection. His first significant contribution to intelligent design was his 1991 paper, \"Randomness by Design,\" published in the philosophy journal \"No\u00fbs\".\nFormer UC Berkeley law school professor Phillip E. Johnson's book \"Darwin on Trial\" (1991) attracted a group of scholars who shared his view that the exclusion of supernatural explanations by the scientific method was unfair and had led to the \"Edwards v. Aguillard\" ruling that teaching creation science in public schools was unconstitutional. Dembski was part of that group at a symposium at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas, in March 1992, before they came to call themselves \"The Wedge.\"\nDembski wrote a contribution to the 1994 book \"The Creation Hypothesis\". Another chapter, contributed by the creationists Charles Thaxton and Walter L Bradley, discussed \"design detection\" and redefined \"specified complexity\" as a way of measuring information.\nThese ideas led to Dembski's notion of specified complexity, which he developed in \"The Design Inference\", a 1998 revision of his PhD dissertation in philosophy.\nIn 1987, the phrase \"intelligent design\" replaced \"creation science\" in drafts of a book, \"Of Pandas and People\", that was intended for secondary school students. The phrase referred to the idea that life was created through unspecified processes by an intelligent but unidentified designer. The book asserted that there was a logical need for such a designer because of the appearance of design in biological organisms. This replacement was intended to evade the \"Edwards v. Aguillard\" ruling. The book was published in 1989 amidst campaigning by the publisher for the introduction of \"intelligent design\" into school science classes.\nBiochemist Michael Behe, another member of \"The Wedge,\" contributed the argument that he subsequently called \"irreducible complexity\" to a subsequent edition of \"Pandas\" in 1993. The book contained concepts which Dembski later elaborated in his treatment of \"specified complexity.\"\nDiscovery Institute.\nAfter completing graduate school in 1996, Dembski was unable to secure a university position; from then until 1999 he received what he calls \"a standard academic salary\" of $40,000 a year as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture. \"I was one of the early beneficiaries of Discovery largess,\" says Dembski.\nUntil September 2016, Dembski served as a senior fellow at the CSC, where he played a central role in the center's extensive public and political campaigns advancing the concept of intelligent design and its teaching in public schools through its \"Teach the Controversy\" campaign as part of the institute's wedge strategy. He has since resigned his fellowship position with the Discovery Institute.\nBaylor University.\nMichael Polanyi Center controversy.\nIn 1999, Dembski was invited by Robert B. Sloan, President of Baylor University, to establish the Michael Polanyi Center at the university. Named after the Hungarian physical chemist and philosopher Michael Polanyi (1891\u20131976), Dembski described it as \"the first intelligent design think tank at a research university.\" Dembski had known Sloan for about three years, having taught Sloan's daughter at a Christian study summer camp not far from Waco, Texas. Sloan was the first Baptist minister to serve as Baylor's president in over 30 years, had read some of Dembski's work and liked it; according to Dembski, Sloan \"made it clear that he wanted to get me on the faculty in some way.\" The salaries were supported by a grant from the John Templeton Foundation.\nThe Polanyi Center was established without much publicity in October 1999, initially consisting of two people \u2013 Dembski and a like-minded colleague, Bruce L. Gordon, who were hired directly by Sloan without going through the usual channels of a search committee and departmental consultation. The vast majority of Baylor staff did not know of the center's existence until its website went online, and the center stood outside of the existing religion, science, and philosophy departments.\nThe center's mission, and the lack of consultation with the Baylor faculty, became the immediate subject of controversy. The faculty feared for the university's reputation \u2013 it has historically been well regarded for its contributions to mainstream science \u2013 and scientists outside the university questioned whether Baylor had \"gone fundamentalist.\" Faculty members pointed out that the university's existing interdisciplinary Institute for Faith and Learning was already addressing questions about the relationship between science and religion, making the existence of the Polanyi Center somewhat redundant. In April 2000, Dembski hosted a conference on \"naturalism in science\" sponsored by the John Templeton Foundation and the hub of the intelligent design movement, the Discovery Institute, seeking to address the question \"Is there anything beyond nature?\" Most of the Baylor faculty boycotted the conference.\nA few days later, the Baylor faculty senate voted by a margin of 27\u20132 to ask the administration to dissolve the center and merge it with the Institute for Faith and Learning. President Sloan refused, citing issues of censorship and academic integrity, but agreed to convene an outside committee to review the center. The committee recommended setting up a faculty advisory panel to oversee the science and religion components of the program, dropping the name \"Michael Polanyi\" and reconstituting the center as part of the Institute for Faith and Learning. These recommendations were accepted in full by the university administration.\nIn a subsequent press release, Dembski asserted that the committee had given an \"unqualified affirmation of my own work on intelligent design,\" that its report \"marks the triumph of intelligent design as a legitimate form of academic inquiry\" and that \"dogmatic opponents of design who demanded the Center be shut down have met their Waterloo. Baylor University is to be commended for remaining strong in the face of intolerant assaults on freedom of thought and expression.\"\nDembski's remarks were criticized by other members of the Baylor faculty, who protested that they were both an unjustified attack on his critics at Baylor and a false assertion that the university endorsed Dembski's controversial views on intelligent design. Charles Weaver, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Baylor and one of the most vocal critics of the Polanyi Center, commented: \"In academic arguments, we don't seek utter destruction and defeat of our opponents. We don't talk about Waterloos.\"\nPresident Sloan asked Dembski to withdraw his press release, but Dembski refused, accusing the university of \"intellectual McCarthyism\" (borrowing a phrase that Sloan himself had used when they first tried to dissolve the center). He declared that the university's action had been taken \"in the utmost of bad faith ... thereby providing the fig leaf of justification for my removal.\" Professor Michael Beaty, director of the Institute for Faith and Learning, said that Dembski's remarks violated the spirit of cooperation that the committee had advocated and stated that \"Dr. Dembski's actions after the release of the report compromised his ability to serve as director.\" Dembski was removed as the center's director, although he remained an associate research professor until May 2005. He was not asked to teach any courses in that time and instead worked from home, writing books and speaking around the country. \"In a sense, Baylor did me a favor,\" he said. \"I had a five-year sabbatical.\"\nSeminary teaching.\nFrom 1999 to 2005, he was on the faculty of Baylor University, where he was a focus of attention and controversy. During the academic year 2005\u20132006, he was briefly the \"Carl F. H. Henry Professor of Theology and Science\" at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky, as well as the first director of the school's new Center for Theology and Science (since replaced by prominent creationist Kurt Wise). The seminary teaches creationism but its professors vary on the details, with most adhering to the young Earth creationist viewpoint of a relatively recent creation which occurred literally as described in Genesis; Dembski does not hold to young Earth creationism (YEC). On his position at Southern, Dembski also remarked that \"Theology is where my ultimate passion is and I think that is where I can uniquely contribute.\" He left Southern in May 2006. Starting in June 2006 he became a professor in philosophy at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary (SWBTS) in Fort Worth, Texas. Since taking up a position within Southwestern's School of Theology in June 2006, Dembski has taught a number of courses within its Department of Philosophy of Religion. For some of his courses, he requires that his students promote intelligent design on \"hostile\" websites for course credit. The Southern Baptist Convention operates both seminaries.\nIn September 2007, the SWBTS hosted a conference, \"Intelligent Design in Business Practice,\" presented by Dembski, Acton Institute theologian Jay Richards, and three business academics presently or formerly teaching at universities in the Southern United States.\nMims\u2013Pianka controversy.\nOn April 2, 2006, Dembski stated on his blog that he reported Eric Pianka to the Department of Homeland Security because he and fellow Discovery Institute Fellow Forrest Mims felt that Pianka's speech while accepting the Texas Academy of Science's Distinguished Texas Scientist Award in 2006 fomented bioterrorism. This resulted in the Federal Bureau of Investigation interviewing Pianka in Austin. On April 5, Dembski wagered that Pianka's popularity would drop if the full text of his speech to the Texas Academy of Science were made public.\nBaylor Evolutionary Informatics Lab controversy.\nSubsequently, in July and August 2007, Dembski played a central role in the formation of the Evolutionary Informatics Lab (EIL), cofounded with Baylor University Engineering Professor Robert J. Marks II. According to Baylor administration, the EIL website hosted at Baylor was deleted because it violated university policy forbidding professors from creating the impression that their personal views represent Baylor as an institution. Dembski says the website was removed because it dealt with intelligent design. Baylor said they would permit Marks to repost his website on their server, provided a 108-word disclaimer accompany any intelligent design-advancing research to make clear that the work does not represent the university's position. The site now resides on a third-party server and still contains the material advancing intelligent design. Dembski's participation was funded by a $30,000 grant from the Lifeworks Foundation, which is controlled by researcher Brendan Dixon of the Biologic Institute (which has close ties to the Discovery Institute).\nSouthwestern Baptist Theological Seminary flood controversy.\nWhile serving as a professor at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, Dembski wrote \"The End of Christianity\", which argued that a Christian can reconcile an old Earth creationist view with a literal reading of Adam and Eve in the Bible by accepting the scientific consensus of a 4.5 billion year of Earth. He further argued that Noah's flood likely was a phenomenon limited to the Middle East. This caused controversy and Dembski's reading of the Bible was criticized by Tom Nettles, a young Earth creationist, in \"The Southern Baptist Journal of Theology\", Southern Seminary's official theological journal. In 2010, the dean of Southwestern's School of Theology, David Allen, \"released a White Paper through the seminary's Center for Theological Research defending Dembski as within the bounds of orthodoxy and critiquing Nettles for misunderstanding the book. The paper included Dembski's statement admitting error regarding Noah's flood.\" Southwestern Seminary president Paige Patterson, a young Earth creationist, \"said that when Dembski's questionable statements came to light, he convened a meeting with Dembski and several high-ranking administrators at the seminary. At that meeting, Dembski was quick to admit that he was wrong about the flood. \"'Had I had any inkling that Dr. Dembski was actually denying the absolute trustworthiness of the Bible, then that would have, of course, ended his relationship with the school,' he said.\"\nPublic advocacy.\nIn December 2001, Dembski launched the International Society for Complexity, Information and Design (ISCID), of which he is Executive Director. Dembski is also the editor-in-chief of ISCID's journal, \"Progress in Complexity, Information, and Design\" (PCID), which appears to have ceased publication with its November 2005 issue. He has several more books in preparation as well as producing an Adobe Flash animation mocking Judge John E. Jones III, who presided in the landmark 2005 \"Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District\" case. He is also a member of American Scientific Affiliation, the Evangelical Philosophical Society, and the American Mathematical Society, and is a senior fellow of the Wilberforce Forum.\nDembski frequently gives public talks, principally to religious, pro-ID groups, and creationists. Barbara Forrest and Paul R. Gross noted that Dembski has not been hesitant in associating with young Earth creationists, such as attending conferences with Carl Baugh.\nDembski, along with fellow Discovery Institute associates Michael Behe and David Berlinski, tutored Ann Coulter on science and evolution for her book \"\" (2006). Approximately one-third of the book is devoted to polemical attacks on evolution, which Coulter, as Dembski often does, terms \"Darwinism.\"\nDembski participated in the documentary film \",\" released in 2008. Dembski told the \"Southern Baptist Texan\" that those who need to see the movie are the \"parents of children in high school or college, as well as those children themselves, who may think that the biological sciences are a dispassionate search for truth about life but many of whose practitioners see biology, especially evolutionary biology, as an ideological weapon to destroy faith in God.\" Dembski has appeared on several television shows, including a 2005 interview with Jon Stewart on \"The Daily Show\" with Edward Larson and Ellie Crystal where he said he accepted religion before science.\nWriting.\nIn 1998, Dembski published his first book, \"The Design Inference: Eliminating Chance through Small Probabilities\", which became a Cambridge University Press bestselling philosophical monograph.\nIn 2002, Dembski published his book \"No Free Lunch: Why Specified Complexity Cannot Be Purchased without Intelligence.\" Dembski's work was strongly criticized within the scientific community, which argued that there were a number of major logical inconsistencies and evidential gaps in Dembski's hypothesis. David Wolpert, co-creator of the No free lunch theorem on which Dembski based his book, characterized his arguments as \"fatally informal and imprecise,\" \"written in jello,\" reminiscent of philosophical discussion \"of art, music, and literature, as well as much of ethics\" rather than of scientific debate.\nMathematician Mark Perakh has stated he believes Dembski overemphasizes his own self-importance in his writing.\nPeer-review controversy.\nOne of the common objections to intelligent design being accepted as valid science is that ID proponents have published no scientific papers in the peer-reviewed scientific literature in support of their conjectures. The ruling in the 2005 Dover trial, \"Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District\", found that intelligent design had not been tested by the process of being published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal and was not supported by any peer-reviewed research, data or publications. Despite the Dover trial ruling, the Discovery Institute lists Dembski's 1998 book \"The Design Inference\" under the heading \"Peer-Reviewed Scientific Books Supportive of Intelligent Design Published by Trade Presses or University Presses.\" The Discovery Institute describes Dembski as a mathematician and philosopher, who includes in his credentials a B.A. in psychology and postdoctoral work in mathematics, physics and computer science.\nIn an expert report, computer scientist and number theorist Jeffrey Shallit states that despite common claims in the popular and religious press, Dembski is not a scientist by any reasonable standard, has not published any experimental or empirical tests of his claims, submitted his claims to the scrutiny of his peers or been published in a scientific journal. In a footnote, Shallit states that he does not consider mathematics to be science. Shallit describes Dembski's published mathematical output as \"extremely small\" for a research mathematician and remarks that \"it is very unlikely that his meagre output would merit tenure at any major university.\"\nSince Shallit's statement, Dembski has (as of May 2010) published four peer-reviewed papers in information theory venues associated with the IEEE professional society. The papers deal with \"active information\" in the context of searches for solutions to problems. Quantified active information is introduced in \"Conservation of Information in Search: Measuring the Cost of Success.\" A second paper, \"Evolutionary Synthesis of Nand Logic: Dissecting a Digital Organism,\" claims to deconstruct the evolution simulation Avida by uncovering the sources of active information in the program. A third paper discusses the role of Jacob Bernoulli's \"principle of indifference\" in the analysis of evolution. The most recent paper, \"Efficient Per Query Information Extraction from a Hamming Oracle,\" calculates the performance of various search algorithms which use the Hamming distance to search for a single string of a certain length in the set of all strings of this length.\nDembski states that his book \"The Design Inference\" has also been peer-reviewed: \"This book was published by Cambridge University Press and peer-reviewed as part of a distinguished monograph series, Cambridge Studies in Probability, Induction, and Decision Theory.\" In his expert report, Shallit states, \"I know that book manuscripts typically do not receive the same sort of scrutiny that research articles do. ...it is not uncommon for a 10-page paper to receive 5 pages or more of comments, whereas a book manuscript of two hundred pages often receives about the same number...\" In addition, Mark Isaak claims that Dembski's book was reviewed by philosophers and not biologists.\n\"The Inner Life of the Cell\" copyright controversy.\nIn November 2007, a graduate student named S. A. Smith brought an apparent case of wholesale academic misuse of unlicensed content to public attention. She noticed that a video used by Dembski in his lecture was identical to \"The Inner Life of the Cell\" animation created by Harvard University and XVIVO Scientific Animation. The audio track giving a scientific explanation was stripped off and the video was used with an alternative narration. The matter was brought to the attention of Harvard and XVIVO. David Bolinsky, creator of the video, wrote that Dembski was warned about using the video without permission.\nIn response to the allegations, Dembski has claimed that he downloaded the video from the Internet, and added a voiceover narration that he deemed appropriate for his audience. According to Dembski, the downloaded version omitted the opening credits but contained the closing credits, which were shown to the audience. However, Smith later documented several instances where images from the Harvard/XVIVO animation were apparently removed from his book \"The Design of Life\" (2008) but the related footnotes and references were not. indicating that Dembski was already aware that permission had been denied for him to use the animation when he delivered his presentation at the University of Oklahoma.\nOn April 9, 2008, \"Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed\", a movie Dembski appears in, was given a cease-and-desist by XVIVO accusing Premise Media, the \"Expelled\" producers, of plagiarism concerning the same video. A June 2008 Premise Media press release announced Premise Media and XVIVO, LLC, \"reached an agreement\" noting \"XVIVO has agreed that the Premise Media documentary does not infringe on any of XVIVO's intellectual property rights.\"\nEvolution.\nDembski's views on evolution have been a source of considerable controversy within both the mainstream scientific and creationist communities. Dembski does not accept universal common descent. His mainstream scientific critics have accused him of dishonesty in his representation of scientific facts and writing, and he has also been criticised by the traditional creationist community for not supporting the young Earth creationist position, though this community does defend some of his other arguments.\nScience vs. naturalism.\nDembski objects to the presence of the theory of evolution in a variety of disciplines, presenting intelligent design as an alternative to reductionist materialism that gives a sense of purpose that the unguided evolutionary process lacks and the ultimate significance of ID is its success in undermining materialism and naturalism. Dembski has also stated that ID has little chance as a serious scientific theory as long as methodological naturalism is the basis for science. Although intelligent design proponents (including Dembski) have made little apparent effort to publish peer-reviewed scientific research to support their hypotheses, in recent years they have made vigorous efforts to promote the teaching of intelligent design in schools. Dembski is a strong supporter of this drive as a means of making young people more receptive to intelligent design, and said he wants \"to see intelligent design flourish as a scientific research program\" among a \"new generation of scholars\" willing to consider the theory and textbooks that include it.\nIntelligent designer.\nDembski's theories do not attempt to explain the origin of the intelligent designer that created the universe, which he argues is unnecessary, since such an intelligent designer is likely outside the dimensions of space and time which are the subject of empirical science.\nHe has not had any of his pro-intelligent-design articles published in peer-reviewed mainstream scientific journals. While intelligent design proponents often allege that such failure to be published is due to a pro-evolution bias or conspiracy, Dembski himself has said he prefers to disseminate his ideas in non-peer-reviewed media: \"I've just gotten kind of blas\u00e9 about submitting things to journals where you often wait two years to get things into print. And I find I can actually get the turnaround faster by writing a book and getting the ideas expressed there. My books sell well. I get a royalty. And the material gets read more.\"\nIn December 2007, Dembski told Focus on the Family that \"The Designer of intelligent\ndesign is, ultimately, the Christian God.\"\nSpecified complexity.\nSpecified complexity is a concept which Dembski has proposed and used in his works promoting intelligent design, an argument intended to give a formal definition of patterns that are both specified and complex. He claims it is a reliable marker of design by an intelligent agent, a central concept of intelligent design, as opposed to natural selection in modern evolutionary theory. The concept of specified complexity is widely regarded as mathematically unsound and has not been the basis for further independent work in information theory, complexity theory, or biology. Specified complexity is one of the two main arguments used by intelligent design proponents, the other being irreducible complexity.\nIntelligent design and Christianity.\nDembski's position on intelligent design's relationship with Christianity has been inconsistent. He has suggested that the \"intelligent designer\" is not necessarily synonymous with a god: \"It could be space aliens. There are many possibilities,\" but has on several occasions been explicit in labelling the designer as the Christian god and linking ID with a religious revival through which Christianity can be restored to its formerly pre-eminent place in society, supplanting \"materialist\" science. In his book \"Intelligent Design: The Bridge Between Science &amp; Theology\" he states \"The conceptual soundings of the [intelligent design] theory can in the end only be located in Christ.\" On his website, DesignInference.com, Dembski said that intelligent design provides an intellectual basis to restore Christian philosophy over materialism.\nDembski has also spoken of his motivation for supporting intelligent design in a series of Sunday lectures in the Fellowship Baptist Church in Waco, Texas, the last of which took place on March 7, 2004. Answering a question, Dembski said it was to enable God to receive credit for creation.\nIntelligent design movement.\nDembski sees intelligent design as being a popular movement as well as a scientific hypothesis and claims that it is in the process of dislodging evolution from the public imagination. At the CSICOP's 4th World Skeptics Conference, held on June 20\u201323, 2002, in Burbank, California, he told the audience that \"over the next twenty-five years ID will provide the greatest challenge to skepticism.\" He asserted that \"ID is threatening to be mainstream,\" and that polls show 90 percent support for the hypothesis, indicating that it has \"already becom[e] mainstream within the public themselves.\" \"The usual skeptical retorts are not going to work against ID\" and ID \"turns the tables on skepticism.\" Evolution, in his view, \"is the ultimate status quo\" and \"squelches dissent.\" Young people, who \"love rebellion\" see that and are attracted to ID as a result. \"The public supports intelligent design. The public is tired of being bullied by an intellectual elite.\" He contends that skeptics resort to rhetoric and \"artificially define ID out of science,\" admitting only materialistic explanations as legitimate. ID \"paints the more appealing world picture,\" whereas skepticism works by being negative, which \"doesn't set well with the public... To most people evolution doesn't provide a compelling view.\"\nBible code.\nDembski has also indicated an interest in the Bible code. In a favorable book review of Jeffrey Satinover's \"Cracking the Bible Code\" (1997), Dembski wrote that \"The philosopher Bertrand Russell was once asked why he didn't believe in God. He replied, 'Not enough evidence.' Satinover's fascination with the Bible Code is that it may provide evidence for God's existence that would have convinced even a Bertrand Russell.\"\nFaith healing.\nDembski once took his family to a meeting conducted by Todd Bentley, a faith healer, in hopes of receiving a \"miraculous healing\" for his son, who is autistic. In an article for the \"Baptist Press\" he recalled disappointment with the nature of the meeting and with the prevention of his son and other attendees from joining those in wheelchairs who were selected to receive prayer. He then concluded, \"Minimal time was given to healing, though plenty was devoted to assaulting our senses with blaring insipid music and even to Bentley promoting and selling his own products (books and CDs).\" He wrote that he did not regret the trip and called it an \"education,\" which showed \"how easily religion can be abused, in this case to exploit our family.\"\nResponses to critics.\nDembski previews material on the Internet for open peer review. This helps identify errors and address objections prior to publication, allowing him to get \"the last word in the exchange.\" Dembski's style in response to his critics (particularly of his mathematical papers) is polemical. For instance, in reply to a critique of the \"law of conservation of information\" posted on talkreason.org, Dembski states: \"I'm not and never have been in the business of offering a strict mathematical proof for the inability of material mechanisms to generate specified complexity in the same way that no physicist is in the business of offering a strict mathematical proof for the conservation of energy.\"\nPublications.\nBooks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSole author\nCo-author\nAs editor or contributor\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nOfficial\nReviews/analysis of Dembski\nBiographical information\nOther"}

Ltd was a Hampshire brewery with a distinctive range of, mainly, bitter beers. Founded in 1847 it was bought by the London brewers, Fuller's of Chiswick in 2005. The brewery was closed in 2006 with production transferred to Chiswick.\nHistory.\nEstablished in 1847 Gales Brewery (George Gale &amp; Co. Ltd) was an old brewery situated in Horndean, on the edge of Waterlooville, near Portsmouth in Hampshire, England. It made the nutty HSB (Horndean Special Bitter) and the newer Gales Bitter. It took its water from its own well situated under the brewery which is fed from the South Downs, and the yeast and 'liquor' (local water used for brewing), coupled with the local brewing style, produced beers with a sparse head, quite dark in colour.\nIn late 2005 Fuller, Smith &amp; Turner bought Gales for \u00a392 million. It raised fears as to the future of Gales Horndean brewery and some of its beers, and the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) launched a campaign to encourage Fuller's to continue production of the full Gales line at Horndean. However, in January 2006, Fuller's began cutting jobs at the Horndean brewery, and it was announced on 27 February 2006 that the brewery would close at the end of March 2006, although distribution and warehousing would continue in the area.\nAt that point, production of the Gales brands moved to Fuller's Griffin Brewery in Chiswick, London, with the exception of Gales Bitter which was discontinued.\nAs of 2017, most of the brewery site has been replaced with apartments and retail shops. The main tower remains standing and was converted alongside the construction of new buildings into apartments.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The five games released between 1998 and 2006 are all set during World War II and follow the adventures of a fictional Allied commando unit. Each mission is loosely based on historical events during World War II to carry the plot. The series was developed by the Spanish developer Pyro Studios and published by Eidos Interactive. The series has sold a total of 3.3 million copies and generated $41 million of revenue at retail.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGames.\n\"Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines\".\n\"Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines\" (CBEL) was released on 1 July 1998. It was published by Eidos Interactive and developed by Pyro Studios. It features 20 missions. The view is isometric with tactical gameplay. A Sega Mega Drive/Genesis version of \"Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines\", with the first 5 missions, was also made by Russian homebrew programmers, but lacked sound and certain other features of the PC version.\n\"Commandos: Beyond the Call of Duty\".\n\"Commandos: Beyond the Call of Duty\", a set of new \"Commandos\" missions issued as a standalone game, was released on 31 March 1999. Despite it being much shorter than \"Behind Enemy Lines\", it is a much more difficult game containing levels on a far greater scale to the extent of being comparable to those that were to be seen in \"Commandos 2\". It has 8 missions, with locations including Yugoslavia and Greece.\n\"Commandos 2: Men of Courage\".\nA full sequel, released in 2001, was rebuilt with a 3D engine, more interactive environments, more skills for the commandos, and new characters. Like its predecessor, it drew heavily from war films and titled its levels in reference to such films as \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\" and \"Saving Private Ryan\". The game received even greater praise.\nSeveral new characters were added to the series in this sequel: a thief called Paul \"Lupin\" Toledo, a dog called Whiskey and \"Wilson\", a shot-down pilot claiming to be from the \"Light Brigade\".\nA remastered version of the game, called \"Commandos 2 - HD Remaster\", was released in 2020.\n\"Commandos 3: Destination Berlin\".\nThis is the third sequel in the series and was released in October 2003. In this game the mouse wheel can be used to rotate the player's vantage point. It was the first in the series to use a true 3D engine, but the game was criticized for its short missions and lack of hotkeys.\nA remastered version of the game, called \"Commandos 3 - HD Remaster\", was released in 2022.\n\"Commandos: Strike Force\".\nReleased during the first months of 2006, this game marks a diversion from the first three games. Although the missions are set up in a similar fashion (several different objectives, some to be achieved through stealth, others through use of force) and in most occasions the player is allowed to change between different characters, this is the first game in the series to apply a first-person perspective, similar to \"Medal of Honor\" or \"Call of Duty\" games than to earlier entries of the series.\n\"Strike Force\" only has three Commandos, making it the game with the least amount of playable characters in the series. They are the Green Beret, The Sniper and The Spy but they are not the same characters from previous instalments; they each bear different appearances, names, and skills.\nThe game attracted an overwhelmingly negative reaction, especially from fans of the earlier games in the series who saw this as a massive modification, concurrent with a great reduction in the series' trademark difficulty. Similarly, it was promoted as mixing elements of strategy from the past games with traditional first-person shooter game-play but instead only hinted at them whilst being predominantly action-oriented. As a result, both critics and fans felt it did little to distance itself from the recent flood of similar games.\n\"Commandos: Origins\".\nA prequel, \"Commandos: Origins\", developed by Claymore Game Studios and published by Kalypso Media, was released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC on April 9, 2025. It serves as a prequel to \"Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines\", and tells the story of the formation of the Commandos team.\nMusic.\nDavid Garcia-Morales In\u00e9s composed the music of the first game and Mateo Pascual that of the next four installments. All five soundtracks are available on iTunes and Amazon.\nRemasters.\nAfter the series was acquired by Kalypso Media, in 2020 and 2022 respectively, they published remastered versions of ' and ' for the Nintendo Switch, Xbox One and PlayStation 4 with adapted controls for the consoles' gamepads.\nMods.\nFollowing the discontinuation of the series by Pyro Studios, a couple of mods have been developed by fans. \"Commandos: Strike in Narrow Path\" is a stand-alone expansion for \"Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines\" containing 9 missions and was released initially in 2010. \"Commandos 2: Destination Paris\" tweaks the gameplay of \"Commandos 2: Men Of Courage\" and adds over 100 missions to the base game.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "43104", "revid": "35936988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43104", "title": "Eldridge Pope", "text": "Brewery in Dorset, UK\nEldridge Pope &amp; Co. was a traditional brewery situated in Dorchester, Dorset. It originated with a brewery in Durngate Street (on the site of the present Waitrose) run by Charles and Sarah Eldridge from 1837; later, the Pope family of Dorset solicitors entered the business, firstly in the form of a partnership, then as a limited company - Eldridge, Pope &amp; Co. Ltd. - incorporated in 1897. A new brewery was meanwhile built closer to the railway line in 1880, and opened in 1881. The brewery closed in July 2003 following its sale to a property company, and now forms part of the Brewery Square development. The pub estate went on to be acquired by Marstons in 2007, whereupon Eldridge Pope became a dormant company. Most of the brewery was demolished in 2020, 140 years after it was built.\nHistory.\nThe origins of Eldridge Pope can be traced back to 1837, when hotel landlord Charles Eldridge and his wife Sarah bought the Green Dragon Brewery in Durngate Street, Dorchester. Together they turned the brewery into a thriving small business, and following Charles's death in 1846, Sarah continued to run it in partnership with local brewer Samuel Mason, under the trading name 'Eldridge, Mason &amp; Co'.\nOn his retirement in 1870, Mason sold his stake in the Brewery to Edwin Pope and his younger sibling Alfred Pope. Sarah Eldridge's son-in-law John Tizard inherited her share of the business, but when he died in 1871 the Popes assumed full control.\nBy 1879 the company had outgrown its Durngate Street premises, and the Pope brothers wanted to build a large new brewery to satisfy their expansion plans for the company. They bought up four acres of land next to the railway line, and commissioned distinguished local architect W. R. Crickmay to design the new structure.\nThe new brewery was officially opened in 1881, and very quickly became the biggest employer in Dorchester. Sixteen years later the Pope brothers incorporated the business as a private limited company under the name 'Eldridge, Pope &amp; Co. Limited'.\nThe following decades saw the next generation of the Pope family take over the running of the company. In 1921 Clement Pope, son of Alfred, created the Huntsman trademark, which became one of the most recognizable and popular brands associated with the company.\nIn 1922 a huge fire ripped through the brewery, damaging much of the brewhouse and several other buildings. It was not until 1925 that the rebuilding work was completed and the brewery was able to produce beer again.\nDenis Edwin Holliday was head brewer at Eldridge Pope throughout the 1960s and 70s. This era was associated with the production of popular real ales such as Royal Oak and Thomas Hardy's Ale. Holliday also had an entry in the \"Guinness Book of Records\", 1978 edition, for brewing the strongest commercially brewed beer.\nIn 1997, the management of the brewery bought the business but not the site. They called their company Thomas Hardy Brewery &amp; Packaging. In 1998, Thomas Hardy acquired another brewery in Burtonwood to form Thomas Hardy Burtonwood.\nIn 2003, Thomas Hardy Burtonwood offered to buy the site from Eldridge Pope for \u00a38m but the offer was declined. Instead, Eldridge Pope sold the site to property company Landworth Properties. Landworth then raised the rent to what the brewery felt to be an uneconomic level causing it to cease its business there with the loss of 57 jobs.\nOne year after the brewery's closure, the family lost control of the business to pubs entrepreneur Michael Cannon who acquired the pubs for \u00a340m plus \u00a342m debt. He identified the need for a three-year, \u00a314m investment programme and a focus on increasing disappointing food sales. He injected his Que Pasa bar chain into the business.\nThe company continued to operate for a further three years under Michael Cannon's management. In January 2007, the assets of Eldridge Pope &amp; Co. Limited were sold to Marstons plc for \u00a3155m. Michael Cannon and his fellow shareholders who included several members of the Pope family made a return of 2.8 times his original investment after turning the business around.\nThe site of the Eldridge Pope brewery was subsequently developed into a shopping and eating complex with restaurants, shops, apartments, a cinema, gym and a hotel.\nCulture.\nIn 1985, the brewery's founder, Sarah Eldridge was the subject of \"Entertaining Strangers: A play for Dorchester\" by the playwright David Edgar and produced as a community play by the people of Dorchester, In 1987 the play was transferred to The National Theatre, with Judi Dench in the role of Sarah Eldridge.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Lasting 88 days, it was the longest battle on German ground during World War II and it is the second longest single battle the U.S. Army has ever fought after the three-month-long Battle of Bataan.\nThe U.S. commanders' initial goal was to pin down German forces in the area to keep them from reinforcing the front lines farther north in the Battle of Aachen, where the US forces were fighting against the Siegfried Line network of fortified industrial towns and villages speckled with pillboxes, tank traps, and minefields. The Americans' initial tactical objectives were to take the village of Schmidt and clear Monschau. In a second phase the Allies wanted to advance to the Rur River as part of Operation Queen.\n\"Generalfeldmarschall\" Walter Model intended to bring the Allied thrust to a standstill. While he interfered less in the day-to-day movements of units than at the Battle of Arnhem, he still kept himself fully informed on the situation, slowing the Allies' progress, inflicting heavy casualties, and taking full advantage of the fortifications the Germans called the \"Westwall\", better known to the Allies as the Siegfried Line. The H\u00fcrtgen Forest cost the U.S. First Army at least 33,000 killed and wounded, including both combat and non-combat losses, with upper estimates at 55,000; German casualties were 28,000. The city of Aachen in the north eventually fell on 22 October at high cost to the U.S. Ninth Army, but they failed to cross the Rur river or wrest control of its dams from the Germans. The battle was so costly that it has been described as an Allied \"defeat of the first magnitude,\" with specific credit given to Model.\nThe Germans fiercely defended the area because it served as a staging area for the 1944 winter offensive \"Wacht am Rhein\" (known in English-speaking countries as the Battle of the Bulge), and because the mountains commanded access to the Rur Dam at the head of the Rur Reservoir (Rurstausee). The Allies failed to capture the area after several heavy setbacks, and the Germans successfully held the region until they launched their last-ditch offensive into the Ardennes. This was launched on 16 December and ended the H\u00fcrtgen offensive. The Battle of the Bulge gained widespread press and public attention, leaving the battle of H\u00fcrtgen Forest less well remembered.\nThe overall cost of the Siegfried Line campaign in American personnel was close to 140,000.\nBackground.\nBy mid-September 1944, the Allied pursuit of the German army after the landings at Normandy was slowing down due to extended supply lines and increasing German resistance. The next strategic objective was to move up to the Rhine River along its entire length and prepare to cross it. Courtney Hodges\u2032 First Army experienced hard resistance pushing through the Aachen Gap and perceived a potential threat from enemy forces using the H\u00fcrtgen Forest as a base.\nThe U.S. 1st Infantry Division arrived in early October, joining elements of the XIX Corps and VII Corps, which had encircled Aachen. Although the 1st Infantry Division called for the surrender of the German garrison in the city, German commander \"Oberst\" Gerhard Wilck refused to capitulate until 21 October.\nThe Allies also thought it was necessary to remove the threat posed by the Rur Dam. The stored water could be released by the Germans, swamping any forces operating downstream. In the view of the American commanders, Omar Bradley, Hodges, and J. Lawton Collins, the direct route to the dam was through the forest.\nSome military historians are no longer convinced by these arguments. Charles B. MacDonald\u2014a U.S. Army historian and former company commander who served in the H\u00fcrtgen battle\u2014has described it as \"...a misconceived and basically fruitless battle that should have been avoided.\"\nGeography.\n \nThe H\u00fcrtgen Forest occupies a rugged area between the Rur River and Aachen. In the autumn and early winter of 1944, the weather was cold, wet, and cloudy, and often prevented air support. Apart from the poor weather, the dense forest and rough terrain also prevented proper use of Allied air superiority, which had great difficulties in spotting any targets. The dense conifer forest is broken by few roads, tracks, and firebreaks; vehicular movement is restricted. Conditions on the ground became a muddy morass, further impeding vehicular traffic, especially heavy vehicles such as tanks.\nThe German defenders had prepared the area with improvised blockhouses, minefields, barbed wire, and booby-traps, hidden by the mud and snow. There were also numerous concrete bunkers in the area, mostly belonging to the deep defenses of the Siegfried Line, which were also centers of resistance. The dense forest allowed infiltration and flanking attacks, and it was sometimes difficult to establish a front line or to be confident that an area had been cleared of the enemy. The small numbers of routes and clearings in the forest had also allowed German machine gun, mortar, and artillery teams to pre-range their weapons and fire accurately.\nThe American advantage in numbers (as high as 5:1), armor, mobility, and air support was thus greatly reduced by weather and terrain. In the forest, relatively small numbers of determined and prepared defenders could be highly effective. To exacerbate matters, as the American divisions took casualties, inexperienced replacements had to be fed directly into combat.\nThe densely forested terrain also limited the use of tanks and provided cover for German anti-tank teams equipped with \"Panzerfaust\" shaped-charge grenade launchers. The Allies made improvised rocket launchers, using rocket tubes from aircraft and spare Jeep trailers. Later in the battle, it proved necessary to blast tank routes through the forest. Transportation was similarly limited by the lack of routes: at critical times, it proved difficult to reinforce or supply front-line units or to evacuate the dead and wounded.\nThe Germans were hampered by much the same difficulties, worsened because their divisions had already taken heavy losses on the retreat through France and were hastily filled up with untrained boys and old men, often unfit for normal military service. Transportation was also a problem, because of the difficult roads and the lack of trucks and fuel; most supplies had to be manhandled to the front line. Nonetheless, despite increasing numbers of replacements lacking experience, German defenders had the advantage in that their commanders and many of their soldiers had been fighting for years and had learned the necessary tactics for fighting efficiently in winter and forested areas, whereas the Americans were often well-trained but inexperienced.\nOpposing armies.\nThe H\u00fcrtgen Forest lay within the area of the U.S. First Army under Hodges. Responsibility fluctuated between the V Corps and VII Corps.\nAt the start, the forest was defended by the German 275th and 353rd Infantry Divisions; understrength but well prepared\u20145,000 men (1,000 in reserve)\u2014and commanded by \"Generalleutnant\" Hans Schmidt. They had little artillery and no tanks. As the battle progressed, German reinforcements were added. American expectations that these troops were weak and ready to withdraw were overly optimistic.\nBattle.\nFirst phase.\nThe 9th Infantry Division's ultimate objective were the Rur River crossings at D\u00fcren. On September 16, 1944, an attack by the 47th Infantry Regiment captured Schevenh\u00fctte, on the northern fringes of the forest, with few casualties. The division had surprised the Germans, but lacked the strength to push on as two of their regiments were committed to the south. Attacks on and around the H\u00f6fen-Alzen ridge by the 39th and 60th Infantry Regiments were met with heavy resistance and pushed back. The 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 39th captured Lammersdorf, but could not dislodge enemies entrenched in the woods behind the village; the 3rd Battalion suffered heavy losses attacking Hill 554, near Lammersdorf. In these early engagements, the 9th Infantry Division was unable to eject the Germans from the periphery of the forest, and decided to push through it to the northeast and capture H\u00fcrtgen and Kleinhau. The engagement began on September 19, 1944. Repeated probes entered the forest toward their objective, but were beaten back by the terrain and Germans dug into prepared positions. On October 5, the 39th and 60th Infantry Regiments attacked towards the town of Schmidt while the 47th held a defensive position. The Monschau-D\u00fcren road was quickly cut, but both regiments were slowed by defenses and suffered significant casualties: The 60th's 2nd Battalion was reduced to a third after the first day. The 39th was halted at the Weisser Weh Creek; there were problems with narrow paths, air bursts in trees, and fire breaks which were blocked or enfiladed. Evacuation and supply was difficult or impossible. By 16 October, had been gained at the cost of 4,500 casualties. The U.S. 28th Infantry Division\u2014a Pennsylvania National Guard unit\u2014arrived the same day to relieve the battered 9th. Cota established his division command post in the village of Rott on 25 October and began coordination with the V Corps staff for future operations as his units began to occupy the 9th's positions north of Lammersdorf.\nWhen Cota received the operations order for the attack he was perplexed and none too happy. It was far too directive and detailed and left little for him, his staff and his regimental commanders to do except execute it. It was basically the same plan that had been given to the 9th Infantry Division and that plan had failed. Hodges dictated that the 28th was to capture Vossenack and the treeline facing the village of Huertgen. Gerow directed that an entire regiment would assault Huertgen to the north; a second regiment would attack and capture Schmidt in the center and a third regiment attack south towards Raffelsbrand. The 28th Division was reinforced with the attached 707th Tank Battalion, tracked M29 Weasel transport and air support. Of its three regiments, one was deployed to protect the northern flank, another to attack Germeter, and the third to capture Schmidt, the main objective. The area had terrible terrain with the Kall Trail running along a deep river ravine. The terrain was not suited to tanks, despite the need for armor to support the infantry.\n\"It was during the final days of preparation before the attack that Cota made three crucial mistakes that would have far reaching effects on his division's assault into the Huertgen. The first was that neither he nor his staff directed subordinate units to conduct patrolling into the Huertgen Forest [...]; the second mistake was tied to the first. Cota had approved the extremely narrow Kall trail to serve as the division's main supply route [...]. Aerial reconnaissance could not confirm the trail's condition due to the dense forest covering it but ground patrols would have provided much valuable information, both about the enemy and the trail. The third mistake was his decision not to use armor to support his infantry. Believing that the forest would not allow access and the required road network to support tanks, he kept all but two of his tank companies and all of his tank destroyer units in the rear to augment his division artillery. Had he discussed this with the commander of 9th Infantry Division, he would have learned that tanks could operate in many areas of the forest and with some training and prior coordination they could provide valuable support to the infantry.\"\nThe attack by the 28th Division started on 2 November; the defenders were expecting it and were ready. The U.S. 109th Infantry Regiment, assigned to capture the woods north of Germeter, was impeded after by an unexpected minefield (the \"Wild Pig\"), pinned down by mortar and artillery fire and harassed by local counterattacks. Just was gained after two days, after which the 109th dug in and endured casualties. This initial attack was nearly all the ground the 109th would take during the battle. The U.S. 110th Infantry Regiment had to clear the woods next to the Kall River, capture Simonskall, and maintain a supply route for the advance on Schmidt: Again, these were very difficult tasks due to weather, prepared defenses, determined defenders, and terrain. The weather prevented tactical air support until 5 November.\nThe U.S. 112th Infantry Regiment, attacking from Germeter, took Vossenack and the neighboring ridge by the afternoon. The 112th was then halted by strong defenses and difficult terrain. The 1st and 3rd Battalions of the 112th moved across the Kall Valley and captured Kommerscheidt and Schmidt, respectively, on 3 November. The German supply route to Monschau was cut, but American supply, reinforcement, and evacuation were very limited as the Kall Trail had poor terrain and was infiltrated by the Germans. At dawn on November 4, a strong German counter-attack by tanks of the 116th Panzer Division and a chance encirclement by troops from the 89th Infantry Division rapidly expelled the 3rd Battalion from Schmidt, and they were unable to counter-attack. The battalion disintegrated after constant shelling and a fierce attack by the 116th Panzer Division and some men inadvertently fled east, to be captured by the Germans. The rest of the battalion retreated to Kommerscheidt to join the 112th's 1st Battalion. Realizing the gravity of the situation, eight M4 Shermans of Company A, 707th Tank Battalion attempted to cross the Kall Valley, but only three actually made it across to support the beleaguered 112th. The 116th Panzer Division again attacked with tanks and infantry several times. The American tanks, along with infantry and air support, destroyed five German Panzer IV tanks. At Vossenack, the 112th's 2nd Battalion was nearly forced out of the town on November 6 by a fierce German counterattack, but were assisted by engineers in retaking the western part of the town. The Americans across the Kall Valley at Kommerscheidt held on until November 8, when an order to withdraw was given. The positions at Schmidt and the Kall Trail were abandoned. It wasn't until February 1945 that the 82nd Airborne Division permanently captured the Kall Trail and Schmidt.\nA German regimental doctor, \"Hauptmann\" , negotiated an unofficial ceasefire with the Americans at the Kall Bridge from 7\u201312 November, in order to attend to the wounded of both sides, numbering in the thousands. The lives of many American soldiers were saved by German medics.\nSecond phase.\nThe second phase was part of Operation Queen, the Allied thrust to the Rur River. In this phase, the U.S. 4th Infantry Division was to clear the northern half of the forest between Schevenh\u00fctte and H\u00fcrtgen, capture H\u00fcrtgen, and advance to the Rur south of D\u00fcren. From 10 November, this would be VII Corps\u2032 responsibility and it was part of the main VII Corps effort to reach the Rur. The 4th Division was now fully committed to the H\u00fcrtgen, although its 12th Infantry Regiment was already mauled from its action at Schmidt, leaving just two fully effective regiments to achieve the divisional objectives. U.S. VII Corps was opposed by German forces, mainly from the LXXXI Corps, consisting of three understrength divisions. In the H\u00fcrtgen, there was the 275th Infantry Division\u20146,500 men with 150 artillery pieces. They were well dug-in and prepared.\nThe abstract of a U.S. report describes what happened:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The VII (U.S.) Corps, First Army attacked 16 November 1944, with 1st Inf Div, 4th Inf Div, 104th Inf Div, and CCR 5th AD to clear Huertgen Forest and the path of First Army to the Rur River. After heavy fighting, primarily by the 4th Infantry Division, VII Corps' attack ground to a halt. V Corps was committed on 21 November 1944. Attacking with 8th Inf Div, and CCR 5th AD, the V Corps managed to capture Huertgen after stiff fighting on 28 November 1944.\nThe attack started on 16 November. The two infantry regiments attacked in parallel columns: the 8th along the northern edge of the forest towards D\u00fcren, the 22nd further south in parallel. The open flanks invited infiltration. Similar tactics elsewhere in H\u00fcrtgen had \"invited disaster\".\nAttacks by the 8th Infantry Regiment on Rother Weh Creek hit heavy resistance and were repulsed with heavy losses. The 22nd failed to take Raven's Hedge (\"Rabenheck\"), beaten back by heavy machine-gun and artillery fire along the fire-breaks. After three days, there were 300 casualties, including numerous officers and NCOs.\nBy 18 November, tanks were deemed essential, so engineers blasted tank routes through the forest. Communications and logistics remained a problem, so the next day the attack paused to allow re-supply and evacuation of the wounded. German reinforcements arrived from 344th and 353rd Infantry Divisions and resistance stiffened further.\nResponsibility was returned to V Corps and, on 21 November, 8th Division attacked the Weisser Weh Valley, continuing toward H\u00fcrtgen. The 121st Infantry Regiment hit heavy defenses immediately. Despite armored support from the 10th Tank Battalion, daily advances were less than . H\u00fcrtgen was taken on 29 November and the battle continued to Kleinhau, north.\nThe final action in the H\u00fcrtgen Forest was at Langerwehe-Merode, on the northeastern edge of the forest. Two American companies took the village, but they were later destroyed in a German counter-attack. More than 300 soldiers of the 1st Infantry Division were killed in action on November 29 and 30, 1944.\nLater, the secret daily report of the Supreme High Command of the German Army (\"Oberkommando des Heeres\" (OKH)) of 27 November, stated that in the old Langerwehe penetration area, the U.S. Army (\"enemy\") won terrain.\nElements of the 8th and the 28th Infantry Divisions then advanced on Brandenberg. The 28th Division\u2014just like the 9th before it (and the 4th Infantry Division, which would relieve the 28th)\u2014also took heavy casualties during its stay in the H\u00fcrtgen Forest. On 14 November, the 2nd Ranger Battalion arrived to relieve elements of the 112th Infantry Regiment. On 6 December, the Rangers moved on Bergstein and subsequently took the strategic position of Hill 400 from defending troops from 980th Grenadier Regiment of the 272nd Volksgrenadier Division. Shortly thereafter, on 12 December, the towns of Gey and Strass were taken by American Forces. On the last day of the H\u00fcrtgen battle the Germans retook the hill from the 13th Regiment who had replaced the Rangers. The U.S. Army would not seize Hill 400 again until February 1945.\nFrom 1\u201312 December, the 309th, 310th and 311th Infantry Regiments of the 78th Infantry Division (\"Lightning\") relieved elements of the 1st Infantry Division in the line in the vicinity of Entenpfuhl. On 13 December, these regiments smashed into Simmerath, Witzerath, and Bikerath, Germany, and were fighting the Battle of Kesternich against the 272nd Volksgrenadier Division when General Gerd von Rundstedt launched his counteroffensive in the Monschau area. On December 15 the 2nd battalion, 309th Infantry was annihilated when the 272nd Volksgrenadiers counterattacked and took back Kesternich. The Germans knew that from the heights at Kesternich the Americans could detect the troop buildup for the Ardennes Offensive and place artillery there to fire on advancing German troops.\nMilitary actions at the Siegfried Line up to 15 December alone brought death, injury or captivity to more than 250,000 soldiers from both sides. The First and Ninth U.S. Army suffered 57,039 battle casualties (dead, wounded, captured, missing in action); 71,654 non-battle casualties, i.e. accidents, diseases such as pneumonia, trench foot, frostbite, and trauma. German Armed Forces are presumed to be 12,000 dead, 95,000 captured (documented), and an unknown number of wounded.\nOn 16 December 1944, German forces began the Ardennes Offensive, more commonly known as the Battle of the Bulge and as a result further fighting in the H\u00fcrtgen ended.\nAftermath.\nThe Battle of H\u00fcrtgen Forest has been referred to as a stalemate that consumed large amounts of resources on both sides. The Americans suffered 33,000 casualties during the course of the battle which ranged up to 55,000 casualties, included 9,000 non-combat losses and represented a 25 percent casualty rate. The Germans had also suffered heavy losses with 28,000 casualties\u2014many of these were non-combatants and prisoners of war.\nThe surprise German Ardennes offensive caught Allied forces off guard. The Germans attacked with nearly 30 divisions; including the elite 1st SS, 2nd SS, and the 12th SS Panzer Divisions, with the northernmost point of the battlefront centered on Monschau. They forced a large salient in the American lines almost deep at its maximum extent. However, the Germans never came close to their primary objective, the capture of Antwerp. The Ardennes Offensive came to a complete halt in early January, when German forces in the northern shoulder of the bulge were blocked by a strong American defence, the destruction of bridges by American engineers, and a lack of fuel.\nIn early February, American forces attacked through the H\u00fcrtgen Forest for the final time. On 10 February 1945, the Rur Dam was taken by American forces and the forest itself was not cleared until the 17th when the 82nd Airborne Division reached the Roer river.\nLegacy.\nThere is a stone monument with a bronze plaque at the H\u00fcrtgen Military Cemetery, dedicated by veterans of the U.S. 4th Infantry Division to the memory of Friedrich Lengfeld (29 September 1921 \u2013 12 November 1944), a German lieutenant. Lengfeld died on 12 November 1944, of severe wounds sustained while helping a wounded American soldier out of the \"Wild Sow\" (\"Wilde Sau\") minefield. It is the only such memorial for a German soldier placed by his erstwhile opponents in a German military cemetery.\nA memorial sculpture on Kall Bridge recalls that moment of humanity amidst the horrors of war. It was officially dedicated on the 60th anniversary of the ceasefire on the Kall Bridge, November 7, 2004. It was created by Michael Pohlmann, who commented:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I didn't want to create a monument to heroes, no theatrical representation, no pathos, but wanted to appear more unassumingly with a frugal shape, hewn in stone, dignifying the actual place of the incident. A place perhaps, at which once everything may have started rationally, then however, became more and more irrational and totally out of control until a return to sanity\u2014or was it still emotion?\u2014made a humanitarian encounter come true.\nThe plaque was created by the sculptor Tilman Schmitten, Eupen. The memorial sculpture and plaque were endowed by the Konejung Foundation: Culture\nThe 1944 H\u00fcrtgen Forest Museum was opened on 29 March 1983 in Kleinhau, in a stone barn to commemorate the battle.\nHistorical analysis.\nHistorical discussion revolves around whether or not the American battle plan made any operational or tactical sense. One analysis is that the Allies under-estimated the strength and determination remaining in the psyche of the German soldier, believing his fighting spirit had collapsed under the stress of the Normandy breakout and the reduction of the Falaise pocket.\nTrigg describes the battle as one of the \"most ill-conceived and unnecessary offensives of the whole northwest Europe campaign\" and said that Hodges \"lacked tactical imagination\" and that \"it was a miracle that he retained Eisenhower's confidence\".\nAmerican commanders, in particular, misunderstood the impassability of the dense H\u00fcrtgen Forest, and its effects of reducing artillery effectiveness and making air or armoured support impracticable. The better alternative\u2014breaking through south-east out into the open valley, where their advantages in mobility and airpower could come into play, and then heading northeast towards the actual objectives\u2014seems not to have been really considered by the higher headquarters.\nIn addition, American forces were concentrated in the village of Schmidt, and neither tried to conquer the strategic Rur Dams nor recognized the importance of Hill 400 until an advanced stage of the battle.\nWorld War Two lieutenant and History professor and academician Paul Fussell blames the impracticality of Lieutenant General Courtney H. Hodges' command and untrained troops' demoralization for the defeat in the battle, citing the violation of Patton's observation that \"Plans should be made by those who are going to execute them.\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "43109", "revid": "4842600", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43109", "title": "Sinhala script", "text": "Abugida writing system\nThe Sinhalese script (), also known as Sinhala script, is a writing system used by the Sinhalese people and most Sri Lankans in Sri Lanka and elsewhere to write the Sinhalese language as well as the liturgical languages Pali and Sanskrit. The Sinhalese Ak\u1e63ara M\u0101l\u0101va, one of the Brahmic scripts, is a descendant of the Ancient Indian Brahmi script. It is thought to be derived from Grantha script.\nHistory.\nThe Sinhala script is a Brahmi derivate and was thought to have been imported from Northern India around the 3rd century BCE. It developed in a complex manner, partly independently but also strongly influenced by South Indian scripts at various stages, manifestly influenced by the early Grantha script. Pottery from the 6th century BCE has been found in Anuradhapura with lithic Brahmi inscriptions written in Helu Prakrit. It has caused debate as to whether Ceylonese Brahmi influenced Brahmi in the Indian mainland.\nMedieval Sinhalese, which emerged around 750 AD, which is thought to be derived from Grantha script. Although, it has to be noted that between the Proto-Sinhalese and the Medieval Sinhalese that the found inscriptions are radically different, thus, it looks like a break. However, according to the author Diringer a new script which has been derived from the Grantha script \"was also later employed for official inscriptions\". Subsequently, Medieval (and modern) Sinhalese resemble the South Indian scripts. The earliest surviving literature is from the 9th century CE, by this time around the script became more prevalent and was used in other contexts as well. For instance, the Buddhist literature of the Theravada-Buddhists of Sri Lanka, written in Pali, used Sinhala script.\nModern Sinhalese emerged in the 13th century and is marked by the composition of the grammar book \"Sidat Sangara\". In 1736, the Dutch were the first to print with Sinhala type on the island. The resulting type followed the features of the native Sinhala script used on palm leaves. The type created by the Dutch was monolinear and geometric in fashion, with no separation between words in early documents. During the second half of the 19th century, during the colonial period, a new style of Sinhala letterforms emerged in opposition to the monolinear and geometric form that used high contrast and had varied thicknesses. This high contrast type gradually replaced the monolinear type as the preferred style and continues to be used in the present day. The high contrast style is still preferred for text typesetting in printed newspapers, books, and magazines in Sri Lanka.\nToday, the alphabet is used by over 16 million people to write Sinhala in very diverse contexts, such as newspapers, TV commercials, government announcements, graffiti, and schoolbooks.\nSinhala is the main language written in this script, but rare instances of its use for writing Sri Lanka Malay have been recorded.\nStructure.\nSinhala script is an abugida written from left to right. It uses consonants as the basic unit for word construction as each consonant has an inherent vowel (), which can be changed with a different vowel stroke. To represent different sounds it is necessary to add vowel strokes, or diacritics called (Pili), that can be used before, after, above, or below the base-consonant. Most of the Sinhala letters are curlicues; straight lines are almost completely absent from the alphabet, and it does not have joining characters. This is because Sinhala used to be written on dried palm leaves, which would split along the veins on writing straight lines. This was undesirable, and therefore, the round shapes were preferred. Upper and lower cases do not exist in Sinhala.\nSinhala letters are ordered into two sets. The core set of letters forms the pure Sinhala ( alphabet, which is a subset of the mixed Sinhala ( alphabet). The definition of the two sets is thus a historic one. The \u015buddha alphabet, also called the E\u1e37u alphabet (), contains everything necessary to write E\u1e37u, or classical Sinhala, as described in the classical grammar Sidatsan\u0306gar\u0101 (1300 AD). The \u015buddha alphabet is also a good representation of the phoneme inventory of present-day colloquial Sinhala; all native sounds of the Modern Sinhala can be represented by \"\". The \"\u015buddha\" also includes the letters and diacritics for the retroflex consonants \u27e8\u1e37\u27e9 and \u27e8\u1e47\u27e9, which are not phonemic in modern Sinhala but are needed for the representation of E\u1e37u. However, words which historically contained these two phonemes are still often written with these letters, despite changes in pronunciation.\nThe alphabet includes letters for Middle Indic aspirate, retroflex and sibilant consonants which are not found in modern Sinhala, but are used in the transcription of are used for transcribing loanwords from Sanskrit (tatsama), Pali or English. Although modern Sinhala sounds are not aspirated, aspiration is marked in the sound where it was historically present, to highlight the differences in modern spelling. The use of letters is mainly a question of prestige. From a purely phonemic point of view, their sounds can all be represented by \"\u015buddha\" letters.\nAlthough most phonemes of Sinhala can be represented by a \"\u015buddha\" letter or by a \"mi\u015bra\" letter, normally only one of them is considered correct. Additionally, the \"\u015buddha\" set itself contains both \u27e8\u1e37\u27e9 and \u27e8l\u27e9, as well as \u27e8\u1e47\u27e9 and \u27e8n\u27e9, and neither pair is distinctive in Modern sinhala. This one-to-many mapping of phonemes onto graphemes is a frequent source of misspellings.\nWhile a phoneme can be represented by more than one grapheme, each grapheme can be pronounced in only one way, with the exceptions of the inherent vowel sound, which can be either (stressed) or (unstressed), and \"\u0dc0\" where the consonant is either or depending on the word. This means that the actual pronunciation of a word is almost always clear from its spelling. Stress is almost always predictable; only words with or (which are both allophones of \"\u0dc0\"), and a very few other words need to be learnt individually.\nConsonants.\nThe alphabet includes eight plosives, two fricatives, two affricates, two nasals, two liquids and two glides. As in other Brahmic scripts, each consonant carries an inherent vowel, which in Sinhala is .\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPrenasalization.\nThe prenasalized consonants resemble their plain counterparts. \u27e8\u0db9\u27e9, \"m\u0306ba\" is made up of the left half of \u27e8\u0db8\u27e9 \"ma\" and the right half of \u27e8\u0db6\u27e9 \"ba\", while the other three are just like the grapheme for the plosive with a little stroke added. Vowel diacritics attach to a prenasalised consonant in the same way as they would to the corresponding plain plosives.\nConsonant conjuncts.\nCertain combinations of letters are written with ligatures. Some graphical conventions include a \u27e8\u0dbb\u27e9 \"ra\" following a consonant represented by and inverted arch \u27e8\u25cc\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u27e9 (rak\u0101ransaya), a \u27e8\u0dbb\u27e9 \"r\" preceding a consonant by a loop above \u27e8\u0dbb\u0dca\u200d\u25cc\u27e9 (r\u0113paya), and a \u27e8\u0dba\u27e9, \"ya\" following a consonant as a half of a \"ya\" \u27e8\u0dca\u200d\u0dba\u27e9 on the right (yansaya). Some very frequent combinations can be written in one stroke, like \u27e8\u0daf\u0dca\u200d\u0db0\u27e9, \"ddha\", \u27e8\u0d9a\u0dca\u200d\u0dc0\u27e9, \"kwa\" or \u27e8\u0d9a\u0dca\u200d\u0dc2\u27e9, \"k\u015b\".\nTouching letters were used in ancient scriptures but are not used in modern Sinhala. Vowels may be attached to any of the ligatures formed, attaching to the rightmost part of the glyph except for vowels that use the \"kombuva\", where the \"kombuva\" is written before the ligature or cluster and the remainder of the vowel, if any, is attached to the rightmost part.\nVowels and diacritics.\nEach vowel has two forms, an independent and a diacritic or vowel stroke (). The independent form is used when a vowel occurs at the beginning of a word. The diacritic is used when a vowel follows a consonant.\nWhile most diacritics are regular, \u27e8\u0dd4\u27e9, \"u\" and \u27e8\u0dd6\u27e9 \"\u016b\" take on a different shape when attached to a \u27e8\u0d9a\u27e9, \"ka\", \u27e8\u0d9c\u27e9, \"ga\", \u27e8\u0d9f\u27e9, \"n\u0306ga\", \u27e8\u0dad\u27e9, \"ta\", \u27e8\u0db7\u27e9, \"bha\", or \u27e8\u0dc1\u27e9, \"\u015ba\". E.g.: \u27e8\u0d9a\u0dd4\u27e9, \"ku\", \u27e8\u0d9a\u0dd6\u27e9, \"k\u016b\".\nThe inherent vowel of a letter can be removed by a hal kir\u012bma (\u25cc\u0dca), which has two shapes depending on which consonant it attaches to.\nCombinations of \u0dbb(r) or \u0dc5(\u1e37) with \u27e8u\u27e9 have idiosyncratic shapes, viz \u0dbb\u0dd4 (ru), \u0dbb\u0dd6 (r\u016b), \u0dc5\u0dd4 (\u1e37u) and \u0dc5\u0dd6 (\u1e37\u016b). The diacritic used for \u0dbb\u0dd4 (ru) and \u0dbb\u0dd6 (r\u016b) is what is normally used for the \u27e8\u00e6\u27e9, and therefore there are idiosyncratic forms for \"r\u00e6\" and \"r\u01e3\", viz \u0dbb\u0dd0 and \u0dbb\u0dd1.\n\u015auddha vowels.\nThere are six long and six short \"\u015buddha\" vowels.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMi\u015bra vowels and vocalics.\nThere are six additional vowel and syllabic consonants in the \"mi\u015bra\" alphabet. The two diphthongs are quite common, while the vocalic \u1e5b is much rarer, and \u1e37 is all but obsolete. The latter two are almost exclusively found in loanwords from Sanskrit.\nThe \"mi\u015bra\" \u27e8\u1e5b\u27e9 can also be written with \"\u015buddha\" \u27e8r\u27e9+\u27e8u\u27e9 or \u27e8u\u27e9+\u27e8r\u27e9, which corresponds to the actual pronunciation. The \"mi\u015bra\" syllabic \u1e37 can be replaced by \"\u015buddha\" \u27e8l\u27e9+\u27e8i\u27e9. Mi\u015bra \u27e8au\u27e9 is rendered as \"\u015buddha\" \u27e8awu\u27e9, \"mi\u015bra\" \u27e8ai\u27e9 as \"\u015buddha\" \u27e8ayi\u27e9.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOther diacritics.\nThe anusvara (often called \"binduva\" 'zero') is represented by one small circle \u27e8\u25cc\u0d82\u27e9, and the visarga (technically part of the \"mi\u015bra\" alphabet) by two \u27e8\u25cc\u0d83\u27e9.\nLetter names.\nThe Sinhala \"\u015buddha\" graphemes are named in a uniform way adding \"-yanna\" to the sound produced by the letter, including vocalic diacritics. The name for the letter \u0d85 is thus \"ayanna\", for the letter \u0d86 \"\u0101yanna\", for the letter \u0d9a \"kayanna\", for the letter \u0d9a\u0dcf \"k\u0101yanna\", for the letter \u0d9a\u0dd9 \"keyanna\" and so forth. For letters with \"hal kir\u012bma\", an epenthetic \"a\" is added for easier pronunciation: the name for the letter \u0d9a\u0dca is \"akyanna\". Another naming convention is to use \"al-\" before a letter with suppressed vowel, thus \"alkayanna\".\nSince the extra \"mi\u015bra\" letters are phonetically not distinguishable from the \"\u015buddha\" letters, proceeding in the same way would lead to confusion. Names of \"mi\u015bra\" letters are normally made up of the names of two \"\u015buddha\" letters pronounced as one word. The first one indicates the sound, the second one the shape. For example, the aspirated \u0d9b (kh) is called \"bayanu kayanna\". \"kayanna\" indicates the sound, while \"bayanu\" indicates the shape: \u0d9b (kh) is similar in shape to \u0db6 (b) (\"bayunu = like bayanna\"). Another method is to qualify the \"mi\u015bra\" aspirates by \"mah\u0101pr\u0101na\" (\u0d9b: \"mah\u0101pr\u0101na kayanna\") and the \"mi\u015bra\" retroflexes by \"m\u016brdhaja\" (\u0dc5: \"m\u016brdhaja layanna\").\nNumerals.\nSinhala had its numerals (), which were used from prior to the fall of Kandyan Kingdom in 1815. They can be seen primarily in Royal documents and artefacts. Sinhala Illakkam did not have a zero, but did have signs for 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 1000.\nThis system has been replaced by the Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system.\nAstrological numbers.\nPrior to the fall of Kandyan Kingdom all calculations were carried out using . After that event, Sinhala lith illakkam became known as or Sinhala astrological number and were primarily used for writing horoscopes. The tradition of writing degrees and minutes of zodiac signs in lith numbers continued into the 20th century. Unlike the Sinhala illakkam, Sinhala lith illakkam included a 0.\nNeither the Sinhala numerals nor the Sinhala punctuation mark \"kunddaliya\" is in general use today, but some use it in social media, Internet messaging and blogs. The kunddaliya was formerly used as a full stop.\nTransliteration.\nSinhala transliteration (Sinhala: \u0dbb\u0ddd\u0db8 \u0d85\u0d9a\u0dd4\u0dbb\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca \u0dbd\u0dd2\u0dc0\u0dd3\u0db8 \"r\u014dma akurin liw\u012bma\", literally \"Roman letter writing\") can be done in analogy to Devan\u0101gar\u012b transliteration.\nLayman's transliterations in Sri Lanka normally follow neither of these. Vowels are transliterated according to English spelling equivalences, which can yield a variety of spellings for a number of phonemes. for instance can be \u27e8ee\u27e9, \u27e8e\u27e9, \u27e8ea\u27e9, \u27e8i\u27e9, etc.\nA transliteration pattern peculiar to Sinhala, and facilitated by the absence of phonemic aspirates, is the use of \u27e8th\u27e9 for the voiceless dental plosive, and the use of \u27e8t\u27e9 for the voiceless retroflex plosive.\nThis is presumably because the retroflex plosive is perceived the same as the English alveolar plosive , and the Sinhala dental plosive is equated with the English voiceless dental fricative . Dental and retroflex voiced plosives are always rendered as \u27e8d\u27e9, though, presumably because \u27e8dh\u27e9 is not found as a representation of in English orthography.\nUse for the Pali language.\nMany of the oldest Pali manuscript are written in the Sinhala script. The first instance of the Pali Tripitaka being written down sometime from 29 to 17 BCE occurred in Sri Lanka. At the time, these would have been written in what was still Brahmi script but adapted to palm leaves. Successive copies of Buddhist texts follow the evolution of that version of Brahmi on the island, leading to modern Sinhala.\nMany of the consonants are used to represent Pali phonemes that have no Sinhala counterpart, particularly the aspirated consonants. On the other hand, not all set consonants are used; the prenasalised consonants have no counterpart in Pali phonology, and so are not used. Consonant sequences may be combined in ligatures the same way as in Sinhala.\nThe vowels are a subset of those for writing Sinhala, comprising long and short \"a\", \"i\", and \"u\", short \"e\" and short \"o\".\nThe is represented with the sign \u0d82.\nAs an example, below is the first verse from the Pali Dhammapada in Sinhala script, along with the corresponding romanization.\n \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2014\u200a\nRelation to other scripts.\nSinhala is one of the Brahmic scripts, and thus shares many similarities with other members of the family, such as Grantha, Kannada, Malayalam, Telugu, Tamil script and Devan\u0101gar\u012b. As a general example, is the inherent vowel in all these scripts (except Devanagari, where it is /\u0259/). Other similarities include the diacritic for \u27e8ai\u27e9, which resembles a doubled \u27e8e\u27e9 in all scripts and the diacritic for \u27e8au\u27e9 which is composed of preceding \u27e8e\u27e9 and following \u27e8\u1e37\u27e9.\nLikewise, the combination of the diacritics for \u27e8e\u27e9 and \u27e8\u0101\u27e9 yields \u27e8o\u27e9 in all these scripts.\nSinhala alphabet differs from other Indo-Aryan alphabets in that it contains a pair of vowel sounds (U+0DD0 and U+0DD1 in the proposed Unicode Standard) that are unique to it. These are the two vowel sounds that are similar to the two vowel sounds that occur at the beginning of the English words \"at\" (\u0d87) and \"ant\" (\u0d88).\nComputer encoding.\nGenerally speaking, Sinhala support is less developed than support for Devan\u0101gar\u012b, for instance. A recurring problem is the rendering of diacritics which precede the consonant and diacritic signs which come in different shapes, like the one for \u27e8u\u27e9.\nSinhala support did not come built in with Microsoft Windows XP, unlike Tamil and Hindi, but was supported by third-party means such as Keyman by SIL International. Thereafter, all versions of Windows Vista and above, including Windows 10 come with Sinhala support by default, and do not require external fonts to be installed to read Sinhala script. \"Nirmala UI\" is the default Sinhala font in Windows 10. The latest versions of Windows 10 have added support for Sinhala Archaic Numbers that were not supported by default in previous versions.\nFor macOS, Apple Inc. has provided Sinhala font support for versions of macOS that are Catalina and above through Unicode integration. Keyboard support is available by third-party means such as Helakuru and https://. In Mac OS X, Sinhala font and keyboard support were provided by https:// and https://.\nFor Linux, the IBus, and SCIM input methods allow the use Sinhala script in applications with support for a number of key maps and techniques such as traditional, phonetic and assisted techniques. In addition, newer versions of the Android mobile operating system also support both rendering and input of Sinhala script by default and applications like Helakuru serve as dedicated keyboard integrators.\nUnicode.\nSinhala script was added to the Unicode Standard in September 1999 with the release of version 3.0.\nThis character allocation has been adopted in Sri Lanka as the Standard SLS1134.\nThe main Unicode block for Sinhala is U+0D80\u2013U+0DFF. Another block, Sinhala Archaic Numbers, was added to Unicode in version 7.0.0 in June 2014. Its range is U+111E0\u2013U+111FF.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She grew up in a family of performing artists, the daughter of country music singer Naomi Judd and the half-sister of country music singer Wynonna Judd. Her acting career has spanned more than three decades, and she has become heavily involved in global humanitarian efforts and political activism. Judd made her television debut in 1991 with a guest role on \"\" and her film debut in 1992's \"Kuffs\".\nEarly life.\nJudd was born Ashley Tyler Ciminella, in 1968 in Granada Hills, Los Angeles. Her parents are Naomi Judd, who later became a country music singer and motivational speaker, and Michael Charles Ciminella, a marketing analyst for the horse racing industry. Ashley's elder half-sister, Wynonna Judd, is also a country music singer.\nAshley's paternal grandfather was of Sicilian (Italian) descent, and her paternal grandmother was a descendant of Mayflower pilgrim William Brewster.\nWhen Judd was born, her mother was a homemaker. Judd's parents divorced in 1972 when she was four. The following year, Judd's mother Naomi returned with Ashley to Kentucky, where Judd lived for most of her childhood. Judd has stated that even if she professionally uses her mother's maiden name, her legal surname is still the Ciminella of her father, as \"I loved both my last names and the branches of the family they represented\", and the one time she tried to legally change it the judge refused it.\nJudd attended 13 schools before college, including the Sayre School (Lexington, Kentucky), Paul G. Blazer High School (Ashland, Kentucky), and Franklin High School in Tennessee. She briefly tried modeling in Japan during a school break. At the University of Kentucky, she majored in French and minored in anthropology, art history, theater, and women's studies. She joined the sorority Kappa Kappa Gamma. Judd spent a semester studying in France as part of her major. She graduated from the University of Kentucky Honors Program and was nominated to Phi Beta Kappa.\nAfter college Judd moved to Hollywood, where she studied with acting teacher Robert Carnegie at Playhouse West. During this time, she worked as a hostess at The Ivy restaurant and lived in a Malibu rental house. Around that time, she returned East to Williamson County, Tennessee, where she lived near her mother and sister.\nCareer.\nStarting in 1991, Judd appeared as Ensign Robin Lefler, a Starfleet officer, in two episodes of \"\", \"Darmok\" and \"\". From 1991 to 1994, she had a recurring role as Reed, the daughter of Alex (Swoosie Kurtz), on the NBC drama \"Sisters\".\nShe made her feature film debut with a small role in 1992's \"Kuffs\". In 1993, she was cast in her first starring role playing the title character in Victor Nu\u00f1ez's \"Ruby in Paradise\". The latter film won the Sundance Film Festival Grand Jury Prize. Believing that this role would shape the rest of her career, Judd was extremely nervous before the audition, nearly getting into a car accident en route. \"From the first three sentences, I knew it was written for me\", she told the \"San Jose Mercury News\". She received positive reviews in her role as Ruby Lee Gissing, a young woman trying to make a new life for herself.\nNu\u00f1ez told biographer James L. Dickerson that Judd created the resonance of this character: \"The resonance, those moments, was not contrived. It was just a matter of creating the scene and trusting that it was worth telling.\"\nOliver Stone, who had seen Judd in Nu\u00f1ez's film, cast her in \"Natural Born Killers\" (1994), but her scenes were cut from the version of the film released theatrically. The following year, she gained critical acclaim for her role as Harvey Keitel's estranged daughter in Wayne Wang's \"Smoke\" and as Val Kilmer's wife in Michael Mann's \"Heat\". That same year she played the role of Callie in Philip Ridley's dark adult fairy tale \"The Passion of Darkly Noon\".\nIn 1996, she co-starred with Mira Sorvino as Marilyn Monroe in \"Norma Jean and Marilyn\", where she recreated the photo shoot for the centerfold for the first issue of \"Playboy\". The same year she had a supporting role in the thriller film \"A Time to Kill\". It received positive reviews and was a major box office success. By the end of the 1990s, Judd had achieved considerable success as a leading actress, having lead roles in additional thrillers that performed well at the box office, including \"Kiss the Girls\" (1997) and \"Double Jeopardy\" (1999).\nIn the early 2000s she starred in \"Where the Heart Is\" (2000), \"Someone Like You\" (2001), and \"High Crimes\" (2002). These were moderate box office successes. In 2002, Judd starred in \"Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood\", which performed well, and acted in the critically acclaimed film \"Frida.\"\nJudd played the role of Maggie the Cat in the 2003 Broadway revival of Tennessee Williams's \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\".\nIn 2004 she received praise and a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress, for her performance in \"De-Lovely\", opposite Kevin Kline, who played Cole Porter. She also starred in \"Twisted\" (2004). This was widely panned.\nIn 2010, Judd was Janet Tamaro's original choice for the role of Detective Jane Rizzoli in the TV series \"Rizzoli &amp; Isles\" but she declined. Angie Harmon took the role. In 2011, she co-starred in the family film \"Dolphin Tale\" and its 2014 sequel, \"Dolphin Tale 2\". Also in 2011, Judd co-starred with Patrick Dempsey in the film \"Flypaper\". In 2012, she starred as Rebecca Winstone on the ABC series \"Missing\".\nIn 2013, Judd played First Lady Margaret Asher in the action thriller \"Olympus Has Fallen\". In 2014, she appeared as Natalie Prior in \"Divergent\", which she reprised in the 2015 sequel ' and the 2016 penultimate film of the series '.\nIn 2014, Judd was the narrator of the documentary film about Turkish preacher Fethullah G\u00fclen, \"Love Is a Verb\", directed by Terry Spencer Hesser. The following year she became the first woman to narrate the opening for the telecast of the Kentucky Derby.\nSponsorships.\nStarting in 2004, Judd was the advertising \"face\" of American Beauty, an Est\u00e9e Lauder cosmetic brand sold at Kohl's department stores, and of H. Stern jewelers. In June 2007, Goody's Family Clothing launched three fashion clothing lines with Judd in the fall to be called \"AJ\", \"Love Ashley\", and \"Ashley Judd\". In 2008 they added an \"Ashley Judd Plus\" line.\nPersonal life.\nIn December 1999, Judd became engaged to Dario Franchitti, a Scottish racing driver who competed in Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART). They married in December 2001 at Skibo Castle in Scotland. They did not have any children, as she is known to have said: \"It's unconscionable to breed with the number of children who are starving to death in impoverished countries.\" They divorced in 2013.\nJudd is an avid martial arts practitioner: she has practiced kickboxing, judo, and Tae Bo.\nIn February 2006, she entered a program at Shades of Hope Treatment Center in Buffalo Gap, Texas and stayed for 47 days. She was there for treatment of depression, insomnia, and codependency.\nIn 2011, Judd released her memoir \"All That is Bitter and Sweet\", in which she discusses her life from adolescence to adulthood. The memoir concentrates on her humanitarian work as an adult.\nIn February 2021, while hiking in the jungle in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Judd shattered her leg. Porters transported her for 55 hours to reach a hospital for surgery in South Africa.\nJudd is a Christian and cited her faith as why she went public against Harvey Weinstein.\nEducation.\nIn May 2007, Judd received a BA in French at the University of Kentucky. She was awarded an Honorary DHL degree from Union College in Barbourville, Kentucky, on May 9, 2009. Judd undertook postgraduate study, earning a mid-career MPA degree from Harvard Kennedy School in 2010.\nIn August 2016, Judd enrolled at UC Berkeley to pursue a PhD in Public Policy at the Goldman School of Public Policy. She took a medical leave of absence two months later because she was suffering from siege migraines.\nInterests.\nJudd follows sports at her alma mater, and has attended many University of Kentucky basketball games.\nDuring the 2007 IndyCar season, Judd criticized allowing rookie Milka Duno to race. After the final race, Judd said to reporters, \"I know this is not very sportsmanlike, but they've got to get the 23 car (Duno) off the track. It's very dangerous. I'm tired of holding my tongue. She shouldn't be out there. When a car is 10 miles [an hour] off the pace, it's not appropriate to be racing. People's lives are at stake.\"\nSexual harassment and assault.\nIn October 2015, Judd told \"Variety\" that she had been sexually harassed by a studio mogul but did not name the person. In October 2017, she said the person was Harvey Weinstein, co-founder of Miramax, and said that the sexual harassment occurred during the filming of \"Kiss the Girls\".\nOn April 30, 2018, Judd filed a defamation and sexual harassment lawsuit against Weinstein, stating that he hurt her career by spreading lies about her after she rejected his sexual advances. Weinstein filed a motion to dismiss in July. In January 2019, a federal judge in California dismissed Judd's claim of sexual harassment against Weinstein but allowed Judd to pursue her defamation claim that Weinstein sabotaged her career.\nAt the Women in the World summit in April 2019, Judd addressed Georgia's six-week abortion ban, which had been passed in March 2019. She said that she had been raped three times, and became pregnant once. She said, \"As everyone knows, and I'm very open about it, I'm a three-time rape survivor. One of the times that I was raped there was conception and I'm very thankful I was able to access safe and legal abortion. Because the rapist, who is a Kentuckian, as am I, and I reside in Tennessee, has paternity rights in Kentucky and Tennessee, I would've had to co-parent with my rapist.\"\nActivism.\nJudd has conducted humanitarian work that focuses on gender equality, pro abortion causes and the rights of women and girls. In 2016, she was appointed a Goodwill Ambassador for UNFPA, the United Nations agency with responsibilities including sexual and reproductive health. As of May 2018, she had visited UNFPA's projects for women and girls affected by humanitarian crises in Jordan, Turkey, Ukraine, and Bangladesh, and its development work in India and Sri Lanka.\nJudd has travelled with YouthAIDS to places affected by illness and poverty, such as Cambodia, Kenya, and Rwanda. She has become an advocate for preventing poverty and promoting awareness internationally. She has met with political and religious leaders on behalf of the deprived about political and social change. Judd has narrated three documentaries for YouthAIDS that aired on the Discovery Channel, in National Geographic, and on VH1.\nIn 2011, she joined the Leadership Council of the International Center for Research on Women. Other organizations Judd has been involved with include Women for Women International and Equality Now. She is a member of the advisory board for Apne Aap Women Worldwide, an organization fighting sex-trafficking and inter-generational prostitution in India. Judd is active on the speakers' circuit, giving speeches about gender equality, abuse and humanitarian topics.\nPolitical activities.\nIn 2008, Judd supported Barack Obama's presidential campaign. In 2009, she appeared in a one-minute video advertisement for the Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund, in which Judd condemned Alaska Governor Sarah Palin for supporting aerial wolf hunting. In response, Palin stated the reason these wolves are killed is to protect the caribou population in Alaska. Palin called the Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund an \"extreme fringe group\". In 2010, Judd signed the Animal Legal Defense Fund's petition to urge Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear to protect that state's homeless animals through tough enforcement of Kentucky's Humane Shelter Law.\nShe was appointed Global Ambassador for YouthAIDS, an education and prevention program of the international NGO Population Services International (PSI), promoting AIDS prevention and treatment. Judd was honored November 10, 2009, as the recipient of the fourth annual \"USA\u00a0Today\" Hollywood Hero, awarded for her work with PSI. On October 29, 2006, Judd appeared at a \"Women for Ford\" event for Democratic Tennessee Senate candidate Harold Ford Jr. She has also campaigned extensively both locally and nationally for a variety of Democratic candidates, including President Barack Obama in critical swing states.\nOn September 8, 2010, CNN interviewed Judd about her second humanitarian mission to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Judd traveled with the Enough Project, a project to end genocide and crimes against humanity. In the interview, Judd discussed her efforts to raise awareness about how conflict minerals fuel sexual violence in Congo. During her trip, Judd visited hospitals for victims of sexual violence, camps for displaced persons, mines, and civil society organizations. On September 30, 2010, CNN published an op-ed titled \"Ashley Judd: Electronics fuel unspeakable violence\" by Judd and Enough Project co-founder John Prendergast regarding the continued violence in Congo. On November 26, 2010, she published a subsequent op-ed, \"Costs of Convenience\", excerpted from her trip diary from eastern Congo. These pieces discussed the recent provision in the Dodd-Frank Reform bill that requires companies to prove where their minerals originated, and the link between modern electronics (which rely on those minerals) and mining camps plagued by such violence.\nJudd represented Tennessee as a delegate to the 2012 Democratic National Convention. She also considered returning to Kentucky and challenging Senator Mitch McConnell in 2014. In response, the conservative Super PAC American Crossroads released an attack ad against Judd in Kentucky.\nIn February 2013, she invited her Twitter followers to join a mailing list, hinting that she might ultimately announce a run for the Senate to those on the list. However, she announced on March 27, 2013, that she would not run, citing her need to be focused on her family. Judd later endorsed Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes.\nOn July 26, 2016, Judd attended a Creative Coalition luncheon in support of DC Statehood that took place during the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. The event, hosted by Washington, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser and Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, also included actors Elizabeth Banks, Tim Daly, Josh Gad, William Baldwin, and David Schwimmer.\nIn January 2020, Judd endorsed Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren in her run for the presidency.\nOn July 12, 2024, Judd wrote an op-ed for \"USA Today\" calling on President Joe Biden to suspend his 2024 reelection campaign. She wrote Biden was \"incapable of countering Trump, while he, unchecked, gushed a firehose of galling lies\" at the first presidential debate of the cycle in late June, 2024. \"The Independent\" called it \"a deeply personal and heartfelt op-ed\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She first signed a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1941 and appeared mainly in small roles until she drew critics' attention in 1946 with her performance in Robert Siodmak's film noir \"The Killers\".\nDuring the 1950s, Gardner established herself as a leading lady and one of the era's top stars with films like \"Show Boat\", \"Pandora and the Flying Dutchman\" (both 1951), \"The Snows of Kilimanjaro\" (1952), \"Mogambo\" (1953), \"The Barefoot Contessa\" (1954), \"Bhowani Junction\" (1956) and \"On the Beach\" (1959). She continued her film career for three more decades, appearing in the films \"55 Days at Peking\" (1963), \"Seven Days in May\" (1964), \"\" (1966), and \"Mayerling\" (1968). She continued to act regularly until 1986, four years before her death in 1990, at the age of 67.\nShe was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in \"Mogambo\", and for both a Golden Globe Award and BAFTA Award, in the category of Best Actress, for her performance in \"The Night of the Iguana\". In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked Gardner No.\u00a025 on its greatest female screen legends list.\nEarly life.\nGardner was born on December 24, 1922, in Grabtown, North Carolina, the youngest of seven children. When Gardner was born, by community standards, they were \u201cbetter than well-to-do\u201d with her father having the deed to their tobacco and cotton farm, and owning a sawmill and a country store. She was of English and Scots Irish ancestry. \nShe was raised in the Baptist faith of her mother. While the children were still young, during the Depression the family lost their property. Gardner's mother received an offer to work as a cook and housekeeper at a dormitory for teachers at the nearby Brogden School that included board for the family, and Gardner's father sharecropped tobacco and supplemented the dwindling work with odd jobs at sawmills. In 1931, the teachers' school closed, forcing the family to finally give up on their property dreams and move to Newport News, Virginia, where Gardner's mother found work managing a boarding house for the city's many shipworkers. While in Newport News, Gardner's father became ill and died from bronchitis in 1938, when Gardner was 15 years old. After her father's death, the family moved to Rock Ridge near Wilson, North Carolina, where Gardner's mother ran another boarding house for teachers. Gardner attended high school in Rock Ridge and she graduated from there in 1939. The family was not well off and, to the ridicule of her classmates, she had to wear hand-me-down clothes to school. She then attended secretarial classes at Atlantic Christian College in Wilson for about a year.\nCareer.\nGardner was visiting her sister in New York City in the summer of 1940 when her brother-in-law, a professional photographer, offered to take her portrait as a gift for her mother. He was so pleased with the results that he displayed the finished product in the front window of his photography studio on Fifth Avenue.\nBarnard Duhan, a legal clerk at Loews Theatres, spotted Gardner's portrait in her brother-in-law's studio. At the time, Duhan often posed as a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) talent scout to meet girls, using the fact that MGM was a subsidiary of Loews. Duhan entered Gardner's brother-in-law's studio and tried to get her number, but he was rebuffed by the receptionist. Duhan made the comment \"Somebody should send her info to MGM\", and her brother-in-law did so immediately. Shortly after, Gardner, who at the time was a student at Atlantic Christian College, traveled to New York to be interviewed at MGM's New York office by Al Altman, head of MGM's New York talent department. With cameras rolling, he directed the 18-year-old to walk toward the camera, turn and walk away, then rearrange some flowers in a vase. He did not attempt to record her voice because her strong Southern accent made understanding her difficult for him. Louis B. Mayer, head of MGM, however, sent a telegram to Altman: \"She can't sing. She can't act. She can't talk. She's terrific!\" She was offered a standard contract by the studio and left school for Hollywood in 1941, with her sister accompanying her. MGM's first order of business was to provide her with a speech coach because her Carolina drawl was nearly incomprehensible to them, and Harriet Lee as her singing teacher.\nHer first appearance in a feature film was as a walk-on in the Norma Shearer vehicle \"We Were Dancing\" (1942). Fifteen bit parts later, she received her first screen billing in \"Ghosts on the Loose\" (1943), and she is featured by name on the theatrical poster. After five years of bit parts, mostly at MGM and many of them uncredited, Gardner came to prominence in the Mark Hellinger production \"The Killers\" (1946), playing the \"femme fatale\" Kitty Collins. Although she had good reviews, she kept a fragile self-image. \u201cAva wouldn't even go eat in the commissary because she was so scared to walk in and see Lana Turner and Greer Garson,\u201d says actress Arlene Dahl.\nFilms from the next decade or so include \"The Hucksters\" (1947), \"One Touch of Venus\" (1948), \"Show Boat\" (1951), Pandora and the Flying Dutchman (1951 film) Criterion.com)\"The Snows of Kilimanjaro\" (1952), \"Lone Star\" (1952), \"Mogambo\", nominated for a Best Actress Academy Award (1953), \"The Barefoot Contessa\" (1954), \"Bhowani Junction\" (1956), \"The Sun Also Rises\" (1957) and \"On the Beach\" (1959). Off-camera, she could be witty and pithy, as in her assessment of director John Ford, who directed \"Mogambo\" (\"The meanest man on earth. Thoroughly evil. Adored him!\") In \"The Barefoot Contessa\", she played the role of doomed beauty Maria Vargas, a fiercely independent woman who goes from Spanish dancer to international movie star with the help of a Hollywood director played by Humphrey Bogart, with tragic consequences. Gardner's decision to accept the role was influenced by her own lifelong habit of going barefoot. Gardner played the role of Guinevere in \"Knights of the Round Table\" (1953), with actor Robert Taylor as Sir Lancelot. Indicative of her sophistication, she portrayed a duchess, a baroness, and other women of noble lineage in her films of the 1950s.\nGardner played the role of Soledad in \"The Angel Wore Red\" (1960) with Dirk Bogarde as the male lead. She was billed between Charlton Heston and David Niven for \"55 Days at Peking\" (1963), which was set in China during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900. The following year, she played her last major leading role in the critically acclaimed \"The Night of the Iguana\" (1964), based upon a Tennessee Williams play, and starring Richard Burton as an atheist clergyman and Deborah Kerr as a gentle artist traveling with her aged poet grandfather. John Huston directed the movie in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, insisting on making the film in black-and-white \u2013 a decision he later regretted because of the vivid colors of the flora. Gardner received billing below Burton, but above Kerr. She was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama and BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role for her performance.\nShe next appeared again with Burt Lancaster, her co-star from \"The Killers\", this time with Kirk Douglas and Fredric March, in \"Seven Days in May\" (1964), a thriller about an attempted military takeover of the US government. Gardner played a former love interest of Lancaster's who could have been instrumental in Douglas preventing a coup against the President of the United States.\nJohn Huston chose Gardner for the part of Sarah, the wife of Abraham (played by George C. Scott), in the Dino De Laurentiis film \"\", which was released in 1966. In a 1964 interview, she talked about why she accepted the role:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He [Huston] had more faith in me than I did myself. Now I'm glad I listened, for it is a challenging role and a very demanding one. I start out as a young wife, and age through various periods, forcing me to adjust psychologically to each age. It is a complete departure for me, and most intriguing. In this role, I must create a character, not just play one.\nTwo years later, in 1966, Gardner briefly sought the role of Mrs. Robinson in Mike Nichols' \"The Graduate\" (1967). She reportedly called Nichols and said \"I want to see you! I want to talk about this \"Graduate\" thing!\" Nichols never seriously considered her for the part, preferring to cast a younger woman (Anne Bancroft was 35, while Gardner was 44), but he did visit her hotel, where he later said \"she sat at a little French desk with a telephone, she went through every movie star clich\u00e9. She said, 'All right, let's talk about your movie. First of all, I strip for nobody.'\"\nGardner moved to London in 1966, undergoing an elective hysterectomy to allay her worries of contracting the uterine cancer that had claimed the life of her mother. Two years later, she appeared in \"Mayerling\", in which she played the supporting role of Austrian Empress Elisabeth of Austria, with James Mason as Emperor Franz Joseph I.\nHer last appearance was in 1986 in the television film \"Maggie\". Gardner authored a book about her life titled \"Ava: My Story\" published by Random House Publishing Group in 1990.\nPersonal life.\nMarriages.\nSoon after Gardner arrived in Los Angeles, she met fellow MGM contract player Mickey Rooney; they married on January 10, 1942. The ceremony was held in the remote town of Ballard, California because MGM studio head Louis B. Mayer was worried that fans would desert Rooney's Andy Hardy movie series if it became known that their star was married. Gardner divorced Rooney in 1943, citing mental cruelty, privately blaming his gambling and womanizing. She did not ruin his on-screen image as the clean-cut, judge's son Andy Hardy that the public adored.\nGardner's second marriage was equally brief, to jazz musician and bandleader Artie Shaw, from 1945 to 1946. Shaw previously had been married to Lana Turner. Gardner's third was to singer and actor Frank Sinatra from 1951 to 1957. She later said in her autobiography that he was the love of her life. Sinatra left his wife Nancy for Gardner, and their marriage made headlines.\nSinatra was criticized by gossip columnists Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons, the Hollywood establishment, the Catholic Church, and by his fans for leaving his wife. Gardner used her considerable influence, particularly with Harry Cohn, to get Sinatra cast in his Oscar-winning role in \"From Here to Eternity\" (1953). This role and the award revitalized both Sinatra's acting and singing careers.\nThe Gardner\u2013Sinatra marriage was tumultuous. During their marriage, Gardner became pregnant twice, but aborted both pregnancies. \"MGM had all sorts of penalty clauses about their stars having babies\", according to her autobiography, which was published eight months after her death. Gardner filed for divorce in 1954, and the divorce was finalized in 1957.\nFollowing their divorce, Gardner and Sinatra remained good friends for the rest of her life.\nRelationships.\nGardner became a friend and proteg\u00e9 of businessman and aviator Howard Hughes in the early to mid-1940s, and the relationship lasted into the 1950s. Gardner stated in her autobiography, \"Ava: My Story\", that she was never in love with Hughes, but he was in and out of her life for about 20 years. Hughes' trust in Gardner was what kept their relationship alive. She described him as \"painfully shy, completely enigmatic, and more eccentric...than anyone [she] had ever met\".\nGardner had several other affairs including with matador Luis Miguel Domingu\u00edn, actor George C. Scott, and Claude Terrail, the restaurateur of the Paris restaurant La Tour d'Argent.\nGardner lived her last 35 years outside of the United States. She first visited Spain in 1950, and she moved to Madrid in 1955, living there until 1966, when she moved to London. She lived at 34 Ennismore Gardens in Westminster in London, her final residence when she died.\nGardner had a close friendship with Gregory Peck, with whom she starred in three films, the first one being \"The Great Sinner\" (1949). Their friendship lasted the rest of Gardner's life, and, upon her death in 1990, Peck took in both her housekeeper and her dog.\nReligion and political views.\nAlthough Gardner was raised Baptist, at the end of her life she said she had no religion. Christianity never played a positive role in her life, according to biographers and Gardner, in her autobiography \"Ava: My Story\". Her friend Zoe Sallis, who met her on the set of \"\" when Gardner was living with John Huston in Puerto Vallarta, said Gardner always seemed unconcerned about religion. When Sallis asked her about religion once, Gardner replied, \"It's not anything Christian\". \nAnother factor that contributed to Gardner's outlook was the death of her father during her youth. She said, \"Nobody wanted to know Daddy when he was dying. He was so alone. He was scared. I could see the fear in his eyes when he was smiling. I went to see the preacher, the guy who'd baptized me. I begged him to come and visit Daddy, just to talk to him, you know? Give him a blessing or something. But he never did. I had no time for religion after that.\" \nConcerning politics, Gardner was a lifelong Democrat, and she supported Adlai Stevenson II in the 1952 United States presidential election. Gardner was a staunch supporter of civil rights for African Americans throughout her life. As a child growing up in North Carolina, she would often sit with African American children in segregated parts of movie theaters. Her personal assistant, Rene Jordan, was African American, and Gardner would often take her to clubs that were for whites only. She supported Henry A. Wallace of the Progressive Party, whose campaign in 1948 for the presidential election sought racial equality and desegregation.\nShe became a member of the NAACP in August 1968.\nDeath.\nIn 1986, Gardner suffered a stroke. Although she could afford her medical expenses, Frank Sinatra wanted to pay for her visit to a specialist in the United States, and she allowed him to make the arrangements for a medically staffed private plane. She died at age 67 of bronchopneumonia on January 25, 1990 in Westminster, London, England.\nGardner was buried on January 29 in Sunset Memorial Park in Smithfield, North Carolina, next to her siblings and their parents, Jonas and Molly Gardner. The Ava Gardner Museum, incorporated in 1996, is located nearby.\nBooks.\nGardner authored a book about her life titled \"Ava: My Story\" published by Random House Publishing Group in 1990 with an illustrated reprint by Random House's subsidiary Bantam Books in 1992.\nIn the last years of her life, Gardner asked Peter Evans to ghostwrite her autobiography, stating: \"I either write the book or sell the jewels.\" Despite meeting with Evans frequently, and approving of most of his copy, Gardner eventually learned that Evans, along with the BBC, had once been sued by her ex-husband Frank Sinatra. Gardner and Evans's friendship subsequently cooled, and Evans left the project. Evans' notes and sections of his draft of Gardner's autobiography, which he based on their taped conversations, were published in his book \"\" after Evans' death in 2012.\nFilm portrayals.\nGardner has been portrayed by Marcia Gay Harden in the 1992 miniseries \"Sinatra\", by Deborah Kara Unger in the 1998 television film \"The Rat Pack\", by Kate Beckinsale in the 2004 Howard Hughes biopic \"The Aviator\", Anna Drijver in the 2012 Italian TV film \"Walter Chiari \u2013 Fino all'ultima risata\", and Emily Elicia Low in \"Frank &amp; Ava\" (2018).\nThe images of Gardner and Clark Gable are featured on the cover of Robin Gibb's 1983 album \"How Old Are You?\"\nThe 2018 Spanish television series \"Arde Madrid\" is a comedy-drama with thriller elements based on elements of Ava Gardner's life in mid-20th century Spain. Gardner is portrayed by Debi Mazar.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She was named 15 December 2001 in Tomrefjord with Minister of Defence Kristin Krohn Devold as godmother, and delivered to the Coast Guard on 18 January 2002. She entered service in mid-2002 and is homeported in Sortland. Her primary operating area is in the Arctic waters north of Norway, the Barents Sea and around the Svalbard islands.\n\"Svalbard\" is the second largest ship in Norway's military armed forces (by tonnage), designed to supplement the three other helicopter-carrying ships of the Norwegian Coast Guard - the s. She is NBC-protected with constant overpressure, and is capable of icebreaking and emergency towing up to 100,000 tons. The Norwegian coastline is generally free of ice, thus \"Svalbard\" is the one of just two Norwegian icebreaking-capable vessel, the other being . A double acting ship, \"Svalbard\" is designed to break ice both ahead and astern.\nCareer.\nOn 21 August 2019, \"Svalbard\" became the first Norwegian ship to reach the North Pole.\nIn October 2020, \"Svalbard\" was deployed to the Bering Sea to retrieve scientific instruments belonging to the Coordinated Arctic Acoustic Thermometry Experiment (CAATEX) from the seabed, a task previously assigned to the United States Coast Guard icebreaker that had been sidelined earlier that year following an onboard fire. The vessel sailed to the western hemisphere along a high-latitude route north of Svalbard and Franz Josef Land, and outside of Russian territorial waters. Despite the scientific mission, a number of Russian media outlets interpreted this voyage as an \"intrusion\" to the Russian Arctic by an \"armed NATO warship\".\nThe 2023 defence acquisition plan indicated that the ship would receive necessary upgrades to permit her to continue in service.\nForeign analogs.\nOn 9 July 2007 Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced that Canada would build six to eight arctic offshore patrol ships (AOPS) for the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN), modeled after \"Svalbard\"'s design. The vessels' design was modified to meet the needs of the RCN. Some of the modifications include: increasing the ships' ice breaking capabilities, adding a larger and fully enclosed forecastle/cable deck for greater arctic protection, addition of a multipurpose operational space, updated command and control systems, an updated sensor suite, and an extended hangar for the larger Sikorsky CH-148 Cyclone helicopter. The project was criticized for its high costs. For example, Irving Shipbuilding was awarded a CA$288 million design contract for the vessel while the design of \"Svalbard\" and similar patrol ships within other countries paid less than one-tenth as much. The first ship in its class, , was delivered to the RCN on 31 July 2020, with its commissioning anticipated in mid-2021 following the completion of post-acceptance sea trials.\nIn 2015 Russia started constructing the first of several vessels in its Project 23550. Think tank Global Security pointed out these vessels are almost the same length, displacement, power and endurance as the \"Svalbard\" class. They will also be able to travel through roughly the same depth of ice. The Russian vessels will be more heavily armed, with a main cannon, an anti-missile gatling gun, and launchers for eight cruise missiles.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

(Cilia are absent in bacteria and archaea.) The cilium has the shape of a slender threadlike projection that extends from the surface of the much larger cell body. Eukaryotic flagella found on sperm cells and many protozoans have a similar structure to motile cilia that enables swimming through liquids; they are longer than cilia and have a different undulating motion.\nThere are two major classes of cilia: \"motile\" and \"non-motile\" cilia, each with two subtypes, giving four types in all. A cell will typically have one primary cilium or many motile cilia. The structure of the cilium core, called the axoneme, determines the cilium class. Most motile cilia have a central pair of single microtubules surrounded by nine pairs of double microtubules called a 9+2 axoneme. Most non-motile cilia have a 9+0 axoneme that lacks the central pair of microtubules. Also lacking are the associated components that enable motility including the outer and inner dynein arms, and radial spokes. Some motile cilia lack the central pair, and some non-motile cilia have the central pair, hence the four types.\nMost non-motile cilia, termed \"primary cilia\" or \"sensory cilia\", serve solely as sensory organelles. Most vertebrate cell types possess a single non-motile primary cilium, which functions as a cellular antenna. Olfactory neurons possess a great many non-motile cilia. Non-motile cilia that have a central pair of microtubules are the kinocilia present on hair cells.\nMotile cilia are found in large numbers on respiratory epithelial cells \u2013 around 200 cilia per cell, where they function in mucociliary clearance, and also have mechanosensory and chemosensory functions. Motile cilia on ependymal cells move the cerebrospinal fluid through the ventricular system of the brain. Motile cilia are also present in the oviducts (fallopian tubes) of female (therian) mammals, where they function in moving egg cells from the ovary to the uterus. Motile cilia that lack the central pair of microtubules are found in the cells of the embryonic primitive node; termed \"nodal cells\", these nodal cilia are responsible for the left-right asymmetry of bilaterians.\nStructure.\nCilia can be between one and five micrometers in length. A cilium is assembled and built from a basal body on the cell surface. From the basal body, the ciliary rootlet forms ahead of the transition plate and transition zone where the earlier microtubule triplets change to the microtubule doublets of the axoneme.\nBasal body.\nThe foundation of the cilium is the basal body, a modified mother centriole on the cell surface. Mammalian basal bodies consist of a barrel of nine triplet microtubules, subdistal appendages and nine strut-like structures, known as distal appendages, which attach the basal body to the membrane at the base of the cilium. Two of each of the basal body's triplet microtubules extend during growth of the axoneme to become the doublet microtubules.\nCiliary rootlet.\nThe ciliary rootlet is a cytoskeleton-like structure that originates from the basal body at the proximal end of a cilium. Rootlets are typically 80-100\u00a0nm in diameter and contain cross striae distributed at regular intervals of approximately 55-70\u00a0nm. A prominent component of the rootlet is rootletin a coiled coil rootlet protein coded for by the \"CROCC\" gene.\nTransition zone.\nTo achieve its distinct composition, the proximal-most region of the cilium consists of a transition zone, also known as the ciliary gate, that controls the entry and exit of proteins to and from the cilium. At the transition zone, Y-shaped structures connect the ciliary membrane to the underlying axoneme. Control of selective entry into cilia may involve a sieve-like function of transition zone. Inherited defects in components of the transition zone cause ciliopathies, such as Joubert syndrome. Transition zone structure and function is conserved across diverse organisms, including vertebrates, \"Caenorhabditis elegans\", \"Drosophila melanogaster\" and \"Chlamydomonas reinhardtii\". In mammals, disruption of the transition zone reduces the ciliary abundance of membrane-associated ciliary proteins, such as those involved in Hedgehog signal transduction, compromising Hedgehog-dependent embryonic development of digit number and central nervous system patterning.\nAxoneme.\nInside a cilium is a microtubule-based cytoskeletal core called the axoneme. The axoneme of a primary cilium typically has a ring of nine outer microtubule doublets (called a 9+0 axoneme), and the axoneme of a motile cilium has, in addition to the nine outer doublets, two central microtubule singlets (called a 9+2 axoneme). This is the same axoneme type of the flagellum. The axoneme in a motile cilium acts as a scaffold for the inner and outer dynein arms that move the cilium, and provides tracks for the microtubule motor proteins of kinesin and dynein. The transport of ciliary components is carried out by intraflagellar transport (IFT) which is similar to the axonal transport in a nerve fibre. Transport is bidirectional and cytoskeletal motor proteins kinesin and dynein transport ciliary components along the microtubule tracks; kinesin in an anterograde movement towards the ciliary tip and dynein in a retrograde movement towards the cell body. The cilium has its own ciliary membrane enclosed within the surrounding cell membrane.\nTypes.\nNon-motile cilia.\nIn animals, non-motile primary cilia are found on nearly every type of cell, blood cells being a prominent exception. Most cells only possess one, in contrast to cells with motile cilia, an exception being olfactory sensory neurons, where the odorant receptors are located, which each possess about ten cilia. Some cell types, such as retinal photoreceptor cells, possess highly specialized primary cilia.\nAlthough the primary cilium was discovered in 1898, it was largely ignored for a century and considered a vestigial organelle without important function. Recent findings regarding its physiological roles in chemosensation, signal transduction, and cell growth control, have revealed its importance in cell function. Its importance to human biology has been underscored by the discovery of its role in a diverse group of diseases caused by the dysgenesis or dysfunction of cilia, such as polycystic kidney disease, congenital heart disease, mitral valve prolapse, and retinal degeneration, called ciliopathies. The primary cilium is now known to play an important role in the function of many human organs. Primary cilia on pancreatic beta cells regulate their function and energy metabolism. Cilia deletion can lead to islet dysfunction and type 2 diabetes.\nCilia are assembled during the G1 phase and are disassembled before mitosis occurs. Disassembly of cilia requires the action of aurora kinase A. \nThe current scientific understanding of primary cilia views them as \"sensory cellular antennae that coordinate many cellular signaling pathways, sometimes coupling the signaling to ciliary motility or alternatively to cell division and differentiation.\"\nThe cilium is composed of subdomains and enclosed by a plasma membrane continuous with the plasma membrane of the cell. For many cilia, the basal body, where the cilium originates, is located within a membrane invagination called the ciliary pocket. The cilium membrane and the basal body microtubules are connected by distal appendages (also called transition fibers). Vesicles carrying molecules for the cilia dock at the distal appendages. Distal to the transition fibers form a transition zone where entry and exit of molecules is regulated to and from the cilia. Some of the signaling with these cilia occur through ligand binding such as Hedgehog signaling. Other forms of signaling include G protein-coupled receptors including the somatostatin receptor 3 in neurons.\nModified non-motile cilia.\nKinocilia that are found on hair cells in the inner ear are termed as specialized primary cilia, or modified non-motile cilia. They possess the 9+2 axoneme of the motile cilia but lack the inner dynein arms that give movement. They do move passively following the detection of sound, allowed by the outer dynein arms.\nMotile cilia.\nMammals also have motile cilia or secondary cilia that are usually present on a cell's surface in large numbers (multiciliate), and beat in coordinated metachronal waves. Multiciliated cells are found lining the respiratory tract where they function in mucociliary clearance sweeping mucus containing debris away from the lungs. Each cell in the respiratory epithelium has around 200 motile cilia.\nIn the reproductive tract, smooth muscle contractions help the beating of the cilia in moving the egg cell from the ovary to the uterus.\nIn the ventricles of the brain ciliated ependymal cells circulate the cerebrospinal fluid.\nThe functioning of motile cilia is strongly dependent on the maintenance of optimal levels of periciliary fluid bathing the cilia. Epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) are specifically expressed along the entire length of cilia in the respiratory tract, and fallopian tube or \"oviduct\" that apparently serve as sensors to regulate the periciliary fluid.\nModified motile cilia.\nMotile cilia without the central pair of singlets (9+0) are found in early embryonic development. They are present as nodal cilia on the nodal cells of the primitive node. Nodal cells are responsible for the left-right asymmetry in bilateral animals. While lacking the central apparatus there are dynein arms present that allow the nodal cilia to move in a spinning fashion. The movement creates a current flow of the extraembryonic fluid across the nodal surface in a leftward direction that initiates the left-right asymmetry in the developing embryo.\nMotile, multiple, 9+0 cilia are found on the epithelial cells of the choroid plexus. Cilia also can change structure when introduced to hot temperatures and become sharp. They are present in large numbers on each cell and move relatively slowly, making them intermediate between motile and primary cilia. In addition to 9+0 cilia that are mobile, there are also solitary 9+2 cilia that stay immobile found in hair cells.\nNodal cilia.\nNodal cells have a single cilium called a monocilium. They are present in the very early development of the embryo on the primitive node. There are two areas of the node with different types of nodal cilia. On the central node are motile cilia, and on the peripheral area of the node the nodal cilia are modified motile.\nThe motile cilia on the central cells rotate to generate the leftward flow of extracellular fluid needed to initiate the left-right asymmetry.\nCilia versus flagella.\nThe motile cilia on sperm cells and many protozoans enables swimming through liquids and are traditionally referred to as \"flagella\". As these protrusions are structurally identical to motile cilia, attempts at preserving this terminology include making a distinction by morphology (\"flagella\" are typically longer than ordinary cilia and have a different undulating motion) and by number.\nMicroorganisms.\nCiliates are eukaryotic microorganisms that possess motile cilia exclusively and use them for either locomotion or to simply move liquid over their surface. A \"Paramecium\" for example is covered in thousands of cilia that enable its swimming. These motile cilia have been shown to be also sensory.\nCiliogenesis.\nCilia are formed through the process of ciliogenesis. An early step is docking of the basal body to the growing ciliary membrane, after which the transition zone forms. The building blocks of the ciliary axoneme, such as tubulins, are added at the ciliary tips through a process that depends partly on intraflagellar transport (IFT). Exceptions include \"Drosophila\" sperm and \"Plasmodium falciparum\" flagella formation, in which cilia assemble in the cytoplasm.\nAt the base of the cilium where it attaches to the cell body is the microtubule organizing center, the basal body. Some basal body proteins as CEP164, ODF2\nand CEP170, are required for the formation and the stability of the cilium.\nIn effect, the cilium is a nanomachine composed of perhaps over 600 proteins in molecular complexes, many of which also function independently as nanomachines. Flexible linkers allow the \nmobile protein domains\nconnected by them to recruit their binding partners and induce \nlong-range allostery via \nFunction.\nThe dynein in the axoneme \u2013 axonemal dynein forms bridges between neighbouring microtubule doublets. When ATP activates the motor domain of dynein, it attempts to walk along the adjoining microtubule doublet. This would force the adjacent doublets to slide over one another if not for the presence of nexin between the microtubule doublets. And thus the force generated by dynein is instead converted into a bending motion.\nSensing the extracellular environment.\nSome primary cilia on epithelial cells in eukaryotes act as \"cellular antennae\", providing chemosensation, thermosensation and mechanosensation of the extracellular environment. These cilia then play a role in mediating specific signalling cues, including soluble factors in the external cell environment, a secretory role in which a soluble protein is released to have an effect downstream of the fluid flow, and mediation of fluid flow if the cilia are motile.\nSome epithelial cells are ciliated, and they commonly exist as a sheet of polarized cells forming a tube or tubule with cilia projecting into the lumen. This sensory and signalling role puts cilia in a central role for maintaining the local cellular environment and may be why ciliary defects cause such a wide range of human diseases.\nIn the embryo, nodal cilia are used to direct the flow of extracellular fluid. This leftward movement is to generate left-right asymmetry across the midline of the embryo. Central cilia coordinate their rotational beating while the immotile cilia on the sides sense the direction of the flow. Studies in mice suggest a biophysical mechanism by which the direction of flow is sensed.\nAxo-ciliary synapse.\nWith axo-ciliary synapses, there is communication between serotonergic axons and primary cilia of CA1 pyramidal neurons that alters the neuron's epigenetic state in the nucleus \u2013 \"a way to change what is being transcribed or made in the nucleus\" via this signalling distinct from that at the plasma membrane which also is longer-term.\nClinical significance.\nCiliary defects can lead to a number of human diseases. Defects in cilia adversely affect many critical signaling pathways essential to embryonic development and to adult physiology, and thus offer a plausible hypothesis for the often multi-symptom nature of diverse ciliopathies. Known ciliopathies include primary ciliary dyskinesia, Bardet\u2013Biedl syndrome, polycystic kidney and liver disease, nephronophthisis, Alstr\u00f6m syndrome, Meckel\u2013Gruber syndrome, Sensenbrenner syndrome and some forms of retinal degeneration. Genetic mutations compromising the proper functioning of cilia, ciliopathies, can cause chronic disorders such as primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), nephronophthisis, and Senior\u2013L\u00f8ken syndrome. In addition, a defect of the primary cilium in the renal tubule cells can lead to polycystic kidney disease (PKD). In another genetic disorder called Bardet\u2013Biedl syndrome (BBS), the mutant gene products are the components in the basal body and cilia. Defects in cilia cells are linked to obesity and often pronounced in type 2 diabetes. Several studies already showed impaired glucose tolerance and reduction in the insulin secretion in the ciliopathy models. Moreover, the number and length of cilia was decreased in the type 2 diabetes models.\nEpithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) that are expressed along the length of cilia regulate periciliary fluid level. Mutations that decrease the activity of ENaCs result in multisystem pseudohypoaldosteronism, that is associated with fertility problems. In cystic fibrosis that results from mutations in the chloride channel CFTR, ENaC activity is enhanced leading to a severe reduction of the fluid level that causes complications and infections in the respiratory airways.\nSince the flagellum of human sperm has the same internal structure of a cilium, ciliary dysfunction can also be responsible for male infertility.\nThere is an association of primary ciliary dyskinesia with left-right anatomic abnormalities such as situs inversus (a combination of findings is known as Kartagener syndrome), and situs ambiguus (also known as \"Heterotaxy syndrome\"). These left-right anatomic abnormalities can also result in congenital heart disease. It has been shown that proper cilial function is responsible for the normal left-right asymmetry in mammals.\nThe diverse outcomes caused by ciliary dysfunction may result from alleles of different strengths that compromise ciliary functions in different ways or to different extents. Many ciliopathies are inherited in a Mendelian manner, but specific genetic interactions between distinct functional ciliary complexes, such as transition zone and BBS complexes, can alter the phenotypic manifestations of recessive ciliopathies. Some mutations in transition zone proteins can cause specific serious ciliopathies.\nExtracellular changes.\nReduction of cilia function can also result from infection. Research into biofilms has shown that bacteria can alter cilia. A biofilm is a community of bacteria of either the same or multiple species of bacteria. The cluster of cells secretes different factors which form an extracellular matrix. Cilia in the respiratory system is known to move mucus and pathogens out of the airways. It has been found that patients with biofilm positive infections have impaired cilia function. The impairment may present as decreased motion or reduction in the number of cilia. Though these changes result from an external source, they still effect the pathogenicity of the bacteria, progression of infection, and how it is treated.\nThe transportation of the immature egg cell, and the embryo to the uterus for implantation depends on the combination of regulated smooth muscle contractions, and ciliary beating. Dysfunction in this transportation can result in an ectopic pregnancy where the embryo is implanted (usually) in the fallopian tube before reaching its proper destination of the uterus. Many factors can affect this stage including infection and menstrual cycle hormones. Smoking (causing inflammation), and infection can reduce the numbers of cilia, and the ciliary beat can be affected by hormonal changes.\nPrimary cilia in pancreatic cells.\nThe pancreas is a mixture of highly differentiated exocrine and endocrine cells. Primary cilia are present in exocrine cells, which are centroacinar duct cells. Endocrine tissue is composed of different hormone-secreting cells. Insulin-secreting beta cells and glucagon-secreting alpha cells are highly ciliated.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It combines four-on-the-floor rhythms with breakbeats usually sampled from hip hop. In addition to the inclusion of breakbeats, the genre also features shuffled drum machine patterns, hoover, and other noises originating from new beat and Belgian techno, sounds from acid house and bleep techno, and often upbeat house piano riffs and vocals.\nHistory.\nEarly 1990s: origins.\nThe rave scene expanded rapidly in the early 1990s, both at clubs up and down the country including Labrynth, Shelley's Laserdome, The Eclipse, and Sanctuary Music Arena, and large raves in Warehouses and in the open air attracting 20\u201350,000 whether put on legally from promoters such as Fantazia and Raindance, or unlicensed by free party sound systems such as Spiral Tribe. Breakbeat hardcore drew its melting pot of sound from a vast array of influences \u2013 from new beat and Belgian techno that had for a short period been prominent in the UK rave scene, to house and acid house, and furthermore drawing on hip hop and reggae culture. \nAmongst the influences from within the rave scene itself upon which this strain of hardcore drew were such acts as Manix, The Hypnotist, CJ Bolland with his \"Ravesignal\" series, and T99. From outside of the rave scene, the sped-up breakbeats of Britcore acts like Hardnoise, MC Duke, Demon Boyz, and Hijack were highly influential. Members of the Britcore and UK hip hop scene quickly moved into hardcore themselves, like MC Duke and Leader One, The Criminal Minds, and Liam Howlett of Cut 2 Kill (who would go on to form the Prodigy). Pioneering the fusion of sounds from acid house, hip hop, and reggae were late '80s UK hip house veterans like Double Trouble, Rebel MC, Blapps Posse, and Shut Up and Dance, becoming pivotal contributors to hardcore and its derivative genres like jungle.\nThe huge increase in producers was also driven by the increasing availability of cheap home computer-based studio setups, particularly Cubase for the Atari ST.\nNotable releases.\nNotable releases include \"Baptised by Dub\" by The Criminal Minds (White House, 1992), \"Be Free\" by Noise Factory (Ibiza, 1992), \"Everybody in the Place\" and \"Experience\" by The Prodigy (XL Recordings, 1991), \"Trip II the Moon\" by Acen (Production House Records, 1992), \"Cookin Up Yah Brain\" by 4hero (Reinforced Records, 1992), \"On a Ragga Tip\" by SL2 (XL Recordings, 1992), \"Far Out\" by Sonz of a Loop Da Loop Era (Suburban Base, 1991), \"Full On... Mask Hysteria\" by Altern-8 (Network Records, 1991), \"Frequency\" by Shades of Rhythm (ZTT Records, 1991), \"Hurt You So\" by Jonny L (Yoyo, 1992), \"I Want You (Forever)\" by Carl Cox (Perfecto Records, 1991), \"Let Me Be Your Fantasy\" by Baby D (Production House, 1992), \"Mohamed's Mind\" by 2 Kilos (Radioactive Lamb, 1990), \"Music Takes You\" by Blame (Moving Shadow, 1991), \"Some Justice\" by Urban Shakedown (Urban Shakedown, 1992), \"Spliffhead\" by Ragga Twins (SUAD Records, 1991), \"Sweet Harmony\" by Liquid (XL Recordings, 1992), \"The Bouncer\" by Kicks Like a Mule (Tribal Base, 1992), \"Raving I'm Raving\" by Shut Up and Dance (SUAD Records, 1992), \"The Wickedest Sound\" by Rebel MC (Desire, 1991), \"Bombscare\" by 2 Bad Mice (Moving Shadow, 1992), and \"We Are I.E.\" by Lennie De Ice (Reel 2 Reel, 1991).\nMid-1990s: fragmentation.\nBy late 1992, breakbeat hardcore started to fragment into a number of subsequent genres: darkcore (piano rolls giving way to dark-themed samples and stabs), hardcore jungle (where reggae basslines and samples became prominent), and happy hardcore (retaining piano rolls and more uplifting vocals).\n2000s: revival.\nIn the 2000s, the style experienced a revival as part of the nu-rave scene in hardcore breaks. Hardcore breaks is inspired by the sound and characteristics of breakbeat hardcore, while being fused with modern production techniques that distinguish the genre from the classic hardcore breakbeat sound. The music is composed of looped, edited and processed breakbeat samples, intense bassline sounds, melodic piano lines, staccato synthesizer riffs, and various vocal samples (mostly taken from old house records). The speed of this genre typically fell between the range of 145\u2013155 bpm, while the speed may variate on live sets. Originally being produced by a small group of artists with the vision of carrying on where oldskool hardcore left off before the jungle and happy hardcore split using new production techniques and technology, its appeal has now expanded to include artists from the original breakbeat hardcore scene creating new productions. By the late 2000s, hardcore breaks tend to be produced and played at a bit faster tempos, often between 160\u2013180 bpm. Therefore, it is often played at UK hardcore, freeform hardcore and drum and bass events.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was Air Officer Commanding RAF Fighter Command during the Battle of Britain and is generally credited with playing a crucial role in Britain's defence, and hence, the defeat of Operation Sea Lion, Adolf Hitler's plan to invade Britain.\nBorn in Moffat, Scotland, Dowding was an officer in the British Army in the 1900s and early 1910s. He joined the Royal Flying Corps at the start of the First World War and went on to serve as a fighter pilot and then as commanding officer of No. 16 Squadron. During the inter-war years he became Air Officer Commanding Fighting Area, Air Defence of Great Britain and then joined the Air Council as Air Member for Supply and Research. In July 1936, Dowding was appointed chief of the newly created RAF Fighter Command.\nDuring the Battle of Britain in the Second World War, Dowding's Fighter Command successfully defended the UK against the attacks of the Luftwaffe, thanks to his prudent management of RAF resources and detailed preparation of Britain's air defences (the Dowding system). He subsequently came into conflict with proponents of the Big Wing tactic, most notably Trafford Leigh-Mallory and Douglas Bader, which along with the inadequacies of RAF's night-time defence during the Blitz led to his eventual downfall. In November 1940, Dowding was replaced in command against his wishes by Sholto Douglas, another Big Wing advocate.\nAfter further appointments in the US and then back to the UK, Dowding retired from the Royal Air Force in July 1942, He was made a peer in June 1943.\nDowding subsequently became an influential member of the British spiritualist, theosophical, and animal rights movements.\nHe died on 15 February 1970, aged 87.\nEarly life.\nDowding was born at St. Ninian's Boys' Preparatory School in Moffat, Dumfriesshire, the son of Arthur John Caswall Dowding and Maud Caroline Dowding (n\u00e9e Tremenheere). His father had taught at Fettes College in Edinburgh before moving to Moffat. Dowding was educated at St Ninian's School and Winchester College. He trained at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich before being commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Garrison Artillery on 18 August 1900.\nMilitary career.\nPromoted to lieutenant on 8 May 1902, Dowding served with the Royal Garrison Artillery at Gibraltar, in Ceylon and in Hong Kong before being posted to No. 7 Mountain Artillery Battery in India in 1904. In September 1907 he was seconded for service with the Native Mountain Artillery in India. After returning to the United Kingdom, he attended the Army Staff College 1912 before being promoted to captain on 18 August 1913 and being posted with the Royal Garrison Artillery on the Isle of Wight later that year. After becoming interested in aviation, Dowding gained Aviator's Certificate no. 711 on 19 December 1913 in a Vickers biplane at the Vickers School of Flying, Brooklands. He then attended the Central Flying School, where he was awarded his wings. Although added to the Reserve List of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC), Dowding returned to the Isle of Wight to resume his Royal Garrison Artillery duties. However, this arrangement was short lived and in August 1914, he joined the RFC as a pilot on No. 7 Squadron.\nFirst World War.\nDowding transferred to No. 6 Squadron in October 1914 and then, after two weeks as a staff officer in France, became a Flight Commander, first with No. 9 Squadron and then with No. 6 Squadron. He served from December 1914 as a general staff officer, grade 3 and was seconded. He became commanding officer of the Wireless Experimental Establishment at Brooklands in March 1915 and went on to be commanding officer of No. 16 Squadron in July 1915, which was based at La Gorgue in northern France. After the Battle of the Somme, Dowding clashed with General Hugh Trenchard, the commander of the RFC, over the need to give pilots some rest and recuperation. In September 1915 Duncan Grinnell-Milne joined No 16 squadron as a junior pilot. Years later he published an account of his time in the squadron, in which he criticises Dowding as being \"too reserved and aloof from his juniors\", although efficient. Promoted to major on 30 December 1915, Dowding was recalled to England in January 1916, and, having been promoted to temporary lieutenant colonel on 1 February 1916 was given command of 7 Wing at Farnborough later that month. He transferred to the command of 9 Wing at Fienvillers in June 1916. Returning to England, he was promoted to temporary colonel on 1 January 1917 on appointment as commander of the Southern Group Command and promoted to temporary brigadier-general on 23 June 1917 before being given command of the southern training brigade in August 1917. He was sent to York as chief staff officer to the RAF's senior administrative officer in the area in April 1918. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George on 1 January 1919.\nInter-war years.\nDowding was given a permanent commission in the RAF on 1 August 1919 with the rank of group captain. He commanded No. 16 Group from October 1919 and then No. 1 Group from February 1920 where he was responsible for organising two of the annual air displays at Hendon. He was promoted to air commodore on 1 January 1922, and served as chief staff officer at Inland Area headquarters at Uxbridge from February 1922 before being appointed Chief Staff Officer for RAF Iraq Command in August 1924.\nDowding was an accomplished skier, winner of the first ever National Slalom Championship, and president of the Ski Club of Great Britain from 1924 to 1925. The dominant personality within the RAF in the 1920s was Hugh Trenchard who ardently believed in strategic bombing as a war-winning measure and as a result, the interwar RAF was dominated by a \"bomber cult\" as Trenchard tended to promote officers who shared his views about strategic bombing. Dowding stood out as one of the few RAF officers not totally englamoured with bombers and who was more interested in fighters.\nIn May 1926 Dowding was appointed director of training at the Air Ministry. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 2 January 1928 and promoted to air vice-marshal on 1 January 1929. Trenchard sent him to Palestine and Transjordan to study security problems caused by Arab\u2013Jewish unrest: his reports, which gained Trenchard's approval, were a cause of further career advancement. Dowding became Air Officer Commanding Fighting Area, Air Defence of Great Britain in December 1929 and then joined the Air Council as Air Member for Supply and Research in September 1930. One of his first responsibilities in this post was the approval of the granting of a certificate of airworthiness to the R101 airship shortly before it set off on its ill-fated voyage to India; he later said \"I think I was wrong not to insist on much more extensive trials and tests\" and that his decision had been based on optimistic technical advice. Dowding's time in this office coincided with a period of rapid development in aircraft design and a growing fear that another major war was on the horizon. Although without scientific or technical training, he displayed a great capacity for understanding technical matters. He was promoted to air marshal on 1 January 1933 and advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 3 June 1933.\nIn July 1936 Dowding was appointed commanding officer of the newly created RAF Fighter Command, and was perhaps the one important person in Britain, and perhaps the world, who did not agree with British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin's 1932 declaration that \"The bomber will always get through\". He conceived and oversaw the development of the \"Dowding system\". This consisted of an integrated air defence system which included (i) radar (whose potential Dowding was among the first to appreciate), (ii) human observers (including the Royal Observer Corps), who filled crucial gaps in what radar was capable of detecting at the time (the early radar systems, for example, did not provide accurate information on the altitude of incoming German aircraft), (iii) raid plotting, and (iv) radio control of aircraft. The whole network was linked in many cases by dedicated telephone cables buried sufficiently deeply to provide protection against bombing. The network had its centre at RAF Bentley Priory, a converted country house on the outskirts of London. The system as a whole later became known as Ground-controlled interception (GCI).\nA major problem for the RAF was the way that the Canadian prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King from 1935 onward repeatedly vetoed plans for the Empire Air Training Scheme for training pilots from all the Commonwealth nations in Canada, which prevented Fighter Command from building up a reserve of properly trained pilots. By the time the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan was finally launched in the autumn of 1939 after Mackenzie King gave his consent, it was far too late for Dowding. On an average, it took about one year to train a pilot plus another year of squadron flying to prepare a pilot for war. In lieu of the Empire Air Training Scheme that he wanted, Dowding was forced to depend upon the Auxiliary Air Force, the RAF Volunteer Reserve and the University Air Squadrons to provide him with a reserve of trained pilots. However, despite all the efforts to give Fighter Command a reserve of pilots, Dowding complained in 1939 that he lacked sufficient reserves of properly trained pilots to face the Luftwaffe. On the basis of the First World War experiences, Dowding predicated that many of his pilots would be rapidly killed or seriously injured in the event of war, all the more because the Luftwaffe had many combat-experienced pilots who had served in the Spanish Civil War, and it still took a year to train a pilot, leading him to warn that he would almost certainly face a shortage of pilots.\nDowding also brought modern aircraft into service during the pre-war period, including the eight gun Spitfire and Hurricane. He is also credited with having fought the Air Ministry so that fighters were equipped with bullet-proof wind shields. At a meeting with the Air Ministry when told that bullet-proof windows were too expensive, Dowding replied: \"If Chicago gangsters can have bulletproof glass in their cars I can't see any reason why my pilots cannot have the same\". Dowding was a quiet, reserved man, but was greatly admired by those who served under him. He was promoted to air chief marshal on 1 January 1937 and appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order on 23 January 1937.\nSecond World War.\nBattle of Britain.\nAt the time of his retirement in June 1939, Dowding was asked to stay on until March 1940 because of the tense international situation. He was again permitted to continue serving through the Battle of Britain, first until July and finally until November 1940. In 1940, Dowding, nicknamed \"Stuffy\" by his men for his alleged lack of humour, proved unwilling to sacrifice aircraft and pilots in the attempt to aid Allied troops during the Battle of France. He, along with his immediate superior Sir Cyril Newall, then Chief of the Air Staff, resisted repeated requests from Winston Churchill to weaken the home defence by sending precious squadrons to France.\nDowding lacked tact when it came to dealing with politicians, and right from the onset he did not get along well with Churchill. The British historian Len Deighton wrote: \"But Dowding was no paragon. Too often he resorted to caustic comments when a kind word of advice would have produced the same or better results...Dowding was indifferent to the boardroom politics of higher office, impatient and abrasive to men who failed to understand his reasoning\". Just before a cabinet meeting on 15 May 1940, Dowding protested before an informal committee that consisted of Churchill; the minister of aircraft production, Lord Beaverbrook and the Air Minister Sir Archibald Sinclair that the number of fighter squadrons available to Fighter Command had been reduced from 52 to 36, and at present rate of losses in France, he would have no squadrons available within two weeks. Dowding attended the subsequent cabinet meeting, but did not speak. The meeting ended with the cabinet voting to send four more squadrons to France. On 16 May 1940, Churchill held a summit In Paris with the French Premier Paul Reynaud, and telephoned London afterwards to ask for six more fighter squadrons to be sent to France. At a cabinet meeting late in the afternoon of the same day, Sinclair mentioned Dowding's argument, which led to the cabinet to agree that the additional six squadrons could operate from French airfields in the day, but had to return to the United Kingdom at night. Churchill was angered by the way that Dowding's arguments had swayed the cabinet into a decision that he did not want and came to feel a grudge against Dowding. In a clear sign of disfavour, Churchill barely mentioned Dowding in \"Their Finest Hour\", volume 2 of his memoirs/history of the Second World, and in the few times that he did, he gave distorted accounts that cast Dowding in a dark light. In \"Their Finest Hour\", Churchill wrote: \"Air Chief Marshal Dowding, at the head of the metropolitan Fighter Command, had declared to me that with twenty-five squadrons of fighters he could defend the island against the whole of the German Air Force, but that with less he would be overpowered\". Deighton wrote that this statement was \"nonsense\" as Dowding in a letter to Churchill dated 15 May 1940 had expressed grave concerns about the ability of Fighter Command to hold out against the Luftwaffe with only thirty-six squadrons. When the Allied resistance in France collapsed, he worked closely with Air Vice-Marshal Keith Park, the commander of 11 Fighter Group, in organising cover for the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force at Dunkirk.\nThrough the summer and autumn of 1940 in the Battle of Britain, Dowding's Fighter Command resisted the attacks of the Luftwaffe. Beyond the critical importance of the overall system of integrated air defence which he had developed for Fighter Command, his major contribution was to marshal resources behind the scenes (including replacement aircraft and air crew) and to maintain a significant fighter reserve, while leaving his subordinate commanders' hands largely free to run the battle in detail. The first phase of the Battle of Britain, namely Luftwaffe attacks on British shipping in the English Channel were what Deighton called a classic \"heads I win, tails you lose\" gambit. If Dowding committed his fighters at the near-range of German aircraft, he risked having the strength of Fighter Command reduced via attrition while he did not think the Luftwaffe would sink the merchantmen. Because of a shortage of pilots, Dowding only committed the minimal number of fighters during what the Germans called the \"Kanalkampf\" (Channel battle), which led to increased shipping losses in July\u2013August 1940. He was forced to commit more fighter squadrons close to the coast even though he knew it was highly dangerous. The Luftwaffe planes were already flying at the optimal height over the Channel while it took time for the British fighters taking off at coastal airfields to reach the proper flying height, which thereby gave the Luftwaffe the advantage in any dogfights over the Channel. An additional concern for Dowding was that the planes of Fighter Command had no dinghies or sea dye while Britain at this point lacked an air-sea rescue organisation, so that any pilot shot down over the Channel were more likely than not to be lost. As more colliers were sunk in the Channel while Fighter Command losses increased, Dowding stoutly resisted pressure to send more fighters in the \"Kanalkampf\" and instead urged that more trains be used to move coal from Wales to London. By end of July 1940, Fighter Command had lost 145 aircraft in the \"Kanalkampf\". Dowding had an influential patron in the form of Lord Beaverbrook, who became fond of him, all the more so because the civil servants of the Air Ministry disliked Dowding. On a more personal note, Beaverbrook's son, Maxwell Aitken, was serving in Fighter Command and Beaverbrook decided that Dowding with his concern for the lives of his pilots was the best man to keep his son alive.\nBritish aircraft production continued at a brisk rate and it was the loss of pilots that was most concerning to Dowding. It took nearly a year to train a pilot to properly fly an aircraft, and the losses of pilots in the Battle of Britain imposed immense strain on Fighter Command, all the more so because the remaining pilots were forced to fly more to replace those killed or wounded. The majority of the 3,000 pilots under Dowding's command, namely 80% were British, but the fighter squadrons sent from the Commonwealth along with squadrons of emigres from Poland, Czechoslovakia, France, and Belgium were greatly appreciated to help ease the strain imposed by Fighter Command's losses. In early August 1940, Dowding learned via Ultra intelligence that the Luftwaffe was preparing for \"Adlertag\" (Eagle Day) set for 13 August 1940, which was intended to be a series of aerial attacks to win command of the sky. Eagle Day failed to achieve its stated goals as Fighter Command lost 34 planes in aerial combat while another 16 destroyed on the ground while shooting down 75 German planes. Eagle Day came to be known in the Luftwaffe as \"der schwarze Donnerstag\"\" (\"the black Thursday\") owing to the heavy losses taken. During the fighting on Eagle Day, Dowding observed that the Luftwaffe bombers were no match for the Spitfires and Hurricanes, and that German bombers could only operate in the day with the escort of Bf-109 fighters. As the Bf-109 fighters could only fly over south-eastern England owing to their fuel ranges, it was possible to move RAF fighters to airfields out of range for the Bf-109s, which provided a respite of sorts for Fighter Command. Dowding noted that the grim irony that the more successful Fighter Command was at shooting down Luftwaffe bombers during the day, the more likely it was that the Luftwaffe would switch over to bombing by night, a course that Fighter Command was not prepared for. It was also during Eagle Day that Trafford Leigh-Mallory, the GOC of 12 Group, started to become increasing vocal in expressing criticism of Park for not adopting his favoured \"big wing\" tactics of forming up a large wing of fighters as Park much preferred to send in fighters in looser, informal small groups. Leigh-Mallory also started to attack Dowding for not imposing the \"big wing\" tactics upon all of Fighter Command. The requirement that not all of Fighter Command's planes be on the ground being fuelled and armed led Dowding to commit small groups to attack the Luftwaffe bombers and their fighter escorts in waves. It was during the summer of 1940 that Dowding first learned of the \"Knickebein\" (literally \"dog-leg\") radio beam system, which guided Luftwaffe bombers to their targets during the night. The British called the \"Knickebein\" radio guidance system \"headache\" and called their electronic jamming countermeasures \"aspirins\". Owing to the threat posed by bombers guided by the \"Knickebein\" radio beams, Dowding ordered that electronic jamming of the radio beams be made a priority.\nBy late August 1940, Dowding was seriously concerned about Fighter Command's losses along with a decline in pilot quality as the RAF was forced to transfer pilots from Bomber Command and Coastal Command to Fighter Command and training was degraded to allow more pilots to graduate on a shortened training course. The great advantage for Fighter Command in August 1940 was that Dowding rotated his fighter squadrons to give his pilots a rest while the opposing German commanders, Albert Kesselring and Hugo Sperrle, did not. On 1 September 1940, Dowding realised that the losses taken during the fighting in July\u2013August 1940 was such that there were no more squadrons to rotate into the area of 11 Group of Fighter Command, which always endured the most heavy fighting. That day, Dowding took what he called \"a desperate expedient\" of breaking the squadrons into A, B and C types. The A type squadrons stationed in 11 Group were to continue to defend south-eastern England; the B type squadrons in 10 and 12 Groups were to relieve the A squadrons and the C type squadrons stationed elsewhere were to serve as training units, feeding new pilots into the A squadrons as needed. On 3 September 1940, Dowding reported to Churchill that 25% of all Fighter Command's pilots had been lost since the beginning of the Battle of Britain on top of the losses taken in France in the spring, and at current rate of losses Fighter Command would not be able to last much longer. Dowding also noted that about a quarter of his pilots were new pilots who had just graduated from the Operational Training Units who had less than two weeks' flying experience. Hermann G\u00f6ring took personal charge of the Luftwaffe forces attacking Britain and on 7 September 1940 dispatched a huge force of 1,000 bombers to strike London. That day, Dowding was having a meeting with Park, when he learned via reports from radar operators of the bomber force heading towards London. During the fighting on 7 September, the \"Big Wing\" tactics favoured by Trafford Leigh-Mallory of 12 Group failed as it took too long to form up the \"big wing\" while Park's tactics proved superior as 11 Group actually met the Luftwaffe. On 9 September 1940, G\u00f6ring dispatched another huge bombing raid on London, which met with fierce resistance from 11 Group. Deighton wrote: \"Park's handling of the fighting of 9 September was as brilliant as any in the war. Virtually none of the German bombers achieved hits on its primary target\".\nDowding received advance notice via Ultra intelligence of another large German raid scheduled for 15 September 1940. Park planned to attack the Luftwaffe both on its way to London and back, which forced his ground crews to work in record time to refuel and rearm his fighters as they landed after attacking the bombers on their way to London. The aerial battles on 15 September 1940 saw about 300 RAF fighters take on 400 Luftwaffe fighters. The Luftwaffe lost about 50 aircraft which convinced its commanders that Fighter Command possessed deeper reserves of pilots than what the RAF actually possessed. Churchill's speech on the radio that evening claimed: \"Aided by Czech and Polish squadrons and using only a small proportion of their total strength, the Royal Air Force cut to rags and tatters separate waves of murderous assault upon the civil population of their native land\". Fighter Command did not win command of the sky as the Luftwaffe continued to bomb Britain long after the battle of 15 September 1940, but the mere fact that Fighter Command had prevented the Luftwaffe from gaining command of the sky was sufficient to win the Battle of Britain. In an operational sense, Dowding had fought the Luftwaffe to a draw, but in strategical sense the battle was a British victory as the German invasion of Britain was strictly postulated on winning command of the sky first. On 17 September 1940, Hitler postponed Operation Sealion, the codename for the invasion of Britain, until \"further notice\".\nDowding was known for his humility and great sincerity. Fighter Command pilots came to characterise Dowding as one who cared for his men and had their best interests at heart. Dowding often referred to his \"dear fighter boys\" as his \"chicks\": indeed his son Derek was one of them. Because of his brilliant detailed preparation of Britain's air defences for the German assault, and his prudent management of his resources during the battle, Dowding is today generally given the credit for Britain's victory in the Battle of Britain.\nDowding's subsequent downfall has been attributed by some to his single-mindedness and perceived lack of diplomacy and political savoir faire in dealing with intra-RAF challenges and intrigues, most obviously the still, even now, hotly debated Big Wing controversy in which a number of senior and active service officers had argued in favour of large set-piece air battles with the Luftwaffe as an alternative to Dowding's successful Fabian strategy. Another reason often cited for his removal, but characterised by some contemporary commentators more as a pretext, was the difficulty of countering German nighttime bombing raids on British cities.\nThe account of radar pioneer, E. G. Bowen in \"Radar Days\" (1987) rebuts the claim that Dowding's grasp of the problems of British night fighters was inadequate. He suggests that if Dowding had been left to follow his own path, the ultimately effective British response to night bombing (which depended completely on developments in air-borne radar) would have come somewhat sooner.\nDowding himself showed that he had a good grasp of night fighter defence and was planning a defence system against night bombing in a letter he wrote some time after the Battle of Britain. However, there was great political and public pressure during the Blitz for something to be done, and Fighter Command's existing resources without, as yet, airborne radar, proved woefully inadequate. A committee of enquiry chaired by Sir John Salmond produced a long list of recommendations to improve night air defence; when Dowding approved only some of them, his erstwhile supporters, Lord Beaverbrook and Churchill, decided that it was time for him to step down.\nOn 8 October 1940, Dowding was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath. Before the war, the leadership of the RAF was committed to winning the next war via strategical bombing, and it was an article of faith amongst the senior Air Marshals that it would be impossible for fighter aircraft to stop a bombing offensive. Deighton wrote that the RAF leadership \"acted more vindictively\" against Dowding and Park for winning the Battle of Britain than Hermann G\u00f6ring did with the defeated Luftwaffe generals largely because Dowding and Park had proven the Air Ministry wrong by defeating a strategical bombing offensive. Dowding and Park were summoned to meet what Beaverbrook called a gang of \"bloody Air Marshals\" who in a quasi-trial accused Dowding and Park of failure in the Battle of Britain. Both Trafford Leigh-Mallory and the fighter ace Douglas Bader argued at the meeting that the Big Wing tactics were superior to those practiced by Dowding and Park, who were effectively treated as if they had lost the Battle of Britain.\nDowding unwillingly relinquished command on 24 November 1940 and was replaced by Big Wing advocate Sholto Douglas. Churchill tried to soften the blow by putting him in charge of the British Air Mission to the United States, responsible for the procurement of new aircraft types.\nPublication of his book \"Twelve Legions of Angels\" was suppressed in November 1941. The British Government considered that it contained information which might be of use to the Germans. The book was finally published in 1946, soon after the war ended.\nMinistry of Aircraft Production.\nAfter leaving Fighter Command, Dowding was sent on special duty to the United States for the Ministry of Aircraft Production, but there he made himself unpopular with his outspokenness. On his return he headed a study into economies of RAF manpower before retiring from the Royal Air Force in July 1942. He was elevated to the peerage, as Baron Dowding of Bentley Priory on 2 June 1943.\nLater life.\nLater in life, because of his belief that he was unjustly treated by the RAF, Dowding became increasingly bitter. The RAF passed him over for promotion to Marshal of the Royal Air Force.\nHe approved Robert Wright's book \"Dowding and the Battle of Britain\", which argued that a conspiracy of Big Wing proponents, including Trafford Leigh-Mallory and Douglas Bader, had engineered his sacking from Fighter Command.\nIn 1951, Dowding laid the foundation stone of the Chapel of St George at RAF Biggin Hill, now London Biggin Hill Airport, in memory of fallen airmen.\nIn 1967, Dowding served as technical advisor in the film production of \"Battle of Britain\", a Harry Saltzman production, his character played by Laurence Olivier.\nDowding and his second wife Baroness Dowding were both anti-vivisectionists, and in 1973 Britain's National Anti-Vivisection Society founded the Lord Dowding Fund for Humane Research in his honour.\nSpiritualism.\nIn his retirement, Dowding became actively interested in spiritualism, both as a writer and speaker. His first book on the subject, \"Many Mansions\", was written in 1943, followed by \"Lychgate\" (1945), \"The Dark Star\" and \"God's Magic\". Rejecting conventional Christianity, he joined the Theosophical Society which advocated belief in reincarnation. He wrote of meeting dead \"RAF boys\" in his sleep \u2013 spirits who flew fighters from mountain-top runways made of light. Dowding became a vegetarian, based on his beliefs as a theosophist and spiritualist. Although he was a vegetarian, he believed that \"animals will be killed to satisfy human needs for many a long day to come\", and he made several appeals in the House of Lords for the humane killing of animals intended for food. He was also a member of the Fairy Investigation Society. Although he knew that people considered him a crank for his belief in fairies, Dowding believed that fairies \"are essential to the growth of plants and the welfare of the vegetable kingdom\".\nDeath.\nDowding died at his home in Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent, on 15 February 1970. His body was cremated and his ashes were placed below the \"Battle of Britain Memorial Window\" in the Royal Air Force chapel in Westminster Abbey. Dowding's son Derek (1919\u20131992) inherited the title of Baron Dowding.\nPersonal life.\nDowding married Clarice Maud Vancourt, the daughter of an officer in the Indian Army, on 16 February 1918. She had one child from a previous marriage, Marjorie Brenda Williams (1911\u20132003) and they had one child together, Derek Hugh Tremenheere (1919\u20131992). Clarice died in 1920, and Dowding's sister Hilda helped Dowding look after the two children.\nDowding married Muriel Whiting (n\u00e9e\u00a0Albino) on 25 September 1951; they had no children.\nLegacy.\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, H.D. wrote several novels, memoirs, and book-length poems about Dowding.\nPortrayals.\nDowding has been portrayed by:\nHonours and tributes.\nA statue of Dowding stands outside St Clement Danes church on the Strand, London. The inscription reads:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Air Chief Marshal Lord Dowding was commander-in-chief of Fighter Command, Royal Air Force, from its formation in 1936 until November 1940. He was thus responsible for the preparation for and the conduct of the Battle of Britain. With remarkable foresight, he ensured the equipment of his command with monoplane fighters, the Hurricane and the Spitfire. He was among the first to appreciate the vital importance of R.D.F. (radar) and an effective command and control system for his squadrons. They were ready when war came. In the preliminary stages of that war, he thoroughly trained his minimal forces and conserved them against strong political pressure to disperse and misuse them. His wise and prudent judgement and leadership helped to ensure victory against overwhelming odds and thus prevented the loss of the Battle of Britain and probably the whole war. To him, the people of Britain and of the Free World owe largely the way of life and the liberties they enjoy today.\nOther monuments to Dowding can be found in Station Park in Moffat, the town of his birth, and in Calverley Gardens in Tunbridge Wells where he died. The RAF Association in conjunction with the RAF Benevolent Fund, purchased his birthplace, the former St Ninian's School, Moffat; the building was renamed Dowding House and restored to provide sheltered housing for former members of the Royal Air Force or their dependents.\nThe Dowding Centre at the School of Aerospace Battle Management (formerly the School of Fighter Control) at RAF Boulmer is named after Dowding.\nA green ceramic commemorative plaque was unveiled at his former residence (1951\u20131967) in Darnley Drive, Southborough on 6 May 2012.\nDowding Place, Stanmore, the site of former RAF Stanmore Park is named after him.\nThe 1946-built Southern Railway Battle of Britain pacific (4-6-2) locomotive 21C152 was named \"Lord Dowding\" in his honour.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

With a diameter of , Callisto is roughly a third larger than Earth's Moon and orbits Jupiter on average at a distance of 1.883 million km, which is about five times further out than the Moon orbiting Earth. It is the outermost of the four large Galilean moons of Jupiter, which were discovered in 1610 with one of the first telescopes, and is today visible from Earth with common binoculars.\nThe surface of Callisto is the oldest and most heavily cratered in the Solar System. Its surface is completely covered with impact craters. It does not show any signatures of subsurface processes such as plate tectonics or volcanism, with no signs that geological activity in general has ever occurred, and is thought to have evolved predominantly under the influence of impacts. Prominent surface features include multi-ring structures, variously shaped impact craters, and chains of craters called \"catenae\" and associated scarps, ridges and deposits. At a small scale, the surface is varied and made up of small, sparkly frost deposits at the tips of high spots, surrounded by a low-lying, smooth blanket of dark material. This is thought to result from the sublimation-driven degradation of small landforms, which is supported by the general deficit of small impact craters and the presence of numerous small knobs, considered to be their remnants. The absolute ages of the landforms are not known.\nCallisto is composed of approximately equal amounts of rock and ice, with a density of about , the lowest density and surface gravity of Jupiter's major moons. Compounds detected spectroscopically on the surface include water ice, carbon dioxide, silicates and organic compounds. Investigation by the \"Galileo\" spacecraft revealed that Callisto may have a small silicate core and possibly a subsurface ocean of liquid water at depths greater than .\nIt is not in an orbital resonance like the three other Galilean satellites\u2014Io, Europa and Ganymede\u2014and is thus not appreciably tidally heated. Callisto's rotation is tidally locked to its orbit around Jupiter, so that it always faces the same direction, making Jupiter appear to hang directly overhead over its near-side. It is less affected by Jupiter's magnetosphere than the other inner satellites because of its more remote orbit, located just outside Jupiter's main radiation belt. Callisto is surrounded by an extremely thin atmosphere composed of carbon dioxide and probably molecular oxygen, as well as by a rather intense ionosphere. Callisto is thought to have formed by slow accretion from the disk of the gas and dust that surrounded Jupiter after its formation. Callisto's gradual accretion and the lack of tidal heating meant that not enough heat was available for rapid differentiation. The slow convection in the interior of Callisto, which commenced soon after formation, led to partial differentiation and possibly to the formation of a subsurface ocean at a depth of 100\u2013150\u00a0km and a small, rocky core.\nThe likely presence of an ocean within Callisto leaves open the possibility that it could harbor life. However, conditions are thought to be less favorable than on nearby Europa. Various space probes from \"Pioneers 10\" and \"11\" to \"Galileo\" and \"Cassini\" have studied Callisto. Because of its low radiation levels, Callisto has long been considered the most suitable to base possible future crewed missions on to study the Jovian system.\nHistory.\nDiscovery.\nCallisto was discovered independently by Simon Marius and Galileo Galilei in 1610, along with the three other large Jovian moons\u2014Ganymede, Io and Europa.\nName.\nCallisto, like all of Jupiter's moons, is named after one of Zeus's many lovers or other sexual partners in Greek mythology. Callisto was a nymph (or, according to some sources, the daughter of Lycaon) who was associated with the goddess of the hunt, Artemis. The name was suggested by Simon Marius soon after Callisto's discovery. Marius attributed the suggestion to Johannes Kepler.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHowever, the names of the Galilean satellites fell into disfavor for a considerable time, and were not revived in common use until the mid-20th century. In much of the earlier astronomical literature, Callisto is referred to by its Roman numeral designation, a system introduced by Galileo, as Jupiter IV or as \"the fourth satellite of Jupiter\".\nThere is no established English adjectival form of the name. The adjectival form of Greek \u039a\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u1ff4 \"Kallist\u014di\" is \u039a\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u1ff4\u03bf\u03c2 \"Kallist\u014di-os\", from which one might expect Latin \"Callist\u014dius\" and English *Callist\u00f3ian (with 5 syllables), parallel to Sapph\u00f3ian (4 syllables) for \"Sapph\u014di\" and Let\u00f3ian for \"L\u0113t\u014di\". However, the iota subscript is often omitted from such Greek names (cf. \"In\u00f3an\" from \"\u012an\u014di\" and \"Arg\u00f3an\" from \"Arg\u014di\"), and indeed the analogous form Callistoan is found.\nIn Virgil, a second oblique stem appears in Latin: \"Callist\u014dn-,\" but the corresponding Callistonian has rarely appeared in English. One also sees \"ad hoc\" forms, such as Callistan, Callistian and Callistean.\nPlanetary moons other than Earth's were never given symbols in the astronomical literature. Denis Moskowitz, a software engineer who designed most of the dwarf planet symbols, proposed a Greek kappa (the initial of Callisto) combined with the cross-bar of the Jupiter symbol as the symbol of Callisto (). This symbol is not widely used.\nOrbit and rotation.\nCallisto is the outermost of the four Galilean moons of Jupiter. It orbits at a distance of approximately 1.88 million\u00a0km (26.3 times the 71,492\u00a0km radius of Jupiter itself). This is significantly larger than the orbital radius\u20141.07 million\u00a0km\u2014of the next-closest Galilean satellite, Ganymede. As a result of this relatively distant orbit, Callisto does not participate in any mean-motion resonance\u2014in which the three inner Galilean satellites are locked\u2014and probably never has. Callisto is expected to be captured into the resonance in about 1.5 billion years, completing the 1:2:4:8 chain.\nLike most other regular planetary moons, Callisto's rotation is locked to be synchronous with its orbit. The length of Callisto's day, simultaneously its orbital period, is about 16.7 Earth days. Its orbit is very slightly eccentric and inclined to the Jovian equator, with the eccentricity and inclination changing quasi-periodically due to solar and planetary gravitational perturbations on a timescale of centuries. The ranges of change are 0.0072\u20130.0076 and 0.20\u20130.60\u00b0, respectively. These orbital variations cause the axial tilt (the angle between the rotational and orbital axes) to vary between 0.4 and 1.6\u00b0.\nThe dynamical isolation of Callisto means that it has never been appreciably tidally heated, which has important consequences for its internal structure and evolution. Its distance from Jupiter also means that the charged-particle flux from Jupiter's magnetosphere at its surface is relatively low\u2014about 300 times lower than, for example, that at Europa. Hence, unlike the other Galilean moons, charged-particle irradiation has had a relatively minor effect on Callisto's surface. The radiation level at Callisto's surface is equivalent to a dose of about 0.01 rem (0.1 mSv) per day, which is just over ten times higher than Earth's average background radiation, but less than in Low Earth Orbit or on Mars.\nPhysical characteristics.\nComposition.\nThe average density of Callisto, 1.83\u00a0g/cm3, suggests a composition of approximately equal parts of rocky material and water ice, with some additional volatile ices such as ammonia. The mass fraction of ices is 49\u201355%. The exact composition of Callisto's rock component is not known, but is probably close to the composition of L/LL type ordinary chondrites, which are characterized by less total iron, less metallic iron and more iron oxide than H chondrites. The weight ratio of iron to silicon is 0.9\u20131.3 in Callisto, whereas the solar ratio is around 1:8.\nCallisto's surface has an albedo of about 20%. Its surface composition is thought to be broadly similar to its composition as a whole. Near-infrared spectroscopy has revealed the presence of water ice absorption bands at wavelengths of 1.04, 1.25, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 micrometers. Water ice seems to be ubiquitous on the surface of Callisto, with a mass fraction of 25\u201350%. The analysis of high-resolution, near-infrared and UV spectra obtained by the \"Galileo\" spacecraft and from the ground has revealed various non-ice materials: magnesium- and iron-bearing hydrated silicates, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and possibly ammonia and various organic compounds. Spectral data indicate that Callisto's surface is extremely heterogeneous at the small scale. Small, bright patches of pure water ice are intermixed with patches of a rock\u2013ice mixture and extended dark areas made of a non-ice material.\nThe Callistoan surface is asymmetric: the leading hemisphere is darker than the trailing one. This is different from other Galilean satellites, where the reverse is true. The trailing hemisphere of Callisto appears to be enriched in carbon dioxide, whereas the leading hemisphere has more sulfur dioxide. Many fresh impact craters like Lofn also show enrichment in carbon dioxide. Overall, the chemical composition of the surface, especially in the dark areas, may be close to that seen on D-type asteroids, whose surfaces are made of carbonaceous material.\nInternal structure.\nCallisto's battered surface lies on top of a cold, stiff and icy lithosphere that is between 80 and 150\u00a0km thick. A salty ocean 150\u2013200\u00a0km deep may lie beneath the crust, indicated by studies of the magnetic fields around Jupiter and its moons. It was found that Callisto responds to Jupiter's varying background magnetic field like a perfectly conducting sphere; that is, the field cannot penetrate inside Callisto, suggesting a layer of highly conductive fluid within it with a thickness of at least 10\u00a0km. The existence of an ocean is more likely if water contains a small amount of ammonia or other antifreeze, up to 5% by weight. In this case the water-and-ice layer can be as thick as 250\u2013300\u00a0km. Failing an ocean, the icy lithosphere may be somewhat thicker, up to about 300\u00a0km.\nBeneath the lithosphere and putative ocean, Callisto's interior appears to be neither entirely uniform nor particularly variable. \"Galileo\" orbiter data (especially the dimensionless moment of inertia\u20140.3549\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0042\u2014determined during close flybys) suggest that, if Callisto is in hydrostatic equilibrium, its interior is composed of compressed rocks and ices, with the amount of rock increasing with depth due to partial settling of its constituents. In other words, Callisto may be only partially differentiated. The density and moment of inertia for an equilibrium Callisto are compatible with the existence of a small silicate core in the center of Callisto. The radius of any such core cannot exceed 600\u00a0km, and the density may lie between 3.1 and 3.6\u00a0g/cm3. In this case, Callisto's interior would be in stark contrast to that of Ganymede, which appears to be fully differentiated.\nHowever, a 2011 reanalysis of Galileo data suggests that Callisto is not in hydrostatic equilibrium. In that case, the gravity data may be more consistent with a more thoroughly differentiated Callisto with a hydrated silicate core.\nSurface features.\nThe ancient surface of Callisto is one of the most heavily cratered in the Solar System. In fact, the crater density is close to saturation: any new crater will tend to erase an older one. The large-scale geology is relatively simple; on Callisto there are no large mountains, volcanoes or other endogenic tectonic features. The impact craters and multi-ring structures\u2014together with associated fractures, scarps and deposits\u2014are the only large features to be found on the surface.\nCallisto's surface can be divided into several geologically different parts: cratered plains, light plains, bright and dark smooth plains, and various units associated with particular multi-ring structures and impact craters. The cratered plains make up most of the surface area and represent the ancient lithosphere, a mixture of ice and rocky material. The light plains include bright impact craters like Burr and Lofn, as well as the effaced remnants of old large craters called palimpsests, the central parts of multi-ring structures, and isolated patches in the cratered plains. These light plains are thought to be icy impact deposits. The bright, smooth plains make up a small fraction of Callisto's surface and are found in the ridge and trough zones of the Valhalla and Asgard formations and as isolated spots in the cratered plains. They were thought to be connected with endogenic activity, but the high-resolution \"Galileo\" images showed that the bright, smooth plains correlate with heavily fractured and knobby terrain and do not show any signs of resurfacing. The \"Galileo\" images also revealed small, dark, smooth areas with overall coverage less than 10,000\u00a0km2, which appear to embay the surrounding terrain. They are possible cryovolcanic deposits. Both the light and the various smooth plains are somewhat younger and less cratered than the background cratered plains.\nImpact crater diameters seen range from 0.1\u00a0km\u2014a limit defined by the imaging resolution\u2014to over 100\u00a0km, not counting the multi-ring structures. Small craters, with diameters less than 5\u00a0km, have simple bowl or flat-floored shapes. Those 5\u201340\u00a0km across usually have a central peak. Larger impact features, with diameters in the range 25\u2013100\u00a0km, have central pits instead of peaks, such as Tindr crater. The largest craters with diameters over 60\u00a0km can have central domes, which are thought to result from central tectonic uplift after an impact; examples include Doh and H\u00e1r craters. A small number of very large\u2014more than 100\u00a0km in diameter\u2014and bright impact craters show anomalous dome geometry. These are unusually shallow and may be a transitional landform to the multi-ring structures, as with the Lofn impact feature. Callisto's craters are generally shallower than those on the Moon.\nThe largest impact features on Callisto's surface are multi-ring basins. Two are enormous. Valhalla is the largest, with a bright central region 600\u00a0km in diameter, and rings extending as far as 1,800\u00a0km from the center (see figure). The second largest is Asgard, measuring about 1,600\u00a0km in diameter. Multi-ring structures probably originated as a result of a post-impact concentric fracturing of the lithosphere lying on a layer of soft or liquid material, possibly an ocean. The catenae\u2014for example Gomul Catena\u2014are long chains of impact craters lined up in straight lines across the surface. They were probably created by objects that were tidally disrupted as they passed close to Jupiter prior to the impact on Callisto, or by very oblique impacts. A historical example of a disruption was Comet Shoemaker\u2013Levy 9.\nAs mentioned above, small patches of pure water ice with an albedo as high as 80% are found on the surface of Callisto, surrounded by much darker material. High-resolution \"Galileo\" images showed the bright patches to be predominately located on elevated surface features: crater rims, scarps, ridges and knobs. They are likely to be thin water frost deposits. Dark material usually lies in the lowlands surrounding and mantling bright features and appears to be smooth. It often forms patches up to 5\u00a0km across within the crater floors and in the intercrater depressions.\nOn a sub-kilometer scale the surface of Callisto is more degraded than the surfaces of other icy Galilean moons. Typically there is a deficit of small impact craters with diameters less than 1\u00a0km as compared with, for instance, the dark plains on Ganymede. Instead of small craters, the almost ubiquitous surface features are small knobs and pits. The knobs are thought to represent remnants of crater rims degraded by an as-yet uncertain process. The most likely candidate process is the slow sublimation of ice, which is enabled by a temperature of up to 165\u00a0K, reached at a subsolar point. Such sublimation of water or other volatiles from the dirty ice that is the bedrock causes its decomposition. The non-ice remnants form debris avalanches descending from the slopes of the crater walls. Such avalanches are often observed near and inside impact craters and termed \"debris aprons\". Sometimes crater walls are cut by sinuous valley-like incisions called \"gullies\", which resemble certain Martian surface features. In the ice sublimation hypothesis, the low-lying dark material is interpreted as a blanket of primarily non-ice debris, which originated from the degraded rims of craters and has covered a predominantly icy bedrock.\nThe relative ages of the different surface units on Callisto can be determined from the density of impact craters on them. The older the surface, the denser the crater population. Absolute dating has not been carried out, but based on theoretical considerations, the cratered plains are thought to be ~4.5\u00a0billion years old, dating back almost to the formation of the Solar System. The ages of multi-ring structures and impact craters depend on chosen background cratering rates and are estimated by different authors to vary between 1 and 4\u00a0billion years.\nAtmosphere and ionosphere.\nCallisto has a very tenuous atmosphere composed of carbon dioxide and probably oxygen. It was detected by the \"Galileo\" Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) from its absorption feature near the wavelength 4.2\u00a0micrometers. The surface pressure is estimated to be 7.5 picobar (0.75 \u03bcPa) and particle density 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0108\u00a0cm\u22123. Because such a thin atmosphere would be lost in only about four years though atmospheric escape, it must be constantly replenished, possibly by slow sublimation of carbon dioxide ice from Callisto's icy crust, which would be compatible with the sublimation\u2013degradation hypothesis for the formation of the surface knobs.\nCallisto's ionosphere was first detected during \"Galileo\" flybys; its high electron density of 7\u201317\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104\u00a0cm\u22123 cannot be explained by the photoionization of the atmospheric carbon dioxide alone. Hence, it is suspected that the atmosphere of Callisto is actually dominated by molecular oxygen (in amounts 10\u2013100 times greater than CO2). However, oxygen has not yet been directly detected in the atmosphere of Callisto. Observations with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) placed an upper limit on its possible concentration in the atmosphere, based on lack of detection, which is still compatible with the ionospheric measurements. At the same time, HST was able to detect condensed oxygen trapped on the surface of Callisto.\nAtomic hydrogen has also been detected in Callisto's atmosphere via analysis of 2001 Hubble Space Telescope data. Spectral images taken on 15 and 24 December 2001 were re-examined, revealing a faint signal of scattered light that indicates a hydrogen corona. The observed brightness from the scattered sunlight in Callisto's hydrogen corona is approximately two times larger when the leading hemisphere is observed. This asymmetry may originate from a different hydrogen abundance in both the leading and trailing hemispheres. However, this hemispheric difference in Callisto's hydrogen corona brightness is likely to originate from the extinction of the signal in Earth's geocorona, which is greater when the trailing hemisphere is observed.\nOrigin and evolution.\nThe partial differentiation of Callisto (inferred e.g. from moment of inertia measurements) means that it has never been heated enough to melt its ice component. Therefore, the most favorable model of its formation is a slow accretion in the low-density Jovian subnebula\u2014a disk of the gas and dust that existed around Jupiter after its formation. Such a prolonged accretion stage would allow cooling to largely keep up with the heat accumulation caused by impacts, radioactive decay and contraction, thereby preventing melting and fast differentiation. The allowable timescale for the formation of Callisto lies then in the range 0.1\u00a0million\u201310\u00a0million years.\nThe further evolution of Callisto after accretion was determined by the balance of the radioactive heating, cooling through thermal conduction near the surface, and solid state or subsolidus convection in the interior. Details of the subsolidus convection in the ice is the main source of uncertainty in the models of all icy moons. It is known to develop when the temperature is sufficiently close to the melting point, due to the temperature dependence of ice viscosity. Subsolidus convection in icy bodies is a slow process with ice motions of the order of 1\u00a0centimeter per year, but is, in fact, a very effective cooling mechanism on long timescales. It is thought to proceed in the so-called stagnant lid regime, where a stiff, cold outer layer of Callisto conducts heat without convection, whereas the ice beneath it convects in the subsolidus regime. For Callisto, the outer conductive layer corresponds to the cold and rigid lithosphere with a thickness of about 100\u00a0km. Its presence would explain the lack of any signs of the endogenic activity on the Callistoan surface. The convection in the interior parts of Callisto may be layered, because under the high pressures found there, water ice exists in different crystalline phases beginning from the ice I on the surface to ice VII in the center. The early onset of subsolidus convection in the Callistoan interior could have prevented large-scale ice melting and any resulting differentiation that would have otherwise formed a large rocky core and icy mantle. Due to the convection process, however, very slow and partial separation and differentiation of rocks and ices inside Callisto has been proceeding on timescales of billions of years and may be continuing to this day.\nThe current understanding of the evolution of Callisto allows for the existence of a layer or \"ocean\" of liquid water in its interior. This is connected with the anomalous behavior of ice I phase's melting temperature, which decreases with pressure, achieving temperatures as low as 251\u00a0K at 2,070\u00a0bar (207\u00a0MPa). In all realistic models of Callisto the temperature in the layer between 100 and 200\u00a0km in depth is very close to, or exceeds slightly, this anomalous melting temperature. The presence of even small amounts of ammonia\u2014about 1\u20132% by weight\u2014almost guarantees the liquid's existence because ammonia would lower the melting temperature even further.\nAlthough Callisto is very similar in bulk properties to Ganymede, it apparently had a much simpler geological history. The surface appears to have been shaped mainly by impacts and other exogenic forces. Unlike neighboring Ganymede with its grooved terrain, there is little evidence of tectonic activity. Explanations that have been proposed for the contrasts in internal heating and consequent differentiation and geologic activity between Callisto and Ganymede include differences in formation conditions, the greater tidal heating experienced by Ganymede, and the more numerous and energetic impacts that would have been suffered by Ganymede during the Late Heavy Bombardment. The relatively simple geological history of Callisto provides planetary scientists with a reference point for comparison with other more active and complex worlds.\nHabitability.\nIt is speculated that there could be life in Callisto's subsurface ocean. Like Europa and Ganymede, as well as Saturn's moons Enceladus, Dione and Titan and Neptune's moon Triton, a possible subsurface ocean might be composed of salt water.\nIt is possible that halophiles could thrive in the ocean.\nAs with Europa and Ganymede, the idea has been raised that habitable conditions and even extraterrestrial microbial life may exist in the salty ocean under the Callistoan surface. However, the environmental conditions necessary for life appear to be less favorable on Callisto than on Europa. The principal reasons are the lack of contact with rocky material and the lower heat flux from the interior of Callisto. Callisto's ocean is heated only by radioactive decay, while Europa's is also heated by tidal energy, as it is much closer to Jupiter. It is thought that of all of Jupiter's moons, Europa has the greatest chance of supporting microbial life.\nExploration.\nPre spaceflight.\nLighter composition was suggested in 1923 by Harold Jeffreys, by Gustav Tammann in 1931, and in 1951 Jeffreys suggested water.\nSpace age.\nThe \"Pioneer 10\" and \"Pioneer 11\" Jupiter encounters in the early 1970s contributed little new information about Callisto in comparison with what was already known from Earth-based observations. The real breakthrough happened later with the \"Voyager 1\" and \"Voyager 2\" flybys in 1979. They imaged more than half of the Callistoan surface with a resolution of 1\u20132\u00a0km, and precisely measured its temperature, mass and shape. A second round of exploration lasted from 1994 to 2003, when the \"Galileo\" spacecraft had eight close encounters with Callisto, the last flyby during the C30 orbit in 2001 came as close as 138\u00a0km to the surface. The \"Galileo\" orbiter completed the global imaging of the surface and delivered a number of pictures with a resolution as high as 15\u00a0meters of selected areas of Callisto. In 2000, the \"Cassini\" spacecraft en route to Saturn acquired high-quality infrared spectra of the Galilean satellites including Callisto. In February\u2013March 2007, the \"New Horizons\" probe on its way to Pluto obtained new images and spectra of Callisto.\nFuture exploration.\nCallisto will be visited by three spacecraft in the near future.\nThe European Space Agency's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE), which launched on 14 April 2023, will perform 21 close flybys of Callisto between 2031 and 2034.\nNASA's Europa Clipper, which launched on 14 October 2024, will conduct nine close flybys of Callisto beginning in 2030.\nChina's CNSA Tianwen-4 is planned to launch to Jupiter around 2030 before entering orbit around Callisto.\nOld proposals.\nFormerly proposed for a launch in 2020, the Europa Jupiter System Mission (EJSM) was a joint NASA/ESA proposal for exploration of Jupiter's moons. In February 2009 it was announced that ESA/NASA had given this mission priority ahead of the Titan Saturn System Mission. At the time ESA's contribution still faced funding competition from other ESA projects. EJSM consisted of the NASA-led Jupiter Europa Orbiter, the ESA-led Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter and possibly a JAXA-led Jupiter Magnetospheric Orbiter.\nPotential crewed exploration and habitation.\nIn 2003 NASA conducted a conceptual study called Human Outer Planets Exploration (HOPE) regarding the future human exploration of the outer Solar System. The target chosen to consider in detail was Callisto.\nThe study proposed a possible surface base on Callisto that would produce rocket propellant for further exploration of the Solar System. Advantages of a base on Callisto include low radiation (due to its distance from Jupiter) and geological stability. Such a base could facilitate remote exploration of Europa, or be an ideal location for a Jovian system waystation servicing spacecraft heading farther into the outer Solar System, using a gravity assist from a close flyby of Jupiter after departing Callisto.\nIn December 2003, NASA reported that a crewed mission to Callisto might be possible in the 2040s.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is observable from Earth with common binoculars and is a planetary-mass moon, slightly smaller and less massive than Earth's Moon. Europa is an icy moon, and, of the three icy Galilean moons, the closest orbiting Jupiter. As a result, it exhibits a relatively young surface, driven by tidal heating.\nProbably having an iron\u2013nickel core, it consists mainly of silicate rock, with a water-ice shell. It has a very thin atmosphere, composed primarily of oxygen. Its geologically young white-beige surface is striated by light tan cracks and streaks, with very few impact craters. In addition to Earth-bound telescope observations, Europa has been examined by a succession of space-probe flybys, the first occurring in the early 1970s. In September 2022, the \"Juno\" spacecraft flew within about 320\u00a0km (200 miles) of Europa for a more recent close-up view.\nEuropa has the smoothest surface of any known solid object in the Solar System. The apparent youth and smoothness of the surface is due to a water ocean beneath the surface, which could conceivably harbor extraterrestrial life. The predominant model suggests that heat from tidal flexing causes the ocean to remain liquid and drives ice movement similar to plate tectonics, absorbing chemicals from the surface into the ocean below. Sea salt from a subsurface ocean may be coating some geological features on Europa, suggesting that the ocean is interacting with the sea floor. This may be important in determining whether Europa could be habitable. In addition, the Hubble Space Telescope detected water vapor plumes similar to those observed on Saturn's moon Enceladus, which are thought to be caused by erupting cryogeysers. In May 2018, astronomers provided supporting evidence of water plume activity on Europa, based on an updated analysis of data obtained from the \"Galileo\" space probe, which orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003. Such plume activity could help researchers in a search for life from the subsurface Europan ocean without having to land on the moon. In March 2024, astronomers reported that the surface of Europa may have much less oxygen than previously inferred.\nEuropa was discovered independently by Simon Marius and Galileo Galilei. Marius later named it after Europa, the Phoenician mother of King Minos of Crete and lover of Zeus, the Greek equivalent of the Roman god Jupiter.\nThe \"Galileo\" mission, launched in 1989, provides the bulk of current data on Europa. No spacecraft has yet landed on Europa, although there have been several proposed exploration missions. The European Space Agency's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) is a mission to Ganymede launched on 14 April 2023, that will include two flybys of Europa. NASA's Europa Clipper was launched on 14 October 2024.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDiscovery and naming.\nEuropa, along with Jupiter's three other large moons, Io, Ganymede, and Callisto, was discovered by Galileo Galilei on 8 January 1610, and possibly independently by Simon Marius. On 7 January, Galileo had observed Io and Europa together using a 20\u00d7-magnification refracting telescope at the University of Padua, but the low resolution could not separate the two objects. The following night, he saw Io and Europa for the first time as separate bodies.\nThe moon is the namesake of Europa, in Greek mythology the daughter of the Phoenician king of Tyre. Like all the Galilean satellites, Europa is named after a lover of Zeus, the Greek counterpart of Jupiter. Europa was courted by Zeus and became the queen of Crete. The naming scheme was suggested by Simon Marius, who attributed the proposal to Johannes Kepler:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe names fell out of favor for a considerable time and were not revived in general use until the mid-20th century. In much of the earlier astronomical literature, Europa is simply referred to by its Roman numeral designation as \"Jupiter II\" (a system also introduced by Galileo) or as the \"second satellite of Jupiter\". In 1892, the discovery of Amalthea, whose orbit lay closer to Jupiter than those of the Galilean moons, pushed Europa to the third position. The \"Voyager\" probes discovered three more inner satellites in 1979, so Europa is now counted as Jupiter's sixth satellite, though it is still referred to as Jupiter II.\nThe adjectival form has stabilized as \"Europan\".\nPlanetary moons other than Earth's were never given symbols in the astronomical literature. Denis Moskowitz, a software engineer who designed most of the dwarf planet symbols, proposed a Greek epsilon (the initial of Europa) combined with the cross-bar of the Jupiter symbol as the symbol of Europa (). This symbol is not widely used.\nOrbit and rotation.\nEuropa orbits Jupiter in roughly 3.55 days, with an orbital radius of about 670,900\u00a0km. With an orbital eccentricity of only 0.009, the orbit itself is nearly circular, and the orbital inclination relative to Jupiter's equatorial plane is small, at 0.470\u00b0. Like its fellow Galilean satellites, Europa is tidally locked to Jupiter, with one hemisphere of Europa constantly facing Jupiter. Because of this, there is a sub-Jovian point on Europa's surface, from which Jupiter would appear to hang directly overhead. Europa's prime meridian is a line passing through this point. Research suggests that tidal locking may not be full, as a non-synchronous rotation has been proposed: Europa spins faster than it orbits, or at least did so in the past. This suggests an asymmetry in internal mass distribution and that a layer of subsurface liquid separates the icy crust from the rocky interior.\nThe slight eccentricity of Europa's orbit, maintained by gravitational disturbances from the other Galileans, causes Europa's sub-Jovian point to oscillate around a mean position. As Europa comes slightly nearer to Jupiter, Jupiter's gravitational attraction increases, causing Europa to elongate towards and away from it. As Europa moves slightly away from Jupiter, Jupiter's gravitational force decreases, causing Europa to relax back into a more spherical shape, and creating tides in its ocean. The orbital eccentricity of Europa is continuously pumped by its mean-motion resonance with Io. Thus, the tidal flexing kneads Europa's interior and gives it a source of heat, possibly allowing its ocean to stay liquid while driving subsurface geological processes. The ultimate source of this energy is Jupiter's rotation, which is tapped by Io through the tides it raises on Jupiter and is transferred to Europa and Ganymede by the orbital resonance.\nAnalysis of the unique cracks lining Europa yielded evidence that it likely spun around a tilted axis at some point in time. If correct, this would explain many of Europa's features. Europa's immense network of crisscrossing cracks serves as a record of the stresses caused by massive tides in its global ocean. Europa's tilt could influence calculations of how much of its history is recorded in its frozen shell, how much heat is generated by tides in its ocean, and even how long the ocean has been liquid. Its ice layer must stretch to accommodate these changes. When there is too much stress, it cracks. A tilt in Europa's axis could suggest that its cracks may be much more recent than previously thought. The reason for this is that the direction of the spin pole may change by as much as a few degrees per day, completing one precession period over several months. A tilt could also affect estimates of the age of Europa's ocean. Tidal forces are thought to generate the heat that keeps Europa's ocean liquid, and a tilt in the spin axis would cause more heat to be generated by tidal forces. Such additional heat would have allowed the ocean to remain liquid for a longer time. However, it has not yet been determined when this hypothesized shift in the spin axis might have occurred.\nPhysical characteristics.\nEuropa is slightly smaller than the Earth's moon. At just over in diameter, it is the sixth-largest moon and fifteenth-largest object in the Solar System. It is the least massive of the Galilean satellites. Its bulk density suggests that it is similar in composition to terrestrial planets, being primarily composed of silicate rock.\nInternal structure.\nIt is estimated that Europa has an outer layer of water around thick \u2013 a part frozen as its crust and a part as a liquid ocean underneath the ice. Recent magnetic-field data from the \"Galileo\" orbiter showed that Europa has an induced magnetic field through interaction with Jupiter's, which suggests the presence of a subsurface conductive layer. This layer is likely to be a salty liquid-water ocean. Portions of the crust are estimated to have undergone a rotation of nearly 80\u00b0, nearly flipping over (see true polar wander), which would be unlikely if the ice were solidly attached to the mantle. Europa probably contains a metallic iron core.\nSubsurface ocean.\nThe scientific consensus is that a layer of liquid water exists beneath Europa's surface, and that heat from tidal flexing allows the subsurface ocean to remain liquid. Europa's surface temperature averages about at the equator and only at the poles, keeping Europa's icy crust as hard as granite. The first hints of a subsurface ocean came from theoretical considerations of tidal heating (a consequence of Europa's slightly eccentric orbit and orbital resonance with the other Galilean moons). \"Galileo\" imaging team members argue for the existence of a subsurface ocean from analysis of \"Voyager\" and \"Galileo\" images. The most dramatic example is \"chaos terrain\", a common feature on Europa's surface that some interpret as a region where the subsurface ocean has melted through the icy crust. This interpretation is controversial. Most geologists who have studied Europa favor what is commonly called the \"thick ice\" model, in which the ocean has rarely, if ever, directly interacted with the present surface. The best evidence for the thick-ice model is a study of Europa's large craters. The largest impact structures are surrounded by concentric rings and appear to be filled with relatively flat, fresh ice; based on this and on the calculated amount of heat generated by Europan tides, it is estimated that the outer crust of solid ice is approximately thick, including a ductile \"warm ice\" layer, which could mean that the liquid ocean underneath may be about deep. This leads to a volume of Europa's oceans of 3\u00d71018\u00a0m3, between two or three times the volume of Earth's oceans.\nThe thin-ice model suggests that Europa's ice shell may be only a few kilometers thick. However, most planetary scientists conclude that this model considers only those topmost layers of Europa's crust that behave elastically when affected by Jupiter's tides. One example is flexure analysis, in which Europa's crust is modeled as a plane or sphere weighted and flexed by a heavy load. Models such as this suggest the outer elastic portion of the ice crust could be as thin as . If the ice shell of Europa is really only a few kilometers thick, this \"thin ice\" model would mean that regular contact of the liquid interior with the surface could occur through open ridges, causing the formation of areas of chaotic terrain. Large impacts going fully through the ice crust would also be a way that the subsurface ocean could be exposed.\nComposition.\nThe \"Galileo\" orbiter found that Europa has a weak magnetic moment, which is induced by the varying part of the Jovian magnetic field. The field strength at the magnetic equator (about 120 nT) created by this magnetic moment is about one-sixth the strength of Ganymede's field and six times the value of Callisto's. The existence of the induced moment requires a layer of a highly electrically conductive material in Europa's interior. The most plausible candidate for this role is a large subsurface ocean of liquid saltwater.\nSince the \"Voyager\" spacecraft flew past Europa in 1979, scientists have worked to understand the composition of the reddish-brown material that coats fractures and other geologically youthful features on Europa's surface. Spectrographic evidence suggests that the darker, reddish streaks and features on Europa's surface may be rich in salts such as magnesium sulfate, deposited by evaporating water that emerged from within. Sulfuric acid hydrate is another possible explanation for the contaminant observed spectroscopically. In either case, because these materials are colorless or white when pure, some other material must also be present to account for the reddish color, and sulfur compounds are suspected.\nAnother hypothesis for the colored regions is that they are composed of abiotic organic compounds collectively called tholins. The morphology of Europa's impact craters and ridges is suggestive of fluidized material welling up from the fractures where pyrolysis and radiolysis take place. In order to generate colored tholins on Europa, there must be a source of materials (carbon, nitrogen, and water) and a source of energy to make the reactions occur. Impurities in the water ice crust of Europa are presumed both to emerge from the interior as cryovolcanic events that resurface the body, and to accumulate from space as interplanetary dust. Tholins bring important astrobiological implications, as they may play a role in prebiotic chemistry and abiogenesis.\nThe presence of sodium chloride in the internal ocean has been suggested by a 450\u00a0nm absorption feature, characteristic of irradiated NaCl crystals. It has been spotted in HST observations of the chaos regions and is presumed to be areas of recent subsurface upwelling. The subterranean ocean of Europa contains carbon and was observed on the surface ice as a concentration of carbon dioxide within Tara Regio, a geologically recently resurfaced terrain. JWST NIRSpec observations show that the northern hemisphere show crystalline water ice beneath the surface and amorphous ice dominating the surface. In the southern hemisphere regiones Tara and Powys, crystalline water ice dominates both the surface and the deeper layers. These two regiones likely experience ongoing thermal (re)crystallization, as the radiation near Jupiter causes particle amorphization at the top 10 microns over a period of less than 15 days.\nSources of heat.\nEuropa receives thermal energy from tidal heating, which occurs through the tidal friction and tidal flexing processes caused by tidal acceleration: orbital and rotational energy are dissipated as heat in the core of the moon, the internal ocean, and the ice crust.\nTidal friction.\nOcean tides are converted to heat by frictional losses in the oceans and their interaction with the solid bottom and with the top ice crust. In late 2008, it was suggested Jupiter may keep Europa's oceans warm by generating large planetary tidal waves on Europa because of its small but non-zero obliquity. This generates so-called Rossby waves that travel quite slowly, at just a few kilometers per day, but can generate significant kinetic energy. For the current axial tilt estimate of 0.1 degree, the resonance from Rossby waves would contain 7.3\u00d71018 J of kinetic energy, which is two thousand times larger than that of the flow excited by the dominant tidal forces. Dissipation of this energy could be the principal heat source of Europa's ocean.\nTidal flexing.\nTidal flexing kneads Europa's interior and ice shell, which becomes a source of heat. Depending on the amount of tilt, the heat generated by the ocean flow could be 100 to thousands of times greater than the heat generated by the flexing of Europa's rocky core in response to the gravitational pull from Jupiter and the other moons circling that planet. Europa's seafloor could be heated by the moon's constant flexing, driving hydrothermal activity similar to undersea volcanoes in Earth's oceans.\nExperiments and ice modeling published in 2016, indicate that tidal flexing dissipation can generate one order of magnitude more heat in Europa's ice than scientists had previously assumed. Their results indicate that most of the heat generated by the ice actually comes from the ice's crystalline structure (lattice) as a result of deformation, and not friction between the ice grains. The greater the deformation of the ice sheet, the more heat is generated.\nRadioactive decay.\nIn addition to tidal heating, the interior of Europa could also be heated by the decay of radioactive material (radiogenic heating) within the rocky mantle. But the models and values observed are one hundred times higher than those that could be produced by radiogenic heating alone, thus implying that tidal heating has a leading role in Europa.\nPlumes.\nThe Hubble Space Telescope acquired an image of Europa in 2012 that was interpreted to be a plume of water vapour erupting from near its south pole. The image suggests the plume may be high, or more than 20 times the height of Mt. Everest., though recent observations and modeling suggest that typical Europan plumes may be much smaller. It has been suggested that if plumes exist, they are episodic and likely to appear when Europa is at its farthest point from Jupiter, in agreement with tidal force modeling predictions. Additional imaging evidence from the Hubble Space Telescope was presented in September 2016.\nIn May 2018, astronomers provided supporting evidence of water plume activity on Europa, based on an updated critical analysis of data obtained from the \"Galileo\" space probe, which orbited Jupiter between 1995 and 2003. \"Galileo\" flew by Europa in 1997 within of the moon's surface and the researchers suggest it may have flown through a water plume. Such plume activity could help researchers in a search for life from the subsurface Europan ocean without having to land on the moon.\nThe tidal forces are about 1,000 times stronger than the Moon's effect on Earth. The only other moon in the Solar System exhibiting water vapor plumes is Enceladus. The estimated eruption rate at Europa is about 7000\u00a0kg/s compared to about 200\u00a0kg/s for the plumes of Enceladus. If confirmed, it would open the possibility of a flyby through the plume to obtain a sample to analyze \"in situ\". This would avoid having to use a lander to drill through kilometres of ice.\nIn November 2020, a study was published in the peer-reviewed scientific journal \"Geophysical Research Letters\" suggesting that the plumes may originate from water within the crust of Europa as opposed to its subsurface ocean. The study's model, using images from the Galileo space probe, proposed that a combination of freezing and pressurization may result in at least some of the cryovolcanic activity. The pressure generated by migrating briny water pockets would thus, eventually, burst through the crust, thereby creating these plumes. The hypothesis that cryovolcanism on Europa could be triggered by freezing and pressurization of liquid pockets in the icy crust was first proposed by Sarah Fagents at the University of Hawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa, who in 2003, was the first to model and publish work on this process. A press release from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory referencing the November 2020 study suggested that plumes sourced from migrating liquid pockets could potentially be less hospitable to life. This is due to a lack of substantial energy for organisms to thrive off, unlike proposed hydrothermal vents on the subsurface ocean floor.\nIce shell and surface.\nEuropa is the smoothest known object in the Solar System, lacking large-scale features such as mountains and craters. The prominent markings crisscrossing Europa appear to be mainly albedo features that emphasize low topography. There are few craters on Europa, because its surface is tectonically too active and therefore young. The craters show the presence of hydrated salts dredged from the subsurface, but little sulfuric acid, indicating the impacts that formed them were very recent. Its icy crust has an albedo (light reflectivity) of 0.64, one of the highest of any moon. This indicates a young and active surface: based on estimates of the frequency of cometary bombardment that Europa experiences, the surface is about 20 to 180\u00a0million years old.\nIt has been postulated Europa's equator may be covered in icy spikes called penitentes, which may be up to 15\u00a0meters high. Their formation is due to direct overhead sunlight near the equator causing the ice to sublime, forming vertical cracks. Although the imaging available from the \"Galileo\" orbiter does not have the resolution for confirmation, radar and thermal data are consistent with this speculation.\nThe ionizing radiation level at Europa's surface is equivalent to a daily dose of about 5.4\u00a0Sv (540\u00a0rem), an amount that would cause severe illness or death in human beings exposed for a single Earth day (24 hours). A Europan day is about 3.5 times as long as an Earth day.\nLineae.\nEuropa's most striking surface features are a series of dark streaks crisscrossing the entire globe, called lineae (). Close examination shows that the edges of Europa's crust on either side of the cracks have moved relative to each other. The larger bands are more than across, often with dark, diffuse outer edges, regular striations, and a central band of lighter material.\nThe most likely hypothesis is that the lineae on Europa were produced by a series of eruptions of warm ice as Europa's crust slowly spreads open to expose warmer layers beneath. The effect would have been similar to that seen on Earth's oceanic ridges. These various fractures are thought to have been caused in large part by the tidal flexing exerted by Jupiter. Because Europa is tidally locked to Jupiter, and therefore always maintains approximately the same orientation towards Jupiter, the stress patterns should form a distinctive and predictable pattern. However, only the youngest of Europa's fractures conform to the predicted pattern; other fractures appear to occur at increasingly different orientations the older they are. This could be explained if Europa's surface rotates slightly faster than its interior, an effect that is possible due to the subsurface ocean mechanically decoupling Europa's surface from its rocky mantle and the effects of Jupiter's gravity tugging on Europa's outer ice crust. Comparisons of \"Voyager\" and \"Galileo\" spacecraft photos serve to put an upper limit on this hypothetical slippage. A full revolution of the outer rigid shell relative to the interior of Europa takes at least 12,000 years. Studies of \"Voyager\" and \"Galileo\" images have revealed evidence of subduction on Europa's surface, suggesting that, just as the cracks are analogous to ocean ridges, so plates of icy crust analogous to tectonic plates on Earth are recycled into the molten interior. This evidence of both crustal spreading at bands and convergence at other sites suggests that Europa may have active plate tectonics, similar to Earth. However, the physics driving these plate tectonics are not likely to resemble those driving terrestrial plate tectonics, as the forces resisting potential Earth-like plate motions in Europa's crust are significantly stronger than the forces that could drive them.\nChaos and lenticulae.\nOther features present on Europa are circular and elliptical (Latin for \"freckles\"). Many are domes, some are pits and some are smooth, dark spots. Others have a jumbled or rough texture. The dome tops look like pieces of the older plains around them, suggesting that the domes formed when the plains were pushed up from below.\nOne hypothesis states that these lenticulae were formed by diapirs of warm ice rising up through the colder ice of the outer crust, much like magma chambers in Earth's crust. The smooth, dark spots could be formed by meltwater released when the warm ice breaks through the surface. The rough, jumbled lenticulae (called regions of \"chaos\"; for example, Conamara Chaos) would then be formed from many small fragments of crust, embedded in hummocky, dark material, appearing like icebergs in a frozen sea.\nAn alternative hypothesis suggests that lenticulae are actually small areas of chaos and that the claimed pits, spots and domes are artefacts resulting from the over-interpretation of early, low-resolution Galileo images. The implication is that the ice is too thin to support the convective diapir model of feature formation.\nIn November 2011, a team of researchers, including researchers at University of Texas at Austin, presented evidence suggesting that many \"chaos terrain\" features on Europa sit atop vast lakes of liquid water. These lakes would be entirely encased in Europa's icy outer shell and distinct from a liquid ocean thought to exist farther down beneath the ice shell. Full confirmation of the lakes' existence will require a space mission designed to probe the ice shell either physically or indirectly, e.g. using radar. Chaos features may also be a result of increased melting of the ice shell and deposition of marine ice at low latitudes as a result of heterogeneous heating.\nWork published by researchers from Williams College suggests that chaos terrain may represent sites where impacting comets penetrated through the ice crust and into an underlying ocean.\nAtmosphere.\nThe atmosphere of Europa can be categorized as thin and tenuous (often called an exosphere), primarily composed of oxygen and trace amounts of water vapor. However, this quantity of oxygen is produced in a non-biological manner. Given that Europa's surface is icy, and subsequently very cold; as solar ultraviolet radiation and charged particles (ions and electrons) from the Jovian magnetospheric environment collide with Europa's surface, water vapor is created and instantaneously separated into oxygen and hydrogen constituents. As it continues to move, the hydrogen is light enough to pass through the surface gravity of the atmosphere leaving behind only oxygen. The surface-bounded atmosphere forms through radiolysis, the dissociation of molecules through radiation. This accumulated oxygen atmosphere can get to a height of above the surface of Europa. Molecular oxygen is the densest component of the atmosphere because it has a long lifetime; after returning to the surface, it does not stick (freeze) like a water or hydrogen peroxide molecule but rather desorbs from the surface and starts another ballistic arc. Molecular hydrogen never reaches the surface, as it is light enough to escape Europa's surface gravity. Europa is one of the few moons in the Solar System with a quantifiable atmosphere, along with Titan, Io, Triton, Ganymede and Callisto. Europa is also one of several moons in the Solar System with very large quantities of ice (volatiles), otherwise known as \"icy moons\".Europa is also considered to be geologically active due to the constant release of hydrogen-oxygen mixtures into space. As a result of the moon's particle venting, the atmosphere requires continuous replenishment. Europa also contains a small magnetosphere (approximately 25% of Ganymede's). However, this magnetosphere varies in size as Europa orbits through Jupiter's magnetic field. This confirms that a conductive element, such as a large ocean, likely lies below its icy surface. As multiple studies have been conducted over Europa's atmosphere, several findings conclude that not all oxygen molecules are released into the atmosphere. This unknown percentage of oxygen may be absorbed into the surface and sink into the subsurface. Because the surface may interact with the subsurface ocean (considering the geological discussion above), this molecular oxygen may make its way to the ocean, where it could aid in biological processes. One estimate suggests that, given the turnover rate inferred from the apparent ~0.5\u00a0Gyr maximum age of Europa's surface ice, subduction of radiolytically generated oxidizing species might well lead to oceanic free oxygen concentrations that are comparable to those in terrestrial deep oceans.\nThrough the slow release of oxygen and hydrogen, a neutral torus around Europa's orbital plane is formed. This \"neutral cloud\" has been detected by both the \"Cassini\" and \"Galileo\" spacecraft, and has a greater content (number of atoms and molecules) than the neutral cloud surrounding Jupiter's inner moon Io. This torus was officially confirmed using Energetic Neutral Atom (ENA) imaging. Europa's torus ionizes through the process of neutral particles exchanging electrons with its charged particles. Since Europa's magnetic field rotates faster than its orbital velocity, these ions are left in the path of its magnetic field trajectory, forming a plasma. It has been hypothesized that these ions are responsible for the plasma within Jupiter's magnetosphere.\nOn 4 March 2024, astronomers reported that the surface of Europa may have much less oxygen than previously inferred.\nDiscovery of atmosphere.\nThe atmosphere of Europa was first discovered in 1995 by astronomers D. T. Hall and collaborators using the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph instrument of the Hubble Space Telescope. This observation was further supported in 1997 by the \"Galileo\" orbiter during its mission within the Jovian system. The \"Galileo\" orbiter performed three radio occultation events of Europa, where the probe's radio contact with Earth was temporarily blocked by passing behind Europa. By analyzing the effects Europa's sparse atmosphere had on the radio signal just before and after the occultation, for a total of six events, a team of astronomers led by A. J. Kliore established the presence of an ionized layer in Europa's atmosphere.\nClimate and weather.\nDespite the presence of a gas torus, Europa has no weather producing clouds. As a whole, Europa has no wind, precipitation, or presence of sky color as its gravity is too low to hold an atmosphere substantial enough for those features. Europa's gravity is approximately 13% of Earth's. The temperature on Europa varies from \u2212160\u00a0\u00b0C at the equator, to \u2212220\u00a0\u00b0C at either of its poles. Europa's subsurface ocean is thought to be significantly warmer however. It is hypothesized that because of radioactive and tidal heating (as mentioned in the sections above), there are points in the depths of Europa's ocean that may be only slightly cooler than Earth's oceans. Studies have also concluded that Europa's ocean would have been rather acidic at first, with large concentrations of sulfate, calcium, and carbon dioxide. But over the course of 4.5\u00a0billion years, it became full of chloride, thus resembling our 1.94% chloride oceans on Earth.\nExploration.\nGravitational calculations suggested by the start of 20th century that Europa's composition was water rich, and Earth ground based observations by Gerard Kuiper revealed 1957 the water ice composition.\nExploration of Europa began with the Jupiter flybys of \"Pioneer 10\" and \"11\" in 1973 and 1974, respectively. The first closeup photos were of low resolution compared to later missions. The two Voyager probes traveled through the Jovian system in 1979, providing more-detailed images of Europa's icy surface. The images caused many scientists to speculate about the possibility of a liquid ocean underneath. \nStarting in 1995, the \"Galileo\" space probe orbited Jupiter for eight years, until 2003, and provided the most detailed examination of the Galilean moons to date. It included the \"Galileo Europa Mission\" and \"Galileo Millennium Mission\", with numerous close flybys of Europa. In 2007, \"New Horizons\" imaged Europa, as it flew by the Jovian system while on its way to Pluto. In 2022, the \"Juno\" orbiter flew by Europa at a distance of 352\u00a0km (219\u00a0mi).\nIn 2012, \"Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer\" (JUICE) was selected by the European Space Agency (ESA) as a planned mission. That mission includes two flybys of Europa, but is more focused on Ganymede. It was launched in 2023, and is expected to reach Jupiter in July 2031 after four gravity assists and eight years of travel.\nIn 2011, a Europa mission was recommended by the U.S. Planetary Science Decadal Survey. In response, NASA commissioned concept studies of a Europa lander in 2011, along with concepts for a Europa flyby (\"Europa Clipper\"), and a Europa orbiter. The orbiter element option concentrates on the \"ocean\" science, while the multiple-flyby element (\"Clipper\") concentrates on the chemistry and energy science. On 13 January 2014, the House Appropriations Committee announced a new bipartisan bill that includes $80\u00a0million in funding to continue the Europa mission concept studies.\nIn July 2013 an updated concept for a flyby Europa mission called \"Europa Clipper\" was presented by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and the Applied Physics Laboratory (APL). In May 2015, NASA announced that it had accepted development of the \"Europa Clipper\" mission, and revealed the instruments it would use. The aim of \"Europa Clipper\" is to explore Europa in order to investigate its habitability, and to aid in selecting sites for a future lander. The \"Europa Clipper\" would not orbit Europa, but instead orbit Jupiter and conduct 45 low-altitude flybys of Europa during its envisioned mission. The probe would carry an ice-penetrating radar, short-wave infrared spectrometer, topographical imager, and an ion- and neutral-mass spectrometer. The mission was launched on 14 October 2024 aboard a Falcon Heavy.\nFuture missions.\nConjectures regarding extraterrestrial life have ensured a high profile for Europa and have led to steady lobbying for future missions. The aims of these missions have ranged from examining Europa's chemical composition to searching for extraterrestrial life in its hypothesized subsurface oceans. Robotic missions to Europa need to endure the high-radiation environment around Jupiter. Because it is deeply embedded within Jupiter's magnetosphere, Europa receives about 5.40\u00a0Sv of radiation per day.\nOld proposals.\nIn the early 2000s, \"Jupiter Europa Orbiter\" led by NASA and the \"Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter\" led by the ESA were proposed together as an Outer Planet Flagship Mission to Jupiter's icy moons called Europa Jupiter System Mission, with a planned launch in 2020. In 2009 it was given priority over \"Titan Saturn System Mission\". At that time, there was competition from other proposals. Japan proposed \"Jupiter Magnetospheric Orbiter\".\n\"Jovian Europa Orbiter\" was an ESA Cosmic Vision concept study from 2007. Another concept was \"Ice Clipper\", which would have used an impactor similar to the \"Deep Impact\" mission\u2014it would make a controlled crash into the surface of Europa, generating a plume of debris that would then be collected by a small spacecraft flying through the plume.\n\"Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter\" (JIMO) was a partially developed fission-powered spacecraft with ion thrusters that was cancelled in 2006. It was part of Project Prometheus. The \"Europa Lander Mission\" proposed a small nuclear-powered Europa lander for JIMO. It would travel with the orbiter, which would also function as a communication relay to Earth.\n\"Europa Orbiter\" \u2013 Its objective would be to characterize the extent of the ocean and its relation to the deeper interior. Instrument payload could include a radio subsystem, laser altimeter, magnetometer, Langmuir probe, and a mapping camera. The \"Europa Orbiter\" received the go-ahead in 1999 but was canceled in 2002. This orbiter featured a special ice-penetrating radar that would allow it to scan below the surface.\nMore ambitious ideas have been put forward including an impactor in combination with a thermal drill to search for biosignatures that might be frozen in the shallow subsurface.\nAnother proposal put forward in 2001 calls for a large nuclear-powered \"melt probe\" (cryobot) that would melt through the ice until it reached an ocean below. Once it reached the water, it would deploy an autonomous underwater vehicle (hydrobot) that would gather information and send it back to Earth. Both the cryobot and the hydrobot would have to undergo some form of extreme sterilization to prevent detection of Earth organisms instead of native life and to prevent contamination of the subsurface ocean. This suggested approach has not yet reached a formal conceptual planning stage.\nHabitability.\nSo far, there is no evidence that life exists on Europa, but the moon has emerged as one of the most likely locations in the Solar System for potential habitability. Life could exist in its under-ice ocean, perhaps in an environment similar to Earth's deep-ocean hydrothermal vents. Even if Europa lacks volcanic hydrothermal activity, a 2016 NASA study found that Earth-like levels of hydrogen and oxygen could be produced through processes related to serpentinization and ice-derived oxidants, which do not directly involve volcanism. In 2015, scientists announced that salt from a subsurface ocean may likely be coating some geological features on Europa, suggesting that the ocean is interacting with the seafloor. This may be important in determining if Europa could be habitable. The likely presence of liquid water in contact with Europa's rocky mantle has spurred calls to send a probe there.\nThe energy provided by tidal forces drives active geological processes within Europa's interior, just as they do to a far more obvious degree on its sister moon Io. Although Europa, like the Earth, may possess an internal energy source from radioactive decay, the energy generated by tidal flexing would be several orders of magnitude greater than any radiological source. Life on Europa could exist clustered around hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor, or below the ocean floor, where endoliths are known to inhabit on Earth. Alternatively, it could exist clinging to the lower surface of Europa's ice layer, much like algae and bacteria in Earth's polar regions, or float freely in Europa's ocean. Should Europa's oceans be too cold, biological processes similar to those known on Earth could not occur; too salty, only extreme halophiles could survive in that environment. In 2010, a model proposed by Richard Greenberg of the University of Arizona proposed that irradiation of ice on Europa's surface could saturate its crust with oxygen and peroxide, which could then be transported by tectonic processes into the interior ocean. Such a process could render Europa's ocean as oxygenated as our own within just 12\u00a0million years, allowing the existence of complex, multicellular lifeforms.\nEvidence suggests the existence of lakes of liquid water entirely encased in Europa's icy outer shell and distinct from a liquid ocean thought to exist farther down beneath the ice shell, as well as pockets of water that form M-shaped ice ridges when the water freezes on the surface \u2013 as in Greenland. If confirmed, the lakes and pockets of water could be yet another potential habitat for life. Evidence suggests that hydrogen peroxide is abundant across much of the surface of Europa. Because hydrogen peroxide decays into oxygen and water when combined with liquid water, the authors argue that it could be an important energy supply for simple life forms. Nonetheless, on 4 March 2024, astronomers reported that the surface of Europa may have much less oxygen than previously inferred.\nClay-like minerals (specifically, phyllosilicates), often associated with organic matter on Earth, have been detected on the icy crust of Europa. The presence of the minerals may have been the result of a collision with an asteroid or comet. Some scientists have speculated that life on Earth could have been blasted into space by asteroid collisions and arrived on the moons of Jupiter in a process called lithopanspermia.\nFuture.\nMost stars like the Sun at the end of their main sequence phase of their life will evolve into a red giant branch star. Then when they die they will shed their outer layers to become a white dwarf star. When the Sun goes through this in around 5 billion years, Europa will be drastically affected. The fate of Europa will be largely the same with the other Galilean moons of Jupiter and some of the moons of Saturn.\nWhen the habitable zone (HZ) of the Sun reaches to Europa, the heat from the red giant Sun will cause the ice on Europa to sublimate or melt, forming a temporary global ocean. The side of Europa facing Jupiter will sublimate much more than the side facing away from Jupiter. This will cause Europa to gain a tenuous atmosphere made of water vapor which will last for about 0.2 billion years until the habitable zone extends beyond Europa. This water will then be blasted away into space. However, while Europa still has its ocean, there is a possibility for life to evolve in that limited time, since life on Earth took around a couple hundred million years to evolve.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Sipuncula was once considered a phylum of unsegmented worms, but was demoted to a class of Annelida, based on recent molecular work.\nSipunculans vary in size but most species are under in length. The body is divided into an unsegmented, bulbous trunk and a narrower, anterior section, called the \"introvert\", which can be retracted into the trunk. The mouth is at the tip of the introvert and is surrounded in most groups by a ring of short tentacles. With no hard parts, the body is flexible and mobile. Although found in a range of habitats throughout the world's oceans, the majority of species live in shallow water habitats, burrowing under the surface of sandy and muddy substrates. Others live under stones, in rock crevices or in other concealed locations.\nMost sipunculans are deposit feeders, extending the introvert to gather food particles and draw them into the mouth, and retracting the introvert when feeding conditions are unsuitable or danger threatens. With a few exceptions, reproduction is sexual and involves a planktonic larval stage. Sipunculid worms are used as food in some countries in south-east Asia.\nTaxonomy.\n is a feminine variant of the now-obsolete genus name , itself a variant of the Latin (\"little tube\"), a diminutive of from Greek (, \"tube, pipe\").\nThe Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus first described the worm in his in 1767. In 1814, the French zoologist Constantine Samuel Rafinesque used the word \"Sipuncula\" to describe the family (now Sipunculidae), and in time, the term came to be used for the whole class. This is a relatively understudied group, and it is estimated there may be around 162 species worldwide.\nThe phylogenetic placement of this group in the past has proved troublesome. Originally classified as annelids, despite the complete lack of segmentation, bristles and other annelid characters, the phylum Sipuncula was later allied with the Mollusca, mostly on the basis of developmental and larval characters. These phyla have been included in a larger group, the Lophotrochozoa, that also includes the annelids, the ribbon worms and several other phyla. Phylogenetic analyses based on 79 ribosomal proteins indicated a position of Sipuncula within Annelida. Subsequent analysis of the mitochondrion's DNA has confirmed their close relationship to the Annelida (including echiurans and pogonophorans). It has also been shown that a rudimentary neural segmentation similar to that of annelids occurs in the early larval stage, even if these traits are absent in the adults.\nAnatomy.\nSipunculans are worms ranging from in length, with most species being under . The sipunculan body is divided into an unsegmented, bulbous trunk and a narrower, anterior section, called the \"introvert\". Sipunculans have a body wall somewhat similar to that of most other annelids (though unsegmented) in that it consists of an epidermis without cilia overlain by a cuticle, an outer layer of circular and an inner layer of longitudinal musculature. The body wall surrounds the coelom (body cavity) that is filled with fluid on which the body wall musculature acts as a hydrostatic skeleton to extend or contract the animal. When threatened, Sipunculid worms can contract their body into a shape resembling a peanut kernel\u2014a practice that has given rise to the name \"peanut worm\". The introvert is pulled inside the trunk by two pairs of retractor muscles that extend as narrow ribbons from the trunk wall to attachment points in the introvert. It can be protruded from the trunk by contracting the muscles of the trunk wall, thus forcing the fluid in the body cavity forwards. The introvert can vary in size from half the length of the trunk to several times its length, but whatever their comparative sizes, it is fully retractable.\nThe mouth is located at the anterior end of the animal; in the subclass Sipunculidea, the mouth is surrounded by a mass of 18 to 24 ciliated tentacles, while in the subclass Phascolosomatidea, the tentacles are arranged in an arc above the mouth, surrounding the nuchal organ, also located at the tip of the introvert. The tentacles each have a deep groove along which food is moved to the mouth by cilia. They are used to gather organic detritus from the water or substrate, and probably also function as gills. In the family Themistidae the tentacles form an elaborate crown-like structure, the members of this group being specialized filter feeders, unlike the other groups of sipunculans which are deposit feeders. The tentacles are hollow and are extended via hydrostatic pressure in a similar manner as the introvert, but have a different mechanism from that of the rest of the introvert, being connected, via a system of ducts, to one or two contractile sacs next to the oesophagus. Hooks are often present near the mouth on the introvert. These are proteinaceous, non-chitinous specializations of the epidermis, either arranged in rings or scattered. They may be involved in scraping algae off rock, or alternatively provide anchorage.\nThree genera (\"Aspidosiphon\", \"Lithacrosiphon\" and \"Cloeosiphon\") in the Aspidosiphonidae family possess epidermal structures, known as anal and caudal shields. These are patches of thickened, hard plates, and are used for boring into rock; the anal shield is near the anteriorly-located anus on the trunk, just below the introvert of the animal, while the caudal shield is at the posterior of the body. In \"Aspidosiphon\" and \"Lithacrosiphon\" the anal shield is restricted to the dorsal side, causing the introvert to emerge at an angle, whereas it surrounds the anterior trunk in \"Cloeosiphon\" with the introvert emerging from its center. In \"Aspidosiphon\" the shield is a hardened, horny structure; in \"Lithacrosiphon\" it is a calcareous cone; in \"Cloeosiphon\" it is composed of separate plates. When the introvert is retracted in these animals, the anal shield blocks the entrance to its burrow. At the posterior end of the trunk, a hardened caudal shield is sometimes present in \"Aspidosiphon\"; this may help with anchoring the animal in its burrow or may be used in the boring process.\nDigestive system.\nThe digestive tract of sipunculans starts with the esophagus, located between the introvert retractor muscles. In the trunk the intestine runs posteriorly, forms a loop and turns anteriorly again. The downward and upward sections of the gut are coiled around each other, forming a double helix. At the termination of the gut coil, the rectum emerges and ends in the anus, located in the anterior third of the trunk. Digestion is extra-cellular, taking place in the lumen of the intestine. A rectal caecum, present in most species, is a blind ending sac at the transition between intestine and rectum with unknown function. The anus is often not visible when the introvert is retracted into the trunk.\nCirculation.\nSipunculans do not have a vascular blood system. Fluid transport and gas exchange are instead accomplished by the coelom, which contains the respiratory pigment haemerythrin, and the separate tentacular system, the two being separated by an elaborate septum. The coelomic fluid contains five types of coelomic cells: haemocytes, granulocytes, large multinuclear cells, ciliated urn-shaped cells and immature cells. The ciliated urn cells may also be attached to the peritoneum and assist in waste filtering from the coelomic fluid. Nitrogenous waste is excreted through a pair of metanephridia opening close to the anus, except in \"Phascolion\" and \"Onchnesoma\", which have only a single nephridium. A ciliated funnel, or nephrostome, opens into the coelomic cavity at the anterior end, close to the nephridiopore. The metanephridia have an osmoregulation function but it is unclear whether the mechanism is via filtration or secretion. They also serve as gamete storage and maintenance organs.\nThe tentacular coelom connects the tentacles at the tip of the introvert to a ring canal at their base, from which a contractile vessel runs along beside the esophagus and ends blindly posteriorly. Some evidence points towards the involvement of these structures in ultrafiltration. In crevice-dwelling sipunculans, respiration is mainly through the tentacular system, with oxygen diffusing into the trunk coelom from the tentacular coelom. However, in other species the skin is thin and respiration is mainly through the cuticle of the trunk, where oxygen uptake is assisted by the presence of dermal coelomic canals just beneath the epidermis.\nNervous system.\nThe nervous system consists of dorsal cerebral ganglion, brain above the oesophagus and a nerve ring around the oesophagus, which links the brain with the single ventral nerve cord that runs the length of the body. Lateral nerves lead off this to innervate the muscles of the body wall.\nIn some species, there are simple light-sensitive ocelli associated with the brain. Two organs, likely functioning as a unit for chemoreception are located near its anterior margin; the non-ciliated cerebral organ, which possesses bipolar sensory cells, and the nuchal organ, located posterior to the brain. Similar light-sensing tubes have been reported in the fauveliopsid annelids. In addition, all sipunculans have numerous sensory nerve endings on the body wall, especially at the forward end of the introvert which is used for exploring the surrounding environment.\nDistribution and habitat.\nAll sipunculid worms are marine and benthic; they are found throughout the world's oceans including polar waters, equatorial waters and the abyssal zone, but the majority of species occur in shallow water, where they are relatively common. They inhabit a range of habitats including burrowing in sand, mud, clay and gravel, hiding under stones, in rock crevices, in hollow coral heads, in wood, in empty seashells and inside the bones of dead whales. Some hide in kelp holdfasts, under tangles of eelgrass, inside sponges and in the empty tubes of other organisms, and some live among fouling organisms on man-made structures. Some bore into solid rocks to make a shelter for themselves.\nThey are common below the surface of the sediment on tidal flats. These worms may stay submerged in the sea bed for between 10 and 18 hours a day. They are sensitive to low salinities, and thus not commonly found near estuaries. They can also be abundant in coralline rock, and in Hawaii, up to seven hundred individuals have been found per square metre in burrows in the rock.\nReproduction.\nBoth asexual and sexual reproduction can be found in sipunculans, although asexual reproduction is uncommon and has only been observed in \"Aspidosiphon elegans\" and \"Sipunculus robustus\". These reproduce asexually through transverse fission, followed by regeneration of vital body components, with \"S. robustus\" also reproducing by budding. One species of sipunculan, \"Themiste lageniformis\", has been recorded as reproducing parthenogenetically; eggs produced in the absence of sperm developed through the normal stages.\nMost sipunculan species are dioecious. Their gametes are produced in the coelomic lining, where they are released into the coelom to mature. These gametes are then picked up by the metanephridia system and released into the aquatic environment, where fertilisation takes place. In at least one species, \"Themiste pyroides\", swarming behaviour occurs with adults creating compact masses among rocks immediately before spawning.\nAlthough some species hatch directly into the adult form, many have a trochophore larva, which metamorphoses into the adult after anything from a day to a month, depending on species. In a few species, the trochophore does not develop directly into the adult, but into an intermediate \"pelagosphaera\" stage, that possesses a greatly enlarged metatroch (ciliated band). Metamorphosis occurs only in the presence of suitable habitat conditions, and is triggered by the presence of adults.\nBehaviour.\nMost sipunculans are deposit feeders employing a number of different methods to obtain their foods. Those living in burrows extend their tentacles over the surface of the sediment. Food particles get trapped in mucous secretions and the beating of cilia transport the particles to the mouth. Among those that burrow through the sand, the tentacles are replaced by fluted folds which scoop up sediment and food particles. Most of this material is swallowed but larger particles are discarded. Species dwelling in crevices are able to withdraw their introverts, blocking the crevice entrance with their thickened trunks and presumably ingesting any food they have snared at the same time. One species, \"Thysanocardia procera\" is thought to be carnivorous, gaining entrance in some way to the interior of the sea mouse \"Aphrodita aculeata\" and sucking out its liquefied contents.\nFossil record.\nBecause of their soft-bodied structure, fossils of sipunculans are extremely rare, and are only known from a few genera. \"Archaeogolfingia\" and \"Cambrosipunculus\" appear in the Cambrian Chengjiang biota in China. These fossils appear to belong to the crown group, and demonstrate that sipunculans have changed little (morphologically) since the early Cambrian, about 520 million years ago.\nAn unnamed sipunculid worm from the Cambrian period has been discovered in the Burgess Shale in Alberta, Canada, and \"Lecthaylus\" has been identified from the Granton Shrimp Bed, near Edinburgh, Scotland, dating to the Silurian period. Trace fossils of burrows that may have been formed by sipunculans have been found from the Paleozoic.\nSome scientists once hypothesized a close relationship between sipunculans and the extinct hyoliths, operculate shells from the Palaeozoic with which they share a helical gut; but this hypothesis has since been discounted.\nAs food.\nSipunculid worm jelly () is a delicacy in southeast China, originally from Anhai, near Quanzhou. A sipunculid worm dish is also considered a delicacy in the islands of the Visayas region, Philippines. The muscle is first prepared by soaking it in spiced vinegar and then served with other ingredients as a dish similar to ceviche. It is a basic food for local fisherman and is sometimes seen in city restaurants as an appetizer. This style of food preparation is locally called kilawin or kinilaw, and is also used for fish, conch and vegetables.\nThe worms, especially in dried form, are considered a delicacy in Vietnam as well, where they are caught on the coasts of Minh Chao island, in Van Don District. The relatively high market price of the worms have made them a significant source of income for the local population of fishermen families.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The family is composed of around 100 species of vermiform creatures which live in thin tubes buried in sediment (Pogonophora) or in tubes attached to hard substratum (Vestimentifera) at ocean depths ranging from . They can also be found in association with hydrothermal vents, methane seeps, sunken plant material, and whale carcasses.\nThe first specimen was dredged from the waters of Indonesia in 1900. These specimens were given to French zoologist Maurice Caullery, who studied them for nearly 50 years.\nAnatomy.\nMost siboglinids are less than in diameter, but in length. They inhabit tubular structures composed of chitin which are fixed to rocks or substrates. The tubes are often clustered together in large colonies.\nTheir bodies are divided into four regions. The anterior end is called the cephalic lobe, which ranges from one to over 200 thin branchial ciliated tentacles, each with tiny side branches known as pinnules. Behind this is a glandular forepart, which helps to secrete the tube. The main part of the body is the trunk, which is greatly elongated and bears various annuli, papillae, and ciliary tracts. Posterior to the trunk is the short metamerically segmented opisthosoma, bearing external paired chaetae, which help to anchor the animal to the base of its tube.\nThe body cavity has a separate compartment in each of the first three regions of the body and extends into the tentacles. The opisthosoma has a coelomic chamber in each of its 5 to 23 segments, separated by septa. The worms have a complex closed circulatory system and a well-developed nervous system, but as adults, siboglinids completely lack a mouth, gut, and anus.\nEvolution.\nThe family Siboglinidae has been difficult to place in an evolutionary context. After examination of genetic differences between annelids, Siboglinidae were placed within the order Polychaeta by scientific consensus. The fossil record along with molecular clocks suggest the family has Mesozoic (250 \u2013 66 Mya) or Cenozoic (66 Mya \u2013 recent) origins. However, some fossils of crystallized tubes are attributed to early Siboglinidae dating back to 500 Mya. The oldest definitive specimens referred to the family came from Early Jurassic (Pliensbachian-Toarcian) Figueroa Sulfide deposits from San Rafael Mountains, found to be similar to modern \"Ridgeia\". This tubes, known as 'Figueroa tubes', along the 'Troodos collared tubes' (Cyprus, Turonian) were resolved among modern vestimentiferans. \nMolecular work aligning five genes has identified four distinct clades within Siboglinidae, These being \"Vestimentifera\", \"Sclerolinum\", \"Frenulata\", and \"Osedax\". Vestimentiferans live in vent and seep habitats. Separation of vestimentiferans into seep and deep-sea-dwelling clades is still debated due to some phylogenies based on sequencing data placing the genera along a continuum. \"Sclerolinum\" is a monogeneric clade (which may be called Monilifera) living on organic-rich remains. Frenulates live in organic-rich sediment habitats. \"Osedax\" is a monogeneric clade specialized in living on whale bones, although recent evidence shows them living on fish bones as well.\nThe following are cladograms of Siboglinidae:\nGenera.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nVestimentiferans.\nLike other tube worms, vestimentiferans are benthic marine creatures. \"Riftia pachyptila\", a vestimentiferan, is known only from the hydrothermal vent systems. \nCladogram based on a maximum likelihood tree of concatenated 16-gene nucleotide data:\nAnatomy of vestimentiferans.\nVestimentiferan bodies are divided into four regions: the obturaculum, vestimentum, trunk, and opisthosome. The main trunk of the body bears wing-like extensions. Unlike other siboglinids that never have a digestive tract, they have one that they completely lose during metamorphosis.\nThe obturaculum is the first anterior body part. It is possible that the obturaculum is actually an outgrowth of the vestimentum rather than a separate body segment which would distinguish it from other siboglinids.\nThe vestimentum, from which the group's name is derived, is a wing-like body part with glands that secrete the tube. In a ventroanterior position in the vestimentum is the brain which is postulated to be simpler than relatives that maintain a gut in the adult form. The opisthosome is the anchoring rear body part.\nVestimentiferan ecology.\nTheir primary nutrition is derived from the sulfide-rich fluids emanating from the hydrothermal vents where they live. The sulfides are metabolized by symbiotic hydrogen sulfide- or methane-oxidizing bacteria living in an internal organ, the trophosome. One gram of trophosome tissue can contain one billion bacteria. The origin of this symbiotic relationship is not currently known. The bacteria appear to colonize the host animal larvae after they have settled on a surface, entering them through their skin. This method of entry, known as horizontal transmission, means that each organism may have different species of bacteria assisting in this symbiosis. However, these bacteria all play similar roles in sustaining the vestimentiferans. Endosymbionts have a wide variety of metabolic genes, which may allow them to switch between autotrophic and heterotrophic methods of nutrient acquisition. When the host dies, the bacteria are released and return to the free-living population in the seawater.\nDiscovery of the hydrothermal vents in the eastern Pacific Ocean was quickly followed by the discovery and description of new vestimentiferan tubeworm species. These tubeworms are one of the most dominant organisms associated with the hydrothermal vents in the Pacific Ocean. Tubeworms anchor themselves to the substratum of the hydrocarbon seep by roots located at the basal portion of their bodies. Intact tubeworm roots have proven very difficult to obtain for study because they are extremely delicate, and often break off when a tubeworm is removed from hypothermal vent regions. How long the roots of the tube worms can grow is unknown, but roots have been recovered longer than 30\u00a0m.\nA single aggregation of tubeworms can contain thousands of individuals, and the roots produced by each tubeworm can become tangled with the roots of neighbouring tubeworms. These mats of roots are known as \"ropes\", and travel down the tubes of dead tubeworms, and run through holes in rocks. The diameter and wall thickness of the tubeworm roots do not appear to change with distance from the trunk portion of the tubeworm's body.\nLike the trunk portion of the body, the roots of the vestimentiferan tubeworms are composed of chitin crystallites, which support and protect the tubeworm from predation and environmental stresses. Tubeworms build the external chitin structure themselves by secreting chitin from specialized glands located in their body walls.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "43139", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43139", "title": "Placozoa", "text": "Phylum of aquatic animals\nPlacozoa ( ; lit.\u2009'flat animals') is a phylum of free-living (non-parasitic) marine invertebrates. They are blob-like animals composed of aggregations of cells. Moving in water by ciliary motion, eating food by engulfment, reproducing by fission or budding, placozoans are described as \"the simplest animals on Earth\". Structural and molecular analyses have supported them as among the most basal animals, thus constituting a primitive metazoan phylum.\nThe first known placozoan, \"Trichoplax adhaerens\", was discovered in 1883 by the German zoologist Franz Eilhard Schulze (1840\u20131921). Describing the uniqueness, another German, Karl Gottlieb Grell (1912\u20131994), erected a new phylum, Placozoa, for it in 1971. Remaining a monotypic phylum for over a century, new species began to be added since 2018. So far, three other extant species have been described, in two distinct classes: Uniplacotomia (\"Hoilungia hongkongensis\" in 2018 and \"Cladtertia collaboinventa\" in 2022) and Polyplacotomia (\"Polyplacotoma mediterranea\", the most basal, in 2019). A single putative fossil species is known, the Middle Triassic \"Maculicorpus microbialis\".\nHistory.\n\"Trichoplax\" was discovered in 1883 by the German zoologist Franz Eilhard Schulze, in a seawater aquarium at the Zoological Institute in Graz, Austria. The generic name is derived from the classical Greek ('), meaning \"hair\", and ('), \"plate\". The specific epithet \"adhaerens\" is Latin meaning \"adherent\", reflecting its propensity to stick to the glass slides and pipettes used in its examination. Schulze realized that the animal could not be a member of any existing phyla, and based on the simple structure and behaviour, concluded in 1891 that it must be an early metazoan. He also observed the reproduction by fission, cell layers and locomotion. \nIn 1893, Italian zoologist Francesco Saverio Monticelli described another animal which he named \"Treptoplax\", the specimens of which he collected from Naples. He gave the species name \"T. reptans\" in 1896. Monticelli did not preserve them and no other specimens were found again, as a result of which the identification is ruled as doubtful, and the species rejected.\nSchulze's description was opposed by other zoologists. For instance, in 1890, F.C. Noll argued that the animal was a flat worm (Turbellaria). In 1907, Thilo Krumbach published a hypothesis that \"Trichoplax\" is not a distinct animal but that it is a form of the planula larva of the anemone-like hydrozoan \"Eleutheria krohni\". Although this was refuted in print by Schulze and others, Krumbach's analysis became the standard textbook explanation, and nothing was printed in zoological journals about \"Trichoplax\" until the 1960s. \nThe development of electron microscopy in the mid-20th century allowed in-depth observation of the cellular components of organisms, following which there was renewed interest in \"Trichoplax\" starting in 1966. The most important descriptions were made by Karl Gottlieb Grell at the University of T\u00fcbingen since 1971. That year, Grell revived Schulze's interpretation that the animals are unique and created a new phylum Placozoa. Grell derived the name from the placula hypothesis, Otto B\u00fctschli's notion on the origin of metazoans.\nBiology.\nAnatomy.\nPlacozoans do not have well-defined body plans, much like amoebas, unicellular eukaryotes. As Andrew Masterson reported: \"they are as close as it is possible to get to being simply a little living blob.\" An individual body measures about 0.55\u00a0mm in diameter. There are no body parts; as one of the researchers Michael Eitel described: \"There's no mouth, there's no back, no nerve cells, nothing.\" Animals studied in laboratories have bodies consisting of everything from hundreds to millions of cells. \nPlacozoans have only three anatomical parts as tissue layers inside its body: the upper, intermediate (middle) and lower epithelia. There are at least six different cell types. (A 2023 analysis of 4 species across 3 genera found 8, one with an unknown role.) The upper epithelium is the thinnest portion and essentially comprises flat cells with their cell body hanging underneath the surface, and each cell having a cilium. Crystal cells are sparsely distributed near the marginal edge. A few cells have unusually large number of mitochondria. The middle layer is the thickest made up of numerous fiber cells, which contain mitochondrial complexes, vacuoles and endosymbiotic bacteria in the endoplasmic reticulum. The lower epithelium consists of numerous monociliated cylinder cells along with a few endocrine-like gland cells and lipophil cells. Each lipophil cell contains numerous middle-sized granules, one of which is a secretory granule.\nThe body axes of \"Hoilungia\" and \"Trichoplax\" are overtly similar to the oral\u2013aboral axis of cnidarians, animals from another phylum with which they are most closely related. Structurally, they can not be distinguished from other placozoans, so that identification is purely on genetic (mitochondrial DNA) differences. Genome sequencing has shown that each species has a set of unique genes and several uniquely missing genes.\n\"Trichoplax\" is a small, flattened, animal around across. An amorphous multi-celled body, analogous to a single-celled amoebas, it has no regular outline, although the lower surface is somewhat concave, and the upper surface is always flattened. The body consists of an outer layer of simple epithelium enclosing a loose sheet of stellate cells resembling the mesenchyme of some more complex animals. The epithelial cells bear cilia, which the animal uses to help it creep along the seafloor.\nThe lower surface engulfs small particles of organic detritus, on which the animal feeds.\nStudies suggest that aragonite crystals in crystal cells have the same function as statoliths, allowing it to use gravity for spatial orientation.\nLocated in the dorsal epithelium there are lipid granules which release a cocktail of toxins as a means of defense, and can induce paralysis or death in some predators. Genes encoding for proteins which make up the poisonous secretions of \"Trichoplax\" have been found to strongly resemble venom-associated genes present in the genomes of certain snakes, like the American copperhead and the West African carpet viper.\nProto-nervous system.\nThe Placozoa have a very primitive analogue of the nervous system. It has peptideric cells that resemble neurons in that they have G protein-coupled receptors and release vesicles and neuropeptides. They are descended from progenitor cells with an expression pattern similar to that of neuron progenitor cells and themselves express genes associated with the pre-synaptic scaffold. Still, they differ from cnidarian neurons by having no projections and not expressing genes of the post-synaptic scaffold. There are a total of 14 types of these peptideric cells.\nReproduction.\nAll placozoans can reproduce asexually, budding off smaller individuals, and the lower surface may also bud off eggs into the mesenchyme. Sexual reproduction has been reported to occur in one clade of placozoans, whose strain H8 was later found to belong to genus \"Cladtertia\", where intergenic recombination was observed as well as other hallmarks of sexual reproduction.\nIn addition to fission, representatives of all species produced \"swarmers\" (a separate vegetative reproduction stage), which could also be formed from the lower epithelium with greater cell-type diversity.\nEndosymbionts.\nSome \"Trichoplax\" species contain \"Rickettsiales\" bacteria as endosymbionts.\nOne of the at least 20\u00a0described species turned out to have two bacterial endosymbionts; \"Grellia\" which lives in the animal's endoplasmic reticulum and is assumed to play a role in the protein and membrane production. The other endosymbiont is the first described \"Margulisbacteria\", that lives inside cells used for algal digestion. It appears to eat the fats and other lipids of the algae and provide its host with vitamins and amino acids in return.\nEvolution and population dynamics.\nThe Placozoa show substantial evolutionary radiation in regard to sodium channels, of which they have 5\u20137\u00a0different types, more than any other invertebrate species studied to date.\nThree modes of population dynamics depended upon feeding sources, including induction of social behaviors, morphogenesis, and reproductive strategies.\nEvolutionary relationships.\nThere is no convincing fossil record of the Placozoa, although the Ediacaran biota (Precambrian, https://\u00a0million years ago) organism \"Dickinsonia\" appears somewhat similar to placozoans. Knaust (2021) reported preservation of placozoan fossils in a microbialite bed from the Middle Triassic Muschelkalk (Germany).\nTraditionally, classification was based on their level of organization, i.e., they possess no tissues or organs. However this may be as a result of secondary loss and thus is inadequate to exclude them from relationships with more complex animals. More recent work has attempted to classify them based on the DNA sequences in their genome; this has placed the phylum between the sponges and the Eumetazoa. In such a feature-poor phylum, molecular data are considered to provide the most reliable approximation of the placozoans' phylogeny.\nTheir exact position on the phylogenetic tree would give important information about the origin of neurons and muscles. If the absence of these features is an original trait of the Placozoa, it would mean that a nervous system and muscles evolved three times should placozoans and cnidarians be a sister group; once in the Ctenophora, once in the Cnidaria and once in the Bilateria. If they branched off before the Cnidaria and Bilateria split, the neurons and muscles would have the same origin in the two latter groups.\nFunctional-morphology hypothesis: Sister to Porifera and Eumetazoa.\nOn the basis of their simple structure, the Placozoa were frequently viewed as a model organism for the transition from unicellular organisms to the multicellular animals (Metazoa) and are thus considered a sister taxon to all other metazoans:\nAccording to a functional-morphology model, all or most animals are descended from a \"gallertoid\", a free-living (pelagic) sphere in seawater, consisting of a single ciliated layer of cells supported by a thin, noncellular separating layer, the basal lamina. The interior of the sphere is filled with contractile fibrous cells and a gelatinous extracellular matrix. Both the modern Placozoa and all other animals then descended from this multicellular beginning stage via two different processes:\nWhile the probability of encountering food, potential sexual partners, or predators is the same in all directions for animals floating freely in the water, there is a clear difference on the seafloor between the functions useful on body sides facing toward and away from the substrate, leading their sensory, defensive, and food-gathering cells to differentiate and orient according to the vertical \u2013 the direction perpendicular to the substrate. In the proposed functional-morphology model, the Placozoa, and possibly several similar organisms only known from the fossils, are descended from such a life form, which is now termed \"placuloid\". \nThree different life strategies have accordingly led to three different possible lines of development:\nShould any of the analyses presented above turn out to be correct, \"Trichoplax adhaerens\" would be the oldest branch of the multicellular animals, and a relic of the Ediacaran fauna, or even the pre-Ediacara fauna. Although very successful in their ecological niche, due to the absence of extracellular matrix and basal lamina, the development potential of these animals was of course limited, which would explain the low rate of evolution of their phenotype (their outward form as adults) \u2013 referred to as \"bradytely\". \nThis hypothesis was supported by a recent analysis of the \"Trichoplax adhaerens\" mitochondrial genome in comparison to those of other animals. The hypothesis was, however, rejected in a statistical analysis of the \"Trichoplax adhaerens\" whole genome sequence in comparison to the whole genome sequences of six other animals and two related non-animal species, but only at which indicates a marginal level of statistical significance.\nEpitheliozoa hypothesis: Sister to Eumetazoa.\nA concept based on purely morphological characteristics pictures the Placozoa as the nearest relative of the animals with true tissues (Eumetazoa). The taxon they share, called the Epitheliozoa, is itself construed to be a sister group to the sponges (Porifera):\nThe above view could be correct, although there is some evidence that the ctenophores, traditionally seen as Eumetazoa, may be the sister to all other animals. This is now a disputed classification. Placozoans are estimated to have emerged 750\u2013800 million years ago, and the first modern neuron to have originated in the common ancestor of cnidarians and bilaterians about 650\u00a0million years ago (many of the genes expressed in modern neurons are absent in ctenophores, although some of these missing genes are present in placozoans).\nThe principal support for such a relationship comes from special cell to cell junctions \u2013 belt desmosomes \u2013 that occur not just in the Placozoa but in all animals \"except\" the sponges: They enable the cells to join in an unbroken layer like the epitheloid of the Placozoa. \"T. adhaerens\" also shares the ventral gland cells with most eumetazoans. Both characteristics can be considered evolutionarily derived features (apomorphies), and thus form the basis of a common taxon for all animals that possess them. \nOne possible scenario inspired by the proposed hypothesis starts with the idea that the monociliated cells of the epitheloid in \"T. adhaerens\" evolved by reduction of the collars in the collar cells (choanocytes) of sponges as the hypothesized ancestors of the Placozoa abandoned a filtering mode of life. The epitheloid would then have served as the precursor to the true epithelial tissue of the eumetazoans.\nIn contrast to the model based on functional morphology described earlier, in the Epitheliozoa hypothesis, the ventral and dorsal cell layers of the Placozoa are homologs of endoderm and ectoderm \u2014 the two basic embryonic cell layers of the eumetazoans. The digestive \"gastrodermis\" in the Cnidaria or the gut epithelium in the bilaterally symmetrical animals (Bilateria) may have developed from endoderm, whereas ectoderm is the precursor to the external skin layer (epidermis), among other things. The interior space pervaded by a fiber syncytium in the Placozoa would then correspond to connective tissue in the other animals. It is unclear whether the calcium ions stored in the syncytium would be related to the lime skeletons of many cnidarians.\nAs noted above, this hypothesis was supported in a statistical analysis of the \"Trichoplax adhaerens\" whole genome sequence, as compared to the whole-genome sequences of six other animals and two related non-animal species.\nEumetazoa/ParaHoxozoa hypotheses.\nA third hypothesis, based primarily on molecular genetics, views the Placozoa as highly simplified eumetazoans. According to this, \"Trichoplax adhaerens\" is descended from considerably more complex animals that already had muscles and nerve tissues. Both tissue types, as well as the basal lamina of the epithelium, were accordingly lost more recently by radical secondary simplification.\nVarious studies in this regard so far yield differing results for identifying the exact sister group: In one case, the Placozoa would qualify as the nearest relatives of the Cnidaria, while in another they would be a sister group to the Ctenophora, and occasionally they are placed directly next to the Bilateria.\nSister to Planulozoa.\nIn 2018, they are typically placed according to the cladogram below:\nIn this cladogram the Epitheliozoa and Eumetazoa are synonyms to each other and to the Diploblasts, and the Ctenophora are basal to them.\nAn argument raised against the proposed scenario is that it leaves morphological features of the animals completely out of consideration. The extreme degree of simplification that would have to be postulated for the Placozoa in this model, moreover, is only known for parasitic organisms, but would be difficult to explain functionally in a free-living species like \"Trichoplax adhaerens\".\nThis version is supported by statistical analysis of the \"Trichoplax adhaerens\" whole genome sequence in comparison to the whole genome sequences of six other animals and two related non-animal species. However, Ctenophora was not included in the analyses, placing the placozoans outside of the sampled Eumetazoans.\nThis version is more strongly supported by a 2023 analysis using 209 marker genes, Bayesian inference, and a sophisticated substitution model (CAT + GTR + \u04134). A few other variations (other gene-sets, recoding) produce the same result. Single-cell genomics performed in the study indicate that the Placozoa do have a primitive version of neurons called peptideric cells. These cells can receive information through GPCRs and release information through vesicles and neuropeptides. They express the pre-synaptic program. Features present in Planulozoan neurons but absent in Placozoan peptideric cells are the post-synaptic program, cell projections, and ion channels; these are believed to have evolved in the Planulozoa ancestor. The Bilaterian neuron build on top of these features by the evolution of specialized synapses, neuronal cytoskeleton, and neuronal cell adhesion.\nSister to Cnidaria.\nDNA comparisons suggest that placozoans are related to Cnidaria, derived from planula larva (as seen in some Cnidaria). The Bilateria also are thought to be derived from planuloids. The Cnidaria and Placozoa body axis are overtly similar, and placozoan and cnidarian cells are responsive to the same neuropeptide antibodies despite extant placozoans not developing any neurons.\nInternal phylogeny.\nThe internal relationships among placozoa has been studied using ribosomal DNA, mitochondrial DNA, and phylogenomics (gene content comparison). The latter methods require the sequencing of more DNA but produce more reliable results.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They have sac-like bodies, and three distinctly different forms in different parts of their two-stage life-cycle. They appear so different from other animals that they were assigned their phylum, Cycliophora, shortly after being discovered in 1995. Cycliophora was the first new phylum of multicelled organism to be discovered since the Loricifera in 1983.\nTaxonomy.\n\"Symbion pandora\" was discovered in 1995 by Reinhardt Kristensen and Peter Funch on the mouthparts of the Norway lobster (\"Nephrops norvegicus\"). Other, related, species have since been discovered on:\nThe genus is so named because of its commensal relationship with the lobster (a form of symbiosis) \u2013 it feeds on the leftovers from the lobster's foods.\nThey are peculiar microscopic animals, with no obvious close relatives, which were therefore given their own phylum, called Cycliophora. The phylogenetic position of \"Symbion\" is still not finally settled. It is currently placed in the clade Polyzoa along with the phyla Ectoprocta and Entoprocta, based on genetic analysis.\nDescription.\n\"Symbion pandora\" has a bilateral, sac-like body with no coelom. There are three basic life stages:\nReproduction.\n\"Symbion\" reproduces both asexually and sexually, and has a complex reproduction cycle, a strategy evolved to produce as many offspring as possible that can survive and find a new host when the lobster they live on sheds its shell. The asexual individuals are the largest ones. The sexual individuals do not eat.\nDuring the autumn, \"Symbion\" makes copies of itself, with a new individual growing inside the parent body, one offspring at the time. The new offspring attach themselves to an available spot on the lobster, begin to feed and eventually start making new copies of themselves. \nIn early winter, the asexual animals start producing males. When a male is born, it crawls away from its parent and glues itself to another asexual individual. Once attached, the male produces two dwarf males inside its body, which turns into a hollow pouch. Each of the two dwarf males are about one hundred times smaller than the asexual individual to which they are attached. Their bodies start out with about 200 cells, but this number lowers to just 47 by the time they reach maturity. Thirty-four of the cells form its nervous system, and three more become sensory cells used to help them feel their surroundings. Eight cells becomes mucous glands, which produce mucus that helps them move across the surface. The final two cells form the testes, which make the sperm that fertilize the female's egg. Most of the cells of the dwarf males also lose their nucleus and shrink to almost half their size, which is an adaptation that allows two mature individuals to fit inside the body of the parent male. Two males increases their chances to fertilize a female. \nBy late winter, when the large feeding individuals in the colony have males attached to their bodies, they start making females. Each female has a single egg inside her. When she is about to be born, one of the two dwarf males fertilizes her when she comes out. The fertilized female finds herself a place on the host's whiskers where she attaches herself. The developing embryo extracts nutrients from its mother, leaving her an empty husk by the time it is ready to be born. \"Symbion\" individuals who succeed in finding a new host will attach themselves to its mouthparts, where it will grow a stomach and mouthparts, morphing into a large, feeding and asexual form.\nThe larval stage is unscientifically referred to as \"sea worms\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

While bilaterally symmetrical as larvae, as adults echinoderms are recognisable by their usually five-pointed radial symmetry (pentamerous symmetry), and are found on the sea bed at every ocean depth from the intertidal zone to the abyssal zone. The phylum contains about 7,600 living species, making it the second-largest group of deuterostomes after the chordates, as well as the largest marine-only phylum. The first definitive echinoderms appeared near the start of the Cambrian.\nEchinoderms are important both ecologically and geologically. Ecologically, there are few other groupings so abundant in the deep sea, as well as shallower oceans. Most echinoderms are able to reproduce asexually and regenerate tissue, organs and limbs; in some cases, they can undergo complete regeneration from a single limb. Geologically, the value of echinoderms is in their ossified dermal endoskeletons, which are major contributors to many limestone formations and can provide valuable clues as to the geological environment. They were the most used species in regenerative research in the 19th and 20th centuries. Further, some scientists hold that the radiation of echinoderms was responsible for the Mesozoic Marine Revolution.\nEtymology.\nThe name echinoderm is from grc \" ' ()\"\u00a0'hedgehog' and \" ' ()\"\u00a0'skin'.\nThe name Echinodermata was originated by Jacob Theodor Klein in 1734, but only in reference to echinoids. It was expanded to the phylum level by Jean Guillaume Brugui\u00e8re, first informally in 1789 and then in formal Latin in 1791. In 1955, Libbie Hyman attributed the name to \"Brugui\u00e8re, 1791 [ex Klein, 1734].\"\nThis attribution has become common and is listed by the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS), although some workers believe that the ITIS rules should result in attributing \"Klein, 1778\" due to a 2nd edition of his work published by Leske in that year.\nWhile Echinodermata has been in common use since the mid-1800s, several other names had been proposed. Notably, F. A. Bather called the phylum \"Echinoderma\" (apparently after Latreille, 1825) in his 1900 treatise on the phylum, but this name now refers to a fungus.\nDiversity.\nThere are about 7,600 extant species of echinoderm as well as about 13,000 known extinct species. All echinoderms are marine, but they are found in habitats ranging from shallow intertidal areas to abyssal depths. Five extant classes of echinoderms are generally recognized: the Asteroidea (starfish, with over 1900 species), Ophiuroidea (brittle stars, with around 2,300 species), Echinoidea (sea urchins and sand dollars, with some 900 species), Holothuroidea (sea cucumbers, with about 1,430 species), and Crinoidea (feather stars and sea lilies, with around 580 species).\nAnatomy and physiology.\nEchinoderms evolved from animals with bilateral symmetry. Although adult echinoderms possess pentaradial symmetry, their larvae are ciliated, free-swimming organisms with bilateral symmetry. Later, during metamorphosis, the left side of the body grows at the expense of the right side, which is eventually absorbed. The left side then grows in a pentaradially symmetric fashion, in which the body is arranged in five parts around a central axis. Within the Asterozoa, there are a few exceptions from the rule. Most starfish in the genus \"Leptasterias\" have six arms, although five-armed individuals can occur. The Brisingida also contain some six-armed species. Amongst the brittle stars, six-armed species such as \"Ophiothela danae\", \"Ophiactis savignyi\", and \"Ophionotus hexactis\" exist, and \"Ophiacantha vivipara\" often has more than six.\nEchinoderms have secondary radial symmetry in portions of their body at some stage of life, most likely an adaptation to a sessile or slow-moving existence. Many crinoids and some seastars are symmetrical in multiples of the basic five; starfish such as \"Labidiaster annulatus\" possess up to fifty arms, while the sea-lily \"Comaster schlegelii\" has two hundred.\nGenetic studies have shown that genes directing anterior-most development are expressed along ambulacra in the center of starfish rays, with the next-most-anterior genes expressed in the surrounding fringe of tube feet. Genes related to the beginning of the trunk are expressed at the ray margins, but trunk genes are only expressed in interior tissue rather than on the body surface. This means that a starfish body can more-or-less be considered to consist only of a head.\nSkin and skeleton.\nEchinoderms have a mesodermal skeleton in the dermis, composed of calcite-based plates known as ossicles. If solid, these would form a heavy skeleton, so they have a sponge-like porous structure known as stereom. Ossicles may be fused together, as in the test of sea urchins, or may articulate to form flexible joints as in the arms of sea stars, brittle stars and crinoids. The ossicles may bear external projections in the form of spines, granules or warts and they are supported by a tough epidermis. Skeletal elements are sometimes deployed in specialized ways, such as the chewing organ called \"Aristotle's lantern\" in sea urchins, the supportive stalks of crinoids, and the structural \"lime ring\" of sea cucumbers.\nAlthough individual ossicles are robust and fossilize readily, complete skeletons of starfish, brittle stars and crinoids are rare in the fossil record. On the other hand, sea urchins are often well preserved in chalk beds or limestone. During fossilization, the cavities in the stereom are filled in with calcite that is continuous with the surrounding rock. On fracturing such rock, paleontologists can observe distinctive cleavage patterns and sometimes even the intricate internal and external structure of the test.\nThe epidermis contains pigment cells that provide the often vivid colours of echinoderms, which include deep red, stripes of black and white, and intense purple. These cells may be light-sensitive, causing many echinoderms to change appearance completely as night falls. The reaction can happen quickly: the sea urchin \"Centrostephanus longispinus\" changes colour in just fifty minutes when exposed to light.\nOne characteristic of most echinoderms is a special kind of tissue known as catch connective tissue. This collagen-based material can change its mechanical properties under nervous control rather than by muscular means. This tissue enables a starfish to go from moving flexibly around the seabed to becoming rigid while prying open a bivalve mollusc or preventing itself from being extracted from a crevice. Similarly, sea urchins can lock their normally mobile spines upright as a defensive mechanism when attacked.\nThe water vascular system.\nEchinoderms possess a unique water vascular system, a network of fluid-filled canals modified from the coelom (body cavity) that function in gas exchange, feeding, sensory reception and locomotion. This system varies between different classes of echinoderm but typically opens to the exterior through a sieve-like madreporite on the aboral (upper) surface of the animal. The madreporite is linked to a slender duct, the stone canal, which extends to a ring canal that encircles the mouth or oesophagus. The ring canal branches into a set of radial canals, which in asteroids extend along the arms, and in echinoids adjoin the test in the ambulacral areas. Short lateral canals branch off the radial canals, each one ending in an ampulla. Part of the ampulla can protrude through a pore (or a pair of pores in sea urchins) to the exterior, forming a podium or tube foot. The water vascular system assists with the distribution of nutrients throughout the animal's body; it is most visible in the tube feet which can be extended or contracted by the redistribution of fluid between the foot and the internal ampulla.\nThe organisation of the water vascular system is somewhat different in ophiuroids, where the madreporite may be on the oral surface and the podia lack suckers. In holothuroids, the system is reduced, often with few tube feet other than the specialised feeding tentacles, and the madreporite opens on to the coelom. Some holothuroids like the Apodida lack tube feet and canals along the body; others have longitudinal canals. The arrangement in crinoids is similar to that in asteroids, but the tube feet lack suckers and are used in a back-and-forth wafting motion to pass food particles captured by the arms towards the central mouth. In the asteroids, the same motion is employed to move the animal across the ground.\nOther organs.\nEchinoderms possess a simple digestive system which varies according to the animal's diet. Starfish are mostly carnivorous and have a mouth, oesophagus, two-part stomach, intestine and rectum, with the anus located in the centre of the aboral body surface. With a few exceptions, the members of the order Paxillosida do not possess an anus. In many species of starfish, the large cardiac stomach can be everted to digest food outside the body. Some other species are able to ingest whole food items such as molluscs. Brittle stars, which have varying diets, have a blind gut with no intestine or anus; they expel food waste through their mouth. Sea urchins are herbivores and use their specialised mouthparts to graze, tear and chew their food, mainly algae. They have an oesophagus, a large stomach and a rectum with the anus at the apex of the test. Sea cucumbers are mostly detritivores, sorting through the sediment with modified tube feet around their mouth, the buccal tentacles. Sand and mud accompanies their food through their simple gut, which has a long coiled intestine and a large cloaca. Crinoids are suspension feeders, passively catching plankton which drift into their outstretched arms. Boluses of mucus-trapped food are passed to the mouth, which is linked to the anus by a loop consisting of a short oesophagus and longer intestine.\nThe coelomic cavities of echinoderms are complex. Aside from the water vascular system, echinoderms have a haemal coelom, a perivisceral coelom, a gonadal coelom and often also a perihaemal coelom. During development, echinoderm coelom is divided into the metacoel, mesocoel and protocoel (also called somatocoel, hydrocoel and axocoel, respectively). The water vascular system, haemal system and perihaemal system form the tubular coelomic system. Echinoderms are unusual in having both a coelomic circulatory system (the water vascular system) and a haemal circulatory system, as most groups of animals have just one of the two.\nHaemal and perihaemal systems are derived from the original coelom, forming an open and reduced circulatory system. This usually consists of a central ring and five radial vessels. There is no true heart, and the blood often lacks any respiratory pigment. Gaseous exchange occurs via dermal branchiae or papulae in starfish, genital bursae in brittle stars, peristomial gills in sea urchins and cloacal trees in sea cucumbers. Exchange of gases also takes place through the tube feet. Echinoderms lack specialized excretory (waste disposal) organs and so nitrogenous waste, chiefly in the form of ammonia, diffuses out through the respiratory surfaces.\nThe coelomic fluid contains the coelomocytes, or immune cells. There are several types of immune cells, which vary among classes and species. All classes possess a type of phagocytic amebocyte, which engulf invading particles and infected cells, aggregate or clot, and may be involved in cytotoxicity. These cells are usually large and granular, and are believed to be a main line of defence against potential pathogens. Depending on the class, echinoderms may have spherule cells (for cytotoxicity, inflammation, and anti-bacterial activity), vibratile cells (for coelomic fluid movement and clotting), and crystal cells (which may serve for osmoregulation in sea cucumbers). The coelomocytes secrete antimicrobial peptides against bacteria, and have a set of lectins and complement proteins as part of an innate immune system that is still being characterised.\nEchinoderms have a simple radial nervous system that consists of a modified nerve net of interconnected neurons with no central brain, although some do possess ganglia. Nerves radiate from central rings around the mouth into each arm or along the body wall; the branches of these nerves coordinate the movements of the organism and the synchronisation of the tube feet. Starfish have sensory cells in the epithelium and have simple eyespots and touch-sensitive tentacle-like tube feet at the tips of their arms. Sea urchins have no particular sense organs but do have statocysts that assist in gravitational orientation, and they too have sensory cells in their epidermis, particularly in the tube feet, spines and pedicellariae. Brittle stars, crinoids and sea cucumbers in general do not have sensory organs, but some burrowing sea cucumbers of the order Apodida have a single statocyst adjoining each radial nerve, and some have an eyespot at the base of each tentacle.\nThe gonads at least periodically occupy much of the body cavities of sea urchins and sea cucumbers, while the less voluminous crinoids, brittle stars and starfish have two gonads in each arm. While the ancestors of modern echinoderms are believed to have had one genital aperture, many organisms have multiple gonopores through which eggs or sperm may be released.\nRegeneration.\nMany echinoderms have great powers of regeneration. Many species routinely autotomize and regenerate arms and viscera. Sea cucumbers often discharge parts of their internal organs if they perceive themselves to be threatened, regenerating them over the course of several months. Sea urchins constantly replace spines lost through damage, while sea stars and sea lilies readily lose and regenerate their arms. In most cases, a single severed arm cannot grow into a new starfish in the absence of at least part of the disc. However, in a few species a single arm can survive and develop into a complete individual, and arms are sometimes intentionally detached for the purpose of asexual reproduction. During periods when they have lost their digestive tracts, sea cucumbers live off stored nutrients and absorb dissolved organic matter directly from the water.\nThe regeneration of lost parts involves both epimorphosis and morphallaxis. In epimorphosis stem cells, either from a reserve pool or those produced by dedifferentiation, form a blastema and generate new tissues. Morphallactic regeneration involves the movement and remodelling of existing tissues to replace lost parts. Direct transdifferentiation of one type of tissue to another during tissue replacement is also observed.\nReproduction.\nSexual reproduction.\nEchinoderms become sexually mature after approximately two to three years, depending on the species and the environmental conditions. Almost all species have separate male and female sexes, though some are hermaphroditic. The eggs and sperm cells are typically released into open water, where fertilisation takes place. The release of sperm and eggs is synchronised in some species, usually with regard to the lunar cycle. In other species, individuals may aggregate during the reproductive season, increasing the likelihood of successful fertilisation. Internal fertilisation has been observed in three species of sea star, three brittle stars and a deep-water sea cucumber. Even at abyssal depths, where no light penetrates, echinoderms often synchronise their reproductive activity.\nSome echinoderms brood their eggs. This is especially common in cold water species where planktonic larvae might not be able to find sufficient food. These retained eggs are usually few in number and are supplied with large yolks to nourish the developing embryos. In starfish, the female may carry the eggs in special pouches, under her arms, under her arched body, or even in her cardiac stomach. Many brittle stars are hermaphrodites; they often brood their eggs, usually in special chambers on their oral surfaces, but sometimes in the ovary or coelom. In these starfish and brittle stars, development is usually direct to the adult form, without passing through a bilateral larval stage. A few sea urchins and one species of sand dollar carry their eggs in cavities, or near their anus, holding them in place with their spines. Some sea cucumbers use their buccal tentacles to transfer their eggs to their underside or back, where they are retained. In a very small number of species, the eggs are retained in the coelom where they develop viviparously, later emerging through ruptures in the body wall. In some crinoids, the embryos develop in special breeding bags, where the eggs are held until sperm released by a male happens to find them.\nAsexual reproduction.\nOne species of seastar, \"Ophidiaster granifer\", reproduces asexually by parthenogenesis. In certain other asterozoans, adults reproduce asexually until they mature, then reproduce sexually. In most of these species, asexual reproduction is by transverse fission with the disc splitting in two. Both the lost disc area and the missing arms regrow, so an individual may have arms of varying lengths. During the period of regrowth, they have a few tiny arms and one large arm, and are thus often known as \"comets\".\nAdult sea cucumbers reproduce asexually by transverse fission. \"Holothuria parvula\" uses this method frequently, splitting into two a little in front of the midpoint. The two halves each regenerate their missing organs over a period of several months, but the missing genital organs are often very slow to develop.\nThe larvae of some echinoderms are capable of asexual reproduction. This has long been known to occur among starfish and brittle stars, but has more recently been observed in a sea cucumber, a sand dollar and a sea urchin. This may be by autotomising parts that develop into secondary larvae, by budding, or by splitting transversely. Autotomised parts or buds may develop directly into fully formed larvae, or may pass through a gastrula or even a blastula stage. New larvae can develop from the preoral hood (a mound like structure above the mouth), the side body wall, the postero-lateral arms, or their rear ends.\nCloning is costly to the larva both in resources and in development time. Larvae undergo this process when food is plentiful or temperature conditions are optimal. Cloning may occur to make use of the tissues that are normally lost during metamorphosis. The larvae of some sand dollars clone themselves when they detect dissolved fish mucus, indicating the presence of predators. Asexual reproduction produces many smaller larvae that escape better from planktivorous fish, implying that the mechanism may be an anti-predator adaptation.\nLarval development.\nDevelopment begins with a bilaterally symmetrical embryo, with a coeloblastula developing first. Gastrulation marks the opening of the \"second mouth\" that places echinoderms within the deuterostomes, and the mesoderm, which will host the skeleton, migrates inwards. The secondary body cavity, the coelom, forms by the partitioning of three body cavities. The larvae are often planktonic, but in some species the eggs are retained inside the female, while in some the female broods the larvae.\nThe larvae pass through several stages, which have specific names derived from the taxonomic names of the adults or from their appearance. For example, a sea urchin has an 'echinopluteus' larva while a brittle star has an 'ophiopluteus' larva. A starfish has a 'bipinnaria' larva, which develops into a multi-armed 'brachiolaria' larva. A sea cucumber's larva is an 'auricularia' while a crinoid's is a 'vitellaria'. All these larvae are bilaterally symmetrical and have bands of cilia with which they swim; some, usually known as 'pluteus' larvae, have arms. When fully developed, they settle on the seabed to undergo metamorphosis, and the larval arms and gut degenerate. The left-hand side of the larva develops into the oral surface of the juvenile, while the right side becomes the aboral surface. At this stage, the pentaradial symmetry develops.\nA plankton-eating larva, living and feeding in the water column, is considered to be the ancestral larval type for echinoderms, but in extant echinoderms, some 68% of species develop using a yolk-feeding larva. The provision of a yolk-sac means that smaller numbers of eggs are produced, the larvae have a shorter development period and a smaller dispersal potential, but a greater chance of survival.\nDistribution and habitat.\nEchinoderms are globally distributed in almost all depths, latitudes and environments in the ocean. Living echinoderms are known from between 0 to over 10,000 meters. Adults are mainly benthic, living on the seabed, whereas larvae are often pelagic, living as plankton in the open ocean. Some holothuroid adults such as \"Pelagothuria\" are pelagic. In the fossil record, some crinoids were pseudo-planktonic, attaching themselves to floating logs and debris. Some Paleozoic taxa displayed this life mode, before competition from organisms such as barnacles restricted the extent of the behaviour.\nMode of life.\nLocomotion.\nEchinoderms primarily use their tube feet to move about, though some sea urchins also use their spines. The tube feet typically have a tip shaped like a suction pad in which a vacuum can be created by contraction of muscles. This combines with some stickiness from the secretion of mucus to provide adhesion. The tube feet contract and relax in waves which move along the adherent surface, and the animal moves slowly along.\nBrittle stars are the most agile of the echinoderms. Any one of the arms can form the axis of symmetry, pointing either forwards or back. The animal then moves in a co-ordinated way, propelled by the other four arms. During locomotion, the propelling arms can made either snake-like or rowing movements. Starfish move using their tube feet, keeping their arms almost still, including in genera like \"Pycnopodia\" where the arms are flexible. The oral surface is covered with thousands of tube feet which move out of time with each other, but not in a metachronal rhythm; in some way, however, the tube feet are coordinated, as the animal glides steadily along. Some burrowing starfish have points rather than suckers on their tube feet and they are able to \"glide\" across the seabed at a faster rate.\nSea urchins use their tube feet to move around in a similar way to starfish. Some also use their articulated spines to push or lever themselves along or lift their oral surfaces off the substrate. If a sea urchin is overturned, it can extend its tube feet in one ambulacral area far enough to bring them within reach of the substrate and then successively attach feet from the adjoining area until it is righted. Some species bore into rock, usually by grinding away at the surface with their mouthparts.\nMost sea cucumber species move on the surface of the seabed or burrow through sand or mud using peristaltic movements; some have short tube feet on their under surface with which they can creep along in the manner of a starfish. Some species drag themselves along using their buccal tentacles, while others manage to swim with peristaltic movements or rhythmic flexing. Many live in cracks, hollows and burrows and hardly move at all. Some deep-water species are pelagic and can float in the water with webbed papillae forming sails or fins.\nThe majority of feather stars (also called Comatulida or \"unstalked crinoids\") and some stalked forms are motile. Several stalked crinoid species are sessile, attached permanently to the substratum. Movement in most sea lilies is limited to bending (their stems can bend) and rolling and unrolling their arms; a few species can relocate themselves on the seabed by crawling. Feather stars are unattached and usually live in crevices, under corals or inside sponges with their arms the only visible part. Some feather stars emerge at night and perch themselves on nearby eminences to better exploit food-bearing currents. Many species can \"walk\" across the seabed, raising their body with the help of their arms, or swim using their arms. Most species of feather stars, however, are largely sedentary, seldom moving far from their chosen place of concealment.\nFeeding.\nThe modes of feeding vary greatly between the different echinoderm taxa. Crinoids and some brittle stars tend to be passive filter-feeders, enmeshing suspended particles from passing water. Most sea urchins are grazers; sea cucumbers are deposit feeders; and the majority of starfish are active hunters.\nCrinoids catch food particles using the tube feet on their outspread pinnules, move them into the ambulacral grooves, wrap them in mucus, and convey them to the mouth using the cilia lining the grooves. The exact dietary requirements of crinoids have been little researched, but in the laboratory, they can be fed with diatoms.\nBasket stars are suspension feeders, raising their branched arms to collect zooplankton, while other brittle stars use several methods of feeding. Some are suspension feeders, securing food particles with mucus strands, spines or tube feet on their raised arms. Others are scavengers and detritus feeders. Others again are voracious carnivores and able to lasso their waterborne prey with a sudden encirclement by their flexible arms. The limbs then bend under the disc to transfer the food to the jaws and mouth.\nMany sea urchins feed on algae, often scraping off the thin layer of algae covering the surfaces of rocks with their specialised mouthparts known as Aristotle's lantern. Other species devour smaller organisms, which they may catch with their tube feet. They may also feed on dead fish and other animal matter. Sand dollars may perform suspension feeding and feed on phytoplankton, detritus, algal pieces and the bacterial layer surrounding grains of sand.\nSea cucumbers are often mobile deposit or suspension feeders, using their buccal podia to actively capture food and then stuffing the particles individually into their buccal cavities. Others ingest large quantities of sediment, absorb the organic matter and pass the indigestible mineral particles through their guts. In this way they disturb and process large volumes of substrate, often leaving characteristic ridges of sediment on the seabed. Some sea cucumbers live infaunally in burrows, anterior-end down and anus on the surface, swallowing sediment and passing it through their gut. Other burrowers live anterior-end up and wait for detritus to fall into the entrances of the burrows or rake in debris from the surface nearby with their buccal podia.\nNearly all starfish are detritus feeders or carnivores, though a few are suspension feeders. Small fish landing on the upper surface may be captured by pedicellariae and dead animal matter may be scavenged but the main prey items are living invertebrates, mostly bivalve molluscs. To feed on one of these, the starfish moves over it, attaches its tube feet and exerts pressure on the valves by arching its back. When a small gap between the valves is formed, the starfish inserts part of its stomach into the prey, excretes digestive enzymes and slowly liquefies the soft body parts. As the adductor muscle of the bivalve relaxes, more stomach is inserted and when digestion is complete, the stomach is returned to its usual position in the starfish with its now liquefied bivalve meal inside it. Other starfish evert the stomach to feed on sponges, sea anemones, corals, detritus and algal films.\nAntipredator defence.\nDespite their low nutrition value and the abundance of indigestible calcite, echinoderms are preyed upon by many organisms, including bony fish, sharks, eider ducks, gulls, crabs, gastropod molluscs, other echinoderms, sea otters, Arctic foxes and humans. Larger starfish prey on smaller ones; the great quantity of eggs and larva that they produce form part of the zooplankton, consumed by many marine creatures. Crinoids, on the other hand, are relatively free from predation.\nAntipredator defences include the presence of spines, toxins (inherent or delivered through the tube feet), and the discharge of sticky entangling threads by sea cucumbers. Although most echinoderm spines are blunt, those of the crown-of-thorns starfish are long and sharp and can cause a painful puncture wound as the epithelium covering them contains a toxin. Because of their catch connective tissue, which can change rapidly from a flaccid to a rigid state, echinoderms are very difficult to dislodge from crevices. Some sea cucumbers have a cluster of cuvierian tubules which can be ejected as long sticky threads from their anus to entangle and permanently disable an attacker. Sea cucumbers occasionally defend themselves by rupturing their body wall and discharging the gut and internal organs. Starfish and brittle stars may undergo autotomy when attacked, detaching an arm; this may distract the predator for long enough for the animal to escape. Some starfish species can swim away from danger.\nEcology.\nEchinoderms are numerous invertebrates whose adults play an important role in benthic ecosystems, while the larvae are a major component of the plankton. Among the ecological roles of adults are the grazing of sea urchins, the sediment processing of heart urchins, and the suspension and deposit feeding of crinoids and sea cucumbers. Some sea urchins can bore into solid rock, destabilising rock faces and releasing nutrients into the ocean. Coral reefs are also bored into in this way, but the rate of accretion of carbonate material is often greater than the erosion produced by the sea urchin. Echinoderms sequester about 0.1 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide per year as calcium carbonate, making them important contributors in the global carbon cycle.\nEchinoderms sometimes have large population swings which can transform ecosystems. In 1983, for example, the mass mortality of the tropical sea urchin \"Diadema antillarum\" in the Caribbean caused a change from a coral-dominated reef system to an alga-dominated one. Sea urchins are among the main herbivores on reefs and there is usually a fine balance between the urchins and the kelp and other algae on which they graze. A diminution of the numbers of predators (otters, lobsters and fish) can result in an increase in urchin numbers, causing overgrazing of kelp forests, resulting in an alga-denuded \"urchin barren\". On the Great Barrier Reef, an unexplained increase in the numbers of crown-of-thorns starfish (\"Acanthaster planci\"), which graze on living coral tissue, has greatly increased coral mortality and reduced coral reef biodiversity.\nTaxonomy and evolution.\nThe characteristics of adult echinoderms are the possession of a water vascular system with external tube feet and a stereom endoskeleton. \nStereom is a calcareous material consisting of ossicles connected by a mesh of collagen fibres, which is unique to this phylum.\nPhylogeny.\nEchinoderm phylogeny has long been a contentious subject. While the relationships among extant taxa are well-understood, there is no broadly accepted consensus regarding the phylum's origins or the relationships among its extinct groups. Echinoderm evolution shows a high degree of homoplasy, meaning that many features have evolved multiple times independently. This means that many features initially assumed to indicate a genetic connection do not, in fact, do so, which has obscured the true relationships of various groups.\nExternal phylogeny.\nEchinoderms are bilaterians, meaning that their ancestors were mirror-symmetric. Among the bilaterians, they belong to the deuterostome division, meaning that the blastopore, the first opening to form during embryo development, becomes the anus instead of the mouth.\nEchinoderms are the sister group of the Hemichordata, with which they form the crown group Ambulacraria. Two taxa of uncertain placement, Vetulocystida and \"Yanjiahella\", have each been proposed as either stem-group echinoderms or stem-group ambulacrarians. Vetulocystids have also been proposed as stem-group chordates, while \"Yanjiahella\" has also been proposed to be a stem-group hemichordate.\nThe Ambulacrarian context of the echinoderms is shown below, simplified from Li et al. 2023, with the possible ambulacrarian placements of the uncertain taxa shown with dashed lines and question marks:\nInternal phylogeny: extant classes.\nThe extant echinoderms consist of the Crinoidea and the Eleutherozoa, the latter of which is divided into the Asterozoa and the Echinozoa.\nInternal phylogeny: total group.\nThe lack of a consensus cladistic phylogeny incorporating extinct echinoderm groups has resulted in the continued use of terms from Linnaean taxonomies, even when the named taxa are known to be paraphyletic and/or polyphyletic.\nLinnaean taxonomies.\nThree taxonomies introduced nearly all of the traditional subphyla and class divisions that continue to be referenced in cladistic work:\nOther proposed classes not included at that rank in any of the above taxonomies include:\nThere are also several common alternative names involving homalozoans:\nCladograms.\nAccording to 2024 review, there are two main schools of thought regarding echinoderm phylogeny: One that sees pentaradiality as a plesiomorphic trait of the phylum, and another that considers it a derived trait (apomorphy).\nNote that neither cladogram shown below includes all of the traditional classes, or even all of the classes mentioned in accompanying text.\nSupporters of pentaradiality as an initial condition of the phylum note that radial forms are the first uncontested echinoderms to appear in the fossil record. They also define homologies of echinoderm anatomy based on a division of the skeleton into two parts: those that are or are not associated with the water vascular system.\nThe following cladogram is based on David &amp; Mooi (1999) and David, Lefebvre, Mooi, and Parsley (2000), although note that discussion of the cladogram in the latter paper notes that cinctans and ctenocystoids could instead emerge from within diploporites rather than eocrinoids:\nIn this theory, the controversial Ediacaran fossil \"Arkarua\" is tentatively placed as the sister to all other echinoderms. Helicoplacoidea, Edrioasteroidea, and the entirety of Blastozoa join it in the stem group. Pelmatozoa, Eocrinoidea, and Cystoidea are shown to be paraphyletic while Homalozoa is polyphyletic. The Stylophora are included within Crinozoa, with the discussion text noting that they are expected to be \"well within the crinozoan clade, above [later than] the first forms to which the term \u2018\u2018crinoid\u2019\u2019 is usually applied.\"\nThose who find pentaradiality to be derived incorporate the recently discovered fossils \"Ctenoimbricata\" (seen as a possible sister to all other echinoderms) and \"Helicocystis\" (seen as bridging the triradial helicoplacoids and the pentaradial crown group). They cite research indicating that the early appearance of pentaradial forms is likely due to an incomplete fossil record, as well as multiple studies showing non-radial forms as an early stem group, to argue that this is phylogeny represents an emerging consensus. They reject \"Arkarua\" as an echinoderm due to its lack of stereom and possession of true pentaradiality instead of the 2-1-2 pseudo-pentaradiality seen in all early forms.\nThe following cladogram is based on Rahman &amp; Zamora (2024), incorporating class and subphylum names from the text:\nHere, Homalozoa (with uncertain placement of Stylophora) is shown to be a paraphyletic assemblage along the stem group, followed by Helicoplacoidea and then \"Helicocystis\" as the sister of the crown group. The details of Blastozoa vs Crinozoa are not addressed, as they are represented only by the classes Eocrinoidea and Crinoidea, respectively, and the overall nature of Pelmatozoa remains unresolved. The four-way polytomy including the Eleutherozoa and Crinoidea shows either \"Camptostroma\" or \"Gogia\" or both could prove to be outside of the crown group.\nFossil history.\nEchinoderms have a rich fossil record due to their mineralized endoskeletons.\nPossible early echinoderms.\nThe three oldest known candidate echinoderms all lack stereom and other echinoderm apomorphies, making their inclusion in the phylum controversial.\nThe oldest potential echinoderm fossil is \"Arkarua\" from the late Ediacaran of Australia \"circa\" 555 Ma. These fossils are disc-like, with radial ridges on the rim and a five-pointed central depression marked with radial lines. However, the fossils have no stereom or internal structure indicating a water vascular system, so they cannot be conclusively identified. Additionally, all known early pentaradial echinoderms are pseudo-pentaradial in a 2-1-2 pattern, with true pentaradiality as seen in \"Arkarua\" not seen until the emergence of the Eleutherozoa.\nThe next possible echinoderms are the vetulocystids, which date to the early to mid Cambrian, 541\u2013501 Ma. While the youngest vetulocystid, \"Thylacocercus\", displays some characteristics that could be intermediate between older vetulocystids and \"Yanjiahella\", its discoverers consider vetulocystids more likely to be stem ambulacrarians than stem echinoderms.\n\"Yanjiahella\", from the Fortunian (\"circa\" 539\u2013529 Ma), is unlike the older fossils in that it has a plated theca, albeit one without evidence of stereom. To some, this is a reason to place it as a stem ambulacrarian or stem hemichordate. Others argue that absence of evidence for stereom is not evidence of absence, and consider a stem echinoderm position more likely.\nEchinoderms in the Cambrian and Ordovician.\nThe first universally accepted echinoderms appear in the Lower Cambrian period; asterozoans appeared in the Ordovician, while the crinoids were a dominant group in the Paleozoic.\nIt is hypothesised that the ancestor of all echinoderms was a simple, motile, bilaterally symmetrical animal with a mouth, gut and anus. This ancestral organism adopted an attached mode of life with suspension feeding, and developed radial symmetry. Even so, the larvae of all echinoderms are bilaterally symmetrical, and all develop radial symmetry at metamorphosis. Like their ancestor, the starfish and crinoids still attach themselves to the seabed while changing to their adult form.\nThe first known echinoderms were non-motile, but evolved into animals able to move freely. These soon developed endoskeletal plates with stereom structure, and external ciliary grooves for feeding. The Paleozoic echinoderms were globular, attached to the substrate and were orientated with their oral surfaces facing upwards. These early echinoderms had ambulacral grooves extending down the side of the body, fringed on either side by brachioles, like the pinnules of a modern crinoid. Eventually, the mobile eleutherozoans reversed their orientation to become mouth-downward. Before this happened, the podia probably had a feeding function, as they do in the crinoids today. The locomotor function of the podia came later, when the re-orientation of the mouth brought the podia into contact with the substrate for the first time.\nUse by humans.\nAs food and medicine.\nIn 2019, 129,052 tonnes of echinoderms were harvested. The majority of these were sea cucumbers (59,262 tonnes) and sea urchins (66,341 tonnes). These are used mainly for food, but also in traditional Chinese medicine. Sea cucumbers are considered a delicacy in some countries of southeast Asia; as such, they are in imminent danger of being over-harvested. Popular species include the pineapple roller \"Thelenota ananas\" (\"susuhan\") and the red sea cucumber \"Holothuria edulis\". These and other species are colloquially known as \"b\u00eache de mer\" or \"trepang\" in China and Indonesia. The sea cucumbers are boiled for twenty minutes and then dried both naturally and later over a fire which gives them a smoky tang. In China, they are used as a basis for gelatinous soups and stews. Both male and female gonads of sea urchins are consumed, particularly in Japan and France. The taste is described as soft and melting, like a mixture of seafood and fruit. Sea urchin breeding trials have been undertaken to try to compensate for overexploitation.\nIn research.\nBecause of their robust larval growth, sea urchins are widely used in research, particularly as model organisms in developmental biology and ecotoxicology. \"Strongylocentrotus purpuratus\" and \"Arbacia punctulata\" are used for this purpose in embryological studies. The large size and the transparency of the eggs enables the observation of sperm cells in the process of fertilising ova. The arm regeneration potential of brittle stars is being studied in connection with understanding and treating neurodegenerative diseases in humans. Genomic data relevant to echinoderm model organisms are collected in Echinobase. Currently, there are four species of echinoderms fully supported (gene pages, BLAST, JBrowse tracks, genome downloads) including \"Strongylocentrotus purpuratus\" (purple sea urchin), \"Lytechinus variegatus\" (green sea urchin), \"Patiria miniata\" (bat star) and \"Acanthaster planci\" (crown-of-thorns sea star). Partially supported species (no gene pages) include \"Lytechinus pictus\" (painted sea urchin), \"Asterias rubens\" (sugar star) and \"Anneissia japonica\" (feather star crinoid).\nOther uses.\nThe calcareous tests or shells of echinoderms are used as a source of lime by farmers in areas where limestone is unavailable and some are used in the manufacture of fish meal. 4,000 tons of the animals are used annually for these purposes. This trade is often carried out in conjunction with shellfish farmers, for whom the starfish pose a major threat by eating their cultured stock. Other uses for the starfish they recover include the manufacture of animal feed, composting and the preparation of dried specimens for the arts and craft trade.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Once treated as a separate phylum, they are now considered to belong to Annelida. Annelids typically have their bodies divided into segments, but echiurans have secondarily lost their segmentation. The majority of echiurans live in burrows in soft sediment in shallow water, but some live in rock crevices or under boulders, and there are also deep sea forms. More than 230 species have been described.\nSpoon worms are cylindrical, soft-bodied animals usually possessing a non-retractable proboscis which can be rolled into a scoop-shape to feed. In some species the proboscis is ribbon-like, longer than the trunk and may have a forked tip. Spoon worms vary in size from less than a centimetre in length to more than a metre.\nMost are deposit feeders, collecting detritus from the sea floor. Fossils of these worms are seldom found and the earliest known fossil specimen is from the Middle Ordovician.\nTaxonomy and evolution.\nThe spoonworm \"Echiurus echiurus\" was first described by the Prussian naturalist Peter Simon Pallas in 1766; he placed it in the earth worm genus \"Lumbricus\". In the mid-nineteenth century Echiura was placed, alongside Sipuncula and Priapulida, in the now defunct class Gephyrea (meaning a \"bridge\") in Annelida, because it was believed that they provided a link between annelids and holothurians. In 1898, Sedgwick raised the sipunculids and priapulids to phylum status but considered Echiuroids to be a class of the Annelida. During the early 1900s, a biologist named Jon Stanton Whited devoted his working life to study the echiurans and classify many of its different species. In 1940, after the American marine biologist W. W. Newby had studied the embryology and development of \"Urechis caupo\", he raised the group to phylum status.\nThey are now universally considered to represent derived annelid worms; as such, their ancestors were segmented worms but echiurans have secondarily lost their segmentation. Their presumed sister group is the Capitellidae.\nHaving no hard parts, these worms are seldom found as fossils. One of the oldest known unambiguous examples is \"Coprinoscolex ellogimus\" from the Mazon Creek fossil beds in Illinois, dating back to the Middle Pennsylvanian period. This exhibits a proboscis, cigar\u2010shaped body and convoluted gut, and shows that already at that time, echiurans were unsegmented and were essentially similar to modern forms. However, U-shaped burrow fossils that could be Echiuran have been found dating back to the Cambrian, and an Ordovician species of thalassematid named \"Llwygarua suzannae\" was found in the Castle Bank lagerst\u00e4tte.\nAnatomy.\nSpoon worms vary in size from the giant \"Ikeda taenioides\", nearly long with its proboscis extended, to the minute \"Lissomyema\", measuring just . \nTheir bodies are generally cylindrical with two wider regions separated by a narrower region. There is a large extendible, scoop-shaped proboscis in front of the mouth which gives the animals their common name. This proboscis resembles that of peanut worms but it cannot be retracted into the body. It houses a brain and may be homologous to the prostomium of other annelids. The proboscis has rolled-in margins and a groove on the ventral surface. The distal end is sometimes forked. The proboscis can be very long; in the case of the Japanese species \"Ikeda taenioides\", the proboscis can be long while the body is only . Even smaller species like \"Bonellia\" can have a proboscis a metre (yard) long. The proboscis is used primarily for feeding. Respiration takes place through the proboscis and the body wall, with some larger species also using cloacal irrigation. In this process, water is pumped into and out of the rear end of the gut through the anus.\nCompared with other annelids, echiurans have relatively few setae (bristles). In most species, there are just two, located on the underside of the body just behind the proboscis, and often hooked. In others, such as \"Echiurus\", there are also further setae near the posterior end of the animal. Unlike most annelids, adult echiurans have no trace of segmentation. Most echiurans are a dull grey or brown but a few species are more brightly coloured, such as the translucent green \"Listriolobus pelodes\".\nThe body wall is muscular. It surrounds a large coelom which leads to a long looped intestine with an anus at the rear tip of the body. The intestine is highly coiled, giving it a considerable length in relation to the size of the animal. A pair of simple or branched diverticula are connected to the rectum. These are lined with numerous minute ciliated funnels that open directly into the body cavity, and are presumed to be excretory organs. The proboscis has a small coelomic cavity separated from the main coelom by a septum.\nEchiurans do not have a distinct respiratory system, absorbing oxygen through the body wall of both the trunk and proboscis, and through the cloaca in \"Urechis\". Although some species lack a blood vascular system, where it is present, it resembles that of other annelids. The blood is essentially colourless, although some haemoglobin-containing cells are present in the coelomic fluid of the main body cavity. There can be anywhere from one to over a hundred metanephridia for excreting nitrogenous waste, which typically open near the anterior end of the animal. The nervous system consists of a brain near the base of the proboscis, and a ventral nerve cord running the length of the body. Aside from the absence of segmentation, this is a similar arrangement to that of other annelids. Echiurans do not have any eyes or other distinct sense organs, but the proboscis is presumed to have a tactile sensory function.\nDistribution and habitat.\nEchiurans are exclusively marine and the majority of species live in the Atlantic Ocean. They are mostly infaunal, occupying burrows in the seabed, either in the lower intertidal zone or the shallow subtidal (e.g. the genera \"Echiurus\", \"Urechis\", and \"Ikeda\"). Others live in holes in coral heads, and in rock crevices. Some are found in deep waters including at abyssal depths; in fact more than half the 70 species in Bonelliidae live below . They often congregate in sediments with high concentrations of organic matter. One species, \"Lissomyema mellita\", which lives off the southeastern coast of the US, inhabits the tests (exoskeleton) of dead sand dollars. When the worm is very small, it enters the test and later becomes too large to leave.\nIn the 1970s, the spoon worm \"Listriolobus pelodes\" was found on the continental shelf off Los Angeles in numbers of up to 1,500 per square metre (11 square feet) near sewage outlets. The burrowing and feeding activities of these worms churned up and aerated the sediment and promoted a balanced ecosystem with a more diverse fauna than would otherwise have existed in this heavily polluted area.\nBehaviour.\nA spoon worm can move about on the surface by extending its proboscis and grasping some object before pulling its body forward. Some worms, such as \"Echiurus\", can leave the substrate entirely, swimming by use of the proboscis and contractions of the body wall.\nDigging behaviour has been studied in \"Echiurus echiurus\". When burrowing, the proboscis is raised and folded backwards and plays no part in the digging process. The front of the trunk is shaped into a wedge and pushed forward, with the two anterior chaetae (hooked chitinous bristles) being driven into the sediment. Next the rear end of the trunk is drawn forward and the posterior chaetae anchor it in place. These manoeuvres are repeated and the worm slowly digs its way forwards and downwards. It takes about forty minutes for the worm to disappear from view. The burrow descends diagonally and then flattens out, and it may be a metre or so long before ascending vertically to the surface.\nSpoon worms are typically detritivores, extending the flexible and mobile proboscis and gathering organic particles that are within reach. Some species can expand the proboscis by ten times its contracted length. The proboscis is moved by the action of cilia on the lower (ventral) surface \"creeping\" it forward. When food particles are encountered, the sides of the proboscis curl inward to form a ciliated channel.\nA worm such as \"Echiurus\", living in the sediment, extends its proboscis from the rim of its burrow with the ventral side on the substrate. The surface of the proboscis is well equipped with mucous glands to which food particles adhere. The mucus is bundled into boluses by cilia and these are passed along the feeding groove by cilia to the mouth. The proboscis is periodically withdrawn into the burrow and later extended in another direction.\n\"Urechidae\", another group of tube-dwellers, has become filter feeders. It has a short proboscis and a ring of mucous glands at the front of its body. It expands its muscular body wall to deposit a ring of mucus on the burrow wall then retreats backwards, exuding mucus as it goes and spinning a mucus net. It then draws water through the burrow by peristaltic contractions and food particles stick to the net. When this is sufficiently clogged up, the spoon worm moves forward along its burrow devouring the net and the trapped particles. This process is then repeated and in a nutrient-rich area may take only a few minutes to complete. Large particles are squeezed out of the net and eaten by other invertebrates living commensally in the burrow. These typically include a small crab, a scale worm and often a fish lurking just inside the back entrance.\n\"Ochetostoma erythrogrammon\" obtains its food by another method. it has two vertical burrows connected by a horizontal one. Stretching out its proboscis across the substrate it shovels material into its mouth before separating the edible particles. It can lengthen the proboscis dramatically while exploring new areas and periodically reverses its orientation in the burrow so as to use the back entrance to feed. Other spoon worms live concealed in rock crevices, empty gastropod shells, sand dollar tests and similar places, extending their proboscises into the open water to feed. Some are scavengers or detritivores, while others are interface grazers and some are suspension feeders.\nWhile the proboscis of a burrowing spoon worm is on the surface it is at risk of predation by bottom-feeding fish. In some species, the proboscis will autotomise (break off) if attacked and the worm will regenerate a proboscis over the course of a few weeks. In a study in California, one of the most commonly found dietary items of the leopard shark was found to be the tube-dwelling innkeeper worm (\"Urechis caupo\") which it extracted from the sediment by suction.\nReproduction.\nEchiurans are dioecious, with separate male and female individuals. The gonads are associated with the peritoneal membrane lining the body cavity, into which they release the gametes. The sperm and eggs complete their maturation in the body cavity, before being stored in genital sacs, which are specialised metanephridia. At spawning time, the genital sacs contract and the gametes are squeezed into the water column through pores on the worm's ventral surface. Fertilization is external.\nFertilization is internal in the sexual dimorphic order Bonelliida, which has dwarf males living inside the female. Members of the order Echiurida have external fertilization and are sexual monomorphic.\nFertilized eggs hatch into free-swimming trochophore larvae. In some species, the larva briefly develops a segmented body before transforming into the adult body plan, supporting the theory that echiurans evolved from segmented ancestors resembling more typical annelids.\nThe species \"Bonellia viridis\", also remarkable for the possible antibiotic properties of bonellin, the green chemical in its skin, is unusual for its extreme sexual dimorphism. Females are typically in body length, excluding the proboscis, but the males are only long, and spend their adult lives within the genital sac of the female.\nCulinary use.\nSpoon worms are eaten in East and Southeast Asia. In South Korea fat innkeeper worms (\"Urechis unicinctus\") are known as \"gaebul\" (\uac1c\ubd88). These worms are much prized and are often available at markets and stalls, chopped up and served raw in combination with raw sea cucumber, sea squirt and sea urchin, dressed with chili sauce and soy sauce. They are also eaten as a fermented product known as \"gaebul-jeot\".\nList of families.\nAccording to the World Register of Marine Species:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are mostly benthic and live within the periphyton, the layer of tiny organisms and detritus that is found on the seabed and the beds of other water bodies. The majority live on and between particles of sediment or on other submerged surfaces, but a few species are terrestrial and live on land in the film of water surrounding grains of soil. Gastrotrichs are divided into two orders, the Macrodasyida which are marine (except for two species), and the Chaetonotida, some of which are marine and some freshwater. As of 2019, more than 860 species of gastrotrichs have been described.\nGastrotrichs have a simple body plan with a head region, with a brain and sensory organs, and a trunk with a simple gut and the reproductive organs. They have adhesive glands with which they can anchor themselves to the substrate and cilia with which they move around. They feed on detritus, sucking up organic particles with their muscular pharynx. They are hermaphrodites, the marine species producing eggs which develop directly into miniature adults. The freshwater species are parthenogenetic, producing unfertilised eggs, and at least one species is viviparous. Gastrotrichs mature with great rapidity and have lifespans of only a few days.\nEtymology and taxonomy.\nThe name \"gastrotrich\" comes from Greek \u03b3\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1, \"gaster\" 'stomach' and \u03b8\u03c1\u03af\u03be, \"thrix\" 'hair'. The name was coined by the Russian zoologist \u00c9lie Metchnikoff in 1865. The common name \"hairyback\" apparently arises from a mistranslation of \"gastrotrich\".\nThe relationship of gastrotrichs to other phyla is unclear. Morphology suggests that they are close to the Gnathostomulida, the Rotifera, or the Nematoda. On the other hand, genetic studies place them as close relatives of the Platyhelminthes, the Ecdysozoa or the Lophotrochozoa. As of 2019, more than 860 species have been described. The phylum contains a single class, divided into two orders: the Macrodasyida and the Chaetonotida. Edward Ruppert \"et al.\" report that the Macrodasyida are wholly marine, but two rare and poorly known species, \"Marinellina flagellata\" and \"Redudasys fornerise\", are known from fresh water. The Chaetonotida comprises both marine and freshwater species.\nAnatomy.\nGastrotrichs vary in size from about in body length. They are bilaterally symmetrical, with a transparent strap-shaped or bowling pin-shaped body, arched dorsally and flattened ventrally. The anterior end is not clearly defined as a head but contains the sense organs, brain and pharynx. Cilia are found around the mouth and on the ventral surface of the head and body. The trunk contains the gut and the reproductive organs. At the posterior end of the body are two projections with cement glands that serve in adhesion. This is a double-gland system where one gland secretes the glue and another secretes a de-adhesive agent to sever the connection. In the Macrodasyida, there are additional adhesive glands at the anterior end and on the sides of the body.\nThe body wall consists of a cuticle, an epidermis and longitudinal and circular bands of muscle fibres. In some primitive species, each epidermal cell has a single cilium, a feature shared only by the gnathostomulans. The whole ventral surface of the animal may be ciliated or the cilia may be arranged in rows, patches or transverse bands. The cuticle is locally thickened in some gastrotrichs and forms scales, hooks and spines. There is no coelom (body cavity) and the interior of the animal is filled with poorly differentiated connective tissue. In the macrodasyidans, Y-shaped cells, each containing a vacuole, surround the gut and may function as a hydrostatic skeleton.\nThe mouth is at the anterior end and opens into an elongated muscular pharynx with a triangular or Y-shaped lumen, lined by myoepithelial cells. The pharynx opens into a cylindrical intestine, which is lined with glandular and digestive cells. The anus is located on the ventral surface close to the posterior of the body. In some species, there are pores in the pharynx opening to the ventral surface; these contain valves and may allow egestion of any excess water swallowed while feeding.\nIn the chaetonotidans, the excretory system consists of a single pair of protonephridia, which open through separate pores on the lateral underside of the animal, usually in the midsection of the body. In the macrodasyidans, there are several pairs of these opening along the side of the body. Nitrogenous waste is probably excreted through the body wall, as part of respiration, and the protonephridia are believed to function mainly in osmoregulation. Unusually, the protonephridia do not take the form of flame cells, but, instead, the excretory cells consist of a skirt surrounding a series of cytoplasmic rods that in turn enclose a central flagellum. These cells, termed \"cyrtocytes\", connect to a single outlet cell which passes the excreted material into the protonephridial duct.\nAs is typical for such small animals, there are no respiratory or circulatory organs. The nervous system is relatively simple. The brain consists of two ganglia, one on either side of the pharynx, connected by a commissure. From these lead a pair of nerve cords which run along either side of the body beside the longitudinal muscle bands. The primary sensory organs are the bristles and ciliated tufts of the body surface which function as mechanoreceptors. There are also ciliated pits on the head, simple ciliary photoreceptors and fleshy appendages which act as chemoreceptors.\nDistribution and habitat.\nGastrotrichs are cosmopolitan in distribution. They inhabit the interstitial spaces between particles in marine and freshwater environments, the surfaces of aquatic plants and other submerged objects and the surface film of water surrounding soil particles on land. A very few species can also live in the water column as planktonic animals. They are also found in stagnant pools and anaerobic mud, where they thrive even in the presence of hydrogen sulfide. When pools dry up they can survive periods of desiccation as eggs, and some species are capable of forming cysts in harsh conditions. In marine sediments they have been known to reach 364 individuals per making them the third most common invertebrate in the sediment after nematodes and harpacticoid copepods. In freshwater they may reach a density of 158 individuals per and are the fifth most abundant group of invertebrates in the sediment.\nBehaviour and ecology.\nIn marine and freshwater environments, gastrotrichs form part of the benthic community. They are detritivores and are microphagous: they feed by sucking small dead or living organic materials, diatoms, bacteria and small protozoa into their mouths by the muscular action of the pharynx. They are themselves eaten by turbellarians and other small macrofauna.\nLike many microscopic animals, gastrotrich locomotion is primarily powered by hydrostatics, but movement occurs through different methods in different members of the group. Chaetonotids only have adhesive glands at the back and, in them, locomotion typically proceeds in a smooth gliding manner; the whole body is propelled forward by the rhythmic action of the cilia on the ventral surface. In the pelagic chaetonotid genus \"Stylochaeta\", however, movement proceeds in jerks as the long, muscle-activated spines are forced rhythmically towards the side of the body. By contrast, with chaetonotids, macrodasyidans typically have multiple adhesive glands and move forward with a creeping action similar to that of a \"looper\" caterpillar. In response to a threat, the head and trunk can be rapidly pulled backwards, or the creeping movement can be reversed. Muscular action is important when the animal turns sideways and during copulation, when two individuals twine around each other.\nReproduction and lifespan.\nGastrotrich reproduction and reproductive behaviour has been little studied. That of macrodasiyds probably most represents that of the ancestral lineage and these more primitive gastrotrichs are simultaneous hermaphrodites, possessing both male and female sex organs. There is generally a single pair of gonads, the anterior portion of which contains sperm-producing cells and the posterior portion producing ova. The sperm is sometimes packaged in spermatophores and is released through male gonopores that open, often temporarily, on the underside of the animal, roughly two-thirds of the way along the body. A copulatory organ on the tail collects the sperm and transfers it to the partner's seminal receptacle through the female gonopore. Details of the process and the behaviour involved vary with the species, and there is a range of different accessory reproductive organs. During copulation, the \"male\" individual uses his copulatory organ to transfer sperm to his partner's gonopore and fertilisation is internal. The fertilised eggs are released by rupture of the body wall which afterwards repairs itself. As is the case in most protostomes, development of the embryo is determinate, with each cell destined to become a specific part of the animal's body. At least one species of gastrotrich, \"Urodasys viviparus\", is viviparous.\nMany species of chaetotonid gastrotrichs reproduce entirely by parthenogenesis. In these species, the male portions of the reproductive system are degenerate and non-functional, or, in many cases, entirely absent. Though the eggs have a diameter of less than 50 \u03bcm, they are still very large in comparison with the animals' size. Some species are capable of laying eggs that remain dormant during times of desiccation or low temperatures; these species, however, are also able to produce regular eggs, which hatch in one to four days, when environmental conditions are more favourable. The eggs of all gastrotrichs undergo direct development and hatch into miniature versions of the adult. The young typically reach sexual maturity in about three days. In the laboratory, \"Lepidodermella squamatum\" has lived for up to forty days, producing four or five eggs during the first ten days of life.\nGastrotrichs demonstrate eutely, each species having an invariant genetically fixed number of cells as adults. Cell division ceases at the end of embryonic development and further growth is solely due to cell enlargement.\nClassification.\nGastrotricha is divided into two orders and a number of families:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They appear in the Lower or Middle Cambrian and include two main classes: Enteropneusta (acorn worms), and Pterobranchia. A third class, Planctosphaeroidea, is known only from the larva of a single species, \"Planctosphaera pelagica\". The class Graptolithina, formerly considered extinct, is now placed within the pterobranchs, represented by a single living genus \"Rhabdopleura\".\nAcorn worms are solitary worm-shaped organisms. They generally live in burrows (the earliest secreted tubes) and are deposit feeders, but some species are pharyngeal filter feeders, while the family are free living detritivores. Many are well known for their production and accumulation of various halogenated phenols and pyrroles. Pterobranchs are filter-feeders, mostly colonial, living in a collagenous tubular structure called a coenecium.\nThe discovery of the stem group hemichordate \"Gyaltsenglossus\" shows that early hemichordates combined aspects of the two morphologically disparate classes.\nAnatomy.\nThe body plan of hemichordates is characterized by a muscular organization. The anteroposterior axis is divided into three parts: the anterior prosome, the intermediate mesosome, and the posterior metasome.\nThe body of acorn worms is worm-shaped and divided into an anterior proboscis, an intermediate collar, and a posterior trunk. The proboscis is a muscular and ciliated organ used in locomotion and in the collection and transport of food particles. The mouth is located between the proboscis and the collar. The trunk is the longest part of the animal. It contains the pharynx, which is perforated with gill slits (or pharyngeal slits), the oesophagus, a long intestine, and a terminal anus. It also contains the gonads. A post-anal tail is present in juvenile members of the acorn worm family Harrimaniidae.\nThe prosome of pterobranchs is specialized into a muscular and ciliated cephalic shield used in locomotion and in secreting the coenecium. The mesosome extends into one pair (in the genus \"Rhabdopleura\") or several pairs (in the genus \"Cephalodiscus\") of tentaculated arms used in filter feeding. The metasome, or trunk, contains a looped digestive tract, gonads, and extends into a contractile stalk that connects individuals to the other members of the colony, produced by asexual budding. In the genus \"Cephalodiscus\", asexually produced individuals stay attached to the contractile stalk of the parent individual until completing their development. In the genus \"Rhabdopleura\", zooids are permanently connected to the rest of the colony via a common stolon system.\nSome species biomineralize in calcium carbonate.\nThey have a diverticulum of the foregut called a stomochord, previously thought to be related to the chordate notochord, but this is most likely the result of convergent evolution rather than a homology. \nNeural system.\nA hollow neural tube exists among some species (at least in early life), probably a primitive trait that they share with the common ancestor of Chordata and the rest of the deuterostomes. Hemichordates have a nerve net and longitudinal nerves, but no brain.\nThe nervous system of adult enteropneusts consists of:\nCirculatory system.\nHemichordates have an open circulatory system. The heart vesicle is located dorsally within the proboscis complex, and does not contain any blood. Instead it moves the blood indirectly by pulsating against the dorsal blood vessel.\nDevelopment.\nTogether with the echinoderms, the hemichordates form the Ambulacraria, which are the closest extant phylogenetic relatives of chordates. Thus these marine worms are of great interest for the study of the origins of chordate development. There are several species of hemichordates, with a moderate diversity of embryological development among these species. Hemichordates are classically known to develop in two ways, both directly and indirectly. Hemichordates are a phylum composed of two classes, the enteropneusts and the pterobranchs, both being forms of marine worm.\nThe enteropneusts have two developmental strategies: direct and indirect development. The indirect developmental strategy includes an extended pelagic plankotrophic tornaria larval stage, which means that this hemichordate exists in a larval stage that feeds on plankton before turning into an adult worm. The pterobranch genus most extensively studied is \"Rhabdopleura\" from Plymouth, England and from Bermuda.\nThe following details the development of two popularly studied species of the Hemichordata phylum \"Saccoglossus kowalevskii\" and \"Ptychodera flava\". \"Saccoglossus kowalevskii\" is a direct developer and \"Ptychodera flava\" is an indirect developer. Most of what has been detailed in hemichordate development has come from hemichordates that develop directly.\n\"Ptychodera flava\".\n\"P. flava's\" early cleavage pattern is similar to that of \"S. kowalevskii\". The first and second cleavages from the single cell zygote of \"P. flava\" are equal cleavages, are orthogonal to each other and both include the animal and vegetal poles of the embryo. The third cleavage is equal and equatorial so that the embryo has four blastomeres both in the vegetal and the animal pole. The fourth division occurs mainly in blastomeres in the animal pole, which divide transversally as well as equally to make eight blastomeres. The four vegetal blastomeres divide equatorially but unequally and they give rise to four big macromeres and four smaller micromeres. Once this fourth division has occurred, the embryo has reached a 16 cell stage. \"P. flava\" has a 16 cell embryo with four vegetal micromeres, eight animal mesomeres and four larger macromeres. Further divisions occur until \"P. flava\" finishes the blastula stage and goes on to gastrulation. The animal mesomeres of \"P. flava\" go on to give rise to the larva's ectoderm, animal blastomeres also appear to give rise to these structures though the exact contribution varies from embryo to embryo. The macromeres give rise to the posterior larval ectoderm and the vegetal micromeres give rise to the internal endomesodermal tissues. Studies done on the potential of the embryo at different stages have shown that at both the two and four cell stage of development \"P. flava\" blastomeres can go on to give rise to a tornaria larvae, so fates of these embryonic cells don't seem to be established till after this stage.\n\"Saccoglossus kowalevskii\".\nEggs of \"S. kowalevskii\" are oval in shape and become spherical in shape after fertilization. The first cleavage occurs from the animal to the vegetal pole and usually is equal though very often can also be unequal. The second cleavage to reach the embryos four cell stage also occurs from the animal to the vegetal pole in an approximately equal fashion though like the first cleavage it's possible to have an unequal division. The eight cell stage cleavage is latitudinal; so that each cell from the four cell stage goes on to make two cells. The fourth division occurs first in the cells of the animal pole, which end up making eight blastomeres (mesomeres) that are not radially symmetric, then the four vegetal pole blastomeres divide to make a level of four large blastomeres (macromeres) and four very small blastomeres (micromeres). The fifth cleavage occurs first in the animal cells and then in the vegetal cells to give a 32 cell blastomere. The sixth cleavage occurs in a similar order and completes a 64 cell stage, finally the seventh cleavage marks the end of the cleavage stage with a blastula with 128 blastomeres. This structure goes on to go through gastrulation movements which will determine the body plan of the resulting gill slit larva, this larva will ultimately give rise to the marine acorn worm.\nGenetic control of dorsal-ventral hemichordate patterning.\nMuch of the genetic work done on hemichordates has been done to make comparison with chordates, so many of the genetic markers identified in this group are also found in chordates or are homologous to chordates in some way. Studies of this nature have been done particularly on \"S. kowalevskii\", and like chordates \"S. kowalevskii\" has dorsalizing bmp-like factors such as \"bmp 2/4\", which is homologous to \"Drosophila\"'s decapentaplegic dpp. The expression of \"bmp2/4\" begins at the onset of gastrulation on the ectodermal side of the embryo, and as gastrulation progresses its expression is narrowed down to the dorsal midline but is not expressed in the post-anal tail. The bmp antagonist chordin is also expressed in the endoderm of gastrulating \"S. kowalevskii\". Besides these well known dorsalizing factors, further molecules known to be involved in dorsal ventral patterning are also present in \"S. kowalevskii\", such as a netrin that groups with netrin gene class 1 and 2. Netrin is important in patterning of the neural system in chordates, as well as is the molecule Shh, but \"S. kowalevskii\" was only found to have one hh gene and it appears to be expressed in a region that is uncommon to where it is usually expressed in developing chordates along the ventral midline.\nClassification.\nHemichordata are divided into two classes: the Enteropneusta, commonly called acorn worms, and the Pterobranchia, which includes the graptolites. A third class, Planctosphaeroidea, is proposed based on a single species known only from larvae. The phylum contains about 120 living species. Hemichordata appears to be sister to the Echinodermata as Ambulacraria; Xenoturbellida may be basal to that grouping. Pterobranchia may be derived from within Enteropneusta, making Enteropneusta paraphyletic. It is possible that the extinct organism \"Etacystis\" is a member of the Hemichordata, either within or with close affinity to the Pterobranchia.\nThere are 130 described species of Hemichordata and many new species are being discovered, especially in the deep sea.\nPhylogeny.\nA phylogenetic tree showing the position of the hemichordates is:\nThe internal relationships within the hemichordates are shown below. The tree is based on 16S +18S rRNA sequence data and phylogenomic studies from multiple sources.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "43147", "revid": "48643156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43147", "title": "Acanthocephala", "text": "Group of parasitic thorny-headed worms\nAcanthocephala (Greek , ' 'thorn' + , ' 'head') is a group of parasitic worms known as acanthocephalans, thorny-headed worms, or spiny-headed worms, characterized by the presence of an eversible proboscis, armed with spines, which it uses to pierce and hold the gut wall of its host. Acanthocephalans have complex life cycles, involving at least two hosts, which may include invertebrates, fish, amphibians, birds, and mammals. About 1,420 species have been described.\nThe Acanthocephala were long thought to be a discrete phylum. Recent genome analysis has shown that they are descended from, and should be considered as, highly modified rotifers. This unified taxon is sometimes known as Syndermata, or simply as Rotifera, with the acanthocephalans described as a subclass of a rotifer class Hemirotatoria.\nHistory.\nThe earliest recognisable description of Acanthocephala \u2013 a worm with a proboscis armed with hooks \u2013 was made by Italian author Francesco Redi (1684). In 1771, Joseph Koelreuter proposed the name Acanthocephala. Philipp Ludwig Statius M\u00fcller independently called them \"Echinorhynchus\" in 1776. Karl Rudolphi in 1809 formally named them Acanthocephala.\nEvolutionary history.\nThe oldest known member of the group is the Middle Jurassic (living approximately 165 million years ago) taxon \"Juracanthocephalus daohugouensis\" known from the Jiulongshan Formation (China). The fossil record of the group also includes eggs found in a coprolite from the Late Cretaceous Bauru Group of Brazil, around 70\u201380 million years old, likely from a crocodyliform. The group may have originated substantially earlier.\nPhylogeny.\nAcanthocephalans are highly adapted to a parasitic mode of life, and have lost many organs and structures through evolutionary processes. This makes determining relationships with other higher taxa through morphological comparison problematic. A 2016 phylogenetic analysis of the gene order in the mitochondria suggests that Seisonidea and Acanthocephala are sister clades and that the Eurotatoria are the sister clade to this group, producing the cladogram below.\nMorphology.\nSeveral morphological characteristics distinguish acanthocephalans from other phyla of parasitic worms.\nDigestion.\nAcanthocephalans lack a mouth or alimentary canal. This is a feature they share with the cestoda (tapeworms), although the two groups are not closely related. Adult stages live in the intestines of their host and uptake nutrients which have been digested by the host, directly, through their body surface. The acanthocephalans lack an excretory system, although some species have been shown to possess flame cells (protonephridia).\nProboscis.\nThe most notable feature of the acanthocephala is the presence of an anterior, protrudable proboscis that is usually covered with spiny hooks (hence the common name: thorny or spiny headed worm). The proboscis bears rings of recurved hooks arranged in horizontal rows, and it is by means of these hooks that the animal attaches itself to the tissues of its host. The hooks may be of two or three shapes, usually: longer, more slender hooks are arranged along the length of the proboscis, with several rows of more sturdy, shorter nasal hooks around the base of the proboscis. The proboscis is used to pierce the gut wall of the final host, and hold the parasite fast while it completes its life cycle.\nLike the body, the proboscis is hollow, and its cavity is separated from the body cavity by a \"septum\" or \"proboscis sheath\". Traversing the cavity of the proboscis are muscle-strands inserted into the tip of the proboscis at one end and into the septum at the other. Their contraction causes the proboscis to be invaginated into its cavity. The whole proboscis apparatus can also be, at least partially, withdrawn into the body cavity, and this is effected by two retractor muscles which run from the posterior aspect of the septum to the body wall.\nSome of the acanthocephalans (perforating acanthocephalans) can insert their proboscis in the intestine of the host and open the way to the abdominal cavity.\nSize.\nThe size of these animals varies greatly, ranging from a few millimetres in length to \"Macracanthorhynchus hirudinaceus\", which measures from . A curious feature shared by both larva and adult is the large size of many of the cells, e.g. the nerve cells and cells forming the uterine bell. Polyploidy is common, with up to 343n having been recorded in some species.\nSkin.\nThe body surface of the acanthocephala is peculiar. Externally, the skin has a thin tegument covering the epidermis, which consists of a syncytium with no cell walls. The syncytium is traversed by a series of branching tubules containing fluid and is controlled by a few wandering, amoeboid nuclei. Inside the syncytium is an irregular layer of circular muscle fibres, and within this again some rather scattered longitudinal fibres; there is no endothelium. In their micro-structure the muscular fibres resemble those of nematodes.\nExcept for the absence of the longitudinal fibres the skin of the proboscis resembles that of the body, but the fluid-containing tubules of the proboscis are shut off from those of the body. The canals of the proboscis open into a circular vessel which runs round its base. From the circular canal two sac-like projections called the \"lemnisci\" run into the cavity of the body, alongside the proboscis cavity. Each consists of a prolongation of the syncytial material of the proboscis skin, penetrated by canals and sheathed with a muscular coat. They seem to act as reservoirs into which the fluid which is used to keep the proboscis \"erect\" can withdraw when it is retracted, and from which the fluid can be driven out when it is wished to expand the proboscis.\nNervous system.\nThe central ganglion of the nervous system lies behind the proboscis sheath or septum. It innervates the proboscis and projects two stout trunks posteriorly which supply the body. Each of these trunks is surrounded by muscles, and this nerve-muscle complex is called a \"retinaculum\". In the male at least there is also a genital ganglion. Some scattered papillae may possibly be sense-organs.\nLife cycles.\nAcanthocephalans have complex life cycles, involving a number of hosts, for both developmental and resting stages. Complete life cycles have been worked out for only 25 species.\nReproduction.\nThe Acanthocephala are dioecious (an individual organism is either male or female). There is a structure called the \"genital ligament\" which runs from the posterior end of the proboscis sheath to the posterior end of the body. In the male, two testes lie on either side of this. Each opens in a vas deferens which bears three diverticula or \"vesiculae seminales\". The male also possesses three pairs of cement glands, found behind the testes, which pour their secretions through a duct into the vasa deferentia. These unite and end in a penis which opens posteriorly.\nIn the female, the ovaries are found, like the testes, as rounded bodies along the ligament. From the ovaries, masses of ova dehisce into the body cavity, floating in its fluids for fertilization by male's sperm. After fertilization, each egg contains a developing embryo. (These embryos hatch into first stage larva.) The fertilized eggs are brought into the uterus by actions of the \"uterine bell\", a funnel like opening continuous with the uterus. At the junction of the bell and the uterus there is a second, smaller opening situated dorsally. The bell \"swallows\" the matured eggs and passes them on into the uterus. (Immature embryos are passed back into the body cavity through the dorsal opening.) From the uterus, mature eggs leave the female's body via her oviduct, pass into the host's alimentary canal and are expelled from the host's body within feces.\nRelease.\nHaving been expelled by the female, the acanthocephalan egg is released along with the feces of the host. For development to occur, the egg, containing the acanthor, needs to be ingested by an arthropod, usually a crustacean (there is one known life cycle which uses a mollusc as a first intermediate host). Inside the intermediate host, the acanthor is released from the egg and develops into an acanthella. It then penetrates the gut wall, moves into the body cavity, encysts, and begins transformation into the infective cystacanth stage. This form has all the organs of the adult save the reproductive ones.\nThe parasite is released when the first intermediate host is ingested. This can be by a suitable final host, in which case the cystacanth develops into a mature adult, or by a paratenic host, in which the parasite again forms a cyst. When consumed by a suitable final host, the cycstacant \"excysts\", everts its proboscis and pierces the gut wall. It then feeds, grows and develops its sexual organs. Adult worms then mate. The male uses the excretions of its \"cement glands\" to plug the vagina of the female, preventing subsequent matings from occurring. Embryos develop inside the female, and the life cycle repeats.\nHost control.\nThorny-headed worms begin their life cycle inside invertebrates that reside in marine or freshwater systems. One example is \"Polymorphus paradoxus.\" \"Gammarus lacustris\", a small crustacean that inhabits ponds and rivers, is one invertebrate that \"P. paradoxus\" may occupy; ducks are one of the definitive hosts.\nThis crustacean is preyed on by ducks and hides by avoiding light and staying away from the surface. However, infection by \"P. paradoxus\" changes its behavior and appearance in a number of ways that increase its chance of being eaten. First, infection significantly reduces \"G. lacustris\"'s photophobia; as a result, it becomes attracted toward light and swims to the surface. Second, an infected organism will even go so far as to find a rock or a plant on the surface, clamp its mouth down, and latch on, making it easy prey for the duck. Finally, infection reduces the pigment distribution and amount in \"G. lacustris,\" causing the host to turn blue; unlike their normal brown colour, this makes the crustacean stand out and increases the chance the duck will see it.\nExperiments have shown that altered serotonin levels are likely responsible for at least some of these changes in behaviour. One experiment found that serotonin induces clinging behavior in \"G. lacustris\" similar to that seen in infected organisms. Another showed that infected \"G. lacustris\" had approximately 3 times as many serotonin-producing sites in its ventral nerve cord. Furthermore, experiments in closely-related species of \"Polymorphus\" and \"Pomphorhynchus\" infecting other \"Gammarus\" species confirmed this relation: infected organisms were considerably more attracted to light and had higher serotonin levels, while the phototropism could be duplicated by injections of serotonin.\nEffects on hosts.\n\"Polymorphus\" spp. are parasites of seabirds, particularly the eider duck (\"Somateria mollissima\"). Heavy infections of up to 750 parasites per bird are common, causing ulceration to the gut, disease and seasonal mortality. Recent research has suggested that there is no evidence of pathogenicity of \"Polymorphus\" spp. to intermediate crab hosts. The cystacanth stage is long lived and probably remains infectious throughout the life of the crab. In freshwater systems, acanthocephalans have also been shown to accumulate organic micropollutants at concentrations far higher than their crustacean hosts, potentially reducing host pollutant burdens and acting as biological pollutant sinks.\nEconomic impact.\nAcanthocephalosis, a disease caused by \"Acanthacephalus\" infection, is prevalent in aquaculture, occurring in Atlantic salmon, rainbow and brown trout, tilapia, and tambaqui. Increasing occurrence in Brazilian farming of tambaqui has been reported, and in 2003 \"Acanthacephalus\" was first reported in cultured red snapper in Taiwan.\nThe life cycle of \"Polymorphus\" spp. normally occurs between sea ducks (e.g. eiders and scoters) and small crabs. Infections found in commercial-sized lobsters in Canada were probably acquired from crabs that form an important dietary item of lobsters. Cystacanths occurring in lobsters can cause economic loss to fishermen. There are no known methods of prevention or control.\nHuman infections.\nAlthough they rarely infect humans, worms in the phylum Acanthocephala cause the disease acanthocephaliasis in humans. The earliest known infection was found in a prehistoric man in Utah. This infection was dated to 1869 \u00b1 160 BC. The species involved was thought to be \"Moniliformis clarki\" which is still common in the area.\nThe first report of an isolate in historic times was by Lambl in 1859 when he isolated \"Macracanthorhynchus hirudinaceus\" from a child in Prague. Lindemann in 1865 reported that this organism was commonly isolated in Russia. The reason for this was discovered by Schneider in 1871 when he found that an intermediate host, the scarabaeid beetle grub, was commonly eaten raw.\nThe first report of clinical symptoms was by Calandruccio who in 1888 while in Italy infected himself by ingesting larvae. He reported gastrointestinal disturbances and shed eggs in two weeks. Subsequent natural infections have since been reported.\nEight species have been isolated from humans to date. \"Moniliformis moniliformis\" is the most common isolate. Other isolates include \"Acanthocephalus bufonis\" and \"Corynosoma strumosum\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Their sizes range from 100\u00a0\u03bcm to \"ca.\"\u20091 mm.\nThey are characterised by a protective outer case called a lorica and their habitat is in the spaces between marine gravel to which they attach themselves. The phylum was discovered in 1983 by R.M. Kristensen, near Roscoff, France. They are among the most recently discovered groups of animals. They attach themselves quite firmly to the substrate, and hence remained undiscovered for so long. The first specimen was collected in the 1970s, and described in 1983. They are found at all depths, in different sediment types, and in all latitudes.\nMorphology.\nThe animals have a head, mouth, and digestive system, as well as the lorica. The head (which contains the mouth and the brain), a trunk region surrounded by six plates that make up the 'lorica' or corselet and \u2013 in between these two \u2013 the neck region. Loricifera have a well developed brain and each scalid is individually connected to the brain by nerves.\nThe armor-like lorica consists of a protective external shell or case of encircling plicae. There is no circulatory system and no endocrine system. Many of the larvae are acoelomate, with some adults being pseudocoelomate, and some remaining acoelomate. Development is generally direct, though there are so-called Higgins larvae, which differ from adults in several respects. As adults, the animals are gonochoric. Very complex and plastic life cycles of pliciloricids include also paedogenetic stages with different forms of parthenogenetic reproduction. Most Loricifera are dioecious, meaning there are males and females. However, there are a few species known to be hermaphroditic, which means they contain both male and female reproductive organs. Fossils have been dated to the late Cambrian.\nTaxonomic affinity.\nMorphological studies have traditionally placed the phylum in the Vinctiplicata with the Priapulida; this plus the Kinorhyncha constitutes the taxon Scalidophora. The three phyla share four characters in common \u2013 chitinous cuticle, rings of scalids on the introvert, flosculi, and two rings of introvert retracts. However, despite a 2015 study showing the phylum's closest relatives being the Panarthropoda, a 2022 study again showed that it belonged to the Scalidophora and told that further, more comprehensive genetic tests will be required to find its actual position in Ecdysozoa.\nEvolutionary history.\nThe loriciferans are believed to be miniaturized descendants of a larger organism, perhaps resembling the Cambrian fossil \"Sirilorica\". However, the fossil record of the microscopic non-mineralized group is (perhaps unsurprisingly) scarce, so it is difficult to trace out the evolutionary history of the phylum in any detail.\nThe 2017 discovery of the Cambrian \"Eolorica deadwoodensis\" may shed some light on the group's history.\nIn anoxic environments.\nThree species of Loricifera have been found in the oxygen-free sediments at the bottom of the L'Atalante basin in Mediterranean Sea, more than 3,000\u00a0meters down, the first multicellular organisms known to spend their entire lives in an anoxic environment. Initially, it was thought that they are able to do this because their mitochondria act like hydrogenosomes, allowing them to respire anaerobically. However, by 2021, questions arose as to whether or not they have mitochondria.\nThe newly reported animals complete their life cycle in the total absence of light and oxygen, and they are less than a millimetre in size. They were collected from a deep basin at the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea, where they inhabit a nearly salt-saturated brine that, because of its density (&gt;\u00a01.2\u00a0g/cm3), does not mix with the waters above. As a consequence, this environment is completely anoxic and, due to the activity of sulfate reducers, contains sulphide at a concentration of 2.9\u00a0mM. Despite such harsh conditions, this anoxic and sulphidic environment is teeming with microbial life, both chemosynthetic prokaryotes that are primary producers, and a broad diversity of eukaryotic heterotrophs at the next trophic level.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
