It explores the illegal drug trade from several perspectives: users, enforcers, politicians, and traffickers. Their stories are edited together throughout the film, although most characters do not meet each other. The film is an adaptation of the 1989 British Channel 4 television series \"Traffik\". The film stars an international ensemble cast, including Don Cheadle, Benicio del Toro, Michael Douglas, Erika Christensen, Luis Guzm\u00e1n, Dennis Quaid, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Jacob Vargas, Tomas Milian, Topher Grace, James Brolin, Steven Bauer, and Benjamin Bratt. It features both English and Spanish-language dialogue.\n20th Century Fox, the original financiers of the film, demanded that Harrison Ford play a leading role and that significant changes to the screenplay be made. Soderbergh refused and proposed the script to other major Hollywood studios; it was rejected because of the three-hour running time and the subject matter\u2014\"Traffic\" is more of a political film than most Hollywood productions. USA Films, however, liked the project from the start and offered the filmmakers more money than Fox. Soderbergh operated the camera himself and adopted a distinctive color grade for each story line so that audiences could tell them apart.\n\"Traffic\" was released in the United States on December 27, 2000, and received critical acclaim for Soderbergh's direction, the film's style, complexity, messages, and the cast's performances (particularly del Toro's). \"Traffic\" earned numerous awards, including four Oscars (from five nominations): Best Director for Steven Soderbergh, Best Supporting Actor for Benicio del Toro, Best Adapted Screenplay for Stephen Gaghan and Best Film Editing for Stephen Mirrione. It was also a commercial success with a worldwide box-office revenue total of $207.5 million, well above its estimated $48 million budget.\nIn 2004, USA Network ran a miniseries\u2014also called \"Traffic\"\u2014based on the film and the 1989 British television series.\nPlot.\nMexico story line.\nIn Mexico, police officers Javier Rodriguez and Manolo Sanchez stop a drug transport. General Salazar, a high-ranking Mexican official, interrupts their arrest to offer Javier a special assignment: apprehending Francisco Flores, a hitman for the Tijuana Cartel, headed by the Obreg\u00f3n brothers.\nIn Tijuana, under torture, Flores gives Salazar the names of Obreg\u00f3n cartel members, who are arrested. Javier and Salazar's efforts cripple the Obreg\u00f3ns' cocaine outfit, but Javier discovers that Salazar is a pawn of the rival Ju\u00e1rez Cartel; Salazar's anti-drug campaign is a charade to wipe out the Ju\u00e1rez Cartel's competitors.\nSanchez attempts to sell information about Salazar's true affiliation to the Drug Enforcement Administration, but Salazar has him murdered in the desert with Javier forced to watch. Javier arranges a deal with the DEA to testify against Salazar in exchange for electricity in his neighborhood to keep local children from being tempted by street gangs and crime. Salazar's secrets are revealed, and he is arrested.\nJavier makes a statement to the media about the widespread corruption in the police force and army. Later, Javier watches as children play baseball at night in their new stadium.\nWakefield story line.\nRobert Wakefield, a conservative Ohio judge, is appointed to head the President's Office of National Drug Control Policy as drug czar, though he is warned that the war on drugs is unwinnable. Meanwhile, Robert's teenage daughter Caroline has been using cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin, developing a drug addiction after her boyfriend Seth introduces her to freebasing. Caroline, Seth, and their friend Vanessa are arrested when they try to dump an overdosing fellow student at a hospital. Robert and his wife Barbara struggle to deal with Caroline's addiction, which Barbara has secretly known about for months.\nRobert finds himself caught between his demanding new position and difficult family life. Visiting Mexico, he is encouraged by Salazar's successful efforts in hurting the Obreg\u00f3n brothers. Returning to Ohio, Robert learns that Caroline has run away to Cincinnati after stealing money from her parents to pay for drugs.\nDragging Seth along, Robert searches Cincinnati for his daughter. After a drug dealer who is prostituting Caroline refuses to reveal her whereabouts, Robert breaks into a seedy hotel room and finds a semi-conscious Caroline in the company of an older man. In Washington, D.C. to present a \"10-point plan\" to win the war on drugs, Robert falters halfway through the speech, and tells the press that the war on drugs implies a war on one's own family, which he cannot endorse. Later, Robert and Barbara attend a Narcotics Anonymous meeting with Caroline, telling the other attendees that they are \"here to listen\".\nAyala/DEA story line.\nIn San Diego, an undercover DEA investigation led by Montel Gordon and Ray Castro leads to the arrest of Eduardo Ruiz, a dealer posing as a fisherman. Ruiz gives up his boss, drug lord Carl Ayala, the Obreg\u00f3ns' biggest distributor in the United States. Ayala is indicted by a tough prosecutor, hand-selected by Robert Wakefield to send a message to the cartels.\nAs Ayala's trial begins, his pregnant wife Helena learns of her husband's true profession from his associate, Arnie Metzger. Facing the prospect of life imprisonment for her husband and death threats against her child, Helena hires Flores to assassinate Ruiz and end the trial \"nolle prosequi\". Flores plants a car bomb, but he is killed by a sniper in retaliation for his cooperation with General Salazar, and the bomb meant to kill Ruiz instead kills Agent Castro.\nKnowing Ruiz will soon testify, Helena makes a deal with Juan Obreg\u00f3n, who forgives the Ayala family's debt and has Ruiz poisoned. Ayala is released, and he deduces that Metzger accepted $3 million to inform on Ruiz to the FBI and facilitate Ayala's downfall; Metzger is later visited by armed men. Soon after Ayala's release, Gordon bursts into his homecoming celebration and is forced out. Having planted a listening device under Ayala's desk, Gordon smiles as he walks away.\nRelationship to actual events.\nSome aspects of the plotline are based on actual people and events:\nAt one point in the film, an El Paso Intelligence Center agent tells Robert his position, official in charge of drug control, does not exist in Mexico. As noted in the original script, a Director of the \"Instituto Nacional para el Combate a las Drogas\" was created by the Attorney General of Mexico in 1996.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Benicio del Toro as Javier Rodr\u00edguez Rodr\u00edguez, officer of the Mexican Federal Police and police partner of Manolo S\u00e1nchez\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nSteven Soderbergh had been interested in making a film about the drug wars for some time but did not want to make one about addicts. Producer Laura Bickford obtained the rights to the British television miniseries \"Traffik\" (1989) and liked its structure. Soderbergh, who had seen the miniseries in 1990, started looking for a screenwriter to adapt it into a film. They read a script by Stephen Gaghan called \"Havoc\", about upper-class white kids in Palisades High School doing drugs and getting involved with gangs. Soderbergh approached Gaghan to work on his film but found he was already developing a film about drugs for producer/director Edward Zwick. Bickford and Soderbergh approached Zwick, who agreed to merge the two projects and come aboard as a producer.\n\"Traffic\" was originally going to be distributed by 20th Century Fox, but it was put into turnaround unless actor Harrison Ford agreed to star. Soderbergh began shopping the film to other studios, but when Ford suddenly showed interest in \"Traffic\", Fox's interest in the film was renewed; the studio took it out of turnaround. Fox CEO Bill Mechanic championed the film, but he departed from the studio by the time the first draft was finished. It went back into turnaround. Mechanic had also wanted to make some changes to the script, but Soderbergh disagreed and decided to shop the film to other major studios. They all turned him down because they were not confident in the prospects of a three-hour film about drugs, according to Gaghan. USA Films, however, had wanted to take on the movie from the first time Soderbergh approached them. They provided the filmmakers with a $46 million budget, a considerable increase from the $25 million which Fox offered.\nScreenplay.\nSoderbergh had \"conceptual discussions\" with Gaghan while he was shooting \"The Limey\" in October 1998; they finished the outline before he went off to shoot \"Erin Brockovich\". After Soderbergh was finished with that film, Gaghan had written a first draft in six weeks that was 165 pages long. After the film was approved for production, Soderbergh and Gaghan met two separate times for three days to reformat the script. The draft they shot had 163 pages with 135 speaking parts and featured seven cities. The film shortens the story line of the original miniseries; a significant character arc of a farmer is taken out, and the Pakistani plotline is replaced with one set in Mexico.\nCasting.\nHarrison Ford was initially considered for the role of Robert Wakefield in January 2000 but would have had to take a significant cut in his usual $20 million salary. Ford met with Soderbergh to flesh out the character. Gaghan agreed to rework the role, adding several scenes to the screenplay. On February 20, Ford turned down the role, and the filmmakers brought it back to Michael Douglas, who had turned down an earlier draft. He liked the changes and agreed to star, which helped greenlight the project. Gaghan believes Ford turned down the role because he wanted to \"reconnect with his action fans\".\nThe filmmakers sent out letters to many politicians, both Democrat and Republican, asking them to make cameo appearances in the film. Several of the scenes had already been shot using actors in these roles, but the filmmakers went back and reshot those scenes when real politicians agreed to be in the film. Those who agreed, including U.S. Senators Harry Reid, Barbara Boxer, Orrin Hatch, Charles Grassley, and Don Nickles, and Massachusetts governor Bill Weld, were filmed in a scene that was entirely improvised.\nPre-production.\nThe project was obtained from Fox by Initial Entertainment Group and was sold to USA Films by IEG for North American rights only. Steven Soderbergh never approached USA Films, and Initial Entertainment Group fully funded the film.\nAfter Fox dropped the film in early 2000, and before USA Films expressed interest, Soderbergh paid for pre-production with his own money. USA Films agreed to give him the final cut on \"Traffic\" and also agreed to his term that all the Mexican characters would speak Spanish while talking to each other. This meant that almost all of Benicio del Toro's dialogue would be subtitled. Once the studio realized this, they suggested that his scenes be shot in English and Spanish, but Soderbergh and del Toro rejected the suggestion. Del Toro, a native of Puerto Rico, was worried that another actor would be brought in and re-record his dialogue in English after he had worked hard to master Mexican inflections and improve his Spanish vocabulary. Del Toro remembers: \"Can you imagine? You do the whole movie, bust your butt to get it as realistic as possible, and someone dubs your voice? I said, 'No way. Over my dead body.' Steven was like, 'Don't worry. It's not gonna happen.'\" The director fought for subtitles for the Mexico scenes, arguing that if the characters did not speak Spanish, the film would have no integrity and would not convincingly portray what he described as the \"impenetrability of another culture\".\nThe filmmakers went to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and U.S. Customs early on with the script; they told them that they were trying to present as detailed and accurate a picture of the current drug war as possible. The DEA and Customs pointed out inaccuracies in the script. In addition, they gave the production team access to the border checkpoint to Mexico, as shown in the film during the scene in which Wakefield and his people talk with border officials. Despite the assistance, the DEA did not try to influence the script's content. Soderbergh said \"Traffic\" had influences from the films of Richard Lester and Jean-Luc Godard. He also spent time analyzing \"The Battle of Algiers\" and \"Z\", which, according to the director, had the feeling that the footage was \"caught\" and not staged. Another inspiration was Alan J. Pakula's film \"All the President's Men\" because of its ability to tackle serious issues while being entertaining. In the opening credits of the film, Soderbergh tried to replicate the typeface from \"All the President's Men\" and the placement on-screen at the bottom left-hand corner. Analyzing this film helped the director deal with the large cast and working in many different locations for \"Traffic\".\nPrincipal photography.\nHalf of the first day's footage came out overexposed and unusable. Before the financiers or studio bosses knew about the problem, Soderbergh was already doing reshoots. The insurers made him agree that any further mishaps resulting in additional filming would come from the director's pocket. Soderbergh shot in various cities in California, Ohio, and Texas, on a 54-day schedule and came in $2 million under budget. The director acted as his cinematographer under the pseudonym Peter Andrews and operated the camera himself to \"get as close to the movie as I can\" and to eliminate the distance between the actors and himself. Soderbergh drew inspiration from the cinema verite style of Ken Loach's films, studying the framing of scenes, the distance of the camera to the actors, lens length, and the tightness of eyelines depending on the position of a character. Soderbergh remembers, \"I noticed that there's a space that's inviolate, that if you get within something, you cross the edge into a more theatrical aesthetic as opposed to a documentary aesthetic\". Most of the day was spent shooting because a lot of the film was shot with available light.\nFor the hand-held camera footage, Soderbergh used Panavision Millennium XLs that were smaller and lighter than previous cameras and allowed him to move freely. He adopted a distinctive look for each to tell the three stories apart. For Robert Wakefield's story, Soderbergh used tungsten film with no filter for a cold, monochrome blue feel. For Helena Ayala's story, Soderbergh used diffusion filters, flashing the film and overexposing it for a warmer feel. For Javier Rodriguez's story, the director used tobacco filters and a 45-degree shutter angle whenever possible to produce a strobe-like sharp feeling. Then, he took the entire film through an Ektachrome step, which increased the contrast and grain significantly. He wanted different looks for each story because the audience had to keep track of many characters and absorb a lot of information, and he did not want them to have to figure out which story they were watching.\nBenicio del Toro had significant input into certain parts of the film; for example, he suggested a more straightforward, concise way of depicting his character kidnapping Francisco Flores that Soderbergh ended up using. The director cut a scene from the screenplay in which Robert Wakefield smokes crack after finding it in his daughter's bedroom. After rehearsing this scene with the actors, he felt that the character would not do it; after consulting with Gaghan, the screenwriter agreed, and the filmmakers cut the scene shortly before it was scheduled to be shot.\nRancho Bernardo, Balboa Park, downtown San Diego and La Jolla were utilized as the environment for the film.\nPost-production.\nThe first cut of \"Traffic\" ran three hours and ten minutes. Soderbergh cut it to two hours and twenty minutes. Early on, there were concerns that the film might get an NC-17 rating, and he was prepared to release it with that rating, but the MPAA assigned it an R.\nReception.\nBox office performance.\n\"Traffic\" was given a limited release on December 27, 2000, in four theaters where it grossed US$ on its opening weekend. It was given a wide release on January 5, 2001, in 1,510 theaters, grossing $15.5 million on its opening weekend. The film made $124.1 million in North America and $83.4 million in foreign markets for a worldwide total of $207.5 million, well above its estimated $46 million budget.\nCritical response.\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 93% based on 223 reviews, with an average rating of 8/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"Soderbergh successfully pulls off the highly ambitious \"Traffic\", a movie with three different stories and a very large cast. The issues of ethics are gray rather than black-and-white, with no clear-cut good guys. Terrific acting all around.\" On Metacritic, the film has received an average score of 86 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.\nFilm critic Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars, and wrote: \"The movie is powerful precisely because it doesn't preach. It is so restrained that at one moment\u2014the judge's final speech\u2014I wanted one more sentence, making a point, but the movie lets us supply that thought for ourselves\". Stephen Holden, in his review for \"The New York Times\", wrote: \"\"Traffic\" is an utterly gripping, edge-of-your-seat thriller. Or rather it is several interwoven thrillers, each with its own tense rhythm and explosive payoff\". In his review for \"The New York Observer\", Andrew Sarris wrote: \"\"Traffic\" marks [Soderbergh] definitively as an enormous talent, one who never lets us guess what he's going to do next. The promise of \"Sex, Lies, and Videotape\" has been fulfilled\".\n\"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the film an \"A\" rating and praised Benicio del Toro's performance, which critic Owen Gleiberman called, \"haunting in his understatement, [it] becomes the film's quietly awakening moral center\". Desson Howe, in his review for the \"Washington Post\", wrote: \"Soderbergh and screenwriter Stephen Gaghan, who based this on a British television miniseries of the same name, have created an often exhilarating, soup-to-nuts expos\u00e9 of the world's most lucrative trade\". In his review for \"Rolling Stone\", Peter Travers wrote: \"The hand-held camerawork \u2013 Soderbergh himself did the holding\u2014provides a documentary feel that rivets attention\". However, Richard Schickel of \"Time\", in a rare negative review, finds the film's biggest weakness to be that it contains the \"cliches of a hundred crime movies\" before concluding that \"\"Traffic\", for all its earnestness, does not work. It leaves one feeling restless and dissatisfied\". In an interview, director Ingmar Bergman lauded the film as \"amazing\".\nAccolades.\nSteven Soderbergh received dual nominations for Best Director that year for both \"Erin Brockovich\" and \"Traffic\", winning the award for the latter.\nTop ten lists.\n\"Traffic\" appeared on several critics' top ten lists for 2000. Some of the notable top-ten list appearances are:\nHome media.\nIn the United States, the film was released on DVD on May 28, 2002, by The Criterion Collection. In Australia, \"Traffic\" was released on DVD by Village Roadshow, with an MA15+ rating. Despite the Australian packaging stating the length to be 124 minutes, the actual DVD version is just over 141 minutes long. It was released on Blu-ray by Universal Pictures in April 2010 in a 1.85:1 aspect ratio. It was released on Blu-ray by Criterion in January 2012, featuring a new transfer in a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "37602", "revid": "50872472", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37602", "title": "Eagle", "text": "Large bird of prey\nEagle is the common name for certain large birds of prey within the family of the Accipitridae. While on a genetic level, only the subfamily Aquilinae comprises \"true eagles\", many other species are commonly referred to as eagles, such as the bald eagle, and the term generally carries no taxonomic weight. Most of the 68 species of eagles are from Eurasia and Africa. Outside this area, just 14 species can be found\u2014two in North America, nine in Central and South America, and three in Australia.\nEagles are not a natural group but denote essentially any kind of bird of prey large enough to hunt sizeable (about 50\u00a0cm long or more overall) vertebrates.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"eagle\" is borrowed into English from Old French \"aigle\", ultimately from Latin \"aquila\". It is cognate with terms such as French \"aigle\", Portuguese \"\u00e1guia\" and Spanish \"\u00e1guila\". Historically, the native English term for eagle was \"ern\" (), derived from Proto-Germanic *arnuz, and thus cognate with other synonymous words in Germanic languages such as German \"Aar\" and Dutch \"arend\", Swedish \"\u00f6rn\" and Gothic \ud800\udf30\ud800\udf42\ud800\udf30 (\"\"). The term \"ern\" or \"erne\" is still used in Modern English in reference to some larger species of eagle, in particular the fish eagles. While some ornithologists may favor this term as a way to distinguish fish eagles from true eagles, all species of fish eagle (such as the bald eagle and white-tailed eagle) are still commonly referred to as \"eagles\".\nDescription.\nEagles are large, powerfully-built birds of prey, with heavy heads and beaks. Even the smallest eagles, such as the booted eagle (\"Hieraaetus pennatus\"), which is comparable in size to a common buzzard (\"Buteo buteo\") or red-tailed hawk (\"B. jamaicensis\"), have relatively longer and more evenly broad wings, and more direct, faster flight, despite the reduced size of their aerodynamic feathers. Most eagles are larger than any other raptors, apart from some vultures. The smallest species of eagle is the Great Nicobar serpent eagle (\"Spilornis klossi\"), at and . The largest species are discussed below. Like all birds of prey, eagles have very large hooked beaks for ripping flesh from their prey, strong, muscular legs, and powerful talons.\nThe beak is typically heavier than that of most other birds of prey. Eagles' eyes are extremely powerful. It is estimated that the wedge-tailed eagle has a visual acuity twice that of a typical human. This acuity enables eagles to spot potential prey from a very long distance. This keen eyesight is primarily attributed to their extremely large pupils which ensure minimal diffraction (scattering) of the incoming light. Like most diurnal raptors, eagles have little ability to see ultraviolet light. The female of all known species of eagles is larger than the male.\nEagles normally build their nests, called eyries, in tall trees or on high cliffs. Many species lay two eggs, but the older, larger chick frequently kills its younger sibling once it has hatched. The parents take no action to stop the killing.\nIt is said that eagles fly above clouds but this is not true. Eagles fly during storms and glide from the wind's pressure. This saves the bird's energy. \nDue to the size and power of many eagle species, they are ranked at the top of the food chain as apex predators in the avian world. The type of prey varies by genus. The \"Haliaeetus\" and \"Icthyophaga\" eagles prefer to capture fish, though the species in the former often capture various animals, especially other water birds, and are powerful kleptoparasites of other birds. The snake and serpent eagles of the genera \"Circaetus\", \"Terathopius\", and \"Spilornis\" predominantly prey on the great diversity of snakes found in the tropics of Africa and Asia. The eagles of the genus \"Aquila\" are often the top birds of prey in open habitats, taking almost any medium-sized vertebrate they can catch. Where \"Aquila\" eagles are absent, other eagles, such as the buteonine black-chested buzzard-eagle of South America, may assume the position of top raptorial predator in open areas. Many other eagles, including the species-rich genus \"Spizaetus\", live predominantly in woodlands and forests. These eagles often target various arboreal or ground-dwelling mammals and birds, which are often unsuspectingly ambushed in such dense, knotty environments. Hunting techniques differ among the species and genera, with some individual eagles having engaged in quite varied techniques based on their environment and prey at any given time. Most eagles grab prey without landing and take flight with it, so the prey can be carried to a perch and torn apart.\nThe bald eagle is noted for having flown with the heaviest load verified to be carried by any flying bird, since one eagle flew with a mule deer fawn. However, a few eagles may target prey considerably heavier than themselves; such prey is too heavy to fly with, thus it is either eaten at the site of the kill or taken in pieces back to a perch or nest. Golden and crowned eagles have killed ungulates weighing up to and a martial eagle even killed a duiker, 7\u20138 times heavier than the preying eagle. Authors on birds David Allen Sibley, Pete Dunne, and Clay Sutton described the behavioral difference between hunting eagles and other birds of prey thus (in this case the bald and golden eagles as compared to other North American raptors):\nThey have at least one singular characteristic. It has been observed that most birds of prey look back over their shoulders before striking prey (or shortly thereafter); predation is after all a two-edged sword. All hawks seem to have this habit, from the smallest kestrel to the largest Ferruginous \u2013 but not the Eagles.\nAmong the eagles are some of the largest birds of prey: only the condors and some of the Old World vultures are markedly larger. It is regularly debated which should be considered the largest species of eagle. They could be measured variously in total length, body mass, or wingspan. Different lifestyle needs among various eagles result in variable measurements from species to species. For example, many forest-dwelling eagles, including the very large harpy eagle, have relatively short wingspans, a feature necessary for being able to maneuver in quick, short bursts through densely forested habitats. Eagles in the genus \"Aquila\", found almost exclusively in open country, are noted for their ability to soar, and have relatively long wings for their size.\nThese lists of the top five eagles are based on weight, length, and wingspan, respectively. Unless otherwise noted by reference, the figures listed are the median reported for each measurement in the guide \"Raptors of the World\" in which only measurements that could be personally verified by the authors were listed.\nHabitat.\nThe eagles are generally distributed in all types of habitats and nearly all parts of the world. The birds can be found in northern tundra to tropical rainforests and deserts. In North America, bald eagles and golden eagles are very common.\nGroups.\nEagles are often informally divided into four groups.\nThe snake eagles are placed in the subfamily Circaetinae. The fish eagles, booted eagles, and harpy eagles have traditionally been placed in the subfamily Buteoninae together with the buzzard-hawks (buteonine hawks) and harriers. Some authors may treat these groups as tribes of the Buteoninae; Lerner &amp; Mindell proposed separating the eagle groups into their own subfamilies of Accipitridae.\nFish eagles.\nFish eagles (or sea eagles) take fish as a large part of their diets, either fresh or as carrion.\nSome authors include \"Gypohierax angolensis\", the \"vulturine fish eagle\" (also called the palm-nut vulture) in this group. However, genetic analyses indicate it is related to a grouping of \"Neophron\"\u2013\"Gypaetus\"\u2013\"Eutriorchis\" (Egyptian vulture, bearded vulture (lammergeier), and Madagascar serpent eagle).\nThe fish eagles have a close genetic relationship with \"Haliastur\" and \"Milvus\"; the whole group is only distantly related to the \"Buteo\" group.\nFish eagles exist in every continent throughout the world, except for South America.\nAlthough fish eagles can be found in many different places around the world, they have been classified as \"Near Threatened\". Reasons such as overfishing, pollution, habitat destruction, and the use of pesticides have contributed to the species' rapid population drop.\nBooted eagles.\nBooted eagles or \"true eagles\" have feathered tarsi (lower legs).\nTribe Aquililae or proposed subfamily Aquilinae. Genera: \"Aquila\", \"Hieraaetus\"; \"Spizaetus\", \"Oroaetus\", \"Spizastur\"; \"Nisaetus\"; \"Ictinaetus\", \"Lophoaetus\"; \"Polemaetus\"; and \"Stephanoaetus\".\nSee comments under eagle species for changes to the composition of these genera.\nSnake eagles.\nMost snake or serpent eagles, as the name suggests, primarily prey on snakes.\nDespite filling the niche of a snake eagle, genetic studies suggest that the Madagascar serpent eagle (\"Eutriorchis\") is not related to them.\nOver several decades, a great deal of research has been done on the \u00a0Snake-eagle's diet, which is mainly made up of reptiles, especially snakes. When it comes to catching snakes, it is generally accepted that the bird exhibits generalist feeding behavior, which means it does not hunt down specific types of snakes but rather feeds on them depending on their availability in the wild.\nHarpy eagles.\nHarpy eagles or \"giant forest eagles\" are large eagles that inhabit tropical forests. The group contains two to six species, depending on the author. Although these birds occupy similar niches and have traditionally been grouped, they are not all related: the solitary eagles are related to the black hawks and the Philippine eagle to the snake eagles.\nSpecies.\nMajor new research into eagle taxonomy suggests that the important genera \"Aquila\" and \"Hieraaetus\" are not composed of nearest relatives, and it is likely that a reclassification of these genera will soon take place, with some species being moved to \"Lophaetus\" or \"Ictinaetus\".\nFamily Accipitridae\nIn culture.\nEtymology.\nThe modern English term for the bird is derived from by way of . The origin of is unknown, but it is believed to possibly derive from (meaning dark-colored, swarthy, or blackish) as a reference to the plumage of eagles.\nOld English used the term , related to Scandinavia's \"\u00f8rn/\u00f6rn\". It is similar to other Indo-European terms for \"bird\" or \"eagle\", including (), (), and .\nIn the southern part of Finland, near the Gulf of Finland, is the town of Kotka, which literally means \"eagle\", while the town of L'Aquila in the central part of Italy literally means \"the eagle\".\nIn Britain before 1678, \"eagle\" referred specifically to the golden eagle, with the other native species, the white-tailed eagle, being known as \"erne\". The modern name \"golden eagle\" for \"aquila chrysaetos\" was introduced by the naturalist John Ray.\nThe village of Eagle in Lincolnshire, England, has nothing to do with the bird; its name is derived from the Old English words for \"oak\" and \"wood\" (compare \"Oakley\").\nReligion and spirituality.\nIn the ancient Sumerian mythology, the mythical king Etana was said to have been carried into heaven by an eagle. Classical writers such as Lucan and Pliny the Elder claimed that the eagle was able to look directly at the sun, and that they forced their fledglings to do the same. Those that blinked would be cast from the nest. This belief persisted until the Medieval era.\nThe eagle is the patron animal of the ancient Greek god Zeus. In particular, Zeus was said to have taken the form of an eagle in order to abduct Ganymede, and there are numerous artistic depictions of the eagle Zeus bearing Ganymede aloft, from Classical times up to the present (see illustrations in the Ganymede (mythology) page.)\nEagles appear metaphorically in many translations of the Old Testament. God is spoken of as carrying Israel on \"eagles' wings\" in Exodus 19:4, Isaiah 40:31 compares those who wait on the Lord to flying eagles, and Psalm 103 mentions renewing one's youth \"as the eagle\". In explaining this rejuvenation, Augustine of Hippo says in his commentary on the Psalms that eagles' beaks overgrow as they age and that they break them against rocks to restore them. The translation, however, is uncertain: the word in the Hebrew, \u05e0\u05e9\u05e8, can also be translated vulture, and is listed alongside specific kinds of vulture in Leviticus' discussion of unclean animals.\nThe eagle is also often used in Christian iconography to represent the Gospel of John, and eagle-shaped lecterns are common in Anglican and some Roman Catholic churches. The eagle was believed to be able to look directly into the sun in the same way that the Gospel of John looks directly at Jesus' divinity, and the great distances the eagle flies represent the spread of the gospel to the ends of the earth.\nThe United States eagle feather law stipulates that only individuals of certifiable Native American ancestry enrolled in a federally recognized tribe are legally authorized to obtain eagle feathers for religious or spiritual reasons. In Canada, the poaching of eagle feathers for the booming U.S. market has sometimes resulted in the arrests of First Nations person for the crime.\nThe Moche people of ancient Peru worshiped the eagle and often depicted eagles in their art. The golden eagle was sacred to the Aztec god Huitzilopochtli while the harpy eagle was sacred to Quetzalcoatl.\nHeraldry.\nEagles are an exceptionally common symbol in heraldry, being considered the \"King of Birds\" in contrast to the lion, the \"King of Beasts\". Whereas the lion (e.g. England) usually represents authority, the eagle is the symbol of power. They are particularly popular in Germanic countries such as Austria, due to their association with the Holy Roman Empire. The eagle of the Holy Roman Empire was two-headed, supposedly representing the two divisions, East and West, of the old Roman Empire. This motif, derived from the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire was also adopted by the Russian Empire and is still featured in the Flag of Albania. The Roman eagle was preceded by the eagle of Ptolemaic Egypt and the Achaemenid Empire. In the coat of arms of Kotka, Finland, the eagle is depicted carrying an anchor and the caduceus on its feet.\nHeraldic eagles are most often found \"displayed\", i.e. with their wings and legs extended. They can also occur \"close\", i.e. with their wings folded, or \"rising\", i.e. about to take flight. The heads, wings, and legs of eagles can also be found independently.\nEagles symbolize strength, courage, and independence and are commonly found in the heraldry of many nations across the world. Albania, Andorra, Armenia, Austria, Dagestan, Egypt, Germany, Ghana, Indonesia, Iraq, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Montenegro, Nigeria, the Philippines, Poland, Palestine, Panama, Russia, Romania, Serbia, South Sudan, Somaliland, Syria, the United States of America, Yemen, Zambia, and Zimbabwe are the\u00a0nations whose coats of arms feature an eagle. The eagle's continuing significance and worldwide appeal as a forceful symbol in national identity and imagery is demonstrated by its widespread usage.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They comprised a major part of the Japanese writing system during the time of Old Japanese and are still used, along with the subsequently derived syllabic scripts of and . The characters have Japanese pronunciations; most have two, with one based on the Chinese sound. A few characters were invented in Japan by constructing character components derived from other Chinese characters. After the Meiji Restoration, Japan made its own efforts to simplify the characters, now known as , by a process similar to China's simplification efforts, with the intention to increase literacy among the general public. Since the 1920s, the Japanese government has published character lists periodically to help direct the education of its citizenry through the myriad Chinese characters that exist. There are nearly 3,000 kanji used in Japanese names and in common communication.\nThe term in Japanese literally means \"Han characters\". Japanese kanji and Chinese () share a common foundation. The significant use of Chinese characters in Japan first began to take hold around the 5th century AD and has since had a profound influence in shaping Japanese culture, language, literature, history, and records. Inkstone artifacts at archaeological sites dating back to the earlier Yayoi period were also found to contain Chinese characters.\nAlthough some characters, as used in Japanese and Chinese, have similar meanings and pronunciations, others have meanings or pronunciations that are unique to one language or the other. For example, \u8aa0 means 'honest' in both languages but is pronounced or in Japanese, and in Standard Mandarin Chinese. Individual kanji characters and multi-kanji words invented in Japan from Chinese morphemes have been borrowed into Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese in recent times. These are known as Wasei-kango, or Japanese-made Chinese words. For example, the word for telephone, \u96fb\u8a71 in Japanese, was derived from the Chinese words for \"electric\" and \"conversation.\" It was then calqued as in Mandarin Chinese, in Vietnamese and in Korean.\nHistory.\nChinese characters first came to Japan on official seals, letters, swords, coins, mirrors, and other decorative items imported from China. The earliest known instance of such an import was the King of Na gold seal given by Emperor Guangwu of Han to a Wa emissary in 57 AD. Chinese coins as well as inkstones from the first century AD have also been found in Yayoi period archaeological sites. However, the Japanese people of that era probably had little to no comprehension of the script, and they would remain relatively illiterate until the fifth century AD, when writing in Japan became more widespread. According to the and , a semi-legendary scholar called Wani was dispatched to Japan by the Kingdom of Baekje during the reign of Emperor \u014cjin in the early fifth century, bringing with him knowledge of Confucianism and Chinese characters. \nThe earliest Japanese documents were probably written by bilingual Chinese or Korean officials employed at the Yamato court. For example, the diplomatic correspondence from King Bu of Wa to Emperor Shun of Liu Song in 478 AD has been praised for its skillful use of allusion. Later, groups of people called were organized under the monarch to read and write Classical Chinese. During the reign of Empress Suiko (593\u2013628), the Yamato court began sending full-scale diplomatic missions to China, which resulted in a large increase in Chinese literacy at the Japanese court. \nIn ancient times, paper was so rare that people wrote kanji onto thin, rectangular strips of wood, called (\u6728\u7c21). These wooden boards were used for communication between government offices, tags for goods transported between various countries, and the practice of writing. The oldest written kanji in Japan discovered so far were written in ink on wood as a wooden strip dated to the 7th century, a record of trading for cloth and salt.\nThe Japanese language had no written form at the time Chinese characters were introduced, and texts were written and read only in Chinese. Later, during the Heian period (794\u20131185), a system known as emerged, which involved using Chinese text with diacritical marks to allow Japanese speakers to read Chinese sentences and restructure them into Japanese on the fly, by changing word order and adding particles and verb endings, in accordance with the rules of Japanese grammar. This was essentially a kind of codified sight translation.\nChinese characters also came to be used to write texts in the vernacular Japanese language, resulting in the modern syllabaries. Around 650 AD, a writing system called (used in the ancient poetry anthology ) evolved that used a number of Chinese characters for their sound, rather than for their meaning. written in cursive style evolved into (literally \"fluttering \" in reference to the motion of the brush during cursive writing), or , that is, \"ladies' hand\", a writing system that was accessible to women (who were denied higher education). Major works of Heian-era literature by women were written in . (literally \"partial \", in reference to the practice of using a part of a kanji character) emerged via a parallel path: monastery students simplified to a single constituent element. Thus the two other writing systems, and , referred to collectively as , are descended from kanji. In contrast with (\u4eee\u540d, literally \"borrowed name\", in reference to the character being \"borrowed\" as a label for its sound), kanji are also called (\u771f\u540d, literally \"true name\", in reference to the character being used as a label for its meaning).\nIn modern Japanese, kanji are used to write certain words or parts of words (usually content words such as nouns, adjective stems, and verb stems), while are used to write inflected verb and adjective endings, phonetic complements to disambiguate readings (), particles, and miscellaneous words which have no kanji or whose kanji are considered obscure or too difficult to read or remember. are mostly used for representing onomatopoeia, non-Japanese loanwords (except those borrowed from ancient Chinese), the names of plants and animals (with exceptions), and for emphasis on certain words.\nOrthographic reform and lists of kanji.\nSince ancient times, there has been a strong opinion in Japan that kanji is the orthodox form of writing, but others have argued against it. Kamo no Mabuchi, a scholar of the Edo period, criticized the large number of characters in kanji. He also appreciated the small number of characters in characters and argued for the limitation of kanji.\nAfter the Meiji Restoration and as Japan entered an era of active exchange with foreign countries, the need for script reform in Japan began to be called for. Some scholars argued for the abolition of kanji and the writing of Japanese using only or Latin characters. These views were not widespread.\nHowever, the need to limit the number of kanji characters was understood, and in May 1923, the Japanese government announced 1,962 kanji characters for regular use. In 1940, the Japanese Army decided on the which limited the number of kanji that could be used for weapons names to 1,235. In 1942, the National Language Council announced the with a total of 2,528 characters, showing the standard for kanji used by ministries and agencies and in general society.\nIn 1946, after World War II and under the Allied occupation of Japan, the Japanese government, guided by the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, instituted a series of orthographic reforms, to help children learn and to simplify kanji use in literature and periodicals.\nThe number of characters in circulation was reduced, and formal lists of characters to be learned during each grade of school were established.\nSome characters were given simplified glyphs, called . Many variant forms of characters and obscure alternatives for common characters were officially discouraged.\nThese are simply guidelines, so many characters outside these standards are still widely known and commonly used; these are known as .\nkanji.\nThe are the 1,026 first kanji characters that Japanese children learn in elementary school, from first grade to sixth grade. The grade-level breakdown is known as the , or the . This list of kanji is maintained by the Japanese Ministry of Education and prescribes which kanji characters and which kanji readings students should learn for each grade.\nkanji.\nThe are 2,136 characters consisting of all the kanji, plus 1,110 additional kanji taught in junior high and high school. In publishing, characters outside this category are often given . The kanji were introduced in 1981, replacing an older list of 1,850 characters known as the , introduced in 1946. Originally numbering 1,945 characters, the kanji list was expanded to 2,136 in 2010. Some of the new characters were previously kanji; some are used to write prefecture names: , , , , , , , , , and .\nkanji.\nAs of September 25, 2017, the consists of 863 characters. Kanji on this list are mostly used in people's names and some are traditional variants of kanji. There were only 92 kanji in the original list published in 1952, but new additions have been made frequently. Sometimes the term kanji refers to all 2,999 kanji from both the and lists combined.\nkanji.\n are any kanji not contained in the kanji and kanji lists. These are generally written using traditional characters, but extended forms exist.\nJapanese Industrial Standards for kanji.\nThe Japanese Industrial Standards for kanji and define character code-points for each kanji and , as well as other forms of writing such as the Latin alphabet, Cyrillic script, Greek alphabet, Arabic numerals, etc. for use in information processing. They have had numerous revisions. The current standards are:\nGaiji.\n are kanji that are not represented in existing Japanese encoding systems. These include variant forms of common kanji that need to be represented alongside the more conventional glyph in reference works and can include non-kanji symbols as well.\n can be either user-defined characters, system-specific characters or third-party add-on products. Both are a problem for information interchange, as the code point used to represent an external character will not be consistent from one computer or operating system to another.\n were nominally prohibited in JIS X 0208-1997 where the available number of code-points was reduced to only 940. JIS X 0213-2000 used the entire range of code-points previously allocated to , making them completely unusable. Most desktop and mobile systems have moved to Unicode negating the need for for most users. Historically, were used by Japanese mobile service providers for emoji.\nUnicode allows for optional encoding of in private use areas, while Adobe's SING (Smart INdependent Glyphlets) technology allows the creation of customized gaiji.\nThe Text Encoding Initiative uses a \u27e8g\u27e9 element to encode any non-standard character or glyph, including gaiji. The \"g\" stands for .\nTotal number of kanji.\nThere is no definitive count of kanji characters, just as there is none of Chinese characters generally. The , which is considered to be comprehensive in Japan, contains about 50,000 characters. The , published in 1994 in China, contains about 85,000 characters, but the majority of them are not in common use in any country, and many are obscure variants or archaic forms.\nA list of 2,136 kanji is regarded as necessary for functional literacy in Japanese. Approximately a thousand more characters are commonly used and readily understood by the majority in Japan and a few thousand more find occasional use, particularly in specialized fields of study but those may be obscure to most out of context. A total of 13,108 characters can be encoded in various Japanese Industrial Standards for kanji.\nReadings.\nIndividual kanji may be used to write one or more different words or morphemes, leading to different pronunciations or \"readings.\" The correct reading may be determined by contextual cues (such as whether the character represents part of a compound word versus an independent word), the exact intended meaning of the word, and its position within the sentence. For example, is mostly read , meaning \"today\", but in formal writing it is read , meaning \"nowadays\". is used to specify ambiguous readings, such as rare, literary, or otherwise non-standard readings.\nReadings are categorized as either , native Japanese, or , borrowed from Chinese. Most kanji have at least a single reading of each category, though some have only one, such as or ; Japanese-coined kanji () often only have readings.\nSome common kanji have ten or more possible readings; the most complex common example is , which is read as , , , , , , , , , , , and , totaling eight basic readings (the first two are , while the rest are ), or 12 if related verbs are counted as distinct.\n(Sino-Japanese reading).\nThe , the Sino-Japanese reading, is the modern descendant of the Japanese approximation of the base Chinese pronunciation of the character at the time it was introduced. It was often previously referred to as translation reading, as it was recreated readings of the Chinese pronunciation but was not the Chinese pronunciation or reading itself, similar to the English pronunciation of Latin loanwords. There also exist kanji created by the Japanese and given an reading despite not being a Chinese-derived or a Chinese-originating character. Some kanji were introduced from different parts of China at different times, and so have multiple , and often multiple meanings. Kanji invented in Japan () would not normally be expected to have , but there are exceptions, such as the character \"to work\", which has the \" and the \", and \"gland\", which has only the \"\"\u2014in both cases these come from the of the phonetic component, respectively \"\" and \"\".\n(native reading).\nThe , the native reading, is a reading based on the pronunciation of a native Japanese word, or , that closely approximated the meaning of the Chinese character when it was introduced. As with , there can be multiple for the same kanji, and some kanji have no at all.\n are characters used only for their sounds. In this case, pronunciation is still based on a standard reading, or used only for meaning (broadly a form of , narrowly ). Therefore, only the full compound\u2014not the individual character\u2014has a reading. There are also special cases where the reading is completely different, often based on a historical or traditional reading.\nThe analogous phenomenon occurs to a much lesser degree in Chinese varieties, where there are literary and colloquial readings of Chinese characters\u2014borrowed readings and native readings. In Chinese these borrowed readings and native readings are etymologically related, since they are between Chinese varieties (which are related), not from Chinese to Japanese (which are not related). They thus form doublets and are generally similar, analogous to different , reflecting different stages of Chinese borrowings into Japanese.\nGairaigo.\nLonger readings exist for non- characters and non-kanji symbols, where a long gairaigo word may be the reading (this is classed as \u2014see single character gairaigo, below)\u2014the character has the seven reading \"centimeter\", though it is generally written as \"cm\" (with two half-width characters, so occupying one space); another common example is '%' (the percent sign), which has the five kana reading .\nMixed readings.\nThere are many kanji compounds that use a mixture of and ; these may be considered hybrid words. Readings in which the first kanji is \"on'yomi\" and the second is \"kun'yomi\" are classified as , while \"kun-on\" words are classified as . The words \"j\u016bbako\" and \"yut\u014d\" are themselves examples of the reading patterns they represent (they are autological words). Other examples include , and .\n often use mixed readings. For instance, the city of Sapporo (), whose name derives from the Ainu language and has no meaning in Japanese, is written with the compound (which includes as if it were a purely compound).\nSpecial readings.\n and are readings of kanji combinations that have no direct correspondence to the characters' individual or . From the point of view of the character, rather than the word, this is known as a , and these are listed in kanji dictionaries under the entry for the character.\n are other readings assigned to a character instead of its standard readings. An example is reading (meaning \"cold\") as (\"winter\") rather than the standard readings or , and instead of the usual spelling for of . Another example is using (lit.\u2009'smoke grass') with the reading (\"tobacco\") rather than the otherwise-expected readings of or . Some of these, such as for , have become lexicalized, but in many cases this kind of use is typically non-standard and employed in specific contexts by individual writers. Aided with , could be used to convey complex literary or poetic effect (especially if the readings contradict the kanji), or clarification if the referent may not be obvious.\n are when the standard kanji for a word are related to the meaning, but not the sound. The word is pronounced as a whole, not corresponding to sounds of individual kanji. For example, (\"this morning\") is . This word is not read as , the expected of the characters, and only infrequently as , the of the characters. The most common reading is , a native bisyllabic Japanese word that may be seen as a single morpheme, or as a compound of (\u201cthis\u201d, as in , the older reading for , \u201ctoday\u201d), and , \u201cmorning\u201d. Likewise, (\"today\") is also , usually read with the native reading ; its , , does occur in certain words and expressions, especially in the broader sense \"nowadays\" or \"current\", such as (\"present-day\"), although in the phrase (\"good day\"), is typically spelled wholly with rather than with the kanji .\n are primarily used for some native Japanese words, such as Yamato or , the name of the dominant ethnic group of Japan, a former Japanese province as well as ancient name for Japan), and for some old borrowings, such as (, literally \"willow leaf fish\") from Ainu, (, literally \u201csmoke grass\u201d) from Portuguese, or (, literally \u201cwheat alcohol\u201d) from Dutch, especially if the word was borrowed before the Meiji period. Words whose kanji are are often usually written as (if native), or (if borrowed); some old borrowed words are also written as , especially Portuguese loanwords such as () from Portuguese \"\" (English \"card\") or () from Portuguese \"\" (English \u201ctimes, season\u201d), as well as ().\nA case where \"jukujikun\" is used for Sino-Japanese is the word \"ky\u014ddai\", which, prototypically, means \"brothers\" and is spelt (\"big and little brothers\"). However, the meaning has been expanded to \"siblings\" in general, and can assume such spellings as (\"(big and little) sisters\", alternatively pronounced \"shimai\"), (\"big brother and little sister\") and (\"big sister and little brother\"). It is also possible to say \"otoko ky\u014ddai\" (\"male siblings; brothers\") and \"onna ky\u014ddai\" (\"female siblings; sisters\").\nSometimes, can even have more kanji than there are syllables, examples being (, \u201cwoodpecker\u201d), (, \u201csilver berry, oleaster\u201d), and (, a surname). This phenomenon is observed in animal names that are shortened and used as suffixes for zoological compound names, for example when , normally read as , is shortened to in , although zoological names are commonly spelled with katakana rather than with kanji. Outside zoology, this type of shortening only occurs on a handful of words, for example , or the historical male name suffix , which was shortened from the word .\nThe kanji compound for is often idiosyncratic and created for the word, and there is no corresponding Chinese word with that spelling. In other cases, a kanji compound for an existing Chinese word is reused, where the Chinese word and may or may not be used in Japanese. For example, (\"reindeer\") is for , from Ainu, but the reading of is also used. In some cases, Japanese coinages have subsequently been borrowed back into Chinese, such as (, \"monkfish\").\nThe underlying word for is a native Japanese word or foreign borrowing, which either does not have an existing kanji spelling (either or ) or for which a new kanji spelling is produced. Most often the word is a noun, which may be a simple noun (not a compound or derived from a verb), or may be a verb form or a fusional pronunciation. For example, the word (, \"sumo\") is originally from the verb (, \u201cto vie, to compete\u201d), while (, \"today\") is fusional (from older , \"this\" + , \"day\").\nIn rare cases, is also applied to inflectional words (verbs and adjectives), in which case there is frequently a corresponding Chinese word. The most common example of an inflectional is the adjective (, \u201ccute\u201d), originally ; the word is used in Chinese, but the corresponding is not used in Japanese. By contrast, \"appropriate\" can be either (, as ) or (, as ). Which reading to use can be discerned by the presence or absence of the ending (). A common example of a verb with is (, \u201cto spread, to be in vogue\u201d), corresponding to (). A sample deverbal (noun derived from a verb form) is (, \"extortion\"), from (, \u201cto extort\u201d), spelling from (, \"extortion\"). Note that there are also compound verbs and, less commonly, compound adjectives, and while these may have multiple kanji without intervening characters, they are read using the usual . Examples include (, \"interesting\", literally \"face + white\") and (, \"sly\", lit. \"cunning, crafty + clever, smart\").\nTypographically, the for are often written so they are centered across the entire word, or for inflectional words over the entire root\u2014corresponding to the reading being related to the entire word\u2014rather than each part of the word being centered over its corresponding character, as is often done for the usual phono-semantic readings.\nSingle character gairaigo.\nIn some rare cases, kanji may have a reading borrowed from a modern foreign language (\"gairaigo\"), though usually \"gairaigo\" are written in . Notable examples include , , , and . These are classed as , because the character is used for its meaning\u2014the \"kun'yomi\" label may sometimes be misleading, since most \"kun'yomi\" are native Japanese readings. The readings are also rendered in , unlike the usual for native . Note that most of these characters are for units, particularly SI units, in many cases using new characters () coined during the Meiji period, such as .\nSome kanji also have lesser-known readings called , which are mostly used for names (often given names) and, in general, are closely related to the . Place names sometimes also use or, occasionally, unique readings not found elsewhere.\nWhen to use which reading.\nAlthough there are general rules for when to use and when to use , many kanji have multiple on- or kun-readings, and the language is littered with exceptions; how a character was meant to be read is sometimes ambiguous even to native speakers (this is especially true for names, both of people and places). \nA single kanji followed by ( forming part of a word)\u2014such as the inflectable suffixes forming native verbs and adjectives like \u8d64\u3044 (\"akai\"; red) and \u898b\u308b (\"miru\"; to see)\u2014\"always\" indicates . can indicate which to use, as in () versus (), both meaning \"(to) eat\", but this is not always sufficient, as in , which may be read as or , both meaning \"(to) open\".\nKanji compounds (), especially yojijukugo, usually, but not always, use , usually (but not always) . In , \u89e3 is read with its \"kan-on\" reading instead of its more common \"go-on\" reading, . Exceptions are common\u2014 (; information), for example, is \"go-kan\". (; beef) and (; mutton) have readings, but (; pork) and (; poultry) have readings. Examples of fully \"kun'yomi\" compounds include (; letter), (; parasol), and the infamous (; divine wind). Some \"kun'yomi\" compounds have non-inflective , such as (; Chinese-style fried chicken) and (); many can also be written with the omitted. \nKanji in isolation are typically read using their ; exceptions include the \"on'yomi\" (; love), (), and (; mark, dot). Most of these \"on'yomi\" cases involve kanji that have no . For kanji with multiple common isolated readings, such as , which may be read as (gold) or (money, metal), only context can determine the intended reading. \nThe isolated kanji versus compound distinction gives words for similar concepts completely different pronunciations. Alone, (north) and (east) use the and , but (northeast), uses the . Inconsistencies also occur between compounds; is read as in (; teacher) but as in (; one's whole life) (both \"on'yomi\"). \nMultiple readings have given rise to a number of homographs, in some cases having different meanings depending on how they are read. One example is , which can be read in three different ways: (skilled), (upper part), or (stage left/house right). In addition, has the reading (skilled). More subtly, has three different readings, all meaning \"tomorrow\": (casual), (polite), and (formal).\nConversely, some terms are homophonous but not homographic, and thus ambiguous in speech but not in writing. To remedy this, alternate readings may be used for confusable words. For example, (privately established, esp. school) and (municipal) are both normally pronounced ; in speech these may be distinguished by the alternative pronunciations and . More informally, in legal jargon (preamble) and (full text) are both pronounced , so may be pronounced for clarity, as in \"Have you memorized the preamble [not 'whole text'] of the constitution?\". As in these examples, this is primarily done using a for one character in a normally term.\nLegalese.\nCertain words take different readings depending on whether the context concerns legal matters or not. For example:\nAmbiguous readings.\nIn some instances where even context cannot easily provide clarity for homophones, alternative readings or mixed readings can be used instead of regular readings to avoid ambiguity. For example:\nThere are also cases where the words are technically heterophones, but they have similar meanings and pronunciations, therefore liable to mishearing and misunderstanding.\nPlace names.\nSeveral famous place names, including those of Japan itself ( or sometimes ), those of some cities such as Tokyo ( ) and Kyoto ( ), and those of the main islands Honshu ( ), Kyushu ( ), Shikoku ( ), and Hokkaido ( ) are read with ; however, the majority of Japanese place names are read with : , , . Names often use characters and readings that are not in common use outside of names. When characters are used as abbreviations of place names, their reading may not match that in the original. The Osaka () and Kobe () baseball team, the Hanshin () Tigers, take their name from the of the second kanji of and the first of . The name of the Keisei () railway line\u2014linking Tokyo () and Narita ()\u2014is formed similarly, although the reading of from is , despite already being an in the word .\nJapanese family names are also usually read with : , , . Japanese given names often have very irregular readings. Although they are not typically considered or , they often contain mixtures of , and , such as [], []. Being chosen at the discretion of the parents, the readings of given names do not follow any set rules, and it is impossible to know with certainty how to read a person's name without independent verification. Parents can be quite creative, and rumors abound of children called (\"Earth\") and (\"Angel\"); neither are common names, and have normal readings and respectively. Some common Japanese names can be written in multiple ways, e.g., Akira can be written as , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and many other characters and kanji combinations not listed, Satoshi can be written as , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , etc., and Haruka can be written as , , , , , , , , and several other possibilities. Common patterns do exist, however, allowing experienced readers to make a good guess for most names. To alleviate any confusion on how to pronounce the names of other Japanese people, most official Japanese documents require Japanese to write their names in both and kanji.\nChinese place names and Chinese personal names appearing in Japanese texts, if spelled in kanji, are almost invariably read with . Especially for older and well-known names, the resulting Japanese pronunciation may differ widely from that used by modern Chinese speakers. For example, Mao Zedong's name is pronounced as in Japanese, and the name of the legendary Monkey King, Sun Wukong, is pronounced () in Japanese.\nToday, Chinese names that are not well known in Japan are often spelled in instead, in a form much more closely approximating the native Chinese pronunciation. Alternatively, they may be written in kanji with . Many such cities have names that come from non-Chinese languages like Mongolian or Manchu. Examples of such not-well-known Chinese names include:\nInternationally renowned Chinese-named cities tend to imitate the older English pronunciations of their names, regardless of the kanji's or the Mandarin or Cantonese pronunciation, and can be written in either or kanji. Examples include:\nNotes: \nIn some cases the same kanji can appear in a given word with different readings. Normally this occurs when a character is duplicated and the reading of the second character has voicing (), as in \"people\" (more often written with the iteration mark as ), but in rare cases the readings can be unrelated, as in .\nPronunciation assistance.\nBecause of the ambiguities involved, kanji sometimes have their pronunciation for the given context spelled out in ruby characters known as , (small written above or to the right of the character, e.g. &lt;ruby lang=\"ja\"&gt;\u632f\u4eee\u540d&lt;rp&gt;\uff08&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;rt&gt;\u3075\u308a\u304c\u306a&lt;/rt&gt;&lt;rp&gt;\uff09&lt;/rp&gt;&lt;/ruby&gt;) or (small written in-line after the character). This is especially true in texts for children or foreign learners. It is also used in newspapers and for rare or unusual readings, or for situations like the first time a character's name is given, and for characters not included in the officially recognized set of essential kanji. Works of fiction sometimes use to create new \"words\" by giving normal kanji non-standard readings, or to attach a foreign word rendered in as the reading for a kanji or kanji compound of the same or similar meaning.\nSpelling words.\nConversely, specifying a given kanji, or spelling out a kanji word\u2014whether the pronunciation is known or not\u2014can be complicated, due to the fact that there is not a commonly used standard way to refer to individual kanji (one does not refer to \"kanji #237\"), and that a given reading does not map to a single kanji\u2014indeed there are many homophonous \"words\", not simply individual characters, particularly for (with ). It is easiest to write the word out\u2014either on paper or tracing it in the air\u2014or look it up (given the pronunciation) in a dictionary, particularly an electronic dictionary; when this is not possible, such as when speaking over the phone or writing implements are not available (and tracing in air is too complicated), various techniques can be used. These include giving for characters\u2014these are often unique\u2014using a well-known word with the same character (and preferably the same pronunciation and meaning), and describing the character via its components. For example, one may explain how to spell the word via the words , , and \u2014the first two use the , the third is a well-known compound\u2014saying \", , as in .\"\nDictionaries.\nIn dictionaries, both words and individual characters have readings glossed, via various conventions. Native words and Sino-Japanese vocabulary are glossed in (for both and readings), while borrowings ()\u2014including modern borrowings from Chinese\u2014are glossed in ; this is the standard writing convention also used in . By contrast, readings for individual characters are conventionally written in for \"on\" readings, and for \"kun\" readings. Kun readings may further have a separator to indicate which characters are , and which are considered readings of the character itself. For example, in the entry for , the reading corresponding to the basic verb may be written as (\"ta.beru\"), to indicate that \"ta\" is the reading of the character itself. Further, kanji dictionaries often list compounds including irregular readings of a kanji.\nLocal developments and divergences from Chinese.\nSince kanji are essentially Chinese \"hanzi\" used to write Japanese, the majority of characters used in modern Japanese still retain their Chinese meaning, physical resemblance with some of their modern traditional Chinese characters counterparts, and a degree of similarity with Classical Chinese pronunciation imported to Japan from the 5th to 9th centuries. Nevertheless, after centuries of development, there is a notable number of kanji used in modern Japanese which have different meaning from \"hanzi\" used in modern Chinese. Such differences are the result of:\nLikewise, the process of character simplification in mainland China since the 1950s has resulted in the fact that Japanese speakers who have not studied Chinese may not recognize some simplified characters.\nIn addition to unique Japanese renditions of existing Chinese characters, there also exist kanji that were invented in Japan; these may be referred to as or . They are primarily formed by combining existing components in unique ways, as is typical for Chinese characters. The \"J\u014dy\u014d\" list contains about 9 \"kokuji\", of which the most commonly used is (\"d\u014d\"; work) used in the fundamental verb (\"hataraku\"; to work). It is formed from the 'person' radical \u4ebb plus \u52d5 (movement). Some \"kokuji\", including \u50cd, have entered the Chinese language.\nThe term \"kokuji\" may also refer to Chinese characters coined in other (non-Chinese) countries; the corresponding phenomenon in Korea is called (Korean:\u00a0; Hanja:\u00a0; national characters); there are however far fewer Korean-coined characters than Japanese-coined ones. Other languages using the Chinese family of scripts sometimes have far more extensive systems of native characters, most significantly Vietnamese , which comprises over 20,000 characters used throughout traditional Vietnamese writing, and Zhuang sawndip, which comprises over 10,000 characters, which are still in use.\nIn addition to , there are kanji that have been given meanings in Japanese that are different from their original Chinese meanings. These are not considered but are instead called () and include characters such as the following:\nTypes of kanji by category.\nHan-dynasty scholar Xu Shen, in his 2nd-century dictionary , classified Chinese characters into six categories ( , Japanese: ). The traditional classification is still taught but is problematic and is no longer the focus of modern lexicographic practice, as some categories are not clearly defined, nor are they mutually exclusive: the first four refer to structural composition, while the last two refer to usage.\n (Mandarin: ) characters are pictographic sketches of the object they represent. For example, is an eye, while is a tree. The current forms of the characters are very different from the originals, though their representations are more clear in oracle bone script and seal script. These pictographic characters make up only a small fraction of modern characters.\n (Mandarin: ) characters are ideographs, often called \"simple ideographs\" or \"simple indicatives\" to distinguish them and tell the difference from compound ideographs (below). They are usually simple graphically and represent an abstract concept such as \"up\" or \"above\" and \"down\" or \"below\". These make up a tiny fraction of modern characters.\n (Mandarin: ) characters are compound ideographs, often called \"compound indicatives\", \"associative compounds\", or just \"ideographs\". These are usually a combination of pictographs that combine semantically to present an overall meaning. An example of this type is (rest) from (person radical) and (tree). Another is the (mountain pass) made from (mountain), (up) and (down). These make up a tiny fraction of modern characters.\n (Mandarin: ) characters are phono-semantic or radical-phonetic compounds, sometimes called \"semantic-phonetic\", \"semasio-phonetic\", or \"phonetic-ideographic\" characters, are by far the largest category, making up about 90% of the characters in the standard lists; however, some of the most frequently used kanji belong to one of the three groups mentioned above, so will usually make up less than 90% of the characters in a text. Typically they are made up of two components, one of which (most commonly, but by no means always, the left or top element) suggests the general category of the meaning or semantic context, and the other (most commonly the right or bottom element) approximates the pronunciation. The pronunciation relates to the original Chinese, and may now only be distantly detectable in the modern Japanese of the kanji; it generally has no relation at all to . The same is true of the semantic context, which may have changed over the centuries or in the transition from Chinese to Japanese. As a result, it is a common error in folk etymology to fail to recognize a phono-semantic compound, typically instead inventing a compound-indicative explanation.\n (Mandarin: ) characters have variously been called \"derivative characters\", \"derivative cognates\", or translated as \"mutually explanatory\" or \"mutually synonymous\" characters; this is the most problematic of the six categories, as it is vaguely defined. It may refer to kanji where the meaning or application has become extended. For example, is used for 'music' and 'comfort, ease', with different pronunciations in Chinese reflected in the two different , \"music\" and \"pleasure\".\n (Mandarin: ) are rebuses, sometimes called \"phonetic loans\". The etymology of the characters follows one of the patterns above, but the present-day meaning is completely unrelated to this. A character was appropriated to represent a similar-sounding word. For example, in ancient Chinese was originally a pictograph for \"wheat\". Its syllable was homophonous with the verb meaning \"to come\", and the character is used for that verb as a result, without any embellishing \"meaning\" element attached. The character for wheat , originally meant \"to come\", being a having 'foot' at the bottom for its meaning part and \"wheat\" at the top for sound. The two characters swapped meaning, so today the more common word has the simpler character. This borrowing of sounds has a very long history.\nRelated symbols.\nThe iteration mark () is used to indicate that the preceding kanji is to be repeated, functioning similarly to a ditto mark in English. It is pronounced as though the kanji were written twice in a row, for example and . This mark also appears in personal and place names, as in the surname Sasaki (). This symbol is a simplified version of the kanji , a variant of .\nAnother abbreviated symbol is , in appearance a small , but actually a simplified version of the kanji , a general counter. It is pronounced when used to indicate quantity (such as , \"six months\") or if used as a genitive (as in \"Sekigahara\").\nThe way how these symbols may be produced on a computer depends on the operating system. In macOS, typing will reveal the symbol as well as , and . To produce , type . Under Windows, typing will reveal some of these symbols, while in Google IME, may be used.\nCollation.\nKanji, whose thousands of symbols defy ordering by conventions such as those used for the Latin script, are often collated using the traditional Chinese radical-and-stroke sorting method. In this system, common components of characters are identified; these are called radicals. Characters are grouped by their primary radical, then ordered by number of pen strokes within radicals. For example, the kanji character , meaning \"cherry\", is sorted as a ten-stroke character under the four-stroke primary radical meaning \"tree\". When there is no obvious radical or more than one radical, convention governs which is used for collation.\nOther kanji sorting methods, such as the SKIP system, have been devised by various authors.\nModern general-purpose Japanese dictionaries (as opposed to specifically character dictionaries) generally collate all entries, including words written using kanji, according to their representations (reflecting the way they are pronounced). The ordering of is normally used for this purpose.\nKanji education.\nJapanese schoolchildren are expected to learn 1,026 basic kanji, the kanji, before finishing the sixth grade. The order in which these characters are learned is fixed. The kanji list is a subset of a larger list, originally of 1,945 kanji and extended to 2,136 in 2010, known as the kanji required for the level of fluency necessary to read newspapers and literature in Japanese. This larger list of characters is to be mastered by the end of the ninth grade. Schoolchildren learn the characters by repetition and radical.\nStudents studying Japanese as a foreign language are often required by a curriculum to acquire kanji without having first learned the vocabulary associated with them. Strategies for these learners vary from copying-based methods to mnemonic-based methods such as those used in James Heisig's series \"Remembering the Kanji\". Other textbooks use methods based on the etymology of the characters, such as Mathias and Habein's \"The Complete Guide to Everyday Kanji\" and Henshall's \"A Guide to Remembering Japanese Characters\". Pictorial mnemonics, as in the text \"Kanji Pict-o-graphix\" by Michael Rowley, are also seen.\nThe Japan Kanji Aptitude Testing Foundation provides the ( ; \"Test of Japanese Kanji Aptitude\"), which tests the ability to read and write kanji. The highest level of the tests about six thousand kanji.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "37605", "revid": "50937336", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37605", "title": "Norfolk", "text": "County of England\nNorfolk ( ) is a ceremonial county in England, located in East Anglia and officially part of the East of England region. It borders Lincolnshire and The Wash to the north-west, the North Sea to the north and east, Cambridgeshire to the west, and Suffolk to the south. The largest settlement is the city of Norwich.\nThe county has an area of and had an estimated population of 940,359 in 2024. It is predominantly rural; Norwich is located in the centre-east, and the county's other principal settlements incude Great Yarmouth on the east coast, Thetford in the south, and King's Lynn in the north-west. For local government purposes Norfolk is a non-metropolitan county with seven districts.\nThe centre of Norfolk is gently undulating lowland. To the east are the Broads, a network of rivers and lakes which extend into Suffolk and which are protected by the Broads Authority, which give them a similar status to a national park. To the west the county contains part of the Fens, an extremely flat former marsh, and to the south is part of Thetford Forest. The geology of the county includes clay and chalk deposits, which make its coast susceptible to erosion; the northern coast has been designated a national landscape.\nThere is evidence of Prehistoric settlement in Norfolk. In the Roman era the region was home to the Iceni, whose leader Boudica led a major revolt in AD60. The Angles settled the area in the fifth century, and it became part of the Kingdom of East Anglia. During the later Middle Ages the county was very prosperous and heavily involved in the wool trade; this allowed the construction of many large churches. \nIn 1549 Norfolk was the scene of Kett's Rebellion, which unsuccessfully protested the enclosure of land. The county was not heavily industrialised during the Industrial Revolution, and Norwich lost its status as one of England's largest cities. The contemporary economy is largely based on agriculture and tourism.\nHistory.\nThe area that was to become Norfolk was settled in pre-Roman times (there were Palaeolithic settlers as early as 950,000 years ago), with camps along the higher land in the west, where flints could be quarried. A Brittonic tribe, the Iceni, emerged in the 1st century BC. The Iceni revolted against the Roman invasion in AD 47, and again in 60 led by Boudica. The crushing of the second rebellion opened the area to the Romans. During the Roman era roads and ports were constructed throughout the area and farming was widespread.\nSituated on the east coast, the homelands of the Iceni were vulnerable to attacks from continental Europe and other parts of Britain, and forts were built to defend against raids by the Saxons and the Picts. A period of depopulation, which may have been due to these threats, seems to have followed the departure of the Romans. Soon afterward, Germanic peoples from the North Sea area settled in the region. Though they became known as Angles, they were likely not affiliated to any tribe in particular at the time of their migration. It is thought that the settlement here was early (possibly beginning at the start of the fifth century, thereby preceding the alleged date of Hengist and Horsa's arrival in Kent) and that it occurred on a large scale.\nBy the 5th century, the Angles had established control over the region. They later became known as the \"north folk\" and the \"south folk,\" giving rise to the names \"Norfolk\" and \"Suffolk.\" Norfolk, Suffolk, and nearby territories formed the Kingdom of East Anglia, one of the Anglo-Saxon heptarchy, which was later incorporated into Mercia and subsequently into Wessex. The influence of the early English settlers is evident in numerous place names ending in \"-ham,\" \"-ingham,\" and \"-ton.\" Place-name endings such as \"-by\" and \"-thorpe\" are also common and indicate Danish origins; during the 9th century, the region was subject to Danish attacks, during which King Edmund the Martyr was killed. Additionally, several place names in the Fenland area contain Celtic elements, which some scholars interpret as evidence of a significant Brittonic population in the region.\nIn the centuries before the Norman Conquest the wetlands of the east of the county began to be converted to farmland, and settlements grew in these areas. Migration into East Anglia must have been high: by the time of the Domesday Book survey it was one of the most densely populated parts of the British Isles. During the high and late Middle Ages the county developed arable agriculture and woollen industries. Norfolk's prosperity at that time is evident from the county's large number of medieval churches: out of an original total of over one thousand some 659 have survived, more than in any other county in Britain and the greatest concentration in the world. The economy was in decline by the time of the Black Death, which dramatically reduced the population in 1349.\nKett's Rebellion occurred in Norfolk during the reign of Edward VI, largely in response to the enclosure of land by landlords, leaving peasants with nowhere to graze their animals, and to the general abuses of power by the nobility. It was led by Robert Kett, a yeoman farmer, who was joined by recruits from Norwich and the surrounding countryside. His group numbered some 16,000 by the time the rebels stormed Norwich on 29 July 1549 and took the city. Kett's rebellion ended on 27 August when the rebels were defeated by an army under the leadership of John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland at the Battle of Dussindale. Some 3,000 rebels were killed. Kett was captured, held in the Tower of London, tried for treason, and hanged from the walls of Norwich Castle.\nBy the late 16th century Norwich had grown to become the second-largest city in England, but over one-third of its population died in the plague epidemic of 1579, and in 1665 the Great Plague again killed around one-third of the population. During the English Civil War Norfolk was largely Parliamentarian. The economy and agriculture of the region declined somewhat. During the Industrial Revolution Norfolk developed little industry, except in Norwich, which was a late addition to the railway network.\nEarly military units included the Norfolk Militia. The local British Army regiments included the Royal Norfolk Regiment (now the Royal Anglian Regiment) and the Norfolk Yeomanry. In the 20th century the county developed a role in aviation. The first development in airfields came with the First World War; there was then a massive expansion during the Second World War with the growth of the Royal Air Force and the influx of the American USAAF 8th Air Force which operated from many Norfolk airfields.\nDuring the Second World War agriculture rapidly intensified, and it has remained very intensive since, with the establishment of large fields for growing cereals and oilseed rape.\nEconomy and industry.\nIn 1998 Norfolk had a Gross Domestic Product of \u00a39,319\u00a0million, which represents 1.5% of England's economy and 1.25% of the United Kingdom's economy. The GDP per head was \u00a311,825, compared to \u00a313,635 for East Anglia, \u00a312,845 for England and \u00a312,438 for the United Kingdom. In 1999\u20132000 the county had an unemployment rate of 5.6%, compared to 5.8% for England and 6.0% for the UK.\nData from 2017 provided a useful update on the county's economy. The median hourly gross pay was \u00a312.17 and the median weekly pay was \u00a3496.80; on a per year basis, the median gross income was \u00a325,458. The employment rate among persons aged 16 to 64 was 74.2% while the unemployment rate was 4.6%. The Norfolk economy was \"treading water with manufacturing sales and recruitment remaining static in the first quarter of the year\" according to research published in April 2018. A spokesperson for the\nNorfolk Chamber of Commerce made this comment: \"At a time when Norfolk firms face steep up-front costs, the apprenticeship system is in crisis, roads are being allowed to crumble, mobile phone and broadband 'not-spots' are multiplying, it's obvious that the key to improved productivity and competitiveness lies in getting the basics right\". The solution was seen as a need for the UK government to provide \"a far stronger domestic economic agenda ... to fix the fundamentals needed for business to thrive here...\"\nIn 2017, tourism was adding \u00a33.25\u00a0billion to the economy per year and supported some 65,000 jobs, being the fifth most important employment in Norfolk. The visitor economy had increased in value by more than \u00a3500\u00a0million since 2012.\nImportant business sectors also include energy (oil, gas and renewables), advanced engineering and manufacturing, and food and farming.\nMuch of Norfolk's fairly flat and fertile land has been drained for use as arable land. The principal arable crops are sugar beet, wheat, barley (for brewing) and oil seed rape. The county also boasts a saffron grower. Over 20% of employment in the county is in the agricultural and food industries.\nWell-known companies in Norfolk are Aviva (formerly Norwich Union), Colman's (part of Unilever), Lotus Cars and Bernard Matthews Farms. The Construction Industry Training Board is based on the former airfield of RAF Bircham Newton. Brewer Greene King, food producer Cranswick and feed supplier ForFarmers were seeing growth in 2016\u20132017.\nA local enterprise partnership was being established by business leaders to help grow jobs across Norfolk and Suffolk. They secured an enterprise zone to help grow businesses in the energy sector, and established the two counties as a centre for growing services and products for the green economy.\nTo help local industry in Norwich, the local council offered a wireless internet service, but this was subsequently withdrawn as funding had ceased.\nThe fishery business still continued in 2018, with individuals such as John Lee, a fifth generation crabman, who sells Cromer Crabs to eateries such as M Restaurants and the Blueprint Caf\u00e9. The problem that he has found is attracting young people to this small industry which calls for working many hours per week during the season. Lobster trapping also continued in North Norfolk, around Sheringham and Cromer, for example.\nManagement of the shoreline.\nNorfolk's low-lying land and easily eroded cliffs, many of which are composed of chalk and clay, make it vulnerable to weathering by the sea. The most recent major erosion event occurred during the North Sea flood of 1953.\nThe low-lying section of coast between Kelling and Lowestoft Ness in Suffolk is currently managed by the British Environment Agency to protect the Broads from sea flooding. Management policy for the North Norfolk coastline is described in the \"North Norfolk Shoreline Management Plan\" published in 2006, but has yet to be accepted by local authorities. The Shoreline Management Plan states that the stretch of coast will be protected for at least another 50 years, but that in the event of sea level rise and post-glacial lowering of land levels in the South East, there may a need for further research to inform future management decisions, including the possibility that the sea defences may have to be realigned to a more sustainable position. Natural England have contributed some research into the impacts on the environment of various realignment options. The draft report of their research was leaked to the press, who created great anxiety by reporting that Natural England plan to abandon a large section of the Norfolk Broads, villages and farmland to the sea to save the rest of the Norfolk coastline from the impact of any adverse climate change.\nMedia.\nTelevision.\nThe county is covered by BBC East and ITV Anglia, which both broadcast from Norwich. Television signals are received from the Tacolneston TV transmitter. However, northwestern parts of Norfolk including King's Lynn, Hunstanton and Wells-next-the-Sea are covered by BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, broadcasting from Hull, and ITV Yorkshire, which broadcast from Leeds. The area receives its television signals from the Belmont TV transmitter.\nRadio.\nBBC Local Radio for the county is served by BBC Radio Norfolk. County-wide commercial radio stations are Heart East, Greatest Hits Radio East, Amber Radio, and Kiss. Community based stations are Future Radio (serving Norwich), Harbour Radio (for Great Yarmouth), KL1 Radio (covering North West Norfolk) and Poppyland Community Radio (serving North Norfolk).\nNewspapers.\nNorfolk is served by these local newspapers:\nEducation.\nPrimary and secondary education.\nBefore 2011, Norfolk had a completely comprehensive state education or \"maintained\" system managed by Norfolk County Council, with secondary school age from 11 to 16 or in some schools with sixth forms, 18 years old. Since then, a number of schools formerly in the \"maintained\" system have left it to become academies, or members of academy groups. Others have become free schools. Both academies and free schools are still publicly funded by the Department of Education but are not with county council management.\nIn many of the rural areas, there is no nearby sixth form, and so sixth form colleges are found in larger towns. There are twelve private, or private schools, including Gresham's School in Holt in the north of the county, Thetford Grammar School in Thetford, which is Britain's fifth oldest extant school, Langley School in Loddon, and several in the city of Norwich, including Norwich School and Norwich High School for Girls. The King's Lynn district has the largest school population. Norfolk is also home to Wymondham College, the UK's largest remaining state boarding school.\nTertiary education.\nThe University of East Anglia is located on the outskirts of Norwich, and Norwich University of the Arts is based in seven buildings in and around St George's Street in the city centre, next to the River Wensum.\nThe City College Norwich and the College of West Anglia are colleges covering Norwich and King's Lynn as well as Norfolk as a whole. Easton &amp; Otley College, west of Norwich, provides agriculture-based courses for the county, parts of Suffolk, and nationally.\nThe University of Suffolk also runs higher education courses in Norfolk, from multiple locations including Great Yarmouth College.\nPolitics.\nLocal.\nNorfolk is administered by Norfolk County Council, which is the top tier local government authority, based at County Hall in Norwich. For details of the authority click on the link Norfolk County Council.\nBelow Norfolk County Council the county is divided into seven second tier district councils: Breckland District, Broadland District, Great Yarmouth Borough, King's Lynn and West Norfolk Borough, North Norfolk District, Norwich City and South Norfolk District.\nBelow the second tier councils the majority of the county is divided into parish and town councils, the lowest tier of local government (the only exceptions being parts of Norwich and King's Lynn urban areas).\nCurrently the Conservative Party control five of the seven district councils: Breckland District, Broadland District, King's Lynn and West Norfolk Borough, Great Yarmouth Borough and South Norfolk District while Norwich City is controlled by the Labour Party and North Norfolk District by the Liberal Democrats.\nNorfolk County Council has been under Conservative control since 2017. There have been two periods when the council has not been run by the Conservative Party, both when no party had overall control, these were 1993\u20132001 and 2013\u20132017.\nFor the full county council election results for 2017 and previous elections click on the link Norfolk County Council elections.\nNational.\nThe county is divided into ten parliamentary constituencies, with Waveney Valley straddling the border with Suffolk:\nIn the 1945 United Kingdom general election, all seats in Norfolk were won by the Labour Party and the National Liberal Party.\nIn the 2010 General Election seven seats were held by the Conservatives and two by the Liberal Democrats. The Labour Party no longer held the urban constituencies they once held in Norwich North and Great Yarmouth, leaving them with no MP's in the whole of East Anglia; the former Labour Home Secretary Charles Clarke was a high level casualty of that election.\nIn the 2015 General Election seven seats were won by the Conservative Party, with Labour winning Norwich South and the Liberal Democrats winning North Norfolk.\nIn the 2017 General Election the 2015 result was repeated.\nIn the 2024 General Election, Norfolk became the only county in the United Kingdom to be represented by MPs from five different parties.\nNorwich Unitary Authority dispute (2006\u20132010).\nIn October 2006, the Department for Communities and Local Government produced a Local Government White Paper inviting councils to submit proposals for unitary restructuring. In January 2007 Norwich submitted its proposal, but this was rejected in December 2007 as it did not meet the criteria for acceptance. In February 2008, the Boundary Committee for England (from 1 April 2010 incorporated in the Local Government Boundary Commission for England) was asked to consider alternative proposals for the whole or part of Norfolk, including whether Norwich should become a unitary authority, separate from Norfolk County Council. In December 2009, the Boundary Committee recommended a single unitary authority covering all of Norfolk, including Norwich.\nHowever, on 10 February 2010, it was announced that, contrary to the December 2009 recommendation of the Boundary Committee, Norwich would be given separate unitary status. The proposed change was strongly resisted, principally by Norfolk County Council and the Conservative opposition in Parliament. Reacting to the announcement, Norfolk County Council issued a statement that it would seek leave to challenge the decision in the courts. A letter was leaked to the local media in which the Permanent Secretary for the Department for Communities and Local Government noted that the decision did not meet all the criteria and that the risk of it \"being successfully challenged in judicial review proceedings is very high\". The Shadow Local Government and Planning Minister, Bob Neill, stated that should the Conservative Party win the 2010 general election, they would reverse the decision.\nFollowing the 2010 general election, Eric Pickles was appointed Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government on 12 May 2010 in a Conservative\u2013Liberal Democrat coalition government. According to press reports, he instructed his department to take urgent steps to reverse the decision and maintain the status quo in line with the Conservative Party manifesto. However, the unitary plans were supported by the Liberal Democrat group on the city council, and by Simon Wright, LibDem MP for Norwich South, who intended to lobby the party leadership to allow the changes to go ahead.\nThe Local Government Act 2010 to reverse the unitary decision for Norwich (and Exeter and Suffolk) received Royal Assent on 16 December 2010. The disputed award of unitary status had meanwhile been referred to the High Court, and on 21 June 2010 the court (Mr. Justice Ouseley, judge) ruled it unlawful, and revoked it. The city has therefore failed to attain unitary status, and the two-tier arrangement of County and District Councils (with Norwich City Council counted among the latter) remains as of 2017.\nSettlements.\nNorfolk's county town and only city is Norwich, one of the largest settlements in England during the Norman era. Norwich is home to the University of East Anglia, and is the county's main business and culture centre. Other principal towns include the port town of King's Lynn and the seaside resort and Broads gateway town of Great Yarmouth.\nBased on the 2011 Census the county's largest centres of population are:\nNorwich (213,166),\nGreat Yarmouth (63,434),\nKing's Lynn (46,093),\nThetford (24,883),\nDereham (20,651),\nWymondham (13,587),\nNorth Walsham (12,463),\nAttleborough (10,549),\nDownham Market (9,994),\nDiss (9,829),\nFakenham (8,285),\nCromer (7,749),\nSheringham (7,367)\nand Swaffham (7,258).\nThere are also several smaller market towns: Aylsham (6,016), Harleston (4,458) and Holt (3,810).\nMuch of the county remains rural in nature and Norfolk is believed to have around 200 lost settlements which have been largely or totally depopulated since the medieval period. These include places lost to coastal erosion, agricultural enclosure, depopulation and the establishment of the Stanford Training Area in 1940.\nTransport.\nRoads.\nNorfolk is one of the few counties in England that does not have a motorway. The A11 connects Norfolk to Cambridge and London, via the M11. From the west, there are only two routes from Norfolk that provide a direct link with the A1: the A47 to the East Midlands and Birmingham, via Peterborough, and the A17 to the East Midlands, via Lincolnshire. These two routes both meet at King's Lynn, which is also the starting point of the A10, providing West Norfolk with a direct link with London, via Ely, Cambridge and Hertford.\nRailways.\nThere are two main railway lines that link Norfolk with London. The Great Eastern Main Line hosts inter-city services from Norwich to Liverpool Street, via Ipswich and Colchester. The Fen line provides regular services between King's Lynn and King's Cross, via Ely and Cambridge.\nIn addition, the Breckland line provides access from Norwich and Thetford to destinations to the west including Peterborough, Nottingham, Sheffield, Manchester and Liverpool.\nAir.\nNorwich Airport provides flights to various European destinations, including a link to Amsterdam which offers onward flights throughout the world.\nDialect, accent and nickname.\nThe Norfolk dialect, sometimes referred to as \"Broad Norfolk,\" has gradually declined over the modern era. Much of its distinctive vocabulary and many traditional phrases have disappeared due to factors such as the influence of radio, television, and migration from other parts of the country. Today, Norfolk speech is often regarded more as a regional accent than a separate dialect, although it retains some distinctive grammatical features.\nPeople from Norfolk are sometimes known as Norfolk Dumplings, an allusion to the flour dumplings that were traditionally a significant part of the local diet.\nMore cutting, perhaps, was the alleged pejorative medical slang term \"Normal for Norfolk\", alluding to the county's perceived status as a quirky rustic backwater due to a high level of inbreeding among residents.\nTourism.\nNorfolk is a popular tourist destination and has several major holiday attractions. There are many seaside resorts, including some of the finest British beaches, such as those at Great Yarmouth, Cromer and Holkham.

It is located at the base of the forebrain and above the midbrain.\nThe putamen and caudate nucleus together form the dorsal striatum. Through various pathways, the putamen is connected to the substantia nigra, the globus pallidus, the claustrum, and the thalamus, in addition to many regions of the cerebral cortex. A primary function of the putamen is to regulate movements at various stages such as in preparation and execution; and to influence various types of learning. It employs GABA, acetylcholine, and enkephalin to perform its functions. The putamen also plays a role in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease.\nHistory.\nThe word \"putamen\" is from Latin, referring to that which \"falls off in pruning\", from \"putare\", meaning \"to prune, to think, or to consider\".\nMost MRI research was focused broadly on the basal ganglia as a whole, for reasons such as poor resolution or hemorrhage within the putamen. Later studies have focused on the basal ganglia and relevant brain-behavior relationships. In the 1970s, the first single-unit recordings were carried out with monkeys, monitoring pallidal neuronal activity related to movement. Since then, more extensive neuronal tracing, stimulation, and imaging research methods including functional MRI, and diffusion weighted MRI that allow for investigation of the putamen have been developed.\nAnatomy.\nThe putamen is a structure in the forebrain. Along with the caudate nucleus it forms the dorsal striatum. The caudate and putamen contain the same types of neurons and circuits \u2013 many neuroanatomists consider the dorsal striatum to be a single structure, divided into two parts by a large fiber tract, the internal capsule, passing through the middle. The putamen, together with the globus pallidus, makes up the lentiform nucleus. The putamen is the outermost portion of the basal ganglia. These are a group of nuclei in the brain that are interconnected with the cerebral cortex, thalamus, and brainstem. The basal ganglia include the striatum, substantia nigra, nucleus accumbens, and the subthalamic nucleus.\nIn mammals, the basal ganglia are associated with motor control, cognition, emotions, learning, and domain-general functions important for executive functioning as well as support for domain-specific languages. The basal ganglia are located bilaterally and have rostral and caudal divisions. The putamen is located in the rostral division as part of the striatum. The basal ganglia receives input from the cerebral cortex via the striatum.\nCaudate nucleus.\nThe caudate works with the putamen to receive the input from the cerebral cortex. Collectively, they can be considered the \"entrance\" to the basal ganglia. Projections from the putamen reach the caudate directly via the caudolenticular grey bridges. The putamen and caudate are jointly connected with the substantia nigra, however the caudate outputs more densely to the substantia nigra pars reticulata while the putamen sends more afferents to the internal globus pallidus.\nSubstantia nigra.\nThe substantia nigra contains two parts: the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNpr). The SNpc obtains input from the putamen and caudate, and sends information back. The SNpr also obtains input from the putamen and caudate. However, it sends the input outside the basal ganglia to control head and eye movements. The SNpc produces dopamine, which is crucial for movements. The SNpc degenerates during Parkinson's disease.\nGlobus pallidus.\nThe globus pallidus contains two parts: the external globus pallidus (GPe) and the internal globus pallidus (GPi). Both regions acquire input from the putamen and caudate and communicate with the subthalamic nucleus. However, mostly the GPi sends GABAergic inhibitory output to the thalamus. The GPi also sends projections to parts of the midbrain, which have been assumed to affect posture control.\nPhysiology.\nTypes of pathways.\nThe putamen (and striatum in general) has numerous, parallel circuits that allow for cortico-subcortico-cortico communication loops. These have been described, broadly, as the direct, indirect, and hyper direct pathways. GABAergic projections of the putamen have an inhibitory effect on the thalamus. Thalamic projections from the centromedian and parafascicular nuclei have an excitatory effect on the putamen. Unlike the thalamus, which has broad reciprocal connectivity, cortical projections with the putamen are afferent, thus sending information as opposed to receiving it. Cortical communication is accomplished via multi-fiber pathways as outlined previously (i.e. via other subcortical structures).\nDopamine.\nThe putamen is part of the nigrostriatal pathway. The Substantia nigra pars compacta, a structure in the brainstem that contains dopaminergic neurons, releases dopamine to the dorsal striatum, which consists of the putamen and caudate nucleus. This dopamine release is highly important for motor control, involving mechanisms for movement promotion (via the Direct Pathway), as well as mechanisms for movement inhibition (via the Indirect Pathway). Striatal neurons expressing D1 type dopaminergic receptors are involved in the Direct Pathway, whereas D2 type dopaminergic receptors are expressed in striatal neurons of the Indirect Pathway.\nIn order to control the amount of dopamine in the synaptic cleft, and the amount of dopamine binding to post synaptic terminals, presynaptic dopaminergic neurons function to reuptake the excess dopamine.\nThe dopaminergic release to the putamen and caudate might be implicated in addictive behaviour as this release seems to play an important role in habit learning.\nOther neurotransmitters.\nThe putamen also plays a role in modulation of other neurotransmitters. It releases GABA, enkephalin, substance P, and acetylcholine. It receives serotonin and glutamate.\nFunction: motor skills.\nThe putamen is interconnected with many other structures, and works in conjunction with them to influence many types of motor behaviors. These include motor planning, learning, and execution, motor preparation, specifying amplitudes of movement, and movement sequences.\nSome neurologists hypothesize that the putamen also plays a role in the selection of movement (e.g. Tourette syndrome) and the \"automatic\" performance of previously learned movements (e.g. Parkinson's disease).\nIn one study it was found that the putamen controls limb movement. The goal of this study was to determine whether particular cell activity in the putamen of primates was related to the direction of limb movement or to the underlying pattern of muscular activity. Two monkeys were trained to perform tasks that involved the movement of loads. The tasks were created so that movement could be distinguished from muscle activity. Neurons in the putamen were selected for monitoring only if they were related both to the task and to arm movements outside the task. It was shown that 50% of the neurons that were monitored were related to the direction of movement, independent of the load.\nAnother study was done to investigate movement extent and speed using PET mapping of regional cerebral blood flow in 13 humans. Movement tasks were performed with a joystick-controlled cursor. Statistical tests were done to calculate the extent of movements and what regions of the brain the movements correlate to. It was found that \"increasing movement extent was associated with parallel increases of rCBF in bilateral basal ganglia (BG; putamen and globus pallidus) and ipsilateral cerebellum.\" This not only shows that the putamen affects movement but it also shows that the putamen integrates with other structures in order to perform tasks.\nOne study was done in order to specifically investigate how the basal ganglia influences the learning of sequential movements. Two monkeys were trained to press a series of buttons in sequence. The methods used were designed to be able to monitor the well-learned tasks versus the new tasks. Muscimol was injected into various parts of the basal ganglia, and it was found that \"the learning of new sequences became deficient after injections in the anterior caudate and putamen, but not the middle-posterior putamen\". This shows that different areas of the striatum are utilized when performing various aspects of the learning of sequential movements.\nRole in learning.\nIn many studies, it has become apparent that the putamen plays a role in many types of learning. Some examples are listed below:\nReinforcement and implicit learning.\nAlong with various types of movement, the putamen also affects reinforcement learning and implicit learning.\nReinforcement learning is interacting with the environment and catering actions to maximize the outcome. Implicit learning is a passive process where people are exposed to information and acquire knowledge through exposure. Although the exact mechanisms are not known, it is clear that dopamine and tonically active neurons play a key role here. Tonically active neurons are cholinergic interneurons that fire during the entire duration of the stimulus and fire at about 0.5\u20133 impulses per second. Phasic neurons are the opposite and only fire an action potential when movement occurs.\nCategory learning.\nOne particular study used patients with focal lesions on the basal ganglia (specifically the putamen) due to stroke in order to study category learning. The advantage to using these types of patients is that dopaminergic projections to the prefrontal cortex are more likely to be intact. Also, in these patients, it is easier to relate specific brain structures to function because the lesion only occurs in a specific place. The goal of this study was to determine whether or not these lesions affect rule-based and information-integration task learning. Rule-based tasks are learned via hypothesis-testing dependent on working memory. Information-integration tasks are ones wherein the accuracy is maximized when information from two sources are integrated at a pre-decisional stage, which follows a procedural-based system.\nSeven participants with basal ganglia lesions were used in the experiment, along with nine control participants. It is important to note that the caudate was not affected. The participants were tested for each type of learning during separate sessions, so the information processes would not interfere with each other. During each session, participants sat in front of a computer screen and various lines were displayed. These lines were created by using a randomization technique where random samples were taken from one of four categories. For ruled-based testing, these samples were used to construct lines of various length and orientation that fell into these four separate categories. After the stimulus was displayed, the subjects were asked to press 1 of 4 buttons to indicate which category the line fell into. The same process was repeated for information-integration tasks, and the same stimuli were used, except that the category boundaries were rotated 45\u00b0. This rotation causes the subject to integrate the quantitative information about the line before determining what category it is in.\nIt was found that subjects in the experimental group were impaired while performing rule-based tasks, but not information-integration ones. After statistical testing, it was also hypothesized that the brain began using information-integration techniques to solve the rule-based learning tasks. Since rule-based tasks use the hypothesis-testing system of the brain, it can be concluded that the hypothesis-testing system of the brain was damaged/weakened. It is known that the caudate and working memories are part of this system. Therefore, it was confirmed that the putamen is involved in category learning, competition between the systems, feed-back processing in rule-based tasks, and is involved in the processing of pre-frontal regions (which relate to working memory and executive functioning). Now it is known that not only the basal ganglia and caudate affect category learning.\nRole in \"hate circuit\".\nTentative studies have suggested that the putamen may play a role in the so-called \"hate circuit\" of the brain. A recent study was done by the department of cell and developmental biology at University College London. An fMRI was carried out on subjects while they viewed a picture of people they hated and people who were \"neutral\". During the experiment, a \"hate score\" was recorded for each picture. The activity in subcortical areas of the brain implied that the \"hate circuit\" involves the superior frontal gyrus, the putamen and the insula. It has been theorized that the \"putamen plays a role in the perception of contempt and disgust, and may be part of the motor system that's mobilized to take action.\" It was also found that the amount of activity in the hate circuit correlates with the amount of hate a person declares, which could have legal implications concerning malicious crimes.\nRole in transgender individuals.\nThe putamen of transgender women was found to have significantly larger amounts of grey matter compared to the putamen of cisgender men. This possibly suggests that a difference in the putamen may exist between trans women and cisgender men.\nPathology.\nParkinson's disease.\nAfter discovering the function of the putamen, it has become apparent to neurologists that the putamen and other parts of the basal ganglia play an important role in Parkinson's disease and other diseases that involve the degeneration of neurons.\nParkinson's disease is the slow and steady loss of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta. In Parkinson's disease the putamen plays a key role because its inputs and outputs are interconnected to the substantia nigra and the globus pallidus. In Parkinson's disease the activity in direct pathways to interior globus pallidus decreases and activity in indirect pathways to external globus pallidus increases. It has also been noted that Parkinson's patients have a difficult time with motor planning.\nOther diseases and disorders.\nThe following diseases and disorders are linked with the putamen:\nIn other animals.\nThe putamen in humans is relatively similar in structure and function to other animals. Therefore, many studies on the putamen have been done on animals (monkeys, rats, cats, etc.), as well as humans. However, inter-species variations are indeed observed in mammals, and have been documented for white matter putaminal connectivity. Variation is primarily related to structural connectivity patterns, while somatotopic organization principles are retained. Primate research since the 1980s through to the present has established that cortical regions related to higher-order cognition primarily send afferent neurons to the rostral-most portion of the putamen, while the remainder of this structure in primates primarily serves sensorimotor functions and is densely interconnected with primary and supplementary motor regions.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "37609", "revid": "31384714", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37609", "title": "Striatum", "text": "Nucleus in the basal ganglia of the brain\nThe striatum (pl.: striata) or corpus striatum is a cluster of interconnected nuclei that make up the largest structure of the subcortical basal ganglia. The striatum is a critical component of the motor and reward systems; receives glutamatergic and dopaminergic inputs from different sources; and serves as the primary input to the rest of the basal ganglia.\nFunctionally, the striatum coordinates multiple aspects of cognition, including both motor and action planning, decision-making, motivation, reinforcement, and reward perception. The striatum is made up of the caudate nucleus, the putamen, and the ventral striatum. The lentiform nucleus is made up of the larger putamen, and the smaller globus pallidus. Strictly speaking the globus pallidus is part of the striatum. It is common practice, however, to implicitly exclude the globus pallidus when referring to striatal structures.\nIn primates, the striatum is divided into the ventral striatum and the dorsal striatum, subdivisions that are based upon function and connections. The ventral striatum consists of the nucleus accumbens and the olfactory tubercle. The dorsal striatum consists of the caudate nucleus and the putamen. A white matter nerve tract (the internal capsule) in the dorsal striatum separates the caudate nucleus and the putamen. Anatomically, the term \"striatum\" describes its striped (striated) appearance of grey-and-white matter.\nStructure.\nThe striatum is the largest structure of the basal ganglia. The striatum is divided into two subdivisions, a ventral striatum and a dorsal striatum, based upon function and connections. It is also divisible into a matrix and embedded striosomes.\nVentral striatum.\nThe ventral striatum is composed of the nucleus accumbens and the olfactory tubercle. The nucleus accumbens is made up of the nucleus accumbens core and the nucleus accumbens shell, which differ by neural populations. The olfactory tubercle receives input from the olfactory bulb but has not been shown to play a role in processing smell. In non-primate species, the islands of Calleja are included. The ventral striatum is associated with the limbic system and has been implicated as a vital part of the circuitry for decision making and reward-related behavior.\nDorsal striatum.\nThe dorsal striatum is composed of the caudate nucleus and the putamen.\nPrimarily it mediates cognition and involves motor and executive function. The dorsal striatum can be further subdivided into the dorsomedial striatum, and the dorsolateral striatum. Both of these areas have different roles in the acquisition of learnt behaviour and skill formation. The dorsomedial region receives projections from the frontal and the parietal cortices. The dorsolateral region receives projections from the sensorimotor cortex.\nMatrix and striosomes.\nNeurochemistry studies have used staining techniques on the striatum that have identified two distinct striatal compartments, the matrix, and the striosome (or patch). The matrix is seen to be rich in acetylcholinesterase, while the embedded striosomes are acetylcholinesterase-poor. The matrix forms the bulk of the striatum, and receives input from most areas of the cerebral cortex. Clusters of neurons in the matrix, called matrisomes receive a similar input. Their output goes to both regions of the globus pallidus and to the substantia nigra pars reticulata.\nThe striosomes receive input from the prefrontal cortex and give outputs to the substantia nigra pars compacta. There are more striosomes present in the dorsal striatum making up 10-15% of the striatal volume, than in the ventral striatum.\nCell types.\nTypes of cells in the striatum include:\nThere are two regions of neurogenesis in the brain \u2013 the subventricular zone (SVZ) in the lateral ventricles, and the dentate gyrus in the hippocampal formation. Neuroblasts that form in the lateral ventricle adjacent to the striatum, integrate in the striatum. This has been noted in the human striatum following an ischemic stroke. Injury caused to the striatum stimulates the migration of neuroblasts from the SVZ, to the striatum, where they differentiate into adult neurons. The normal passage of SVZ neuroblasts is to the olfactory bulb but this traffic is diverted to the striatum after an ischemic stroke. However, few of the new developed neurons survive.\nInputs.\nThe largest connection is from the cortex, in terms of cell axons. Many parts of the neocortex innervate the dorsal striatum. The cortical pyramidal neurons projecting to the striatum are located in layers II-VI, with the most dense projections come from layer V. They end mainly on the dendritic spines of the spiny neurons. They are glutamatergic, exciting striatal neurons.\nThe striatum is seen as having its own internal microcircuitry. The ventral striatum receives direct input from multiple regions in the cerebral cortex and limbic structures such as the amygdala, thalamus, and hippocampus, as well as the entorhinal cortex and the inferior temporal gyrus. Its primary input is to the basal ganglia system. Additionally, the mesolimbic pathway projects from the ventral tegmental area to the nucleus accumbens of the ventral striatum.\nAnother well-known afferent is the nigrostriatal connection arising from the neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta. While cortical axons synapse mainly on spine heads of spiny neurons, nigral axons synapse mainly on spine shafts.\nIn primates, the thalamostriatal afferent comes from the central median-parafascicular complex of the thalamus (see primate basal ganglia system). This afferent is glutamatergic. The participation of truly intralaminar neurons is much more limited.\nThe striatum also receives afferents from other elements of the basal ganglia such as the subthalamic nucleus (glutamatergic) or the external globus pallidus (GABAergic).\nTargets.\nThe primary outputs of the ventral striatum project to the ventral pallidum, then the medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus, which is part of the frontostriatal circuit. Additionally, the ventral striatum projects to the globus pallidus, and substantia nigra pars reticulata. Some of its other outputs include projections to the extended amygdala, lateral hypothalamus, and pedunculopontine nucleus.\nStriatal outputs from both the dorsal and ventral components are primarily composed of medium spiny neurons (MSNs), a type of projection neuron, which have two primary phenotypes: \"indirect\" MSNs that express D2-like receptors and \"direct\" MSNs that express D1-like receptors.\nThe main nucleus of the basal ganglia is the striatum which projects directly to the globus pallidus via a pathway of striatopallidal fibers. The striato-pallidal pathway has a whitish appearance due to the myelinated fibers. This projection comprises successively the external globus pallidus (GPe), the internal globus pallidus (GPi), the pars compacta of the substantia nigra (SNc), and the pars reticulata of substantia nigra (SNr). The neurons of this projection are inhibited by GABAergic synapses from the dorsal striatum. Among these targets, the GPe does not send axons outside the system. Others send axons to the superior colliculus. Two others comprise the output to the thalamus, forming two separate channels: one through the internal segment of the globus pallidus to the ventral oralis nuclei of the thalamus and from there to the cortical supplementary motor area and another through the substantia nigra to the ventral anterior nuclei of the thalamus and from there to the frontal cortex and the occulomotor cortex.\nBlood supply.\nDeep penetrating striate arteries supply blood to the striatum. These arteries include the recurrent artery of Heubner arising from the anterior cerebral artery, and the lenticulostriate arteries arising from the middle cerebral artery.\nFunction.\nThe ventral striatum, and the nucleus accumbens in particular, primarily mediates reward, cognition, reinforcement, and motivational salience. By contrast, the dorsal striatum primarily mediates cognition involving motor function, certain executive functions (e.g., inhibitory control and impulsivity), and stimulus-response learning. There is a small degree of overlap, as the dorsal striatum is also a component of the reward system that, along with the nucleus accumbens core, mediates the encoding of new motor programs associated with future reward acquisition (e.g., the conditioned motor response to a reward cue).\nThe striatum is also thought to play a role in an at least partially dissociable executive control network for language, applied to both verbal working memory and verbal attention. These models take the form of a frontal-striatal network for language processing. While the striatum is often not included in models of language processing, as most models only include cortical regions, integrative models are becoming more popular in light of imaging studies, lesion studies on aphasic patients, and studies of language disorders concomitant with diseases known to affect the striatum like Parkinson's and Huntington's disease.\nMetabotropic dopamine receptors are present both on spiny neurons and on cortical axon terminals. Second messenger cascades triggered by activation of these dopamine receptors can modulate pre- and postsynaptic function, both in the short term and in the long term. In humans, the striatum is activated by stimuli associated with reward, but also by aversive, novel, unexpected, or intense stimuli, and cues associated with such events. fMRI evidence suggests that the common property linking these stimuli, to which the striatum is reacting, is salience under the conditions of presentation. A number of other brain areas and circuits are also related to reward, such as frontal areas. Functional maps of the striatum reveal interactions with widely distributed regions of the cerebral cortex important to a diverse range of functions.\nThe interplay between the striatum and the prefrontal cortex is relevant for behavior, particularly adolescent development as proposed by the dual systems model.\nClinical significance.\nParkinson's disease and other movement disorders.\nParkinson's disease results in loss of dopaminergic innervation to the dorsal striatum (and other basal ganglia) and a cascade of consequences. Atrophy of the striatum is also involved in Huntington's disease, and movement disorders such as chorea, choreoathetosis, and dyskinesias. These have also been described as \"circuit disorders\" of the basal ganglia.\nAddiction.\nAddiction, a disorder of the brain's reward system, arises through the overexpression of DeltaFosB (\u0394FosB), a transcription factor, in the D1-type medium spiny neurons of the ventral striatum. \u0394FosB is an inducible gene which is increasingly expressed in the nucleus accumbens as a result of repeatedly using an addictive drug or overexposure to other addictive stimuli.\nSchizophrenia spectrum disorders.\nThe mesolimbic hypothesis of schizophrenia has long emphasized the role of hyperdopaminergia in the mesolimbic pathway, which extends from the ventral tegmental area to the ventral striatum. Abnormally elevated dopaminergic transmission in this pathway has been associated with the emergence of positive symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions. Most antipsychotic treatments exert their effects by reducing dopamine binding to receptors in this region. More recent evidence, however, suggests that the pathway from the substantia nigra to the dorsal striatum may also play a significant role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. This has led to the development of the mesostriatal hypothesis, which expands the focus beyond the ventral striatum to include dopaminergic dysfunction in the dorsal components of the striatum and could help accounting for the negative and cognitive symptoms.\nBipolar disorder.\nAn association has been observed between striatal expression of variants of the PDE10A gene and some bipolar I disorder patients. Variants of other genes, DISC1 and GNAS, have been associated with bipolar II disorder.\nAutism spectrum disorder.\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by cognitive inflexibility and poor understanding of social systems. This inflexible behavior originates in defects in the prefrontal cortex as well as the striatal circuits. The defects in the striatum seem to specifically contribute to the motor, social and communication impairments seen in ASD patients. In mice which have an ASD-like phenotype induced via the overexpression of the eukaryotic initiation of translation factor 4E, it has been shown that these defects seem to stem from the reduced ability to store and process information in the striatum, which leads to the difficulty seen in forming new motor patterns, as well as disengaging from existing ones.\nDysfunction.\nDysfunction in the ventral striatum can lead to a variety of disorders, most notably depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Because of its involvement in reward pathways, the ventral striatum has also been implicated in playing a critical role in addiction. It has been well established that the ventral striatum is strongly involved in mediating the reinforcing effects of drugs, especially stimulants, through dopaminergic stimulation.\nLanguage disorders.\nLesions to the striatum have been associated with deficits in speech production and comprehension. While striatal damage can impact all levels of language, damage can broadly be characterized as affecting the ability to manipulate linguistic units and rules, resulting in the promotion of default linguistic forms in conflicting situations in which selection, inhibition, and monitoring load is increased. Two subregions of the striatum have been shown to be particularly important in language: the caudate nucleus and left putamen. Lesions localized to the caudate nucleus, as well as direct electrical stimulation, can result in lexical paraphasias and perservations (continuations of an utterance after the stimulus has ceased), which is associated with inhibited executive control, in the sense that executive control allows for the selection of the best choice among competing alternatives. Stimulation of the putamen results in the inhibition of articulatory sequences and the inability to initiate motor speech commands.\nHistory.\nIn the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the term \"corpus striatum\" was used to designate many distinct, deep, infracortical elements of the hemisphere. Etymologically, it is derived from (Latin) \"striatus\" = \"grooved, striated\" and the English \"striated\" = having parallel lines or grooves on the surface. In 1876 David Ferrier contributed decades of research to the subject; concluding that the corpus striatum was vital in the \"organization and generation of voluntary movement\". In 1941, C\u00e9cile and Oskar Vogt simplified the nomenclature by proposing the term \"striatum\" for all elements in the basal ganglia built with striatal elements: the caudate nucleus, the putamen, and the fundus striati, which is the ventral part linking the two preceding together ventrally to the inferior part of the internal capsule.\nThe term neostriatum was coined by comparative anatomists comparing the subcortical structures between vertebrates, because it was thought to be a phylogenetically newer section of the corpus striatum. The term is still used by some sources, including Medical Subject Headings.\nOther animals.\nIn birds the term used was the \"paleostriatum augmentatum\", while in the new avian terminology listing (as of 2002) for \"neostriatum\" this has been changed to the \"nidopallium\".\nIn non-primate species, the islands of Calleja are included in the ventral striatum.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

For example, the Japanese word \"sukiyaki\" is pronounced and may sound like to an English speaker, but the lips can be seen to compress for the . Something similar happens in English words like \"peculiar\" and \"potato\" .\nVoiceless vowels are also an areal feature in languages of the American Southwest (like Hopi and Keres), the Great Basin (including all Numic languages), and the Great Plains, where they are present in Numic Comanche but also in Algonquian Cheyenne, and the Caddoan language Arikara. It also occurs in Woleaian, in contrast to the other Micronesian languages, which instead delete it outright.\nContrastively voiceless vowels have been reported several times without ever being verified (L&amp;M 1996:315).\nSonorants may also be contrastively, not just environmentally, voiceless. Standard Tibetan, for example, has a voiceless in \"Lhasa\", which sounds similar to but is less noisy than the voiceless lateral fricative in Welsh; it contrasts with a modally voiced . Welsh contrasts several voiceless sonorants: , , , and , the last represented by \"rh\".\nIn Moksha, there is even a voiceless palatal approximant (written in Cyrillic as \u27e8\u0439\u0445\u27e9 \"jh\") along with and (written as \u27e8\u043b\u0445\u27e9 \"lh\" and \u27e8\u0440\u0445\u27e9 \"rh\"). The last two have palatalized counterparts and (\u27e8\u043b\u044c\u0445\u27e9 and \u27e8\u0440\u044c\u0445\u27e9). Kildin Sami has also \u27e8\u048b\u27e9.\nLack of voicing contrast in obstruents.\nMany languages lack a distinction between voiced and voiceless obstruents (stops, affricates, and fricatives). This is the case in nearly all Australian languages, and is widespread elsewhere, for example in Mandarin Chinese, Korean, Danish, Estonian and the Polynesian languages.\nIn many such languages, obstruents are realized as voiced in voiced environments, such as between vowels or between a vowel and a nasal, and voiceless elsewhere, such as at the beginning or end of the word or next to another obstruent. That is the case in Dravidian and Australian languages and in Korean but not in Mandarin or Polynesian. Usually, the variable sounds are transcribed with the voiceless IPA letters, but for Australian languages, the letters for voiced consonants are often used.\nIt appears that voicelessness is not a single phenomenon in such languages. In some, such as the Polynesian languages, the vocal folds are required to actively open to allow an unimpeded (silent) airstream, which is sometimes called a \"breathed\" phonation (not to be confused with breathy voice). In others, such as many Australian languages, voicing ceases during the hold of a stop (few Australian languages have any other kind of obstruent) because airflow is insufficient to sustain it, and if the vocal folds open, that is only from passive relaxation.\nThus, Polynesian stops are reported to be held for longer than Australian stops and are seldom voiced, but Australian stops are prone to having voiced variants (L&amp;M 1996:53), and the languages are often represented as having no phonemically voiceless consonants at all.\nIn Southeast Asia, when stops occur at the end of a word, they are voiceless because the glottis is closed, not open, so they are said to be unphonated (have no phonation) by some phoneticians, who considered \"breathed\" voicelessness to be a phonation.\nYidiny consonants have no underlyingly voiceless consonants.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The network carries news bulletins, documentaries, and other factual programmes; it broadcasts from studios in London, Washington, D.C., and Singapore.\nLaunched on 11 March 1991 as BBC World Service Television outside Europe, its name was changed to BBC World on 16 January 1995 and to BBC World News on 21 April 2008. On 3 April 2023, the channel's programming and talent was consolidated with the BBC News channel in the UK as part of a restructuring; both channels are now branded as BBC News, and are structured to use a common schedule with domestic opt-outs for UK-specific news coverage and programmes.\nUnlike the BBC's domestic channels, it is funded by subscription and advertising revenues, and not by the United Kingdom television licence. As such, it is not broadcast in the UK directly, although selected programmes and bulletins had been carried on the domestic BBC News channel (especially during overnight hours), and vice versa (including domestic programmes such as \"Click\" and \"HARDtalk\", and during breaking news and special events in the UK) even prior to the consolidation.\nAccording to the BBC, the combined seven channels of the Global News operations have the largest audience market share among all its rivals, with an estimated 99 million viewers weekly in 2016\u20132017, part of the estimated 121\u00a0million weekly audience of all its operations.\nHistory.\nRolling news began in the UK on 5 February 1989 when Sky News was launched and on 16 January 1995, the BBC launched an international news channel BBC World. However it was meant for global audiences and normally wasn't available to viewers in the UK. In May 1996, the BBC announced that it was to launch a UK rolling news service as part of its move into digital broadcasting.\nBBC News 24 went on air on 9 November 1997, nearly a year before digital television was launched in the UK and due to a lack of space on satellite, the channel was only available on cable, with an overnight shop window on BBC One when that channel was not on air. However, Sky News had complained about the costs associated with running a channel that only a minority could view from the licence fee. Sky News claimed that a number of British cable operators had been incentivised to carry News 24 (which, as a licence-fee funded channel was made available to such operators for free) in preference to the commercial Sky News. However, in September 1999 the European Commission ruled against a complaint made by Sky News that the publicly funded channel was unfair and illegal under EU law. The Commission ruled that the licence fee should be considered state aid but that such aid was justified due to the public service remit of the BBC and that it did not exceed actual costs.\nThe advent of digital television in the United Kingdom in autumn 1998 saw the channel launch on Sky's new digital satellite service and a month later it started to broadcast via digital terrestrial television. Initially it was difficult to obtain a digital satellite or terrestrial receiver without a subscription to Sky or ONdigital respectively, but following the demise of ITV Digital in 2002 and the subsequent launch of Freeview, the channel started to become much more widely available and the BBC Governors' annual report for 2005/2006 reported that average audience figures for fifteen-minute periods had reached 8.6% in multichannel homes. The 2004 report also claimed that the channel outperformed Sky News in both weekly and monthly reach in multichannel homes for the January 2004 period, and for the first time in two years moved ahead of Sky News in being perceived as the channel best for news.\nIn 2005, the Head of television news Peter Horrocks outlined plans to provide more funding and resources for the channel and shift the corporation's emphasis regarding news away from the traditional BBC One bulletins and across to the rolling news channel. The introduction of simulcasts of the main bulletins on the channel was to allow the news bulletins to pool resources rather than work against each other at key times in the face of competition, particularly from Sky News.\nThe channel relocated, along with the remaining BBC News services at Television Centre, to the newly refurbished Broadcasting House on 18 March 2013 at 13:00 GMT. Presentation and on-screen graphics were refreshed, with new full HD studios and a live newsroom backdrop. Moving cameras in the newsroom form part of the top of the hour title sequence and are used at the start of weather bulletins.\nBBC News HD.\nAs a result of the move to Broadcasting House, BBC News gained new studios and equipment to be able to broadcast in high-definition. On 5 August 2013, the international feed of BBC News was offered as a High Definition (HD) feed across the Middle East when it launched its international HD channel on the Arab Satellite Communications Organization. Arabsat was the BBC's first distribution partner in the Middle East to offer the channel in HD. On 1 April 2015, the then-named BBC World News Channel started broadcasting in high definition on the 11.229\u00a0GHz/V transponder on Astra 1KR at the 19.2\u00b0E orbital position, available free-to-air to viewers with 60\u00a0cm dishes across Europe and coastal North Africa.\nOn 16 July 2013, the BBC announced that a high-definition (HD) simulcast of BBC News would be launched by early 2014. HD output from BBC News has been simulcast on BBC One HD and BBC Two HD since the move to Broadcasting House in March 2013. The channel launched on 10December 2013 (at an earlier date than originally planned) and rolled out nationwide over the next six months (as did BBC Four HD, CBBC HD and CBeebies HD).\nBBC News HD was removed from Freeview on 30 June 2022 due to the closure of the COM7 multiplex. There are HD versions of BBC News on BBC iPlayer, Freesat channel 200, Sky channel 503, and Virgin Media channel 601.\n2008 rebranding.\nOn 21 April 2008, BBC News 24 was renamed \"BBC News\" on the channel itself, and referred to as the \"BBC News Channel\" on other BBC services. This was part of the Creative Futures plan, launched in 2006, to bring all BBC News output under the single brand name.\nThe BBC News Channel moved from the Studio N8 set, which became home to BBC World News, to what was the home of the national news in Studio N6, allowing the channel to share its set with the \"BBC News at One\" and the \"BBC News at Ten\" \u2013 with other bulletins moving to Studio TC7.\nConsolidation with BBC World News.\nOn 26 May 2022, as part of planned cuts and streamlining across the broadcaster, the BBC announced plans for consolidation of the domestic BBC News channel in the UK with BBC World News. The domestic and international versions would share content, while maintaining the ability to opt out from the shared feed for domestic coverage if warranted. The BBC promoted that the service would offer \"new flagship programmes built around high-profile journalists, and programmes commissioned for multiple platforms\".\nThe BBC announced a new presenter line-up for the merged service in February 2023, led by Matthew Amroliwala, Christian Fraser, Yalda Hakim, Lucy Hockings, and Maryam Moshiri. On 3 April 2023, the BBC World News channel rebranded as BBC News, formally marking the implementation of the unified service with the UK feed opting out for UK-specific programming, such as BBC television newscasts and \"Newsnight\", and coverage of UK-specific news not judged to be significant enough to warrant rolling coverage globally. Overall, the changes resulted in the layoffs of about 50 employees, including presenters David Eades, Joanna Gosling, and Tim Willcox.\nYalda Hakim left the channel to join Sky News in September 2023, meaning that Maryam Moshiri could have her own programme in the slot of Hakim's former Daily Global programme.\nIn February 2024, Ben Brown, Geeta Guru-Murthy, and Anita McVeigh rejoined the news channel after a year off air as chief presenters.\nDuring the 2024 general election campaign, BBC News temporarily unwound the unified service, and reverted to broadcasting a domestic feed of rolling coverage from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily, as well as an additional UK-specific bulletin at 11 p.m. following \"Newsnight\". This continued through the State Opening of Parliament, after which the prior schedule was reinstated beginning 18 July. The 11 p.m. bulletin remained until October 2024, when it was replaced with \"World News America\". In January 2025, the UK feed dropped its simulcast of \"BBC Breakfast\" as a pilot, with world feed programming now carried in its timeslot; executive news editor Paul Royall considered the simulcast redundant, citing that the majority of its viewership came from BBC One and iPlayer.\nBroadcasting.\nLive news output originates from studios B, C and E in Broadcasting House with some recorded programming from Broadcasting House studios A and D and the BBC Millbank studio, as well as Manchester, Nairobi, Singapore and Washington, D.C. The BBC News newsroom is now part of the new consolidated BBC Newsroom in Broadcasting House along with BBC World Service and UK domestic news services.\nPreviously, the channel was broadcast in 4:3, with the news output fitted into a frame for both digital and analogue broadcasting, resulting in black bands at the top and bottom of the screen. On 13 January 2009 at 09:57 GMT, the then-named BBC World News switched its broadcast to format, initially in Europe on the Astra 1L satellite, and then, from 20 January 2009, on the Eutelsat Hot Bird 6 satellite which fed other broadcast feeds in the Asian region. The channel ceased broadcasting on analogue satellite on 18 April 2006.\nBBC World News was named \"Best International News Channel\" at the Association for International Broadcasting Awards in November 2006. It won a Peabody Award in 2007 for \"White Horse Village\" and another in 2009 for \"Where Giving Life is a Death Sentence.\"\nWorldwide.\nThe channel is available in the US as part of Sling's World News add-on package. The international feed of BBC News was available on LiveStation from 2012 until the platform closed in 2016, along with the UK simulcast. The channel was added to various free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) platforms in the United States, including Pluto TV, Xumo Play, Samsung TV Plus, and Sling Freestream, in March 2024. Apart from advertising, the FAST version of the channel is identical to the version already available through traditional U.S. cable and satellite providers.\nBBC News claims to be watched by a weekly audience of 74 million in over 200 countries and territories worldwide. BBC News is most commonly watched as a free-to-air (FTA) channel. The channel is available in Europe and many parts of the world via subscription television providers in cable, satellite, IPTV and streaming platforms.\nIn the United States, the channel is available through providers such as Cablevision, Comcast, Spectrum, Verizon Fios, and U-verse TV. As of 2023, the American distribution and advertising sales for the channel are handled by AMC Networks, who own and operate BBC America under license from the BBC.\nIn addition, BBC News syndicates its daytime and evening news programmes to public television stations throughout the US, originally maintaining a distribution partnership with Garden City, New York-based WLIW that lasted from 1998 until October 2008, when the BBC and WLIW mutually decided not to renew the contract. BBC News subsequently entered into an agreement with Community Television of Southern California, Inc., in which Los Angeles PBS member station KCET (which was a public independent station from 2011 to 2018) would take over distribution rights to \"BBC World News America\" (the KCET agreement has since been extended to encompass a half-hour simulcast of the 90-minute-long midday news bulletin \"GMT\", which airs in the US as a morning show, and a weekly edition of the BBC news-magazine \"Newsnight\"). \nSince June 2019, the distribution of the programme has been handled by Washington, D.C. PBS member WETA, which also produces other networked news and public affairs programmes such as the \"PBS NewsHour\" and \"Washington Week\". PBS separately began distributing another programme aired by the channel, \"Beyond 100 Days\", as a tape-delayed late night broadcast on 2 January 2018, as an interim replacement for \"Charlie Rose\". Unlike \"GMT\" and \"BBC World News America\", \"Beyond 100 Days\" is distributed exclusively to PBS member stations as part of the service's base schedule.\nChina banned BBC News in 2021, although access had already been heavily restricted before then and what was carried was censored, with parts of the show being blacked out by censors operating live. It was banned because of its coverage of the persecution of Uyghur people in China and in retaliation for CGTN being banned from the British market for violating national broadcast regulations.\nUnited Kingdom.\nThe TV platforms in the UK (i.e. Freeview, Sky, BT TV, Freesat, Virgin) do not officially offer the international feed of BBC News as a standalone full-time channel because it carries, and is funded by, advertising. (The BBC's domestic channels are funded by a television licence fee which households and establishments that want to watch television programmes as they are being broadcast must pay). However, it can be easily received due to its free-to-air status on many European satellite systems, including Astra and Hot Bird, and is available in selected London hotels. The UK's TV platforms, however, do provide the UK feed of BBC News channel, which carries much of the same programming. The international feed of BBC News can also be viewed in the public areas of Broadcasting House (in the lobby and caf\u00e9).\nHowever, some programmes are officially available to UK audiences through the channel's UK feed. Such programmes air on the BBC's domestic channels, and some are available on demand on the BBC's iPlayer. From 00:00 to 05:00 UK time, the top-of-the-hour news bulletins are broadcast on both the UK and international feeds of the channel. At 01:30 on weekdays, \"Asia Business Report\" and \"Sport Today\" also air on both channels. There is a simulcast of the 05:00 UK edition of \"The Briefing\" and \"Business Briefing\" on BBC One and the BBC News channel. This programme was previously branded as \"The World Today\" (later a generic BBC World News bulletin) and \"World Business Report\" respectively. At 08:30 UK time, \"Worklife\" airs on the BBC News Channel. BBC News also produces a version of \"Outside Source\" at 21:00 UK time Monday\u2013Thursday (shown on the BBC News Channel), \"World News Today\" at 19:00 Monday\u2013Friday (shown on BBC Four), and 21:00 Friday\u2013Sunday (shown on the BBC News Channel). \"World News Today\" replaced \"The World\", which had been broadcast as a simulcast on BBC Four between 2002 and 2007.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic saw an increase of simulcasts between BBC News and BBC World News with simulcasting running through the morning (10:00 to 11:00) that was also shared with BBC Two, and the evening (19:00 to 20:00 &amp; 12:00 to 22:00). The additional simulcasting was made permanent in August 2020. Consequently, the two channels now simulcast every day from 10:00 to 11:00; on weekdays from 19:00 to 06:00, apart from the \"BBC News at Ten\" and for an hour at 20:00; and between 21:00 to 06:00, apart from the evening BBC One bulletin, over the weekend.\nThe BBC implemented a wider consolidation of the networks' lineups in April 2023.\nProgramming.\nLive news programmes:\nLive business and sports programmes:\nPre-recorded programmes:\nFormer programmes:\nBBC News bulletins.\nHalf-hour \"BBC News\" bulletins are made available to PBS stations in the US through Los Angeles's KCET, a non-commercial independent public television station which has been separate from PBS since the beginning of 2011 due to a rights-fee dispute (it returned to being a minor PBS member station in 2019 after a merger with the major PBS member-station in the market). 80 to 90% of Americans can receive the bulletins, with PBS member stations having scheduling discretion. The programme is broadcast on several PBS stations in markets such as New York City and Washington DC.\nOn PBS stations, \"BBC News\" is not broadcast with traditional commercials (the breaks are filled with news stories) but omits the Met Office international weather forecast at the end of the programme, replacing it with underwriting announcements. The PBS broadcasts are tape-delayed on some stations.\nBBC America formerly aired a three-hour block of BBC News programmes from 05:00 to 08:00 on weekdays, until the stabilisation of the network's carriage in the United States. Met Office forecasts were removed, and it was broadcast with advertisements.\nMany airlines around the world also play pre-recorded extracts of BBC News, have text headlines from it, or have a full bulletin available on the in-flight entertainment systems.\nPrevious bulletins.\nAnother BBC World News programme, the hour-long \"BBC World News America\", aired on BBC America at 19:00 ET. A second broadcast at 22:00 ET ended in 2010 when BBC America introduced a second feed for the western time zones of the US. On 18 February 2011, it was announced that \"BBC World News America\" would no longer be broadcast on BBC America and would instead be broadcast only on BBC World and local PBS stations in the US as a 30-minute programme.\nThe channel also produced short bulletins for public transport services in Singapore and Hong Kong:\nThese broadcasts began with the statement: \"Welcome to BBC World News on board the Singapore Mass Rapid Transit and Hong Kong MTR\". The short bulletin was updated twice a day and has since been replaced by a similar programme from Mediacorp's CNA.\nTravellers on the Heathrow Express rail service between London Paddington and Heathrow Airport could watch a summary of the headlines from BBC World News on the LCD screens provided.\nNews presenters.\nFormer presenters.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPresentation.\nThe channel was criticised at launch for its style of presentation, with accusations of it being less authoritative than the BBC One news bulletins, with presenters appearing on-screen without jackets. Jenny Abramsky had originally planned to have a television version of the informal news radio channel BBC Radio 5 Live, or a TV version of Radio 4 News FM both of which she had run. The bright design of the set was also blamed for this \u2013 one insider reportedly described it as a \"car crash in a shower\" \u2013 and was subject to the network relaunch on 25 October 1999. The channel swapped studios with sister channel BBC World, moving to studio N8 within the newsroom, where it remained until 2008. New music and title sequences accompanied this set change, following the look of newly relaunched BBC One bulletins.\nGraphics and titles were developed by the Lambie-Nairn design agency and were gradually rolled out across the whole of BBC News, including a similar design for regional news starting with \"Newsroom South East\" and the three 'BBC Nations' \u2013 Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The similarity of main BBC News output was intended to increase the credibility of the channel as well as aiding cross-channel promotion.\nA graphics relaunch in January 2007 saw the channel updated, with redesigned headline straplines, a redesigned 'digital on-screen graphic' and repositioned clock. The clock was originally placed to the left hand side of the channel name though following complaints that this could only be viewed in widescreen, it was moved to the right in February 2007. Bulletins on BBC World News and BBC One also introduced similar graphics and title sequences on the same day.\nIn 2008, the graphics were again relaunched, using the style introduced in 2007 and a new colour scheme. The typeface of the on-screen text was changed from Helvetica to Gill Sans.\nIn 2013 the graphics were changed again, to coincide with the move to New Broadcasting House. The typeface was changed back to Helvetica.\nThese were updated again in July 2019 when the BBC redesigned its on-air look with the growth of television viewing on smartphones and tablets. These included again redesigned, larger headline straplines sharply contrasting with the background (drawing criticism for obscuring content) using the BBC Reith typeface with larger text. Despite this, the 2008 titles and music continue to be used for the updated local titles.\nThe Lambert Report.\nThe Lambert Report into the channel's performance in 2002 called upon News 24 to develop a better brand of its own, to allow viewers to differentiate between itself and similar channels such as Sky News. As a direct result of this, a brand new style across all presentation for the channel launched on 8 December 2003 at 09:00. Philip Hayton and Anna Jones were the first two presenters on the set, the relaunch of which had been put back a week due to previous power disruptions at Television Centre where the channel was based. The new designs also featured a dynamic set of titles for the channel; the globe would begin spinning from where the main story was taking place, while the headline scrolled around in a ribbon; this was occasionally replaced by the BBC News logo. The titles concluded with a red globe surrounded by a red stylised clamshell and BBC News ribbons forming above the BBC News logo.\nBulletins on BBC One moved into a new set in January 2003 although retained the previous ivory Lambie-Nairn titles until February 2004. News 24 updated the title colours slightly to match those of BBC One bulletins in time for the 50th anniversary of BBC television news on 5 July 2004.\nCountdown sequence.\nAn important part of the channel's presentation since launch has been the top of the hour countdown sequence, since there is no presentation system with continuity announcers so the countdown provides a link to the beginning of the next hour. A similar musical device is used on BBC Radio 5 Live, and mirrors the pips on BBC Radio 4.\nPrevious styles have included a series of fictional flags set to music between 1997 and 1999 before the major relaunch, incorporating the new contemporary music composed by David Lowe, and graphics developed by Lambie-Nairn. Various images, originally ivory numbers fully animated against a deep red background, were designed to fit the pace of the channel, and the music soon gained notoriety, and was often satirised and parodied in popular culture. Images of life around the UK were added in replacement later with the same music, together with footage of the newsroom and exterior of Television Centre. The 2003 relaunch saw a small change to this style with less of a metropolitan feel to the footage.\nA new sequence was introduced on 28 March 2005, designed and created by Red Bee Media and directed by Mark Chaudoir. The full version ran for 60 seconds, though only around 30 seconds were usually shown on air. The music was revised completely but the biggest change came in the footage used \u2013 reflecting the methods and nature of newsgathering, while a strong emphasis was placed on the BBC logo itself. Satellite dishes are shown transmitting and receiving red \"data streams\". In production of the countdown sequence, Clive Norman filmed images around the United Kingdom, Richard Jopson in the United States, while BBC News camerapeople filmed images from Iraq, Beijing (Tiananmen Square), Bund of Shanghai, Africa, as well as areas affected by the 2004 Asian tsunami and others.\nThe sequence has since seen several remixes to the music and a change in visuals to focus more on the well-known journalists, with less footage of camera crews and production teams. Changes have also seen the channel logo included during the sequences and at the end, as well as the fonts used for the time. The conclusion of the countdown was altered in 2008 to feature the new presentation style, rather than a data stream moving in towards the camera. Also in 2008, the graphic for the countdown changed, resembling the BBC One Rhythm and Movement idents, due to the logo being in a red square in the bottom left corner.\nTo coincide with the move of BBC News to Broadcasting House, on 18 March 2013 the countdown was updated again along with several other presentation elements. Three of the most striking features of the new countdown include music performed by the BBC Concert Orchestra, a redesign of the \"data streams\" and the ending of the sequence no longer fading to the BBC News globe and logo, but instead stopping with a time-lapse shot outside the corporation's headquarters. The countdown was also extended to 87 seconds, which was fully shown before the first hour from Broadcasting House. In 2019, the countdown started using the BBC's new Reith font but otherwise retained the same style.\nA full three-minute version of the countdown music was made available on BBC News Online and David Lowe's own website after a remix on 16May 2006.\nAn international version of the countdown was launched on BBC World News on 5 September 2005 featuring more international content and similar music. Various changes have been made to the music and visuals since then, with presentation following the style of BBC News. The visuals in the sequence were updated on 10 May 2010. In June 2011, further imagery was added relating to recent events, including the conflict in Libya and views of outside 10 Downing Street. In January 2013, as part of the relocation of BBC News to Broadcasting House in Central London, BBC World News received a new countdown in the same style as the BBC News Channel's updated countdown, with some minor differences.\nIn April 2021, a new \"sombre\" version of the countdown was played, with no \"data streams\" and slower shots of places within the UK, or in the case of the international version, timelapse shots across the world. Both were introduced to run up to programmes immediately following the death of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and were used again following the death of Queen Elizabeth II in 2022.\nTo coincide with the integration of BBC World News into BBC News, the countdown sequence was slightly refreshed in April 2023 to follow the new \"Chameleon\" branding scheme used by BBC television since October 2021, with the countdown now centred between the BBC and \"News\" wordmarks at the top- and bottom-centre of the screen respectively.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Most tetrapods have five digits (pentadactyly), and short digits (i.e. significantly shorter than the metacarpal/metatarsals) are typically referred to as toes, while those that are notably elongated are called fingers. In humans, the fingers are flexibly articulated and opposable, serving as an important organ of tactile sensation and fine movements, which are crucial to the dexterity of the hands and the ability to grasp and manipulate objects.\nHumans.\nUsually humans have five digits, the bones of which are termed phalanges, on each hand, although some people have more or fewer than five due to congenital disorders such as polydactyly or oligodactyly, or accidental or intentional amputations. The first digit is the thumb, followed by the index finger, middle finger, ring finger, and little finger or pinkie. According to different definitions, the thumb can be called a finger, or not.\nEnglish dictionaries describe finger as meaning either one of the five digits including the thumb, or one of the four digits excluding the thumb (in which case they are numbered from 1 to 4 starting with the index finger closest to the thumb).\nStructure.\nSkeleton.\nThe thumb (connected to the trapezium) is located on one of the sides, parallel to the arm.\nThe palm has five bones known as metacarpal bones, one to each of the five digits. Human hands contain fourteen digital bones, also called phalanges, or phalanx bones: two in the thumb (the thumb has no middle phalanx) and three in each of the four fingers. These are the distal phalanx, carrying the nail, the middle phalanx, and the proximal phalanx.\nJoints are formed wherever two or more of these bones meet. Each of the fingers has three joints:\nSesamoid bones are small ossified nodes embedded in the tendons to provide extra leverage and reduce pressure on the underlying tissue. Many exist around the palm at the bases of the digits; the exact number varies between different people.\nThe articulations are: interphalangeal articulations between phalangeal bones, and metacarpophalangeal joints connecting the phalanges to the metacarpal bones.\nMuscles.\nEach finger may flex and extend, abduct and adduct, and so also circumduct. Flexion is by far the strongest movement. In humans, there are two large muscles that produce flexion of each finger, and additional muscles that augment the movement. The muscle bulks that move each finger may be partly blended, and the tendons may be attached to each other by a net of fibrous tissue, preventing completely free movement. Although each finger seems to move independently, moving one finger also moves the other fingers slightly which is called finger interdependence or finger enslaving.\nFingers do not contain muscles (other than arrector pili). The muscles that move the finger joints are in the palm and forearm. The long tendons that deliver motion from the forearm muscles may be observed to move under the skin at the wrist and on the back of the hand.\nMuscles of the fingers can be subdivided into extrinsic and intrinsic muscles.\nThe extrinsic muscles are the long flexors and extensors. They are called extrinsic because the muscle belly is located on the forearm.\nThe fingers have two long flexors, located on the underside of the forearm. They insert by tendons to the phalanges of the fingers. The deep flexor attaches to the distal phalanx, and the superficial flexor attaches to the middle phalanx. The flexors allow for the actual bending of the fingers. The thumb has one long flexor and a short flexor in the thenar muscle group. The human thumb also has other muscles in the thenar group (opponens and abductor brevis muscle), moving the thumb in opposition, making grasping possible.\nThe extensors are located on the back of the forearm and are connected in a more complex way than the flexors to the dorsum of the fingers. The tendons unite with the interosseous and lumbrical muscles to form the extensorhood mechanism. The primary function of the extensors is to straighten out the digits. The thumb has two extensors in the forearm; the tendons of these form the anatomical snuff box. Also, the index finger and the little finger have an extra extensor, used for instance for pointing. The extensors are situated within six separate compartments. The first compartment contains abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis. The second compartment contains extensors carpi radialis longus and brevis. The third compartment contains extensor pollicis longus. The extensor digitorum indicis and extensor digitorum communis are within the fourth compartment. Extensor digiti minimi is in the fifth, and extensor carpi ulnaris is in the sixth.\nThe intrinsic muscle groups are the thenar and hypothenar muscles (thenar referring to the thumb, hypothenar to the small finger), the dorsal and palmar interossei muscles (between the metacarpal bones) and the lumbrical muscles. The lumbricals arise from the deep flexor (and are special because they have no bony origin) and insert on the dorsal extensor hood mechanism.\nSkin.\nAside from the genitals, the fingertips possess the highest concentration of touch receptors and thermoreceptors among all areas of the human skin, making them extremely sensitive to temperature, pressure, vibration, texture and moisture. A study in 2013 suggested fingers can feel nano-scale wrinkles on a seemingly smooth surface, a level of sensitivity not previously recorded. This makes the fingers commonly used sensory probes to ascertain properties of objects encountered in the world, making them prone to injury.\nThe \"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;pulp of a finger\" is the fleshy mass on the palmar aspect of the extremity of the finger.\nFingertip wrinkling in water.\nAlthough a common phenomenon, the underlying functions and mechanism of fingertip wrinkling following immersion in water are relatively unexplored. Originally it was assumed that the wrinkles were simply the result of the skin swelling in water, but it is now understood that the furrows are caused by the blood vessels constricting due to signalling by the sympathetic nervous system in response to water exposure. One hypothesis for why this occurs, the \"rain tread\" hypothesis, posits that the wrinkles may help the fingers grip things when wet, possibly being an adaption from a time when humans dealt with rain and dew in forested primate habitats. A 2013 study supporting this hypothesis found that the wrinkled fingertips provided better handling of wet objects but gave no advantage for handling dry objects. However, a 2014 study attempting to reproduce these results was unable to demonstrate any improvement of handling wet objects with wrinkled fingertips.\nRegrowth of the fingertips.\nFingertips, after having been torn off children, have been observed to regrow in less than 8 weeks. However, these fingertips do not look the same, although they do look more appealing than a skin graft or a sewn fingertip. No healing occurs if the tear happens below the nail. This works because the distal phalanges are regenerative in youth, and stem cells in the nails create new tissue that ends up as the fingertip.\nBrain representation.\nEach finger has an orderly somatotopic representation on the cerebral cortex in the somatosensory cortex area 3b, part of area 1 and a distributed, overlapping representations in the supplementary motor area and primary motor area.\nThe somatosensory cortex representation of the hand is a dynamic reflection of the fingers on the external hand: in syndactyly people have a clubhand of webbed, shortened fingers. However, not only are the fingers of their hands fused, but the cortical maps of their individual fingers also form a club hand. The fingers can be surgically divided to make a more useful hand. Surgeons did this at the Institute of Reconstructive Plastic Surgery in New York to a 32-year-old man with the initials O. G.. They touched O. G.'s fingers before and after surgery while using MRI brain scans. Before the surgery, the fingers mapped onto his brain were fused close together; afterward, the maps of his individual fingers did indeed separate and take the layout corresponding to a normal hand.\nClinical significance.\nAnomalies, injuries and diseases.\nA rare anatomical variation affects 1 in 500 humans, in which the individual has more than the usual number of digits; this is known as polydactyly. A human may also be born without one or more fingers or underdevelopment of some fingers such as symbrachydactyly. Extra fingers can be functional. One individual with seven fingers not only used them but claimed that they \"gave him some advantages in playing the piano\".\nPhalanges are commonly fractured. A damaged tendon can cause significant loss of function in fine motor control, such as with a mallet finger. They can be damaged by cold, including frostbite and non-freezing cold injury (NFCI); and heat, including burns.\nThe fingers are commonly affected by diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and gout. Individuals with diabetes often use the fingers to obtain blood samples for regular blood sugar testing. Raynaud's phenomenon and Paroxysmal hand hematoma are neurovascular disorders that affect the fingers.\nResearch has linked the ratio of lengths between the index and ring fingers to higher levels of testosterone, and to various physical and behavioral traits such as penis length and risk for development of alcohol dependence or video game addiction.\nLand vertebrates.\nAs terrestrial vertebrates were evolved from lobe-finned fish, their forelimbs are phylogenetically equivalent to the pectoral fins of fish. Within the taxa of the terrestrial vertebrates, the basic pentadactyl plan, and thus also the metacarpals and phalanges, undergo many variations.\nMorphologically the different fingers of terrestrial vertebrates are homolog. The wings of birds and those of bats are not homologous, they are analogue flight organs. However, the phalanges within them are homologous.\nChimpanzees have lower limbs that are specialized for manipulation, and (arguably) have fingers (instead of toes) on their lower limbs as well. In the case of primates in general, the digits of the hand are overwhelmingly referred to as \"fingers\". Primate fingers have both fingernails and fingerprints.\nResearch has been carried out on the embryonic development of domestic chickens showing that an interdigital webbing forms between the tissues that become the toes, which subsequently regresses by apoptosis. If apoptosis fails to occur, the interdigital skin remains intact. Many animals have developed webbed feet or skin between the fingers from this like the Wallace's flying frog.\nEtymology.\nThe English word \"finger\" stems from Old English \"finger\", ultimately from Proto-Germanic ' ('finger'). It is cognate with Old Norse ', or Old High German '. Linguists generally assume that ' is a \"ro\"-stem deriving from a previous form ', ultimately from Proto-Indo-European ' ('five').\nThe name pinkie derives from Dutch , of uncertain origin. In English only the digits on the hand are known as fingers. However, in some languages the translated version of fingers can mean either the digits on the hand or feet. In English a digit on a foot has the distinct name of toe.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "37622", "revid": "14457240", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37622", "title": "Venus (mythology)", "text": "Ancient Roman goddess of love, sex and fertility\nVenus (; ) is a Roman goddess whose functions encompass love, beauty, desire, sex, fertility, prosperity, and victory. In Roman mythology, she was the ancestor of the Roman people through her son, Aeneas, who survived the fall of Troy and fled to Italy. Julius Caesar claimed her as his ancestor. Venus was central to many religious festivals, and was revered in Roman religion under numerous cult titles.\nThe Romans adapted the myths and iconography of her Greek counterpart Aphrodite for Roman art and Latin literature. In the later classical tradition of the West, Venus became one of the most widely referenced deities of Greco-Roman mythology as the embodiment of love and sexuality. As such, she is usually depicted nude.\nEtymology.\nThe Latin theonym and the common noun ('love, charm') stem from a Proto-Italic form reconstructed as ('desire'), itself from Proto-Indo-European (PIE) ('desire'; cf. Messapic ', Old Indic 'desire'). Unlike the Proto-Indo-European form, which would have been a neuter s-stem, the Latin term has acquired the feminine gender, perhaps as a consequence of its relation to a female deity. The cognates of her name generally do not refer to goddesses in other Indo-European cultures, perhaps indicating that the term was innovatively applied to a specifically Italic divinity. Messapic does, however, appear to the refer to a divinity, though it is likely that this term was borrowed from an Italic source. Similarly, the name of the goddess is attested in Oscan ' (), which may also have been borrowed from Latin.\nDerivatives include ('attractive, charming'), ('charm, grace'), ('of Venus, erotic'), ('to adore, revere, honor, venerate, worship'), and ('adoration'). \"Venus\" is also cognate with Latin ('favour, permission') and ('to hunt') through to common PIE root ('to strive for, wish for, desire, love'). \nOrigins.\nVenus has been described as perhaps \"the most original creation of the Roman pantheon\",146 and \"an ill-defined and assimilative\" native goddess, combined \"with a strange and exotic Aphrodite\". In the sanctuary of Mefitis at Rossano di Vaglio, the name Venus is mentioned with an accompanying epithet referring to the deity Mefitis. Her cults may represent the religiously legitimate charm and seduction of the divine by mortals, in contrast to the formal, contractual relations between most members of Rome's official pantheon and the state, and the unofficial, illicit manipulation of divine forces through magic. The ambivalence of her persuasive functions has been perceived in the relationship of the root with its Latin derivative ('poison'; from \"*wenes-no\" 'love drink' or 'addicting'), in the sense of \"a charm, magic philtre\".\nVenus seems to have had no origin myth until her association with Greek Aphrodite. Venus-Aphrodite emerged, already in adult form, from the sea foam (Greek , ) produced by the severed genitals of Caelus-Uranus. Roman theology presents Venus as the yielding, watery female principle, essential to the generation and balance of life. Her male counterparts in the Roman pantheon, Vulcan and Mars, are active and fiery. Venus absorbs and tempers the male essence, uniting the opposites of male and female in mutual affection. She is essentially assimilative and benign, and embraces several otherwise quite disparate functions. She can give military victory, sexual success, good fortune and prosperity. In one context, she is a goddess of prostitutes; in another, she turns the hearts of men and women from sexual vice to virtue. Varro's theology identifies Venus with water as an aspect of the female principle. To generate life, the watery matrix of the womb requires the virile warmth of fire. To sustain life, water and fire must be balanced; excess of either one, or their mutual antagonism, is unproductive or destructive.\nProspective brides offered Venus a gift \"before the wedding\"; the nature of the gift, and its timing, are unknown. The wedding ceremony itself, and the state of lawful marriage, belonged to Juno \u2013 whose mythology allows her only a single marriage, and no divorce from her habitually errant spouse, Jupiter \u2013 but Venus and Juno are also likely \"bookends\" for the ceremony; Venus prepares the bride for \"conubial bliss\" and expectations of fertility within lawful marriage. Some Roman sources say that girls who come of age offer their toys to Venus; it is unclear where the offering is made, and others say this gift is to the Lares. In dice-games played with knucklebones, a popular pastime among Romans of all classes, the luckiest, best possible roll was known as \"Venus\".\nEpithets.\nLike other major Roman deities, Venus was given a number of epithets that referred to her different cult aspects, roles, and her functional similarities to other deities. Her \"original powers seem to have been extended largely by the fondness of the Romans for folk-etymology, and by the prevalence of the religious idea \"nomen-omen\" which sanctioned any identifications made in this way.\"457\nVenus Acidalia, in Virgil's \"Aeneid\" (1.715\u201322, as \"mater acidalia\"). Servius speculates this \"rare\" and \"strangely recondite epithet\" as reference to a mooted \"Fountain of Acidalia\" (\"fons acidalia\") where the Graces (Venus's daughters) were said to bathe; but he also connects it to the Greek word for \"dart\", \"needle\", \"arrow\", whence \"love's arrows\" and love's bitter \"cares and pangs\". Ovid uses \"acidalia\" only in the latter sense. \"Venus Acidalia\" is likely a literary conceit, formed by Virgil from earlier usages in which \"acidalia\" had no evident connection to Venus. It was almost certainly not a cultic epithet.\nVenus Anadyomene (Venus \"rising from the sea\"), based on a once-famous painting by the Greek artist Apelles showing the birth of Aphrodite from sea-foam, fully adult and supported by a more-than-lifesized scallop shell. The Italian Renaissance painter Sandro Botticelli used the type in his The Birth of Venus. Other versions of Venus's birth show her standing on land or shoreline, wringing the sea-water from her hair. \nVenus Barbata (\"Bearded Venus\"), mentioned in Servius's commentary on Virgil's \"Aeneid\". Macrobius's Saturnalia describes a statue of Venus in Cyprus, bearded, with male genitalia but in female attire and figure (see also Aphroditus). Her worshippers cross-dressed - men wore women's clothes, and women wore men's. Macrobius says that Aristophanes called this figure \"Aphroditos\". The Latin poet Laevius wrote of worshipping \"nurturing Venus\" whether female or male \"(sive femina sive mas)\". Several examples of Greek and Roman sculpture show her in the attitude \"anasyrmene\", from the Greek verb \"anasyromai\", \"to pull up one's clothes\" to reveal her male genitalia. The gesture traditionally held apotropaic or magical power.\nVenus Caelestis (Celestial or Heavenly Venus), used from the 2nd\u00a0century AD for Venus as an aspect of a syncretised supreme goddess. \"Venus Caelestis\" is the earliest known Roman recipient of a taurobolium (a form of bull sacrifice), performed at her shrine in Pozzuoli on 5\u00a0October 134. This form of the goddess, and the taurobolium, are associated with the \"Syrian Goddess\", understood as a late equivalent to Astarte, or the Roman Magna Mater, the latter being another supposedly Trojan \"Mother of the Romans\", as well as \"Mother of the Gods\".\nVenus Calva (\"Venus the bald one\"), a legendary form of Venus, attested only by post-Classical Roman writings which offer several traditions to explain this appearance and epithet. In one, it commemorates the virtuous offer by Roman matrons of their own hair to make bowstrings during a siege of Rome. In another, king Ancus Marcius's wife and other Roman women lost their hair during an epidemic; in hope of its restoration, unafflicted women sacrificed their own hair to Venus.\n \nVenus Cloacina (\"Venus the Purifier\"); a fusion of Venus with the Etruscan water goddess Cloacina, who had an ancient shrine above the outfall of the Cloaca Maxima, originally a stream, later covered over to function as Rome's main sewer. The rites conducted at the shrine were probably meant to purify the culvert's polluted waters and noxious airs. In some traditions, Titus Tatius was responsible for the introduction of lawful marriage to Rome, and Venus-Cloacina promoted, protected and purified sexual intercourse between married couples.\nVenus Erycina (\"Erycine Venus\"), a Punic statue of Astarte captured from Eryx, in Sicily, and worshiped in Romanised form by the elite and respectable matrons at a temple on the Capitoline Hill. A later temple, outside the Porta Collina and Rome's sacred boundary, may have preserved some Erycine features of her cult. It was considered suitable for \"common girls\" and prostitutes.\nVenus Euploia (Venus of the \"fair voyage\"), also known as Venus Pontia (Venus of the Sea\"), because she smooths the waves for mariners. She is probably based on the influential image of Aphrodite by Praxiteles, once housed in a temple by the sea but now lost. Most copies of its Venus image would have been supported by dolphins, and worn diadems and carved veils, inferring her birth from sea-foam, and a consequent identity as Queen of the Sea, and patroness of sailors and navigation. Roman copies would have embellished baths and gymnasiums. \nVenus Frutis honoured by all the Latins with a federal cult at the temple named \"Frutinal\" in Lavinium. Inscriptions found at Lavinium attest the presence of federal cults, without giving precise details.\nVenus Felix (\"Lucky Venus\"), probably a traditional epithet, combining aspects of Venus and Fortuna, goddess of both good and bad fortune and personification of luck, whose iconography includes the rudder of a ship, found in some Pompeian examples of the regal \"Venus Physica\". A form of Venus usually identified as Venus Felix was adopted by the dictator Sulla to legitimise his victories over his domestic and foreign opponents during Rome's late Republican civil and foreign wars; Rives finds it very unlikely that Sulla would have imposed this humiliating connection on unwilling or conquered domestic territories once allied to Samnium, such as Pompei.\nThe emperor Hadrian built a temple to \"Venus Felix et Roma Aeterna\" on the Via Sacra. The same epithet is used for a specific sculpture at the Vatican Museums.\nVenus Genetrix (\"Venus the Mother\"), as a goddess of motherhood and domesticity, with a festival on September 26, a personal ancestress of the Julian lineage and, more broadly, the divine ancestress of the Roman people. Julius Caesar dedicated a Temple of Venus Genetrix in 46 BC. This name has attached to an iconological type of statue of Aphrodite/Venus.\nVenus Heliopolitana (\"Venus of Heliopolis Syriaca\"), a Romano-Syrian form of Venus at Baalbek, variously identified with Ashtart, Dea Syria and Atargatis, though inconsistently and often on very slender grounds. She has been historically identified as one third of a so-called Heliopolitan Triad, and thus a wife to presumed sun-god \"Syrian Jupiter\" (Baal) and mother of \"Syrian Mercury\" (Adon). The \"Syrian Mercury\" is sometimes thought as another sun-god, or a syncretised form of Bacchus as a \"dying and rising\" god, and thus a god of Springtime. No such Triad seems to have existed prior to Baalbek's 15 BC colonisation by Augustus's veterans. It may be a modern scholarly artifice.\nVenus Kallipygos (\"Venus with the beautiful buttocks\"), a statue, and possibly a statue type, after a lost Greek original. From Syracuse, Sicily.\nVenus Libertina (\"Venus the Freedwoman\"), probably arising through the semantic similarity and cultural links between \"libertina\" (as \"a free woman\") and \"lubentina\" (possibly meaning \"pleasurable\" or \"passionate\"). Further titles or variants acquired by Venus through the same process, or through orthographic variance, include Libentia, Lubentina, and Lubentini. Venus Libitina links Venus to a patron-goddess of funerals and undertakers, Libitina, who also became synonymous with death; a temple was dedicated to Venus Libitina in Libitina's grove on the Esquiline Hill, \"hardly later than 300 BC\".\nVenus Murcia (\"Venus of the Myrtle\"), merging Venus with the little-known deity Murcia (or Murcus, or Murtia). Murcia was associated with Rome's Mons Murcia (the Aventine's lesser height), and had a shrine in the Circus Maximus. Some sources associate her with the myrtle-tree. Christian writers described her as a goddess of sloth and laziness.\nVenus Obsequens (\"Indulgent Venus\"), Venus's first attested Roman epithet. It was used in the dedication of her first Roman temple, on August 19 in 295 BC during the Third Samnite War by Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges. It was sited somewhere near the Aventine Hill and Circus Maximus, and played a central role in the Vinalia Rustica. It was supposedly funded by fines imposed on women found guilty of adultery.89\nVenus Physica, Venus as a universal, natural creative force that informs the physical world. She is addressed as \"Alma Venus\" (\"Mother Venus\") by Lucretius in the introductory lines of his vivid, poetic exposition of Epicurean physics and philosophy, \"De Rerum Natura\". She seems to have been a favourite of Lucretius's patron, Memmius. \nVenus Physica Pompeiana was Pompeii's protective goddess, antedating Sulla's imposition of a colonia named \"Colonia Veneria Cornelia\" after his family and Venus, following his siege and capture of Pompeii from the Samnites. Venus also had a distinctive, local form as Venus Pescatrice (\"Venus the Fisher-woman\") a goddess of the sea, and trade. For Sulla's claims of Venus's favour, see \"Venus Felix\" above). Pompeii's Temple of Venus was built sometime in the 1st century BC, before Sulla's colonisation. This local form of Venus had Roman, Oscan and local Pompeiian influences. Like \"Venus Physica\", \"Venus Physica Pompeiana\" is also a regal form of \"Nature Mother\" and a guarantor of success in love.\nVenus Urania (\"Heavenly Venus\"), used as the title of a book by Basilius von Ramdohr, a relief by Pompeo Marchesi, and a painting by Christian Griepenkerl. (cf. Aphrodite Urania)\nVenus Verticordia (\"Venus the Changer of Hearts\"), celebrated at the Veneralia for her ability to transform untethered desire (\"libido)\" into \"pudicitia\", sexuality expressed within socially permitted bounds, hence marriage. \nVenus Victrix (\"Venus the Victorious\"), a Romanised aspect of the armed Aphrodite that Greeks had inherited from the East, where the goddess Ishtar \"remained a goddess of war, and Venus could bring victory to a Sulla or a Caesar\". Pompey vied with his patron Sulla and with Caesar for public recognition as her prot\u00e9g\u00e9. In 55 BC he dedicated a temple to her at the top of his theater in the Campus Martius. She had a shrine on the Capitoline Hill, and festivals on August 12 and October 9. A sacrifice was annually dedicated to her on the latter date. In neo-classical art, her epithet as Victrix is often used in the sense of 'Venus Victorious over men's hearts' or in the context of the Judgement of Paris (e.g. Canova's \"Venus Victrix\", a half-nude reclining portrait of Pauline Bonaparte).\nCult history and temples.\nThe first known temple to Venus was vowed to \"Venus Obsequens\" by Q. Fabius Gurges in the heat of a battle against the Samnites. It was dedicated in 295 BC, at a site near the Aventine Hill, and was supposedly funded by fines imposed on Roman women for sexual misdemeanours. Its rites and character were probably influenced by or based on Greek Aphrodite's cults, which were already diffused in various forms throughout Italian Magna Graeca. Its dedication date connects \"Venus Obsequens\" to the \"Vinalia rustica\" festival.456\nIn 217 BC, in the early stages of the Second Punic War with Carthage, Rome suffered a disastrous defeat at the battle of Lake Trasimene. The Sibylline oracle suggested that Carthage might be defeated if the Venus of Eryx (), patroness goddess of Carthage's Sicilian allies, could be persuaded to change her allegiance. Rome laid siege to Eryx and promised its goddess a magnificent temple as reward for her defection. They captured her image, brought it to Rome and installed it in a temple on the Capitoline Hill, as one of Rome's twelve \". Shorn of her more overtly Carthaginian characteristics, this \"foreign Venus\" became Rome's \"Venus Genetrix\" (\"Venus the Mother\"), Roman tradition made Venus the mother and protector of the Trojan prince Aeneas, ancestor of the Romans, so as far as the Romans were concerned, this was the homecoming of an ancestral goddess to her people. Soon after, Rome's defeat of Carthage confirmed Venus's goodwill to Rome, her links to its mythical Trojan past, and her support of its political and military hegemony.\nThe Capitoline cult to Venus seems to have been reserved to higher status Romans. A separate cult to \"Venus Erycina\" as a fertility deity, was established in 181 BC, in a traditionally plebeian district just outside Rome's sacred boundary, near the Colline Gate. The temple, cult and goddess probably retained much of the original's character and rites. Likewise, a shrine to Venus Verticordia (\"Venus the changer of hearts\"), established in 114 BC but with links to an ancient cult of Venus-Fortuna, was \"bound to the peculiar milieu of the Aventine and the Circus Maximus\" \u2013 a strongly plebeian context for Venus's cult, in contrast to her aristocratic cultivation as a Stoic and Epicurian \"all-goddess\".\nTowards the end of the Roman Republic, some leading Romans laid personal claims to Venus's favour. The general and dictator Sulla adopted \"Felix\" (\"Lucky\") as a surname, acknowledging his debt to heaven-sent good fortune and his particular debt to \"Venus Felix\", for his extraordinarily fortunate political and military career. His prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Pompey competed for Venus's support, dedicating (in 55 BC) a large temple to \"Venus Victrix\" as part of his lavishly appointed new theatre, and celebrating his triumph of 54 BC with coins that showed her crowned with triumphal laurels.\nPompey's erstwhile friend, ally, and later opponent Julius Caesar went still further. He claimed the favours of \"Venus Victrix\" in his military success and \"Venus Genetrix\" as a personal, divine ancestress \u2013 apparently a long-standing family tradition among the Julii. When Caesar was assassinated, his heir, Augustus, adopted both claims as evidence of his inherent fitness for office, and divine approval of his rule. Augustus's new temple to Mars Ultor, divine father of Rome's legendary founder Romulus, would have underlined the point, with the image of avenging Mars \"almost certainly\" accompanied by that of his divine consort Venus, and possibly a statue of the deceased and deified Caesar.\nVitruvius recommends that any new temple to Venus be sited according to rules laid down by the Etruscan haruspices, and built \"near to the gate\" of the city, where it would be less likely to contaminate \"the matrons and youth with the influence of lust\". He finds the Corinthian style, slender, elegant, enriched with ornamental leaves and surmounted by volutes, appropriate to Venus's character and disposition. Vitruvius recommends the widest possible spacing between the temple columns, producing a light and airy space, and he offers Venus's temple in Caesar's forum as an example of how not to do it; the densely spaced, thickset columns darken the interior, hide the temple doors and crowd the walkways, so that matrons who wish to honour the goddess must enter her temple in single file, rather than arm-in arm.\nIn 135 AD the Emperor Hadrian inaugurated a temple to Venus and \"Roma Aeterna\" (Eternal Rome) on Rome's Velian Hill, underlining the Imperial unity of Rome and its provinces, and making Venus the protective \"genetrix\" of the entire Roman state, its people and fortunes. It was the largest temple in Ancient Rome.\nFestivals.\nVenus was offered official (state-sponsored) cult in certain festivals of the Roman calendar. Her sacred month was April (Latin \"Mensis Aprilis\") which Roman etymologists understood to derive from \"aperire\", \"to open\", with reference to the springtime blossoming of trees and flowers. In the of the Germanic pantheon during the early centuries AD, Venus became identified with the Germanic goddess \"Frijjo\", giving rise to the loan translation \"Friday\" for \"dies Veneris\".\nVeneralia (April 1) was held in honour of Venus Verticordia (\"Venus the Changer of Hearts\"), and Fortuna Virilis (Virile or strong Good Fortune)), whose cult was probably by far the older of the two. Venus Verticordia was invented in 220 BC, in response to advice from a Sibylline oracle during Rome's Punic Wars, when a series of prodigies was taken to signify divine displeasure at sexual offenses among Romans of every category and class, including several men and three Vestal Virgins. The statue of Venus Verticordia was dedicated by a young woman, chosen as the most \"pudica\" (sexually pure) in Rome by a committee of Roman matrons. At first, this statue was probably housed in the temple of \"Fortuna Virilis\", perhaps as divine reinforcement against the perceived moral and religious failings of its cult. In 114 BC \"Venus Verticordia\" was given her own temple. She was meant to persuade Romans of both sexes and every class, whether married or unmarried, to cherish the traditional sexual proprieties and morality known to please the gods and benefit the State. During her rites, her image was taken from her temple to the men's baths, where it was undressed and washed in warm water by her female attendants, then garlanded with myrtle. Women and men asked Venus Verticordia's help in affairs of the heart, sex, betrothal and marriage. For Ovid, Venus's acceptance of the epithet and its attendant responsibilities represented a change of heart in the goddess herself.\nVinalia urbana (April 23), a wine festival shared by Venus and Jupiter, king of the gods. It offered opportunity to supplicants to ask Venus's intercession with Jupiter, who was thought to be susceptible to her charms, and amenable to the effects of her wine. Venus was patroness of \"profane\" wine, for everyday human use. Jupiter was patron of the strongest, purest, sacrificial grade wine, and controlled the weather on which the autumn grape-harvest would depend. At this festival, men and women alike drank the new vintage of ordinary, non-sacral wine (pressed at the previous year's \"vinalia rustica\") in honour of Venus, whose powers had provided humankind with this gift. Upper-class women gathered at Venus's Capitoline temple, where a libation of the previous year's vintage, sacred to Jupiter, was poured into a nearby ditch. Common girls (\"vulgares puellae\") and prostitutes gathered at Venus's temple just outside the Colline gate, where they offered her myrtle, mint, and rushes concealed in rose-bunches and asked her for \"beauty and popular favour\", and to be made \"charming and witty\".\nVinalia Rustica (August 19), originally a rustic Latin festival of wine, vegetable growth and fertility. This was almost certainly Venus's oldest festival and was associated with her earliest known form, \"Venus Obsequens\". Kitchen gardens and market-gardens, and presumably vineyards were dedicated to her. Roman opinions differed on whose festival it was. Varro insists that the day was sacred to Jupiter, whose control of the weather governed the ripening of the grapes; but the sacrificial victim, a female lamb (\"agna\"), may be evidence that it once belonged to Venus alone.\nA festival of Venus Genetrix (September 26) was held under state auspices from 46 BC at her Temple in the Forum of Caesar, in fulfillment of a vow by Julius Caesar, who claimed her personal favour as his divine patroness, and ancestral goddess of the Julian clan. Caesar dedicated the temple during his extraordinarily lavish quadruple triumph. At the same time, he was pontifex maximus and Rome's senior magistrate; the festival is thought to mark the unprecedented promotion of a personal, family cult to one of the Roman state. Caesar's heir, Augustus, made much of these personal and family associations with Venus as an Imperial deity. The festival's rites are not known.\nMythology and literature.\nAs with most major gods and goddesses in Roman mythology, the literary concept of Venus is mantled in whole-cloth borrowings from the literary Greek mythology of her counterpart, Aphrodite, but with significant exceptions. In some Latin mythology, Cupid was the son of Venus and Mars, the god of war. At other times, or in parallel myths and theologies, Venus was understood to be the consort of Vulcan or as mother of the \"second cupid\", fathered by Mercury. Virgil, in compliment to his patron Augustus and the \"gens Julia\", embellished an existing connection between Venus, whom Julius Caesar had adopted as his protectress, and the Trojan prince Aeneas, refugee from Troy's destruction and eventual ancestor of the Roman people. Virgil's Aeneas is guided to Latium by Venus in her heavenly form, the morning star, shining brightly before him in the daylight sky; much later, she lifts Caesar's soul to heaven. In Ovid's \"Fasti\" Venus came to Rome because she \"preferred to be worshipped in the city of her own offspring\". In Virgil's poetic account of Octavian's victory at the sea-battle of Actium, the future emperor is allied with Venus, Neptune and Minerva. Octavian's opponents, Antony, Cleopatra and the Egyptians, assisted by bizarre and unhelpful Egyptian deities such as \"barking\" Anubis, lose the battle.\nThe Cupids.\nCupid (lust or desire) and Amor (affectionate love) are taken to be different names for the same Roman love-god, the son of Venus, fathered by Mercury, Vulcan or Mars. Childlike or boyish winged figures who accompany Venus, whether singly, in pairs or more, have been variously identified as Amores, Cupids, Erotes or forms of Greek Eros. The most ancient of these is Eros, whom Hesiod categorises as a primordial deity, emerging from Chaos as a generative power with neither mother nor father. Eros was the patron deity of Thespiae, where he was embodied as an aniconic stone as late as the 2nd century AD. From at least the 5th century BC he also had the form of an adolescent or pre-adolescent male, at Elis (on the Peloponnese) and elsewhere in Greece, acquiring wings, bow and arrows, and divine parents in the love-goddess Aphrodite and the war-god Ares. He had temples of his own, and shared others with Aphrodite.\nAt Elis, and in Athens, Eros shared cult with a twin, named Anteros. Xenophon's Socratic \"Symposion\" 8. 1, features a dinner-guest with \"eros\" (love) for his wife; in return, she has \"anteros\" (reciprocal love) for him. Some sources suggest Anteros as avenger of \"slighted love\". In Servius's 4th century commentary on Virgil's Aeneas, Cupid is a deceptive agent of Venus, impersonating Aeneas's son and making Dido, queen of Carthage, forget her husband. When Aeneas rejects her love, and covertly leaves Carthage to fulfill his destiny as ancestor of the Roman people, Dido is said to invoke Anteros as \"contrary to Cupid\". She falls into hatred and despair, curses Rome, and when Aeneas leaves, commits suicide. \nOvid's Fasti, Book 4, invokes Venus not by name but as \"Mother of the Twin Loves\", the \"gemini amores\". \"Amor\" is the Latin name preferred by Roman poets and \"literati\" for the personification of \"kindly\" love. Where Cupid (lust) can be imperious, cruel, prone to mischief or even war-like, Amor softly persuades. Cato the Elder, having a Stoic's outlook, sees Cupid as a deity of greed and blind passion, morally inferior to Amor. The Roman playwright Plautus, however, has Venus, Cupid and Amor working together.\nIn Roman cult inscriptions and theology, \"Amor\" is rare, and \"Cupido\" relatively common. No Roman temples seem dedicated to Cupid alone but the joint dedication formula \"Venus Cupidoque\" (\"Venus and Cupid\") is evidence of his cult, shared with Venus at her Temple just outside the Colline Gate and elsewhere. He would also have featured in many private household cults. In private and public areas alike, statues of Venus and Mars attended by Cupid, or Venus, Cupid and minor \"erotes\" were sometimes donated by wealthy sponsors, to serve both religious and artistic purposes. Cupid's roles in literary myth are usually limited to actions on behalf of Venus; in Cupid and Psyche, one of the stories within \"The Golden Ass\", by the Roman author Apuleius, the plot and its resolution are driven by Cupid's love for Psyche (\"soul\"), his filial disobedience, and his mother's envy.\nIconography.\nSigns, context and symbols.\nImages of Venus have been found in domestic murals, mosaics and household shrines (\"lararia\"). Petronius, in his \"Satyricon\", places an image of Venus among the Lares (household gods) of the freedman Trimalchio's \"lararium\". \nThe Venus types known as \"Venus Pompeiana\" (\"Venus of Pompeii\") and \"Venus Pescatrice\" (\"Venus the Fisher-woman\") are almost exclusive to Pompeii. Both forms of Venus are represented within Pompeian homes of the well-off, with \"Venus Pompeiana\" more commonly found in formal reception spaces, typically depicted in full regalia, draped with a mantle, standing rigidly upright with her right arm across her chest. Images of \"Venus Pescatrice\" tend to be more playful, usually found in less formal and less public \"non-reception\" areas: here, she usually holds a fishing rod, and sits amidst landscape scenery, accompanied by at least one cupid.\nVenus's signs are for the most part the same as Aphrodite's. They include roses, which were offered in Venus's Porta Collina rites, and above all, myrtle (Latin \"myrtus\"), which was cultivated for its white, sweetly scented flowers, aromatic, evergreen leaves and its various medical-magical properties. Venus's statues, and her worshipers, wore myrtle crowns at her festivals. Before its adoption into Venus's cults, myrtle was used in the purification rites of Cloacina, the Etruscan-Roman goddess of Rome's main sewer; later, Cloacina's association with Venus's sacred plant made her Venus Cloacina. Likewise, Roman folk-etymology transformed the ancient, obscure goddess Murcia into \"Venus of the Myrtles, whom we now call Murcia\".\nMyrtle was thought a particularly potent aphrodisiac. As goddess of love and sex, Venus played an essential role at Roman prenuptial rites and wedding nights, so myrtle and roses were used in bridal bouquets. Marriage itself was not a seduction but a lawful condition, under Juno's authority; so myrtle was excluded from the bridal crown. Venus was also a patroness of the ordinary, everyday wine drunk by most Roman men and women; the seductive powers of wine were well known. In the rites to Bona Dea, a goddess of female chastity, Venus, myrtle and anything male were not only excluded, but unmentionable. The rites allowed women to drink the strongest, sacrificial wine, otherwise reserved for the Roman gods and Roman men; the women euphemistically referred to it as \"honey\". Under these special circumstances, they could get virtuously, religiously drunk on strong wine, safe from male intrusion and Venus's temptations. Outside of this context, ordinary wine (that is, Venus's wine) tinctured with myrtle oil was thought particularly suitable for women.\nVenus's long association with wine reflects the inevitable connections between wine, intoxication and sex, expressed in the proverbial phrase (loosely translated as \"without food and wine, Venus freezes\"). It was used in various forms, notably by the Roman playwright, Terence, probably by others before him, and certainly into the early modern era. Although Venus played a central role in several wine festivals, the Roman god of wine was Bacchus, identified with Greek Dionysus and the early Roman wine-god Liber Pater (Father of Freedom).\nRoman generals given an ovation, a lesser form of Roman triumph, wore a myrtle crown, perhaps to purify themselves and their armies of blood-guilt. The ovation ceremony was assimilated to Venus Victrix (\"Victorious Venus\"), who was held to have granted and purified its relatively \"easy\" victory.\nClassical art.\nRoman and Hellenistic art produced many variations on the goddess, often based on the Praxitlean type Aphrodite of Cnidus. Many female nudes from this period of sculpture whose subjects are unknown are in modern art history conventionally called \"Venus\", even if they originally may have portrayed a mortal woman rather than operated as a cult statue of the goddess.\nExamples include:\n* Capitoline Venus\n* Venus de' Medici\nPost-classical culture.\nMedieval art.\nVenus is remembered in \"De Mulieribus Claris\", a collection of biographies of historical and mythological women by the Florentine author Giovanni Boccaccio, composed in 1361\u201362. It is notable as the first collection devoted exclusively to biographies of women in Western literature.\nArt in the classical tradition.\nVenus became a popular subject of painting and sculpture during the Renaissance period in Europe. As a \"classical\" figure for whom nudity was her natural state, it was socially acceptable to depict her unclothed. As the goddess of sexuality, a degree of erotic beauty in her presentation was justified, which appealed to many artists and their patrons. Over time, \"venus\" came to refer to any artistic depiction in post-classical art of a nude woman, even when there was no indication that the subject was the goddess.\nIn the field of prehistoric art, since the discovery in 1908 of the so-called \"Venus of Willendorf\" small Neolithic sculptures of rounded female forms have been conventionally referred to as Venus figurines. Although the name of the actual deity is not known, the knowing contrast between the obese and fertile cult figures and the classical conception of Venus has raised resistance to the terminology.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She was billed in some English-language films as Hildegard Neff or Hildegarde Neff.\nEarly years.\nHildegard Knef was born in Ulm in 1925. Her parents were Hans Theodor and Friede Augustine Knef. Her father, a decorated First World War veteran, died when she was only six months old, and her mother moved to Berlin and worked in a factory. Knef began studying acting at age 14 in 1940. She left school at 15 to become an apprentice animator with Universum Film AG. After she had a successful screen test, she went to the State Film School at Babelsberg, Berlin, where she studied acting, ballet, and elocution. Joseph Goebbels, who was Hitler's propaganda minister, wrote to her and asked to meet her, but Knef's friends wanted her to stay away from him.\nGerman film career.\nWhen the film \"Tr\u00e4umerei\" was made in 1944, Knef shot some scenes, which would have marked her film debut, but these were left out of the final cut. She did appear in several films before the fall of Nazi Germany, but most were released only afterward. \nDuring the Battle of Berlin she dressed as a soldier to stay with her lover, Ewald von Demandowsky, and joined him in the defence of Schmargendorf. The Soviets captured her and sent her to a prison camp. Her fellow prisoners helped her escape and return to Berlin. Von Demandowsky was executed by the Russians on 7 October 1946, but before that he secured for Knef the protection of the well-known character actor Viktor de Kowa in Berlin. De Kowa gave her the opportunity to be a mistress of ceremonies in the theatre that he had opened. Knef also got a part in Marcel Pagnol's \"Marius\", which was directed by Boleslaw Barlog. De Kowa also directed Knef in other plays by Shakespeare, Pagnol, and George Abbott.\nHer two best-known film roles were Susanne Wallner in Wolfgang Staudte's film \"Die M\u00f6rder sind unter uns\" (\"The Murderers Are Among Us\"), produced in 1946 by the East German state film company and the first film released after the Second World War in East Germany; and Marina in \"Die S\u00fcnderin\" (\"The Sinner\"), in which she performed a brief nude scene, the first in German film history, which caused a scandal in 1951. The film was also criticised by the Catholic Church, which protested against the nude scene. Knef stated that she didn't understand the tumult that the film was creating. She wrote that it was totally absurd that people considered her nudity to be scandalous, as Germany was the country that had created Auschwitz and had caused so much horror. She also wrote, \"I had the scandal, the producers got the money.\"\nIn 1948 she received the best-actress award from the Locarno Film Festival because of her role in the film \"Film Without a Title\". Her singing career started in the 1960s once her film career was not going very well. She performed in television shows such as episodes of \"Scarecrow and Mrs King\" and a 2000 documentary in which she was playing by herself \"Marlene Dietrich: Her Own Song\".\nIn the 1960s she appeared in a number of low-budget films, including \"The Lost Continent\".\nShe appeared in the 1975 screen adaptation of the Hans Fallada novel \"Every Man Dies Alone\" directed by Alfred Vohrer, released in English as \"Everyone Dies Alone\" in 1976, and for which she won an award for best actress at the International Film Festival in Karlovy Vary, then Czechoslovakia.\nDuring her career she performed in more than 50 films. Nineteen of her films were produced in countries other than Germany: the United States, United Kingdom, France, Italy, Austria and Spain.\nCareer in the United States.\nDavid O. Selznick invited her to Hollywood, but she refused to agree to the conditions of the contract which reportedly included changing her name to Gilda Christian and pretending to be Austrian rather than German. Knef was cast as Hilde in the Hollywood film \"Decision Before Dawn\" (1951), directed by Anatole Litvak and co-starring with Richard Basehart and Oskar Werner in a story about the later part of World War II.\nThe following year Knef's first husband, an American named Kurt Hirsch, encouraged her to try again for success in the U.S. She changed her name from Knef to Neff, but was offered only a supporting role in \"The Snows of Kilimanjaro\" (1952), an adaptation of an Ernest Hemingway short story.\nHer reputation in the U.S. was hurt because of her nude scenes in the German film \"Die S\u00fcnderin\" (1951) and because she fell in love with a Nazi when she was 19.\nFinally, in 1955, Knef was offered a starring role in the Broadway musical \"Silk Stockings\" by Cole Porter, which was based on the 1939 film \"Ninotchka\", which had starred Greta Garbo in the title role. Knef had acted in at least 30 films in the United States and Europe but her triumph came in New York when she played Ninotchka, an unemotional Soviet commissar. \"The New York Times\" drama critic Brooks Atkinson described her rendition as \"an immensely skillful performance.\"\nSinger.\nIn the 1960s Knef took a break from acting and started writing song lyrics. In 1963 she started a concert and recording career, and she surprised her audiences with the deep, smoky quality of her voice and with lyrics she wrote herself. Fans around the world rallied in her support as she recovered from cancer several times. She returned to Berlin after Reunification. At her peak, an entertainment columnist called her the \"willowy blonde\" who had a \"dusty voice\" and a \"generous mouth\".\nThe song she is mostly remembered for is \"F\u00fcr mich soll's rote Rosen regnen\" (\"Let it rain red roses for me\"). She is also known for her version of the songs \"Ich hab noch einen Koffer in Berlin\" (\"I still have a suitcase in Berlin\") and \"Mackie Messer\" (\"Mack the Knife\"). She sold more than three million records in total.\nShe launched 23 original albums with 320 different songs. She wrote the lyrics for 130 songs herself.\nPublications.\nHer autobiography \"Der geschenkte Gaul: Bericht aus einem Leben\" (\"The Gift Horse: Report on a Life\", 1970) was a candid recount of her life in Germany during and after the Second World War, and reportedly became the best-selling German book in the post-war years. Her second book \"Das Urteil\" (\"The Verdict\", 1975) was a moderate success, and dealt with her struggle with breast cancer. Knef not only achieved international best-seller status, her books were also widely praised by critics because her autobiographies were \"better-than-the-average celebrity's\".\nIn \"The Gift Horse: Report on a Life\" Knef recounted her childhood and difficult life being an actress and singer while living in Hitler's Berlin and after the war in Europe and America. Arthur Cooper of \"Newsweek\" called it \"a bitterly honest book and a very good one\". The book doesn't try to persuade the public, depicting a made-up celebrity's adventures, but truthfully recounts her struggles as a German woman who grew up in Berlin under the Nazis.\"The Gift Horse: Report on a Life\" was translated to English by Knef's second husband, David Anthony Palastanga.\nIn \"The Verdict\", which was also translated by Palastanga, Knef looked at her life from another perspective, because she knew that she had cancer. Rachel MacKenzie wrote that Knef had her 56th operation, a mastectomy, in Salzburg on 10 August 1973. MacKenzie stated that from that cancer surgery, life had to be thought of in terms of pre-verdict and post-verdict. The book is divided in these two sections but they are not chronologically ordered because Knef wrote the two sections in a way that the reader is moved forward and backward in time and space. \"The Verdict\" describes in great detail the hospital scenes as well as the doctors and nurses in New York, Los Angeles, Z\u00fcrich and Hamburg, where she was hospitalised.\nPersonal life.\nKnef was married three times and divorced twice. Her first marriage was in 1947 to Kurt Hirsch, a U.S. information officer. They divorced in 1952. Her second marriage was to the actor and record producer David Anthony Palastanga, on 30 June 1962, with whom she had a daughter, Christina Antonia, born in 1968. When she died, she was still married to her third husband, Paul von Schell.\nOn 1 February 2002, Knef died at the age of 76 of a lung infection in Berlin, where she had moved after German reunification. She smoked heavily for most of her life and suffered from emphysema.\nSelected filmography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "37627", "revid": "49409179", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37627", "title": "BBC World Service", "text": "International radio division of the BBC\nThe BBC World Service is a British public service broadcaster owned and operated by the BBC. It is the world's largest external broadcaster in terms of reception area, language selection and audience reach. It broadcasts radio news, speech and discussions in more than 40 languages to many parts of the world on analogue and digital shortwave platforms, internet streaming, podcasting, satellite, DAB, FM, LW and MW relays. In 2024, the World Service reached an average of 450\u00a0million people a week (via TV, radio and online).\nBBC World Service English maintains eight regional feeds with several programme variations, covering, respectively, East and Southern Africa; West and Central Africa; Europe and Middle East; the Americas and Caribbean; East Asia; South Asia; Australasia; and the United Kingdom. There are also two online-only streams, a general one and the other more news-orientated, known as \"News Internet\". The service broadcasts 24 hours a day.\nThe World Service states that its aim is to be \"the world's best-known and most-respected voice in international broadcasting\", while retaining a \"balanced British view\" of international developments. Former director Peter Horrocks visualised the organisation as fighting an \"information war\" of soft power against Russian and Chinese international state media, including RT. As such, the BBC has been banned in both Russia and China, the former following its 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\nThe director of the BBC World Service is Jonathan Munro. The controller of the BBC World Service in English is Jon Zilkha.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nThe BBC World Service began on 19 December 1932 (emitted from the Daventry transmitting station) as the Empire Short Wave Service, broadcasting on shortwave and aimed principally at English speakers across the British Empire. In his first Christmas Message (1932), King George V characterised the service as intended for \"men and women, so cut off by the snow, the desert, or the sea, that only voices out of the air can reach them\". First hopes for the Empire Service were low. The Director-General, Sir John Reith, said in the opening programme:\nDon't expect too much in the early days; for some time we shall transmit comparatively simple programmes, to give the best chance of intelligible reception and provide evidence as to the type of material most suitable for the service in each zone. The programmes will neither be very interesting nor very good.\nThis address was read out five times as the BBC broadcast it live to different parts of the world.\nWorld War II.\nThe BBC would continue to claim independence from the Government during the war, but as Asa Briggs noted, a complete picture of the wartime BBC would have to include 'persistent references' to the various connected agencies of the government. Chiefly, the Political Warfare Executive, responsible for all broadcasts to Europe.\nOn 3 January 1938, the first foreign-language service was launched\u2014in Arabic. Programmes in German, Italian and French began broadcasting on 27 September 1938 projecting the British quest for peace in the days prior to the conference on the Munich Agreement.\nBy the end of 1942, the BBC had started broadcasts in all major European languages. The Empire Service was renamed the BBC Overseas Service in November 1939, supplemented by the addition of a dedicated BBC European Service from 1941. Funding for these services\u2014known administratively as the External Services of the BBC\u2014came not from the domestic licence fee but from government grant-in-aid (from the Foreign Office budget).\nThe External Services broadcast propaganda during the Second World War, on the German-language service Londoner Rundfunk especially against Nazi rule, believed in the early days of the war at least to have weak support. Its French service ' also sent coded messages to the French Resistance. George Orwell broadcast many news bulletins on the Eastern Service during the Second World War. The Belgian government in exile broadcast from Radio Belgique.\nCold War.\nThe 1956 Hungarian uprising held enormous implications for international radio broadcasting as it related to western foreign policy during the Cold War. Western broadcasts (especially the US's RFE) incited an expectation of support that had already been decided against by President Eisenhower. The BBC, unlike other broadcasters, did not lose credibility in the crisis. It showed sensitivity and acted as its own censor when diplomacy may have been jeopardised otherwise.\nIn stark contrast stood the BBC's reporting on the Suez Crisis of the same year. Although the British government tried to censor the BBC, it continued its even-handed reporting to both home as well as all foreign audiences. The row had the government seriously consider taking over the service when then prime minister Anthony Eden wanted to ensure that only the government line\u2014that the British and French only invaded Eqypt to keep peace and because its president Nasser was breaking international law\u2014would reach the home (and international) audience.\nBy the end of the 1940s, the number of broadcast languages had expanded and reception had improved, following the opening of a relay in Malaya and of the Limassol relay in Cyprus in 1957.\nAlso in 1957, a number of foreign language services were discontinued, or reduced.\nIn 1962, the Foreign Office argued that the VOA's philosophy, as presented to it by its then director Henry Loomis, not to broadcast to fully-developed allied countries in their respective languages should be adopted by the BBC. The reluctance of the BBC to drop those services was predicted also.\nOn 1 May 1965, the service took its current name of BBC World Service. It expanded its reach with the opening of the Ascension Island relay in 1966, serving African audiences with a stronger signal and better reception, and with the later relay on the Island of Masirah in Oman.\nIn August 1985, the service went off-air for the first time when workers went on strike in protest at the British government's decision to ban a documentary featuring an interview with Martin McGuinness of Sinn F\u00e9in.\nSubsequently, financial pressures decreased the number and the types of services offered by the BBC. Audiences in countries with wide access to Internet services have less need for terrestrial radio. Broadcasts in German ended in March 1999, after research showed that the majority of German listeners tuned into the English-language service. Broadcasts in Dutch, Finnish, French, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese and Malay stopped for similar reasons.\nTwenty-first century.\nOn 25 October 2005, the BBC announced that broadcasts in Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Greek, Hungarian, Kazakh, Polish, Slovak, Slovene and Thai would end by March 2006, to finance the launch in 2007 of television news services in Arabic and Persian. Additionally, Romanian broadcasts ceased on 1 August 2008.\nIn 2007, the last FM broadcast of BBC News Russian was discontinued at the order of the Russian government. Finam owned Bolshoye Radio, the last of three services to drop the BBC Russia broadcasts. A spokesman for the organisation claimed that 'any media which is government-financed is propaganda \u2013 it's a fact, it's not negative'. Reports put the development in the context of criticism of the Russian government for curbing media freedom ahead of the 2008 Russian presidential election. Reporters Without Borders condemned the move as censorship.\nIn 2011, BBC Kyrgyz service newsreader and producer Arslan Koichiev resigned from his BBC post after revelations and claims of involvement in the Kyrgyzstan revolution of April 2010. He had been based in London, but often travelled to Kyrgyzstan and used BBC resources to agitate against President Kurmanbek Bakiyev, appearing on a Kyrgyz radio station under a pseudonym with a disguised voice. One of the leaders of the revolution, Aliyasbek Alymkulov, named the producer as his mentor and claimed that they had discussed preparations for the revolution.\nAccording to London newspaper the \"Evening Standard\", \"Mr Alymkulov claimed that Koichiev arranged secret meetings \"through the BBC\" and organised the march at the presidential palace on 7 April 2010\"\nIn October 2010, the UK government announced that it was reducing the service's revenue funding by 16% and its capital funding by 52% by 2017. This necessitated over 650 staff leaving. Funding from the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office would end in April 2014, when funding would mainly be from the television licence fee. From 2010, the service started transforming from a mainly radio-based operation to multi-media.\nIn January 2011, the closure of the Albanian, Macedonian, and Serbian, as well as English for the Caribbean and Portuguese for Africa, services was announced. The British government announced that the three Balkan countries had wide access to international information, and so broadcasts in the local languages had become unnecessary. This decision reflected the financial situation the Corporation faced following transfer of responsibility for the Service from the Foreign Office, so that it would in future have been funded from within licence-fee income. The Russian, Ukrainian, Mandarin Chinese, Turkish, Vietnamese and Spanish for Cuba services ceased radio broadcasting, and the Hindi, Indonesian, Kyrgyz, Nepali, Swahili, Kinyarwanda and Kirundi services ceased shortwave transmissions. As part of the 16% budget cut, 650 jobs were eliminated.\nIn 2012, London staff moved from Bush House to Broadcasting House, so co-located with other BBC News departments. About 35% of its 1,518 full-time equivalent staff in 2014 were based overseas at 115 locations. From 2014 the service became part of World Service Group under the Director of BBC News and Current Affairs.\nFrom 2016, 1,100 additional staff were recruited as part of an expansion of the World Service, about a 70% increase, funded by the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office providing \u00a3254 million/year for five years, partly a reversal of the government decision that the television licence fee would fund the service from 2014. This was the biggest service expansion since World War II.\nIn 2022, a new London-based China unit was in development, described by the government as \"focused on exposing the challenges and realities currently facing China and its fight for global influence\".\nOperation.\nThe Service broadcasts from Broadcasting House in London, which is also headquarters of the corporation. It is located in the newer parts of the building, which contains radio and television studios for use by the overseas language services. The building also contains an integrated newsroom used by the international World Service, the international television channel BBC World News, the domestic television and radio BBC News bulletins, the BBC News Channel and BBC Online.\nAt its launch, the Service was located along with most radio output in Broadcasting House. However, following the explosion of a parachute mine nearby on 8 December 1940, it relocated to premises away from the likely target of Broadcasting House. The Overseas service relocated to Oxford Street while the European service moved temporarily to the emergency broadcasting facilities at Maida Vale Studios. The European services moved permanently into Bush House towards the end of 1940, completing the move in 1941, with the Overseas services joining them in 1958. Bush House subsequently became the home of the BBC World Service and the building itself has gained a global reputation with the audience of the service. However, the building was vacated in 2012 as a result of the Broadcasting House redevelopment and the end of the building's lease that year; the first service to move was the Burmese Service on 11 March 2012 and the final broadcast from Bush House was a news bulletin broadcast at 11.00GMT on 12 July 2012.\nThe BBC World Service encompasses an English 24-hour global radio network and separate services in 27 other languages. News and information is available in these languages on the BBC website, with many having RSS feeds and specific versions for use on mobile devices, and some also offer email notification of stories. In addition to the English service, 18 of the language services broadcast a radio service using the short wave, AM or FM bands. These are also available to listen live or can be listened to later (usually for seven days) over the Internet and, in the case of seven language services, can be downloaded as podcasts. News is also available from the BBC News 'app', which is available from both iTunes and the Google Play Store. In recent years, video content has also been used by the World Service: 16 language services show video reports on the website, and the Arabic and Persian services have their own television channels. TV is also used to broadcast the radio service, with local cable and satellite operators providing the English network (and occasionally some local language services) free to air. The English service is also available on digital radio in the UK and Europe.\nTraditionally, the Service relied on shortwave broadcasts, because of their ability to overcome barriers of censorship, distance, and spectrum scarcity. The BBC has maintained a worldwide network of shortwave relay stations since the 1940s, mainly in former British colonies. These cross-border broadcasts have also been used in special circumstances for emergency messages to British subjects abroad, such as the advice to evacuate Jordan during the Black September incidents of September 1970. These facilities were privatised in 1997 as Merlin Communications, and later acquired and operated as part of a wider network for multiple broadcasters by VT Communications (now part of Babcock International Group). It is also common for BBC programmes to air on Voice of America or ORF transmitters, while their programming is relayed by a station located inside the UK. However, since the 1980s, satellite distribution has made it possible for local stations to relay BBC programmes.\nBBC World Service is not regulated by Ofcom as the BBC generally is. Instead, the BBC is responsible for editorial independence and setting strategic direction. It defines the remit, scope, annual budget and main commitments of the World Service, and agrees \"objectives, targets and priorities\" with the British Foreign Secretary in a document named the BBC World Service Licence. The Chair of the BBC Board and the Foreign Secretary (or representatives) meet at least annually to review performance against these objectives, priorities and targets.\nFunding.\nThe World Service was funded for decades by grant-in-aid through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office until 1 April 2014. Since then it has been funded by a mixture of the United Kingdom's television licence fee, limited advertising, profits of BBC Studios, and Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) funding.\nFrom 2014, the service was guaranteed \u00a3289\u00a0million (allocated over a five-year period ending in 2020) from the UK government. In 2016, the government announced that the licence fee funding for the World Service would be \u00a3254 million/year for the five years from 2017. From 2016 to 2022, the FCDO contributed over \u00a3470 million to the World Service via its World 2020 Programme, about 80% of which is categorised as Overseas Development Assistance, amounting to about a quarter of the World Service budget. In November 2022, the government confirmed the continuing involvement of the FCDO in funding the World Service.\nIn 2025, the FCDO asked the BBC to draw up World Service budget cut options as input to the forthcoming spending review. In response, the government's new soft power council warned of the impact on British soft power around the world. Of the World Service's existing government funding, 80% is designated as official development assistance, which the government intends to cut by nearly half to increase defence spending. The BBC sought funding from the UK defence budget for the World Service, for example to cover media monitoring and anti-disinformation as contributing to British security activities.\nLanguages.\nThis table lists the various language services operated by the BBC World Service with start and closure dates, where known/applicable.\nRadio programming in English.\nThe World Service in English mainly broadcasts news and analysis. The mainstays of the current schedule are \"Newsday\", \"Newshour\" and \"The Newsroom\". Daily science programmes include: \"Health Check\", and \"Science in Action\". \"Sportsworld\", which often includes live commentary of Premier League football matches is broadcast at weekends. Other weekend sport shows include \"The Sports Hour\" and \"Stumped\", a cricket programme co-produced with All India Radio and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. On Sundays, the discussion programme 'The Forum' is broadcast. \"Outlook\" is a human interest programme which was first broadcast in July 1966 and presented for more than thirty years by John Tidmarsh. \"Trending\" describes itself as \"explaining the stories the world is sharing...\" Regular music programmes were reintroduced with the autumn schedule in 2015. Many programmes, particularly speech-based ones, are also available as podcasts. \"Business Daily\" is a weekday live international business news programme, which broadcasts from 8:32:30am to 8:59:00am UK time from Broadcasting House in London.\nPrevious radio programming in English.\nPrevious broadcasts included popular music programmes presented by John Peel and classical music programmes presented by Edward Greenfield. There have also been religious programmes, of mostly Anglican celebration and often from the Church of St. Martin in the Fields, weekly drama, English-language lessons, and comedy including \"Just A Minute\". Other notable previous programmes include \"Letter from America\" by Alistair Cooke, which was broadcast for over fifty years; \"Off the Shelf\" with its daily reading from a novel, biography or history book; \"A Jolly Good Show\", a music request programme presented by Dave Lee Travis; \"Waveguide\", a radio reception guide; and \"The Merchant Navy Programme\", a show for seafarers presented by Malcolm Billings; \"The Morning Show\", \"Good Morning Africa\" and \"PM\", all presented by Pete Myers in the 1960s and 1970s.\nSince the late 1990s, the station has focused more on news, with bulletins added every half-hour following the outbreak of the Iraq War.\nNews.\nNews is at the core of the scheduling. A five-minute bulletin is generally transmitted at 01 past the hour, with a two-minute summary at 30 past the hour. Sometimes these are separate from other programming, or alternatively made integral to the programme (such as with \"The Newsroom\", \"Newshour\" or \"Newsday\"). In October 2024, it was announced that the bulletins would be broadcast on domestic BBC radio stations during the night. During such time slots as weeknights 11pm-12am GMT and that of \"Sportsworld\", no news summaries are broadcast. As part of the BBC's policy for breaking news, the Service is the first to receive a full report for foreign news.\nAvailability.\nAmericas.\nBBC World Service is available by subscription to Sirius XM's satellite radio service in the United States. Its Canadian affiliate, Sirius XM Canada, does the same in Canada. More than 300 public radio stations across the US carry World Service news broadcasts \u2013 mostly during the overnight and early-morning hours \u2013 over AM and FM radio, distributed by American Public Media (APM). Some public radio stations also carry the World Service in its entirety via HD Radio. The BBC and Public Radio International (PRI) co-produce the programme \"The World\" with WGBH Radio Boston, and the BBC was previously involved with \"The Takeaway\" morning news programme based at WNYC in New York City. BBC World Service programming also airs as part of CBC Radio One's \"CBC Radio Overnight\" schedule in Canada.\nBBC shortwave broadcasts to this region were traditionally enhanced by the Atlantic Relay Station and the Caribbean Relay Company, a station in Antigua run jointly with Deutsche Welle. In addition, an exchange agreement with Radio Canada International gave access to their station in New Brunswick. However, \"changing listening habits\" led the World Service to end shortwave radio transmission directed to North America and Australasia on 1 July 2001. A shortwave listener coalition formed to oppose the change.\nThe BBC broadcasts to Central America and South America in several languages. It is possible to receive the Western African shortwave radio broadcasts from eastern North America, but the BBC does not guarantee reception in this area. It has ended its specialist programming to the Falkland Islands but continues to provide a stream of World Service programming to the Falkland Islands Radio Service.\nAsia.\nFor several decades, the World Service's largest audiences have been in Asia, the Middle East, Near East and South Asia. Transmission facilities in the UK and Cyprus were supplemented by the former BBC Eastern Relay Station in Oman and the Far Eastern Relay Station in Singapore, formerly in Malaysia. The East Asian Relay Station moved to Thailand in 1997 when Hong Kong was handed over to Chinese sovereignty. The relay station in Thailand was closed during January 2017, and in Singapore during July 2023; currently, a relay station in Masirah, Oman serves the Asian region. Together, these facilities have given the BBC World Service an easily accessible signal in regions where shortwave listening has traditionally been popular. The English shortwave frequencies of 6.195 (49m band), 9.74 (31m band), 15.31/15.36 (19m band) and 17.76/17.79 (16m band) were widely known. On 25 March 2018, the long-established shortwave frequency of 9.74\u00a0MHz was changed to 9.9\u00a0MHz.\nThe largest audiences are in English, Hindi, Urdu, Nepali, Bengali, Sinhala, Tamil, Marathi and other major languages of South Asia, where BBC broadcasters are household names. The Persian service is the \"de facto\" national broadcaster of Afghanistan, along with its Iranian audience. The World Service is available up to eighteen hours a day in English across most parts of Asia, and in Arabic for the Middle East. With the addition of relays in Afghanistan and Iraq these services are accessible in most of the Middle and Near East in the evening. In Singapore, the BBC World Service in English has been carried on FM alongside domestic stations since 1976, via a relay operated by the country's state-owned broadcaster Mediacorp. For many years Radio Television Hong Kong broadcast BBC World Service 24/7 but as of 12 February 2021, Hong Kong has banned the BBC's World Service radio from its airwaves, following swiftly on the heels of China's decision to bar its World News television channels, seemingly in retaliation for Ofcom revoking the UK broadcasting licence of China Global Television Network. In the Philippines, DZRJ 810 AM and its FM sister station RJFM 100.3 broadcasts the BBC World Service in English from 06:00 to 20:00 PHT from Mondays to Saturdays.\nAlthough this region has seen the launch of the only two foreign language television channels, several other services have had their radio services closed as a result of budget cuts and redirection of resources.\nJapan and Korea have little tradition of World Service listening, although during the Second World War and in the 1970s to 1980s, shortwave listening was popular in Japan. In those two countries, the BBC World Service was only available via shortwave and the Internet. As of September 2007, a satellite transmission (subscription required) became available by Skylife (Channel 791) in South Korea. In November 2016, the BBC World Service announced it plans to start broadcasts in Korean. \"BBC Korean\", a radio and web service, started on 25 September 2017.\nJamming.\nThe Soviet Union, Iran, Iraq and Myanmar/Burma have all jammed the BBC in the past. Mandarin was heavily jammed by the People's Republic of China until shortwave transmissions for that service ceased but China continues to jam transmissions in Uzbek and has since started to jam transmissions in English throughout Asia.\nEurope.\nThe BBC World Service is broadcast in Berlin on 94.8\u00a0MHz. FM relays are also available in Ceske Budjovice, Karlovy Vary, Plzen, Usti nad Labem, Zlin and Prague in the Czech Republic, Pristina, Riga, Tallinn, Tirana and Vilnius. The station is also available in Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland on 94.5\u00a0MHz FM. A BBC World Service channel is available on DAB+ in Brussels and Flanders and Amsterdam, the Hague, Utrecht and Rotterdam. Following a national reorganisation of DAB multiplexes in October 2017, the station is available on DAB+ across the whole of Denmark.\nThe World Service employed a medium wave transmitter at Orford Ness to provide English-language coverage to Europe, including on the frequency 648\u00a0kHz (which could be heard in parts of the south-east of England during the day and most of the UK after dark). Transmissions on this frequency were stopped on 27 March 2011, as a consequence of the budgetary constraints imposed on the BBC World Service in the 2010 budget review. A second channel (1296\u00a0kHz) traditionally broadcast in various Central European languages, but this frequency has also been discontinued and in 2005 it began regular English-language transmissions via the Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM) format. This is a digital shortwave technology that VT expects to become the standard for cross-border transmissions in developed countries.\nIn the 1990s, the BBC purchased and constructed large medium wave and FM networks in the former Soviet bloc, particularly the Czech (BBC Czech Section), Slovak Republics (BBC Slovak Section), Poland (BBC Polish Section) (where it was a national network) and Russia (BBC Russian Service). It had built up a strong audience during the Cold War, whilst economic restructuring made it difficult for these governments to refuse Western investment. Many of these facilities have now returned to domestic control, as economic and political conditions have changed.\nOn Monday, 18 February 2008, the BBC World Service stopped analogue shortwave transmissions to Europe. The notice stated, \"Increasing numbers of people around the world are choosing to listen to radio on a range of other platforms including FM, satellite and online, with fewer listening on shortwave.\" It is sometimes possible to pick up the BBC World Service in Europe on SW frequencies targeted at North Africa. The BBC's powerful 198\u00a0kHz LW, which broadcasts the domestic BBC Radio 4 to Britain during the day (and carries the World Service during the night) can also be heard in nearby parts of Europe, including the Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands, Belgium and parts of France, Germany and Scandinavia.\nIn Malta, BBC News bulletins are carried by a number of radio stations, including Radju Malta and Magic 91.7, owned by national broadcaster PBS Ltd. These are broadcast at various points in the day and supplement news bulletins broadcast in Maltese from the PBS Newsroom.\nFormer BBC shortwave transmitters are located in the United Kingdom at Rampisham Down in Dorset, Woofferton in Shropshire and Skelton in Cumbria. The former BBC East Mediterranean Relay Station is in Cyprus.\nIn response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the BBC began broadcasting World Service English programming at shortwave frequencies 15.735\u00a0MHz and 5875\u00a0kHz for receivers in Ukraine and parts of Russia.\nPacific.\nThe World Service is available as part of the subscription Digital Air package (available from Foxtel and Austar) in Australia. ABC NewsRadio, SBS Radio, and various community radio stations also broadcast many programmes. Many of these stations broadcast a straight feed during the midnight to dawn period. It was also available via the satellite service Optus Aurora, which is encrypted but available without subscription. In Sydney, Australia, a transmission of the service can be received at 152.025\u00a0MHz. It is also available on the DAB+ Network in Australia on SBS Radio 4 (except during Eurovision and special events). 2MBS-FM 102.5, a classical music station in Sydney, also carries the BBC World Service news programmes at 7a.m. and 8a.m. on weekdays, during its \"Music for a New Day\" breakfast programme.\nShortwave relays from Singapore (see Asia, above) continue, but historic relays via Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and Radio New Zealand International were wound down in the late 1990s. BBC World Service relays on Radio Australia now carry the BBC Radio news programmes.\nIn the Pacific and New Zealand, the Auckland Radio Trust operates a BBC World Service network as a non-profit donation-funded public broadcaster. It broadcasts on 810\u00a0kHz in Auckland, 107.0\u00a0MHz in Whitianga and Whangamat\u0101, 107.3\u00a0MHz in Kaipara Harbour, 88.2\u00a0MHz in Suva and Nadi, 100.0\u00a0MHz in Bairiki and Tarawa, 101.1\u00a0MHz in Pohnpei, 107.6\u00a0MHz in Port Moresby, 105.9\u00a0MHz in Honiara, 99.0\u00a0MHz in Port Vila and Luganville, and 100.1\u00a0MHz in Funafuti. The station also broadcasts local content.\nIn New Zealand, AREC FM carries the BBC World Service 24/7 in the Wellington region. Available on 107.0\u00a0MHz in the CBD, 87.6\u00a0MHz in Porirua/Mana, and 87.9\u00a0MHz in Waikanae/Paraparaumu. AREC FM is a non-profit donation funded LPFM broadcaster and a subscriber to the Community Broadcasting Association of Australia's Community Radio Network (Australia).\nIn New Zealand, Radio Tarana and members of the Association of Community Access Broadcasters carry some BBC World Service programmes. The BBC World Service was previously available on 1233\u00a0kHz in Wellington between 1990 and 1994, and again from 1996 to 1997.\nUK.\nThe BBC World Service is broadcast on DAB, Freeview, Virgin Media and Sky platforms, as well as on BBC Sounds. It is also broadcast overnight on the frequencies of BBC Radio 4 and the Welsh language service BBC Radio Cymru following their closedown at 0000 or 0100 British time. The BBC World Service does not receive funding for broadcasts to the UK. In southeast England, the station could be picked up reliably on medium wave 648\u00a0kHz, which was targeted at mainland Europe.\nAccording to RAJAR, the station broadcasts to a weekly audience of 1.2 million with a listening share of 0.7% as of March 2024.\nPresentation.\nOpening tune.\nThe World Service uses several tunes and sounds to represent the station. A previous signature tune of the station was a five note motif, composed by David Arnold and which comprises a variety of voices declaim \"This is the BBC in...\" before going on to name various cities (e.g. Kampala, Milan, Delhi, Johannesburg), followed by the station's slogan and the Greenwich Time Signal. This was heard throughout the network with a few variations \u2013 in the UK the full service name was spoken, whereas just the name of the BBC was used outside the UK. The phrase \"This is London\" was used previously in place of a station slogan.\nThe tune \"Lillibullero\" was another well known signature tune of the network following its broadcast previously as part of the top-of-the-hour sequence. This piece of music is no longer heard before news bulletins. The use of the tune gained minor controversy because of its background as a Protestant marching song in Northern Ireland.\nThe \"Prince of Denmark's March\" (commonly known as the \"Trumpet Voluntary\") was often broadcast by the BBC Radio during World War II, especially when programming was directed to occupied Denmark, as the march symbolised a connection between the two countries. It remained for many years the signature tune of the BBC European Service.\nIn addition to these tunes, the BBC World Service also uses several interval signals. The English service uses a recording of Bow Bells, made in 1926 and used a symbol of hope during World War II, only replaced for a brief time during the 1970s with the tune to the nursery rhyme \"Oranges and Lemons\". The morse code of the letter \"V\" has also been used as a signal and was introduced in January 1941 and had several variations including timpani, the first four notes of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony (which coincide with the letter \"V\"), and electronic tones which until recently remained in use for some Western European services. In other languages, the interval signal is three notes, pitched B\u2013B-C. However, these symbols have been used less frequently.\nTime.\nThe network operates using Greenwich Mean Time, regardless of the time zone and time of year, and is announced on the hour on the English service as \"13 hours GMT\" (1300 GMT) or \"Midnight Greenwich Mean Time\" (0000 GMT). The BBC World Service traditionally broadcasts the chimes of Big Ben in London at the start of a new year.\n\"This is London\".\nA BBC News report would begin with its station identification phrase \"This is London\" or \"This is London calling\". The phrase has become a trademark of the BBC World Service, and has been influential in popular culture, such as music. In 1979, the British punk rock band The Clash released the hit song \"London Calling\", which was partly based on the station identification phrase.\nDuring the Eurovision Song Contest, before announcing the contest points from the UK, the broadcaster from the BBC delivering the votes usually begins with \"This is London Calling\". In 2019, the BBC started a weekly podcast called \"Eurovision Calling\" with Jayde Adams and Scott Mills.\nMagazine publishing.\nThe BBC World Service previously published magazines and programme guides:\nAssessments.\nBritish soft power.\nThe World Service claims that its aim is to be \"the world's best-known and most-respected voice in international broadcasting, thereby bringing benefit to the UK, the BBC, and to audiences around the world\", while retaining a \"balanced British view\" of international developments. In 2022, the \"Financial Times\" wrote that the World Service \"is considered a pillar of British soft power\", and a House of Lords Library report noted the widespread recognition of this soft power. According to the American socialist magazine \"Monthly Review\" in 2022, former director Peter Horrocks inferred the World Service's scope to Russian state broadcaster RT as a means of extending international influence and soft power.\nIn 2014, Conservative MP John Whittingdale, chair of the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, characterising the BBC's primary mission as fighting an 'Information War' (a role which some media scholars agree to), saying: \"We are being outgunned massively by the Russians and Chinese and that's something I've raised with the BBC. It is frightening the extent to which we are losing the information war.\" In March 2022, as the Russian invasion of Ukraine started, the UK government announced additional emergency funding for the World Service to provide \"independent, impartial and accurate news to people in Ukraine and Russia in the face of increased propaganda from the Russian state\" and to counter \"Putin's lies and exposing his propaganda and fake news\".\nBBC Persian Service.\nIn the context of the Iranian Revolution, the BBC World Service's Persian-language service has been criticised for its role in promoting the Shah's regime and undermining local norms in favour of British-selected values, with the British Ambassador in Iran, Peter Ramsbotham, stating in reaction to a Service-sponsored poetry contest (in celebration of the 2500th anniversary of the founding of the Archaemenid empire) that the organisation \"seems to be damaging its image by acquiring a reputation for employing and supporting 'old brigade' expatriates.\"\nFurthermore, it appears that the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office made a concerted effort to produce favourable coverage of Persia to BBC World Service audiences in order to maintain cordiality with the Shah's regime. For example, in December 1973, a memo from Ramsbotham details a request from the Iranian Prime Minister for the text of a broadcast about Iran by Peter Avery, lecturer in Persian Studies and Fellow at King's College, Cambridge, which he deemed 'excellent' and wanted to show the Shah. This later became the programme \"Iran: Oil and the Shah's Arab Neighbours\" which was aired globally on 1 December 1973, much to the chagrin of the Iranian people, who began airing their frustrations against the British government out on the BBC Persian Service; By 1976, Ramsbotham's successor, Sir Anthony Parsons, concluded that the Persian Service has lost its propaganda value and supported discontinuing the service: \"[It] is well known that the vernacular service is financed by the FCO and is therefore firmly considered by the Iranians as an official organ of the government.\"\nIn September 2022, the World Service announced the closure of its Persian and Arabic radio services as part of a cost-cutting plan, but the online and TV services would remain.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The neutron release generated by a nuclear fusion reaction is intentionally allowed to escape the weapon, rather than being absorbed by its other components. The neutron burst, which is used as the primary destructive action of the warhead, is able to penetrate enemy armor more effectively than a conventional warhead, thus making it more lethal as a tactical weapon.\nThe concept was originally developed by the United States in the late 1950s and early 1960s. It was seen as a \"cleaner\" bomb for use against massed Soviet armored divisions. As these would be used over allied nations, notably West Germany, the reduced blast damage was seen as an important advantage. During the Cold War, China also developed a neutron bomb but refrained from deploying it on tactical delivery systems.76\nERWs were first operationally deployed for anti-ballistic missiles (ABMs). In this role, the burst of neutrons would cause nearby warheads to undergo partial fission, preventing them from exploding properly. For this to work, the ABM would have to explode within approximately of its target. The first example of such a system was the W66, used on the Sprint missile used in the US Nike-X system. It is believed the Soviet equivalent, the A-135's 53T6 missile, uses a similar design.\nThe weapon was once again proposed for tactical use by the United States in the 1970s and 1980s, and production of the W70 began for the MGM-52 Lance in 1981. This time, it led to protests as the growing anti-nuclear movement gained strength through this period. Opposition was so intense that European leaders refused to accept it on their territory. US President Ronald Reagan ordered the production of the W70-3, which remained in the US stockpile until they were retired in 1992. The last W70 was dismantled in February 1996.\nBasic concept.\nIn a standard thermonuclear design, a small fission bomb is placed close to a larger mass of thermonuclear fuel, usually lithium deuteride. The two components are then placed within a thick radiation case, usually made from uranium, lead, or steel. The case traps the energy from the fission bomb for a brief period, allowing it to heat and compress the main thermonuclear fuel. The case is normally made of depleted uranium or natural uranium metal, because the thermonuclear reactions give off extraordinarily large numbers of high-energy neutrons that can cause fission reactions in the casing material. These can add considerable energy to the reaction; in a typical design, as much as 50% of the total energy comes from fission events in the casing. For this reason, these weapons are technically known as fission-fusion-fission designs.\nIn a neutron bomb, the casing material is selected either to be transparent to neutrons or to actively enhance their production. The burst of neutrons created in the thermonuclear reaction is then free to escape the bomb, outpacing the physical explosion. By carefully designing the thermonuclear stage of the weapon, the neutron burst can be maximized while minimizing the blast itself. This makes the lethal radius of the neutron burst greater than that of the explosion itself. Since the neutrons are absorbed or decay rapidly, such a burst over an enemy column would kill the crews but leave the area able to be quickly reoccupied.\nCompared to a pure fission bomb with an identical explosive yield, a neutron bomb would emit about ten times the amount of neutron radiation. In a fission bomb, at sea level, the total radiation pulse energy which is composed of both gamma rays and neutrons is approximately 5% of the entire energy released; in neutron bombs, it would be closer to 40%, with the percentage increase coming from the higher production of neutrons. Furthermore, the neutrons emitted by a neutron bomb have a much higher average energy level (close to 14 MeV) than those released during a fission reaction (1\u20132 MeV).\nTechnically speaking, every low-yield nuclear weapon is a radiation weapon, including non-enhanced variants. All nuclear weapons up to about 10 kilotons in yield have prompt neutron radiation as their furthest-reaching lethal component. For standard weapons above about 10 kilotons of yield, the lethal blast and thermal effects radius begins to exceed the lethal ionizing radiation radius. Enhanced radiation weapons also fall into this same yield range and simply enhance the intensity and range of the neutron dose for a given yield.\nHistory and deployment to present.\nThe conception of neutron bombs is generally credited to Samuel T. Cohen of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, who developed the concept in 1958. Initial development was carried out as part of projects Dove and Starling, and an early device was tested underground in early 1962. Designs for a \"weaponized\" version were developed in 1963.\nDevelopment of two production designs for the Army's MGM-52 Lance short-range missile began in July 1964, the W63 at Livermore and the W64 at Los Alamos. Both entered phase three testing in July 1964, and the W64 was cancelled in favor of the W63 in September 1964. The W63 was in turn cancelled in November 1965 in favor of the W70 (Mod 0), a conventional design. By this time, the same concepts were being used to develop warheads for the Sprint missile, an anti-ballistic missile (ABM), with Livermore designing the W65 and Los Alamos the W66. Both entered phase three testing in October 1965, but the W65 was cancelled in favor of the W66 in November 1968. Testing of the W66 was carried out in the late 1960s, and it entered production in June 1974, the first neutron bomb to do so. Approximately 120 were built, with about 70 of these being on active duty during 1975 and 1976 as part of the Safeguard Program. When that program was shut down they were placed in storage, and eventually decommissioned in the early 1980s.\nDevelopment of ER warheads for Lance continued, but in the early 1970s, attention had turned to using modified versions of the W70, the W70 Mod 3. Development was subsequently postponed by President Jimmy Carter in 1978 following protests against his administration's plans to deploy neutron warheads to ground forces in Europe. On November 17, 1978, in a test, the USSR detonated its first similar-type bomb. President Ronald Reagan restarted production in 1981. The Soviet Union renewed a propaganda campaign against the US's neutron bomb in 1981 following Reagan's announcement. In 1983, Reagan then announced the Strategic Defense Initiative, which surpassed neutron bomb production in ambition and vision and with that, neutron bombs quickly faded from the center of the public's attention.\nThree types of enhanced radiation weapons (ERW) were deployed by the United States. The W66 warhead, for the anti-ICBM Sprint missile system, was deployed in 1975 and retired the next year, along with the missile system. The W70 Mod 3 warhead was developed for the short-range, tactical MGM-52 Lance missile, and the W79 Mod 0 was developed for nuclear artillery shells. The latter two types were retired by President George H. W. Bush in 1992, following the end of the Cold War. The last W70 Mod 3 warhead was dismantled in 1996, and the last W79 Mod 0 was dismantled by 2003, when the dismantling of all W79 variants was completed.\nAccording to the Cox Report, as of 1999, the United States had never deployed a neutron weapon. The nature of this statement is not clear; it reads, \"The stolen information also includes classified design information for an enhanced radiation weapon (commonly known as the \"neutron bomb\"), which neither the United States, nor any other nation, has ever deployed.\" However, the fact that neutron bombs had been produced by the US was well known at this time and part of the public record. Cohen suggests the report is playing with the definitions; while the US bombs were never deployed \"to Europe\", they remained stockpiled in the US.\nIn addition to the two superpowers, France and China are known to have tested neutron or enhanced radiation bombs. France conducted an early test of the technology in 1967 and tested an actual neutron bomb in 1980. China conducted a successful test of neutron bomb principles in 1984 and a successful test of a neutron bomb in 1988. However, neither of those countries chose to deploy neutron bombs. Chinese nuclear scientists stated before the 1988 test that China had no need for neutron bombs, but it was developed to serve as a \"technology reserve\", in case the need arose in the future.\nIn May 1998, Senior Pakistani Scientist, Dr. N. M. Butt, stated that \"PAEC built a sufficient number of neutron bombs\u2014a battlefield weapon that is essentially a low yield device\".\nIn August 1999, the Indian government stated that India was capable of producing a neutron bomb.\nAlthough no country is currently known to deploy them in an offensive manner, all thermonuclear dial-a-yield warheads that have about 10 kiloton and lower as one dial option, with a considerable fraction of that yield derived from fusion reactions, can be considered able to be neutron bombs in use, if not in name. The only country definitely known to deploy dedicated (that is, not dial-a-yield) neutron warheads for any length of time is the Soviet Union/Russia, which inherited the USSR's neutron warhead equipped ABM-3 Gazelle missile program. This ABM system contains at least 68 neutron warheads with a 10-kiloton yield each and it has been in service since 1995, with inert missile testing approximately every other year since then (2014). The system is designed to destroy incoming endoatmospheric nuclear warheads aimed at Moscow and other targets and is the lower-tier/last umbrella of the A-135 anti-ballistic missile system (NATO reporting name: ABM-3).\nBy 1984, according to Mordechai Vanunu, Israel was mass-producing neutron bombs.\nConsiderable controversy arose in the US and Western Europe following a June 1977 \"Washington Post\" expos\u00e9 describing US government plans to equip US Armed Forces with neutron bombs. The article focused on the fact that it was the first weapon specifically intended to kill humans with radiation. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory director Harold Brown and Soviet General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev both described neutron bombs as a \"capitalist bomb\", because it was designed to destroy people while preserving property.\nUse.\nNeutron bombs are purposely designed with explosive yields lower than other nuclear weapons. Since neutrons are scattered and absorbed by air, neutron radiation effects drop off rapidly with distance in air. As such, there is a sharper distinction, relative to thermal effects, between areas of high lethality and areas with minimal radiation doses. No high yield (more than c.\u00a010\u00a0kiloton) nuclear bombs, including the extreme example of the 50 megaton Tsar Bomba, are able to radiate sufficient neutrons beyond their lethal blast range when detonated as a surface burst or low altitude air burst and so are not classified as neutron bombs, thus limiting the yield of neutron bombs to a maximum of about 10 kilotons. The intense pulse of high-energy neutrons generated by a neutron bomb is the principal killing mechanism, not the fallout, heat or blast.\nThe inventor of the neutron bomb, Sam Cohen, criticized the description of the W70 as a neutron bomb since it could be configured to yield 100 kilotons:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;the W-70 ... is not even remotely a \"neutron bomb.\" Instead of being the type of weapon that, in the popular mind, \"kills people and spares buildings\" it is one that both kills and physically destroys on a massive scale. The W-70 is not a discriminate weapon, like the neutron bomb\u2014which, incidentally, should be considered a weapon that \"kills enemy personnel while sparing the physical fabric of the attacked populace, and even the populace too.\"\nAlthough neutron bombs are commonly believed to \"leave the infrastructure intact\", with current designs that have explosive yields in the low kiloton range, detonation in (or above) a built-up area would still cause a sizable degree of building destruction, through blast and heat effects out to a moderate radius, albeit considerably less destruction, than when compared to a standard nuclear bomb of the \"exact\" same total energy release or \"yield\".\nThe Warsaw Pact tank strength was over twice that of NATO, and Soviet deep battle doctrine was likely to be to use this numerical advantage to rapidly sweep across continental Europe if the Cold War ever turned hot. Any weapon that could break up their intended mass tank formation deployments and force them to deploy their tanks in a thinner, more easily dividable manner, would aid ground forces in the task of hunting down solitary tanks and using anti-tank missiles against them, such as the contemporary M47 Dragon and BGM-71 TOW missiles, of which NATO had hundreds of thousands.\nRather than making extensive preparations for battlefield nuclear combat in Central Europe, the Soviet military leadership believed that conventional superiority provided the Warsaw Pact with the means to approximate the effects of nuclear weapons and achieve victory in Europe without resort to those weapons.\nNeutron bombs, or more precisely, enhanced [neutron] radiation weapons were also to find use as strategic anti-ballistic missile weapons, and in this role, they are believed to remain in active service within Russia's Gazelle missile.\nEffects.\nUpon detonation, a near-ground airburst of a 1-kiloton neutron bomb would produce a large blast wave and a powerful pulse of both thermal radiation and ionizing radiation in the form of fast (14.1MeV) neutrons. The thermal pulse would cause third degree burns to unprotected skin out to approximately 500 meters. The blast would create pressures of at least 4.6psi (32 kPa) out to a radius of 600 meters, which would severely damage all non-reinforced concrete structures. At the conventional effective combat range against modern main battle tanks and armored personnel carriers (&lt;690\u2013900m), the blast from a 1kt neutron bomb would destroy or damage to the point of nonusability almost all un-reinforced civilian buildings.\nUsing neutron bombs to stop an enemy armored attack by rapidly incapacitating crews with a dose of 80+ Gy of radiation would require exploding large numbers of them to blanket the enemy forces, destroying all normal civilian buildings within c.600 meters of the immediate area. Neutron activation from the explosions could make many building materials in the city radioactive, such as galvanized steel (see area denial use below).\nBecause liquid-filled objects like the human body are resistant to gross overpressure, the 4\u20135psi (28-34 kPa) blast overpressure would cause very few direct casualties at a range of c.600m. The powerful winds produced by this overpressure, however, could throw bodies into objects or throw debris at high velocity, including window glass, both with potentially lethal results. Casualties would be highly variable depending on surroundings, including potential building collapses.\nThe pulse of neutron radiation would cause immediate and permanent incapacitation to unprotected outdoor humans in the open out to 900 meters, with death occurring in one or two days. The median lethal dose (LD50) of 6 Gray would extend to between 1350 and 1400 meters for those unprotected and outdoors, where approximately half of those exposed would die of radiation sickness after several weeks.\nA human residing within, or simply shielded by, at least one concrete building with walls and ceilings thick, or alternatively of damp soil 24 inches (60\u00a0cm) thick, would receive a neutron radiation exposure reduced by a factor of 10. Even near ground zero, basement sheltering or buildings with similar radiation shielding characteristics would drastically reduce the radiation dose.\nFurthermore, the neutron absorption spectrum of air is disputed by some authorities, and depends in part on absorption by hydrogen from water vapor. Thus, absorption might vary exponentially with humidity, making neutron bombs far more deadly in desert climates than in humid ones.\nEffectiveness in modern anti-tank role.\nThe questionable effectiveness of ER weapons against modern tanks is cited as one of the main reasons that these weapons are no longer fielded or stockpiled. With the increase in average tank armor thickness since the first ER weapons were fielded, it was argued in the March 13, 1986, \"New Scientist\" magazine that tank armor protection was approaching the level where tank crews would be almost fully protected from radiation effects. Thus, for an ER weapon to incapacitate a modern tank crew through irradiation, the weapon must be detonated at such proximity to the tank that the nuclear explosion's blast would now be equally effective at incapacitating it and its crew.\nHowever, although the author did note that effective neutron absorbers and neutron poisons such as boron carbide can be incorporated into conventional armor and strap-on neutron moderating hydrogenous material (substances containing hydrogen atoms), such as explosive reactive armor, increasing the protection factor, the author holds that in practice, combined with neutron scattering, the actual average total tank area protection factor is rarely higher than 15.5 to 35. According to the Federation of American Scientists, the neutron protection factor of a \"tank\" can be as low as 2, without qualifying whether the statement implies a light tank, medium tank, or main battle tank.\nA composite high-density concrete, or alternatively, a laminated graded-Z shield, 24 units thick of which 16 units are iron and 8 units are polyethylene containing boron (BPE), and additional mass behind it to attenuate neutron capture gamma rays, is more effective than just 24 units of pure iron or BPE alone, due to the advantages of both iron and BPE in combination. During neutron transport, iron is effective in slowing down/scattering high-energy neutrons in the 14-MeV energy range and attenuating gamma rays, while the hydrogen in polyethylene is effective in slowing down these now slower fast neutrons in the few MeV range, and boron-10 has a high absorption cross section for thermal neutrons and a low production yield of gamma rays when it absorbs a neutron. The Soviet T-72 tank, in response to the neutron bomb threat, is cited as having fitted a boronated polyethylene liner, which has had its neutron shielding properties simulated.\nHowever, some tank armor material contains depleted uranium (DU), common in the US's M1A1 Abrams tank, which incorporates steel-encased depleted uranium armor, a substance that will fast fission when it captures a fast, fusion-generated neutron, and thus on fissioning will produce fission neutrons and fission products embedded within the armor, products which emit, among other things, penetrating gamma rays. Although the neutrons emitted by the neutron bomb may not penetrate to the tank crew in lethal quantities, the fast fission of DU within the armor could still ensure a lethal environment for the crew and maintenance personnel by fission neutron and gamma ray exposure, largely depending on the exact thickness and elemental composition of the armor\u2014information usually hard to attain. Despite this, Ducrete\u2014which has an elemental composition similar (but not identical) to the ceramic second-generation heavy metal Chobham armor of the Abrams tank\u2014is an effective radiation shield, to both fission neutrons and gamma rays due to it being a graded-Z material. Uranium, being about twice as dense as lead, is thus nearly twice as effective at shielding gamma ray radiation per unit thickness.\nUse against ballistic missiles.\nAs an anti-ballistic missile weapon, the first fielded ER warhead, the W66, was developed for the Sprint missile system as part of the Safeguard Program to protect United States cities and missile silos from incoming Soviet warheads.\nA problem faced by Sprint and similar ABMs was that the blast effects of their warheads change greatly as they climb and the atmosphere thins out. At higher altitudes, starting around and above, the blast effects begin to drop off rapidly as the air density becomes very low. This can be countered by using a larger warhead, but then it becomes too powerful when used at lower altitudes. An ideal system would use a mechanism that was less sensitive to changes in air density.\nNeutron-based attacks offer one solution to this problem. The burst of neutrons released by an ER weapon can induce fission in the fissile materials of primary in the target warhead. The energy released by these reactions may be enough to melt the warhead, but even at lower fission rates, the \"burning up\" of some of the fuel in the primary can cause it to fail to explode properly, or \"fizzle\". Thus, a small ER warhead can be effective across a wide altitude band, using blast effects at lower altitudes and the increasingly long-ranged neutrons as the engagement rises.\nThe use of neutron-based attacks was discussed as early as the 1950s, with the US Atomic Energy Commission mentioning weapons with a \"clean, enhanced neutron output\" for use as \"antimissile defensive warheads.\" Studying, improving and defending against such attacks was a major area of research during the 1950s and '60s. A particular example of this is the US Polaris A-3 missile, which delivered three warheads travelling on roughly the same trajectory, and thus with a short distance between them. A single ABM could conceivably destroy all three through neutron flux. Developing warheads that were less sensitive to these attacks was also a major area of research in the US and UK during the 1960s.\nSome sources claim that the neutron flux attack was also the main design goal of the various nuclear-tipped anti-aircraft weapons like the AIM-26 Falcon and CIM-10 Bomarc. One F-102 pilot noted:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;GAR-11/AIM-26 was primarily a weapon-killer. The bomber(s, if any) was collateral damage. The weapon was proximity-fused to ensure detonation close enough so an intense flood of neutrons would result in an instantaneous nuclear reaction (NOT full-scale) in the enemy weapon's pit; rendering it incapable of functioning as designed ... [O]ur first \"neutron bombs\" were the GAR-11 and MB-1 Genie.\nIt has also been suggested that neutron flux's effects on the warhead electronics are another attack vector for ER warheads in the ABM role. Ionization greater than 50 Gray in silicon chips delivered over seconds to minutes will degrade the function of semiconductors for long periods. However, while such attacks might be useful against guidance systems, which used relatively advanced electronics, in the ABM role, these components have long ago separated from the warheads by the time they come within range of the interceptors. The electronics in the warheads themselves tend to be very simple, and hardening them was one of the many issues studied in the 1960s.\nLithium-6 hydride (Li6H) is cited as being used as a countermeasure to reduce the vulnerability and \"harden\" nuclear warheads from the effects of externally generated neutrons. Radiation hardening of the warhead's electronic components as a countermeasure to high altitude neutron warheads somewhat reduces the range that a neutron warhead could successfully cause an unrecoverable glitch by the \"transient radiation effects on electronics\" (TREE) effects.\nAt very high altitudes, at the edge of the atmosphere and above it, another effect comes into play. At lower altitudes, the X-rays generated by the bomb are absorbed by the air and have mean free paths on the order of meters. But as the air thins out, the X-rays can travel further, eventually outpacing the area of effect of the neutrons. In exoatmospheric explosions, this can be on the order of in radius. In this sort of attack, it is the X-rays promptly delivering energy on the warhead surface that is the active mechanism; the rapid ablation (or \"blowoff\") of the surface creates shock waves that can break up the warhead.\nUse as an area denial weapon.\nIn November 2012, British Labour peer Lord Gilbert suggested that multiple enhanced radiation reduced blast (ERRB) warheads could be detonated in the mountain region of the Afghanistan-Pakistan border to prevent infiltration. He proposed to warn the inhabitants to evacuate, then irradiate the area, making it unusable and impassable. Used in this manner, the neutron bomb(s), regardless of burst height, would release neutron activated casing materials used in the bomb, and depending on burst height, create radioactive soil activation products.\nIn much the same fashion as the area denial effect resulting from fission product (the substances that make up most fallout) contamination in an area following a conventional surface-burst nuclear explosion, as considered in the Korean War by Douglas MacArthur, it would thus be a form of radiological warfare\u2014with the difference that neutron bombs produce half, or less, of the quantity of fission products relative to the same-yield pure fission bomb. Radiological warfare with neutron bombs that rely on fission primaries would thus still produce fission fallout, albeit a comparatively \"cleaner\" and shorter-lasting version of it in the area than if air bursts were used, as little to no fission products would be deposited on the direct immediate area, instead becoming diluted global fallout.\nA militarily useful use of a neutron bomb with respect to area denial would be to encase it in a thick shell of material that could be neutron activated, and use a surface burst. In this manner, the neutron bomb would be turned into a \"salted bomb\"; for example, zinc-64, produced as a byproduct of depleted zinc oxide enrichment, would when neutron activated become zinc-65, which is a gamma emitter with a half-life of 244 days.\nHypothetical effects of a pure fusion bomb.\nWith considerable overlap between the two devices, the prompt radiation effects of a pure fusion weapon would similarly be much higher than that of a pure-fission device: approximately twice the initial radiation output of current standard fission\u2013fusion-based weapons. In common with all neutron bombs that must presently derive a small percentage of trigger energy from fission, in any given yield, a 100% pure fusion bomb would likewise generate a smaller atmospheric blast wave than a \"pure\"-fission bomb. The latter fission device has a higher kinetic energy-ratio per unit of reaction energy released, which is most notable in the comparison with the D-T fusion reaction. A larger percentage of the energy from a D-T fusion reaction is inherently put into uncharged neutron generation as opposed to charged particles, such as the alpha particle of the D-T reaction, the primary species, that is most responsible for the coulomb explosion/fireball.\nList of US neutron weapons.\nAnti-ballistic missile warheads\nBallistic missile warheads\nArtillery\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The first volume in the series was published in paperback by Puffin in 1982.\nThe series distinguished itself by mixing Choose Your Own Adventure\u2013style storytelling with a dice-based role-playing element included within the books themselves. The caption on many of the covers claimed each title was an adventure \"in which YOU are the hero!\" The majority of the titles followed a fantasy theme, although science fiction, post-apocalyptic, superhero, and modern horror gamebooks were also published. The popularity of the series led to the creation of merchandise such as action figures, board games, role-playing game systems, magazines, novels, and video games.\nPuffin ended the series in 1995, but the rights to the series were eventually purchased by Wizard Books in 2002. Wizard published new editions of the original books and also commissioned six new books over two series, ending in 2012. The rights were then acquired by Scholastic in 2017, which has since published four new titles and reissued thirteen of the original books with new artwork.\nOverview.\nThe main text of each gamebook does not progress in a linear fashion, but rather is divided into a series of numbered sections (usually 400, though a few are shorter or longer). Beginning at the first section, the reader typically must pick one of a series of options provided by the text, each option being detailed at a separate non-sequential numbered section (e.g. the reader may be presented with a choice to turn from section 1 directly to either section 83 or section 180) which in turn provides an outcome for the option chosen. The book continues in this fashion until their character is killed in combat, is stopped by the story, or completes the story. \"\"Fighting Fantasy\" gamebooks empower the reader, who felt the anxiety or joy of being fantasy heroes themselves \u2013 they lived or died by their decisions. And if at first you don\u2019t succeed, try and try again,\" said Ian Livingstone of the format.\nThe typical \"Fighting Fantasy\" gamebook tasks players with completing a quest. A successful play usually ends with the player reaching the final numbered section of the book. In some cases this can only be achieved by obtaining various story items (e.g. gems in \"Deathtrap Dungeon\"); many of the titles only feature one path to the solution.\nAll \"Fighting Fantasy\" gamebooks are illustrated, including full-page pieces and smaller, repeated images scattered throughout the book as breaks or space fillers between sections. Regular contributors (excluding Scholastic editions) included Les Edwards, Terry Oakes, Russ Nicholson, Leo Hartas, Ian Miller, John Blanche, Martin McKenna, and Iain McCaig.\nSystem.\nEach \"Fighting Fantasy\" gamebook requires the reader to create their character, randomly assigning scores to three statistics (skill, stamina, and luck). These, in conjunction with rolling six-sided dice, are used to resolve skill challenges and the combat sections. Some titles use additional statistics or conflict resolution mechanics; most also require the reader to keep an inventory of items.\nSetting.\nMost early \"Fighting Fantasy\" titles were set in locations later revealed to be on the same continent called Allansia. Later a whole world named Titan was developed, with subsequent gamebooks set on three main continents\u2014Allansia, Khul and the Old World. Other titles are set in unrelated fantasy, horror, modern day, and sci-fi environments.\nPublication history.\nIn 1980, Steve Jackson (not to be confused with the US-based game designer of the same name) and Ian Livingstone attended a Games Day, and after meeting with a Penguin Books editor Geraldine Cook decided to create a series of single-player gamebooks. Their first submission, \"The Magic Quest\", was a short adventure intended to demonstrate the style of game. \"The Magic Quest\" was eventually accepted by Penguin, although the authors devoted a further six months to expanding and improving upon their original concept.\nPuffin Books (1982\u20131995).\nThe result was \"The Warlock of Firetop Mountain\" and, after several rewrites, the book was accepted and published in 1982 under Penguin's children's imprint, Puffin Books. Following the success of this title, Jackson and Livingstone began writing individually to create additional \"Fighting Fantasy\" gamebooks.\nThis series was published under Puffin's newly-created \"Adventure Gamebooks\" banner, which eventually would hold not only the \"Fighting Fantasy\" series, but \"The Cretan Chronicles\" trilogy, the \"Starlight Adventures\" series, and the individual role-playing game \"Maelstrom\" as well.\nIn 1983, \"The Citadel of Chaos\" and \"The Forest of Doom\" were published, by Jackson and Livingstone respectively. Four more titles quickly followed: \"Starship Traveller\" (the first title with a science fiction setting), \"City of Thieves\", \"Deathtrap Dungeon\", and \"Island of the Lizard King\"; Jackson writing one and Livingstone writing three. In 1984, a decision was made to hire additional writers to expand the series more quickly: Steve Jackson (the U.S.-based founder and owner of Steve Jackson Games) was the first, followed by others such as Andrew Chapman, Carl Sargent (aka Keith Martin), Marc Gascoigne, and Peter Darvill-Evans. Jackson and Livingstone, however, continued to be involved and approved all cover and internal illustrations within the UK.\nJackson wrote a self-contained four-part series titled \"Steve Jackson's Sorcery!\" (1983-1985), which combined the use of combat and sorcery, and introduced the continent later known as the Old World. These featured dice images at the bottom of each page, making it possible for the player to randomly flip through the pages for the equivalent of a dice roll (the \"Fighting Fantasy\" titles published by Wizard Books used the same device).\nAndrew Chapman and Martin Allen also wrote a two-book, two-player adventure titled \"Clash of the Princes\" (1986). There were also several supplemental books produced that provided more information about the \"Fighting Fantasy\" universe, including a comprehensive bestiary of monsters and a sample adventure.\nAlthough the \"Fighting Fantasy\" titles had successful sales the increasing dominance of video games in the 1990s caused a gradual decline. The series was scheduled to conclude with \"Return to Firetop Mountain\" (book 50, Livingstone, 1992), but due to strong sales of that volume, ten more books were scheduled. Nine were published, the series ending with \"Curse of the Mummy\" (1995). \"Bloodbones\", the tenth scheduled title (meant to have been book 60 in the series) was cancelled, but was eventually published by Wizard Books as part of their later reprinting efforts.\nWizard Books.\nSeries 1 (2002\u20132007).\nIn 2002, Wizard Books acquired the rights to the \"Fighting Fantasy\" series and reprinted many of the original titles in a revised order (initially only the gamebooks actually written by Jackson and/or Livingstone were published), starting with \"The Warlock of Firetop Mountain\". They also incorporated the \"Sorcery!\" miniseries, as books 9, 11, 13, and 15. A new title, \"Eye of the Dragon\" (by Ian Livingstone) was released in 2005, followed by \"Bloodbones\" in 2006 and \"Howl of the Werewolf\" in 2007. This series used a new logo, the rationale being that the old covers did not suit the modern market.\n2007 also marked the twenty-fifth anniversary of \"Fighting Fantasy\", and to commemorate the event Wizard Books published a special hardcover edition of \"The Warlock of Firetop Mountain\" that used the original 1982 cover image and contained extra material such as the dungeon solution and a commentary on \"Fighting Fantasy\" by Livingstone. This series concluded that same year, ending with 29 books.\nSeries 2 (2009\u20132012).\nWizard Books then began again with a new series of reprints in 2009, again featuring a different cover art style, and again starting with \"The Warlock of Firetop Mountain\". These books were physically larger than prior releases, being produced in B-format (like the original \"Advanced Fighting Fantasy\" volumes). Three other original titles were added during this run, including \"Blood of the Zombies\" by Ian Livingstone to celebrate the thirtieth anniversary in 2012. This series was 17 books long, although \"Blood of the Zombies\", the last volume released, is unnumbered and packaged differently than the rest.\nScholastic Books (2017\u2013).\nA new \"Fighting Fantasy\" book by Livingstone, \"The Port of Peril\", was published in August 2017 by Scholastic in celebration of the 35th anniversary of the series. Scholastic also released five of the original books. Instead of reusing the original artwork or its style, Scholastic commissioned new artwork. In April 2018, a further six titles were published, including a new adventure by author Charlie Higson, entitled \"The Gates of Death\". Three more titles were published in September 2019, including Livingstone's new adventure \"Assassins of Allansia\". In October 2020, two new titles were published, including a new adventure entitled \"Crystal of Storms\", the first in the series by a female author, Rhianna Pratchett. In September 2022, two more new titles were published, one by Steve Jackson (\"Secrets of Salamonis\") and one by Ian Livingstone (\"Shadow of the Giants\"), in celebration of the series' 40th anniversary. In September 2024, a new title by Ian Livingstone, \"The Dungeon on Blood Island\", was released.\nUnited States.\n\"Fighting Fantasy\" was published in the United States by Laurel Leaf, an imprint of Dell Publishing, beginning in November of 1983. These U.S. versions featured a new cover design, with the first eleven books using a white background for their covers and books 12 through 21 using a black background. Initially these editions had new cover illustrations by Richard Corben (books 1 through 7) and Richard Courtney (books 8 through 13), until 1986 when with \"Temple of Terror\" (book 14) the original Puffin Books cover illustration were used till the range ended with book 21, \"Trial of Champions\". During this run, \"House of Hell\" was re-titled \"House of Hades\".\nIn October 2003, iBooks of New York began republishing the books, beginning with the first two (\"The Warlock of Firetop Mountain\" and \"The Citadel of Chaos\"). iBooks filled for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in February 2006.\nIn October 2024, Steve Jackson Games announced that it had secured the U.S. rights to publish \"Fighting Fantasy\", with the first books scheduled to appear in \"early 2025\" in two waves of five books each.\nOther media.\nPrinted.\n\"Warlock\" magazine (first published by Puffin Books and later Games Workshop) provided additional information on the \"Fighting Fantasy\" universe, and each issue featured a short gamebook adventure, new rules, monsters, reviews and comic strips. It was published from 1983 to 1986 and ran for 13 issues in the UK. It was also published in other countries, and continued in Japan until 1997.\nIn 1984, Jackson published a roleplaying game, \"Fighting Fantasy \u2013 The Introductory Role-playing Game\". A second game was published in 1989: \"Advanced Fighting Fantasy\" (AFF). AFF was re-released as a new and further expanded edition by Arion Games in 2011.\nIn 1985, Jackson wrote a picture gamebook with the title \"Tasks of Tantalon\", in which the player was required to solve a series of puzzles which were presented as large, full-colour pictures containing hidden clues to be located and assembled.\n\"The Warlock of Firetop Mountain\" (1986) and \"Legend of Zagor\" (1993) were released as board games by Games Workshop and Parker Brothers respectively.\nBetween 1989 and 1994, seven novels were published based on \"Fighting Fantasy\", written by Steve Jackson, Marc Gascoigne, Ian Livingstone, and Carl Sargent.\nIn 1992, the \"Fighting Fantasy 10th Anniversary Yearbook\" (a diary with articles, trivia and a gamebook) was published.\nIn 2003, Jamie Wallis (not to be confused with James Wallis) adapted eight \"Fighting Fantasy\" and \"Sorcery!\" gamebooks to the D20 System. These adventures were published by Myriador (now defunct, though PDFs are still available for purchase from Greywood Publishing via third-party online retailers).\nA comic series based on \"Freeway Fighter\" was published by Titan Comics in May 2017.\nAudio.\nIn September 2017, a series of audio dramas based on classic \"Fighting Fantasy\" titles was launched by FoxYason Productions at Fighting Fantasy Fest 2, starting with \"The Warlock of Firetop Mountain: The Hero's Quest\". A boxset of four more titles was released in 2018.\nVideo games.\nSeveral \"Fighting Fantasy\" titles have been released as video games, including seven \"Fighting Fantasy\" titles (\"The Warlock of Firetop Mountain\", \"The Citadel of Chaos\", \"The Forest of Doom\", \"Temple of Terror\", \"Seas of Blood\", \"Appointment with F.E.A.R.\" and \"Rebel Planet\") for the Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, BBC, and Sinclair ZX Spectrum (1984) and \"Deathtrap Dungeon\" for the PC and PlayStation by Eidos Interactive (1998). On 18 August 2011 an adaption of \"Talisman of Death\" was released by UK developer Laughing Jackal for the \"PlayStation Minis\" platform (playable on the PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 3).\nCambridge-based studio Inkle released another interactive version of \"The Shamutanti Hills\" for iOS in May 2013, and has since gone on to release all four parts of Sorcery! on iOS, Android, Windows and Mac.\nThe video game \"The Warlock of Firetop Mountain: Goblin Scourge Edition\" was released by Tin Man Games for the Nintendo Switch on 13 September 2018.\nTin Man Games has also released the \"Fighting Fantasy Classics\" video game for Windows. \"Bloodbones\" is available for free and other titles are available as paid DLC.\nNomad Games released Deathtrap Dungeon Trilogy for the Nintendo Switch in 2019.\nMobile.\nOn 5 December 2006, it was announced that Jackson and Livingstone were planning to release a new series of handheld games based on \"Fighting Fantasy\" for Nintendo DS and Sony's PSP. The first of these, \"\", was released for the DS in the United States on 25 November 2009, and for the Apple iPhone and iPod in early January 2010.\nOn 10 February 2011 an Amazon Kindle edition of \"The Warlock of Firetop Mountain\" was launched by UK developer Worldweaver Ltd, for the US market. \"Warlock\" and four other gamebooks were released on iOS by Big Blue Bubble, but were removed from the app store in 2012 when they lost the licence.\nAustralian game developers Tin Man Games have since published several iOS and Android versions of \"Fighting Fantasy\" books, including \"Blood of the Zombies\", \"House of Hell\", \"Forest of Doom\", \"Island of the Lizard King\" and \"Starship Traveller\", and an iOS version of the first part of the Sorcery! series was released by Bright Al Ltd in 2010.\n\"Inkle's Sorcery! series\" is available on iOS, Android, Windows and Mac.\nReception.\nIn March 1983, the top three entries of the Sunday \"Times\" bestseller list were occupied by \"Fighting Fantasy\" books. The series sold 20 million copies in the 80s and 90s.\n\"Fighting Fantasy\" was ranked 47th in the 1996 reader poll of \"Arcane\" magazine to determine the 50 most popular roleplaying games of all time. The UK magazine's editor Paul Pettengale commented: \"To say that it is basic would be a huge understatement \u2013 \"Fighting Fantasy\" has just a couple of stats from which a character is created, and combat is a simple case of rolling six-sided dice, pitching one creature's stats against another. It's fun, quick and easy, which explains its popularity.\"\nMoral panic.\nThe books were published with illustrations from Games Workshop which, though something Puffin was resistant to accept, Ian Livingstone credits as part of the series' success. However, partially as a result of the covers, the game, along with \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\", became the subject of a moral panic. The Evangelical Alliance issued a warning that the books would lead to players interacting with the devil, while parents reported that after reading their children developed supernatural powers, including one mother who reported that her child started to fly. When asked about the controversy, Jackson replied that they were very grateful for it, as it helped their sales figures. Game historian Stu Horvath commented \"The moral panic didn't dent sales. \"The Warlock of Firetop Mountain\" and the \"Fighting Fantasy\" series proved to be a massive on-ramp for bringing new players into the RPG hobby, particularly in the British commonwealth ... \"Firetop Mountain\" alone was reprinted five times in 1982, ten times in 1983, and seven more in 1984, eventually selling well over two million copies and inspiring a popular board game to boot.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The National Academies also serve as public policy advisors, research institutes, think tanks, and public administration consultants on issues of public importance or on request by the government.\nThe National Research Council, National Academy of Engineering, and National Academy of Medicine began as activities of the National Academy of Sciences until they were reorganized in 2015 into units of the current National Academies while maintaining the charter status and corporate successorship of the original National Academy of Sciences.\nNow jointly governed by all three academies, the NRC produces some 200 publications annually which are published by the National Academies Press. The reports produced by the National Academies have been characterized as reflective of scientific consensus.\nHistory.\nThe US National Academy of Sciences was created by an Act of Incorporation dated March 3, 1863, which was signed by then President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln. The Act stated that \"... the Academy shall, whenever called upon by any department of the Government, investigate, examine, experiment, and report upon any subject of science or art. ... \" With the American civil war raging, the new academy was presented with few problems to solve, but it did address matters of \"... coinage, weights and measures, iron ship hulls, and the purity of whiskey ...\"\nAll subsequently affiliated organizations have been created under this same overall congressional charter, including the two younger academies, National Academy of Engineering (NAE) (created in 1964) and NAM (created as the Institute of Medicine in 1970 and rechartered as NAM in 2015).\nUnder this same charter, the National Research Council was created in 1916. On June 19 of that year, then US President Woodrow Wilson requested that the National Academy of Sciences organize a \"National Research Council\". The purpose of the council (at first called the National Research Foundation) was in part to foster and encourage \"the increased use of scientific research in the development of American industries ... the employment of scientific methods in strengthening the national defense ... and such other applications of science as will promote the national security and welfare.\"\nAt the time, the academy's effort to support national defense readiness, the Committee on Nitric Acid Supply, was approved by Secretary of War Newton D. Baker. Nitric acid was the substance basic in the making of propellants such as cordite, high explosives, dyes, fertilizers, and other products but availability was limited due to World War I. The NRC, through its committee, recommended importing Chilean saltpeter and the construction of four new ordnance plants. These recommendations were accepted by the War Department in June 1917, although the plants were not completed prior to the end of the war. &lt;br&gt; \nIn 1918, Wilson formalized the NRC's existence under Executive Order 2859. Wilson's order declared the function of the NRC to be in general:\n\"(T)o stimulate research in the mathematical. physical, and biological sciences. and in the application of these sciences to engineering, agriculture. medicine. and other useful arts. with the object of increasing knowledge, of strengthening the national defense, and of contributing in other ways to the public welfare.\"\nDuring World War I, when the United States was at war, the NRC operated as the Department of Science and Research of the Council of National Defense as well as the Science and Research Division of the United States Army Signal Corps. When war was first declared, the council had organized committees on anti-submarine and gas warfare.\nOn June 1, 1917, the council convened a meeting of scientific representatives of the United Kingdom and France with interested parties from the U.S. on the subject of submarine detection. Another meeting with the British and French was held in Paris in October 1918, at which more details of their work were disclosed. As a result of these meetings, the NRC recommended that scientists be brought together to work on the problems associated with submarine detection. Due to the success of council-directed research in producing a sound-based method of detecting submarines, as well as other military innovations, the NRC was retained at the end of the war, though it was gradually decoupled from the military.\nNRC's Articles of Organization have been changed only three times: in 1956, January 1993, and July 2015.\nThe Academies.\nThe National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, and National Academy of Medicine are honorary membership organizations, each of which has its own governing Council, and each of which elects its own new members. The membership\nof the three academies totals more than 6,300 scientists, engineers, and health professionals. New members for each organization are elected annually by existing members, based on their distinguished and continuing achievements in original research. By the terms of the original 1863 Congressional charter, the three academies serve \"pro bono\" as \"advisers to the nation on science, engineering, and medicine.\"\nProgram units.\nThe program units, formerly known as the National Research Council, are collectively the operating arm of the three academies for the purpose of providing objective policy advice. Although separately chartered (see above), it falls legally under the overall charter of the National Academy of Sciences, whose ultimate fiduciary body is the NAS Council. In actual practice, the NAS Council delegates governing authority to a Governing Board of the National Research Council that is chaired jointly by the presidents of the three academies, with additional members chosen by them or specified in the charters of the academies.\nUnder this three-academy umbrella, the program units produce reports that shape policies, inform public opinion, and advance the pursuit of science, engineering, and medicine.\nThere are seven major divisions: Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education, Division of Earth and Life Studies, Division of Engineering and Physical Sciences, Health and Medicine Division, Policy and Global Affairs Division, Transportation Research Board, and the Gulf Research Program.\nDivision of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education (DBASSE).\nUnits of the Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education.\nSource:\nDivision on Earth and Life Studies (DELS).\nUnits of the Division on Earth and Life Studies.\nSource:\nDivision on Engineering and Physical Sciences (DEPS).\nThe Division on Engineering and Physical Sciences has activities organized around: \nUnits of the Division on Engineering and Physical Sciences.\nSource:\nGulf Research Program (GRP).\nUnits of the GRP.\nSource:\nPolicy and Global Affairs Division (PGA).\nUnits of the Policy and Global Affairs Division.\nSource:\nTransportation Research Board (TRB).\nUnits of the Transportation Research Board.\nSource:\nStudy process.\nThe National Academies attempt to obtain authoritative, objective, and scientifically balanced answers to difficult questions of national importance. Top scientists, engineers, health professionals, and other experts (not limited to those in academies membership) are enlisted to address the scientific and technical aspects of some of society's problems. These experts are volunteers who serve on study committees that are convened to answer specific sets of questions. All committee members serve without pay.\nNASEM does not perform original research; rather it provides independent advice. Federal agencies are the primary financial sponsors of the Academies' work; additional studies are funded by state agencies, foundations, other private sponsors, and the National Academies endowment. The external sponsors have no control over the conduct or results of a study, once the statement of task and budget are finalized. Study committees gather information from many sources in public meetings but deliberate in private in order to avoid political, special interest, and sponsor influence.\nAll reports go through an extensive external review facilitated by the internal Report Review Committee (also consisting of members from the NAS, NAE, and NAM).\nThrough this study process, the National Academies produce around 200 reports each year. Recent reports addressed the obesity epidemic, the use of forensics in the courtroom, invasive plants, pollinator collapse, underage drinking, the Hubble Space Telescope, vaccine safety, the hydrogen economy, transportation safety, climate change, and homeland security. Many reports influence policy decisions; some are instrumental in enabling new research programs; others provide independent program reviews. The National Academies Press is the publisher for the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, and makes its publications available for free online reading. The full book PDFs have been available for free download since 2011.\nThe National Academies also provide credentialed witnesses who speak before government bodies on important issues. For example, a committee chair may speak on rising mortality rates in working adults in the US to a Senate Subcommittee on Primary Health and Retirement Security, Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.\nReports.\nClimate change.\nIn 2001, the NRC published the report \"Climate Change Science: An Analysis of Some Key Questions\", which emphasized that national policy decisions made both in the near term and in the future will influence the extent of any damage suffered by vulnerable human populations and ecosystems later in this century. The report endorsed findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as representing the views of the scientific community:\nThe changes observed over the last several decades are likely mostly due to human activities, but we cannot rule out that some significant part of these changes is also a reflection of natural variability. Human-induced warming and associated sea level rise are expected to continue through the 21st century ... The IPCC's conclusion that most of the observed warming of the last 50 years is likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations accurately reflects the current[2001] thinking of the scientific community on this issue.\nIn 2013, the NRC published the report \"Abrupt Impacts of Climate Change: Anticipating Surprises\", which provided an updated look at the issue of abrupt climate change and its potential impacts. This study differed from previous treatments of abrupt changes by focusing on abrupt climate changes and also abrupt climate impacts that have the potential to severely affect the physical climate system, natural systems, or human systems, often affecting multiple interconnected areas of concern.\nSexual assault.\nIn 2013, the NRC published the report \"Estimating the Incidence of Rape and Sexual Assault\", which pointed out that approximately 80 percent of sexual assaults go unreported to law enforcement. The report recommends that the National Crime Victimization Survey adopt new approaches to interviews of rape victims, including changing the wording of questions.\nIn an article about the report, Amber Stevenson, clinical supervisor and therapist at the Nashville Sexual Assault Center, said that victim-blaming was the main issue preventing victims from coming forward: As long as we as a community continue to make victim-blaming statements, such as, \"She put herself in this situation,\"...\"She didn't fight back, she must have wanted it,\" we will continue to see rapes go unreported ... We have to stop blaming the victim. The conversation needs to shift to the person who chose to rape.\nIntegrity in research.\nThe 1992 report, \"Responsible Science: Ensuring the Integrity of the Research Process\" was updated in 2017 by the report, \"Fostering Integrity in Research:\"\n ... as experience has accumulated with various forms of research misconduct, detrimental research practices, and other forms of misconduct, as subsequent empirical research has revealed more about the nature of scientific misconduct, and because technological and social changes have altered the environment in which science is conducted, it is clear that the framework established more than two decades ago needs to be updated.\nOne of the report's main concerns is that a growing percentage of recently published research turns out to be not reproducible due in part to inadequate support of standards of transparency in many fields as well as to various other detrimental research practices.\nOther programs.\nThe Christine Mirzayan Science and Technology Policy Fellowship is an annual program for recent graduate students to spend three months working in the National Academies. The Academies also administered the Marian Koshland Science Museum in downtown Washington until its closing in 2017; the Museum has since been replaced by LabX, a program of online resources and nationwide public events that aim to increase awareness of scientific and evidence-based solutions to community problems.\nRevenue.\nThe National Academies do not receive direct appropriations from the federal government; instead their revenue comes from grants and contracts of federal agencies and private sources. According to the \"New York Times\" in 2023, \"about 70 percent of the National Academies budget comes from federal funds, it also raised private donations from individuals, nonprofits and companies, including Chevron, Google, Merck, and Medtronic.\" At the time it was advising the government on opioid policy, it received $19 million from Purdue Pharma's Sackler family between 2000 and 2021.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "37636", "revid": "1462822", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37636", "title": "Encephalitis", "text": "Inflammation of the brain\nMedical condition&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Infobox/styles-images.css\" /&gt;\nEncephalitis (, ) is inflammation of the brain. The severity can be variable with symptoms including reduction or alteration in consciousness, aphasia, headache, fever, confusion, a stiff neck, and vomiting. Complications may include seizures, hallucinations, trouble speaking, memory problems, and problems with hearing.\nCauses of encephalitis include viruses such as herpes simplex virus and rabies virus as well as bacteria, fungi, or parasites. Other causes include autoimmune diseases and certain medications. In many cases the cause remains unknown. Risk factors include a weak immune system. Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms and supported by blood tests, medical imaging, and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid.\nCertain types are preventable with vaccines. Treatment may include antiviral medications (such as acyclovir), anticonvulsants, and corticosteroids. Treatment generally takes place in hospital. Some people require artificial respiration. Once the immediate problem is under control, rehabilitation may be required. In 2015, encephalitis was estimated to have affected 4.3\u00a0million people and resulted in 150,000 deaths worldwide.\nSigns and symptoms.\nAdults with encephalitis present with acute onset of fever, headache, confusion, and sometimes seizures. Younger children or infants may present with irritability, poor appetite and fever. Neurological examinations usually reveal a drowsy or confused person. Stiff neck, due to the irritation of the meninges covering the brain, indicates that the patient has either meningitis or meningoencephalitis.\nLimbic encephalitis.\nLimbic encephalitis refers to inflammatory disease confined to the limbic system of the brain. The clinical presentation often includes disorientation, disinhibition, memory loss, seizures, and behavioral anomalies. MRI imaging reveals T2 hyperintensity in the structures of the medial temporal lobes, and in some cases, other limbic structures. Some cases of limbic encephalitis are of autoimmune origin.\nEncephalitis lethargica.\nEncephalitis lethargica is identified by high fever, headache, delayed physical response, and lethargy. Individuals can exhibit upper body weakness, muscular pains, and tremors, though the cause of encephalitis lethargica is not currently known. From 1917 to 1928, an epidemic of encephalitis lethargica occurred worldwide.\nCause.\nIn 30%-40% of encephalitis cases, the etiology remains unknown.\nViral.\nViral infections are the usual cause of infectious encephalitis. Viral encephalitis can occur either as a direct effect of an acute infection, or as one of the sequelae of a latent infection. The majority of viral cases of encephalitis have an unknown cause; however, the most common identifiable cause of viral encephalitis is from herpes simplex infection. Other causes of acute viral encephalitis are rabies virus, poliovirus, and measles virus.\nAdditional possible viral causes are arboviral flavivirus (St. Louis encephalitis, West Nile virus), bunyavirus (La Crosse strain), arenavirus (lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus), reovirus (Colorado tick virus), and henipavirus infections. The Powassan virus is a rare cause of encephalitis.\nBacterial.\nIt can be caused by a bacterial infection, such as bacterial meningitis, or may be a complication of a current infectious disease such as syphilis (secondary encephalitis).\nOther bacterial pathogens, like \"Mycoplasma\" and those causing rickettsial disease, cause inflammation of the meninges and consequently encephalitis. Lyme disease or \"Bartonella henselae\" may also cause encephalitis.\nOther infectious causes.\nCertain parasitic or protozoal infestations, such as toxoplasmosis and malaria can also cause encephalitis in people with compromised immune systems.\nThe rare but typically deadly forms of encephalitis, primary amoebic meningoencephalitis and Granulomatous amoebic encephalitis, are caused by free-living amoeba.\nAutoimmune encephalitis.\nAutoimmune encephalitis signs can include catatonia, psychosis, abnormal movements, and autonomic dysregulation. Antibody-mediated anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor encephalitis and Rasmussen encephalitis are examples of autoimmune encephalitis.\nAnti-NMDA receptor encephalitis is the most common autoimmune form, and is accompanied by ovarian teratoma in 58 percent of affected women 18\u201345 years of age.\nAnother autoimmune cause includes acute disseminated encephalitis, a demyelinating disease which primarily affects children.\nDiagnosis.\nPeople should only be diagnosed with encephalitis if they have a decreased or altered level of consciousness, lethargy, or personality change for at least twenty-four hours without any other explainable cause. Diagnosing encephalitis is done via a variety of tests:\nPrevention.\nVaccination is available against tick-borne and Japanese encephalitis and should be considered for at-risk individuals. Post-infectious encephalomyelitis complicating smallpox vaccination is avoidable, for all intents and purposes, as smallpox is nearly eradicated. Contraindication to Pertussis immunization should be observed in patients with encephalitis.\nTreatment.\nAn ideal drug to treat brain infection should be small, moderately lipophilic at pH of 7.4, low level of plasma protein binding, volume of distribution of litre per kg, does not have strong affinity towards binding with P-glycoprotein, or other efflux pumps on the surface of the blood\u2013brain barrier. Some drugs such as isoniazid, pyrazinamide, linezolid, metronidazole, fluconazole, and some fluoroquinolones have good penetration of the blood brain barrier. Treatment (which is based on supportive care) is as follows:\nPyrimethamine-based maintenance therapy is often used to treat toxoplasmic encephalitis (TE), which is caused by \"Toxoplasma gondii\" and can be life-threatening for people with weak immune systems. The use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), in conjunction with the established pyrimethamine-based maintenance therapy, decreases the chance of relapse in patients with HIV and TE from approximately 18% to 11%. This is a significant difference as relapse may impact the severity and prognosis of disease and result in an increase in healthcare expenditure.\nThe effectiveness of intravenous immunoglobulin for the management of childhood encephalitis is unclear. Systematic reviews have been unable to draw firm conclusions because of a lack of randomised double-blind studies with sufficient numbers of patients and sufficient follow-up. There is the possibility of a benefit of intravenous immunoglobulin for some forms of childhood encephalitis on some indicators such as length of hospital stay, time to stop spasms, time to regain consciousness, and time to resolution of neuropathic symptoms and fever. Intravenous immunoglobulin for Japanese encephalitis appeared to have no benefit when compared with placebo (pretend) treatment.\nPrognosis.\nIdentification of poor prognostic factors include cerebral edema, status epilepticus, and thrombocytopenia. In contrast, a normal encephalogram at the early stages of diagnosis is associated with high rates of survival.\nEpidemiology.\nThe number of new cases a year of acute encephalitis in Western countries is 7.4 cases per 100,000 people per year. In tropical countries, the incidence is 6.34 per 100,000 people per year. The number of cases of encephalitis has not changed much over time, with about 250,000 cases a year from 2005 to 2015 in the US. Approximately seven per 100,000 people were hospitalized for encephalitis in the US during this time. In 2015, encephalitis was estimated to have affected 4.3\u00a0million people and resulted in 150,000 deaths worldwide. Herpes simplex encephalitis has an incidence of 2\u20134 per million of the population per year.\nTerminology.\nEncephalitis with meningitis is known as meningoencephalitis, while encephalitis with involvement of the spinal cord is known as encephalomyelitis.\nThe word is from Ancient Greek , 'brain', composed of , , 'in' and , , 'head', and the medical suffix \"-itis\" 'inflammation'.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "37637", "revid": "50868424", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37637", "title": "Nucleophile", "text": "Chemical species that donates an electron pair\nIn chemistry, a nucleophile is a chemical species that forms bonds by donating an electron pair. All molecules and ions with a free pair of electrons or at least one pi bond can act as nucleophiles. Because nucleophiles donate electrons, they are Lewis bases.\n\"Nucleophilic\" describes the affinity of a nucleophile to bond with positively charged atomic nuclei. Nucleophilicity, sometimes referred to as nucleophile strength, refers to a substance's nucleophilic character and is often used to compare the affinity of atoms. Neutral nucleophilic reactions with solvents such as alcohols and water are named solvolysis. Nucleophiles may take part in nucleophilic substitution, whereby a nucleophile becomes attracted to a full or partial positive charge, and nucleophilic addition. Nucleophilicity is closely related to basicity. The difference between the two is, that basicity is a thermodynamic property (i.e. relates to an equilibrium state), but nucleophilicity is a kinetic property, which relates to rates of certain chemical reactions.\nHistory and etymology.\nThe terms \"nucleophile\" and \"electrophile\" were introduced by Christopher Kelk Ingold in 1933, replacing the terms \"anionoid\" and \"cationoid\" proposed earlier by A. J. Lapworth in 1925. The word nucleophile is derived from nucleus and the Greek word \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, philos, meaning friend.\nProperties.\nIn general, in a group across the periodic table, the more basic the ion (the higher the pKa of the conjugate acid) the more reactive it is as a nucleophile. Within a series of nucleophiles with the same attacking element (e.g. oxygen), the order of nucleophilicity will follow basicity. Sulfur is in general a better nucleophile than oxygen.\nNucleophilicity.\nMany schemes attempting to quantify relative nucleophilic strength have been devised. The following empirical data have been obtained by measuring reaction rates for many reactions involving many nucleophiles and electrophiles. Nucleophiles displaying the so-called alpha effect are usually omitted in this type of treatment.\nSwain\u2013Scott equation.\nThe first such attempt is found in the Swain\u2013Scott equation derived in 1953:\nformula_1\nThis free-energy relationship relates the pseudo first order reaction rate constant (in water at 25\u00a0\u00b0C), \"k\", of a reaction, normalized to the reaction rate, \"k\"0, of a standard reaction with water as the nucleophile, to a nucleophilic constant \"n\" for a given nucleophile and a substrate constant \"s\" that depends on the sensitivity of a substrate to nucleophilic attack (defined as 1 for methyl bromide).\nThis treatment results in the following values for typical nucleophilic anions: acetate 2.7, chloride 3.0, azide 4.0, hydroxide 4.2, aniline 4.5, iodide 5.0, and thiosulfate 6.4. Typical substrate constants are 0.66 for ethyl tosylate, 0.77 for \u03b2-propiolactone, 1.00 for 2,3-epoxypropanol, 0.87 for benzyl chloride, and 1.43 for benzoyl chloride.\nThe equation predicts that, in a nucleophilic displacement on benzyl chloride, the azide anion reacts 3000 times faster than water.\nRitchie equation.\nThe Ritchie equation, derived in 1972, is another free-energy relationship:\nformula_2\nwhere \"N\"+ is the nucleophile dependent parameter and \"k\"0 the reaction rate constant for water. In this equation, a substrate-dependent parameter like \"s\" in the Swain\u2013Scott equation is absent. The equation states that two nucleophiles react with the same relative reactivity regardless of the nature of the electrophile, which is in violation of the reactivity\u2013selectivity principle. For this reason, this equation is also called the \"constant selectivity relationship\".\nIn the original publication the data were obtained by reactions of selected nucleophiles with selected electrophilic carbocations such as tropylium or diazonium cations:\nor (not displayed) ions based on malachite green. Many other reaction types have since been described.\nTypical Ritchie N+ values (in methanol) are: 0.5 for methanol, 5.9 for the cyanide anion, 7.5 for the methoxide anion, 8.5 for the azide anion, and 10.7 for the thiophenol anion. The values for the relative cation reactivities are \u22120.4 for the malachite green cation, +2.6 for the benzenediazonium cation, and +4.5 for the tropylium cation.\nMayr\u2013Patz equation.\nIn the Mayr\u2013Patz equation (1994):\nformula_3\nThe second order reaction rate constant \"k\" at 20\u00a0\u00b0C for a reaction is related to a nucleophilicity parameter \"N\", an electrophilicity parameter \"E\", and a nucleophile-dependent slope parameter \"s\". The constant \"s\" is defined as 1 with 2-methyl-1-pentene as the nucleophile.\nMany of the constants have been derived from reaction of so-called benzhydrylium ions as the electrophiles:\nand a diverse collection of \u03c0-nucleophiles:\nTypical E values are +6.2 for R = chlorine, +5.90 for R = hydrogen, 0 for R = methoxy and \u22127.02 for R = dimethylamine.\nTypical N values with s in parentheses are \u22124.47 (1.32) for electrophilic aromatic substitution to toluene (1), \u22120.41 (1.12) for electrophilic addition to 1-phenyl-2-propene (2), and 0.96 (1) for addition to 2-methyl-1-pentene (3), \u22120.13 (1.21) for reaction with triphenylallylsilane (4), 3.61 (1.11) for reaction with 2-methylfuran (5), +7.48 (0.89) for reaction with isobutenyltributylstannane (6) and +13.36 (0.81) for reaction with the enamine 7.\nThe range of organic reactions also include SN2 reactions:\nWith E = \u22129.15 for the \"S-methyldibenzothiophenium ion\", typical nucleophile values N (s) are 15.63 (0.64) for piperidine, 10.49 (0.68) for methoxide, and 5.20 (0.89) for water. In short, nucleophilicities towards sp2 or sp3 centers follow the same pattern.\nUnified equation.\nIn an effort to unify the above described equations the Mayr equation is rewritten as:\n\"formula_4\"\nwith sE the electrophile-dependent slope parameter and sN the nucleophile-dependent slope parameter. This equation can be rewritten in several ways:\nformula_5\n\"or the original Scott\u2013Swain equation written as:\"\nformula_6\nformula_7\nor the original Ritchie equation written as:\nformula_8\nTypes.\nExamples of nucleophiles are anions such as Cl\u2212, or a compound with a lone pair of electrons such as NH3 (ammonia) and PR3.\nIn the example below, the oxygen of the hydroxide ion donates an electron pair to form a new chemical bond with the carbon at the end of the bromopropane molecule. The bond between the carbon and the bromine then undergoes heterolytic fission, with the bromine atom taking the donated electron and becoming the bromide ion (Br\u2212), because a SN2 reaction occurs by backside attack. This means that the hydroxide ion attacks the carbon atom from the other side, exactly opposite the bromine ion. Because of this backside attack, SN2 reactions result in an inversion of the configuration of the electrophile. If the electrophile is chiral, it typically maintains its chirality, though the SN2 product's absolute configuration is flipped as compared to that of the original electrophile.\nAmbident nucleophile.\nAn ambident nucleophile is one that can attack from two or more places, resulting in two or more products. For example, the thiocyanate ion (SCN\u2212) may attack from either the sulfur or the nitrogen. For this reason, the SN2 reaction of an alkyl halide with SCN\u2212 often leads to a mixture of an alkyl thiocyanate (R-SCN) and an alkyl isothiocyanate (R-NCS). Similar considerations apply in the Kolbe nitrile synthesis.\nHalogens.\nWhile the halogens are not nucleophilic in their diatomic form (e.g. I2 is not a nucleophile), their anions are good nucleophiles. In polar, protic solvents, F\u2212 is the weakest nucleophile, and I\u2212 the strongest; this order is reversed in polar, aprotic solvents.\nCarbon.\nCarbon nucleophiles are often organometallic reagents such as those found in the Grignard reaction, Blaise reaction, Reformatsky reaction, and Barbier reaction or reactions involving organolithium reagents and acetylides. These reagents are often used to perform nucleophilic additions.\nEnols are also carbon nucleophiles. The formation of an enol is catalyzed by acid or base. Enols are ambident nucleophiles, but, in general, nucleophilic at the alpha carbon atom. Enols are commonly used in condensation reactions, including the Claisen condensation and the aldol condensation reactions.\nOxygen.\nExamples of oxygen nucleophiles are water (H2O), hydroxide anion, alcohols, alkoxide anions, hydrogen peroxide, and carboxylate anions.\nNucleophilic attack does not take place during intermolecular hydrogen bonding.\nSulfur.\nOf sulfur nucleophiles, hydrogen sulfide and its salts, thiols (RSH), thiolate anions (RS\u2212), anions of thiolcarboxylic acids (RC(O)-S\u2212), and anions of dithiocarbonates (RO-C(S)-S\u2212) and dithiocarbamates (R2N-C(S)-S\u2212) are used most often.\nIn general, \"sulfur is very nucleophilic because of its large size\", which makes it readily polarizable, and its lone pairs of electrons are readily accessible.\nNitrogen.\nNitrogen nucleophiles include ammonia, azide, amines, nitrites, hydroxylamine, hydrazine, carbazide, phenylhydrazine, semicarbazide, and amide.\nMetal centers.\nAlthough metal centers (e.g., Li+, Zn2+, Sc3+, etc.) are most commonly cationic and electrophilic (Lewis acidic) in nature, certain metal centers (particularly ones in a low oxidation state and/or carrying a negative charge) are among the strongest recorded nucleophiles and are sometimes referred to as \"supernucleophiles.\" For instance, using methyl iodide as the reference electrophile, Ph3Sn\u2013 is about 10000 times more nucleophilic than I\u2013, while the Co(I) form of vitamin B12 (vitamin B12s) is about 107 times more nucleophilic. Other supernucleophilic metal centers include low oxidation state carbonyl metalate anions (e.g., CpFe(CO)2\u2013).\nExamples.\nThe following table shows the nucleophilicity of some molecules with methanol as the solvent:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "37640", "revid": "15881234", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37640", "title": "Lumbar disc disease", "text": "Medical condition&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Infobox/styles-images.css\" /&gt;\nLumbar disc disease is the drying out of the spongy interior matrix of an intervertebral disc in the spine. Many physicians and patients use the term lumbar disc disease to encompass several different causes of back pain or sciatica. In this article, the term is used to describe a lumbar herniated disc. It is thought that lumbar disc disease causes about one-third of all back pain.\nSymptoms.\nPain, loss of muscle strength and loss of touch sensation may occur if this herniation causes the compression of the most proximal part of the nerve closely neighbouring the intervertebral disc material. Pain is in the distribution of the nerve compressed, usually down the back of the leg, side of the calf and inside of the foot (sciatica). Most commonly, the nerve root between the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae or between the fifth lumbar vertebra and first sacral segment are impinged.\nIn symptomatic cases the diagnosis should be confirmed by an MRI scan. However, in cases with slight symptoms, a faster and cheaper CT scan (although it is inferior to MRI scan) may be recommended. While a CT scan can show the bony structures in more detail, an MRI scan can better portray soft tissue.\nGenetics.\nAn inheritable gene variation may cause increased susceptibility. People with a variation in a gene that encodes the cartilage intermediate-layer protein (CILP) were 1.6 times more likely to have the disease than persons without the variation. CILP is a normal component of disc tissue. The gene variant was hypothesized to disrupt normal building and maintenance of cartilage. However, this association was not replicated in a follow-up study of Finnish and Chinese individuals.\nDiagnosis.\nDiagnosis can be made on clinical basis with MRI findings\nTreatment.\nInitial treatment in lumbar disc disease is one or two days of bedrest (although growing number of studies shows that it makes little difference) and pain relieving medications. In cases with ongoing pain despite conservative treatments, a surgical operation that will remove the compressing disc material, a microdiscectomy or discectomy may be recommended to treat a lumbar disc herniation.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The terms \"traumatic brain injury\" and \"head injury\" are often used interchangeably in the medical literature. Because head injuries cover such a broad scope of injuries, there are many causes\u2014including accidents, falls, physical assault, or traffic accidents\u2014that can cause head injuries.\nThe number of new cases is 1.7 million in the United States each year, with about 3% of these incidents leading to death. Adults have head injuries more frequently than any age group resulting from falls, motor vehicle crashes, colliding or being struck by an object, or assaults. Children, however, may experience head injuries from accidental falls or intentional causes (such as being struck or shaken) leading to hospitalization. Acquired brain injury (ABI) is a term used to differentiate brain injuries occurring after birth from injury, from a genetic disorder, or from a congenital disorder.\nUnlike a broken bone where trauma to the body is obvious, head trauma can sometimes be conspicuous or inconspicuous. In the case of an open head injury, the skull is cracked and broken by an object that makes contact with the brain. This leads to bleeding. Other obvious symptoms can be neurological in nature. The person may become sleepy, behave abnormally, lose consciousness, vomit, develop a severe headache, have mismatched pupil sizes, and/or be unable to move certain parts of the body. While these symptoms happen immediately after a head injury occurs, many problems can develop later in life. Alzheimer's disease, for example, is much more likely to develop in a person who has experienced a head injury.\nBrain damage, which is the destruction or degeneration of brain cells, is a common occurrence in those who experience a head injury. Neurotoxicity is another cause of brain damage that typically refers to selective, chemically induced neuron/brain damage.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nClassification.\nHead injuries include both injuries to the brain and those to other parts of the head, such as the scalp and skull. Head injuries can be closed or open. A closed (non-missile) head injury is where the dura mater remains intact. The skull can be fractured, but not necessarily. A penetrating head injury occurs when an object pierces the skull and breaches the dura mater. Brain injuries may be diffuse, occurring over a wide area, or focal, located in a small, specific area. A head injury may cause skull fracture, which may or may not be associated with injury to the brain. Some patients may have linear or depressed skull fractures. If intracranial hemorrhage occurs, a hematoma within the skull can put pressure on the brain. Types of intracranial hemorrhage include subdural, subarachnoid, extradural, and intraparenchymal hematoma. Craniotomy surgeries are used in these cases to lessen the pressure by draining off the blood.\nBrain injury can occur at the site of impact, but can also be at the opposite side of the skull due to a \"contrecoup\" effect (the impact to the head can cause the brain to move within the skull, causing the brain to impact the interior of the skull opposite the head-impact). While impact on the brain at the same site of injury to the skull is the coup effect. If the impact causes the head to move, the injury may be worsened, because the brain may ricochet inside the skull causing additional impacts, or the brain may stay relatively still (due to inertia) but be hit by the moving skull (both are contrecoup injuries).\nSpecific problems after head injury can include\nConcussion.\nA concussion is a form of a mild traumatic brain injury (TBI). This injury is a result due to a blow to the head that could make the person's physical, cognitive, and emotional behaviors irregular. Symptoms may include clumsiness, fatigue, confusion, nausea, blurry vision, headaches, and others. Mild concussions are associated with sequelae. Severity is measured using various concussion grading systems.\nA slightly greater injury is associated with both anterograde and retrograde amnesia (inability to remember events before or after the injury). The amount of time that the amnesia is present correlates with the severity of the injury. In all cases, the patients develop post concussion syndrome, which includes memory problems, dizziness, tiredness, sickness and depression. Cerebral concussion is the most common head injury seen in children.\nIntracranial bleeding.\nTypes of intracranial hemorrhage are roughly grouped into intra-axial and extra-axial. The hemorrhage is considered a focal brain injury; that is, it occurs in a localized spot rather than causing diffuse damage over a wider area.\nIntra-axial bleeding.\nIntra-axial hemorrhage is bleeding within the brain itself, or cerebral hemorrhage. This category includes intraparenchymal hemorrhage, or bleeding within the brain tissue, and intraventricular hemorrhage, bleeding within the brain's ventricles (particularly of premature infants). Intra-axial hemorrhages are more dangerous and harder to treat than extra-axial bleeds.\nExtra-axial bleeding.\nExtra-axial hemorrhage, bleeding that occurs within the skull but outside of the brain tissue, falls into three subtypes:\nCerebral contusion.\nCerebral contusion is bruising of the brain tissue. The piamater is not breached in contusion in contrary to lacerations. The majority of contusions occur in the frontal and temporal lobes. Complications may include cerebral edema and transtentorial herniation. The goal of treatment should be to treat the increased intracranial pressure. The prognosis is guarded.\nDiffuse axonal injury.\nDiffuse axonal injury, or DAI, usually occurs as the result of an acceleration or deceleration motion, not necessarily an impact. Axons are stretched and damaged when parts of the brain of differing density slide over one another. Prognoses vary widely depending on the extent of the damage.\nCompound head injury.\nOverlying scalp laceration and soft tissue disruption in continuity with a skull fracture constitutes \"compound head injury\", and has higher rates of infection, unfavorable neurologic outcome, delayed seizures, mortality, and duration of hospital stay.\nSigns and symptoms.\nThree categories used for classifying the severity of brain injuries are mild, moderate or severe.\nMild brain injuries.\nSymptoms of a mild brain injury include headaches, confusion, ringing ears, fatigue, changes in sleep patterns, mood or behavior. Other symptoms include trouble with memory, concentration, attention or thinking. Mental fatigue is a common debilitating experience and may not be linked by the patient to the original (minor) incident. Narcolepsy and sleep disorders are common misdiagnoses.\nModerate/severe brain injuries.\nCognitive symptoms include confusion, aggression, abnormal behavior, slurred speech, and coma or other disorders of consciousness. Physical symptoms include headaches that do not go away or worsen, vomiting or nausea, convulsions or seizures, abnormal dilation of the eyes, inability to awaken from sleep, weakness in the extremities, and a loss of coordination. In cases of severe brain injuries, the likelihood of areas with permanent disability is great, including neurocognitive deficits, delusions (often, to be specific, monothematic delusions), speech or movement problems, and intellectual disability. There may also be personality changes. The most severe cases result in coma or even persistent vegetative state.\nSymptoms in children.\nSymptoms observed in children include changes in eating habits, persistent irritability or sadness, changes in attention, disrupted sleeping habits, or loss of interest in toys.\nPresentation varies according to the injury. Some patients with head trauma stabilize and other patients deteriorate. A patient may present with or without neurological deficit. Patients with concussion may have a history of seconds to minutes unconsciousness, then normal arousal. Disturbance of vision and equilibrium may also occur. Common symptoms of head injury include coma, confusion, drowsiness, personality change, seizures, nausea and vomiting, headache and a lucid interval, during which a patient appears conscious only to deteriorate later.\nSymptoms of skull fracture can include:\nBecause brain injuries can be life-threatening, even people with apparently slight injuries, with no noticeable signs or complaints, require close observation; They have a chance for severe symptoms later on. The caretakers of those patients with mild trauma who are released from the hospital are frequently advised to rouse the patient several times during the next 12 to 24 hours to assess for worsening symptoms.\nThe Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is a tool for measuring the degree of unconsciousness and is thus a useful tool for determining the severity of the injury. The Pediatric Glasgow Coma Scale is used in young children. The widely used PECARN Pediatric Head Injury/Trauma Algorithm helps physicians weigh risk-benefit of imaging in a clinical setting given multiple factors about the patient\u2014including mechanism/location of the injury, age of the patient, and GCS score.\nLocation of brain damage predicts symptoms.\nSymptoms of brain injuries can also be influenced by the location of the injury and as a result, impairments are specific to the part of the brain affected. Lesion size is correlated with severity, recovery, and comprehension. Brain injuries often create impairment or disability that can vary greatly in severity.\nStudies show there is a correlation between brain lesion and language, speech, and category-specific disorders. Wernicke's aphasia is associated with anomia, unknowingly making up words (neologisms), and problems with comprehension. The symptoms of Wernicke's aphasia are caused by damage to the posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus.\nDamage to the Broca's area typically produces symptoms like omitting functional words (agrammatism), sound production changes, dyslexia, dysgraphia, and problems with comprehension and production. Broca's aphasia is indicative of damage to the posterior inferior frontal gyrus of the brain.\nAn impairment following damage to a region of the brain does not necessarily imply that the damaged area is wholly responsible for the cognitive process which is impaired, however. For example, in pure alexia, the ability to read is destroyed by a lesion damaging both the left visual field and the connection between the right visual field and the language areas (Broca's area and Wernicke's area). However, this does not mean someone with pure alexia is incapable of comprehending speech\u2014merely that there is no connection between their working visual cortex and language areas\u2014as is demonstrated by the fact that pure alexics can still write, speak, and even transcribe letters without understanding their meaning. Lesions to the fusiform gyrus often result in prosopagnosia, the inability to distinguish faces and other complex objects from each other. Lesions in the amygdala would eliminate the enhanced activation seen in occipital and fusiform visual areas in response to fear with the area intact. Amygdala lesions change the functional pattern of activation to emotional stimuli in regions that are distant from the amygdala.\nOther lesions to the visual cortex have different effects depending on the location of the damage. Lesions to V1, for example, can cause blindsight in different areas of the brain depending on the size of the lesion and location relative to the calcarine fissure. Lesions to V4 can cause color-blindness, and bilateral lesions to MT/V5 can cause the loss of the ability to perceive motion. Lesions to the parietal lobes may result in agnosia, an inability to recognize complex objects, smells, or shapes, or amorphosynthesis, a loss of perception on the opposite side of the body.\nCauses.\nHead injuries can be caused by a large variety of reasons. All of these causes can be put into two categories used to classify head injuries; those that occur from impact (blows) and those that occur from shaking. Common causes of head injury due to impact are motor vehicle traffic collisions, home and occupational accidents, falls, assault, and sports related accidents. Head injuries from shaking are most common amongst infants and children.\nAccording to the United States CDC, 32% of traumatic brain injuries (another, more specific, term for head injuries) are caused by falls, 10% by assaults, 16.5% by being struck by or against something, 17% by motor vehicle accidents, and 21% by other/unknown ways. In addition, the highest rate of injury is among children ages 0\u201314 and adults age 65 and older. Brain injuries that include brain damage can also be brought on by exposure to toxic chemicals, lack of oxygen, tumors, infections, and stroke. Possible causes of widespread brain damage include birth hypoxia, prolonged hypoxia (shortage of oxygen), poisoning by teratogens (including alcohol), infection, and neurological illness. Brain tumors can increase intracranial pressure, causing brain damage.\nDiagnosis.\nThere are a few methods used to diagnose a head injury. A healthcare professional will ask the patient questions revolving around the injury as well as questions to help determine in what ways the injury is affecting function. In addition to this hearing, vision, balance, and reflexes may also be assessed as an indicator of the severity of the injury. A non-contrast CT of the head should be performed immediately in all those who have sustained a moderate or severe head injury. A CT is an imaging technique that allows physicians to see inside the head without surgery in order to determine if there is internal bleeding or swelling in the brain. Computed tomography (CT) has become the diagnostic modality of choice for head trauma due to its accuracy, reliability, safety, and wide availability. The changes in microcirculation, impaired auto-regulation, cerebral edema, and axonal injury start as soon as a head injury occurs and manifest as clinical, biochemical, and radiological changes. An MRI may also be conducted to determine if someone has abnormal growths or tumors in the brain or to determine if the patient has had a stroke.\nGlasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is the most widely used scoring system used to assess the level of severity of a brain injury. This method is based on objective observations of specific traits to determine the severity of a brain injury. It is based on three traits: eye-opening, verbal response, and motor response, which are gauged as described below. \nBased on the Glasgow Coma Scale severity is classified as follows:\nThere are several imaging techniques that can aid in diagnosing and assessing the extent of brain damage, including:\nCT scans and MRI are the two techniques widely used and are the most effective. CT scans can show brain bleeds, fractures of the skull, fluid build up in the brain that will lead to increased cranial pressure. MRI is able to better detect smaller injuries, detect damage within the brain, diffuse axonal injury, injuries to the brainstem, posterior fossa, and subtemporal and sub frontal regions. However, patients with pacemakers, metallic implants, or other metal within their bodies are unable to have an MRI done. Typically the other imaging techniques are not used in a clinical setting because of the cost, lack of availability.\nManagement.\nMost head injuries are of a benign nature and require no treatment beyond analgesics such as acetaminophen. Non-steroidal painkillers such as ibuprofen are avoided since they could make any potential bleeding worse. Due to the high risk of even minor brain injuries, close monitoring for potential complications such as intracranial bleeding. If the brain has been severely damaged by trauma, a neurosurgical evaluation may be useful. Treatments may involve controlling elevated intracranial pressure. This can include sedation, paralytics, cerebrospinal fluid diversion. Second-line alternatives include decompressive craniectomy (Jagannathan et al. found a net 65% favorable outcomes rate in pediatric patients), barbiturate coma, hypertonic saline, and hypothermia. Although all of these methods have potential benefits, there has been no randomized study that has shown unequivocal benefit.\nClinicians will often consult clinical decision support rules such as the Canadian CT Head Rule or the New Orleans/Charity Head injury/Trauma Rule to decide if the patient needs further imaging studies or observation only. Rules like these are usually studied in depth by multiple research groups with large patient cohorts to ensure accuracy given the risk of adverse events in this area.\nThere is a subspecialty certification available for brain injury medicine that signifies expertise in the treatment of brain injury.\nPrognosis.\nPrognosis, or the likely progress of a disorder, depends on the nature, location, and cause of the brain damage (see Traumatic brain injury, Focal and diffuse brain injury, Primary and secondary brain injury).\nIn children with uncomplicated minor head injuries the risk of intracranial bleeding over the next year is rare at 2 cases per 1 million. In some cases transient neurological disturbances may occur, lasting minutes to hours. Malignant post traumatic cerebral swelling can develop unexpectedly in stable patients after an injury, as can post-traumatic seizures. Recovery in children with neurologic deficits will vary. Children with neurologic deficits who improve daily are more likely to recover, while those who are vegetative for months are less likely to improve. Most patients without deficits have full recovery. However, persons who sustain head trauma resulting in unconsciousness for an hour or more have twice the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease later in life.\nHead injury may be associated with a neck injury. Bruises on the back or neck, neck pain, or pain radiating to the arms are signs of cervical spine injury and merit spinal immobilization via application of a cervical collar and possibly a longboard. If the neurological exam is normal this is reassuring. Reassessment is needed if there is a worsening headache, seizure, one-sided weakness, or has persistent vomiting.\nTo combat overuse of head CT scans yielding negative intracranial hemorrhage results, which unnecessarily exposes patients to radiation and increase time in the hospital and cost of the visit, multiple clinical decision support rules have been developed to help clinicians weigh the option to scan a patient with a head injury. Among these are the Canadian Head CT rule, the PECARN Head Injury/Trauma Algorithm, and the New Orleans/Charity Head Injury/Trauma Rule all help clinicians make these decisions using easily obtained information and noninvasive practices.\nBrain injuries are very hard to predict in the outcome. Many tests and specialists are needed to determine the likelihood of the prognosis. People with minor brain damage can have debilitating side effects; not just severe brain damage has debilitating effects. The side-effects of a brain injury depend on location and the body's response to injury. Even a mild concussion can have long term effects that may not resolve.\nHistory.\nThe foundation for understanding human behavior and brain injury can be attributed to the case of Phineas Gage and the famous case studies by Paul Broca. The first case study on Phineas Gage's head injury is one of the most astonishing brain injuries in history. In 1848, Phineas Gage was paving way for a new railroad line when he encountered an accidental explosion of a tamping iron straight through his frontal lobe. Gage observed to be intellectually unaffected but exemplified post-injury behavioral deficits. These deficits include: becoming sporadic, disrespectful, extremely profane, and gave no regard for other workers. Gage started having seizures in February 1860, dying only four months later on May 21, 1860.\nTen years later, Paul Broca examined two patients exhibiting impaired speech due to frontal lobe injuries. Broca's first patient lacked productive speech. He saw this as an opportunity to address language localization. It wasn't until Leborgne, formally known as \"tan\", died when Broca confirmed the frontal lobe lesion from an autopsy. The second patient had similar speech impairments, supporting his findings on language localization. The results of both cases became a vital verification of the relationship between speech and the left cerebral hemisphere. The affected areas are known today as Broca's area and Broca's Aphasia.\nA few years later, a German neuroscientist, Carl Wernicke, consulted on a stroke patient. The patient experienced neither speech nor hearing impairments but had a few brain deficits. These deficits included: lacking the ability to comprehend what was spoken to him and the words written down. After his death, Wernicke examined his autopsy that found a lesion located in the left temporal region. This area became known as Wernicke's area. Wernicke later hypothesized the relationship between Wernicke's area and Broca's area, which was proven fact.\nEpidemiology.\nHead injury is the leading cause of death in many countries.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "37642", "revid": "4013656", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37642", "title": "Tremor", "text": "Involuntary muscle contraction\nMedical condition&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Infobox/styles-images.css\" /&gt;\nA tremor is an involuntary, somewhat rhythmic muscle contraction and relaxation involving oscillations or twitching movements of one or more body parts. It is the most common of all involuntary movements and can affect the hands, arms, eyes, face, head, vocal folds, trunk, and legs. Most tremors occur in the hands. In some people, a tremor is a symptom of another neurological disorder.\nTypes.\nTremor is most commonly classified by clinical features and cause or origin. Some of the better-known forms of tremor, with their symptoms, include the following:\nTremor can result from other conditions as well\nCauses.\nTremor can be a symptom associated with disorders in those parts of the brain that control muscles throughout the body or in particular areas, such as the hands. Neurological disorders or conditions that can produce tremor include multiple sclerosis, stroke, traumatic brain injury, chronic kidney disease and a number of neurodegenerative diseases that damage or destroy parts of the brainstem or the cerebellum, Parkinson's disease being the one most often associated with tremor. Lesions of the Guillain-Mollaret triangle (also called myoclonic triangle or dentato-rubro-olivary pathway) impair the predictions performed by the cerebellum, causing repetitive muscle discharges by triggering oscillatory activity in the central nervous system. Other causes include the use of drugs (such as amphetamines, cocaine, caffeine, corticosteroids, SSRIs) or alcohol, mercury poisoning, or the withdrawal of drugs such as alcohol or benzodiazepine. Tremors can also be seen in infants with phenylketonuria (PKU), overactive thyroid or liver failure. Tremors can be an indication of hypoglycemia, along with palpitations, sweating and anxiety.\nTremor can also be caused by lack of sleep, lack of vitamins, or increased stress. Deficiencies of magnesium and thiamine have also been known to cause tremor or shaking, which resolves when the deficiency is corrected. Tremors in animals can also be caused by some spider bites, e.g. the redback spider of Australia.\nDiagnosis.\nDuring a physical exam, a doctor can determine whether the tremor occurs primarily during action or at rest. The doctor will also check for tremor symmetry, any sensory loss, weakness or muscle atrophy, or decreased reflexes. A detailed family history may indicate if the tremor is inherited. Blood or urine tests can detect thyroid malfunction, other metabolic causes, and abnormal levels of certain chemicals that can cause tremor. These tests may also help to identify contributing causes, such as drug interaction, chronic alcoholism, or another condition or disease. Diagnostic imaging using CT or MRI imaging may help determine if the tremor is the result of a structural defect or degeneration of the brain.\nThe doctor will perform a neurological examination to assess nerve function and motor and sensory skills. The tests are designed to determine any functional limitations, such as difficulty with handwriting or the ability to hold a utensil or cup. The patient may be asked to place a finger on the tip of her or his nose, draw a spiral, or perform other tasks or exercises.\nThe doctor may order an electromyogram to diagnose muscle or nerve problems. This test measures involuntary muscle activity and muscle response to nerve stimulation. The selection of the sensors used is important. In addition to studies of muscle activity, tremor can be assessed with accuracy using accelerometers .\nCategories.\nTremors are assessed according to amplitude, frequency, affected body parts, and the position or activity in which the tremor manifests. The combination of these four factors indicates likely diagnoses. For example, early Parkinson's first tends to manifest as a slow tremor in one hand while resting and disappears during intentional movements, but essential tremor appears symmetrically, during intentional movements and disappears while resting.\nThe degree of tremor should be assessed in four positions. The tremor can then be classified by which position most accentuates the tremor:\nTreatment.\nThere is no cure for most tremors. The appropriate treatment depends on accurate diagnosis of the cause. Some tremors respond to treatment of the underlying condition. For example, in some cases of psychogenic tremor, treating the patient's underlying psychological problem may cause the tremor to disappear. A few medications can help relieve symptoms temporarily.\nMedications.\nMedications remain the basis of therapy in many cases. Symptomatic drug therapy is available for several forms of tremor:\nLifestyle.\nEliminating tremor \"triggers,\" including stimulants such as caffeine, from the diet is often recommended.\nEssential tremor may benefit from slight doses of ethanol, but the potential negative consequences of regular ethanol intake need to be taken into account. Due to the risks, alternatives such as \"GABAergic drugs like sodium oxybate and NASs, LVA Ca2+ channel blockers like zonisamide, glutamate receptor antagonists like perampanel, and long-chain alcohols like 1-octanol\" are preferred. Beta blockers have been used as an alternative to alcohol in sports such as competitive dart playing and carry less potential for addiction.\nPhysical therapy and occupational therapy may help to reduce tremor and improve coordination and muscle control for some patients. A physical therapist or occupational therapist will evaluate the patient for tremor positioning, muscle control, muscle strength, and functional skills. Teaching the patient to brace the affected limb during the tremor or to hold an affected arm close to the body is sometimes useful in gaining motion control. Coordination and balancing exercises may help some patients. Some occupational therapists recommend the use of weights, splints, other adaptive equipment, and special plates and utensils for eating.\nSurgery.\nSurgical intervention such as thalamotomy and deep brain stimulation may ease certain tremors. These surgeries are usually performed only when the tremor is severe and does not respond to drugs, and further evidence is required to determine the best course of treatment for any individual patient. Response to surgeries can be excellent, reducing some symptoms such as \"tremors, stiffness, slowness, and dyskinesias\" for patients with Parkinson's Disease. \nThalamotomy, involving the creation of lesions in the brain region called the thalamus, is quite effective in treating patients with essential, cerebellar, or Parkinsonian tremor. This in-hospital procedure is performed under local anesthesia, with the patient awake. After the patient's head is secured in a metal frame, the surgeon maps the patient's brain to locate the thalamus. A small hole is drilled through the skull and a temperature-controlled electrode is inserted into the thalamus. A low-frequency current is passed through the electrode to activate the tremor and to confirm proper placement. Once the site has been confirmed, the electrode is heated to create a temporary lesion. Testing is done to examine speech, language, coordination, and tremor activation, if any. If no problems occur, the probe is again heated to create a 3-mm permanent lesion. The probe, when cooled to body temperature, is withdrawn and the skull hole is covered. The lesion causes the tremor to permanently disappear without disrupting sensory or motor control.\nDeep brain stimulation (DBS) uses implantable electrodes to send high-frequency electrical signals to the thalamus. The electrodes are implanted as described above. The patient uses a hand-held magnet to turn on and turn off a pulse generator that is surgically implanted under the skin. The electrical stimulation temporarily disables the tremor and can be \"reversed\", if necessary, by turning off the implanted electrode. Batteries in the generator last about 5 years and can be replaced surgically. DBS is currently used to treat parkinsonian tremor and essential tremor. It is also applied successfully for other rare causes of tremor.\nThe most common side effects of tremor surgery include dysarthria (problems with motor control of speech), temporary or permanent cognitive impairment (including visual and learning difficulties), and problems with balance.\nBiomechanical loading.\nAs well as medication, rehabilitation programmes and surgical interventions, the application of biomechanical loading on tremor movement has been shown to be a technique that is able to suppress the effects of tremor on the human body. It has been established in the literature that most of the different types of tremor respond to biomechanical loading. In particular, it has been clinically tested that the increase of damping or inertia in the upper limb leads to a reduction of the tremorous motion. Biomechanical loading relies on an external device that either passively or actively acts mechanically in parallel to the upper limb to counteract tremor movement. This phenomenon gives rise to the possibility of an orthotic management of tremor.\nStarting from this principle, the development of upper-limb non-invasive ambulatory robotic exoskeletons is presented as a promising solution for patients who cannot benefit from medication to suppress the tremor. In this area robotic exoskeletons have emerged, in the form of orthoses, to provide motor assistance and functional compensation to disabled people. An orthosis is a wearable device that acts in parallel to the affected limb. In the case of tremor management, the orthosis must apply a damping or inertial load to a selected set of limb articulations.\nRecently, some studies demonstrated that exoskeletons could achieve a consistent 40% of tremor power reduction for all users, being able to attain a reduction ratio in the order of 80% tremor power in specific joints of users with severe tremor. In addition, the users reported that the exoskeleton did not affect their voluntary motion. These results indicate the feasibility of tremor suppression through biomechanical loading.\nThe main drawbacks of this mechanical management of tremor are (1) the resulting bulky solutions, (2) the inefficiency in transmitting loads from the exoskeleton to the human musculo-skeletal system and (3) technological limitations in terms of actuator technologies. In this regard, current trends in this field are focused on the evaluation of the concept of biomechanical loading of tremor through selective Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) based on a (Brain-to-Computer Interaction) BCI-driven detection of involuntary (tremor) motor activity.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "37649", "revid": "125972", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37649", "title": "Amplitude", "text": "Measure of change in a periodic variable\nThe amplitude of a periodic variable is a measure of its change in a single period (such as time or spatial period). The amplitude of a non-periodic signal is its magnitude compared with a reference value. There are various definitions of amplitude (see below), which are all functions of the magnitude of the differences between the variable's extreme values. In older texts, the phase of a periodic function is sometimes called the amplitude.\nDefinitions.\nPeak amplitude.\nIn audio system measurements, telecommunications and others where the measurand is a signal that swings above and below a reference value but is not sinusoidal, peak amplitude is often used. If the reference is zero, this is the maximum absolute value of the signal; if the reference is a mean value (DC component), the peak amplitude is the maximum absolute value of the difference from that reference.\nPeak-to-peak amplitude.\nPeak-to-peak amplitude (abbreviated p\u2013p or PtP or PtoP) is the change between peak (highest amplitude value) and trough (lowest amplitude value, which can be negative). With appropriate circuitry, peak-to-peak amplitudes of electric oscillations can be measured by meters or by viewing the waveform on an oscilloscope. Peak-to-peak is a straightforward measurement on an oscilloscope, the peaks of the waveform being easily identified and measured against the graticule. This remains a common way of specifying amplitude, but sometimes other measures of amplitude are more appropriate.\nSemi-amplitude.\nSemi-amplitude means half of the peak-to-peak amplitude. \nThe majority of scientific literature employs the term \"amplitude\" or \"peak amplitude\" to mean semi-amplitude.\nIt is the most widely used measure of orbital wobble in astronomy and the measurement of small radial velocity semi-amplitudes of nearby stars is important in the search for exoplanets (see Doppler spectroscopy).\nRoot mean square amplitude.\nRoot mean square (RMS) amplitude is used especially in electrical engineering: the RMS is defined as the square root of the mean over time of the square of the vertical distance of the graph from the rest state;\ni.e. the RMS of the AC waveform (with no DC component).\nFor complicated waveforms, especially non-repeating signals like noise, the RMS amplitude is usually used because it is both unambiguous and has physical significance. For example, the \"average\" power transmitted by an acoustic or electromagnetic wave or by an electrical signal is proportional to the square of the RMS amplitude (and not, in general, to the square of the peak amplitude).\nFor alternating current electric power, the universal practice is to specify RMS values of a sinusoidal waveform. One property of root mean square voltages and currents is that they produce the same heating effect as a direct current in a given resistance.\nThe peak-to-peak value is used, for example, when choosing rectifiers for power supplies, or when estimating the maximum voltage that insulation must withstand. Some common voltmeters are calibrated for RMS amplitude, but respond to the average value of a rectified waveform. Many digital voltmeters and all moving coil meters are in this category. The RMS calibration is only correct for a sine wave input since the ratio between peak, average and RMS values is dependent on waveform. If the wave shape being measured is greatly different from a sine wave, the relationship between RMS and average value changes. True RMS-responding meters were used in radio frequency measurements, where instruments measured the heating effect in a resistor to measure a current. The advent of microprocessor-controlled meters capable of calculating RMS by sampling the waveform has made true RMS measurement commonplace.\nPulse amplitude.\nIn telecommunications, \"pulse amplitude\" is the magnitude of a pulse parameter, such as the voltage level, current level, field intensity, or power level.\nPulse amplitude is measured with respect to a specified reference and therefore should be modified by qualifiers, such as \"average\", \"instantaneous\", \"peak\", or \"root-mean-square\".\nPulse amplitude also applies to the amplitude of frequency- and phase-modulated waveform envelopes.\nAmbiguity.\nFor symmetric periodic waves, like sine waves, square waves, or triangle waves, \"peak amplitude\" and \"semi amplitude\" are the same.\nHowever, for an asymmetric wave or wave packet (periodic pulses in one direction, for example), the peak amplitude becomes ambiguous. This is because the value is different depending on whether the maximum positive signal is measured relative to the mean, the maximum negative signal is measured relative to the mean, or the maximum positive signal is measured relative to the maximum negative signal (the \"peak-to-peak amplitude\") and then divided by two (the \"semi-amplitude\"). In electrical engineering, the usual solution to this ambiguity is to measure the amplitude from a defined reference potential (such as ground or 0\u00a0V). Strictly speaking, this is no longer amplitude since there is the possibility that a constant (DC component) is included in the measurement.\nFormal representation.\nIn this simple wave equation\nformula_1\nUnits.\nThe units of the amplitude depend on the type of wave, but are always in the same units as the oscillating variable. A more general representation of the wave equation is more complex, but the role of amplitude remains analogous to this simple case.\nFor waves on a string, or in a medium such as water, the amplitude is a displacement.\nThe amplitude of sound waves and audio signals (which relates to the volume) conventionally refers to the amplitude of the air pressure in the wave, but sometimes the amplitude of the displacement (movements of the air or the diaphragm of a speaker) is described. The logarithm of the amplitude squared is usually quoted in dB, so a null amplitude corresponds to \u2212\u221e\u00a0dB. Loudness is related to amplitude and intensity and is one of the most salient qualities of a sound, although in general sounds it can be recognized independently of amplitude. The square of the amplitude is proportional to the intensity of the wave.\nFor electromagnetic radiation, the amplitude of a photon corresponds to the changes in the electric field of the wave. However, radio signals may be carried by electromagnetic radiation; the intensity of the radiation (amplitude modulation) or the frequency of the radiation (frequency modulation) is oscillated and then the individual oscillations are varied (modulated) to produce the signal.\nAmplitude envelopes.\nAmplitude envelope refers to the changes in the amplitude of a sound over time, and is an influential property as it affects perception of timbre. A flat tone has a steady state amplitude that remains constant during time, which is represented by a scalar. Other sounds can have percussive amplitude envelopes featuring an abrupt onset followed by an immediate exponential decay.\nPercussive amplitude envelopes are characteristic of various impact sounds: two wine glasses clinking together, hitting a drum, slamming a door, etc. where the amplitude is transient and must be represented as either a continuous function or a discrete vector. Percussive amplitude envelopes model many common sounds that have a transient loudness attack, decay, sustain, and release.\nAmplitude normalization.\nWith waveforms containing many overtones, complex transient timbres can be achieved by assigning each overtone to its own distinct transient amplitude envelope. Unfortunately, this has the effect of modulating the loudness of the sound as well. It makes more sense to separate loudness and harmonic quality to be parameters controlled independently of each other.\nTo do so, harmonic amplitude envelopes are frame-by-frame normalized to become amplitude \"proportion\" envelopes, where at each time frame all the harmonic amplitudes will add to 100% (or 1). This way, the main loudness-controlling envelope can be cleanly controlled.\nIn Sound Recognition, max amplitude normalization can be used to help align the key harmonic features of 2 alike sounds, allowing similar timbres to be recognized independent of loudness.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "37652", "revid": "1893265", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37652", "title": "Kyoto", "text": "City in the Kansai region of Japan\nKyoto ( or ; Japanese: , \"Ky\u014dto\" ), officially , is the capital city of Kyoto Prefecture in the Kansai region of Japan's largest and most populous island of Honshu. As of 2020[ [update]], the city had a population of 1.46 million, making it the ninth-most populous city in Japan. More than half (56.8%) of Kyoto Prefecture's population resides in the city. The city is the cultural anchor of the substantially larger Greater Kyoto, a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) home to a census-estimated 3.8 million people. It is also part of the even larger Keihanshin metropolitan area, along with Osaka and Kobe.\nKyoto is one of the oldest municipalities in Japan, having been chosen in 794 as the new seat of Japan's imperial court by Emperor Kanmu. The original city, named Heian-ky\u014d, was arranged in accordance with traditional Chinese feng shui following the model of the ancient Chinese capitals of Chang'an and Luoyang. The emperors of Japan ruled from Kyoto in the following eleven centuries until 1869. It was the scene of several key events of the Muromachi period, Sengoku period, and the Boshin War, such as the \u014cnin War, the Honn\u014d-ji Incident, the Kinmon incident, and the Battle of Toba\u2013Fushimi. The capital was relocated from Kyoto to Tokyo after the Meiji Restoration. The modern municipality of Kyoto was established in 1889. The city was spared from large-scale destruction during World War II and, as a result, its prewar cultural heritage has mostly been preserved.\nKyoto is considered the cultural capital of Japan and is a major tourist destination. The Agency for Cultural Affairs of the national government is headquartered in the city. It is home to numerous Buddhist temples, Shinto shrines, palaces and gardens, some of which have been designated collectively as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Prominent landmarks include the Kyoto Imperial Palace, Kiyomizu-dera, Kinkaku-ji, Ginkaku-ji, and Kyoto Tower. The internationally renowned video game company Nintendo is based in Kyoto. Kyoto is also a center of higher learning in the country, and its institutions include Kyoto University, the second-oldest university in Japan.\nName.\nIn Japanese, Kyoto was previously called Ky\u014d (), Miyako (), Ky\u014d no Miyako (), and . After becoming the capital of Japan at the start of the Heian period (794\u20131185), the city was often referred to as Heian-ky\u014d (, \"Heian capital\"), and late in the Heian period the city came to be widely referred to simply as \"Ky\u014dto\" (, \"capital city\"). After the seat of the emperor was moved to the city of Edo and that city was renamed \"T\u014dky\u014d\" (, meaning \"eastern capital\"), Kyoto was briefly known as \"Saiky\u014d\" (, meaning \"western capital\"). As the capital of Japan from 794 to 1868, Kyoto is sometimes called the thousand-year capital ().\nHistorically, foreign spellings for the city's name have included Kioto and Miaco or Meaco.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nAmple archeological evidence suggests human settlement in the area of Kyoto began as early as the Paleolithic period, although not much published material is retained about human activity in the region before the 6th century, around which time the Shimogamo Shrine is believed to have been established. Before Kyoto became the imperial capital, immigrants from mainland Asia contributed to the development of the area.\nDuring the 8th century, when powerful Buddhist clergy became involved in the affairs of the imperial government, Emperor Kanmu chose to relocate the capital in order to distance it from the clerical establishment in Nara. His last choice for the site was the village of Uda, in the Kadono district of Yamashiro Province.\nThe new city, , modeled after Chinese Tang dynasty capital Chang'an, became the seat of Japan's imperial court in 794, beginning the Heian period of Japanese history. Although military rulers established their governments either in Kyoto (Muromachi shogunate) or in other cities such as Kamakura (Kamakura shogunate) and Edo (Tokugawa shogunate), Kyoto remained Japan's capital until the transfer of the imperial court to Tokyo in 1869 at the time of the Imperial Restoration.\nFeudal period.\nIn the Sengoku period, the city suffered extensive destruction in the \u014cnin War of 1467\u20131477, and did not really recover until the mid-16th century. During the war, battles between samurai factions spilled into the streets, and came to involve court nobility (\"kuge\") and religious factions as well. Nobles' mansions were transformed into fortresses, deep trenches dug throughout the city for defense and as firebreaks, and numerous buildings burned. The city has not seen such widespread destruction since.\nIn the late 16th century, Toyotomi Hideyoshi reconstructed the city by building new streets to double the number of north\u2013south streets in central Kyoto, creating rectangle blocks superseding ancient square blocks. Toyotomi also built earthwork walls called encircling the city. Teramachi Street in central Kyoto is a Buddhist temple quarter where Toyotomi gathered temples in the city.\nEarly modern period.\nIn 1603, the Tokugawa Shogunate was established at Edo (present-day Tokyo), marking the beginning of the Edo period. Nevertheless, Kyoto flourished as one of three major cities in Japan, the others being Osaka and Edo. At the end of the period, the Hamaguri rebellion of 1864 burned down 28,000 houses in the city, which showed the rebels' dissatisfaction towards the Tokugawa Shogunate.\nModern period.\nAt the start of the Meiji period, the emperor's move from Kyoto to Tokyo in 1869 threatened Kyoto's economic and administrative standing, prompting the city government and local interests to undertake a coordinated plan to strengthen its industrial base and modernize.\nAdoption of western architectural style.\nPublic buildings from the late Meiji era incorporated European and American design elements as symbols of modernity:\nThe modern city of Kyoto was officially formed on April 1, 1889, and by 1932, the population of the city exceeded one million.\nContemporary history.\nThere was some consideration by the United States of targeting Kyoto with an atomic bomb at the end of World War II because of the possibility that the city's importance was great enough that its loss might persuade Japan to surrender. In the end, at the insistence of Henry L. Stimson, Secretary of War in the Roosevelt and Truman administrations, the city was removed from the list of targets and replaced by Nagasaki. The city was largely spared from conventional bombing as well, although small-scale air raids did result in casualties. During the occupation, the U.S. Sixth Army and I Corps were headquartered in Kyoto.\nAs a result, Kyoto is one of the few Japanese cities that still have an abundance of prewar buildings, such as the traditional townhouses known as \"machiya\". However, modernization is continually breaking down traditional Kyoto in favor of newer architecture, such as the Ky\u014dto Station complex.\nKyoto became a city designated by government ordinance on September 1, 1956. In 1994, 17 historic monuments in Kyoto were inscribed on the list as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. In 1997, Kyoto hosted the conference that resulted in the protocol on greenhouse gas emissions (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change).\nGeography.\nTerrain.\nKyoto is located in a valley, part of the Yamashiro (or Kyoto) Basin, in the eastern part of the mountainous region known as the Tamba highlands. The Yamashiro Basin is surrounded on three sides by mountains known as Higashiyama, Kitayama and Nishiyama (literally \"east mountain\", \"north mountain\" and \"west mountain\" respectively), with a maximum height of approximately above sea level. This interior positioning results in hot summers and cold winters. There are three rivers in the basin, the Uji River to the south, the Katsura River to the west, and the Kamo River to the east. Kyoto City takes up 17.9% of the land in Kyoto Prefecture and has a total area of .\nKyoto sits atop a large natural water table that provides the city with ample freshwater wells. Due to large-scale urbanization, the amount of rain draining into the table is dwindling and wells across the area are drying at an increasing rate.\nClimate.\nKyoto has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Cfa\"), featuring a marked seasonal variation in temperature and precipitation. Summers are hot and humid, but winters are relatively cold with occasional snowfall. Kyoto's rainy season begins around the middle of June and lasts until the end of July, yielding to a hot and sunny latter half of the summer. Kyoto, like most of the Pacific coast and central areas of Japan, is prone to typhoons during the summer and autumn.\nAdministrative divisions.\nIn the 1870s, the city was divided into a northern ward (Kamigy\u014d-ku) and a southern ward (Shimogy\u014d-ku), each working as individual administrative divisions of Kyoto Prefecture. The modern municipality was created by the unification of these wards into the city of Kyoto in 1889.\nDue to the creation of new administrative districts and a number of municipal mergers that took place between the 1920s and the 1970s, the contemporary city of Kyoto is divided into eleven . The central wards, located to the west of the Kamo River, are small and densely populated. The city hall is located in Nakagy\u014d-ku, and the Kyoto prefectural offices are located in present-day Kamigy\u014d-ku.\nCityscape.\nKyoto contains roughly 2,000 temples and shrines. The main business district is located to the south of the Kyoto Imperial Palace. In the center of the city, there are several covered shopping arcades only open to pedestrian traffic, such as Teramachi Street and Shinky\u014dgoku Street.\nThe original city was arranged in accordance with traditional Chinese feng shui following the model of the ancient Chinese capital of Chang'an/Luoyang. The Imperial Palace faced south, resulting in Uky\u014d (the right sector of the capital) being on the west, while Saky\u014d (the left sector) is on the east. The streets in the modern-day wards of Kamigy\u014d-ku, Nakagy\u014d-ku, and Shimogy\u014d-ku still follow a grid pattern. Areas outside of the city center do not follow the same grid pattern, though streets throughout Kyoto are referred to by name, a practice that is rare in most regions of Japan.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nKyoto was the largest city in Japan until the late 16th century, when its population was surpassed by those of Osaka and Edo. Before World War II, Kyoto vied with Kobe and Nagoya to rank as the fourth- or fifth-largest city in Japan. Having avoided most wartime destruction, it was again the third-largest city in 1947. By 1960 it had fallen to fifth again, and by 1990 it had fallen to seventh. As of January 2022[ [update]], it was the ninth-largest city in Japan by population and had led the country in population decrease for two consecutive years. However, the population of the city rises during standard working hours, and Kyoto ranks seventh in Japan in terms of daytime population.\nApproximately 55% of the total population of Kyoto Prefecture is concentrated in the city of Kyoto, which is the highest ratio among the prefectures of Japan.\nGovernment.\nThe city of Kyoto is governed by the mayor of Kyoto and the Kyoto City Assembly, a municipal council.\nKyoto City Assembly.\nThe legislative city assembly has 67 elected members, and terms are four years in length. As of 2024, the assembly is controlled by a coalition of members affiliated with the Liberal Democratic Party, Komeito, and the Democratic Civic Forum.\nList of mayors.\nBetween the founding of the modern city and 1898, the governor of Kyoto Prefecture also acted as the mayor of the city of Kyoto. From 1898 through the Second World War, mayors were nominated by the Kyoto City Assembly and appointed by the Minister of Home Affairs.\nSince 1947, mayors of Kyoto have been chosen by direct election to four-year terms. As of 2024, there have been ten mayors elected using this system. While some mayors have resigned or died in office, no mayor has lost a reelection bid in the postwar period. In the 2024 Kyoto mayoral election, independent candidate Koji Matsui was elected for the first time, supported by the Liberal Democratic Party, Komeito, the Constitutional Democratic Party, and the Democratic Party for the People.\nEconomy.\nInformation technology and electronics are key industries in Kyoto. The city is home to the headquarters of Nintendo, Intelligent Systems, SCREEN Holdings, Tose, Hatena, Omron, Kyocera, Shimadzu, Rohm Semiconductor, Horiba, Nidec Corporation, Nichicon, Nissin Electric, and GS Yuasa.\nDomestic and international tourism contributes significantly to Kyoto's economy. In 2014, the city government announced that a record number of tourists had visited Kyoto. As a result of a sharp decline in tourism during the COVID-19 pandemic, the mayor acknowledged in 2021 \"the possibility of bankruptcy in the next decade\" and announced job cuts in the administration and cuts in social assistance, including reductions in funding for home care.\nTraditional Japanese crafts are also a major industry of Kyoto; Kyoto's kimono weavers are particularly renowned, and the city remains the premier center of kimono manufacturing. Sake brewing is another prominent traditional industry in Kyoto, and the headquarters of major sake brewers Gekkeikan and Takara Holdings are found in Kyoto.\nOther notable businesses headquartered in Kyoto include Aiful, Ishida, Nissen Holdings, Gyoza no Ohsho, Sagawa Express, Volks, and Wacoal.\nEducation.\nPrimary and secondary education.\nAs of 1 May 2023, there were 154 municipal public elementary schools in Kyoto, with a total of 55,736 pupils. At the secondary level, there were 66 municipal public junior high schools with 27,046 students and 11 municipal public senior high schools with 5,117 students. Beyond the public system, the city hosts several private institutions to cater to different international curricula:\nTertiary education.\nHome to 40 institutions of higher education, Kyoto is one of the academic centers in Japan. Kyoto University is ranked highly among all universities nationwide, with eight Nobel laureates and two Prime Ministers of Japan among its alumni. The Research Institute for Mathematical Sciences and the Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics, both part of the university, have been affiliated with influential mathematicians and physicists. Private universities such as Doshisha University and Ritsumeikan University are also located in the city.\nThe Consortium of Universities in Kyoto is a Kyoto-based higher education network consisting of three national universities, three public (prefectural and municipal) universities, 45 private universities, five other organizations, and representatives from the city government. The Consortium does not offer degrees, but allows students of member universities to take courses at other member universities.\nIn addition to Japanese universities and colleges, educational institutions from other countries operate programs in the city. The Kyoto Consortium for Japanese Studies (KCJS) is a group of 14 American universities that runs overseas academic programs in Japanese language and cultural studies for university students. Similarly, the Associated Kyoto Program runs a study-abroad academic program with a focus on cultural, language, and historical learning in and around the Kansai metropolitan area.\nTransportation.\nRailways.\nKyoto is served by rail transportation systems operated by several different companies and organizations. The city's main gateway terminal, Ky\u014dto Station, connects the T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen bullet train line with five JR West lines, a Kintetsu line, and a municipal subway line.\nThe Keihan Electric Railway, the Hankyu Railway, and other rail networks also offer frequent services within the city and to other cities and suburbs in the Kinki region. Although Kyoto does not have its own commercial airport, the limited express \"Haruka\" operated by JR West carries passengers from Kansai International Airport to Ky\u014dto Station in 73 minutes.\nThe Kyoto Railway Museum in Shimogy\u014d-ku, operated by JR West, displays many steam, diesel, and electric locomotives used in Japan from the 1880s to the present.\nHigh-speed rail.\nThe Tokaid\u014d Shinkansen, operated by JR Central, provides high-speed rail service linking Kyoto with Nagoya, Yokohama, and Tokyo to the east and with nearby Osaka to the west. Beyond Osaka, many trains boarding at Kyoto continue on the San'y\u014d Shinkansen route managed by JR West, providing access to cities including Kobe, Okayama, Hiroshima, Kitakyushu, and Fukuoka. The trip from Tokyo to Kyoto takes around 2.5 hours, and the trip from Hakata Station in Fukuoka to Kyoto takes just over three hours by the fastest train service \"Nozomi\". All Shinkansen trains stop at Ky\u014dto Station, including \"Hikari\" and \"Kodama\" trains.\n*Hankyu Arashiyama Line\n*Hankyu Kyoto Main Line\n*Keihan Main Line\n**Keihan \u014ct\u014d Line\n*Keihan Keishin Line\n*Keihan Uji Line\n*Kintetsu Kyoto Line\n*Sagano Scenic Line\n*Kosei Line\n*Nara Line\n*San'in Main Line (Sagano Line)\n*T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line (JR Kyoto Line/Biwako Line)\nSubways.\nThe Kyoto Municipal Transportation Bureau operates the Kyoto Municipal Subway consisting of two lines: the Karasuma Line and the T\u014dzai Line. The two lines are linked at Karasuma Oike Station near Kyoto's central business district.\nThe Karasuma Line runs primarily north to south between the terminal of Kokusaikaikan Station and Takeda Station, and takes its name from the fact that trains run beneath Karasuma Street between Kita\u014dji Station in Kita-ku and J\u016bj\u014d Station in Minami-ku. The Karasuma Line connects to the Hankyu Kyoto Main Line at the intersection of Shij\u014d Karasuma in Kyoto's central business district and to JR lines and the Kyoto Kintetsu Line at Ky\u014dto Station. In addition, the Transportation Bureau and Kintetsu jointly operate through services which continue to Kintetsu Nara Station in Nara, the capital city of Nara Prefecture.\nThe T\u014dzai Line runs from the southeastern area of the city towards the center, then east to west (\"t\u014dzai\" in Japanese) through the Kyoto downtown area where trains run beneath the east\u2013west streets of Sanj\u014d Street, Oike Street, and Oshik\u014dji Street. The Keihan Keishin Line has been integrated into this line, and thus Keihan provides through services to Hama\u014dtsu in the neighboring city of \u014ctsu, the capital of Shiga Prefecture. Within the city of Kyoto, the T\u014dzai Line also connects to the Keihan lines at Yamashina Station, Misasagi Station, and Sanj\u014d Keihan Station, and to the Keifuku Electric Railroad at the terminal of Uzumasa Tenjingawa Station.\n*Eizan Kurama Line\n*Eizan Main Line\n*Keifuku Arashiyama Main Line\n*Keifuku Kitano Line\nBuses.\nKyoto's municipal bus network is extensive. Private carriers also operate within the city. Many tourists join commuters on the public buses, or take tour buses. Kyoto's buses have announcements in English and electronic signs with stops written in the Latin alphabet. Buses operating on routes within the city, the region, and the nation stop at Ky\u014dto Station. In addition to Ky\u014dto Station, bus transfer is available at the intersection of Shij\u014d Kawaramachi, Sanj\u014d Keihan Station, and the intersection of Karasuma Kita\u014dji near Kita\u014dji Station.\nRoads and waterways.\nBecause many older streets in Kyoto are narrow, there are a significant number of one-way roads without sidewalks. Cycling is a common form of personal transportation in the city, although there are few areas set aside for bicycle parking and bicycles parked in restricted areas are impounded.\nKyoto has fewer toll-highways than other Japanese cities of comparable size. There are nine national highways in the city of Kyoto: Route 1, Route 8, Route 9, Route 24, Route 162, Route 171, Route 367, Route 477, and Route 478.\nThe city is connected with other parts of Japan by the Meishin Expressway, which has two interchanges in the city: Kyoto-higashi Interchange (Kyoto East) in Yamashina-ku and Kyoto-minami Interchange (Kyoto South) in Fushimi-ku. The Kyoto J\u016bkan Expressway connects the city to the northern regions of Kyoto Prefecture. The Second Keihan Highway is another bypass to Osaka.\nTraditionally, trade and haulage took place by waterway, and there continue to be a number of navigable rivers and canals in Kyoto. In contemporary Kyoto, however, waterways are no longer commonly used for transportation of passengers or goods, other than for limited sightseeing purposes such as excursion boats on the Hozu River and cormorant fishing boats on the \u014ci River.\nCulture.\nAlthough ravaged by wars, fires, and earthquakes during its eleven centuries as the imperial capital, Kyoto suffered only minor damage in World War II. Kyoto remains Japan's cultural center. About 20% of Japan's National Treasures and 14% of Important Cultural Properties exist in the city proper. The government of Japan relocated the Agency for Cultural Affairs to Kyoto in 2023.\nWith its 2,000 religious places \u2013 1,600 Buddhist temples and 400 Shinto shrines, as well as palaces, gardens and architecture \u2013 intact, it is one of the best preserved cities in Japan. Among the most famous temples in Japan are Kiyomizu-dera, a magnificent wooden temple supported by pillars off the slope of a mountain; Kinkaku-ji, the Temple of the Golden Pavilion; Ginkaku-ji, the Temple of the Silver Pavilion; and Ry\u014dan-ji, famous for its rock garden. The Heian Jing\u016b is a Shinto shrine, built in 1895, celebrating the imperial family and commemorating the first and last emperors to reside in Kyoto. Three special sites have connections to the imperial family: the Kyoto Gyoen area including the Kyoto Imperial Palace and Sent\u014d Imperial Palace, homes of the emperors of Japan for many centuries; Katsura Imperial Villa, one of the nation's finest architectural treasures; and Shugakuin Imperial Villa, one of its best Japanese gardens. In addition, the temple of Sennyu-ji houses the tombs of the emperors from Shij\u014d to K\u014dmei.\nOther sites in Kyoto include Arashiyama, the Gion and Ponto-ch\u014d geisha quarters, the Philosopher's Walk, and the canals that line some of the older streets.\nThe \"Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto\" are listed by the UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. These include the Kamo Shrines (Kami and Shimo), Ky\u014d-\u014d-Gokokuji (T\u014d-ji), Kiyomizu-dera, Daigo-ji, Ninna-ji, Saih\u014d-ji (Kokedera), Tenry\u016b-ji, Rokuon-ji (Kinkaku-ji), Jish\u014d-ji (Ginkaku-ji), Ry\u014dan-ji, Hongan-ji, K\u014dzan-ji, and the Nij\u014d Castle, primarily built by the Tokugawa sh\u014dguns. Other sites outside the city are also on the list.\nKyoto is renowned for its abundance of delicious Japanese foods and cuisine. The special circumstances of Kyoto as a city away from the sea and home to many Buddhist temples resulted in the development of a variety of vegetables peculiar to the . The oldest restaurant in Kyoto is Honke Owariya which was founded in 1465.\nJapan's television and film industry has its center in Kyoto. Many \"jidaigeki\", action films featuring samurai, were shot at Toei Uzumasa Eigamura. A film set and theme park in one, Eigamura features replicas of traditional Japanese buildings, which are used for \"jidaigeki\". Among the sets are a replica of the old Nihonbashi (the bridge at the entry to Edo), a traditional courthouse, a Meiji Period police box and part of the former Yoshiwara red-light district. Actual film shooting takes place occasionally, and visitors are welcome to observe the action.\nThe dialect spoken in Kyoto is known as \"Ky\u014d-kotoba\" or \"Ky\u014dto-ben\", a constituent dialect of the Kansai dialect. Until the late Edo period, the Kyoto dialect was the \"de facto\" standard Japanese, although it has since been replaced by modern standard Japanese. Traditional Kyoto expressions include the polite copula \"dosu\", the honorific verb ending \"-haru\", and the greeting phrase \"okoshi-yasu\".\nFestivals.\nKyoto is well known for its traditional festivals which have been held for over 1,000 years and are a major tourist attraction. The first is the Aoi Matsuri on May 15. The Gion Matsuri known as one of the 3 great festivals of Japan, culminating in a massive parade on July 17. Kyoto marks the Bon Festival with the Gozan no Okuribi, lighting fires on mountains to guide the spirits home on August 16. The October 22 Jidai Matsuri, Festival of the Ages, celebrates Kyoto's illustrious past.\nUNESCO World Heritage Site.\nThe UNESCO World Heritage Site Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto (Kyoto, Uji and Otsu Cities) includes fourteen temples, shrines, and castles in Kyoto dating from between the sixth century (Shimogamo Shrine, though extant structures are more recent) and the seventeenth century (Nij\u014d Castle). The sites were designated as World Heritage in 1994.\nMuseums.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSports.\nKyoto has been the site of many annual sporting events, ranging from the 400-year-old T\u014dshiya archery exhibition held at the Sanj\u016bsangen-d\u014d Temple to the Kyoto Marathon and the Shimadzu All Japan Indoor Tennis Championships.\nSeveral sports teams are based in Kyoto, including professional football and basketball teams. In football, Kyoto has been represented by Kyoto Sanga FC, a club which won the Emperor's Cup in 2002 and rose to J. League's Division 1 in 2005. Kyoto Sanga began as an amateur non-company club in the 1920s, making it the J. League team with the longest history, although it was only after professionalization in the 1990s that it was able to compete in the Japanese top division. Until 2019, Kyoto Sanga used Takebishi Stadium Kyoto in Uky\u014d-ku as its home stadium, but home matches were moved to the city of Kameoka, Kyoto in 2020. There are also several amateur football clubs based in Kyoto. The amateur clubs AS Laranja Kyoto, Ococias Kyoto AC, and Kyoto Shiko Soccer Club compete in the regional Kansai Soccer League.\nAnother professional team based in Kyoto is the Kyoto Hannaryz, a men's basketball team in the First Division of the B.League that plays its home games at the Kyoto City Gymnasium in Uky\u014d-ku. Kyoto has also been the home of other professional teams that have subsequently moved or been disbanded. Between 1949 and 1952, the Central League professional baseball team Shochiku Robins played home games at Kinugasa Ballpark in Kita-ku and Nishi-Ky\u014dgoku Baseball Park (now known as Wakasa Stadium) in Uky\u014d-ku. This team eventually became the Yokohama DeNA BayStars.

{"id": "37653", "revid": "29565593", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37653", "title": "CBS", "text": "American broadcast television and radio network\nCBS Broadcasting Inc., commonly shortened to CBS (an abbreviation of its original name, the Columbia Broadcasting System), is an American commercial broadcast television and radio network and the flagship property of the CBS Entertainment Group division of Paramount Skydance following the 2025 merger of Paramount Global, National Amusements and Skydance Media. It is one of Paramount Skydance's three flagship subsidiaries, along with partial namesake Paramount Pictures and MTV. \nFounded in 1927, headquartered at the CBS Building in New York City and being part of the \"Big Three\" television networks, CBS has major production facilities and operations at the CBS Broadcast Center and One Astor Plaza (both also in that city) and Television City and the CBS Studio Center in Los Angeles. It is sometimes referred to as the Eye Network, after the company's trademark symbol of an eye (which has been in use since October 20, 1951), and also the Tiffany Network, which alludes to the perceived high quality of its programming during the tenure of William S. Paley (and can also refer to some of CBS's first demonstrations of color television, which were held in the former Tiffany and Company Building in New York City in 1950).\nHistory.\nThe network has its origins in United Independent Broadcasters, Inc., a radio network founded in Chicago by New York City talent agent Arthur Judson on January 27, 1927. In April of that year, the Columbia Phonograph Company, parent of Columbia Records' record label, invested in the network, resulting in its rebranding as the Columbia Phonographic Broadcasting System (CPBS). In early 1928, Judson and Columbia sold the network to Isaac and Leon Levy, two brothers who owned WCAU, the network's Philadelphia affiliate, as well as their partner Jerome Louchheim. They installed William S. Paley, an in-law of the Levys, as president of the network. With the Columbia record label out of ownership, Paley rebranded the network as the Columbia Broadcasting System.\nBy September 1928, Paley became the network's majority owner with 51 percent of the business. Paramount Pictures then acquired the other 49 percent of CBS in 1929, but the Great Depression eventually forced the studio to sell its shares back to the network in 1932. CBS would then remain primarily an independent company throughout the next 63 years. Under Paley's guidance, CBS would first become one of the largest radio networks in the United States and eventually one of the Big Three American broadcast television networks. CBS ventured and expanded its horizons through television starting in the 1940s, spinning off its broadcast syndication division Viacom to a separate company in 1971. In 1974, CBS dropped its original full name and became known simply as CBS, Inc.\nThe company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol \"CBS\". The Westinghouse Electric Corporation acquired the network in 1994, renaming its legal name to the current CBS Broadcasting Inc. two years later, and in 1997 adopted the name of the company it had acquired to become CBS Corporation. In 1999, CBS came under the control of the original incarnation of Viacom, which was formed as a spin-off of CBS in 1971. In 2005, Viacom split itself into two separate companies and re-established CBS Corporation through the spin-off of its broadcast television, radio and select cable television and non-broadcasting assets, with the CBS network at its core. CBS Corporation was controlled by Sumner Redstone through National Amusements, which also controlled the second incarnation of Viacom until December 4, 2019, when the two separated companies agreed to re-merge to become ViacomCBS (now known as Paramount Global). Following the sale, CBS and its other broadcasting and entertainment assets were reorganized into a new division, CBS Entertainment Group.\nCBS operated the CBS Radio network until 2017 when it sold its radio division to Entercom (now known as Audacy, Inc. since 2021). Before this, CBS Radio mainly provided news and feature content for its portfolio of owned-and-operated radio stations in large and mid-sized markets, as well as its affiliated radio stations in various other markets. While CBS Corporation common shareholders (i.e. not the multiple-voting shares held by National Amusements) were given a 72% stake in the combined Entercom, CBS no longer owns or operates any radio stations directly; however, it still provides radio news broadcasts to its radio affiliates and the new owners of its former radio stations, and licenses the rights to use CBS trademarks under a long-term contract. The television network has over 240 owned-and-operated (O&amp;O) and affiliated television stations throughout the United States, some also available in Canada via pay-television providers or in border areas over-the-air.\nProgramming.\nAs of 2025[ [update]], CBS provides &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;87+1\u20442 hours of regularly scheduled network programming each week. The network provides 22 hours of primetime programming to affiliated stations Monday through Saturday from 8:00\u00a0p.m. to 11:00\u00a0p.m. and Sunday from 7:00\u00a0p.m. to 11:00\u00a0p.m. Eastern and Pacific time (7:00\u00a0p.m. to 10:00\u00a0p.m. Monday through Saturday and 6:00\u00a0p.m. to 10:00\u00a0p.m. on Sunday in Central/Mountain time).\nThe network also provides daytime programming from 11:00\u00a0a.m. to 4:00\u00a0p.m. Eastern and Pacific weekdays (subtract 1 hour for all other time zones), including a half-hour break for local news and features game shows \"The Price Is Right\" and \"Let's Make a Deal and\" soap operas \"The Young and the Restless,\" \"The Bold and the Beautiful\", and \"Beyond the Gates.\"\nCBS News programming includes \"CBS Mornings\" from 7:00\u00a0a.m. to 9:00\u00a0a.m. weekdays and \"CBS Saturday Morning\" in the same period on Saturdays; nightly editions of \"CBS Evening News\"; the Sunday political talk show \"Face the Nation\"; early morning news program \"CBS News Mornings\"; and the newsmagazines \"60 Minutes\", \"CBS News Sunday Morning\", and \"48 Hours\". On weeknights, CBS airs the talk show \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" (until May 2026) and reruns of the comedic game show \"After Midnight\" (until September 2025 with its replacement Comics Unleashed (reruns) filling the time slot until at least May 2026).\nCBS Sports programming is also provided most weekend afternoons. Due to the unpredictable length of sporting events, CBS occasionally delays scheduled primetime programs to allow the programs to air in their entirety, a practice most commonly seen with the NFL on CBS. In addition to rights to sports events from major sports organizations such as the NFL, PGA, and NCAA, CBS broadcasts the \"CBS Sports Spectacular\", a sports anthology series that fills certain weekend afternoon time slots before (or in some cases, in place of) a major sporting event.\nDaytime.\nCBS' daytime schedule is the longest among the major networks at &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;4+1\u20442 hours. It is the home of the long-running game show \"The Price Is Right\", which began production in 1972 and is the longest continuously running daytime game show on network television. After being hosted by Bob Barker for 35 years, the show has been hosted since 2007 by actor and comedian Drew Carey. The network is also home to the current incarnation of \"Let's Make a Deal\", hosted by singer and comedian Wayne Brady.\nCBS is the only commercial broadcast network that continues to broadcast daytime game shows. Notable game shows that once aired as part of the network's daytime lineup include \"Match Game\", \"Tattletales\", \"The $10/25,000 Pyramid\", \"Press Your Luck\", \"Card Sharks\", \"Family Feud\", and \"Wheel of Fortune\". Past game shows that have had both daytime and prime time runs on the network include \"Beat the Clock\" and \"To Tell the Truth\". Two long-running primetime-only games were the panel shows \"What's My Line?\" and \"I've Got a Secret\".\nThe network was also home to \"The Talk\", a panel talk show similar in format to ABC's \"The View\". It debuted in October 2010. The panel featured Sheryl Underwood, Amanda Kloots, Jerry O'Connell, Akbar Gbajabiamila, and Natalie Morales who served as moderator. \"The Talk\" officially ended its run on December 20, 2024.\nCBS Daytime airs three daytime soap operas each weekday: the hour-long series \"The Young and the Restless\", which debuted in 1973, and the half-hour series \"The Bold and the Beautiful\", which debuted in 1987 and hour-long series \"Beyond the Gates\" which debuted in 2025. CBS has long aired the most soap operas out of the Big Three networks, carrying &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3+1\u20442 hours of soaps on its daytime lineup from 1977 to 2009, and still retains the longest daily schedule. Other than \"Guiding Light\", notable daytime soap operas that once aired on CBS include \"As the World Turns\", \"Love of Life\", \"Search for Tomorrow\", \"The Secret Storm\", \"The Edge of Night\", and \"Capitol\".\nChildren's programming.\nCBS broadcast the live-action series \"Captain Kangaroo\" on weekday mornings from 1955 to 1982, and on Saturdays until 1984. From 1971 to 1986, CBS News produced a series of one-minute segments titled \"In the News\", which aired between other Saturday morning programs. Otherwise, CBS's children's programming has mostly focused on animated series such as reruns of \"Mighty Mouse\", \"Looney Tunes\", and \"Tom and Jerry\" cartoons, as well as \"Scooby-Doo\", \"Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids\", \"Jim Henson's Muppet Babies\", \"Garfield and Friends\", and \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\". In 1997, CBS premiered \"Wheel 2000\", a children's version of the syndicated game show \"Wheel of Fortune\" which aired simultaneously on the Game Show Network.\nIn September 1998, CBS began contracting the time out to other companies to provide programming and material for its Saturday morning schedule. The first of these outsourced blocks was the \"CBS Kidshow\", which ran until 2000 and featured programming from Canadian studio Nelvana such as \"Anatole\", \"Mythic Warriors\", \"Rescue Heroes\", and \"Flying Rhino Junior High\".\nAfter its agreement with Nelvana ended, the network then entered into a deal with Nickelodeon to air programming from its Nick Jr. block beginning in September 2000, under the banner Nick Jr. on CBS. By the time of the deal, Nickelodeon and CBS were corporate sisters through the latter's then parent company Viacom as a result of its 2000 merger with CBS Corporation. From 2002 to 2005, live-action and animated Nickelodeon series aimed at older children also aired as part of the block under the name Nick on CBS.\nFollowing the Viacom-CBS split, the network decided to discontinue the Nickelodeon content deal. In March 2006, CBS entered into a three-year agreement with DIC Entertainment, which was acquired later that year by the Cookie Jar Group, to program the Saturday morning time slot as part of a deal that included distribution of select tape-delayed Formula One auto races. The \"KOL Secret Slumber Party on CBS\" replaced \"Nick Jr. on CBS\" that September, with the inaugural lineup featuring two new first-run live-action programs, one animated series that originally aired in syndication in 2005, and three shows produced before 2006. In mid-2007, KOL, the children's service of AOL, withdrew sponsorship from CBS' Saturday morning block, which was subsequently renamed KEWLopolis. Complementing CBS's 2007 lineup were \"Care Bears\", \"Strawberry Shortcake\", and \"Sushi Pack\". On February 24, 2009, it was announced that CBS would renew its contract with Cookie Jar for another three seasons through 2012. On September 19, 2009, KEWLopolis was renamed Cookie Jar TV.\nOn July 24, 2013, CBS agreed with Litton Entertainment, which already programmed a syndicated Saturday morning block exclusive to ABC stations and later produced a block for CBS' sister network The CW that received its debut the following year, to launch a new Saturday morning block featuring live-action reality-based lifestyle, wildlife, and sports series. The Litton-produced CBS Dream Team block, aimed at teenagers 13 to 16 years old, began broadcasting on September 28, 2013, replacing Cookie Jar TV. The block was renamed CBS WKND in 2023.\nSpecials.\nAnimated primetime holiday specials.\nCBS was the original broadcast network home of the animated primetime holiday specials based on the \"Peanuts\" comic strip, beginning with \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\" in 1965. Over 30 holiday Peanuts specials (each for a specific holiday such as Halloween) were broadcast on CBS until 2000 when the broadcast rights were acquired by ABC. CBS also aired several primetime animated specials based on the works of Dr. Seuss (Theodor Geisel), beginning with \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\" in 1966, as well as several specials based on the \"Garfield\" comic strip during the 1980s (which led to Garfield getting his Saturday-morning cartoon on the network, \"Garfield and Friends\", which ran from 1988 to 1995). \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\", produced in stop motion by Rankin/Bass, has been another annual holiday staple of CBS; however, that special first aired on NBC in 1964. As of 2011[ [update]], \"Rudolph\" and \"Frosty the Snowman\" was the only two pre-1990 animated specials remaining on CBS; the broadcast rights to the \"Charlie Brown\" specials are now held by Apple, \"The Grinch\" rights by NBC, and the rights to the \"Garfield\" specials by Boomerang.\nAll of these animated specials, from 1973 to 1990, began with a fondly remembered seven-second animated opening sequence, in which the words \"A CBS Special Presentation\" were displayed in colorful lettering (the ITC Avant Garde typeface, widely used in the 1970s, was used for the title logo). The word \"SPECIAL\", in all caps and repeated multiple times in multiple colors, slowly zoomed out from the frame in a spinning counterclockwise motion against a black background, and rapidly zoomed back into frame as a single word, in white, at the end; the sequence was accompanied by a jazzy though majestic up-tempo fanfare with dramatic horns and percussion (which was edited incidental music from the CBS crime drama \"Hawaii Five-O\", titled \"Call to Danger\" on the Capitol Records soundtrack LP). This opening sequence appeared immediately before all CBS specials of the period (such as the Miss USA pageants and the annual presentation of the Kennedy Center Honors), in addition to animated specials.\nClassical music specials.\nCBS was also responsible for airing the series of \"Young People's Concerts\", conducted by Leonard Bernstein. Telecast every few months between 1958 and 1972, first in black-and-white and then in color beginning in 1966, these programs introduced millions of children to classical music through the eloquent commentaries of Bernstein. The specials were nominated for several Emmy Awards, including two wins in 1961 and later in 1966, and were among the first programs ever broadcast from the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts.\nOver the years, CBS has broadcast three different productions of Tchaikovsky's ballet \"The Nutcracker\" \u2013 two live telecasts of the George Balanchine New York City Ballet production in 1957 and 1958 respectively, a little-known German-American filmed production in 1965 (which was subsequently repeated three times and starred Edward Villella, Patricia McBride and Melissa Hayden), and beginning in 1977, the Mikhail Baryshnikov staging of the ballet, starring the Russian dancer along with Gelsey Kirkland \u2013 a version that would become a television classic, and remains so today (the broadcast of this production later moved to PBS).\nIn April 1986, CBS presented a slightly abbreviated version of \"Horowitz in Moscow\", a live piano recital by pianist Vladimir Horowitz, which marked his return to Russia after over 60 years. The recital was televised as an episode of \"CBS News Sunday Morning\" (televised at 9:00\u00a0a.m. Eastern Time in the U.S., as the recital was performed simultaneously at 4:00\u00a0p.m. in Russia). It was so successful that CBS repeated it a mere two months later by popular demand, this time on videotape, rather than live. In later years, the program was shown as a standalone special on PBS; the current DVD of the telecast omits the commentary by Charles Kuralt but includes additional selections not heard on the CBS telecast.\nIn 1986, CBS telecast \"Carnegie Hall: The Grand Reopening\" in primetime, in what was then a rare move for a commercial broadcast network, since most primetime classical music specials were relegated to PBS and A&amp;E by this time. The program was a concert commemorating the re-opening of Carnegie Hall after its complete renovation. A range of artists were featured, from classical conductor Leonard Bernstein to popular music singer Frank Sinatra.\n\"Cinderella\".\nTo compete with NBC, which produced the televised version of the Mary Martin Broadway production of \"Peter Pan\", CBS responded with a musical production of \"Cinderella\", with music by Richard Rodgers and lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II. Based upon the classic Charles Perrault fairy tale, it is the only Rodgers and Hammerstein musical to have been written for television. It was originally broadcast live in color on CBS on March 31, 1957, as a vehicle for Julie Andrews, who played the title role; that broadcast was seen by over 100 million people. It was subsequently remade by CBS in 1965, with Lesley Ann Warren, Stuart Damon, Ginger Rogers, and Walter Pidgeon among its stars; the remake also included the new song \"Loneliness of Evening\", which was originally composed in 1949 for \"South Pacific\" but was not performed in that musical. This version was rebroadcast several times on CBS into the early 1970s, and is occasionally broadcast on various cable networks to this day; both versions are available on DVD.\nNational Geographic.\nCBS was also the original broadcast home for the primetime specials produced by the National Geographic Society. The Geographic series in the U.S. started on CBS in 1964, before moving to ABC in 1973 (the specials subsequently moved to PBS \u2013 under the production of Pittsburgh member station WQED \u2013 in 1975 and NBC in 1995, before returning to PBS in 2000). The specials have featured stories on many scientific figures such as Louis Leakey, Jacques Cousteau, and Jane Goodall, that not only featured their work but helped make them internationally known and accessible to millions. A majority of the specials were narrated by various actors, notably Alexander Scourby during the CBS run. The success of the specials led in part to the creation of the National Geographic Channel, a cable channel launched in January 2001 as a joint venture between the National Geographic Society and Fox Cable Networks. The specials' distinctive theme music, by Elmer Bernstein, was also adopted by the National Geographic Channel.\nOther notable specials.\nFrom 1949 to 2002, the Pillsbury Bake-Off, an annual national cooking contest, was broadcast on CBS as a special. Hosts for the broadcast included Arthur Godfrey, Art Linkletter, Bob Barker, Gary Collins, Willard Scott (although under contract with CBS' rival NBC), and Alex Trebek.\nThe Miss USA beauty pageant aired on CBS from 1963 to 2002, during a large portion of that period, the telecast was often emceed by the host of one of CBS's game shows including Bob Barker from 1967 to 1987 (at which point Barker, an animal rights activist who eventually convinced producers of \"The Price Is Right\" to cease offering fur coats as prizes on the program, quit in a dispute over their use), succeed by Alan Thicke in 1988, Dick Clark from 1989 to 1993, and Bob Goen from 1994 to 1996. The pageant's highest viewership was recorded in the early 1980s when it regularly topped the Nielsen ratings on the week of its broadcast. Viewership dropped sharply throughout the 1990s and 2000s, from an estimated viewership of 20 million to an average of 7 million from 2000 to 2001. In 2002, Donald Trump (owner of the Miss USA pageant's governing body, the Miss Universe Organization) brokered a new deal with NBC, giving it half-ownership of the Miss USA, Miss Universe and Miss Teen USA pageants and moving them to that network as part of an initial five-year contract, which began in 2003 and ended in 2015 after 12 years amid Trump's controversial remarks about Mexican immigrants during the launch of his 2016 campaign for the Republican presidential nomination.\nOn June 1, 1977, it was announced that Elvis Presley had signed a deal with CBS to appear in a new television special. Under the agreement, CBS would videotape Presley's concerts during the summer of 1977; the special was filmed during Presley's final tour at stops in Omaha, Nebraska (on June 19) and Rapid City, South Dakota (on June 21 of that year). CBS aired the special, \"Elvis in Concert\", on October 3, 1977, nearly two months after Presley died in his Graceland mansion on August 16.\nSince its inception in 1978, CBS has been the sole broadcaster of The Kennedy Center Honors, a two-hour performing arts tribute typically taped and edited in December for later broadcast during the holiday season.\nStations.\nCBS has 15 owned-and-operated stations, and current and pending affiliation agreements with 228 additional television stations encompassing 50 states, the District of Columbia, two U.S. possessions (Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands) and Bermuda and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The network has a national reach of 95.96% of all households in the United States (or 299,861,665 Americans with at least one television set). Currently, New Jersey, New Hampshire and Delaware are the only U.S. states where CBS does not have a locally licensed affiliate (New Jersey is served by New York City O&amp;O WCBS-TV and Philadelphia O&amp;O KYW-TV; Delaware is served by KYW and Salisbury, Maryland, affiliate WBOC-TV; and New Hampshire is served by Boston O&amp;O WBZ-TV and Burlington, Vermont, affiliate WCAX-TV).\nCBS maintains affiliations with low-power stations (broadcasting either in analog or digital) in a few markets, such as Harrisonburg, Virginia (WSVF-CD), Palm Springs, California (KPSP-CD), and Parkersburg, West Virginia (WIYE-LD). In some markets, including both of those mentioned, these stations also maintain digital simulcasts on a subchannel of a co-owned/co-managed full-power television station. CBS also maintains a sizeable number of subchannel-only affiliations, the majority of which are with stations in cities located outside of the 50 largest Nielsen-designated markets; the largest CBS subchannel affiliate by market size is KOGG in Wailuku, Hawaii, which serves as a repeater of Honolulu affiliate KGMB (the sister station of KOGG parent KHNL).\nNexstar Media Group is the largest operator of CBS stations by numerical total, owning 49 CBS affiliates (counting satellites); Tegna Media is the largest operator of CBS stations in terms of overall market reach, owning 15 CBS-affiliated stations (including affiliates in the larger markets in Houston, Tampa and Washington, D.C.) that reach 8.9% of the country.\nRelated services.\nVideo-on-demand services.\nCBS provides video-on-demand access for delayed viewing of the network's programming through various means, including via its website at CBS.com; the network's apps for iOS, Android, and newer version Windows devices; a traditional VOD service called CBS on Demand available on most traditional cable and IPTV providers; and through content deals with Amazon Video (which holds exclusive streaming rights to the CBS drama series \"Extant\" and \"Under the Dome\") and Netflix. Notably, however, CBS is the only major broadcast network that does not provide recent episodes of its programming on Hulu (sister network The CW does offer its programming on the streaming service, albeit on a one-week delay after becoming available on the network's website on Hulu's free service, with users of its subscription service being granted access to newer episodes of CW series eight hours after their initial broadcast), due to concerns over cannibalizing viewership of some of the network's most prominent programs; however, episode back catalogs of certain past and present CBS series are available on the service through an agreement with CBS Television Distribution.\nUpon the release of the app in March 2013, CBS restricted streaming of the most recent episode of any of the network's programs on its streaming app for Apple iOS devices until eight days after their initial broadcast to encourage live or same-week (via both DVR and cable on demand) viewing; programming selections on the app were limited until the release of its Google Play and Windows 8 apps in October 2013, expanded the selections to include full episodes of all CBS series to which the network does not license the streaming rights to other services.\nParamount+ (formerly CBS All Access).\nOn October 28, 2014, CBS launched CBS All Access, an over-the-top subscription streaming service \u2013 priced at $5.99 per month ($9.99 with the no commercials option) \u2013 which allows users to view past and present episodes of CBS shows. Announced on October 16, 2014 (one day after HBO announced the launch of its over-the-top service HBO Now) as the first OTT offering by a USA broadcast television network, the service initially encompassed the network's existing streaming portal at CBS.com and its mobile app for smartphones and tablet computers; CBS All Access became available on Roku on April 7, 2015, and on Chromecast on May 14, 2015. In addition to providing full-length episodes of CBS programs, the service allows live programming streams of local CBS affiliates in 124 markets reaching 75% of the United States.\nCBS All Access offered the most recent episodes of the network's shows the day after their original broadcast, as well as complete back catalogs of most of its current series and a wide selection of episodes of classic series from the CBS Television Distribution and ViacomCBS Domestic Media Networks program library to subscribers of the service. CBS All Access also carried behind-the-scenes features from CBS programs and special events.\nOriginal programs aired on CBS All Access included ', \"The Good Fight\", and '.\nIn December 2018, the service was launched in Australia under the name 10 All Access, due to its affiliation with CBS-owned free-to-air broadcaster Network 10. Due to local programming rights, not all content is shared with its U.S. counterpart, whilst the Australian version also features numerous full seasons of local Network 10 shows, all commercial-free.\nIt was announced in September 2020 that the service would be rebranded as Paramount+ in early 2021, and would feature content from the wider ViacomCBS library following the re-merger between CBS and Viacom. The name was also extended to international markets and services such as 10 All Access. The rebrand to Paramount+ took place on March 4, 2021.\nCBS HD.\nCBS' master feed is transmitted in 1080i high definition, the native resolution format for CBS Corporation's television properties. However, seven of its affiliates transmit the network's programming in 720p HD, while seven others carry the network feed in 480i standard definition either due to technical considerations for affiliates of other major networks that carry CBS programming on a digital subchannel or because a primary feed CBS affiliate has not yet upgraded their transmission equipment to allow content to be presented in HD. A small number of CBS stations and affiliates are also currently broadcasting at 1080p via an ATSC 3.0 multiplex station to simulcast a station's programming such as WNCN through WRDC in Durham, North Carolina, WTVF through WUXP-TV in Nashville, and KLAS-TV through KVCW in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nCBS began its conversion to high definition with the launch of its simulcast feed CBS HD in September 1998, at the start of the 1998\u201399 season. That year, CBS aired the first NFL game broadcast in high-definition, with the telecast of the New York Jets\u2013Buffalo Bills game on November 8. CBS gradually converted much of its existing programming from standard definition to high definition beginning with the 2000\u201301 season, with select shows among that season's slate of freshmen scripted series being broadcast in HD starting with their debuts. \"The Young and the Restless\" became the first daytime soap opera to broadcast in HD on June 27, 2001.\nCBS' 14-year conversion to an entirely high-definition schedule ended in 2014, with \"Big Brother\" and \"Let's Make a Deal\" becoming the final two series to convert from standard definition to HD (in contrast, NBC, Fox, and The CW were already airing their entire programming schedules \u2013 outside of Saturday mornings \u2013 in high definition by the 2010\u201311 season, while ABC was broadcasting its entire schedule in HD by the 2011\u201312 midseason). All of the network's programming has been presented in full HD since then (except for certain holiday specials produced before 2005 \u2013 such as the Rankin-Bass specials \u2013 which continue to be presented in 4:3 SD, although some have been remastered for HD broadcast).\nOn September 1, 2016, when ABC converted to a widescreen presentation, CBS and The CW were the only remaining networks that framed their promotions and on-screen graphical elements for a presentation, though with CBS Sports' \"de facto\" 16:9 conversion with Super Bowl 50 and their new graphical presentation designed for 16:9 framing, in practice, most CBS affiliates ask pay-TV providers to pass down a 16:9 widescreen presentation by default over their standard definition channels. This continued for CBS until September 24, 2018, when the network converted its on-screen graphical elements to a 16:9 widescreen presentation for all non-news and sports programs. Litton Entertainment continues to frame the graphical elements in their programs for \"Dream Team\" within a 4:3 frame due to them being positioned for future syndicated sales, though all of its programming has been in high definition.\nBranding.\nLogos.\nThe CBS television network's initial logo, used from the 1940s to 1951, consisted of an oval spotlight which shone on the block letters \"CBS\". The present-day Eye device was conceived by William Golden, based on a Pennsylvania Dutch hex sign and a Shaker drawing. While the logo is commonly attributed to Golden, some design work may have been done by CBS staff designer Georg Olden, one of the first African-Americans to attract some attention in the postwar graphic design field. The Eye device made its broadcast debut on October 20, 1951. The following season, as Golden prepared a new \"ident\", CBS President Frank Stanton insisted on keeping the Eye device and using it as much as possible. Golden died unexpectedly in 1959, and was replaced by Lou Dorfsman, one of his top assistants, who would go on to oversee all print and on-air graphics for CBS for the next 30 years.\nThe CBS eye has since become a widely recognized symbol. While the logo has been used in different ways, the Eye device itself has never been redesigned. As part of a then-new graphical identity created by Trollb\u00e4ck + Company that was used by the network during the 2006\u20132007 network television season, the eye was placed in a \"trademark\" position on show titles, days of the week and descriptive words, an approach highly respecting the value of the design. The logo is alternately known as the \"Eyemark\", a branding used for CBS's domestic television syndication division, under the Eyemark Entertainment name, in the mid-to-late 1990s after Westinghouse Electric bought CBS, but before the King World acquisition (which Eyemark was folded into), and subsequent merger with Viacom; Eyemark Entertainment was the result of the merger of MaXaM Entertainment (an independent television syndication firm which Westinghouse acquired shortly after its merger with CBS in 1996), Group W Productions (Westinghouse Broadcasting's own syndication division), &amp; CBS Enterprises (CBS's syndication arm from the late 1960s to the early 1970s).\nThe eye logo has served as inspiration for the logos of Associated Television (ATV) in the United Kingdom, Canal 4 in El Salvador, Televisa in Mexico, France 3, Latina Televisi\u00f3n in Peru, Fuji Television in Japan, Rede Bandeirantes and TV Globo in Brazil, and Canal 10 in Uruguay.\nIn October 2011, the network celebrated the 60th anniversary of the introduction of the Eye logo, featuring special IDs of logo versions from previous CBS image campaigns being shown during the network's primetime lineup.\nCBS historically used a specially-commissioned variant of Didot, a close relative to Bodoni, as its corporate font until 2021.\nImage campaigns.\n1980s.\nCBS has developed several notable image campaigns, and several of the network's most well-known slogans were introduced in the 1980s. The \"Reach for the Stars\" campaign used during the 1981\u201382 season features a space theme to capitalize on both CBS's stellar improvement in the ratings and the historic launch of the space shuttle Columbia. 1982's \"Great Moments\" juxtaposed scenes from classic CBS programs such as \"I Love Lucy\" with scenes from the network's then-current classics such as \"Dallas\" and \"M*A*S*H\". From 1983 to 1986, CBS (by now firmly atop the ratings) featured a campaign based on the slogan \"We've Got the Touch\". Vocals for the campaign's jingle were contributed by Richie Havens (1983\u201384; one occasion in 1984\u201385) and Kenny Rogers (1985\u201386).\nThe 1986\u201387 season ushered in the \"Share the Spirit of CBS\" campaign, the network's first to completely use computer graphics and digital video effects. Unlike most network campaign promos, the full-length version of \"Share the Spirit\" not only showed a brief clip preview of each new fall series but also utilized CGI effects to map out the entire fall schedule by night. The success of that campaign led to the 1987\u201388 \"CBS Spirit\" (or \"CBSPIRIT\") campaign. Like its predecessor, most \"CBSpirit\" promos utilized a procession of clips from the network's programs. However, the new graphic motif was a swirling (or \"swishing\") blue line that was used to represent \"the spirit\". The full-length promo, like the previous year, had a special portion that identified new fall shows, but the mapped-out fall schedule shot was abandoned.\nFor the 1988\u201389 season, CBS unveiled a new image campaign officially known as \"Television You Can Feel\", but more commonly identified as \"You Can Feel It On CBS\". The goal was to convey a more sensual, new-age image through distinguished, advanced-looking computer graphics and soothing music, backgrounding images, and clips of emotionally powerful scenes and characters. However, it was this season in which CBS saw its ratings freefall, the deepest in the network's history. CBS ended the decade with \"Get Ready for CBS\", introduced with the 1989\u201390 season. The initial version was an ambitious campaign that attempted to elevate CBS out of last place (among the major networks); the motif centered around network stars interacting with each other in a remote studio set, getting ready for photo and television shoots, as well as for the new season on CBS. The high-energy promo song and the campaign's practices saw many customized variations by all of CBS's owned-and-operated stations and affiliates, which participated in the campaign per a network mandate. In addition, for the first time in history, CBS became the first broadcast network to partner with a national retailer (in this case, Kmart) to encourage viewership, with the \"CBS/Kmart Get Ready Giveaway\".\n1990s.\nFor the 1990\u201391 season, the campaign featured a new jingle performed by the Temptations, which featured an altered version of their hit \"Get Ready\". The early 1990s featured less-than-memorable campaigns, with simplified taglines such as \"This is CBS\" (1992) and \"You're on CBS\" (1995). Eventually, the promotions department gained momentum again late in the decade with \"Welcome Home to a CBS Night\" (1996\u20131997), shortened to \"Welcome Home\" (1997\u20131999), and succeeded by the spin-off campaign \"The Address is CBS\" (1999\u20132000), whose history can be traced back to a CBS slogan from the radio era of the 1940s, \"The Stars' Address is CBS\". During the 1992 season for the end-of-show network identification sequence, a four-note sound mark was introduced, which was eventually adapted into the network's IDs and production company vanity cards following the closing credits of most of its programs during the \"Welcome Home\" era.\n2000s.\nThroughout the 2000s, CBS' rating resurgence was backed by the network's \"It's All Here\" campaign (which introduced updated versions of the 1992 sound mark used during certain promotions and production company vanity cards during the closing credits of programs); in 2005 campaign introduced the slogan \"Everybody's Watching\", the network's strategy led to the proclamation that it was \"America's Most Watched Network\". The network's 2006 campaign introduced the slogan \"We Are CBS\", with Don LaFontaine providing the voiceover for the IDs (as well as certain network promos) during this period. In 2009, the network introduced a campaign entitled \"Only CBS\", in which network promotions proclaim several unique qualities it has (the slogan was also used in program promotions following the announcement of the timeslot of a particular program). The \"America's Most Watched Network\" was re-introduced by CBS in 2011, used alongside the \"Only CBS\" slogan.\n2020s.\nIn October 2020, CBS announced that it would begin to employ a more unified branding between the network and its divisions to strengthen brand awareness across platforms. The two main components of the rebranding are a \"deconstructed eye\" motif using the individual shapes of the eyemark (such as an animated station ID), and a five-note sound trademark developed by the audio design agency Antfood, phonetically resembling the \"This is CBS\" slogan.\nAlongside the rebranding, CBS Television Studios was renamed CBS Studios, and CBS Television Distribution was renamed CBS Media Ventures. The network also dropped the \"America's Most Watched Network\" and \"Only CBS\" taglines, with chief marketing officer Michael Benson explaining that they aimed to \"be something where people feel like they are part of the family. It's tough to unify if you're bragging about yourself.\" Due to its programming being licensed to third-party streaming services, CBS programming began to carry a CBS Studios production logo based on the ident when applicable, and are billed with \"CBS Original\" or \"CBS Presents\" (specials) bylines in promotional material.\nAs part of the rebranding, CBS News and CBS Sports also introduced new logos and imaging incorporating the deconstructed eye motif and sonic branding, with CBS News initially using it for coverage of the 2020 presidential election, and CBS Sports launching its rebrand ahead of Super Bowl LV in 2021. In December 2022, CBS News and Stations began to deploy the branding on the local news operations of CBS's owned-and-operated stations, with most now being branded as \"CBS News (region)\" to align themselves with CBS News and its chain of local streaming news channels (with some exceptions in markets with heritage station brands, such as KPIX) and adopting new graphics and music incorporating the eye motif and sound mark (replacing Frank Gari's \"Enforcer\" music package, which was based on a theme historically used by WBBM-TV).\nInternational broadcasts.\nCBS programs are shown outside the United States: through various Paramount Global international networks and/or content agreements, and in two North American countries, through U.S.-based CBS stations. Sky News broadcasts the \"CBS Evening News\" on its channels serving the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and Italy.\nCanada.\nIn Canada, CBS network programming is carried on cable, satellite, and IPTV providers through affiliates and owned-and-operated stations of the network that are located within proximity to the Canada\u2013United States border (such as KIRO-TV in Seattle; KBJR-DT2 in Duluth, Minnesota: WWJ-TV in Detroit; WIVB-TV in Buffalo, New York; and WCAX-TV in Burlington, Vermont), some of which may also be receivable over-the-air in parts of southern Canada depending on the signal coverage of the station. Most programming is generally the same as it airs in the United States; however, some CBS programming on U.S.-based affiliates permitted for carriage by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission by Canadian cable and satellite providers are subject to simultaneous substitutions, a practice in which a pay television provider supplants an American station's signal with a feed from a Canadian station/network airing a particular program in the same time slot to protect domestic advertising revenue.\nBermuda.\nIn Bermuda, CBS maintains an affiliation with Hamilton-based ZBM-TV, locally owned by Bermuda Broadcasting Company.\nMexico.\nCBS programming is available in Mexico through affiliates in markets located within proximity to the Mexico\u2013United States border (such as KYMA-DT/Yuma, Arizona; KVTV/Laredo, Texas; KDBC-TV/El Paso, Texas; KVEO-DT2/Brownsville/Harlingen/McAllen, Texas; and KFMB-TV/San Diego), whose signals are readily receivable over-the-air in border areas of northern Mexico.\nCentral America, the Dominican Republic and the Caribbean.\nIn Central America, the Dominican Republic and the Caribbean, many subscription providers carry either select U.S.-based CBS-affiliated stations or the main network feed from CBS O&amp;Os WCBS-TV in New York City or WFOR-TV in Miami. In addition, network's programming has been available in the U.S. Virgin Islands since 2019 on WCVI-TV in Christiansted (owned by Lilly Broadcasting).\nGuam.\nIn the U.S. territory of Guam, the network is affiliated with low-power station KUAM-LP in Hag\u00e5t\u00f1a. Entertainment and non-breaking news programming is shown day and date on a one-day broadcast delay, as Guam is located on the west side of the International Date Line (for example, \"NCIS\", which airs on Tuesday nights, is carried on Wednesdays on KUAM-LP, and is advertised by the station as airing on the latter night in on-air promotions), with live programming and breaking news coverage airing as scheduled, meaning live sports coverage often airs early in the morning.\nPuerto Rico.\nIn the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, CBS is carried through a special feed of Erie, Pennsylvania affiliate WSEE-TV, relayed via Mayag\u00fcez-based translator W22FA-D.\nSouth America.\nIn Ecuador, Peru, Argentina, Venezuela, Colombia and Brazil, many subscription providers carry either select U.S.-based CBS-affiliated stations or the main network feed from CBS O&amp;Os WCBS-TV in New York City or WFOR-TV in Miami.\nUnited Kingdom.\nOn September 14, 2009, the international arm of CBS, CBS Studios International, reached a joint venture deal with Chellomedia to launch six CBS-branded channels in the United Kingdom \u2013 which would respectively replace Zone Romantica, Zone Thriller, Zone Horror, and Zone Reality, as well as timeshift services Zone Horror +1 and Zone Reality +1 \u2013 during the fourth quarter of that year. On October 1, 2009, it was announced that the first four channels, CBS Reality, CBS Reality +1, CBS Drama, and CBS Action (later CBS Justice), would launch on November 16 respectively replacing Zone Reality, Zone Reality +1, Zone Romantica and Zone Thriller. On April 5, 2010, Zone Horror and Zone Horror +1 were rebranded as Horror Channel and Horror Channel +1.\nCBS News and BBC News have maintained a news-sharing agreement since 2017, replacing the BBC's longtime agreement with ABC News and CBS' with Sky News (which would have ended in any event in 2018 due to that entity's purchase by NBCUniversal).\nAs of the close of the Viacom merger on December 4, 2019, Channel 5 is now a sister operation to CBS, though no major changes to CBS' relationship with the BBC are expected shortly, as Channel 5 sub-contracts its news programming obligations to ITN.\nAustralia.\nAustralian free-to-air broadcaster Network 10 has been owned by CBS Corporation since 2017 (and subsequently, Paramount Global). Network 10's channels, 10, 10 Comedy, 10 Drama, and Nickelodeon, all carry CBS programming, with the latter drawing extensively from the wider Paramount Global library including MTV and Nickelodeon. Before the acquisition, CBS had long been a major supplier of international programs to the network. The cost of maintaining program supply agreements with CBS and 21st Century Fox was a major factor in the network's unprofitability during the mid-2010s. Network Ten entered voluntary administration in June 2017. CBS Corporation was the network's largest creditor. CBS Corporation chose to acquire the network, completing the transaction in November 2017.\nAsia.\nHong Kong.\nIn Hong Kong, the \"CBS Evening News\" was initially broadcast live during the early morning hours on ATV World and replayed on International Business Channel from i-CABLE HOY; networks in that country maintain an agreement to rebroadcast portions of the program 12 hours after the initial broadcast to provide additional content in case their affiliates have insufficient news content to fill time during their local news programs.\nPhilippines.\nIn the Philippines, \"CBS Evening News\" is broadcast on satellite network Q (a sister channel of GMA Network which is now GTV), while \"CBS This Morning\" is shown in that country on Lifestyle (now Metro Channel). Several CBS entertainment programs such as \"CSI\", \"Late Show with David Letterman\", and \"Survivor\" Series are broadcast by Studio 23 (now S+A) and Maxxx, which are both owned by ABS-CBN Corporation. 60 Minutes is currently broadcast on CNN Philippines as a part of their Stories block, which includes documentaries and is broadcast on Wednesday at 8:00\u00a0p.m. before CNN Philippines Nightly News with replays in a capacity as a stand-alone program on Saturdays at 8:00\u00a0a.m. &amp; 5:00 pm and Sundays at 6:00 a.m, all in local time (UTC + 8).\nIndia.\nIn India, CBS maintained a brand licensing agreement with Reliance Broadcast Network Ltd. for three CBS-branded channels: Big CBS Prime, Big CBS Spark, and Big CBS Love. These channels were shut down in late November 2013. Following the CBS-Viacom merger, the Hindi-language general entertainment channel Colors TV became a sister network to CBS through the Viacom18 joint venture with TV18.\nIsrael.\nIn Israel, in 2012 the channels Zone Reality and Zone Romantica were rebranded as CBS Reality and CBS Drama, respectively. The channels were carried by Israeli television providers Yes and Hot, although as of 2018[ [update]] they both only carry CBS Reality.\nControversies.\n\"Gay Power, Gay Politics\".\nOn April 26, 1980, CBS aired \"Gay Power, Gay Politics\", an episode of the \"CBS Reports\" documentary series which purported to document the growing political significance of the LGBTQ community in San Francisco. The documentary was accused of purposeful misrepresentation and propagating misinformation, including in its coverage of the 1979 mayoral election. In spite of the documentary's premise, the episode focused largely on gay sexual practices and among other claims, alleged that 10% of deaths in San Francisco were related to BDSM. Journalist George Crile III also attempted to initiate an interview with then mayor Dianne Feinstein by asking her \"how does it feel to be the mayor of Sodom and Gomorrah?\" The documentary was aired at a time when the Christian right in the United States sought to use homophobic sentiment as a political tactic. Six months after the episode aired, the National News Council, in response to a complaint by journalist Randy Alfred, found that CBS had violated journalistic standards in airing the program.\nBrown &amp; Williamson interview.\nIn 1995, CBS refused to air a \"60 Minutes\" segment that featured an interview with a former president of research and development for Brown &amp; Williamson, the U.S.'s third largest tobacco company. The controversy raised questions about the legal roles in decision-making and whether journalistic standards should be compromised despite legal pressures and threats. The decision nevertheless sent shockwaves throughout the television industry, the journalism community, and the country. This incident was the basis for the 1999 Michael Mann-directed drama film, \"The Insider\".\nSuper Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy.\nIn 2004, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) imposed a record $550,000 fine, the largest fine ever for a violation of federal decency laws, against CBS for an incident during its broadcast of Super Bowl XXXVIII in which singer Janet Jackson's right breast (which was partially covered by a piece of nipple jewelry) was briefly and accidentally exposed by guest performer Justin Timberlake at the end of a duet performance of Timberlake's 2003 single \"Rock Your Body\" during the halftime show (produced by then sister cable network MTV). Following the incident, CBS apologized to its viewers and denied foreknowledge of the incident, which was televised live. The incident resulted in a period of increased regulation of broadcast television and radio outlets (including self-imposed content regulation by networks and syndicators), which raised concerns surrounding censorship and freedom of speech, and resulted in the FCC voting to increase its maximum fine for indecency violations from US$27,500 to US$325,000. In 2008, a Philadelphia federal court annulled the fine imposed on CBS, labeling it \"arbitrary and capricious\".\nKillian documents controversy.\nOn September 8, 2004, less than two months before the Presidential election in which he defeated Democratic candidate John Kerry, CBS aired a controversial episode of \"60 Minutes Wednesday\", which questioned then-President George W. Bush's service in the Air National Guard in 1972 and 1973. Following allegations of forgery, CBS News admitted that four of the documents used in the story had not been properly authenticated and admitted that their source, Bill Burkett, had admitted to having \"deliberately misled\" a CBS News producer who worked on the report, about the documents' origins out of a confidentiality promise to the actual source. The following January, CBS fired four people connected to the preparation of the segment. Former CBS news anchor Dan Rather filed a $70\u00a0million lawsuit against CBS and former corporate parent Viacom in September 2007, contending the story, and his termination (he resigned as CBS News chief anchor in 2005), were mishandled. Parts of the suit were dismissed in 2008; subsequently in 2010, the entire suit was dismissed and Rather's motion to appeal was denied.\nHopper controversy.\nIn January 2013, CNET named Dish Network's \"Hopper with Sling\" digital video recorder as a nominee for the CES \"Best in Show\" award (which is decided by CNET on behalf of its organizers, the Consumer Electronics Association), and named it the winner in a vote by the site's staff. However, CBS division CBS Interactive disqualified the Hopper and vetoed the results as CBS was in active litigation with Dish Network over its AutoHop technology (which allows users to skip commercial advertisements during recorded programs). CNET announced that it would no longer review any product or service provided by companies that CBS Corporation was in litigation with. The \"Best in Show\" award was instead given to the Razer Edge tablet. On January 14, 2013, CNET editor-in-chief Lindsey Turrentine said in a statement that its staff was in an \"impossible\" situation due to the conflict of interest posed by the lawsuit, and promised to prevent a similar incident from occurring again. The conflict also prompted the resignation of CNET senior writer Greg Sandoval. As a result of the controversy, the CEA announced on January 31, 2013, that CNET will no longer decide the CES Best in Show award winner due to the interference of CBS (with the position being offered to other technology publications), and the \"Best in Show\" award was jointly awarded to both the Hopper with Sling and Razer Edge.\nHarassment allegations.\nIn July 2018, an article by Ronan Farrow in \"The New Yorker\" claimed that thirty \"current and former CBS employees described harassment, gender discrimination, or retaliation\" at CBS and six women accused Les Moonves of harassment and intimidation. Following these allegations, it was reported on September 6, 2018, that CBS board members were negotiating Les Moonves's departure from the company.\nOn September 9, 2018, \"The New Yorker\" reported that six additional women (in addition to the six original women reported in July) had raised accusations against Moonves, going back to the 1980s. Following this, Moonves resigned the same day as chief executive of CBS.\nAlleged capitulation to Donald Trump Administration.\nIn 2025, some criticized CBS for seeming to capitulate to the second Donald Trump administration, allegedly in part to gain federal government approval for the Skydance-Paramount merger.\nIn April, in response to a lawsuit filed by Trump, 60 Minutes editor Bill Owens resigned, saying \"he no longer has control of the show.\"\nOn July 17, Stephen Colbert announced that his version of the Late Show was cancelled effective May 2026 at the conclusion of his current contract, and that the entire Late Show franchise would be retired at this time. While CBS called the decision \"purely financial\", many were skeptical of the network's true motivations about ending the long-running late night program, especially as the decision came almost immediately after Colbert had publicly called CBS's $16 million payment to the Trump Administration \"a big fat bribe\", the pending Skydance merger was approved soon after by the Trump-controlled FCC, and Trump publicly celebrated Colbert's firing. Other late night hosts spoke out in support of Colbert, with several appearing in cameo roles on the July 20 episode of the Late Show to offer their support.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "37654", "revid": "48643156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37654", "title": "Owl", "text": "Birds from the order Strigiformes\nOwls are birds from the order Strigiformes (), which includes over 200 species of mostly solitary and nocturnal birds of prey typified by an upright stance, a large, broad head, binocular vision, binaural hearing, sharp talons, and feathers adapted for silent flight. Exceptions include the diurnal northern hawk-owl and the gregarious burrowing owl.\nOwls are divided into two families: the true (or typical) owl family, Strigidae, and the barn owl and bay owl family, Tytonidae. Owls hunt mostly small mammals, insects, and other birds, although a few species specialize in hunting fish. They are found in all regions of the Earth except the polar ice caps and some remote islands.\nA group of owls is called a \"parliament\".\nAnatomy.\nOwls possess large, forward-facing eyes and ear-holes, a hawk-like beak, a flat face, and usually a conspicuous circle of feathers, a facial disc, around each eye. The feathers making up this disc can be adjusted to sharply focus sounds from varying distances onto the owls' asymmetrically placed ear cavities. Most birds of prey have eyes on the sides of their heads, but the stereoscopic nature of the owl's forward-facing eyes permits the greater sense of depth perception necessary for low-light hunting. Owls have binocular vision, but they must rotate their entire heads to change the focus of their view because, like most birds, their eyes are fixed in their sockets. Owls are farsighted and cannot clearly see anything nearer than a few centimetres of their eyes. Caught prey can be felt by owls with the use of filoplumes\u2014hairlike feathers on the beak and feet that act as \"feelers\". Their far vision, particularly in low light, is exceptionally good.\nOwls can rotate their heads and necks as much as 270\u00b0. Owls have 14 neck vertebrae\u2014humans have only seven\u2014and their vertebral circulatory systems are adapted to allow them to rotate their heads without cutting off blood to the brain. Specifically, the foramina in their vertebrae through which the vertebral arteries pass are about ten times the diameter of the artery, instead of about the same size as the artery, as is the case in humans; the vertebral arteries enter the cervical vertebrae higher than in other birds, giving the vessels some slack, and the carotid arteries unite in a very large anastomosis or junction, the largest of any bird's, preventing blood supply from being cut off while they rotate their necks. Other anastomoses between the carotid and vertebral arteries support this effect.\nThe smallest owl\u2014weighing as little as and measuring some \u2014is the elf owl (\"Micrathene whitneyi\"). Around the same diminutive length, although slightly heavier, are the lesser known long-whiskered owlet (\"Xenoglaux loweryi\") and Tamaulipas pygmy owl (\"Glaucidium sanchezi\"). The largest owls are two similarly sized species; the Eurasian eagle-owl (\"Bubo bubo\") and Blakiston's fish owl (\"Ketupa blakistoni\"). The largest females of these species are long, have a wing span, and weigh .\nDifferent species of owls produce different sounds; this distribution of calls aids owls in finding mates or announcing their presence to potential competitors, and also aids ornithologists and birders in locating these birds and distinguishing species. As noted above, their facial discs help owls to funnel the sound of prey to their ears. In many species, these discs are placed asymmetrically, for better directional location.\nOwl plumage is generally cryptic, although several species have facial and head markings, including face masks, ear tufts, and brightly colored irises. These markings are generally more common in species inhabiting open habitats, and are thought to be used in signaling with other owls in low-light conditions.\nSexual dimorphism.\nSexual dimorphism is a physical difference between males and females of a species. Female owls are typically larger than the males. The degree of size dimorphism varies across multiple populations and species, and is measured through various traits, such as wing span and body mass.\nOne theory suggests that selection has led males to be smaller because it allows them to be efficient foragers. The ability to obtain more food is advantageous during breeding season. In some species, female owls stay at their nest with their eggs while it is the responsibility of the male to bring back food to the nest. If food is scarce, the male first feeds himself before feeding the female. Small birds, which are agile, are an important source of food for owls. Male burrowing owls have been observed to have longer wing chords than females, despite being smaller than females. Furthermore, owls have been observed to be roughly the same size as their prey. This has also been observed in other predatory birds, which suggests that owls with smaller bodies and long wing chords have been selected for because of the increased agility and speed that allows them to catch their prey.\nAnother popular theory suggests that females have not been selected to be smaller like male owls because of their sexual roles. In many species, female owls may not leave the nest. Therefore, females may have a larger mass to allow them to go for a longer period of time without starving. For example, one hypothesized sexual role is that larger females are more capable of dismembering prey and feeding it to their young, hence female owls are larger than their male counterparts.\nA different theory suggests that the size difference between male and females is due to sexual selection: since large females can choose their mate and may violently reject a male's sexual advances, smaller male owls that have the ability to escape unreceptive females are more likely to have been selected.\nIf the character is stable, there can be different optimums for both sexes. Selection operates on both sexes at the same time; therefore it is necessary to explain not only why one of the sexes is relatively bigger, but also why the other sex is smaller. If owls are still evolving toward smaller bodies and longer wing chords, according to V. Geodakyan's Evolutionary Theory of Sex, males should be more advanced on these characters. Males are viewed as an evolutionary vanguard of a population, and sexual dimorphism on the character, as an evolutionary \"distance\" between the sexes. \"Phylogenetic rule of sexual dimorphism\" states that if there exists a sexual dimorphism on any character, then the evolution of this trait goes from the female form toward the male one.\nHunting adaptations.\nAll owls are carnivorous birds of prey and live on diets of insects, small rodents and lagomorphs. Some owls are also specifically adapted to hunt fish. They are very adept in hunting in their respective environments. Since owls can be found in nearly all parts of the world and across a multitude of ecosystems, their hunting skills and characteristics vary slightly from species to species, though most characteristics are shared among all species.\nFlight and feathers.\nMost owls share an innate ability to fly almost silently and also more slowly in comparison to other birds of prey. Most owls live a mainly nocturnal lifestyle and being able to fly without making any noise gives them a strong advantage over prey alert to the slightest sound in the night. A silent, slow flight is not as necessary for diurnal and crepuscular owls given that prey can usually see an owl approaching. Owls' feathers are generally larger than the average birds' feathers, have fewer radiates, longer pennulum, and achieve smooth edges with different rachis structures. Serrated edges along the owl's remiges bring the flapping of the wing down to a nearly silent mechanism. The serrations are more likely reducing aerodynamic disturbances, rather than simply reducing noise. The surface of the flight feathers is covered with a velvety structure that absorbs the sound of the wing moving. These unique structures reduce noise frequencies above 2\u00a0kHz, making the sound level emitted drop below the typical hearing spectrum of the owl's usual prey and also within the owl's own best hearing range. This optimizes the owl's ability to silently fly to capture prey without the prey hearing the owl first as it flies, and to hear any noise the prey makes. It also allows the owl to monitor the sound output from its flight pattern.\nThe disadvantage of such feather adaptations for barn owls is that their feathers are not waterproof. The adaptations mean that barn owls do not use the uropygial gland, informally the \"preen\" or \"oil\" gland, as most birds do, to spread oils across their plumage through preening. This makes them highly vulnerable to heavy rain when they are unable to hunt. Historically, they would switch to hunting indoors in wet weather, using barns and other agricultural buildings, but the decline in the numbers of these structures in the 20th and 21st centuries has reduced such opportunities. The lack of waterproofing means that barn owls are also susceptible to drowning, in drinking troughs and other structures with smooth sides. The Barn Owl Trust provides advice on how this can be mitigated, by the installation of floats.\nVision.\nEyesight is a particular characteristic of the owl that aids in nocturnal prey capture. Owls are part of a small group of birds that live nocturnally, but do not use echolocation to guide them in flight in low-light situations. Owls are known for their disproportionally large eyes in comparison to their skulls. An apparent consequence of the evolution of an absolutely large eye in a relatively small skull is that the eye of the owl has become tubular in shape. This shape is found in other so-called nocturnal eyes, such as the eyes of strepsirrhine primates and bathypelagic fishes. Since the eyes are fixed into these sclerotic tubes, they are unable to move the eyes in any direction. Instead of moving their eyes, owls swivel their heads to view their surroundings. Owls' heads are capable of swiveling through an angle of roughly 270\u00b0, easily enabling them to see behind them without relocating the torso. This ability keeps bodily movement at a minimum, thus reduces the amount of sound the owl makes as it waits for its prey. Owls are regarded as having the most frontally placed eyes among all avian groups, which gives them some of the largest binocular fields of vision. Owls are farsighted and cannot focus on objects within a few centimetres of their eyes. These mechanisms are only able to function due to the large-sized retinal image. Thus, the primary nocturnal function in the vision of the owl is due to its large posterior nodal distance; retinal image brightness is only maximized to the owl within secondary neural functions. These attributes of the owl cause its nocturnal eyesight to be far superior to that of its average prey.\nHearing.\nOwls exhibit specialized hearing functions and ear shapes that also aid in hunting. They are noted for asymmetrical ear placements on the skull in some genera. Owls can have either internal or external ears, both of which are asymmetrical. Asymmetry has not been reported to extend to the middle or internal ear of the owl. Asymmetrical ear placement on the skull allows the owl to pinpoint the location of its prey. This is especially true for strictly nocturnal species such as the barn owls \"Tyto\" or Tengmalm's owl. With ears set at different places on its skull, an owl is able to determine the direction from which the sound is coming by the minute difference in time that it takes for the sound waves to penetrate the left and right ears. The owl turns its head until the sound reaches both ears at the same time, at which point it is directly facing the source of the sound. This time difference between ears is about 30 microseconds. Behind the ear openings are modified, dense feathers, densely packed to form a facial ruff, which creates an anterior-facing, concave wall that cups the sound into the ear structure. This facial ruff is poorly defined in some species, and prominent, nearly encircling the face, in other species. The facial disk also acts to direct sound into the ears, and a downward-facing, sharply triangular beak minimizes sound reflection away from the face. The shape of the facial disk is adjustable at will to focus sounds more effectively.\nThe prominences above a great horned owl's head are commonly mistaken as its ears. This is not the case; they are merely feather tufts. The ears are on the sides of the head in the usual location (in two different locations as described above).\nTalons.\nWhile the auditory and visual capabilities of the owl allow it to locate and pursue its prey, the talons and beak of the owl do the final work. The owl kills its prey using these talons to crush the skull and knead the body. The crushing power of an owl's talons varies according to prey size and type, and by the size of the owl. The burrowing owl (\"Athene cunicularia\"), a small, partly insectivorous owl, has a release force of only 5\u00a0N. The larger barn owl (\"Tyto alba\") needs a force of 30\u00a0N to release its prey, and one of the largest owls, the great horned owl (\"Bubo virginianus\"), needs a force over 130\u00a0N to release prey in its talons. An owl's talons, like those of most birds of prey, can seem massive in comparison to the body size outside of flight. The Tasmanian masked owl has some of the proportionally longest talons of any bird of prey; they appear enormous in comparison to the body when fully extended to grasp prey. An owl's claws are sharp and curved. The family Tytonidae has inner and central toes of about equal length, while the family Strigidae has an inner toe that is distinctly shorter than the central one. These different morphologies allow efficiency in capturing prey specific to the different environments they inhabit.\nBeak.\nThe beak of the owl is short, curved, and downward-facing, and typically hooked at the tip for gripping and tearing its prey. Once prey is captured, the scissor motion of the top and lower bill is used to tear the tissue and kill. The sharp lower edge of the upper bill works in coordination with the sharp upper edge of the lower bill to deliver this motion. The downward-facing beak allows the owl's field of vision to be clear, as well as directing sound into the ears without deflecting sound waves away from the face.\nCamouflage.\nThe coloration of the owl's plumage plays a key role in its ability to sit still and blend into the environment, making it nearly invisible to prey. Owls tend to mimic the coloration and sometimes the texture patterns of their surroundings, the barn owl being an exception. The snowy owl (\"Bubo scandiacus\") appears nearly bleach-white in color with a few flecks of black, mimicking their snowy surroundings perfectly, while the speckled brown plumage of the tawny owl (\"Strix aluco\") allows it to lie in wait among the deciduous woodland it prefers for its habitat. Likewise, the mottled wood owl (\"Strix ocellata\") displays shades of brown, tan, and black, making the owl nearly invisible in the surrounding trees, especially from behind. Usually, the only tell-tale sign of a perched owl is its vocalizations or its vividly colored eyes.\nBehavior.\n \nMost owls are nocturnal, actively hunting their prey in darkness. Several types of owls are crepuscular\u2014active during the twilight hours of dawn and dusk; for example the pygmy owls (\"Glaucidium\"). A few owls are active during the day, also; examples are the burrowing owl (\"Speotyto cunicularia\") and the short-eared owl (\"Asio flammeus\").\nMuch of the owls' hunting strategy depends on stealth and surprise. Owls have at least two adaptations that aid them in achieving stealth. First, the dull coloration of their feathers can render them almost invisible under certain conditions. Secondly, serrated edges on the leading edge of owls' remiges muffle an owl's wing beats, allowing an owl's flight to be practically silent. Some fish-eating owls, for which silence has no evolutionary advantage, lack this adaptation.\nAn owl's sharp beak and powerful talons allow it to kill its prey before swallowing it whole (if it is not too big). Scientists studying the diets of owls are helped by their habit of regurgitating the indigestible parts of their prey (such as bones, scales, and fur) in the form of pellets. These \"owl pellets\" are plentiful and easy to interpret, and are often sold by companies to schools for dissection by students as a lesson in biology and ecology.\nBreeding and reproduction.\nOwl eggs typically have a white color and an almost spherical shape, and range in number from a few to a dozen, depending on species and the particular season; for most, three or four is the more common number. In at least one species, female owls do not mate with the same male for a lifetime. Female burrowing owls commonly travel and find other mates, while the male stays in his territory and mates with other females.\nEvolution and systematics.\nRecent phylogenetic studies place owls within the clade Telluraves, most closely related to the Accipitrimorphae and the Coraciimorphae, although the exact placement within Telluraves is disputed.\nSee below cladogram:\nCladogram of Telluraves relationships based on Braun &amp; Kimball (2021)\nSome 220 to 225 extant species of owls are known, subdivided into two families: 1. true owls or typical owls family (Strigidae) and 2. barn-owls family (Tytonidae). Some entirely extinct families have also been erected based on fossil remains; these differ much from modern owls in being less specialized or specialized in a very different way (such as the terrestrial Sophiornithidae). The Paleocene genera \"Berruornis\" and \"Ogygoptynx\" show that owls were already present as a distinct lineage some 60\u201357 million years ago (Mya), hence, possibly also some 5 million years earlier, at the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs. This makes them one of the oldest known groups of non-Galloanserae landbirds. The supposed \"Cretaceous owls\" \"Bradycneme\" and \"Heptasteornis\" are apparently non-avialan maniraptors.\nDuring the Paleogene, the Strigiformes radiated into ecological niches now mostly filled by other groups of birds. The owls as known today, though, evolved their characteristic morphology and adaptations during that time, too. By the early Neogene, the other lineages had been displaced by other bird orders, leaving only barn owls and typical owls. The latter at that time was usually a fairly generic type of (probably earless) owl similar to today's North American spotted owl or the European tawny owl; the diversity in size and ecology found in typical owls today developed only subsequently.\nAround the Paleogene-Neogene boundary (some 25 Mya), barn owls were the dominant group of owls in southern Europe and adjacent Asia at least; the distribution of fossil and present-day owl lineages indicates that their decline is contemporary with the evolution of the different major lineages of true owls, which for the most part seems to have taken place in Eurasia. In the Americas, rather, an expansion of immigrant lineages of ancestral typical owls occurred.\nThe supposed fossil herons \"\"Ardea\" perplexa\" (Middle Miocene of Sansan, France) and \"\"Ardea\" lignitum\" (Late Pliocene of Germany) were more probably owls; the latter was apparently close to the modern genus \"Bubo\". Judging from this, the Late Miocene remains from France described as \"\"Ardea\" aureliensis\" should also be restudied. The Messelasturidae, some of which were initially believed to be basal Strigiformes, are now generally accepted to be diurnal birds of prey showing some convergent evolution toward owls. The taxa often united under \"Strigogyps\" were formerly placed in part with the owls, specifically the Sophiornithidae; they appear to be Ameghinornithidae instead.\nFor fossil species and paleosubspecies of extant taxa, see the genus and species articles. For a full list of extant and recently extinct owls, see the article List of owl species.\nUnresolved and basal forms (all fossil)\nTytonidae.\nFossil genera\nPlacement unresolved\nStrigidae.\nExtinct genera\nFossil genera\nPlacement unresolved\nSymbolism and mythology.\nAfrica.\nAmong the Kikuyu of Kenya, it was believed that owls were harbingers of death. If one saw an owl or heard its hoot, someone was going to die. In general, owls are viewed as harbingers of bad luck, ill health, or death. The belief is widespread even today.\nSouth Asia.\nIn Hinduism, an owl is the \"vahana\" (mount) of the goddess Lakshmi, especially in the eastern region of India. Owls are considered a symbol of wealth, prosperity, wisdom, good luck, and fortune. This is the reason why Owls are seen with Lakshmi, who is also the goddess of fortune, wealth, and prosperity. At the same time, owls are also associated with evil times in Hinduism. At times, Chamunda (fearsome form of Chandi) is depicted seated on an owl, her vahana (mount or vehicle). Hindus believe that owls are messengers of death.\nEast Asia.\nChina.\nIn China, owls are traditionally considered a sign of evil or misfortune, but are also seen as a symbol of good luck in military affairs, a symbol of protection and warding off evil spirits at funerals, and even as the incarnation of ancestors. Owls are one of the most common birds in carvings and paintings on bronze, pottery, and funerary objects.\nJapan.\nIn Japan, owls are regarded as lucky, although in ancient times they were associated with death.\nMesopotamia.\nIn Sumerian, Akkadian, and Babylonian culture, the owl was associated with Lilith.\nEurope.\nThe modern West generally associates owls with wisdom and vigilance. This link goes back at least as far as Ancient Greece, where Athens, noted for art and scholarship, and Athena, Athens' patron goddess and the goddess of wisdom, had the owl as a symbol. Marija Gimbutas traces veneration of the owl as a goddess, among other birds, to the culture of Old Europe, long pre-dating Indo-European cultures.\nIn medieval Europe, the owl was often used with more negative symbolism. The bird was associated with darkness, uncleanliness, and mourning. The bird was linked to the bubonic plague. Owls were even used as anti-Semitic caricatures of Jews.\nT. F. Thiselton-Dyer, in his 1883 \"Folk-lore of Shakespeare\", says that from the earliest period it has been considered a bird of ill-omen,\" and Pliny tells us how, on one occasion, even Rome itself underwent a lustration, because one of them strayed into the Capitol. He represents it also as a funereal bird, a monster of the night, the very abomination of humankind. Virgil describes its death howl from the top of the temple by night, a circumstance introduced as a precursor of Dido's death. Ovid, too, constantly speaks of this bird's presence as an evil omen; and indeed the same notions respecting it may be found among the writings of most of the ancient poets.\nNative American cultures.\nPeople often allude to the reputation of owls as bearers of supernatural danger when they tell misbehaving children, \"the owls will get you\", and in most Native American folklore, owls are a symbol of death.\nAccording to the Apache and Seminole tribes, hearing owls hooting is considered the subject of numerous \"bogeyman\" stories told to warn children to remain indoors at night or not to cry too much, otherwise the owl may carry them away. In some tribal legends, owls are associated with spirits of the dead, and the bony circles around an owl's eyes are said to comprise the fingernails of apparitional humans. Sometimes owls are said to carry messages from beyond the grave or deliver supernatural warnings to people who have broken tribal taboos.\nThe Aztecs and the Maya, along with other natives of Mesoamerica, considered the owl a symbol of death and destruction. In fact, the Aztec god of death, Mictlantecuhtli, was often depicted with owls. There is an old saying in Mexico that is still in use: \"Cuando el tecolote canta, el indio muere\" (\"When the owl cries/sings, the Indian dies\"). The \"Popol Vuh\", a Mayan religious text, describes owls as messengers of Xibalba (the Mayan \"Place of Fright\").\nThe belief that owls are messengers and harbingers of the dark powers is also found among the Ho\u010d\u0105gara (Winnebago) of Wisconsin. When in earlier days the Ho\u010d\u0105gara committed the sin of killing enemies while they were within the sanctuary of the chief's lodge, an owl appeared and spoke to them in the voice of a human, saying, \"From now on, the Ho\u010d\u0105gara will have no luck.\" This marked the beginning of the decline of their tribe. An owl appeared to Glory of the Morning, the only female chief of the Ho\u010d\u0105k nation, and uttered her name. Soon after, she died.\nAccording to the culture of the Hopi, a Uto-Aztec tribe, taboos surround owls, which are associated with sorcery and other evils.\nThe Ojibwe tribes, as well as their Aboriginal Canadian counterparts, used an owl as a symbol for both evil and death. In addition, they used owls as a symbol of very high status of spiritual leaders of their spirituality.\nThe Pawnee tribes viewed owls as the symbol of protection from any danger within their realms.\nThe Puebloan peoples associated owls with Skeleton Man, the god of death and the spirit of fertility.\nThe Yakama tribes use an owl as a totem, to guide where and how forests and natural resources are useful with management.\nRodent control.\nEncouraging natural predators to control rodent population is a natural form of pest control, along with excluding food sources for rodents. Placing a nest box for owls on a property can help control rodent populations (one family of hungry barn owls can consume more than 3,000 rodents in a nesting season) while maintaining the naturally balanced food chain.\nConservation issues.\nAlmost all owls are listed in Appendix II of the international CITES treaty (the Convention on Illegal Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) with four species listed in Appendix I. Although owls have long been hunted, a 2008 news story from Malaysia indicates that the magnitude of owl poaching may be on the rise. In November 2008, TRAFFIC reported the seizure of 900 plucked and \"oven-ready\" owls in Peninsular Malaysia. Said Chris Shepherd, Senior Programme Officer for TRAFFIC's Southeast Asia office, \"This is the first time we know of where 'ready-prepared' owls have been seized in Malaysia, and it may mark the start of a new trend in wild meat from the region. We will be monitoring developments closely.\" TRAFFIC commended the Department of Wildlife and National Parks in Malaysia for the raid that exposed the huge haul of owls. Included in the seizure were dead and plucked barn owls, spotted wood owls, crested serpent eagles, barred eagles, and brown wood owls, as well as 7,000 live lizards.\nIn addition to hunting, other threats to owl populations are habitat loss, pesticides, viruses, and vehicle collisions.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nEurasia:\nNorth America:\nOceania:"}
{"id": "37656", "revid": "1126265", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37656", "title": "Concurrent Versions System", "text": "Historical centralized version control system\nConcurrent Versions System (CVS, or Concurrent Versioning System) is a version control system originally developed by Dick Grune in July 1986. It builds on top of an older version control system called Revision Control System (RCS), adding support for repository-level change tracking, and a client-server model. CVS servers normally run on Unix systems, while clients can be on any operating system.\nDesign.\nCVS operates as a front end to Revision Control System (RCS), an older version control system that manages individual files but not whole projects. It expands upon RCS by adding support for repository-level change tracking, and a client-server model. Files are tracked using the same history format as in RCS, with a hidden directory containing a corresponding history file for each file in the repository.\nCVS uses delta compression for efficient storage of different versions of the same file. This works well with large text files with few changes from one version to the next. This is usually the case for source code files. On the other hand, when CVS is told to store a file as binary, it will keep each individual version on the server. This is typically used for non-text files such as executable images where it is difficult to create compact deltas between versions.\nCVS excludes symbolic links because when they are stored in a version control system they can pose a security risk. For instance, a symbolic link to a sensitive file can be stored in the repository, making the sensitive file accessible even when it is not checked in. In place of symbolic links, scripts that require certain privileges and conscious intervention to execute may be checked into CVS.\nOperation.\nCVS labels a single project (set of related files) that it manages as a \"module\". A CVS server stores the modules it manages in its \"repository\". Programmers acquire copies of modules by \"checking out\". The checked-out files serve as a \"working copy\", \"sandbox\" or \"workspace\". Changes to the working copy are reflected in the repository by \"committing\" them. To \"update\" is to acquire or \"merge\" the changes in the repository with the working copy.\nCVS uses a client\u2013server architecture: a server stores the current version(s) of a project and its history, and clients connect to the server in order to \"check out\" a complete copy of the project, work on this copy and then later \"check in\" their changes. CVS servers can allow \"anonymous read access\", wherein clients may check out and compare versions with either a blank or simple published password (e.g., \"anoncvs\"); only the check-in of changes requires a personal account and password in these scenarios. Several developers may work on the same project concurrently, each one editing files within their own \"working copy\" of the project, and sending (or \"checking in\") their modifications to the server. To avoid conflicts, the server only accepts changes made to the most recent version of a file. Developers are therefore expected to keep their working copy up-to-date by incorporating other people's changes on a regular basis. This task is mostly handled automatically by the CVS client, requiring manual intervention only when an edit conflict arises between a checked-in modification and the yet-unchecked local version of a file. Clients can also use the \"update\" command to bring their local copies up-to-date with the newest version on the server. Clients can also compare versions, request a complete history of changes, or check out a historical snapshot of the project (e.g., based on a given date). If the check-in operation succeeds, then the version numbers of all files involved automatically increment, and the server writes a user-supplied description line, the date and the author's name to its log files. CVS can also run external, user-specified log processing scripts following each commit. These scripts are installed by an entry in CVS's codice_1 file, which can trigger email notification or convert the log data into a Web-based format.\nCVS can also maintain different \"branches\" of a project. For instance, a released version of the software project may form one branch, used for bug fixes, while a version under current development, with major changes and new features, can form a separate branch. CVS assumes that the majority of work takes place on the trunk, and that branches should generally be short-lived or historical. When used as designed, branches are easily managed and branch operations are efficient and fast.\nPortability.\nThe developers of the server software write it for Unix, although CVSNT server also supports various versions of Microsoft Windows), while CVS clients may run on any major operating system platform.\nHistory.\nGrune recalled:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; I created CVS to be able to cooperate with my students, Erik Baalbergen and Maarten Waage, on the ACK (Amsterdam Compiler Kit) C compiler. The three of us had vastly different schedules (one student was a steady 9-5 worker, the other was irregular, and I could work on the project only in the evenings). Their project ran from July 1984 to August 1985. CVS was initially called cmt, for the obvious reason that it allowed us to commit versions independently.\nGrune publicly released the code on June 23, 1986.\nThe code that eventually evolved into the current version of CVS started with Brian Berliner in April 1989, with later input from Jeff Polk and many other contributors. Brian Berliner wrote a paper introducing his improvements to the CVS program\u2014which describes how the tool was extended and used internally by Prisma, a third-party developer working on the SunOS kernel, and was released for the benefit of the community under the GPL. On November 19, 1990, CVS version 1.0 was submitted to the Free Software Foundation for development and distribution.\nThe latest version was released on 8 May 2008.\nAdoption and successors.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In the world of open source software, the Concurrent Version System (CVS) has long been the tool of choice for version control. And rightly so. CVS itself is free software, and its non-restrictive \"modus operandi\" and support for networked operation\u2014which allow dozens of geographically dispersed programmers to share their work\u2014fits the collaborative nature of the open-source world very well. CVS and its semi-chaotic development model have become cornerstones of open-source.\nOver time, developers have created new version control systems based on CVS in order to add features, alter the operational model, and improve developers' productivity. CVS replacement projects include CVSNT and Subversion.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "37661", "revid": "50941265", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37661", "title": "Alfred Kinsey", "text": "American scientist (1894\u20131956)\nAlfred Charles Kinsey (; June 23, 1894 \u2013 August 25, 1956) was an American sexologist, biologist, and professor of entomology and zoology who, in 1947, founded the Institute for Sex Research at Indiana University, now known as the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction. He is best known for writing \"Sexual Behavior in the Human Male\" (1948) and \"Sexual Behavior in the Human Female\" (1953), also known as the Kinsey Reports, as well as for the Kinsey scale. Kinsey's research on human sexuality, foundational to the field of sexology, provoked controversy in the 1940s and 1950s, and has continued to provoke controversy decades after his death. His work has influenced social and cultural values in the United States and United Kingdom as well as internationally.\nEarly life and education.\nAlfred Kinsey was born on June 23, 1894, in Hoboken, New Jersey, the son of Sarah Ann (n\u00e9e Charles) and Alfred Seguine Kinsey. He was the eldest of three children. His mother received little formal education; his father was a professor at Stevens Institute of Technology.\nKinsey's parents were devout Christians. His father was known as one of the most devout members of the local Methodist church. Most of Kinsey's social interactions were with other members of the church, often as a silent observer, while his parents discussed religion. Kinsey's father imposed strict rules on the household, including mandating Sunday as a day of prayer and little else.\nKinsey's parents were poor for most of his childhood, often unable to afford proper medical care. This may have led to a young Kinsey receiving inadequate treatment for a variety of diseases including rickets, rheumatic fever, and typhoid fever. His health records indicate that Kinsey received suboptimal exposure to sunlight (often the cause of rickets, before milk and other foods were fortified with vitamin D) and lived in unsanitary conditions for at least part of his childhood. Rickets led to a curvature of the spine, which resulted in a slight stoop that prevented Kinsey from being drafted in 1917 for World War I.\nAt age 10, Kinsey moved with his family to South Orange, New Jersey. Also at a young age, he showed great interest in nature and camping. He worked and camped with the local YMCA throughout his early years, and enjoyed these activities to such an extent that he intended to work for the YMCA after completing his education. Kinsey's senior undergraduate thesis for psychology, a dissertation on the group dynamics of young boys, echoed this interest. He joined the Boy Scouts when a troop was formed in his community. His parents strongly supported this (and joined as well) because the Boy Scouts was an organization that was based on the principles of Christianity. Kinsey worked his way up through the Scouting ranks to earn Eagle Scout in 1913, making him one of the earliest Eagle Scouts. Despite earlier disease having weakened his heart, Kinsey followed an intense sequence of difficult hikes and camping expeditions throughout his early life.\nIn high school, Kinsey was a quiet but hard-working student. While attending Columbia High School, he devoted his energy to academic work and playing the piano. At one time, Kinsey had hoped to become a concert pianist, but decided to concentrate on his scientific pursuits instead. Kinsey's ability to spend immense amounts of time deeply focused on study was a trait that would serve him well in college and during his professional career. He seems not to have formed strong social relationships during high school, but earned respect for his academic ability. While there, Kinsey became interested in biology, botany and zoology. Kinsey was later to claim that his high school biology teacher, Natalie Roeth, was the most important influence on his decision to become a scientist.\nKinsey approached his father with plans to study botany at college. His father demanded that he study engineering at Stevens Institute of Technology instead. At Stevens, he primarily took courses related to English and engineering, but was unable to satisfy his interest in biology. Kinsey was not successful there, and decided engineering was not a field at which he could excel. At the end of two years at Stevens, Kinsey gathered the courage to confront his father about his interest in biology and his intent to continue studying at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, where he majored in biology.\nInitial research on entomology.\nIn the fall of 1914, Kinsey entered Bowdoin College, where he studied entomology under Manton Copeland, and was admitted to the Zeta Psi fraternity, in whose house he lived for much of his time at college. In 1916 Kinsey was elected to the Phi Beta Kappa society and graduated magna cum laude, with degrees in biology and psychology. Alfred Seguine Kinsey did not attend his son's graduation ceremony at Bowdoin, possibly as another sign of disapproval of his son's choice of career and studies.\nKinsey continued his graduate studies at Harvard University's Bussey Institute, which had one of the most highly regarded biology programs in the United States. It was there that Kinsey studied applied biology under William Morton Wheeler, a scientist who made outstanding contributions to entomology. Under Wheeler, Kinsey worked almost completely autonomously, which suited both men quite well.\nKinsey wrote his doctoral thesis on gall wasps, zealously collecting samples of the species. He traveled widely and took 26 detailed measurements of hundreds of thousands of gall wasps; his methodology was itself an important contribution to entomology as a science. In 1919, Kinsey was awarded an Sc.D from Harvard University, and he accepted an academic post in biology at Indiana University. In 1920 he published several papers under the auspices of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, introducing the gall wasp to the scientific community and describing its phylogeny. Of the more than 18\u00a0million insects in the museum's collection, some 5\u00a0million are gall wasps collected by Kinsey.\nKinsey wrote a widely used high-school textbook, \"An Introduction to Biology\", which was published in October 1926. The book endorsed evolution and unified, at the introductory level, the previously separate fields of zoology and botany.\n &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"An Introduction to Biology\" was unlike any other textbook on the market\u00a0... Kinsey's textbook was noteworthy for the strong position it took on evolution\u00a0... In his textbook Kinsey laid out the basic facts of evolution in a manner-of-fact matter, as though he were discussing the life cycle of the fruit fly.\u00a0... The chapter called \"Further Evidence of Change\" was especially blunt\u00a0... Kinsey defined evolution as \"the scientific word for change\", and while he acknowledged that there are some people who \"think they don't believe in evolution\", he tried to show his students the folly of such reasoning. To find proof of evolution, students had only to look at things they used daily\u00a0... Kinsey ridiculed the man who denounced evolution but owned a new breed of dog or smoked a cigar made from a recently improved variety of tobacco, saying, \"When he says he doesn't believe in evolution, I wonder what he means.\"\nKinsey co-authored \"Edible Wild Plants of Eastern North America\", published in 1943, with Merritt Lyndon Fernald. The original draft of the book was written in 1919\u20131920, while Kinsey was still a doctoral student at the Bussey Institute, and Fernald was working at the Arnold Arboretum.\nSexology.\nThe Kinsey Reports.\nKinsey is widely regarded as the first major figure in American sexology; his research helped pave the way for a deeper exploration into sexuality among sexologists and the general public, as well as liberating female sexuality. For example, Kinsey's work disputed the notions that women generally are not sexual and that female orgasms experienced vaginally are superior to clitoral orgasms. He initially became interested in different forms of sexual practices in 1933, after discussing the topic extensively with a colleague, Robert Kroc. Kinsey had been studying the variations in mating practices among gall wasps. During this time, he developed a scale measuring sexual orientation, now known as the Kinsey scale, which ranges from 0 to 6, where 0 is exclusively heterosexual and 6 is exclusively homosexual; a rating of X for \"no socio-sexual contacts or reactions\" was later added.\nIn 1935, Kinsey delivered a lecture to a faculty discussion group at Indiana University, his first public discussion of the topic, wherein he attacked the \"widespread ignorance of sexual structure and physiology\" and promoted his view that \"delayed marriage\" (that is, delayed sexual experience) was psychologically harmful. Kinsey obtained research funding from the Rockefeller Foundation, which enabled him to further study human sexual behavior. He published \"Sexual Behavior in the Human Male\" in 1948, followed in 1953 by \"Sexual Behavior in the Human Female\", both of which reached the top of the bestseller lists and turned Kinsey into a celebrity. These publications later became known as the Kinsey Reports. Articles about him appeared in magazines such as \"Time\", \"Life\", \"Look\", and \"McCall's\". The Kinsey Reports, which led to a storm of controversy, are regarded by many as a precursor to the sexual revolution of the 1960s and 1970s.\nControversies.\nKinsey's research went beyond theory and interview to include observation of and participation in sexual activity, sometimes involving co-workers. Kinsey justified this sexual experimentation as being necessary to gain the confidence of his research subjects. He encouraged his staff to do likewise, and to engage in a wide range of sexual activity, to the extent that they felt comfortable; he argued that this would help his interviewers understand the participants' responses. Kinsey filmed sexual acts which included co-workers in the attic of his home as part of his research; Biographer Jonathan Gathorne-Hardy explains that this was done to ensure the films' secrecy, which would have caused a scandal had it become public knowledge. James H. Jones, author of \"Alfred C. Kinsey: A Public/Private Life\", and British psychiatrist Anthony Malcolm Daniels aka Theodore Dalrymple, among others, have speculated that Kinsey was driven by his own sexual needs.\nSome of the data published in the two \"Kinsey Reports\" books is controversial in the scientific and psychiatric communities, owing to Kinsey's decision to interview volunteers who may not have been representative of the general population. University of Chicago sociology professor Edward Laumann also argued that Kinsey's work was focused on the biology of sex and lacked psychological and clinical information and analysis.\nKinsey collected sexual material from around the world, which brought him to the attention of the U.S. Customs Service when they seized some pornographic films in 1956; he died before this matter was resolved legally. Kinsey wrote about pre-adolescent orgasms using data in tables 30 to 34 of the male volume, which report observations of orgasms in over 300 children aged from two months up to fifteen years. This information was said to have come from adults' childhood memories, or from parent or teacher observation. Kinsey said he also interviewed nine men who had sexual experiences with children and who told him about the children's responses and reactions. Little attention was paid to this part of Kinsey's research at the time, but where Kinsey had gained this information began to be questioned nearly 40 years later. It was later revealed that Kinsey used data from a single pedophile and presented it as being from various sources. Kinsey knew the abuse would continue but had seen the need for participant confidentiality and anonymity as necessary to gain \"honest answers on such taboo subjects\". Years later, the Kinsey Institute said that the data on children in tables 31\u201334 came from one man's journal (started in 1917) and that the events concerned predated the Kinsey Reports.\nThese allegations have been revived by a political fight inside the Indiana State Senate, but the opposition complained that \"These are warmed over Internet memes that keep coming back.\" IndyStar remarked \"They cited long-held but largely debunked allegations about the work of Alfred Kinsey...\".\nJones wrote that Kinsey's sexual activity influenced his work, that he over-represented prisoners and prostitutes, classified some single people as \"married\", and that he included a disproportionate number of homosexual men, which may have distorted his studies. While he has been criticized for omitting African-Americans from his research, his report on the human male includes numerous references to African-American participants. Historian Vern Bullough writes that the data was later reinterpreted, excluding prisoners and data derived from an exclusively gay sample, and the results indicate that it does not appear to have skewed the data. Kinsey may have over-represented homosexuals, but Bullough considers that this may have been because homosexual behavior was stigmatized and needed to be better understood. Paul Gebhard, who was Kinsey's colleague from 1946 to 1956 and who also succeeded Kinsey as Director of the Kinsey Institute following his death, attempted to justify Kinsey's work in the 1970s by removing some of the suspect data where Kinsey allegedly showed a bias towards homosexuality. After Gebhard recalculated the findings in Kinsey's work, he found only slight differences between the original and updated figures.\nBailey et al., in their 2016 review of the sexual orientation literature, stated that Kinsey's survey likely overestimated the frequencies of nonheterosexual attractions and expressions, because his statistics show a higher percentage of the American population as homosexual or bisexual than more modern studies do. However Kinsey biographer Jonathan Gathorne-Hardy states that Kinsey's interview style was quite different from the methodologies of modern studies, something he attributes as a reason for difference of answers. Kinsey focused on in-depth interviews with subjects carried out by himself or highly trained members of his team, and emphasized creating rapport with the interviewee and making them feel comfortable and secure. Modern interviewers tend to be less thoroughly trained and emphasize scientific detachment, which may make respondents less likely to share sensitive personal details.\nThe postmodern take on Kinsey is that sexuality should not be made an object of science. I.e. postmodernism heavily rejects a study of sexuality based upon naturalistic assumptions.\nPersonal life.\nKinsey was raised as a Methodist, and for a time converted to a much less fundamentalist Congregationalism. During his studies at Harvard he apparently became agnostic or atheist, replacing religious fervor with fervor for science. He married Clara McMillen in 1921. Their marriage ceremony, like his college graduation, was avoided by Alfred Sr. The couple had four children. Their first son, Donald, born in 1922, died from the acute complications of juvenile diabetes in 1927, just before his fifth birthday. Their first daughter, Anne, was born in 1924, followed by Joan in 1925, and then by their second son Bruce in 1928.\nKinsey was bisexual, and one biographer believes that as a young man he would punish himself for having homoerotic feelings. He and his wife agreed that both could have sex with other people as well as with each other. Kinsey had sex with other men, including his student Clyde Martin.\nKinsey was a friend of the occult filmmaker Kenneth Anger. In 1955, both visited the Abbey of Thelema in Cefal\u00f9, Sicily, where Aleister Crowley (in which both were interested) had established a commune.\nKinsey designed his own house, which was built in the Vinegar Hill neighborhood of Bloomington, Indiana, at 1320 First Street. There he practiced his deep interest in gardening.\nKinsey died on August 25, 1956, at the age of 62. The cause of his death was reported to be a heart ailment and pneumonia. The \"New York Times\" ran the following editorial on August 27, 1956:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nKinsey was buried at Rose Hill Cemetery in Bloomington, Indiana.\nLegacy.\nThe popularity of \"Sexual Behavior in the Human Male\" prompted widespread media interest in 1948. \"Time\" magazine declared, \"Not since \"Gone With the Wind\" had booksellers seen anything like it.\" The first pop culture references to Kinsey appeared not long after the book's publication; \"Martha Raye [sold] a half-million copies of 'Ooh, Dr. Kinsey!'\" Cole Porter's song \"Too Darn Hot\", from the Tony Award-winning Broadway musical \"Kiss Me, Kate\", devoted its bridge to \"the Kinsey report / Every average man you know / Much prefers to play his favorite sport\". In 1949 Mae West, reminiscing on the days when the word \"sex\" was rarely uttered, said of Kinsey, \"That guy merely makes it easy for me. Now I don't have to draw 'em any blueprints\u00a0... We are both in the same business\u00a0... Except I saw it first.\"\nThe publication of \"Sexual Behavior in the Human Female\" prompted even more intensive news coverage. Kinsey appeared on the cover of the August 24, 1953, issue of \"Time\". The national news magazine featured two articles on the scientist, one focusing on his research, career and new book, the other on his background, personality, and lifestyle. In the magazine's cover portrait, \"Flowers, birds, and a bee surround Kinsey; the mirror-of-Venus female symbol decorates his bow tie.\" The lead article concluded: \"'Kinsey\u00a0... has done for sex what Columbus did for geography,' declared a pair of enthusiasts\u00a0... forgetting that Columbus did not know where he was when he got there.\u00a0... Kinsey's work contains much that is valuable, but it must not be mistaken for the last word.\" A character called \"Dr. Kinsey\" appeared on the September 15, 1953, television episode of \"The Jack Benny Program\" as a bow-tied man interviewing a young woman on board a cruise ship that has left Hawaii. When \"Dr. Kinsey\" identifies himself to Jack Benny, Benny steps away in embarrassment. The \"Dr. Kinsey\" character was also written into another sketch in the same episode, commenting on a fantasy Benny is having about Marilyn Monroe (a guest on the episode).\nThe early 2000s saw a renewed interest in Kinsey. In 2003 Theatre of NOTE produced the Steve Morgan Haskell play titled \"Fucking Wasps\" which followed Kinsey's life from childhood until death. Matt Sesow's paintings adorned the theater along with David Bickford playing piano live. Written and directed by Steve Morgan Haskell, \"Fucking Wasps\" received many accolades, including a Playwriting of the Year nomination from Backstage West. Premiering in 2003, the musical \"Dr. Sex\" focuses on the relationship between Kinsey, his wife, and their shared lover Wally Matthews (based on Clyde Martin). The play had a score by Larry Bortniker, a book by Bortniker and Sally Deering, and won seven Jeff Awards. It was produced off-Broadway in 2005. The 2004 biographical film \"Kinsey\", written and directed by Bill Condon, stars Liam Neeson as the scientist and Laura Linney as his wife. In 2004 T. Coraghessan Boyle's novel about Kinsey, \"The Inner Circle\", was published. The following year, PBS produced the documentary \"Kinsey\" in cooperation with the Kinsey Institute, which allowed access to many of its files. \"Mr. Sex\", a BBC radio play by Steve Coombes concerning Kinsey and his work, won the 2005 Imison Award.\nIn 2012, Kinsey was inducted into the Legacy Walk in Chicago, an outdoor public display which celebrates LGBT history and people.\nIn June 2019, Kinsey was one of the inaugural fifty American \"pioneers, trailblazers, and heroes\" inducted on the National LGBTQ Wall of Honor within the Stonewall National Monument (SNM) in New York City's Stonewall Inn. The SNM is the first U.S. national monument dedicated to LGBTQ rights and history, and the wall's unveiling was timed to take place during the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

One of the popes of the Byzantine Papacy, he is described by a contemporary biographer as both just and learned. He is commemorated as a saint in the Roman Martyrology.\nEarly career.\nLeo was a Sicilian by birth, the son of a man named Paul. He may have ended up being among the many Sicilian clergymen in Rome due to the attacks of the Caliphate on Sicily in the mid-7th century. Leo was known as an eloquent preacher who was interested in music, and noted for his charity to the poor.\nPapacy.\nPope Agatho died on 10 January 681, and Leo was elected on 16 April. He was not consecrated until 17 August 682. The reason may have been due to Agatho's negotiations with Emperor Constantine IV regarding imperial control of papal elections. Constantine IV had already promised Agatho to abolish or reduce the tax that the Popes had been paying to the imperial treasury at the time of their consecration, an imperial policy that had been in force for about a century.\nLeo's short-lived pontificate did not allow him to accomplish much. Notably, he confirmed the acts of the Sixth Ecumenical Council (680\u2013681) against Monothelitism. After Leo had notified the emperor that the decrees of the council had been confirmed, he made them known to the people of the West. In letters written to the Visigothic king, bishops, and nobles, he explained what the council had effected, and he called upon the bishops to subscribe to its decrees. During this council, Pope Honorius I was anathematized for tolerating Monothelism. Leo took great pains to make it clear that in condemning Honorius, he did so not because Honorius taught heresy, but because he was not active enough in opposing it. In accordance with the papal mandate, a synod was held at Toledo (684) in which the Third Council of Constantinople was accepted.\nLeo put an end to the attempts of Archbishops of Ravenna to break from the control of the Bishop of Rome, but also abolished the tax it had been customary for them to pay when they received the pallium. In apparent response to Lombard raids, Leo transferred the relics of some martyrs from the catacombs to churches inside the city walls. He dedicated two churches, St. Paul's and Sts. Sebastian and George. Leo also reformed Gregorian Chant and composed several sacred hymns for the Divine Office.\nDeath.\nLeo died on 28 June 683, and was succeeded by Benedict II. He was originally buried in his own monument; however, some years after his death, his remains were put into a tomb that contained the first four of his papal namesakes.\nReferences.\n "}

He is remembered for repairing Roman churches that had been damaged during the Arab raid against Rome, and for building the Leonine Wall around Vatican Hill to protect the city. Pope Leo organized a league of Italian cities who fought and won the sea Battle of Ostia against the Saracens.\nEarly career.\nA Roman by birth, Leo received his early education at Rome in the monastery of St. Martin, near St. Peter's. He attracted the notice of Pope Gregory IV, who made him a subdeacon; and was created cardinal-priest of Santi Quattro Coronati by Pope Sergius II.\nPontificate.\nIn April 847, Leo was unanimously chosen to succeed Sergius II. As the attack of the Saracens on Rome in 846 caused the people to fear for the safety of the city, he was consecrated on 10 April, 847 without waiting for the consent of the emperor.\nSaracen defenses.\nHe immediately began to repair the damage done to various churches of the city during the Arab raid against Rome. He restored and embellished the damaged Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls and St. Peter's Basilica. The latter's altar again received its gold covering (after being stolen), which weighed 206 pounds (93.4 kilograms) and was studded with precious gems. Following the restoration of St. Peter's, Leo appealed to the Christian kingdoms to confront the Arab raiders.\nLeo also took precautions against further raids. He put the walls of the city into a thorough state of repair, entirely rebuilding fifteen of the great towers. He was the first to enclose the Vatican hill by a wall. Leo ordered a new line of walls encompassing the suburb on the right bank of the Tiber to be built, including St. Peter's Basilica, which had been undefended until this time. The district enclosed by the walls is still known as the Leonine City, and corresponds to the later rione of Borgo. To do this, he received money from the emperor, and help from all the cities and agricultural colonies (\"domus cultae\") of the Duchy of Rome. The work took him four years to accomplish.\nBattle of Ostia.\nIn 849, when a Saracen fleet from Sardinia approached Portus, Leo IV summoned the maritime republics \u2013 Naples, Gaeta and Amalfi \u2013 to form a league. The command of the unified fleet was given to Cesarius, son of Duke Sergius I of Naples. Aided by a fierce storm, the league destroyed the Saracen fleet off Ostia. The Battle of Ostia was one of the most famous in history of the Papacy of the Middle Ages and is celebrated in a famous fresco by Raphael and his pupils in his rooms of the Vatican Palace in the Vatican City.\nRaphael's \"The Fire in the Borgo\" celebrates the incident in which, according to legend, Leo stopped a fire in the pilgrims' district by making the sign of the cross.\nLeo IV held three synods, the one in 850 distinguished by the presence of Emperor Louis II, but the other two of little importance. In 853, he travelled to Ravenna to settle a dispute with the archbishop. As the archbishop was on good terms with Emperor Lothair I, the pope had little success. The history of the papal struggle with Hincmar of Reims, which began during Leo's pontificate, belongs properly to that of Nicholas I.\nBefore his death in 855 the Pope welcomed Aethelwulf King of Wessex and his sons, including the seven year old Alfred the Great, who at 5 had already met him in 853, as pilgrims to Rome.\nDeath and burial.\nLeo IV died on 17 July 855 and was succeeded by Benedict III, although a legend says he was succeeded by Pope Joan for two years. Nowadays, the story of Pope Joan is regarded by scholars as fictional.\nLeo IV was originally buried in his own monument in St. Peter's Basilica. Some years after his death, his remains were put into a tomb that contained the first four popes named Leo. In the 18th century, the relics of Leo the Great were separated from his namesakes and given their own chapel.\nIconography.\nLeo IV had the figure of a rooster placed on the Old St. Peter's Basilica or old Constantinian basilica which has served as a religious icon and reminder of Peter's denial of Christ since that time, with some churches still having the cockerel on the steeple today. It is reputed that Pope Gregory I had previously said that the cock (rooster) \"was the most suitable emblem of Christianity\", being \"the emblem of St Peter\". After Leo IV, Pope Nicholas I, who had been made a deacon by Leo IV, decreed that the figure of the cock (rooster) should be placed on every church.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was pope immediately before the period known as the \"Saeculum obscurum\", when popes wielded little temporal authority. His papacy occurred in the second half of 903, with exact months being difficult to discern.\nLeo V was born at a place called Priapi, near Ardea. Although he was a priest when he was elected pope following the death of Pope Benedict IV (900\u2013903), he was not a cardinal priest of Rome.\nDuring his brief pontificate, Leo granted the canons of Bologna a special bull \"(epistola tuitionis)\" where he exempted them from the payment of taxes. However, after a reign of a little over two months, Leo was captured by Christopher, the cardinal-priest of San Lorenzo in Damaso, and thrown into prison. Christopher then had himself elected pope (903\u2013904); until the 19th century he was often considered to have been a legitimate pope. Papal scholar Horace Kinder Mann on the other hand, argued in 1910 that Christopher was likely an antipope. \nLeo died shortly after being deposed. He was either murdered on the orders of Christopher in 903, who was in turn executed by Sergius III (904\u2013911) in 904, or, possibly, both were ordered to be killed at the beginning of Sergius\u2019 pontificate, either on the orders of Sergius himself, or by the direction of Sergius' patron, Theophylact I of Tusculum.

{"id": "37669", "revid": "50654107", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37669", "title": "William Tyndale", "text": "English biblical scholar, translator, and reformer (1494\u20131536)\nWilliam Tyndale (; sometimes spelled \"Tynsdale\", \"Tindall\", \"Tindill\", \"Tyndall\"; c.\u20091494 \u2013 October 1536) was an English Biblical scholar and linguist who became a leading figure in the Protestant Reformation in the years leading up to his execution. He translated much of the Bible into English and was influenced by the works of prominent Protestant Reformers such as Martin Luther.\nTyndale's translations were the first English Scriptures to draw directly from Hebrew and Greek texts, the first English translation to take advantage of the printing press, the first of the new English Bibles of the Reformation, and the first English translation to use \"Jehovah\" (\"Iehouah\") as God's name. It was taken to be a direct challenge to the authority of the Catholic Church and of those laws of England maintaining the Church's position. The work of Tyndale continued to play a key role in spreading Reformation ideas across the English-speaking world.\nIn \"The Obedience of a Christian Man\" (1528) Tyndale argued for Caesaropapism, the idea that the monarch rather than the Pope should control a country's Church. This was the first instance of advocating the divine right of kings in England (sometimes mistakenly attributed to the Catholic Church). The book came into the hands of King Henry VIII, providing a rationale for breaking the Church in England away from the Catholic Church in 1534. In 1530, Tyndale wrote \"The Practice of Prelates\", opposing Henry's plan to seek the annulment of his marriage on the grounds that it contravened Scripture. This work made him enemy of both the State and the Church, therefore he fled England and sought refuge in the Flemish territory of the Catholic Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. In 1535 Tyndale was arrested and jailed in the castle of Vilvoorde (Filford) outside Brussels. The following year he was convicted of heresy and executed by strangulation, after which his body was burnt at the stake.\nTyndale's translations of biblical books were re-used by subsequent English editions (often without his sectarian prefaces or annotations) including the Great Bible and the Bishops' Bible, authorized by the Church of England. In 1611, after seven years of work, the 47 scholars who produced the King James Version of the Bible drew extensively from Tyndale's original work and other translations that descended from his. One estimate suggests that the New Testament in the King James Version is 83% Tyndale's words and the first half of the Old Testament 76%. In 2002, Tyndale was placed 26th in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons.\nBackground.\nTyndale lived and worked during the era of Renaissance humanism and the revival of Biblical scholarship, which were both aided by both the Gutenberg Revolution and the ensuing democratisation of knowledge; for example, the publication of Johann Reuchlin's Hebrew grammar in 1506. Notably, Erasmus compiled, edited, and published the Koine Greek scriptures of the New Testament in 1516. Luther's translation of the Christian Bible into German appeared between 1522 and 1534.\nPartial Old English translations had been made from the 7th century onwards, and by the 14th century contemporary vernacular translations were available in most other major European languages. However the religious foment and violent rebellion of the Lollards resulted in heresy being treated as sedition under English law, which bore the death penalty. Lollardy was associated by authorities with the possession and public readings of Wycliffite Bibles in the newly emerged Middle English; manuscripts with Wycliffite material were destroyed; the possession of Wycliffite material could be used as information in investigations and inquisitions though not used as a proof of heresy.\nBy the early 16th century, the Wycliffite translations were becoming less and less comprehensible as the English language changed from Middle English to Early Modern English. Classical and Koine Greek texts became widely available to the European scholarly community for the first time in centuries, as it welcomed Greek-speaking scholars, philosophers, intellectuals, and the manuscripts they carried to Catholic Europe as refugees following the fall of Constantinople in 1453.\nLife.\nThe Tyndale family also went by the name Hychyns (Hitchins), and it was as William Hychyns that Tyndale was enrolled at Magdalen Hall, Oxford. Tyndale's brother Edward was receiver to the lands of Lord Berkeley, as attested to in a letter by Bishop Stokesley of London. William Tyndale's niece Margaret Tyndale was married to Protestant martyr Rowland Taylor, burnt during the Marian Persecutions.\nTheories about his origins.\nTyndale may have been born around 1494 in Melksham Court, Stinchcombe, a village near Dursley, Gloucestershire. A conjecture is that Tyndale's family had moved to Gloucestershire at some point in the 15th century, probably as a result of the Wars of the Roses. The family may have originated from Northumberland via East Anglia. Tyndale is recorded in two Victorian genealogies which claim he was the brother of Sir William Tyndale of Deane, Northumberland, and Hockwold, Norfolk, who was knighted at the marriage of Arthur, Prince of Wales to Catherine of Aragon. If this is true then Tyndale's family was thus descended from Baron Adam de Tyndale, a tenant-in-chief of Henry I.\nAt Oxford.\nAfter schooling at Katharine Lady Berkeley's School, Wotton-under-Edge in Gloucestershire Tyndale began a Bachelor of Arts degree at Magdalen Hall (later Hertford College) of Oxford University in 1506 and received his B.A. in 1512, the same year becoming a subdeacon. He was made Master of Arts in July 1515 and was held to be a man of virtuous disposition, leading an unblemished life. The M.A. qualified him to start study the advanced doctoral degree of theology, a systematic course of theological study though not a systematic biblical study. As Tyndale later hyperbolized of the curriculum:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;They have ordained that no man shall look on the Scripture until he is modeled in heathen learning eight or nine years and armed with false principles, with which he is clean shut out of the understanding of the Scripture.\nHe was a gifted linguist and became fluent over the years in French, Greek, Hebrew, German, Italian, Latin, and Spanish, in addition to English. Between 1517 and 1521, he went to the University of Cambridge. Erasmus had been the leading teacher of Greek there from August 1511 to January 1512, but not during Tyndale's time at the university.\nTyndale became chaplain at the home of Sir John Walsh at Little Sodbury in Gloucestershire and tutor to his children around 1521. His opinions proved controversial to fellow clergymen, and the next year he was summoned before John Bell, the Chancellor of the Diocese of Worcester, although no formal charges were laid at the time. After the meeting with Bell and other church leaders, Tyndale, according to John Foxe, had an argument with a \"learned but blasphemous clergyman\", who allegedly asserted: \"We had better be without God's laws than the Pope's\", to which Tyndale allegedly responded: \"I defy the Pope and all his laws; and if God spares my life, ere many years, I will cause the boy that driveth the plow to know more of the Scriptures than thou dost!\"\nTyndale left for London in 1523 to seek sponsorship and permission to translate the Bible into English. He asked to join the household of London Bishop Cuthbert Tunstall, a well-known classicist who had worked with Erasmus, his friend, on the second edition of his Latin/Greek New Testament. The bishop, however, declined to fund Tyndale, explaining that his household was already full with scholars. Tyndale preached and studied \"at his book\" in London for some time, relying on the help of cloth merchant Humphrey Monmouth. During this time, he lectured widely, including at St Dunstan-in-the-West at Fleet Street in London.\nIn Europe.\nTyndale left England for continental Europe, perhaps at Hamburg, in the spring of 1524, possibly traveling on to Wittenberg. There is an entry in the matriculation registers of the University of Wittenberg of the name \"Guillelmus Daltici ex Anglia\", and this has been taken to be a Latinisation of \"William Tyndale from England\". He began translating the New Testament at this time, possibly in Wittenberg, completing it in 1525 with assistance from Observant Friar William Roy.\nIn 1525 the publication of the work by Peter Quentell in Cologne was interrupted by the impact of anti-Lutheranism. A full edition of the New Testament was produced in 1526 by printer Peter Sch\u00f6ffer the Younger in Worms, a free imperial city then in the process of adopting Lutheranism. More copies were soon printed in Antwerp. It was smuggled from continental Europe into England and Scotland by putting pages in between other legal books. The translation was condemned in October 1526 by Bishop Tunstall, who issued warnings to booksellers, bought all the available copies, and had them burned in public. Marius notes that the \"spectacle of the scriptures being put to the torch... provoked controversy even amongst the faithful.\" Cardinal Wolsey condemned Tyndale as a heretic, first stated in open court in January 1529.\nFrom an entry in George Spalatin's diary for 11 August 1526, Tyndale remained at Worms for about a year. It is not clear exactly when he moved to Antwerp. Here he stayed at the house of Thomas Poyntz. The colophon to Tyndale's translation of Genesis and the title pages of several pamphlets from this time purported to have been printed by Hans Lufft at Marburg, but this is a false address. Lufft, the printer of Luther's books, never had a printing press at Marburg.\nHenry VIII asked Emperor Charles V to have the writer apprehended and returned to England under the terms of the Treaty of Cambrai; however, the emperor responded that formal evidence was required before extradition. In 1531 he asked Stephen Vaughan to persuade Tyndale to retract his heretical opinions and return to England. Vaughan tried to persuade Tyndale, and forwarded copies of his books, but this did not satisfy the king.\nTyndale developed his case in \"An Answer unto Sir Thomas More's Dialogue\".\nOpposition to Henry VIII's annulment.\nIn 1530, from exile, he wrote \"The Practice of Prelates\", opposing Henry VIII's desire to secure the annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon in favour of Anne Boleyn, on the grounds that it was unscriptural and that it was a plot by Cardinal Wolsey to get Henry entangled in the papal courts of Pope Clement VII.\nHistorian Bruce Boehrer writes that for Tyndale the issue related to the perspicacity of literal scripture: \"I suspect he (Tyndale) undercut the arguments of both Church and King because he found both to be based upon an objectionable premise: that the word of God should be subject to the final arbitrament of a single man.\"\nBetrayal and death.\nEventually, Tyndale was betrayed by Henry Phillips to ducal authorities representing the Holy Roman Empire. He was seized at the English House in Antwerp in 1535, situated in the same block of houses as the world's 1st Stock Exchange and held in the castle of Vilvoorde (Filford) near Brussels. \nFollowing the insurrections of the Albigensians, the Lollards, the Hussites, the German Peasants' War, the M\u00fcnster Anabaptist rebellion, etc., heresy was connected by states with sedition and possible regicide; it carried, at worst, the death penalty of burning at the stake. The Church could usually protect someone accused of heresy from being charged by the state, if that person satisfied the appointed theologian inquisitor, in a formal process, that they did not (now) hold heretical views.\nIn Tyndale's case, he was held in prison for a year and a half: his Roman Catholic inquisitor, Jacobus Latomus, gave him the opportunity to write a book stating his views; Latomus wrote a book in response to convince him of his errors; Tyndale wrote two in reply; Latomus wrote two further books in response to Tyndale. Latomus' three books were subsequently published as one volume: in these it can be seen that the discussion on heresy revolves around the contents of three other books Tyndale had written on topics like justification by faith, free will, the denial of the soul, and so on. See Latomus' report of Tyndale's beliefs below. Latomus makes no mention of unauthorized Bible translation; indeed, it seems that in prison, Tyndale was allowed to continue making translations from the Hebrew. Thomas Cromwell was involved in some intercession or plans such as extradition.\nWhen Tyndale could not be convinced to abjure, he was handed over to the Brabantine secular arm and tried on charges of Lutheran heresy in 1536. The charges did not mention Bible translation, which was not illegal in the Netherlands.\nHe was found guilty by his own admission and condemned to be executed. Tyndale \"was strangled to death while tied at the stake, and then his dead body was burned\". His final words, spoken \"at the stake with a fervent zeal, and a loud voice\", were reported later as \"Lord! Open the King of England's eyes.\" The traditional date of commemoration is 6 October, but records of Tyndale's imprisonment suggest that the actual date of his execution was some weeks earlier. Foxe gives 6 October as the date of commemoration (left-hand date column), but gives no date of death (right-hand date column). Biographer David Daniell states his date of death only as \"one of the first days of October 1536\".\nSequelae.\nWithin four years of Tyndale's death, a sequence of four English translations of the Bible were published in England at the king's behest, revising Tyndale's versions of the New Testament and Pentateuch with various objectionable features removed: Miles Coverdale's, Thomas Matthew's, Richard Taverner's, and the Great Bible.\nTheological views.\nTyndale was conjectured by Donald Smeeton to have come out of the Lollard tradition, which Smeeton argued was strong in Gloucestershire, but later scholars have cast doubt on these claims. Tyndale denounced the practice of prayer to saints. He also rejected the view that the scriptures could be interpreted only by approved clergy. While his views were influenced by Luther, Tyndale also deliberately distanced himself from the German reformer on several key theological points, adopting a more symbolical interpretation of the Lord's Supper in opposition to Luther's doctrine of the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Tyndale was very much interested in what has become known as covenant theology (\"\"Seek therefore in the scripture, as thou readest it, chiefly and above all, the covenants made between God and us\"), and took what has come to be thought of as a Calvinist stance on many issues, including the atonement (\"Christ's blood only putteth away all the sin that ever was, is, or shall be, from them that are elect\").\nHis Reformation sacramentology will surprise some modern evangelicals, (\"the sacraments which Christ ordained preach God's word unto us, and therefore justify, and minister the Spirit to them that believe\"\").\u2014\u200a\nLatomus' report of Tyndale's beliefs.\nThe following section is mainly based on the English version of \"Jacob Latomus His Three Books of Confutations Against William Tyndale.\" The books of Tyndale's replies were never published and have not survived, but the particular views that lead to his conviction as a heretic may be gleaned from Latomus' summary and responses. \nJacobus Latomus began his initial book, attempting to get Tyndale to abjure his Lutheranism, by stating six broad beliefs which he believed both Tyndale and Catholics held:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;* \"that all Holy Writ is divinely inspired, and that every part thereof is true, as being divinely revealed\nThe first book of Latomus then gives numerous descriptions of where Tyndale's opinion, as he understood it, differed from Catholic dogma or doctrine.\nIn Latomus' second book he quotes Tyndale that \"God the Father so grants all things freely through Christ that he gives nothing in respect of any work or because of any work inward or outward\" and comments that, while it is so for predestination, election, and adoption, Catholic doctrine is that human merit has a place in beatification, crowning, and rewarding. \nLatomus' third book is divided into topics whose headings can be taken as his summary of Tyndale's divergence from pre-Tridentine Catholic dogma or doctrine, ending his lengthy inquiry. Due to these, in combination, Latomus was unable to pronounce Tyndale an orthodox Catholic, or to convince him to abjure, and so could not prevent Tyndale from being executed by the state as a recruiting Lutheran threat.\nPrinted works.\nAlthough best known for his translation of the Bible, Tyndale was also an active writer and translator. As well as his focus on how religion should be lived, he had a focus on political issues.\nLegacy.\nImpact on English Bibles.\nThe translators of the Revised Standard Version in the 1940s noted that Tyndale's translation, including the 1537 Matthew Bible, inspired the translations that followed: The Great Bible of 1539; the Geneva Bible of 1560; the Bishops' Bible of 1568; the Douay-Rheims Bible of 1582\u20131609; and the King James Version of 1611, of which the RSV translators noted: \"It [the KJV] kept felicitous phrases and apt expressions, from whatever source, which had stood the test of public usage. It owed most, especially in the New Testament, to Tyndale\".\nGeorge Steiner in his book on translation \"After Babel\" refers to \"the influence of the genius of Tyndale, the greatest of English Bible translators.\"\nMemorials.\nA memorial to Tyndale stands in Vilvoorde, Flanders, where he was executed. It was erected in 1913 by Friends of the Trinitarian Bible Society of London and the Belgian Bible Society. There is also a small William Tyndale Museum in the town, attached to the Protestant church. A bronze statue by Sir Joseph Boehm commemorating the life and work of Tyndale was erected in Victoria Embankment Gardens on the Thames Embankment, London, in 1884. It shows his right hand on an open Bible, which is itself resting on an early printing press. A life-sized bronze statue of a seated William Tyndale at work on his translation by Lawrence Holofcener (2000) was placed in the Millennium Square, Bristol, United Kingdom.\nThe Tyndale Monument was built in 1866 on a hill above his supposed birthplace, North Nibley, Gloucestershire. A stained-glass window commemorating Tyndale was made in 1911 for the British and Foreign Bible Society by James Powell and Sons. In 1994, after the Society had moved their offices from London to Swindon, the window was reinstalled in the chapel of Hertford College in Oxford. Tyndale was at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, which became Hertford College in 1874. The window depicts a full-length portrait of Tyndale, a cameo of a printing shop in action, some words of Tyndale, the opening words of Genesis in Hebrew, the opening words of St John's Gospel in Greek, and the names of other pioneering Bible translators. The portrait is based on the oil painting that hangs in the college's dining hall. A stained glass window by Arnold Robinson in Tyndale Baptist Church, Bristol, also commemorates the life of Tyndale.\nSeveral colleges, schools and study centres have been named in his honour, including Tyndale House (Cambridge), Tyndale University (Toronto), the Tyndale-Carey Graduate School affiliated to the Bible College of New Zealand, William Tyndale College (Farmington Hills, Michigan), and Tyndale Theological Seminary (Shreveport, Louisiana, and Fort Worth, Texas), the independent Tyndale Theological Seminary in Badhoevedorp, the Netherlands, Tyndale Christian School in South Australia, Tyndale Park Christian School in New Zealand, and Tyndale Christian School in Arlington County, Virginia, in the United States. An American Christian publishing house, also called Tyndale House, was named after Tyndale.\nThere is an Anglican communion setting in memoriam William Tyndale, \"The Tyndale Service\", by David Mitchell.\nLiturgical commemoration.\nBy tradition Tyndale's death is commemorated on 6 October. There are commemorations on this date in the church calendars of members of the Anglican Communion, initially as one of the \"days of optional devotion\" in the American Book of Common Prayer (1979), and a \"black-letter day\" in the Church of England's Alternative Service Book. The Common Worship that came into use in the Church of England in 2000 provides a collect proper to 6 October (Lesser Festival), beginning with the words:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Lord, give your people grace to hear and keep your word that, after the example of your servant William Tyndale, we may not only profess your gospel but also be ready to suffer and die for it, to the honor of your name;\nTyndale is honored in the Calendar of saints of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America as a translator and martyr the same day.\nPersonality and character.\nIn his own words, Tyndale was \"evil-favoured in this world, and without grace in the sight of men, speechless and rude, dull and slow-witted\".\nTyndale wrote it had been his duty to translate the New Testament and reveals a confrontational style, saying, \"In burning the New Testament they did none other thing than I looked for; no more shall they do, if they burn me also, if it be God's will it shall be so. Nevertheless, in translating the New Testament I did my duty...\"\nHis contemporary theological opponent Thomas More, who never met Tyndale personally, charitably described Tyndale as \"a man of sober and honest living who was well educated, well liked, and a good preacher.\"\nTyndale fought with another reformer George Joye who wrote in 1535: \"Let every man be ware how he medle with Tin[dale],\" finding him disdainful, conceited, hypocritical and unwilling to have his Bible translations corrected.\nJohn Foxe, writing in around 1562, considered Tyndale \"simple and inexpert\" in \"the wily subtleties of this world.\"\nThe view of Tyndale given by a recent biography has been summarized as a \"difficult, aggressive, unworldly and monomaniacal man.\"\nAnother modern biographer alludes to Tyndale's reputation as a \"trouble-maker\". The famous ploughboy story attributed to him takes place as a heated argument at a dinner party.\nWorks about Tyndale.\nThe first biographical film about Tyndale, titled \"William Tindale\", was released in 1937. Arnold Wathen Robinson depicted Tyndale's life in stained glass windows for the Tyndale Baptist Church ca. 1955. The 1975 novel \"The Hawk that Dare Not Hunt by Day\" by Scott O'Dell fictionalizes Tyndale and the smuggling of his Bible into England. The film \"God's Outlaw: The Story of William Tyndale\", was released in 1986. The 1998 film \"Stephen's Test of Faith\" includes a long scene with Tyndale, how he translated the Bible, and how he was put to death.\nA cartoon film about his life, titled \"Torchlighters: The William Tyndale Story\", was released ca. 2005. The documentary film, \"William Tyndale: Man with a Mission\", was released ca. 2005. The movie included an interview with David Daniell. In 2007, the 2-hour Channel 4 documentary, \"The Bible Revolution\", presented by Rod Liddle, details the roles of historically significant English Reformers John Wycliffe, William Tyndale, and Thomas Cranmer. The \"Battle for the Bible\" (2007) episode of the PBS \"Secrets of the Dead\" series, narrated by Liev Schreiber, features Tyndale's story and legacy and includes historical context. This film is an abbreviated and revised version of the PBS/Channel 4 version.\nHe has also appeared as a character in two plays dealing with the King James Bible, Howard Brenton's \"Anne Boleyn\" (2010) and David Edgar's \"Written on the Heart\" (2011).\nIn 2011, BYUtv produced a documentary miniseries, \"Fires of Faith\", on the creation of the King James Bible, which focused heavily on Tyndale's life. In 2013, BBC Two aired a 60-minute documentary \"The Most Dangerous Man in Tudor England\", written and presented by Melvyn Bragg.\nAnother known documentary is the film \"William Tyndale: His Life, His Legacy\".\nFurther short documentary is They Valued the Bible\u2014Excerpt (William Tyndale)\nTyndale's pronunciation.\nTyndale was writing at the beginning of the Early Modern English period. His pronunciation must have differed in its phonology from that of Shakespeare at the end of the period. In 2013 linguist David Crystal made a transcription and a sound recording of Tyndale's translation of the whole of the Gospel of Matthew in what he believes to be the pronunciation of the day, using the term \"original pronunciation\". The recording has been published by The British Library on two compact discs with an introductory essay by Crystal.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAttribution:\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "37670", "revid": "19811170", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37670", "title": "Pope John XXII", "text": "Head of the Catholic Church from 1316 to 1334\nPope John XXII (, , ; 1244 \u2013 4 December 1334), born Jacques Du\u00e8ze (or d'Euse), was head of the Catholic Church from 7 August 1316 to his death, in December 1334. He was the second and longest-reigning Avignon Pope, elected by the Conclave of Cardinals, which was assembled in Lyon. Like his predecessor, Clement V, Pope John centralized power and income in the Papacy and lived a princely life in Avignon.\nJohn opposed the policies of Louis IV the Bavarian as Holy Roman Emperor, which prompted Louis to invade Italy and set up an antipope, Nicholas V. John also opposed the Franciscan understanding of the poverty of Christ and his apostles, promulgating multiple papal bulls to enforce his views. This led William of Ockham to write against unlimited papal power.\nFollowing a three-year process, John canonized Thomas Aquinas on 18 July 1323. One of John's sermons on the beatific vision caused controversy which lasted until he retracted his views just before his death. John died in Avignon on 4 December 1334.\nEarly life and election.\nBorn in 1244, Jacques was the son of Arnaud Du\u00e8ze, who was probably a merchant or banker. He studied canon law at Montpellier and theology in Paris. Jacques taught civil law at Cahors and later canon law at Toulouse. By 1295, he was counselor to Bishop Louis of Toulouse. Following Louis's death in 1297, Jacques was installed as the temporary chancellor of the University of Avignon and by 1299 was canon of Puy. On the recommendation of Charles II of Naples he was made Bishop of Fr\u00e9jus in 1300. Jacques was still bishop of Fr\u00e9jus when in 1307, a knight named William d'Arcis and a priest named Bertrand Recordus attempted to kill him. Both of them were imprisoned and in 1309 were sentenced to death.\nIn 1308, Jacques was appointed chancellor of Charles II, and it was due to his influence that the gladiatorial games in Naples were banned. On 18 March 1310, he was made Bishop of Avignon. He delivered legal opinions favorable to the suppression of the Templars, but he also defended Boniface VIII and the Bull \"Unam Sanctam\". On 23 December 1312, Clement V made him Cardinal-Bishop of Porto-Santa Rufina.\nThe limits of papal power became a source of conflict between reigning pope Clement V and Emperor Henry VII, culminating with the sudden death of Pope Clement V in 1314. The period that followed was an interregnum of two years due to disagreements between the cardinals, who were split into three factions. After two years of inaction, Philip, Count of Poitiers summoned a papal conclave of 23 cardinals to Lyon in August 1316. Philip forbade the cardinals from leaving until they had chosen a new Pope. On 7 August 1316, this conclave elected Jacques, who took the name John XXII and was crowned in Lyon. He set up his residence in Avignon rather than Rome, continuing the Avignon Papacy of his predecessor.\nPapacy.\nUpon his election, John gave 35,000 florins, of the 70,000 left to him by Clement V, to the cardinals that had voted for him. He was an excellent administrator and efficient at reorganizing the Catholic Church. He favored a regulation-heavy form of governance. John was known to have a temper, and involved himself in the politics and religious movements of many European countries in order to advance the interests of the papacy. He would routinely write to non-Catholic leaders asserting his authority over them.\nOn 7 April 1317, John canonized Louis of Toulouse with the papal bull \"Sol oriens\". In 1318, he sent a letter of thanks to the Muslim ruler \u00d6zbeg Khan, who was tolerant of Christians and treated them kindly. John has traditionally been credited with having composed the prayer \"Anima Christi\", which has become the English \"Soul of Christ, sanctify me\u00a0...\". On 27 March 1329, John condemned many writings of Meister Eckhart as heretical in his papal bull \"In Agro Dominico\". He allowed the consuls of Cahors to establish a small university in that city.\nIn June 1332, John declared his intention to move his residence to Bologna. In preparation of this, the cardinal legate, Bertrand du Pouget, had been working for years in Bologna to oversee the construction of a papal palace and to integrate the political climate for the papacy's arrival. By August, however, John deemed the safety of the city insufficient. The Bishop of Embrun, Bertrand de Deaux, arrived to assist Pouget but simply exacerbated the situation. This led to a revolt in 1334, Pouget's expulsion, and death threats for any member of the Curia. The papal palace was destroyed and it took John's successor, Benedict XII, many years to find peace with Bologna. John died in Avignon on 4 December 1334 (aged 89/90). He was buried in Avignon, at the cathedral of Notre-Dame-des-Doms.\nEdward II and Irish bishoprics.\nJohn received an embassy, in December 1316, from Edward II of England concerning the empty bishoprics of Dublin and Cashel. Edward presented his preferred appointees and was adamant that John not promote any native Irishman to bishop or archbishop. John promoted William FitzJohn, bishop of Ossory to the bishopric of Cashel, while Alexander Bicknor, a personal recommendation of Edward, was given Dublin.\nIn January 1318, John sent a congratulatory letter to Edward II on his victory over Edward Bruce. He had passed an excommunication of all enemies of Edward II and later singled out Robert and Edward Bruce. John had allowed Edward II to keep the crusade tax imposed by the Council of Vienne, while reminding him that England was a papal fief and that he owed John an oath of loyalty. A few months later, John heard from Irish princes petitioning for the replacement of Edward II as sovereign lord of Ireland, stating that successive kings of England had not respected the papal grant of Ireland to Henry II of England. John's letter to Edward implied that a second papal evaluation of the lordship of Ireland was not out of the question.\nCanonization of Thomas Aquinas.\nBy November 1317, Guillelmo de Tocco, Prior of the Benevento Dominican monastery, was heading a preliminary investigation into Thomas Aquinas' sainthood. In the summer of 1318, John met with de Tocco, who presented letters from the regal heads of Sicily imploring for a papal inquiry into the sainthood of Aquinas. De Tocco also presented John with notarized records of Aquinas's miracles and requests from princes and universities asking for Aquinas's canonization. John chose three cardinals, none of whom was a Dominican, to scrutinize the presented records. Finding no errors, they gave their recommendation to John. John then issued two letters, nominating as papal commissioners: Umberto, Archbishop of Naples; Angelo, Bishop of Viterbo; and Pandulpho de Sabbello, who was unable to attend.\nDe Tocco gathered two of the three papal commissioners in the Archbishop's palace in Naples and the inquiry lasted from 21 July to 18 September 1319. On the final day, the documentation of the inquiry was signed, sealed and sent to the Papal Curia at Avignon. Upon receiving the documents, John turned them over to a cardinal committee. On 23 June 1321, John created a new commission consisting of Peter Ferri, Bishop of Agnani, Andrew, Bishop of Terracina, and Pandulpho de Sabbello. This inquiry lasted fifteen days, during which the commission heard the testimony of 111 witnesses. The commission sent finalized documents to the Papal Curia and John XXII canonized Thomas Aquinas formally on 18 July 1323.\nConflict with Louis IV.\nPrior to John XXII's election, a contest had begun for the Holy Roman Empire's crown between Louis IV the Bavarian and Frederick I of Austria. Initially, John was neutral and refrained from being an arbiter. On 25 November 1314, Louis, with the votes from five of the seven electors, was crowned king of the Germans at Aachen, by the archbishop of Mainz, while Frederick received only two votes the day before. In response, in April 1317, John imposed a new concept, \"vacante imperio\", granting the power to administer the empire to the pope, which was contained within the papal bull \"Si fratrum\".\nBy 1322, faced with a growing Ghibelline movement in northern Italy, John had instructed his papal legate, Bertrand du Poujet, to call for a crusade against Milan. Louis, acting with Imperial powers, sent an army to reinforce Milan in early 1323. In response, John detailed violations committed by Louis and upon receiving no response excommunicated him on 23 March 1324 and then deposed him on 11 July. Louis called a council of Italian Ghibellines to Trent, where Louis declared his support for the Spiritualist Franciscans and denounced John as an illegitimate and heretical pope. John retaliated by declaring any city to offer Louis welcome would be placed under interdict. He received an embassy from Rome which issued an ultimatum of either returning to Rome or suffering the Holy City's submission to Louis IV. John sent his papal legate, Giovanni Orsini, to Rome, but Orsini was denied entry. In reprisal, Orsini placed Rome under interdict.\nLouis entered Rome on 17 January 1328. In St. Peter's cathedral, he was consecrated by two sympathetic cardinal bishops, and crowned by Rome's representative, Sciarra della Colonna. Pietro Rainalducci was created Antipope Nicholas V in May 1328, by Louis. In response, John, using the death of archbishop Matthias von Buchegg to gain an ecclesiastical and political edge, appointed Heinrich von Virneburg as Archbishop of Mainz to assist in the struggle against the Emperor. Following Louis's coronation of Nicholas V, Franciscan Minister General Michael Cesena, Bonagrazia Bergamo, and William of Ockham all fled Avignon. In 1330, Antipope Nicholas V submitted just before the Pope's death.\nFranciscan poverty.\nJohn XXII was determined to suppress what he considered to be the excesses of the Spirituals, who contended eagerly for the view that Christ and his apostles had possessed absolutely nothing, citing in support of their view Pope Nicholas III's bull \"Exiit qui seminat\". On 7 October 1317, John XXII promulgated the bull \"Quorumdam exigit\", clarifying the earlier bulls issued by Nicholas III and Clement V, \"Exiit qui seminat\" and \"Exivi de paradiso\", and stating unequivocally that obedience was a greater virtue than chastity or poverty. On 26 March 1322, with the bull \"Quia nonnunquam\", he removed the ban on discussion of \"Exiit qui seminat\", and commissioned experts to examine the idea of poverty based on belief that Christ and the apostles owned nothing. The experts disagreed among themselves, but the majority condemned the idea on the grounds that it would deny the church's right to have possessions. The Franciscan chapter held in Perugia in June 1322 responded with two encyclicals stating that all judgments made by the Roman Church were to be regarded as final and could not be revoked if they were not erroneous. By the bull \"Ad conditorem canonum\" of 8 December 1322, John XXII declared it ridiculous to pretend that every scrap of food given to the friars and eaten by them belonged to the pope, refused to accept ownership over the goods of the Franciscans in future and granted them exemption from the rule that absolutely forbade ownership of anything even in common, thus forcing them to accept ownership. On 12 November 1323, he issued the bull \"Quum inter nonnullos\", which declared \"erroneous and heretical\" the doctrine that Christ and his apostles had no possessions whatsoever.\nInfluential members of the order protested, such as the minister general Michael of Cesena, the English provincial William of Ockham, and Bonagratia of Bergamo. In reply to the argument of his opponents that Nicholas III's bull \"Exiit qui seminat\" was fixed and irrevocable, John XXII issued the bull \"Quia quorundam\" on 10 November 1324, in which he declared that it cannot be inferred from the words of the 1279 bull that Christ and the apostles had nothing, adding: \"Indeed, it can be inferred rather that the Gospel life lived by Christ and the Apostles did not exclude some possessions in common, since living 'without property' does not require that those living thus should have nothing in common.\" With the bull \"Quia vir reprobus\" of 16 November 1329, John replied to Michael of Cesena's \"Appellatio\".\nBeatific vision controversy.\nBetween November 1331 and March 1332, John XXII made four questionable sermons concerning the beatific vision. John argued that those who died in the faith did not see the presence of God until the Last Judgment. This caused a theological controversy concerning the beatific vision. He continued this argument for a time in sermons while he was pope, although he never taught it in official documents. In January 1334, in complete opposition to John XXII, the Faculty of Theology of the Sorbonne stated that after death the blessed souls are raised to the beatific vision. Louis, sensing an opportunity to remove him, conspired with cardinal Napoleone Orsini to depose John at an ecumenical council. John, considered by many to be theologically incompetent, backed down from his position on the day before his death, agreeing that those who die in grace do indeed immediately enjoy the beatific vision.\nRole in witchcraft suppression.\nPope John's reign saw an important change in papal and inquisitorial attitudes towards witchcraft suppression compared to the reign of his predecessors, such as pope Alexander IV. Kors points to the fact that Pope John had been the victim of an assassination attempt via poisoning and sorcery as a personal factor behind this change. As such, Pope John's involvement with witchcraft suppression can be officially traced to his 1326 papal bull \"Super illius specula\" in which he laid out a description of those who engage in witchcraft. Pope John also warned people against not only learning magic or teaching it but against the more \"execrable\" act of performing magic. Pope John stated that anyone who did not heed his \"most charitable\" warning would be excommunicated. Pope John officially declared witchcraft to be heresy, and thus it could be tried under the Inquisition. Although this was the official ruling for the church, Pope John's first order dealing with magic being tried by the Inquisition was in a letter written in 1320 by Cardinal William of Santa Sabina. The letter was addressed to the Inquisitors of Carcassonne and Toulouse. In the letter Cardinal William states that with the authority of Pope John the Inquisitors there were to investigate witches by \"whatever means available\" as if witches were any other heretic. The letter went on to describe the actions of those who would be seen as witches and extended power to the Inquisition for the prosecution of any and all cases that fit any part of the description laid out in the letter.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "37671", "revid": "2366721", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37671", "title": "Aristocracy", "text": "Form of government\nAristocracy (from grc \" ' ()\"\u00a0'rule of the best'; from \" ' ()\"\u00a0'best' and \" \"\" ()\"\u00a0'power, strength') is a form of government that places power in the hands of a small, privileged ruling class, the aristocrats.\nAcross Europe, the aristocracy exercised immense economic, political, and social influence. In Western Christian countries, the aristocracy was mostly equal with magnates, also known as the titled or higher nobility, however the members of the more numerous social class, the untitled lower nobility (petty nobility or gentry) were not part of the aristocracy.\nClassical aristocracy.\nIn ancient Greece, the Greeks conceived aristocracy as rule by the best-qualified citizens\u2014and often contrasted it favorably with monarchy, rule by an individual. The term was first used by such ancient Greeks as Aristotle and Plato, who used it to describe a system where only the best of the citizens, chosen through a careful process of selection, would become rulers, and hereditary rule would actually have been forbidden, unless the rulers' children performed best and were better endowed with the attributes that make a person fit to rule compared with every other citizen in the polity. \nHereditary rule in this understanding is more related to oligarchy, a corrupted form of aristocracy where there is rule by a few, but not by the best. Plato, Socrates, Aristotle, Xenophon, and the Spartans considered aristocracy (the ideal form of rule by the few) to be inherently better than the ideal form of rule by the many (politeia), but they also considered the corrupted form of aristocracy (oligarchy) to be worse than the corrupted form of democracy (mob rule). This belief was rooted in the assumption that the masses could only produce average policy, while the best of men could produce the best policy, if they were indeed the best of men. Later Polybius in his analysis of the Roman Constitution used the concept of aristocracy to describe his conception of a republic as a mixed form of government, along with democracy and monarchy in their conception from then, as a system of checks and balances, where each element checks the excesses of the other.\nModern aristocracy.\nIn modern times, aristocracy was usually seen as rule by a privileged group, the aristocratic class, and has since been contrasted with democracy.\nConcept.\nThe concept evolved in ancient Greece in which a council of leading citizens was commonly empowered. That was contrasted with representative democracy in which a council of citizens was appointed as the \"senate\" of a city state or other political unit. The Greeks did not like the concept of monarchy, and as their democratic system fell, aristocracy was upheld.\nAccording to Tom\u00e1s Fern\u00e1ndez de Medrano, a just and virtuous form of republic is known as \"aristocracy\", meaning the rule of the most virtuous, referred to in Latin as \"Optimates\" because they are regarded as good and honorable. In his 1602 political treatise \"Rep\u00fablica Mista\", Medrano explains how this system arises when a select group of men, distinguished by their virtue, morality, and wisdom, hold authority over the rest, whether broadly or in specific matters, governing solely for the benefit and welfare of the public. A prime example of this was seen in Sparta, whose exceptional governance allowed it to rule Greece for nearly five centuries.\nPlato's concept of aristocracy envisions an ideal state governed by a philosopher-king\u2014a ruler who possesses wisdom and a love for truth. He defines these \"philosopher-kings\" as individuals who \"love the sight of truth.\" To illustrate this idea, Plato uses analogies such as a captain steering a ship and a doctor administering medicine, emphasizing that just as not everyone is naturally suited to navigation or medicine, not everyone is fit to govern. A significant portion of the \"Republic\" is then dedicated to outlining the educational system necessary to cultivate philosopher-kings.\nIn contrast, the 1651 book \"Leviathan\" by Thomas Hobbes describes an aristocracy as a commonwealth in which the representative of the citizens is an assembly by part only. It is a system in which only a small part of the population represents the government; \"certain men distinguished from the rest.\" \nModern depictions of aristocracy tend to regard it not as the ancient Greek concept of rule by the best, but more as an oligarchy or plutocracy\u2014rule by the few or the wealthy.\nDifferentiation.\nAristocracy's corrupt counterpart is oligarchy. Socrates describes oligarchy as a system rife with corruption and instability. As the ruling elite prioritize their own wealth, they enact laws that further concentrate power and resources in their hands. This deepens economic divisions between the rich and the poor, leading to class conflict and internal strife. According to Tom\u00e1s Fern\u00e1ndez de Medrano in his 1602 \"Rep\u00fablica Mista\", oligarchy occurs when a small group of noble or wealthy individuals control public administration but neglect the needs of the poor, prioritizing personal gain over the common good. Such governance inevitably turns into tyranny, as historically seen in Sicily and other ancient oligarchies. \nMedrano also warns against the dangers of aristocratic rule when consumed by internal strife, stating that when the \"Optimates\" (the aristocracy) become driven by anger, hatred, envy, and rivalry, they inevitably destroy themselves and bring ruin to the republic through factionalism and division. Medrano illustrates the dangers of internal discord through historical examples, citing Babylon\u2019s fall to Cyrus, Carthage\u2019s destruction, and Greek disunity under Alexander the Great. He notes that Rome\u2019s decline, from Jugurtha\u2019s downfall to later internal strife, mirrors the fate of Sparta, the Numidians, and other divided civilizations\u2014including Rome itself, as Cato had foreseen.\nHistory.\nAristocracies dominated political and economic power for most of the medieval and modern periods almost everywhere in Europe, using their wealth and land ownership to form a powerful political force. The English Civil War involved the first sustained organised effort to reduce aristocratic power in Europe. \n18th and 19th centuries.\nIn the 18th century, the rising merchant class attempted to use money to buy into the aristocracy, with some success. However, the French Revolution in the 1790s forced many French aristocrats into exile and caused consternation and shock in the aristocratic families of neighbouring countries. After the defeat of Napoleon in 1814, some of the surviving exiles returned, but their position within French society was not recovered.\nThe planter class, owners of large-scale plantations where enslaved Africans produced crops to create wealth for a white elite, dominated political and economic affairs in America for over a century. The London School of Economics: \"The dominant elite in the South before the Civil War were the wealthy landowners who held people in slavery, the so-called \"planter class\". Their influence in politics before the war can best be illustrated by highlighting that of the 15 presidents before Abraham Lincoln, eight held people as slaves while in office.\" While many former slaveowners kept control of their land and remained politically influential, according to C. Vann Woodward, the Civil War weakened and in some cases destroyed the planter aristocracy.\nBeginning in Britain, industrialization in the 19th century brought urbanization, with wealth increasingly concentrated in the cities, which absorbed political power. However, as late as 1900, aristocrats maintained political dominance in Britain, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Austria and Russia, but it was an increasingly-precarious dominion.\n20th century.\nThe First World War had the effect of dramatically reducing the power of aristocrats in all major countries. In Russia, aristocrats were imprisoned and murdered by the communists. After 1900, liberal and socialist governments levied heavy taxes on landowners, spelling their loss of economic power.\nOutside Europe.\nIn the Chola dynasty, the local (village) administration included a \"Sabha (meaning council or assembly in Tamil),\" which consisted entirely of Brahmins from the Brahmadeya villages\u2014which were considered the \"elite\" of the time (i.e being the highest caste in India).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Symbols allow people to go beyond what is known or seen by creating linkages between otherwise different concepts and experiences. All communication is achieved through the use of symbols: for example, a red octagon is a common symbol for \"STOP\"; on maps, blue lines often represent rivers; and a red rose often symbolizes love and compassion. Numerals are symbols for numbers; letters of an alphabet may be symbols for certain phonemes; and personal names are symbols representing individuals. The academic study of symbols is called semiotics.\nIn the arts, symbolism is the use of a concrete element to represent a more abstract idea. In cartography, an organized collection of symbols forms a legend for a map.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"symbol\" derives from the late Middle French masculine noun , which appeared around 1380 in a theological sense signifying a formula used in the Roman Catholic Church as a sort of synonym for 'the credo'; by extension in the early Renaissance it came to mean 'a maxim' or 'the external sign of a sacrament'; these meanings were lost in secular contexts. It was during the Renaissance in the mid-16th century that the word took on the meaning that is dominant today, that of 'a natural fact or object evoking by its form or its nature an association of ideas with something abstract or absent'; this appears, for example, in Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, \"Le Quart Livre\", in 1552. This French word derives from Latin, where both the masculine noun and the neuter noun refer to \"a mark or sign as a means of recognition.\" The Latin word derives from , from a verb meaning 'put together', 'compare', alluding to the Classical practice of breaking a piece of ceramic in two and giving one half to the person who would receive a future message, and one half to the person who would send it: when the two fit perfectly together, the receiver could be sure that the messenger bearing it did indeed also carry a genuine message from the intended person. A literary or artistic symbol as an \"outward sign\" of something else is a metaphorical extension of this notion of a message from a sender to a recipient. In English, the meaning \"something which stands for something else\" was first recorded in 1590, in Edmund Spenser's \"Faerie Queene\".\nConcepts and definitions.\nSymbols are a means of complex communication that often can have multiple levels of meaning. Symbols are the basis of all human understanding and serve as vehicles of conception for all human knowledge. Symbols facilitate understanding of the world in which we live, thus serving as the grounds upon which we make judgments. In this way, people use symbols not only to make sense of the world around them but also to identify and cooperate in society through constitutive rhetoric.\nHuman cultures use symbols to express specific ideologies and social structures and to represent aspects of their specific culture. Thus, symbols carry meanings that depend upon one's cultural background. As a result, the meaning of a symbol is not inherent in the symbol itself but is culturally learned.\nHeinrich Zimmer gives a concise overview of the nature, and perennial relevance, of symbols.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Concepts and words are symbols, just as visions, rituals, and images are; so too are the manners and customs of daily life. Through all of these, a transcendent reality is mirrored. There are so many metaphors reflecting and implying something which, though thus variously expressed, is ineffable, though thus rendered multiform, remains inscrutable. Symbols hold the mind to truth but are not themselves the truth, hence it is delusory to borrow them. Each civilisation, every age, must bring forth its own.\"\nIn the book \"Signs and Symbols\", it is stated that\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSymbols and semiotics.\nSemiotics is the study of signs, symbols, and signification as communicative behavior. Semiotics studies focus on the relationship of the signifier and the signified, also taking into account the interpretation of visual cues, body language, sound, and other contextual clues. Semiotics is linked with linguistics and psychology. Semioticians not only study what a symbol implies but also how it got its meaning and how it functions to make meaning in society. For example, symbols can cause confusion in translation when the same symbol means different things in the source and target languages. A potential error documented in survey translation is the symbol of \"x\" used to denote \"yes\" when marking a response in the English language surveys, but \"x\" usually means \"no\" in the Chinese convention. Symbols allow the human brain continuously to create meaning using sensory input and decode symbols through both denotation and connotation.\nPsychoanalysis, rhetoric, and archetypes.\nAn alternative definition of \"symbol\", distinguishing it from the term \"sign\" was proposed by Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Jung. In his studies on what is now called Jungian archetypes, a sign stands for something known, as a word stands for its referent. He contrasted a sign with a \"symbol\": something that is unknown and that cannot be made clear or precise. An example of a symbol in this sense is Christ as a symbol of the archetype called \"self\".\nKenneth Burke described \"Homo sapiens\" as a \"symbol-using, symbol making, and symbol misusing animal\" to suggest that a person creates symbols as well as misuses them. One example he uses to indicate what he means by the misuse of the symbol is the story of a man who, when told that a particular food item was whale blubber, could barely keep from throwing it up. Later, his friend discovered it was actually just a dumpling. But the man's reaction was a direct consequence of the symbol of \"blubber\" representing something inedible in his mind. In addition, the symbol of \"blubber\" was created by the man through various kinds of learning.\nBurke goes on to describe symbols as also being derived from Sigmund Freud's work on condensation and displacement, further stating that symbols are not just relevant to the theory of dreams but also to \"normal symbol systems\". He says they are related through \"substitution\", where one word, phrase, or symbol is substituted for another in order to change the meaning. In other words, if one person does not understand a certain word or phrase, another person may substitute a synonym or symbol in order to get the meaning across. However, upon learning the new way of interpreting a specific symbol, the person may change his or her already-formed ideas to incorporate the new information.\nJean Dalby Clift says that people not only add their own interpretations to symbols, but they also create personal symbols that represent their own understanding of their lives: what she calls \"core images\" of the person. Clift argues that symbolic work with these personal symbols or core images can be as useful as working with dream symbols in psychoanalysis or counseling.\nWilliam Indick suggests that the symbols that are commonly found in myth, legend, and fantasy fulfill psychological functions and hence are why archetypes such as \"the hero\", \"the princess\" and \"the witch\" have remained popular for centuries.\nSymbolic value.\nSymbols can carry symbolic value in three primary forms: Ideological, comparative, and isomorphic. Ideological symbols such as religious and state symbols convey complex sets of beliefs and ideas that indicate \"the right thing to do\". Comparative symbols such as prestigious office addresses, fine art, and prominent awards indicate answers to questions of \"better or worse\" and \"superior or inferior\". Isomorphic symbols blend in with the surrounding cultural environment such that they enable individuals and organizations to conform to their surroundings and evade social and political scrutiny. Examples of symbols with isomorphic value include wearing a professional dress during business meetings, shaking hands to greet others in the West, or bowing to greet others in the East. A single symbol can carry multiple distinct meanings such that it provides multiple types of symbolic value.\nPaul Tillich.\nPaul Tillich argued that, while signs are invented and forgotten, symbols are born and die. There are, therefore, dead and living symbols. A living symbol can reveal to an individual hidden levels of meaning and transcendent or religious realities. For Tillich a symbol always \"points beyond itself\" to something that is unquantifiable and mysterious; symbols open up the \"depth dimension of reality itself\". Symbols are complex, and their meanings can evolve as the individual or culture evolves. When a symbol loses its meaning and power for an individual or culture, it becomes a dead symbol.\nWhen a symbol becomes identified with the deeper reality to which it refers, it becomes idolatrous as the \"symbol is taken for reality.\" The symbol itself is substituted for the deeper meaning it intends to convey. The unique nature of a symbol is that it gives access to deeper layers of reality that are otherwise inaccessible.\nRole of context in symbolism.\nA symbol's meaning may be modified by various factors including popular usage, history, and contextual intent.\nHistorical meaning.\nThe history of a symbol is one of many factors in determining a particular symbol's apparent meaning. Consequently, symbols with emotive power carry problems analogous to false etymologies.\nContext.\nThe context of a symbol may change its meaning. Similar five-pointed stars might signify a law enforcement officer or a member of the armed services, depending upon the uniform.\nSymbols in cartography.\nSymbols are used in cartography to communicate geographical information (generally as point, line, or area features). As with other symbols, visual variables such as size, shape, orientation, texture, and pattern provide meaning to the symbol. According to semiotics, map symbols are \"read\" by map users when they make a connection between the graphic mark on the map (the \"sign\"), a general concept (the \"interpretant\"), and a particular feature of the real world (the \"referent\"). Map symbols can thus be categorized by how they suggest this connection:\nRelated terms.\nA symbolic action is an action that symbolizes or signals what the actor wants or believes. The action conveys meaning to the viewers. Symbolic action may overlap with symbolic speech, such as the use of flag burning to express hostility or saluting the flag to express patriotism. In response to intense public criticism, businesses, organizations, and governments may take symbolic actions rather than, or in addition to, directly addressing the identified problems.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "37674", "revid": "143391", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37674", "title": "Duck", "text": "Common name for many species of bird\nDuck is the common name for numerous species of waterfowl in the family Anatidae. Ducks are generally smaller and shorter-necked than swans and geese, which are members of the same family. Divided among several subfamilies, they are a form taxon; they do not represent a monophyletic group (the group of all descendants of a single common ancestral species), since swans and geese are not considered ducks. Ducks are mostly aquatic birds, and may be found in both fresh water and sea water.\nDucks are sometimes confused with several types of unrelated water birds with similar forms, such as loons or divers, grebes, gallinules and coots.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"duck\" comes from Old English 'diver', a derivative of the verb 'to duck, bend down low as if to get under something, or dive', because of the way many species in the dabbling duck group feed by upending; compare with Dutch and German 'to dive'.\nThis word replaced Old English / 'duck', possibly to avoid confusion with other words, such as 'end' with similar forms. Other Germanic languages still have similar words for \"duck\", for example, Dutch , German and Norwegian . The word / was inherited from Proto-Indo-European; cf. Latin \"anas\" \"duck\", Lithuanian 'duck', Ancient Greek / ( /) 'duck', and Sanskrit 'water bird', among others.\nA duckling is a young duck in downy plumage or baby duck, but in the food trade a young domestic duck which has just reached adult size and bulk and its meat is still fully tender, is sometimes labelled as a duckling.\nA male is called a drake and the female is called a duck, or in ornithology a hen.\nTaxonomy.\nAll ducks belong to the biological order Anseriformes, a group that contains the ducks, geese and swans, as well as the screamers, and the magpie goose. All except the screamers belong to the biological family Anatidae. Within the family, ducks are split into a variety of subfamilies and 'tribes'. The number and composition of these subfamilies and tribes is the cause of considerable disagreement among taxonomists. Some base their decisions on morphological characteristics, others on shared behaviours or genetic studies. The number of suggested subfamilies containing ducks ranges from two to five. The significant level of hybridisation that occurs among wild ducks complicates efforts to tease apart the relationships between various species.\nIn most modern classifications, the so-called 'true ducks' belong to the subfamily Anatinae, which is further split into a varying number of tribes. The largest of these, the Anatini, contains the 'dabbling' or 'river' ducks \u2013 named for their method of feeding primarily at the surface of fresh water. The 'diving ducks', also named for their primary feeding method, make up the tribe Aythyini. The 'sea ducks' of the tribe Mergini are diving ducks which specialise on fish and shellfish and spend a majority of their lives in saltwater. The tribe Oxyurini contains the 'stifftails', diving ducks notable for their small size and stiff, upright tails.\nA number of other species called ducks are not considered to be 'true ducks', and are typically placed in other subfamilies or tribes. The whistling ducks are assigned either to a tribe (Dendrocygnini) in the subfamily Anatinae or the subfamily Anserinae, or to their own subfamily (Dendrocygninae) or family (Dendrocyganidae). The freckled duck of Australia is either the sole member of the tribe Stictonettini in the subfamily Anserinae, or in its own family, the Stictonettinae. The shelducks make up the tribe Tadornini in the family Anserinae in some classifications, and their own subfamily, Tadorninae, in others, while the steamer ducks are either placed in the family Anserinae in the tribe Tachyerini or lumped with the shelducks in the tribe Tadorini. The perching ducks make up in the tribe Cairinini in the subfamily Anserinae in some classifications, while that tribe is eliminated in other classifications and its members assigned to the tribe Anatini. The torrent duck is generally included in the subfamily Anserinae in the monotypic tribe Merganettini, but is sometimes included in the tribe Tadornini. The pink-eared duck is sometimes included as a true duck either in the tribe Anatini or the tribe Malacorhynchini, and other times is included with the shelducks in the tribe Tadornini.\nMorphology.\nThe overall body plan of ducks is elongated and broad, and they are also relatively long-necked, albeit not as long-necked as the geese and swans. The body shape of diving ducks varies somewhat from this in being more rounded. The bill is usually broad and contains serrated pectens, which are particularly well defined in the filter-feeding species. In the case of some fishing species the bill is long and strongly serrated. The scaled legs are strong and well developed, and generally set far back on the body, more so in the highly aquatic species, which typically feature webbed feet. The wings are very strong and are generally short and pointed, and the flight of ducks requires fast continuous strokes, requiring in turn strong wing muscles. Three species of steamer duck are almost flightless, however. Many species of duck are temporarily flightless while moulting; they seek out protected habitat with good food supplies during this period. This moult typically precedes migration.\nThe drakes of northern species often have extravagant plumage, but that is moulted in summer to give a more female-like appearance, the \"eclipse\" plumage. Southern resident species typically show less sexual dimorphism, although there are exceptions such as the paradise shelduck of New Zealand, which is both strikingly sexually dimorphic and in which the female's plumage is brighter than that of the male. The plumage of juvenile birds generally resembles that of the female. Female ducks have evolved to have a corkscrew shaped vagina to prevent forced copulations.\nDistribution and habitat.\nDucks have a cosmopolitan distribution, and are found on every continent except Antarctica. Several species manage to live on subantarctic islands, including South Georgia and the Auckland Islands. Ducks have reached a number of isolated oceanic islands, including the Hawaiian Islands, Micronesia and the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, where they are often &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;vagrants&lt;/dfn&gt; and less often &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;residents&lt;/dfn&gt;. A handful are endemic to such far-flung islands.\nSome duck species, mainly those breeding in the temperate and Arctic Northern Hemisphere, are migratory; those in the tropics are generally not. Some ducks, particularly in Australia where rainfall is erratic, are nomadic, seeking out the temporary lakes and pools that form after localised heavy rain.\nBehaviour.\nFeeding.\nDucks eat food sources such as grasses, aquatic plants, fish, insects, small amphibians, worms, and small molluscs.\nDabbling ducks feed on the surface of water or on land, or as deep as they can reach by up-ending without completely submerging. Along the edge of the bill, there is a comb-like structure called a pecten. This strains the water squirting from the side of the bill and traps any food. The pecten is also used to preen feathers and to hold slippery food items.\nDiving ducks and sea ducks forage deep underwater. To be able to submerge more easily, the diving ducks are heavier than dabbling ducks, and therefore have more difficulty taking off to fly.\nA few specialized species such as the mergansers are adapted to catch and swallow large fish.\nThe others have the characteristic wide flat bill adapted to dredging-type jobs such as pulling up waterweed, pulling worms and small molluscs out of mud, searching for insect larvae, and bulk jobs such as dredging out, holding, turning head first, and swallowing a squirming frog. To avoid injury when digging into sediment it has no cere, but the nostrils come out through hard horn.\n\"The Guardian\" published an article advising that ducks should not be fed with bread because it damages the health of the ducks and pollutes waterways.\nBreeding.\nDucks generally only have one partner at a time, although the partnership usually only lasts one year. Larger species and the more sedentary species (like fast-river specialists) tend to have pair-bonds that last numerous years. Most duck species breed once a year, choosing to do so in favourable conditions (spring/summer or wet seasons). Ducks also tend to make a nest before breeding, and, after hatching, lead their ducklings to water. Mother ducks are very caring and protective of their young, but may abandon some of their ducklings if they are physically stuck in an area they cannot get out of (such as nesting in an enclosed courtyard) or are not prospering due to genetic defects or sickness brought about by hypothermia, starvation, or disease. Ducklings can also be orphaned by inconsistent late hatching where a few eggs hatch after the mother has abandoned the nest and led her ducklings to water.\nCommunication.\nFemale mallard ducks (as well as several other species in the genus \"Anas\", such as the American and Pacific black ducks, spot-billed duck, northern pintail and common teal) make the classic \"quack\" sound while males make a similar but raspier sound that is sometimes written as \"breeeeze\", but, despite widespread misconceptions, most species of duck do not \"quack\". In general, ducks make a range of calls, including whistles, cooing, yodels and grunts. For example, the scaup \u2013 which are diving ducks \u2013 make a noise like \"scaup\" (hence their name). Calls may be loud displaying calls or quieter contact calls.\nA common urban legend claims that duck quacks do not echo; however, this has been proven to be false. This myth was first debunked by the Acoustics Research Centre at the University of Salford in 2003 as part of the British Association's Festival of Science. It was also debunked in one of the earlier episodes of the popular Discovery Channel television show \"MythBusters\".\nPredators.\nDucks have many predators. Ducklings are particularly vulnerable, since their inability to fly makes them easy prey not only for predatory birds but also for large fish like pike, crocodilians, predatory testudines such as the alligator snapping turtle, and other aquatic hunters, including fish-eating birds such as herons. Ducks' nests are raided by land-based predators, and brooding females may be caught unaware on the nest by mammals, such as foxes, or large birds, such as hawks or owls.\nAdult ducks are fast fliers, but may be caught on the water by large aquatic predators including big fish such as the North American muskie and the European pike. In flight, ducks are safe from all but a few predators such as humans and the peregrine falcon, which uses its speed and strength to catch ducks.\nRelationship with humans.\nHunting.\nHumans have hunted ducks since prehistoric times. Excavations of middens in California dating to 7800 \u2013 6400 BP have turned up bones of ducks, including at least one now-extinct flightless species. Ducks were captured in \"significant numbers\" by Holocene inhabitants of the lower Ohio River valley, suggesting they took advantage of the seasonal bounty provided by migrating waterfowl. Neolithic hunters in locations as far apart as the Caribbean, Scandinavia, Egypt, Switzerland, and China relied on ducks as a source of protein for some or all of the year. Archeological evidence shows that M\u0101ori people in New Zealand hunted the flightless Finsch's duck, possibly to extinction, though rat predation may also have contributed to its fate. A similar end awaited the Chatham duck, a species with reduced flying capabilities which went extinct shortly after its island was colonised by Polynesian settlers. It is probable that duck eggs were gathered by Neolithic hunter-gathers as well, though hard evidence of this is uncommon.\nIn many areas, wild ducks (including ducks farmed and released into the wild) are hunted for food or sport, by shooting, or by being trapped using duck decoys. Because an idle floating duck or a duck squatting on land cannot react to fly or move quickly, \"a sitting duck\" has come to mean \"an easy target\". These ducks may be contaminated by pollutants such as PCBs.\nDomestication.\nDucks have many economic uses, being farmed for their meat, eggs, and feathers (particularly their down). Approximately 3 billion ducks are slaughtered each year for meat worldwide. They are also kept and bred by aviculturists and often displayed in zoos. Almost all the varieties of domestic ducks are descended from the mallard (\"Anas platyrhynchos\"), apart from the Muscovy duck (\"Cairina moschata\"). The Call duck is another example of a domestic duck breed. Its name comes from its original use established by hunters, as a decoy to attract wild mallards from the sky, into traps set for them on the ground. The call duck is the world's smallest domestic duck breed, as it weighs less than .\nHeraldry.\nDucks appear on several coats of arms, including the coat of arms of Lub\u0101na (Latvia) and the coat of arms of F\u00f6gl\u00f6 (\u00c5land).\nCultural references.\nIn 2002, psychologist Richard Wiseman and colleagues at the University of Hertfordshire, UK, finished a year-long LaughLab experiment, concluding that of all animals, ducks attract the most humor and silliness; he said, \"If you're going to tell a joke involving an animal, make it a duck.\" The word \"duck\" may have become an inherently funny word in many languages, possibly because ducks are seen as silly in their looks or behavior. Of the many ducks in fiction, many are cartoon characters, such as Walt Disney's Donald Duck, and Warner Bros.' Daffy Duck. Howard the Duck started as a comic book character in 1973 and was made into a movie in 1986.\nThe 1992 Disney film \"The Mighty Ducks\", starring Emilio Estevez, chose the duck as the mascot for the fictional youth hockey team who are protagonists of the movie, based on the duck being described as a fierce fighter. This led to the duck becoming the nickname and mascot for the eventual National Hockey League professional team of the Anaheim Ducks, who were founded with the name the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. The duck is also the nickname of the University of Oregon sports teams as well as the Long Island Ducks minor league baseball team.\nNotes.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was founded in May 1994. After an important protagonism during early 2000s with its perennial nominee Otto Guevara among the main candidates and reaching third place in 2006 and 2010, it was affected by several corruption scandals and lack of funds, the party gradually suffered a debacle in 2014 ending in fourth on the presidential ticket, and fifth in Parliament. Later losing all its mayors in the mid-term local election of 2016, to finally having bad results in 2018 with Guevara's candidacy reaching only 1% of support and losing all seats in Congress.\nHistory.\nFounded by non-partisan liberals from the Academy and liberal defectors of Social Christian Unity Party, contested the 1998 election with Federico Malavassi as candidate receiving only 0.4% of the vote but succeeding in getting attorney Otto Guevara elected as member of the Legislative Assembly. In this time the party was strongly libertarian and was in favor of minimal government (something quite polemic in a welfare state like Costa Rica when even the right-wing parties as the Social Christians tend to accept social programs and government intervention), legalization of recreational drugs, same-sex marriage, abortion and the like.\nIn 2002, Guevara unsuccessfully ran for president (winning 1.7% of the vote); at the legislative elections, the party won 9.3% of the popular vote and six out of 57 seats. A few weeks after taking office, one Congressman left the party and became independent, leaving PML with five seats. In 2006, Guevara again unsuccessfullyran for president (winning 8.4% of the vote); at the legislative elections, the party won 9.1% of the popular vote and six out of 57 seats. Evangelical pastor Fernando Alexis Castillo Villanueva endorsed the party in this period. In the 2010 general election, Guevara was again the PML's presidential candidate and received 20% of the popular vote; it also increased its number of deputies to nine (even so three of these deputies defects from the party before the end of the legislative period). At the municipal level the party obtain one mayor in 2006 and two in 2010.\nIn its 2014 electoral campaign, the party took a more socially conservative position, totally opposing the legalisation of abortion and rejecting homosexual couples' right to a marriage license.\nThe party suffered a debacle in the 2014 election, as was relegated to fourth place after PAC, PLN and FA parties. It also reduced its congressional representation to less than half (four seats), It was aldo unable to elect any mayor in the 2016 mid-term municipal election. This electoral debacle was also costly, as the party was unable to pay some of its campaign debts to both workers, Social Security, loaners and Banks. As previously, in 2015 another deputy defects; Carmen Quesada, who declares herself independent.\nAlso in 2015, several party members went to trial after being accused of fraud by the State, apparently trying to trick the Electoral Tribunal in paying for trainings that were already cover by the Friedrich Naumann Foundation. Judges sentenced party's vice president, treasurer and accountant to eight years in prison.\nFor the 2018 general election, the party held the first primary election in their history, due to there being more than one members aspiring for the party's nomination for the presidency. The two pre-candidates were Otto Guevara, running for the fifth time, this time under a right-wing populist tone, inspired by the campaigns of Donald Trump. The other candidate was Natalia D\u00edaz, a young, first-time deputy, who promised, if elected, she'll bring a new face to the party and renew its structure and administration. Guevara won with 59.49% of the votes.\nDue to previous fraud allegations against the party, Otto Guevara's campaign had difficulty finding a bank willing to give the party a loan for campaigning. This changed on January 20, when Prom\u00e9rica Bank loaned the party 500 million colones for the purpose of financing their electoral campaign. In November 2019 Guevara announced the foundation of a new political party named Liberal Union as the Libertarian Movement is unable to pay its debts.\nIn 2019, Guevara announced that the party would not take part in elections anymore and that a new formation would be founded named Liberal Union.\nThe party's candidacy was taken originally by credit tycoon Carlos Valenciano Kamer, however he resign soon after arguing health issues. The candidacy was then taken by former president of the Arias Foundation Luis Alberto Cordero Arias receiving only a little more than 3,000 votes and being the least voted candidate of all 25 in that election.\nPolicy positions.\nThe political party generally has a moderately libertarian perspective on policy issues, although sometimes policy proposals on social issues are more conservative, than libertarian, i.e. a legislator introduced legislation that would have banned same-sex couples from adopting or having custody of children.\nDuring the 2014 campaign, the party expressed opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage, although congressman and presidential candidate Otto Guevara has since said that his major concern about legalizing gay marriage is that the debate over such libertarian legislation would distract the nation from more important matters.\nOn most policy issues, the party favors moderate libertarian reforms such as:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Some parasports are forms of adapted physical activities from existing non-disabled sports, while others have been specifically created for persons with a disability and do not have a non-disabled equivalent. Disability exists in four categories: physical, mental, permanent and temporary. At a competitive level, disability sport classifications are applied to allow people of varying abilities to face similar opposition.\nEtymology.\nThe term \"parasports\" arose as a portmanteau of the words paraplegic and sports. Other terms for the concept include adapted sports, adaptive sports, disability sports, and disabled sports. The term Paralympic sports may also be used interchangeably with parasports, though technically this only refers to sports contested at the Paralympic Games.\nOrganization and history.\nOrganized sport for athletes with a disability is generally divided into three broad disability groups: the deaf, people with physical disabilities, and people with intellectual disabilities. Each group has a distinct history, organization, competition program, and approach to sport.\nHearing impairment.\nFormal international competition in deaf sport began with the 1924 Paris \"Silent Games\", organized by the Comit\u00e9 International des Sports des Sourds, CISS (The International Committee of Sports for the Deaf). These games evolved into the modern Deaflympics, governed by the CISS, which maintains separate games for deaf athletes based on their numbers, their special communication needs on the sports field, and the social interaction that is a vital part of sports.\nIntellectual disability.\nSports for persons with intellectual disabilities began to be organized in the 1960s through the Special Olympics movement. This grew out of a series of summer camps organized by Eunice Kennedy Shriver, beginning in 1962. In 1968 the first international Special Olympics were held, in Chicago. Today, Special Olympics provides training and competition in a variety of sports for persons with intellectual disabilities.\nIn 1986, the International Sports Federation for Persons with Intellectual Disability (INAS-FID) was formed to support elite competition for athletes with intellectual disabilities. This was established in contrast to the more participative, \"sport for all\" approach of Special Olympics. For a time, athletes with intellectual disabilities were included in the Paralympic Games. After a cheating scandal at the 2000 Summer Paralympics, where a number of athletes participating in intellectual disability events were revealed to not be disabled, INAS-FID athletes were banned from Paralympic competition, but the ban on intellectually disabled athletes has since been lifted.\nPhysical disability.\nOrganized sport for persons with physical disabilities existed as early as 1911, when the \"Cripples Olympiad\" was held in the U.S.A. One of the successful athletes was Walter William Francis, a Welshman, who won both the running and wrestling championships. Later, events often developed out of rehabilitation programs. Following the Second World War, in response to the needs of large numbers of injured ex-service members and civilians, sport was introduced as a key part of rehabilitation. Sport for rehabilitation grew into recreational sport and then into competitive sport. The pioneer of this approach was Sir Ludwig Guttmann of the Stoke Mandeville Hospital in England. In 1948, while the Olympic Games were being held in London, he organized a sports competition for wheelchair athletes at Stoke Mandeville. This was the origin of the Stoke Mandeville Games, from which evolved both the IWAS World Games and the Paralympic Games. The first official Paralympic Games, which were simultaneously the 9th International Stoke Mandeville Games ('international' having been added when Dutch service personnel first took part in the Games in 1952), were held in Rome in 1960. The 2nd, 3rd and 4th Paralympic Games were simultaneously the 13th, 17th and 21st international Stoke Mandeville Games.\nSports for persons with physical disabilities began to be organized in the US in the late 1960s through Disabled Sports USA. Disabled Sports USA was established in 1967 by disabled military veterans, including Jim Winthers, to help rehabilitate the injured soldiers returning from Vietnam and originally named the National Amputee Skiers Association. In 1970, Hal O'Leary founded the National Sports Center for the Disabled (NSCD) at Winter Park in Colorado. Today, NSCD has 19 certified instructors and more than 1,000 volunteers. Disabled Sports USA has become one of the largest national multi-sport, multi-disability organizations in the United States, serving more than 60,000 wounded warriors, youth and adults annually.\nIn 1975, the Paralympic Games expanded to include those with limb amputations and visual impairments. Individuals with cerebral palsy were allowed to compete beginning in 1980.\nSince 1988, the International Olympic Committee has chosen to validate Disabled Sports (physical disabilities) and incorporate it as a part of the Games: the staging of the Paralympic Games immediately follows the Olympic Games. This scheduling helps to foster greater interest in disabled sports. An investigation published on a Swiss website has shown that more and more International Sports Federations list disabled athletes than any other sportsmen or sportswomen.\nIn 2006, the Extremity Games were formed for people with limb loss or limb difference to compete in extreme sports. College Park Industries, a manufacturer of prosthetic feet, organized this event to give amputee athletes a venue to compete in this increasingly popular sports genre also referred to as action sports. This annual event held in the summer in Orlando, includes competitions in skateboarding, wakeboarding, rock climbing, mountain biking, surfing, moto-x and kayaking. Various organizations, such as Paradox Sports, have arisen to help empower and inspire disabled people through equipping and welcoming them into the extreme sports community.\nAlso in 2006, The Federation de Internationale Powerchair Football Association and The United States Power Soccer Association were formed to standardize the rules of play and promote one of the few competitive team sports for motorized wheelchair users \u2014 powerchair football (or power soccer).\nIn 2007, a group of athletes, coaches, volunteers, and parents based in San Diego split from Special Olympics Southern California to gain local control over disabled athletics programs. This group \u2013 SPORTS for Exceptional Athletes (S4EA) \u2013 serves people with developmental disabilities within the age range of 5 years old through adults. By combining people with and without disabilities, S4EA hopes that participating athletes will interact and form lasting bonds of friendship through shared sports and recreational activities in S4EA's served communities. Although the organization's focus is primarily San Diego County, S4EA has grown from this base to satellite programs in Ventura and Temecula, California.\nCurrently, Paralympic sport is governed by the International Paralympic Committee, in conjunction with a wide range of other international sport organizations.\nToday, there are many sport opportunities throughout the United States for injured service members, including cycling, shooting, wheelchair tennis and basketball, track and field, adapted water sports, and snow skiing. The Army Wounded Warrior Program offers sitting volleyball to injured service members, and some organizations also offer sport opportunities to family and friends of injured service members in addition to the members themselves. Two Paralympic-style multi-sport events exist exclusively for wounded, injured or sick armed services personnel and veterans: the Warrior Games in the United States and the Invictus Games which originated in the United Kingdom.\nSports.\nA wide range of sports have been adapted to be played by people with various disabilities, as well as several that are unique just to disabled athletes, such as goalball. Within each movement, different sports are practiced at different levels; for example, not all sports in the Paralympic movement are part of the Paralympic Games. In addition, many sports are practiced by persons with a disability outside the formal sports movements.\nAdapted sports help society learn about disability. They also can help remove some of the stigma associated with having a disability.\nPickleball is expected to be included in the 2027 Invictus Games that are scheduled to be held in Birmingham, England. Carlisle-based Gaz Golightly, a military veteran and amputee, lobbied for inclusion of the sport after trying various wheelchair sports and deciding pickleball, which already had specialized rules for players in wheelchairs, was by far the most inclusive for wheelchair users.\nTraining.\nThere is evidence to support that the use of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) as a training intervention can be implemented to increase the aerobic fitness, respiratory function, and overall quality of life in this population of athletes. IMT in particular has been shown to improve respiratory muscle function and might help to reduce dyspnea on exertion. Long term physiological adaptations through prolonged training demonstrated within athletes with disabilities include increased respiratory volume, improved executive functions and increased reaction time among other benefits in relation to non athletes in the same age group. Although parasports seem to have a positive impact on the disabled athletes, the impact really can interlude with one another. Specific authors, like Marques and Alves, found that there are pros and cons to a parasport athlete's life. \nInclusion.\nBeginning in the late 1980s and early 1990s, work began within several countries and organizations to include athletes with disabilities in the non-disabled sport system. This included adding events for athletes with disabilities to major games such as the Olympic Games and the Commonwealth Games, and integration of these athletes into non-disabled sports organizations.\nSince 1984, the Olympics have included exhibition events for Paralympic athletes. However, integration of full medal events has not taken place, and the status of athletes with a disability in the Olympic movement remains controversial.\nWithin the Commonwealth Games, athletes with a disability were first included in 1990 Auckland Commonwealth Games, then at the exhibition events in 1994, and at the 2002 Manchester Commonwealth Games they were included as full members of their national teams, making these the first fully inclusive international multi-sport games. This policy has continued with the 2006 Melbourne Commonwealth Games, where Canadian Chantal Petitclerc became the first athlete with a disability to carry her country's flag in the Opening Ceremonies of an integrated games.\nIndividual athletes such as swimmer Natalie du Toit and track athlete Oscar Pistorius have competed as equals against able bodied athletes at various events including the Olympic Games.\nIn 2013, FIFA decided that Austrian footballer Martin Hofbauer could continue to play competitive football with prosthetics after he lost his right lower leg due to cancer.\nThe self-determination theory has been one of the most proven theories on how athletes participate in competitions of this level. Studies have supported this theory especially in intellectually or developmentally disabled athletes. Studies have continued to question the motivation for joining such competitions like the Special Olympics as well as the Paralympic Games. The Motivations for joining the Special Olympics uncover themes among individuals and families for their participation or abstention from these Olympic programs.\nThere are specific strategies that may be employed to increase inclusion of people with disabilities in sports. This includes modifying rules or adapting activities for a particular individual. As well, maintaining a non-competitive focus helps to increase the inclusion of participants with disabilities.\nIncluding children with intellectual disabilities in sports programs in which they play with non-disabled athletes results in these children becoming more involved in mainstream sports, incorporating more physical activity in their daily lives and it increases their interactions with children who are not disabled. It is important for children with disabilities to get different types of support while participating in sports programs, for example, direct support from coaches and other athletes, indirect support from parents and non-human support from therapy dogs. Activities should be modified to suit different types of children's abilities and inclusivity is easier when activities are non-competitive.\nUnified sports.\n\"Unified sports\" involve heterogeneous teams with athletes of mixed ability. Since the 1990s, Special Olympics Unified Sports have been promoting social inclusion through shared sports training and competition. This initiative has expanded globally and now involves more than 700,000 players in 127 countries worldwide. The principle behind unified sports is simple: training together and playing together is a quick path to friendship and understanding.\nThe NBA has been a major supporter of Unified Sports, sponsoring the annual NBA Cares Special Olympics Unified Basketball Game during the NBA All-Star Weekend. The Walt Disney Company, ESPN and Special Olympics are also working on a two-year global initiative that will leverage the power of sports to promote an environment of social inclusion and acceptance.\nDisabled drivers have competed in motorsport versus fully able drivers; for example Alex Zanardi, Albert Llovera, Clay Regazzoni and Jason Watt.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "37688", "revid": "4770293", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37688", "title": "Gaelic football", "text": "Irish team sport, form of football\nGaelic football (; short name \")\", commonly known as simply Gaelic, GAA, or football, is an Irish team sport. A form of football, it is played between two teams of 15 players on a rectangular grass pitch. The objective of the sport is to score by kicking or palming the ball into the other team's goal (3 points) or between two upright posts above the goal and over a crossbar above the ground (1 point).\nPlayers advance the ball up the field with a combination of carrying, bouncing, kicking, hand-passing, and soloing (dropping the ball and then toe-kicking the ball upward into the hands). In the game, two types of scores are possible: points and goals. A point is awarded for kicking or hand-passing the ball over the crossbar, signalled by the umpire raising a white flag. Two points are awarded if the ball is kicked over the crossbar from a 40 metre range marked by a D-shaped arc, signalled by the umpire raising an orange flag. A goal is awarded for kicking the ball under the crossbar into the net (the ball cannot be hand-passed into the goal), signalled by the umpire raising a green flag. Positions in Gaelic football are similar to those in other football codes and comprise one goalkeeper, six backs, two midfielders, and six forwards, with a variable number of substitutes.\nGaelic football is one of four sports (collectively referred to as the \"Gaelic games\") controlled by the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), the largest sporting organisation in Ireland. Along with hurling and camogie, Gaelic football is one of the few remaining strictly amateur sports in the world, with players, coaches, and managers prohibited from receiving any form of payment. Gaelic football is mainly played on the island of Ireland, although units of the Association exist in Great Britain, mainland Europe, North America, Africa, Asia and Oceania.\nThe final of the All-Ireland Senior Championship, held every year at Croke Park, Dublin, draws crowds of more than 80,000 people. Outside Ireland, football is mainly played among members of the Irish diaspora. A notable exception is France, where it has been growing lately, not least in the Celtic region of Brittany. Gaelic Park in New York City is the largest purpose-built Gaelic sports venue outside Ireland. Three major football competitions operate throughout the year: the National Football League and the All-Ireland Senior Championship operate on an inter-county basis, while the All-Ireland Club Championship is contested by individual clubs. The All-Ireland Senior Championship is considered the most prestigious event in Gaelic football.\nUnder the auspices of the GAA, Gaelic football is a male-only sport; however, the related sport of ladies' Gaelic football is governed by the Ladies' Gaelic Football Association. \nSimilarities between Gaelic football and Australian rules football have allowed the development of international rules football, a hybrid sport, and a series of Test matches has been held regularly since 1998.\nHistory.\nWhile Gaelic football as it is known today dates back to the late 19th century, various kinds of football were played in Ireland before this time.\nAncient Mob football (caid).\nThe first legal reference to football in Ireland was in 1308, when John McCrocan, a spectator at a football game at \"Novum Castrum de Leuan\" (the New Castle of the Lyons or Newcastle), was charged with accidentally stabbing a player named William Bernard. A field near Newcastle, County Dublin is still known as the football field. The Statute of Galway of 1527 allowed the playing of \"foot balle\" and archery but banned \"'hokie'\u2014the hurling of a little ball with sticks or staves\" as well as other sports.\nBy the 17th century, the situation had changed considerably. The games had grown in popularity and were widely played. This was due to the patronage of the gentry. Now instead of opposing the games it was the gentry and the ruling class who were serving as patrons of the games. Games were organised between landlords with each team comprising 20 or more tenants. Wagers were commonplace with purses of up to 100 guineas (Prior, 1997).\nThe earliest record of a recognised precursor to the modern game dates from a match in County Meath in 1670, in which catching and kicking the ball were permitted.\nHowever even \"foot-ball\" was banned by the severe Sunday Observance Act of 1695, which imposed a fine of one shilling (a substantial amount at the time) for those caught playing sports. It proved difficult, if not impossible, for the authorities to enforce the Act and the earliest recorded inter-county match in Ireland was one between Louth and Meath, at Slane, in 1712, about which the poet S\u00e9amas Dall Mac Cuarta wrote a poem of 88 verses beginning \"Ba haigeanta\".\nA six-a-side version was played in Dublin in the early 18th century, and 100 years later, there were accounts of games played between County sides (Prior, 1997).\nBy the early 19th century, various football games, referred to collectively as \"caid\", were popular in County Kerry, especially the Dingle Peninsula. Father W. Ferris described two forms of \"caid\": the \"field game\" in which the object was to put the ball through arch-like goals, formed from the boughs of two trees, and; the epic \"cross-country game\", which lasted the whole of a Sunday (after mass) and was won by taking the ball across a parish boundary. \"Wrestling\", \"holding\" opposing players, and carrying the ball were all allowed.\nAccounts from the Irish diaspora.\nSome accounts of traditional Irish football come not from Ireland, but from the Irish diaspora, often in celebrating traditional events such as St Patrick's Day. The largest such communities existed in Britain, the United States, Australia, and New Zealand. Many of the earliest football matches in Australia date back to the 1840s amongst Irish immigrants. In the Colony of South Australia, there are several accounts of Irish football being played at Thebarton in 1843 and again in 1853. There were similar accounts of football in the 1840s in the Colony of Victoria including Melbourne at Batman's Hill and the goldfields in the Colony of Victoria. The account of H C A Harrison, one of the seminal in the history of Victorian football, of Irish rules was that it gave players \"the full ability to kick anybody that came within reach\". Shin-kicking (or hacking) was a major feature of traditional Irish football and also one of the main reasons why it failed to be widely adopted in Australia. Irish football was also played in the Colony of New Zealand in the 1860s and 1870s in Auckland during Thomas Croke's term as Archbishop there. An 1882 theatrical performance in New York portrays a controversial Irish football match on Saint Nicholas Day 6 December 1790 at the school of Champs de Mars in Paris. Despite a large Irish population references to it being played in America before the 1880s are scant. USGAA makes the unsourced claim that matches were played at Hyde Park, San Francisco in the 1850s.\nFirst appearance of modern football.\nDuring the 1860s and 1870s, rugby football started to become popular in Ireland. Trinity College Dublin was an early stronghold of rugby, and the rules of the (English) Football Association were codified in 1863 and distributed widely. By this time, according to Gaelic football historian Jack Mahon, even in the Irish countryside, \"caid\" had begun to give way to a \"rough-and-tumble game\", which even allowed tripping.\nThe first account of what the founders of modern Gaelic football referred to as Irish football dates to 1873. Paddy Begley notes that in County Kerry in 1870 only soccer and rugby were played, although historian Paddy Foley notes that by 1874 a third, very different form of football began to emerge and spread across South-West Ireland. At Killarney, these highly popular matches were virtually indistinguishable from Australian Rules Football (first codified in 1859 and the oldest extant football code globally). This kicking variety of football was even played with an oval ball which became customary in Australia in the 1870s and that scoring was achieved only by kicking goals. A major difference between the two styles is that the Irish variety featured high kicking \"up and under\" whereas in colonial Victoria, the little marks or foot passes were much more common. While the founders of the game were all familiar with or played rugby, including Cusack and Davin, few had played Irish football as it was so rare outside of the South-West, though the influence of this football on the founders was obvious, this is most likely the \"football kicking under the Irish rules\" that Thomas Croke later recalled in County Cork.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIrish football is a great game and worth going a long way to see when played on a fairly laid out ground and under proper rules. Many old people say just hurling exceeded it as a trial of men. I would not care to see either game now as the rules stand at present. I may say there are no rules and therefore those games are often dangerous.\n Maurice Davin, 1884\nIrish historian Garnham, citing R.M. Peter's Irish Football Annual of 1880, argued that Gaelic football did not exist before the 1880s and curious about the origin of the distinctive features believed that clubs from England in 1868 most likely introduced elements of their codes including the \"mark\" (a free kick to players who cleanly catch the ball, which was a feature of the matches played in the 1880s), lack of offside and scoring by kicking between the upright posts. Unable to identify the source of these peculiar traits he concluded that they must have been introduced by Trinity, Cambridge (those known as the 1858 Cambridge Rules) and Blackheath (1862 club rules).\nCounty Limerick was a stronghold of the game in the 1880s, and the Commercials Club in Limerick, founded by employees of Cannock's Drapery Store, was one of the first to impose a set of rules, which was adapted by other clubs in the city. These rules are believed to be the basis for the rules that were later adopted by the GAA and appear to have contained some of the Victorian Rules of 1866. It is not known how or when these Victorian Rules reached Ireland, though many of the goldrush Irish immigrants returned to Ireland during the 1870s and 1880s as the colonial fortunes faded. At a similar point in time, the same football rules were proposed as an alternative to those of soccer and rugby in northern England but did not take root there. Playing the code under its own rules the club (representing County Limerick) later won the inaugural 1887 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final.\nEnglish (Association) football started to take hold, especially in Ulster, in the 1880s. By the mid-1880s it had become so popular that it was feared by many to completely displace Irish football.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBall-playing, hurling, football kicking, according to Irish rules, 'casting', leaping in various ways, wrestling, handy-grips, top-pegging, leap-frog, rounders, tip-in-the-hat, and all such favourite exercises and amusements amongst men and boys, may now be said to be not only dead and buried, but in several localities to be entirely forgotten and unknown.\n Thomas Croke, 1884 letter to Michael Cusack\nIrish football, however, continued its grip on the southern counties. Accounts from 1889 state that the variety of football that was becoming popular in Ireland in 1884 bore little resemblance at all to the old mob football and was received by the public as more a hybrid of English and Scotch football.\nCodification and Administration.\nIrish forms of football were not formally arranged into an organised playing code by the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) until 1884 with the rules widely distributed in 1887. The GAA sought to promote traditional Irish sports, such as hurling, and to reject \"foreign\" (particularly English) imports. The first Gaelic football rules, showing the influence of hurling (and incorporating some of the Victorian Rules of 1866 and 1877) represented the strong desire to differentiate from association football (and rugby)\u2014for example in their lack of an offside rule. The rules were first drawn up by Maurice Davin in 1884 and later published in the \"United Ireland\" magazine on 7 February 1887. The original rules bear many similarities to modern football with the requirement to kick, handpass, and the basic scoring system, however, the original rules also included many Australian features including additional scoring posts (removed later in 1910). The code had already begun to diverge, with the mark being deprecated, the soccer ball being adopted, and carrying the ball not allowed, as such there was no requirement to bounce or solo the ball carrying the ball remained illegal until the turn of the 20th century. The game was intended to promote peace and harmony, rejecting the violence of other football codes, and Davin even included a requirement for players to hold hands with their opponents though this practice fell out of favour.\nOn 15 February 1885, the first game of Gaelic football played under unofficial rules, developed by Maurice Davin, was played at the Fair Green in Callan, County Kilkenny. A local team from Callan played a Kilkenny Commercials team who travelled the 10 1/2 miles from Kilkenny City. 21 men lined up aside &amp; the game finished with no score a piece. The Fair Green was home to John Locke's GAA Club for nearly 100 years until the new facilities were developed alongside. From 1886 the GAA banned tackling.\nGAA rules of 1887.\nThe widely published GAA rules were as follows:\n1. The ground for full teams (21 aside) shall be 140 yards long by 84 yards broad, or as near that size as can be got. The ground must be properly marked by boundary lines. Boundary lines are to be at least five yards from the fences. Note\u2014 There is no objection to a larger ground.\n2. There shall not be less than 14 or more than 21 players a side in regular matches.\n3. There shall be two umpires and a referee. Where the umpires disagree the referee's decision shall be final. There shall also be a goal umpire at each end of the ground to watch for goals and points. The referee shall keep the time, and throw up the ball at the commencement of each goal.\n4. The goalposts shall stand at each end in the centre of the goal line. They shall be 21 feet apart, with a crossbar 8 feet from the ground. Besides the goal posts, there shall be two upright posts standing in each goal line 21 feet from the goal posts. A goal is won when the ball is driven between the goalposts and under the crossbar. A point is counted when the ball is driven over the crossbar, or the goal line, within 21 feet of either goal post.\n5. The captains of the teams shall toss for choice of sides before commencing play, and the players shall stand in two ranks opposite each other in the centre of the field until the ball is thrown up, each holding the hand of one of the other side.\n6. Pushing or tripping behind, holding from behind, catching below knees, or butting with the head, shall be deemed foul, and the player so offending shall be ordered to stand aside for such time as the referee may think fit, and his side cannot substitute another man. Wrestling shall not be allowed.\n7. The time of actual play shall be one hour, and sides are to be changed only at half-time.\n8. When a player drives the ball over the sideline, it shall be thrown back from the point where it first crossed the line by a player on the opposite side. It may be thrown in any direction. When the ball is driven over the goal line, and not through the goal, the goalkeeper shall have a free kick from the goal, and no player on the opposite side to approach nearer than the 21-yard line until the ball is kicked. If the ball is driven over the goal line by a player whose goal line it is, it shall count one point for the opposite side; if driven over the goal line within 21 feet of either goal post, it shall count three points; if through the goal it shall count a goal.\n9. The match shall be decided by the greater number of goals. When no goal is made, or when the goals are even, it shall be decided by the greater number of points.\n10. The ball must be struck with the hand. It may be caught when off the ground, and the player catching it may kick it any way he pleases, but must not carry it or throw it forward. Note. \u2014 There is nothing in this rule to prevent a player from throwing the ball a little in front to allow himself more freedom in kicking it.\n11. Where the rules are broken the referee may allow a free kick if he thinks fit. In such a free kick the ball must be kicked from the ground. No player on the opposite side is to approach nearer than 14 yards until the ball is kicked; but if the free kick is allowed nearer than 14 yards of the goal line, the opposite players need not stand behind that line.\n12. If the ball strikes a bystander near the sideline, except the referee or umpire, it shall be considered out of play and must be thrown in as directed in Rule 8. If it occurs near the goal line it shall be considered out of play and must be kicked from the goal. In the latter case, the referee may allow one point or more if he thinks fit.\n13. The referee shall have, during the match, full power to disqualify any player or order him to stand aside and discontinue play, for any act he may consider unfair, as set out in Rule 6, or for vicious play.\nNo nails or iron tips are allowed on the boots. Strips of leather fastened on the soles will prevent slipping. The dress for hurling and football is to be knee breeches and stockings and shoes or boots.\nGame spreads.\nGaelic football spread throughout the world in the late 19th century. Despite a huge Irish American population there was limited awareness of the game in America, though there was limited knowledge of its rules, apart from that the ball cannot be lifted from the ground by hand, and throttling is banned. It was first played in North America in the 1890s with games being played in both Canada and the United States in 1892. More than a dozen clubs had been established in the US by 1893. The first clubs appeared in England in 1896.\nAround 1900 the game began to resemble more closely to the running game of today, players were able to lift the ball off the ground and run and carry it if they bounced it every 4 yards.\nThe first match played in Australia was in 1902 finding a niche in Queensland during a period when Australian football there was in recess.\nIncreasing nationalism.\nSome Gaelic Athletic Associations began to impose strict nationalistic policies during this time. For example, in Connacht free kicks began to be introduced into some leagues penalising speaking of any language but Irish, and imposing a rule that the referee may speak only in Irish.\nOn Bloody Sunday in 1920, during the Irish War of Independence, a football match at Croke Park was attacked by the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC), including its Auxiliary Division. 14 people were killed and 65 were injured. Among the dead was Tipperary footballer Michael Hogan, for whom the Hogan Stand at Croke Park (completed in 1924) was named.\nIn 1930 the GAA banned children found playing rugby instead of Gaelic football.\n20th century Gaelic football.\nIn 1939, at Yankee Stadium in New York City, Kerry played Galway in front of a crowd of 70,000 spectators.\nBy 1958, Wembley Stadium hosted annual exhibition games of Gaelic football in England, before tens of thousands of spectators.\nLadies' Gaelic football has become increasingly popular with women since the 1970s.\nInteractions with Australia (1967\u2013).\nIn 1967, Australian journalist, broadcaster, and VFL umpire Harry Beitzel, inspired by watching the 1966 All-Ireland senior football final on television, sent an Australian team known as the \"Galahs\" including South Melbourne's Bob Skilton, Richmond's Royce Hart, Carlton's Alex Jesaulenko and Melbourne and Carlton legend Ron Barassi as captain-coach \u2013 to play against Mayo and All-Ireland champions Meath, which was the first recorded major interaction between the two codes.\nWhat then followed is the current International Rules Series between players of both codes and utilizing rules from both codes, which also gives them a chance to represent their country. The GAA chooses the team to represent Ireland, while the AFL chooses the team to represent Australia and has added a stipulation that each member of their team must have been named an All-Australian at least once. The two countries take turns hosting the series, and both countries' and sports' respective most prestigious venues \u2013 Croke Park and the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) \u2013 have hosted series Tests. What is known as the Irish experiment also occurred, with Australian rules football clubs recruiting Gaelic football players. Irishmen who have distinguished themselves in both codes include Dublin's Jim Stynes \u2013 a 1984 minor All-Ireland football champion who became the 1991 Brownlow Medallist, a recipient of the Medal of the Order of Australia and a member of Melbourne's Team of the Century \u2013 and Kerry's Tadhg Kennelly, the first man to become both a senior All-Ireland football champion (2009) and an AFL Premiership player (2005 with Sydney, the Swans' first flag in 72 years).\nRules.\nOverview.\nPlayers advance the football up the field with a combination of carrying, bouncing, kicking, hand-passing, and soloing (dropping the ball and then toe-kicking it upward into the hands). In the game, two types of scores are possible: points and goals. A point is awarded for kicking or hand-passing the ball over the crossbar, signalled by the umpire raising a white flag. A goal is awarded for kicking the ball under the crossbar into the net, signalled by the umpire raising a green flag. Positions in Gaelic football are similar to those in other football codes and comprise one goalkeeper, six backs, two midfielders, and six forwards, with a variable number of substitutes.\nPlaying field.\nA Gaelic pitch is similar in some respects to a rugby pitch but larger. The grass pitch is rectangular, stretching long and wide. There are H-shaped goalposts at each end, formed by two posts, which are usually high, set apart, and connected above the ground by a crossbar. A net extending behind the goal is attached to the crossbar and lower goalposts. The same pitch is used for hurling; the GAA, which organises both sports, decided this to facilitate dual usage. Lines are marked at distances of , , and ( in hurling) from each end-line. Shorter pitches and smaller goals are used by youth teams.\nDuration.\nThe majority of adult football and all minor and under-21 matches last for 60 minutes, divided into two halves of 30 minutes, except for senior inter-county games, which last for 70 minutes (two halves of 35 minutes). Draws are decided by replays or by playing 20 minutes of extra time (two halves of 10 minutes). Juniors have halves of 20 minutes or 25 minutes in some cases. Half-time intermission lasts from 5 to 15 minutes. Championship matches have a 30-minute intermission.\nTeams.\nTeams consist of fifteen players (a goalkeeper, two corner backs, a full back, two wing backs, a centre back, two midfielders, two wing forwards, a centre forward, two corner forwards and a full forward) plus up to fifteen substitutes, of which six may be used. As for younger teams or teams that do not have enough players for fifteen a side, it is not uncommon to play thirteen a side (the same positions except without the full-back and the full forward). Each player is numbered 1\u201315, starting with the goalkeeper, who must wear a jersey colour different from that of his or her teammates. Up to 15 substitutes may be named on the team sheet, number 16 usually being the reserve goalkeeper.\nBall.\nThe game is played with a round leather football made of 18 stitched leather panels, with a circumference of , weighing between when dry. It may be kicked or \"hand-passed\". A hand pass is not a punch but rather a strike of the ball with the side of the closed fist, using the knuckle of the thumb.\nMark.\nIn 2017, the GAA introduced the 'mark' across the board in Gaelic football. Similar to the mark in Australian rules football, a player who catches the ball from a kick-out is awarded a free kick. The rule in full states: \"When a player catches the ball cleanly from a Kick-Out without it touching the ground, on or past the line nearest the Kick-Out point, he shall be awarded 'a Mark' by the Referee. The player awarded a 'Mark' shall have the options of (a) Taking a free kick or (b) Playing on immediately.\" In comparison, the Australian rules equivalent requires the ball not to have touched the ground and for the kick to have travelled at least . In the experimental rules of 2019, a player can now also call a mark inside the opposition's line after a clean catch from a kick played over from outside the line that does not touch the ground or any other player.\nIn 2020, additional versions of the Mark came into force in Gaelic football. The Advanced Mark allowed a ball to be fielded cleanly inside the opposition 45 when kicked forward over a distance greater than from outside the opposition 45. The referee is required to blow the whistle as this occurs, at which point the player has the option to take the Mark or play on.\nThere is also a Defensive Mark, which a defender can get from a long ball played into him.\nTypes of fouls.\nThere are three main types of fouls in Gaelic football, which can result in the ball being given to the other team, a player being cautioned, a player being removed from the field, or even the game being terminated.\nTechnical fouls.\nThe following are considered technical fouls (\"fouling the ball\"):\nAggressive fouls.\nAggressive fouls are physical or verbal fouls committed by a player against an opponent or the referee. The player can be cautioned (shown a yellow card), ordered off the pitch without a substitute (red card), or (as of January 2020) ejected from the match to the Sin Bin, where they must remain for ten minutes before returning to the field (black card). Picking up two black cards risks a red card, and the substitute will serve out whatever time imposed by officials.\nDissent.\nA dissent foul is a foul where a player fails to comply with the officials' judgment and/or instructions. The player can be cautioned (shown a yellow card), ordered off the pitch without a substitute (red card), the free kick placement moved further down-field, or in certain circumstances, the game can be terminated. The following are considered dissent fouls:\nScoring.\nIf the ball goes over the crossbar, a \"point\" is scored and a white flag is raised by an umpire. A point is scored by either kicking the ball over the crossbar or fisting it over, in which case the hand must be closed while striking the ball. If the ball goes below the crossbar, a \"goal\", worth three points, is scored, and a green flag is raised by an umpire. A goal is scored by kicking the ball into the net, not by fist-passing the ball into it. However, a player can strike the ball into the net with a closed fist if the ball was played to him by another player or came in contact with the post/crossbar/ground before connection. The goal is guarded by a goalkeeper. Scores are recorded in the format Goal Total-Point Total. To determine the score-line goals must be converted to points and added to the other points. For example, in a match with a final score of Team A 0\u201321 and Team B 4\u20138, Team A is the winner with 21 points, as Team B scored only 20 points (4 times 3, plus 8).\nTackling.\nThe level of tackling allowed is less robust than in rugby or Australian rules.\nShoulder-to-shoulder contact and slapping the ball out of an opponent's hand are permitted, but the following are all fouls:\nOfficials.\nA football match is overseen by up to eight officials:\nThe referee is responsible for starting and stopping play, recording the score, awarding frees, and booking, and sending off players.\nLinesmen are responsible for indicating the direction of line balls to the referee.\nThe fourth official is responsible for overseeing substitutions and also indicating the amount of stoppage time (signalled to him by the referee) and the players substituted using an electronic board.\nThe umpires are responsible for judging the scoring. They indicate to the referee whether a shot was: wide (spread both arms), a kick (raise one arm), a point (wave white flag), a square ball (cross arms) or a goal (wave green flag). A disallowed score is indicated by crossing the green and white flags.\nOther officials are not obliged to indicate any misdemeanours to the referee; they are only permitted to inform the referee of violent conduct they have witnessed that has occurred without the referee's knowledge. A linesman/umpire is not permitted to inform the referee of technical fouls such as a \"double bounce\" or an illegal pick-up of the ball. Such decisions can only be made at the discretion of the referee.\n2025 rule changes.\nThe GAA held a special congress in November 2024 to consider recommendations of the Football Review Committee. The FRC, led by Jim Gavin, made wide-ranging proposals that altered a number of rule areas.\nThe rule changes broadly cover nine areas, seven of which are directly related to gameplay. A new 40-metre scoring arc has been introduced. Points scored from outside this arc are now worth two points, incentivising long-range shooting. Teams are required to maintain at least three players in both their attacking and defensive halves at all times. \nKick-outs must now travel beyond the 40-metre arc, encouraging longer restarts and minimising short-passing strategies that can slow the game. Goalkeepers are limited in their movements; they can only receive the ball in the opposition half under specific conditions. This change aims to prevent goalkeepers from participating excessively in outfield play. An advanced mark is awarded for clean catches from kick passes that travel over 20 metres into the opposition's 45-metre area, encouraging high-fielding and long kicking.\nPlayers fouled while in possession can opt to continue playing immediately without waiting for the referee's whistle, promoting uninterrupted play. There are additional punishments for dissent, deliberate fouling and cynical play, including an increased number of black card offences and the ball being advanced 50 metres (long a feature in Australian football) when unsportsmanlike conduct, such as not directly giving the ball to a fouled player, occurs after a foul is called.\nMinor amendments to the new rules were recommended by the Football Review Committee, for use in the two remaining league rounds of the 2025 National Football League. \nIn October 2025 a GAA Special Congress formalised the rule changes by adopting them permanently. Minor alterations were made, such as all converted shots from outside the 40-metre arc count as two-point scores provided no other player from the same team as the shooter touches it after it's kicked.\nTeam of the Century.\nThe Team of the Century was nominated in 1984 by \"Sunday Independent\" readers and selected by a panel of experts including journalists and former players. It was not chosen as part of the Gaelic Athletic Association's centenary year celebrations. The goal was to single out the best 15 players who had played the game in their respective positions. Naturally, many of the selections were hotly debated by fans around the country.\nTeam of the Millennium.\nThe Team of the Millennium was a team chosen in 1999 by a panel of GAA past presidents and journalists. The goal was to single out the best 15 players who had played the game in their respective positions, since the foundation of the GAA in 1884 up to the Millennium year, 2000. Naturally, many of the selections were hotly debated by fans around the country.\nCompetition structure.\nGaelic sports at all levels are amateur, in the sense that the athletes, even those playing at an elite level, do not receive payment for their performance.\nThe main competitions at all levels of Gaelic football are the League and the Championship. Of these, it is the Championship (a knock-out tournament) that tends to attain the most prestige.\nThe basic unit of each game is organised at the club level, which is usually arranged on a parochial basis. Local clubs compete against other clubs in their county intending to win the County Club Championship at senior, junior, or intermediate levels (for adults) or under-21, minor or under-age levels (for children). A club may field more than one team, for example, a club may field a team at the senior level and a \"seconds\" team at a junior or intermediate level. This format is laid out in the table below:\nClubs may come together in districts for the County Championship or compete on their own.\nThough the island of Ireland was partitioned between two states by the British parliament in 1920, the organisation of Gaelic games (like that of most cultural organisations and religions) continues on an All-Ireland basis. At the national level, Ireland's Gaelic games are organised in 32 GAA counties, most of which are identical in name and extent to the 32 administrative counties on which local government throughout the island was based until the late 20th century. The term \"county\" is also used for some overseas GAA places, such as London and New York. Clubs are also located throughout the world, in other parts of the United States, in Great Britain, in Canada, in Asia, in Australasia and continental Europe.\nThe level at which county teams compete against each other is referred to as inter-county (i.e. similar to international). A county panel\u2014a team of 15 players, plus a similar number of substitutes\u2014is formed from the best players playing at the club level in each county. The most prestigious inter-county competition in Gaelic football is the All-Ireland Championship. The highest-level national championship is called the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship. Nearly all counties contest this tournament on an annual basis, with crowds of people thronging venues the length and breadth of Ireland\u2014the most famous of these stadiums being Croke Park\u2014to support their local county team, a team comprising players selected from the clubs in that county. These modified knock-out games start as provincial championships contested by counties against other counties in their respective province, the four Irish provinces of Ulster, Munster, Leinster and Connacht. The four victors in these then progress automatically to the All-Ireland series.\nIn the past, the team winning each provincial championship would play one of the others, at a stage known as the All-Ireland semi-finals, with the winning team from each game playing each other in the famed All-Ireland Final to determine the outright winner. A recent (the 1990s/2000s) re-organisation created a \"back door\" method of qualifying, with teams knocked out during the provincial rounds of the All-Ireland Championship now acquiring a second chance at glory. Now the four victorious teams at the provincial level enter the recently created All-Ireland quarter-finals instead, where they compete against the four remaining teams from the All-Ireland Qualifiers to progress to the All-Ireland semi-finals and then the All-Ireland Final. This re-organisation means that one team may defeat another team in an early stage of the championship, yet be defeated and knocked out of the tournament by the same team at a later stage. It also means a team may be defeated in an early stage of the championship, yet be crowned All-Ireland champions\u2014as Tyrone was in 2005 and 2008.\nThe secondary competition at the inter-county level is the National League. The National Football League is held every spring and groups counties into four divisions according to their relative strength. As at local (county) levels of Gaelic football, the League at a national level is less prestigious than the Championship\u2014however, in recent years attendances have grown, as has interest from the public and players. This is due in part to the 2002 adoption of a February\u2013April timetable, in place of the former November start, as well as the provision of Division 2 final stages. Live matches are aired on the international channel Setanta Sports and the Irish language channel TG4, with highlights shown on RT\u00c9 Two.\nThere are also All-Ireland championships for county teams at Junior, Under-21 and Minor levels, and provincial and national club championships, contested by the teams that win their respective county championships.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

More generally, the term \"seed\" means anything that can be sown, which may include seed and husk or tuber. Seeds are the product of the ripened ovule, after the embryo sac is fertilized by sperm from pollen, forming a zygote. The embryo within a seed develops from the zygote and grows within the mother plant to a certain size before growth is halted.\nThe formation of the seed is the defining part of the process of reproduction in seed plants (spermatophytes). Other plants such as ferns, mosses and liverworts, do not have seeds and use water-dependent means to propagate themselves. Seed plants now dominate biological niches on land, from forests to grasslands both in hot and cold climates.\nIn the flowering plants, the ovary ripens into a fruit which contains the seed and serves to disseminate it. Many structures commonly referred to as \"seeds\" are actually dry fruits. Sunflower seeds are sometimes sold commercially while still enclosed within the hard wall of the fruit, which must be split open to reach the seed. Different groups of plants have other modifications, the so-called stone fruits (such as the peach) have a hardened fruit layer (the endocarp) fused to and surrounding the actual seed. Nuts are the one-seeded, hard-shelled fruit of some plants with an indehiscent seed, such as an acorn or hazelnut.\nHistory.\nThe first land plants evolved around 468 million years ago, and reproduced using spores. The earliest seed bearing plants to appear were the gymnosperms, which have no ovaries to contain the seeds. They arose during the late Devonian period (416 million to 358 million years ago). From these early gymnosperms, seed ferns evolved during the Carboniferous period (359 to 299 million years ago); they had ovules that were borne in a cupule, which consisted of groups of enclosing branches likely used to protect the developing seed.\nPublished literature about seed storage, viability and its hygrometric dependence began in the early 19th century, influential works being:\nDevelopment.\nAngiosperm seeds are \"enclosed seeds\", produced in a hard or fleshy structure called a fruit that encloses them for protection. Some fruits have layers of both hard and fleshy material. In gymnosperms, no special structure develops to enclose the seeds, which begin their development \"naked\" on the bracts of cones. However, the seeds do become covered by the cone scales as they develop in some species of conifer.\nAngiosperm (flowering plants) seeds consist of three genetically distinct constituents: (1) the embryo formed from the zygote, (2) the endosperm, which is normally triploid, (3) the seed coat from tissue derived from the maternal tissue of the ovule. In angiosperms, the process of seed development begins with double fertilization, which involves the fusion of two male gametes with the egg cell and the central cell to form the primary endosperm and the zygote. Right after fertilization, the zygote is mostly inactive, but the primary endosperm divides rapidly to form the endosperm tissue. This tissue becomes the food the young plant will consume until the roots have developed after germination.\nOvule.\nAfter fertilization, the ovules develop into the seeds. The ovule consists of a number of components:\nThe shape of the ovules as they develop often affects the final shape of the seeds. Plants generally produce ovules of four shapes: the most common shape is called anatropous, with a curved shape. Orthotropous ovules are straight with all the parts of the ovule lined up in a long row producing an uncurved seed. Campylotropous ovules have a curved megagametophyte often giving the seed a tight \"C\" shape. The last ovule shape is called amphitropous, where the ovule is partly inverted and turned back 90 degrees on its stalk (the funicle or funiculus).\nIn the majority of flowering plants, the zygote's first division is transversely oriented in regards to the long axis, and this establishes the polarity of the embryo. The upper or chalazal pole becomes the main area of growth of the embryo, while the lower or micropylar pole produces the stalk-like suspensor that attaches to the micropyle. The suspensor absorbs and manufactures nutrients from the endosperm that are used during the embryo's growth.\nEmbryo.\nThe main components of the embryo are:\nMonocotyledonous plants have two additional structures in the form of sheaths. The plumule is covered with a coleoptile that forms the first leaf while the radicle is covered with a coleorhiza that connects to the primary root and adventitious roots form the sides. Here the hypocotyl is a rudimentary axis between radicle and plumule. The seeds of corn are constructed with these structures; pericarp, scutellum (single large cotyledon) that absorbs nutrients from the endosperm, plumule, radicle, coleoptile, and coleorhiza\u00a0\u2013 these last two structures are sheath-like and enclose the plumule and radicle, acting as a protective covering.\nSeed coat.\nThe maturing ovule undergoes marked changes in the integuments, generally a reduction and disorganization but occasionally a thickening. The seed coat forms from the two integuments or outer layers of cells of the ovule, which derive from tissue from the mother plant, the inner integument forms the tegmen and the outer forms the testa. (The seed coats of some monocotyledon plants, such as the grasses, are not distinct structures, but are fused with the fruit wall to form a pericarp.) The testae of both monocots and dicots are often marked with patterns and textured markings, or have wings or tufts of hair. When the seed coat forms from only one layer, it is also called the testa, though not all such testae are homologous from one species to the next. The funiculus abscisses (detaches at fixed point\u00a0\u2013 abscission zone), the scar forming an oval depression, the hilum. Anatropous ovules have a portion of the funiculus that is adnate (fused to the seed coat), and which forms a longitudinal ridge, or raphe, just above the hilum. In bitegmic ovules (e.g. \"Gossypium\" described here) both inner and outer integuments contribute to the seed coat formation. With continuing maturation the cells enlarge in the outer integument. While the inner epidermis may remain a single layer, it may also divide to produce two to three layers and accumulates starch, and is referred to as the colourless layer. By contrast, the outer epidermis becomes tanniferous. The inner integument may consist of eight to fifteen layers.\nAs the cells enlarge, and starch is deposited in the outer layers of the pigmented zone below the outer epidermis, this zone begins to lignify, while the cells of the outer epidermis enlarge radially and their walls thicken, with nucleus and cytoplasm compressed into the outer layer. these cells which are broader on their inner surface are called palisade cells. In the inner epidermis, the cells also enlarge radially with plate like thickening of the walls. The mature inner integument has a palisade layer, a pigmented zone with 15\u201320 layers, while the innermost layer is known as the fringe layer.\nGymnosperms.\nIn gymnosperms, which do not form ovaries, the ovules and hence the seeds are exposed. This is the basis for their nomenclature\u00a0\u2013 naked seeded plants. Two sperm cells transferred from the pollen do not develop the seed by double fertilization, but one sperm nucleus unites with the egg nucleus and the other sperm is not used. Sometimes each sperm fertilizes an egg cell and one zygote is then aborted or absorbed during early development. The seed is composed of the embryo (the result of fertilization) and tissue from the mother plant, which also form a cone around the seed in coniferous plants such as pine and spruce.\nShape and appearance.\nSeeds are very diverse, and as such there are many terms are used to describe them. \nStructure.\nA typical seed includes two basic parts:\nIn addition, the endosperm forms a supply of nutrients for the embryo in most monocotyledons and the endospermic dicotyledons.\nSeed types.\nSeeds have been considered to occur in many structurally different types (Martin 1946). These are based on a number of criteria, of which the dominant one is the embryo-to-seed size ratio. This reflects the degree to which the developing cotyledons absorb the nutrients of the endosperm, and thus obliterate it.\nSix types occur amongst the monocotyledons, ten in the dicotyledons, and two in the gymnosperms (linear and spatulate). This classification is based on three characteristics: embryo morphology, amount of endosperm and the position of the embryo relative to the endosperm.\nEmbryo.\nIn endospermic seeds, there are two distinct regions inside the seed coat, an upper and larger endosperm and a lower smaller embryo. The embryo is the fertilised ovule, an immature plant from which a new plant will grow under proper conditions. The embryo has one cotyledon or seed leaf in monocotyledons, two cotyledons in almost all dicotyledons and two or more in gymnosperms. In the fruit of grains (caryopses) the single monocotyledon is shield shaped and hence called a scutellum. The scutellum is pressed closely against the endosperm from which it absorbs food and passes it to the growing parts. Embryo descriptors include small, straight, bent, curved, and curled.\nNutrient storage.\nWithin the seed, there usually is a store of nutrients for the seedling that will grow from the embryo. The form of the stored nutrition varies depending on the kind of plant. In angiosperms, the stored food begins as a tissue called the endosperm, which is derived from the mother plant and the pollen via double fertilization. It is usually triploid, and is rich in oil or starch, and protein. In gymnosperms, such as conifers, the food storage tissue (also called endosperm) is part of the female gametophyte, a haploid tissue. The endosperm is surrounded by the aleurone layer (peripheral endosperm), filled with proteinaceous aleurone grains.\nOriginally, by analogy with the animal ovum, the outer nucellus layer (perisperm) was referred to as albumen, and the inner endosperm layer as vitellus. Although misleading, the term began to be applied to all the nutrient matter. This terminology persists in referring to endospermic seeds as \"albuminous\". The nature of this material is used in both describing and classifying seeds, in addition to the embryo to endosperm size ratio. The endosperm may be considered to be farinaceous (or mealy) in which the cells are filled with starch, as for instance cereal grains, or not (non-farinaceous). The endosperm may also be referred to as \"fleshy\" or \"cartilaginous\" with thicker soft cells such as coconut, but may also be oily as in \"Ricinus\" (castor oil), \"Croton\" and Poppy. The endosperm is called \"horny\" when the cell walls are thicker such as date and coffee, or \"ruminated\" if mottled, as in nutmeg, palms and Annonaceae.\nIn most monocotyledons (such as grasses and palms) and some (endospermic or albuminous) dicotyledons (such as castor beans) the embryo is embedded in the endosperm (and nucellus), which the seedling will use upon germination. In the non-endospermic dicotyledons the endosperm is absorbed by the embryo as the latter grows within the developing seed, and the cotyledons of the embryo become filled with stored food. At maturity, seeds of these species have no endosperm and are also referred to as exalbuminous seeds. The exalbuminous seeds include the legumes (such as beans and peas), trees such as the oak and walnut, vegetables such as squash and radish, and sunflowers. According to Bewley and Black (1978), Brazil nut storage is in hypocotyl and this place of storage is uncommon among seeds. All gymnosperm seeds are albuminous.\nSeed coat.\nThe seed coat develops from the maternal tissue, the integuments, originally surrounding the ovule. The seed coat in the mature seed can be a paper-thin layer (e.g. peanut) or something more substantial (e.g. thick and hard in honey locust and coconut), or fleshy as in the sarcotesta of pomegranate. The seed coat helps protect the embryo from mechanical injury, predators, and drying out. Depending on its development, the seed coat is either bitegmic or unitegmic. Bitegmic seeds form a testa from the outer integument and a tegmen from the inner integument while unitegmic seeds have only one integument. Usually, parts of the testa or tegmen form a hard protective mechanical layer. The mechanical layer may prevent water penetration and germination. Amongst the barriers may be the presence of lignified sclereids.\nThe outer integument has a number of layers, generally between four and eight organised into three layers: (a) outer epidermis, (b) outer pigmented zone of two to five layers containing tannin and starch, and (c) inner epidermis. The endotegmen is derived from the inner epidermis of the inner integument, the exotegmen from the outer surface of the inner integument. The endotesta is derived from the inner epidermis of the outer integument, and the outer layer of the testa from the outer surface of the outer integument is referred to as the exotesta. If the exotesta is also the mechanical layer, this is called an exotestal seed, but if the mechanical layer is the endotegmen, then the seed is endotestal. The exotesta may consist of one or more rows of cells that are elongated and pallisade like (e.g. Fabaceae), hence 'palisade exotesta'.\nIn addition to the three basic seed parts, some seeds have an appendage, an aril, a fleshy outgrowth of the funicle (funiculus), (as in yew and nutmeg) or an oily appendage, an elaiosome (as in \"Corydalis\"), or hairs (trichomes). In the latter example these hairs are the source of the textile crop cotton. Other seed appendages include the raphe (a ridge), wings, caruncles (a soft spongy outgrowth from the outer integument in the vicinity of the micropyle), spines, or tubercles.\nA scar also may remain on the seed coat, called the hilum, where the seed was attached to the ovary wall by the funicle. Just below it is a small pore, representing the micropyle of the ovule.\nSize and seed set.\nSeeds are very diverse in size. The dust-like orchid seeds are the smallest, with about one million seeds per gram, with the record being for \"Anguloa \u00d7 ruckeri\" with a single seed weighing about 0.4\u00a0\u03bcg. They are often embryonic seeds with immature embryos and no significant energy reserves. Orchids and a few other groups of plants are mycoheterotrophs which depend on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrition during germination and the early growth of the seedling. Some terrestrial orchid seedlings, in fact, spend the first few years of their lives deriving energy from fungi and do not produce green leaves. The largest seed is that of \"Lodoicea maldivica\" (coco de mer) at up to . Plants that produce smaller seeds can generate many more seeds per flower, while plants with larger seeds invest more resources into those seeds and normally produce fewer seeds. Small seeds are quicker to ripen and can be dispersed sooner, so autumnal blooming plants often have small seeds. Many annual plants produce great quantities of smaller seeds; this helps to ensure at least a few will end in a favorable place for growth. Herbaceous perennials and woody plants often have larger seeds; they can produce seeds over many years, and larger seeds have more energy reserves for germination and seedling growth and produce larger, more established seedlings after germination.\nFunctions.\nSeeds serve several functions for the plants that produce them. Key among these functions are nourishment of the embryo, dispersal to a new location, and dormancy during unfavorable conditions. Seeds fundamentally are means of reproduction, and most seeds are the product of sexual reproduction which produces a remixing of genetic material and phenotype variability on which natural selection acts. Plant seeds hold endophytic microorganisms that can perform various functions, the most important of which is protection against disease.\nEmbryo nourishment.\nSeeds protect and nourish the embryo or young plant. They usually give a seedling a faster start than a sporeling from a spore, because of the larger food reserves in the seed and the multicellularity of the enclosed embryo.\nDispersal.\nUnlike animals, plants are limited in their ability to seek out favorable conditions for life and growth. As a result, plants have evolved many ways to disperse their offspring by dispersing their seeds (see also vegetative reproduction). A seed must somehow \"arrive\" at a location and be there at a time favorable for germination and growth. When the fruits open and release their seeds in a regular way, it is called dehiscent, which is often distinctive for related groups of plants; these fruits include capsules, follicles, legumes, silicles and siliques. When fruits do not open and release their seeds in a regular fashion, they are called indehiscent, which include the fruits achenes, caryopses, nuts, samaras, and utricles.\nBy wind (anemochory).\nOther seeds are enclosed in fruit structures that aid wind dispersal in similar ways:\nBy animals (zoochory).\nMyrmecochory is the dispersal of seeds by ants. Foraging ants disperse seeds which have appendages called elaiosomes (e.g. bloodroot, trilliums, acacias, and many species of Proteaceae). Elaiosomes are soft, fleshy structures that contain nutrients for animals that eat them. The ants carry such seeds back to their nest, where the elaiosomes are eaten. The remainder of the seed, which is hard and inedible to the ants, then germinates either within the nest or at a removal site where the seed has been discarded by the ants. This dispersal relationship is an example of mutualism, since the plants depend upon the ants to disperse seeds, while the ants depend upon the plants seeds for food. As a result, a drop in numbers of one partner can reduce success of the other. In South Africa, the Argentine ant (\"Linepithema humile\") has invaded and displaced native species of ants. Unlike the native ant species, Argentine ants do not collect the seeds of \"Mimetes cucullatus\" or eat the elaiosomes. In areas where these ants have invaded, the numbers of \"Mimetes\" seedlings have dropped.\nDormancy.\nSeed dormancy has two main functions: the first is synchronizing germination with the optimal conditions for survival of the resulting seedling; the second is spreading germination of a batch of seeds over time so a catastrophe (e.g. late frosts, drought, herbivory) does not result in the death of all offspring of a plant (bet-hedging). Seed dormancy is defined as a seed failing to germinate under environmental conditions optimal for germination, normally when the environment is at a suitable temperature with proper soil moisture. This true dormancy or innate dormancy is therefore caused by conditions within the seed that prevent germination. Thus dormancy is a state of the seed, not of the environment. Induced dormancy, enforced dormancy or seed quiescence occurs when a seed fails to germinate because the external environmental conditions are inappropriate for germination, mostly in response to conditions being too dark or light, too cold or hot, or too dry.\nSeed dormancy is not the same as seed persistence in the soil or on the plant, though even in scientific publications dormancy and persistence are often confused or used as synonyms.\nOften, seed dormancy is divided into four major categories: exogenous; endogenous; combinational; and secondary. A more recent system distinguishes five classes: morphological, physiological, morphophysiological, physical, and combinational dormancy.\nExogenous dormancy is caused by conditions outside the embryo, including:\nEndogenous dormancy is caused by conditions within the embryo itself, including:\nThe following types of seed dormancy do not involve seed dormancy, strictly speaking, as lack of germination is prevented by the environment, not by characteristics of the seed itself (see Germination):\nNot all seeds undergo a period of dormancy. Seeds of some mangroves are viviparous; they begin to germinate while still attached to the parent. The large, heavy root allows the seed to penetrate into the ground when it falls. Many garden plant seeds will germinate readily as soon as they have water and are warm enough; though their wild ancestors may have had dormancy, these cultivated plants lack it. After many generations of selective pressure by plant breeders and gardeners, dormancy has been selected out.\nFor annuals, seeds are a way for the species to survive dry or cold seasons. Ephemeral plants are usually annuals that can go from seed to seed in as few as six weeks.\nGermination.\nSeed germination is a process by which a seed embryo develops into a seedling. It involves the reactivation of the metabolic pathways that lead to growth and the emergence of the radicle or seed root and plumule or shoot. The emergence of the seedling above the soil surface is the next phase of the plant's growth and is called seedling establishment.\nThree fundamental conditions must exist before germination can occur. (1) The embryo must be alive, called seed viability. (2) Any dormancy requirements that prevent germination must be overcome. (3) The proper environmental conditions must exist for germination.\nFar red light can prevent germination.\nSeed viability is the ability of the embryo to germinate and is affected by a number of different conditions. Some plants do not produce seeds that have functional complete embryos, or the seed may have no embryo at all, often called empty seeds. Predators and pathogens can damage or kill the seed while it is still in the fruit or after it is dispersed. Environmental conditions like flooding or heat can kill the seed before or during germination. The age of the seed affects its health and germination ability: since the seed has a living embryo, over time cells die and cannot be replaced. Some seeds can live for a long time before germination, while others can only survive for a short period after dispersal before they die.\nSeed vigor is a measure of the quality of seed, and involves the viability of the seed, the germination percentage, germination rate, and the strength of the seedlings produced.\nThe germination percentage is simply the proportion of seeds that germinate from all seeds subject to the right conditions for growth. The germination rate is the length of time it takes for the seeds to germinate. Germination percentages and rates are affected by seed viability, dormancy and environmental effects that impact on the seed and seedling. In agriculture and horticulture quality seeds have high viability, measured by germination percentage plus the rate of germination. This is given as a percent of germination over a certain amount of time, 90% germination in 20 days, for example. 'Dormancy' is covered above; many plants produce seeds with varying degrees of dormancy, and different seeds from the same fruit can have different degrees of dormancy. It's possible to have seeds with no dormancy if they are dispersed right away and do not dry (if the seeds dry they go into physiological dormancy). There is great variation amongst plants and a dormant seed is still a viable seed even though the germination rate might be very low.\nEnvironmental conditions affecting seed germination include; water, oxygen, temperature and light.\nThree distinct phases of seed germination occur: water imbibition; lag phase; and radicle emergence.\nIn order for the seed coat to split, the embryo must imbibe (soak up water), which causes it to swell, splitting the seed coat. However, the nature of the seed coat determines how rapidly water can penetrate and subsequently initiate germination. The rate of imbibition is dependent on the permeability of the seed coat, amount of water in the environment and the area of contact the seed has to the source of water. For some seeds, imbibing too much water too quickly can kill the seed. For some seeds, once water is imbibed the germination process cannot be stopped, and drying then becomes fatal. Other seeds can imbibe and lose water a few times without causing ill effects, but drying can cause secondary dormancy.\nRepair of DNA damage.\nDuring seed dormancy, often associated with unpredictable and stressful environments, DNA damage accumulates as the seeds age. In rye seeds, the reduction of DNA integrity due to damage is associated with loss of seed viability during storage. Upon germination, seeds of \"Vicia faba\" undergo DNA repair. A plant DNA ligase that is involved in repair of single- and double-strand breaks during seed germination is an important determinant of seed longevity. Also, in Arabidopsis seeds, the activities of the DNA repair enzymes Poly ADP ribose polymerases (PARP) are likely needed for successful germination. Thus DNA damages that accumulate during dormancy appear to be a problem for seed survival, and the enzymatic repair of DNA damages during germination appears to be important for seed viability.\nInducing germination.\nA number of different strategies are used by gardeners and horticulturists to break seed dormancy.\nScarification allows water and gases to penetrate into the seed; it includes methods to physically break the hard seed coats or soften them by chemicals, such as soaking in hot water or poking holes in the seed with a pin or rubbing them on sandpaper or cracking with a press or hammer. Sometimes fruits are harvested while the seeds are still immature and the seed coat is not fully developed and sown right away before the seed coat become impermeable. Under natural conditions, seed coats are worn down by rodents chewing on the seed, the seeds rubbing against rocks (seeds are moved by the wind or water currents), by undergoing freezing and thawing of surface water, or passing through an animal's digestive tract. In the latter case, the seed coat protects the seed from digestion, while often weakening the seed coat such that the embryo is ready to sprout when it is deposited, along with a bit of fecal matter that acts as fertilizer, far from the parent plant. Microorganisms are often effective in breaking down hard seed coats and are sometimes used by people as a treatment; the seeds are stored in a moist warm sandy medium for several months under nonsterile conditions.\nStratification, also called moist-chilling, breaks down physiological dormancy, and involves the addition of moisture to the seeds so they absorb water, and they are then subjected to a period of moist chilling to after-ripen the embryo. Sowing in late summer and fall and allowing to overwinter under cool conditions is an effective way to stratify seeds; some seeds respond more favorably to periods of oscillating temperatures which are a part of the natural environment.\nLeaching or the soaking in water removes chemical inhibitors in some seeds that prevent germination. Rain and melting snow naturally accomplish this task. For seeds planted in gardens, running water is best\u00a0\u2013 if soaked in a container, 12 to 24 hours of soaking is sufficient. Soaking longer, especially in stagnant water, can result in oxygen starvation and seed death. Seeds with hard seed coats can be soaked in hot water to break open the impermeable cell layers that prevent water intake.\nOther methods used to assist in the germination of seeds that have dormancy include prechilling, predrying, daily alternation of temperature, light exposure, potassium nitrate, the use of plant growth regulators, such as gibberellins, cytokinins, ethylene, thiourea, sodium hypochlorite, and others. Some seeds germinate best after a fire. For some seeds, fire cracks hard seed coats, while in others, chemical dormancy is broken in reaction to the presence of smoke. Liquid smoke is often used by gardeners to assist in the germination of these species.\nSterile seeds.\nSeeds may be sterile for few reasons: they may have been irradiated, unpollinated, cells lived past expectancy, or bred for the purpose.\nEvolution and origin of seeds.\nThe issue of the origin of seed plants remains unsolved. However, more and more data tends to place this origin in the middle Devonian. The description in 2004 of the proto-seed \"Runcaria heinzelinii\" in the Givetian of Belgium is an indication of that ancient origin of seed-plants. As with modern ferns, most land plants before this time reproduced by sending into the air spores that would land and become whole new plants.\nTaxonomists have described early \"true\" seeds from the upper Devonian, which probably became the theater of their true first evolutionary radiation. With this radiation came an evolution of seed size, shape, dispersal and eventually the radiation of gymnosperms and angiosperms and monocotyledons and dicotyledons. Seed plants progressively became one of the major elements of nearly all ecosystems.\nTrue to the seed.\nAlso called growing true, refers to plants whose seed will yield the same type of plant as the original plant. Open pollinated plants, which include heirlooms, will almost always grow true to seed if another variety does not cross-pollinate them.\nSeed microbiome.\nSeeds harbor a diverse microbial community. Most of these microorganisms are transmitted from the seed to the developing seedlings.\nEconomic importance.\nSeed market.\nIn the United States farmers spent $22 billion on seeds in 2018, a 35 percent increase since 2010. DowDuPont and Monsanto account for 72 percent of corn and soybean seed sales in the U.S. with the average price of a bag of GMO corn seed is priced at $270.\nSeed production.\nSeed production in natural plant populations varies widely from year to year in response to weather variables, insects and diseases, and internal cycles within the plants themselves. Over a 20-year period, for example, forests composed of loblolly pine and shortleaf pine produced from 0 to nearly 5.5 million sound pine seeds per hectare. Over this period, there were six bumper, five poor, and nine good seed crops, when evaluated for production of adequate seedlings for natural forest reproduction.\nEdible seeds.\nMany seeds are edible and the majority of human calories comes from seeds, especially from cereals, legumes and nuts. Seeds also provide most cooking oils, many beverages and spices and some important food additives. In different seeds the seed embryo or the endosperm dominates and provides most of the nutrients. The storage proteins of the embryo and endosperm differ in their amino acid content and physical properties. For example, the gluten of wheat, important in providing the elastic property to bread dough is strictly an endosperm protein.\nSeeds are used to propagate many crops such as cereals, legumes, forest trees, turfgrasses, and pasture grasses. Particularly in developing countries, a major constraint faced is the inadequacy of the marketing channels to get the seed to poor farmers. Thus the use of farmer-retained seed remains quite common.\nSeeds are also eaten by animals (seed predation), and are also fed to livestock or provided as birdseed.\nPoison and food safety.\nWhile some seeds are edible, others are harmful, poisonous or deadly. Plants and seeds often contain chemical compounds to discourage herbivores and seed predators. In some cases, these compounds simply taste bad (such as in mustard), but other compounds are toxic or break down into toxic compounds within the digestive system. Children, being smaller than adults, are more susceptible to poisoning by plants and seeds.\nA deadly poison, ricin, comes from seeds of the castor bean. Reported lethal doses are anywhere from two to eight seeds,\nthough only a few deaths have been reported when castor beans have been ingested by animals.\nIn addition, seeds containing amygdalin\u00a0\u2013 apple, apricot, bitter almond, peach, plum, cherry, quince, and others\u00a0\u2013 when consumed in sufficient amounts, may cause cyanide poisoning.\nOther seeds that contain poisons include annona, cotton, custard apple, datura, uncooked durian, golden chain, horse-chestnut, larkspur, locoweed, lychee, nectarine, rambutan, rosary pea, sour sop, sugar apple, wisteria, and yew. The seeds of the strychnine tree are also poisonous, containing the poison strychnine.\nThe seeds of many legumes, including the common bean (\"Phaseolus vulgaris\"), contain proteins called lectins which can cause gastric distress if the beans are eaten without cooking. The common bean and many others, including the soybean, also contain trypsin inhibitors which interfere with the action of the digestive enzyme trypsin. Normal cooking processes degrade lectins and trypsin inhibitors to harmless forms.\nOther uses.\nCotton fiber grows attached to cotton plant seeds. Other seed fibers are from kapok and milkweed.\nMany important nonfood oils are extracted from seeds. Linseed oil is used in paints. Oil from jojoba and crambe are similar to whale oil.\nSeeds are the source of some medicines including castor oil, tea tree oil and the quack cancer drug Laetrile.\nMany seeds have been used as beads in necklaces and rosaries including Job's tears, Chinaberry, rosary pea, and castor bean. However, the latter three are also poisonous.\nOther seed uses include:\nIn religion.\nThe Book of Genesis in the Old Testament begins with an explanation of how all plant forms began:\nAnd God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so. And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after its kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after its kind: and God saw that it was good. And the evening and the morning were the third day.\nThe Quran speaks of seed germination thus:\nIt is Allah Who causeth the seed-grain and the date-stone to split and sprout. He causeth the living to issue from the dead, and He is the one to cause the dead to issue from the living. That is Allah: then how are ye deluded away from the truth?\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Each of its countries has a different national history, but East Asian Studies scholars maintain that the region is also characterized by a distinct pattern of historical development. This is evident in the relationships among traditional East Asian civilizations, which not only involve the sum total of historical patterns but also a specific set of patterns that has affected all or most of traditional East Asia in successive layers.\nBackground.\nField of study and scope.\nThe study of East Asian history is a part of the rise of East Asian studies as an academic field in the Western world. The teaching and studying of East Asian history began in the West during the late 19th century. In the United States, Asian Americans around the time of the Vietnam War believed that most history courses were Eurocentric and advocated for an Asian-based curriculum. At the present time, East Asian History remains a major field within Asian Studies. Nationalist historians in the region tend to stress the uniqueness of their respective country's tradition, culture, and history because it helps them legitimize their claim over territories and minimize internal disputes. There is also the case of individual authors influenced by different concepts of society and development, which lead to conflicting accounts. These, among other factors, led some scholars to stress the need for broader regional and historical frameworks. There have been issues with defining exact parameters for what East Asian history which as an academic study has focused on East Asia's interactions with other regions of the world. Scholars such as Andrew Abalahin have argued that East Asia and its neighboring region of Southeast Asia form a single ethno-cultural area, sharing common roots and history with each other, while being distinct from other world regions. Historian Charles Holcombe states that East Asia as a unified cultural region can be defined by adherence to Confucianism, influences from Buddhism and a usage of chopsticks. Nomadic Peoples to China's north including Turkic, Manchu and Mongolian tribes were sinicized over time, this assimilation often occurred as a result of nomadic conquest of China rather than Chinese conquest of the steppe.\nSummary of history.\nRecorded civilization dates to approximately 2000\u00a0BC in China's Shang dynasty along the Yellow River Valley, though the historically disputed Xia dynasty is said to have existed even earlier. Civilization expanded to other areas in East Asia gradually. In Korea Gojoseon became the first organized state around approximately 195\u00a0BC. Japan emerged as a unitary state with the creation of its first constitution in 604\u00a0AD. The introduction of Buddhism and the Silk Road were instrumental in building East Asia's culture and economy.\nChinese dynasties such as the Sui, Tang and Song interacted with and influenced the characters of early Japan and Korea. At the turn of the first millennium\u00a0AD, China was the most advanced civilization in East Asia and was responsible for the Four Great Inventions. China's GDP was likely the largest in the world at times as well.\nThe rise of the nomadic Mongol Empire disrupted East Asia, and under the leadership of leaders such as Genghis Khan, Subutai, and Kublai Khan brought the majority of East Asia under rule of a single state, with the exception of Japan and Taiwan. The Yuan dynasty attempted and failed to conquer Japan in two separate maritime invasions. The Mongol era in East Asia was short-lived due to natural disasters and poor administrative management. In the aftermath of the Yuan dynasty's collapse, new regimes such as the Ming dynasty and Joseon dynasty embraced Neo-Confucianism as the official state ideology. Japan at this time fell into feudal civil war known as the \"Sengoku Jidai\" which persisted for over a century and a half. At the turn of the 16th century European merchants and missionaries traveled to East Asia by sea for the first time. The Portuguese established a colony in Macau, China and attempted to Christianize Japan. In the last years of the Sengoku period, Japan attempted to create a larger empire by invading Korea only being defeated by the combined forces of Korea and China in the late 16th century.\nFrom the 17th century onward, East Asian nations such as China, Japan, and Korea chose a policy of isolationism in response to European contact. The 17th and 18th centuries saw great economic and cultural growth. Qing China dominated the region but Edo Japan remained completely independent. At this time limited interactions with European merchants and intellectuals led to the rise of Great Britain's East India Company and the beginning of Japan's Dutch studies. However, 1800s saw the rise of European imperialism in the region. Qing China was unable to defend itself from various colonial expeditions from Great Britain, France, and Russia during the Opium Wars. Japan meanwhile choose the path of westernization under the Meiji period and attempted to modernize by following the political and economic models of Europe and the Western World. The rising Japanese Empire forcibly annexed Korea in 1910. After years of civil war and decline, China's last emperor Puyi abdicated in 1912 ending China's imperial history which had persisted for over two millennia from the Qin to Qing.\nIn the midst of the Republic of China's attempts to build a modern state, Japanese expansionism pressed onward in the first half of the twentieth century, culminating in the brutal Second Sino-Japanese War where over twenty million people died during Japan's invasion of China. Japan's wars in Asia became a part of WWII after Japan's attack of the United States' Pearl Harbor. Japan's defeat in Asia by the hand of the allies contributed to the creation of a new world order under American and Soviet influence across the world. Afterwards, East Asia was caught in the cross hairs of the Cold War. The People's Republic of China initially fell under the sphere of the Soviet camp but Japan under American occupation was solidly tied to Western nations. Japan's recovery became known as the post-war economic miracle. Soviet and Western competition led to the Korean War, which created two separate states that exist in present times.\nThe end of the Cold War and the rise of globalization have brought South Korea, and the People's Republic of China into the world economy. Since 1980, the economies and living standards of South Korea and China have increased exponentially. In contemporary times, East Asia is a pivotal world region with a major influence on world events. In 2010, East Asia's population made up approximately 24% of the world's population.\nPrehistory.\nHomo erectus (\"upright man\") is believed to have lived in East Asia from 1.8 million to 40,000 years ago.\nIn China specifically, fossils representing 40 \"Homo erectus\" individuals, known as Peking Man, were found near Beijing at Zhoukoudian that date to about 400,000 years ago. The species was believed to have lived for at least several hundred thousand years in China, and possibly until 200,000 years ago in Indonesia. They may have been the first to use fire and cook food. Homo sapiens migrated into inland Asia, likely by following herds of bison and mammoth and arrived in southern Siberia by about 43,000 years ago and some people moved south or east from there.\nThe earliest sites of Neolithic culture include Nanzhuangtou culture around 9500 BC to 9000 BC, Pengtoushan culture around 7500 BC to 6100 BC, Peiligang culture around 7000 BC to 5000 BC. China's first villages appeared on the landscape at this time.\nIn Korea the Jeulmun pottery period is sometimes labeled the \"Korean Neolithic\", but since intensive agriculture and evidence of European-style 'Neolithic' lifestyle is sparse at best, such terminology is misleading. The Jeulmun was a period of hunting, gathering, and small-scale cultivation of plants from 20,000 BC to 8000 BC. Archaeologists sometimes refer to this life-style pattern as 'broad-spectrum hunting-and-gathering'.\nThe J\u014dmon period occurred in Japan from circa 14,000 BC to 300BC, with some characteristics of both Neolithic and Mesolithic culture.\nAncient East Asia (4,000 BC- 1,000 AD).\nAncient Chinese dynasties.\nThe Xia dynasty of China (from c. 2100 to c. 1600 BC) is the first dynasty to be described in ancient historical records such as Sima Qian's \"Records of the Grand Historian\" and \"Bamboo Annals\".\nFollowing this was the Shang dynasty, which ruled in the Yellow River valley. The classic account of the Shang comes from texts such as the \"Book of Documents\", \"Bamboo Annals\" and \"Records of the Grand Historian\". According to the traditional chronology, the Shang ruled from 1766 BC to 1122 BC, but according to the chronology based upon the \"current text\" of \"Bamboo Annals\", they ruled from 1556 BC to 1046 BC.\nThe Zhou dynasty of c.\u20091046\u2013256 BC lasted longer than any other dynasty in Chinese history. However, the actual political and military control of China by the dynasty, surnamed Ji (), lasted only until 771 BC, a period known as the Western Zhou. This period of Chinese history produced what many consider the zenith of Chinese bronze-ware making. The dynasty also spans the period in which the written script evolved into its modern form with the use of an archaic clerical script that emerged during the late Warring States period.\nNomads on the Mongolian Steppe.\nThe territories of modern-day Mongolia and Inner Mongolia in ancient times was inhabited by nomadic tribes. The cultures and languages in these areas were fluid and changed frequently. The use of horses to herd and move started during the Iron Age. A large area of Mongolia was under the influence of Turkic peoples, while the southwestern part of Mongolia was mostly under the influence of Indo-European peoples such as the Tocharians and Scythian tribes. In antiquity, the eastern portions of both Mongolia and Inner Mongolia were inhabited by Mongolic peoples descended from the Donghu people and numerous other tribes These were Tengriist horse-riding pastoralist kingdoms that had close contact with the agrarian Chinese. As a nomadic confederation composed of various clans the Donghu were prosperous in the 4th century BC, forcing surrounding tribes to pay tribute and constantly harassing the Chinese State of Zhao (325 BC, during the early years of the reign of Wuling). To appease the nomads local Chinese rulers often gave important hostages and arranged marriages. In 208 BC Xiongnu emperor Modu Chanyu, in his first major military campaign, defeated the Donghu, who split into the new tribes Xianbei and Wuhuan. The Xiongnu were the largest nomadic enemies of the Han dynasty fighting wars for over three centuries with the Han dynasty before dissolving. Afterwards the Xianbei returned to rule the Steppe north of the Great Wall. The titles of Khangan and Khan originated from the Xianbei.\nAncient Korea.\nAccording to the \"Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms\", Gojoseon was established in 2333 BC by Dangun, who was said to be the offspring of a heavenly prince and a bear-woman. Gojoseon fostered an independent culture in Liaoning and along the Taedong River. In 108 BC, the Chinese Han dynasty under Emperor Wu invaded and conquered Gojoseon. The Han established four commanderies to administer the former Gojoseon territory. After the fragmentation of the Han Empire during the 3rd century and the subsequent chaotic 4th century, the area was lost from the Chinese was reconquered by the Empire of Goguryeo in 313 AD.\nIn 58 BC, the Korean Peninsula was divided into three kingdoms, Baekje, Silla and Goguryeo. Although they shared a similar language and culture, these three kingdoms constantly fought with each other for control of the peninsula. Furthermore, Goguryeo had been engaged in constant wars with the Chinese. This included the Goguryeo\u2013Sui War, where the Kingdom of Goguryeo managed to repel the invading forces of the Sui dynasty.\nAs the Kingdom of Silla conquered nearby city-states, they gained access to the Yellow Sea, making direct contact with the Tang dynasty possible. The Tang dynasty teamed up with Silla and formed a strategy to invade Goguryeo. Since Goguryeo had been able to repel earlier Chinese invasions from the North, perhaps Gorguryeo would fall if it were attacked by Silla from the south at the same time. However, in order to do this, the Tang-Silla alliance had to eliminate Goguryeo's nominal ally Baekje and secure a base of operations in southern Korea for a second front. In 660, the coalition troops of Silla and Tang of China attacked Baekje, resulting in the annexation of Baekje by Silla. Together, Silla and Tang effectively eliminated Baekje when they captured the capital of Sabi, as well as Baekje's last king, Uija, and most of the royal family.\nHowever, Yamato Japan and Baekje had been long-standing and very close allies. In 663, Baekje revival forces and a Japanese naval fleet convened in southern Baekje to confront the Silla forces in the Battle of Baekgang. The Tang dynasty also sent 7,000 soldiers and 170 ships. After five naval confrontations that took place in August 663 at Baekgang, considered the lower reaches of Tongjin river, the Silla\u2013Tang forces emerged victorious.\nThe Silla\u2013Tang forces turned their attention to Goguryeo. Although Goguryeo had repelled the Sui dynasty a century earlier, attacks by the Tang dynasty from the west proved too formidable. The Silla\u2013Tang alliance emerged victorious in the Goguryeo\u2013Tang War. Silla thus unified most of the Korean Peninsula in 668. The kingdom's reliance on China's Tang dynasty had its price. Silla had to forcibly resist the imposition of Chinese rule over the entire peninsula. Silla then fought for nearly a decade to expel Chinese forces to finally establish a unified kingdom as far north as modern Pyongyang.\nEarly Japan.\nJapan was inhabited more than 30,000 years ago, when land bridges connected Japan to Korea and China to the south and Siberia to the north. With rising sea levels, the 4 major islands took form around 20,000 years ago, and the lands connecting today's Japan to the continental Asia completely disappeared 15,000 to 10,000 years ago. Thereafter, some migrations continued by way of the Korean peninsula, which would serve as Japan's main avenue for cultural exchange with the continental Asia until the medieval period. The mythology of ancient Japan is contained within the Kojiki ('Records of Ancient Matters') which describes the creation myth of Japan and its lineage of Emperors to the Sun Goddess Amaterasu.\nAncient pottery has been uncovered in Japan, particularly in Kyushu, that points to two major periods: the J\u014dmon (c. 7,500\u2013250 BC, \u7e04\u6587\u6642\u4ee3 \"J\u014dmon Jidai\" ) and the Yayoi (c. 250 BC \u2013 250 AD, \u5f25\u751f\u6642\u4ee3 \"Yayoi Jidai\"). \"J\u014dmon\" can be translated as 'cord marks' and refers to the pattern on the pottery of the time; this style was more ornate than the later Yayoi type, which has been found at more widespread sites (e.g. around Tokyo) and seems to have been developed for more practical purposes.\nBirth of Confucianism and Taoism.\nConfucianism and Taoism originated in the Spring and Autumn period, arising from the historic figures of Confucius and Laozi. They have functioned has both competing and complementary belief systems. Confucianism emphasizes social order and filial piety while Taoism emphasizes the universal force of the Tao and spiritual well-being.\nConfucianism is an ethical and philosophical system that developed during the Spring and Autumn period. It later developed metaphysical and cosmological elements in the Han dynasty. Following the official abandonment of Legalism in China after the Qin dynasty, Confucianism became the official state ideology of the Han. Nonetheless, from the Han period onwards, most Chinese emperors have used a mix of Legalism and Confucianism as their ruling doctrine. The disintegration of the Han in the second century CE opened the way for the soteriological doctrines of Buddhism and Taoism to dominate intellectual life at that time.\nA Confucian revival began during the Tang dynasty. In the late Tang, Confucianism developed aspects on the model of Buddhism and Taoism that gradually evolved into what is now known as Neo-Confucianism. This reinvigorated form was adopted as the basis of the imperial exams and the core philosophy of the scholar-official class in the Song dynasty. Confucianism would reign supreme as an ideology influencing all of East Asia until the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1911.\nTaoism as a movement originates from the semi mystical figure of Laozi, who allegedly lived during the 6th\u20135th century BC. His teachings revolved around personal serenity, balance in the universe and the life source of the Tao. The first organized form of Taoism, the Tianshi (Celestial Masters') school (later known as Zhengyi school), developed from the Five Pecks of Rice movement at the end of the 2nd century CE; the latter had been founded by Zhang Daoling, who claimed that Laozi appeared to him in the year 142. The Tianshi school was officially recognized by ruler Cao Cao in 215, legitimizing Cao Cao's rise to power in return. Laozi received imperial recognition as a divinity in the mid-2nd century BCE.\nTaoism, in form of the Shangqing School, gained official status in China again during the Tang dynasty (618\u2013907), whose emperors claimed Laozi as their relative. The Shangqing movement, however, had developed much earlier, in the 4th century, on the basis of a series of revelations by gods and spirits to a certain Yang Xi in the years between 364 and 370.\nQin and Han dynasties.\nIn 221 BC, the state of Qin succeeded in conquering the other six states, creating the first imperial dynasty of China. Following the death of the emperor Qin Shi Huang, the Qin dynasty collapsed and control was taken over by the Han dynasty in 206 BC. In 220 AD, the Han empire collapsed into the Three Kingdoms. The series of trade routes known as Silk Road began during the Han dynasty.\nQin Shi Huang ruled the unified China directly with absolute power. In contrast to the decentralized and feudal rule of earlier dynasties the Qin set up a number of 'commanderies' around the country which answered directly to the emperor. Nationwide the political philosophy of Legalism was used as a means of the statecraft and writings promoting rival ideas such as Confucianism were prohibited or controlled. In his reign Qin created the first continuous Great Wall with the use of forced labor and Invasions were launched southward to annex Northern Vietnam. Eventually, rebels rose against the Qin's brutal reign and fought civil wars for control of China. Ultimately the Han dynasty arose and ruled China for over four centuries in what accounted for a long period in prosperity, with a brief interruption by the Xin dynasty. The Han dynasty fought constant wars with nomadic Xiongnu for centuries before finally dissolving the tribe.\nThe Han dynasty played a great role in developing the Silk Road which would transfer wealth and ideas across Eurasia for millennia, and also invented paper. Though the Han enjoyed great military and economic success it was strained by the rise of aristocrats who disobeyed the central government. Public frustration provoked the Yellow Turban Rebellion \u2013 though a failure it nonetheless accelerated the empire's downfall. After 208 AD the Han dynasty broke up into rival kingdoms. China would remain divided until 581 under the Sui dynasty, during the era of division Buddhism would be introduced to China for the first time.\nEra of disunion in China.\nThe Three Kingdoms period consisted of the kingdom of Wei, Shu, and Wu. It began when the ruler of Wei, Cao Cao, was defeated by Liu Bei and Sun Quan at the Battle of Red Cliffs. After Cao Cao's death in AD 220, his son Cao Pi became emperor of Wei. Liu Bei and Sun Quan declared themselves emperor of Shu and Wu respectively. Many famous personages in Chinese history were born during this period, including Hua Tuo and the great military strategist Zhuge Liang. Buddhism, which was introduced during the Han dynasty, also became popular in this period. Two years after Wei conquered Shu in AD 263, Sima Yan, Wei's Imperial Chancellor, overthrew Wei and started the Western Jin dynasty. The conquest of Wu by the Western Jin dynasty ended the Three Kingdoms period, and China was unified again. However, the Western Jin did not last long. Following the death of Sima Yan, the War of the Eight Princes began. This war weakened the Jin dynasty, and it soon fell to the kingdom of Han-Zhao. This ushered in the Sixteen Kingdoms.\nThe Northern Wei was established by the Tuoba clan of the Xianbei people in AD 386, when they united the northern part of China. During the Northern Wei, Buddhism flourished, and became an important tool for the emperors of the Northern Wei, since they were believed to be living incarnations of Buddha. Soon, the Northern Wei was divided into the Eastern Wei and Western Wei. These were followed by the Northern Zhou and Northern Qi. In the south, the dynasties were much less stable than the Northern dynasties. The four Southern dynasties were weakened by conflicts between the ruling families.\nSpread of Buddhism.\nBuddhism, also one of the major religions in East Asia, was introduced into China during the Han dynasty from Nepal in the 1st century BC. Buddhism was originally introduced to Korea from China in 372, and eventually arrived in Japan around the turn of the 6th century.\nFor a long time Buddhism remained a foreign religion with a few believers in China. During the Tang dynasty, a fair amount of translations from Sanskrit into Chinese were done by Chinese priests, and Buddhism became one of the major religions of the Chinese along with the other two indigenous religions. In Korea, Buddhism was not seen to conflict with the rites of nature worship; it was allowed to blend in with Shamanism. Thus, the mountains that were believed to be the residence of spirits in pre-Buddhist times became the sites of Buddhist temples. Though Buddhism initially enjoyed wide acceptance, even being supported as the state ideology during the Goguryeo, Silla, Baekje, Balhae, and Goryeo periods, Buddhism in Korea suffered extreme repression during the Joseon dynasty.\nIn Japan, Buddhism and Shinto were combined using the theological theory \"Ry\u014dbushint\u014d\", which says Shinto deities are avatars of various Buddhist entities, including Buddhas and Bodhisattvas (Shinbutsu-sh\u016bg\u014d). This became the mainstream notion of Japanese religion. In fact until the Meiji government declared their separation in the mid-19th century, many Japanese people believed that Buddhism and Shinto were one religion.\nIn Mongolia, Buddhism flourished two times; first in the Mongol Empire (13th\u201314th centuries), and finally in the Qing dynasty (16th\u201319th centuries) from Tibet in the last 2000 years. It was mixed in with Tengeriism and Shamanism.\nSui dynasty.\nIn AD 581, Yang Jian overthrew the Northern Zhou, and established the Sui dynasty. Later, Yang Jian, who became Sui Wendi, conquered the Chen dynasty, and united China. However, this dynasty was short-lived. Sui Wendi's successor, Sui Yangdi, expanded the Grand Canal, and launched four disastrous wars against the Goguryeo. These projects depleted the resources and the workforce of the Sui. In AD 618, Sui Yangdi was murdered. Li Yuan, the former governor of Taiyuan, declared himself the emperor, and founded the Tang dynasty.\nSpread of civil service.\nA government system supported by a large class of Confucian literati selected through civil service examinations was perfected under Tang rule. This competitive procedure was designed to draw the best talents into government. But perhaps an even greater consideration for the Tang rulers, aware that imperial dependence on powerful aristocratic families and warlords would have destabilizing consequences, was to create a body of career officials having no autonomous territorial or functional power base. As it turned out, these scholar-officials acquired status in their local communities, family ties, and shared values that connected them to the imperial court. From Tang times until the closing days of the Qing dynasty in 1911\u20131912, scholar officials often functioned often as between the grassroots level and the government. This model of government had an influence on Japan and Korea.\nMedieval history (1000-1450).\nGoryeo.\nSilla slowly began to decline and the power vacuum this created led to several rebellious states rising up and taking on the old historical names of Korea's ancient kingdoms. Gyeon Hwon, a peasant leader and Silla army officer, taking over the old territory of Baekje and declared himself the king of Hubaekje (\"later Baekje\"). Meanwhile, an aristocratic Buddhist monk leader, Gung Ye, declared a new Goguryeo state in the north, known as Later Goguryeo (Hugoguryo). There then followed a protracted power struggle for control of the peninsula.\nGung Ye began to refer to himself as the Buddha, began to persecute people who expressed their opposition against his religious arguments. He executed many monks, then later even his own wife and two sons, and the public began to turn away from him. His costly rituals and harsh rule caused even more opposition. He also moved the capital in 905, changed the name of his kingdom to Majin in 904 then Taebong in 911. In 918, Gung Ye was deposed by his own generals, and Wang Geon, the previous chief minister was raised to the throne. Gung Ye is said to have escaped the palace, but was killed shortly thereafter either by a soldier or by peasants who mistook him for a thief. Wang Geon, who would posthumously be known by his temple name of Taejo of Goryeo.\nSoon thereafter, the Goryeo dynasty was proclaimed, and Taejo went on to defeat the rivaling Silla and Hubaekje to reunite the three kingdoms in 936. Following the destruction of Balhae by the Khitan Liao dynasty in 927, the last crown prince of Balhae and much of the ruling class sought refuge in Goryeo, where they were warmly welcomed and given land by Taejo. In addition, Taejo included the Balhae crown prince in the Goryeo royal family, unifying the two successor states of Goguryeo and, according to Korean historians, achieving a \"true national unification\" of Korea.\nMongol Empire and Yuan dynasty.\nIn the early 13th century Genghis Khan united warring Mongol tribes into the united Mongol Empire in 1206. The Mongols would proceed to conquer the majority of modern East Asia. Meanwhile, China were divided into five competing states. From 1211, Mongol forces invaded North China. In 1227 the Mongol Empire conquered Western Xia. In 1234, Ogedei Khan extinguished the Jin dynasty.\nThe northern part of China was annexed by Mongol Empire. In 1231, the Mongols began to invade Korea, and quickly captured all the territory of the Goryeo outside the southernmost tip. The Goryeo royal family retreated to the sea outside the city of Seoul to Ganghwa Island. Goryeo was divided between collaborators and resisters to the invaders. However, at the time, the Goryeo Sannotei on the peninsula resisted until 1275.\nIn the 1250s, the Mongols invaded the last remaining state in southern China \u2013 the Southern Song. The invasion carried on for over thirty years, and likely resulted in millions of casualties. In 1271, Kublai Khan proclaimed the Yuan dynasty of China in the traditional Chinese style. The last remnants of the Song were defeated at sea in 1279. China was unified under the Yuan dynasty. Kublai Khan and his administration shifted to the Central Plains area and embraced Confucianism.\nBy 1275, Goryeo had surrendered to the Yuan dynasty as a vassal. Members of the Goryeo royal family were raised to understand Mongol culture, and intermarried with the Yuan imperial family.\nJapan was seriously threatened by the Yuan forces from the East Asian mainland. In 1274, Kublai Khan appointed Yudu. In order to recruit Marshal Dongdu to command the Yuan forces, Han Bing and the Goryeo army began the first expedition to Japan. The Yuan dynasty invaded Japan in two separate invasions, both of which were disrupted by natural typhoons. These two invasions both occupied the town of Kitakyushu before being swept into the sea. At the time the Yuan dynasty fleet was the largest fleet in the history of the world.\nIn order to cope with the nationwide mobilization of the powerful Yuan army, Japan's economy and military were placed under severe pressure. The Japanese Kamakura Shogunate had difficulty compensating its soldiers who had defended the country, which intensified the contradiction between the domestic warrior groups. The ruling system collapsed in the first half of the 14th century.\nScience and technology.\nGunpowder.\nMost sources credit the discovery of gunpowder to Chinese alchemists in the 9th century searching for an elixir of immortality. The discovery of gunpowder was probably the product of centuries of alchemical experimentation. Saltpetre was known to the Chinese by the mid-1st century AD and there is strong evidence of the use of saltpetre and sulfur in various largely medicine combinations. A Chinese alchemical text from 492 noted that saltpeter gave off a purple flame when ignited, providing for the first time a practical and reliable means of distinguishing it from other inorganic salts, making it possible to evaluate and compare purification techniques. By most accounts, the earliest Arabic and Latin descriptions of the purification of saltpeter do not appear until the 13th century.\nThe first reference to gunpowder is probably a passage in the \"Zhenyuan miaodao yaol\u00fce\", a Taoism text tentatively dated to the mid-9th century:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Some have heated together sulfur, realgar and saltpeter with honey; smoke and flames result, so that their hands and faces have been burnt, and even the whole house where they were working burned down.\nThe earliest surviving recipes for gunpowder can be found in the Chinese military treatise \"Wujing zongyao\" of 1044 AD, which contains three: two for use in incendiary bombs to be thrown by siege engines and one intended as fuel for poison smoke bombs. The formulas in the \"Wujing zongyao\" range from 27 to 50 percent nitrate. Experimenting with different levels of saltpetre content eventually produced bombs, grenades, and land mines, in addition to giving fire arrows a new lease on life. By the end of the 12th century, there were cast iron grenades filled with gunpowder formulations capable of bursting through their metal containers. The 14th century \"Huolongjing\" contains gunpowder recipes with nitrate levels ranging from 12 to 91 percent, six of which approach the theoretical composition for maximal explosive force.\nIn China, the 13th century saw the beginnings of rocketry and the manufacture of the oldest gun still in existence, a descendant of the earlier fire-lance, a gunpowder-fueled flamethrower that could shoot shrapnel along with fire. The \"Huolongjing\" text of the 14th century also describes hollow, gunpowder-packed exploding cannonballs.\nIn the 13th century contemporary documentation shows gunpowder beginning to spread from China by the Mongols to the rest of the world, starting with Europe and the Islamic world. The Arabs acquired knowledge of saltpetre\u00a0\u2013 which they called \"Chinese snow\" ( )\u00a0\u2013 around 1240 and, soon afterward, of gunpowder; they also learned of fireworks (\"Chinese flowers\") and rockets (\"Chinese arrows\"). Persians called saltpeter \"Chinese salt\" or \"salt from Chinese salt marshes\" ( ). Historian Ahmad Y. al-Hassan argues\u00a0\u2013 \"contra\" the general notion\u00a0\u2013 that the Chinese technology passed through Arabic alchemy and chemistry before the 13th century. Gunpowder arrived in India by the mid-14th century, but could have been introduced by the Mongols perhaps as early as the mid-13th century.\nPrinting.\nThe first known movable type system was invented in China around 1040 AD by Pi Sheng (990\u20131051) (spelled Bi Sheng in the Pinyin system). Pi Sheng's type was made of baked clay, as described by the Chinese scholar Shen Kuo (1031\u20131095). The world's first metal-based movable type was invented in Korea in 1234, 210 years before Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press in Germany. Jikji is the world's oldest extant movable metal print book. It was published in Heungdeok Temple in 1377, 78 years prior to Gutenberg's \"42-Line Bible\" printed during the years 1452\u20131455.\nEarly modern history (1450-1750).\nMing dynasty: 1368\u20131644.\nThe Ming period is the only era of later imperial history during which all of China proper was ruled by ethnic Han. All the counties in China had a county government, a Confucian school, and the standard Chinese family system. Typically the dominant local elite consisted of high status families composed of the gentry owners and managers of land and of other forms of wealth, as well as smaller groups that were subject to elite domination and protection. Much attention was paid to genealogy to prove that high status was inherited from generations back. Substantial land holdings were directly managed by the owning families in the early Ming period, but toward the end of the era marketing and ownership were depersonalized by the increased circulation of silver as money, and estate management gravitated into the hands of hired bailiffs. Together with the departure of the most talented youth into the imperial service, the result was direct contacts between the elite and subject groups were disrupted, and romantic images of country life disappeared from the literature. In villages across China elite families participated in the life of the empire by sending their sons into the very high status imperial civil service. Most of the successful sons had a common education in the county and prefectural schools, had been recruited by competitive examination, and were posted to offices that might be anywhere in the empire, including the imperial capital. At first the recommendation of an elite local sponsor was important; increasing the imperial government relied more on merit exams, and thus entry into the national ruling class became more difficult. Downward social mobility into the peasantry was possible for less successful sons; upward mobility from the peasant class was unheard of.\nQing dynasty: 1644\u20131912.\nThe Manchus (a tribe from Manchuria) conquered the Shun dynasty (which was established after the Ming fell due to a peasant rebellion) around 1644\u20131683 in wars that killed perhaps 25 million people. The Manchus ruled it as the Qing dynasty until the early 20th century. Notably, Han men were forced to wear the long queue (or pigtail) as a mark of their inferior status. That said, some Han did achieve high rank in the civil service via the Imperial Examination system. Until the 19th century, Han immigration into Manchuria was forbidden. Chinese had an advanced artistic culture and well-developed science and technology. However, its science and technology stood still after 1700 and in the 21st century very little survives outside museums and remote villages, except in for the ever-popular forms of traditional medicine like acupuncture. In the late Qing era (1900 to 1911), the country was beset by large-scale civil wars, major famines, military defeats by Britain and Japan, regional control by powerful warlords and foreign intervention such as the Boxer Rebellion of 1900. Final collapse came in 1911.\nMilitary success in 18th century.\nThe Ten Great Campaigns of the Qianlong Emperor from the 1750s to the 1790s extended Qing control into Inner Asia. During the peak of the Qing dynasty, the empire ruled over the entirety of today's Mainland China, Hainan, Taiwan, Mongolia, Outer Manchuria and areas outside today's Northwest China.\nMilitary defeats in 19th century.\nDespite its origin in military conquest, and the long warlike tradition of the Manchu people who formed its ruling class, by the 19th century the Qing state was militarily extremely weak, poorly trained, lacking modern weapons and plagued by corruption and incompetence.\nThey repeatedly lost against the Western powers. Two Opium Wars (\u9e26\u7247\u6218\u4e89 y\u0101pi\u00e0n zh\u00e0nzh\u0113ng), pitted China against Western powers, notably Britain and France. China quickly lost both wars. After each defeat, the victors forced the Chinese government to make major concessions. After the first war 1839\u20131842, the treaty ceded Hong Kong island to Britain, and opened five \"treaty ports\" including Shanghai and Guangzhou (Canton), and others of less importance Xiamen, Fuzhou, and Ningbo) to Western trade. After the second, Britain acquired Kowloon (the peninsula opposite Hong Kong island), and inland cities such as Nanjing and Hangkou (now part of Wuhan) were opened to trade.\nDefeat in the Second Opium War, 1856\u20131860, was utterly humiliating for China. The British and French sent ambassadors, escorted by a small army, to Beijing to see the treaty signed. The Emperor, however, did not receive ambassadors in anything like the Western sense; the closest Chinese expression translates as \"tribute-bearer\". To the Chinese court, Western envoys were just a group of new outsiders who should show appropriate respect for the emperor like any other visitors; of course the kowtow (knocking one's head on the floor) was a required part of the protocol. For that matter, the kowtow was required in dealing with any Chinese official. From the viewpoint of Western powers, treating China's decadent medieval regime with any respect at all was being generous. The envoy of Queen Victoria or another power might give some courtesies, even pretend for form's sake that the Emperor was the equal of their own ruler. However, they considered the notion that they should kowtow utterly ludicrous. In fact, it was official policy that no Briton of any rank should kowtow in any circumstances.\nChina engaged in various stalling tactics to avoid actually signing the humiliating treaty to which their envoys had already agreed, and the scandalous possibility of an envoy coming before the Emperor and failing to kowtow. The ambassadors' progress to Beijing was impeded at every step. Several battles were fought, in each of which Chinese forces were soundly thrashed by numerically inferior Western forces. Eventually, Beijing was occupied, the treaty signed and embassies established. The British took the luxurious house of a Manchu general prominent in opposing their advance as their embassy.\nIn retaliation for Chinese torture and murder of captives, including envoys taken while under a flag of truce, British and French forces also utterly destroyed the Yuan Ming Yuan (Old Summer Palace), an enormous complex of gardens and buildings outside Beijing. It took 3500 troops to loot it, wreck it and set it alight, and it burned for three days sending up a column of smoke clearly visible in Beijing. Once the Summer Palace was reduced to ruins a sign was raised with an inscription in Chinese stating \"This is the reward for perfidy and cruelty\". The choice to destroy the palace was quite deliberate; they wanted something quite visible that struck at the upper classes who had ordered the crimes. Like the Forbidden City, no ordinary Chinese citizen had ever been allowed into the Summer Palace, as it was used exclusively by the Imperial family.\nIn 1884\u20131885, China and France fought a war that resulted in China's accepting French control over their former tributary states in what is now Vietnam. The Qing armies acquitted themselves well in campaigns in Guangxi and Taiwan. However, the French sank much of China's modernized Fuzhou-based naval fleet in an afternoon.\nThey also lost repeatedly against Japan, partly because Britain had helped modernise Japanese forces as a counter to Russian influence in the region. In 1879, Japan annexed the Ryukyu Kingdom, then a Chinese tributary state, and incorporated it as Okinawa prefecture. Despite pleas from a Ryukyuan envoy, China was powerless to send an army. The Chinese sought help from the British, who refused to intervene. In 1895, China lost the Sino-Japanese war and ceded Taiwan, the Penghu islands and the Liaodong peninsula to Japan. In addition, it had to relinquish control of Korea, which had been a tributary state of China for a long time.\nRebellions.\nThe Qing also had internal troubles, notably several Muslim rebellions in the West and the Taiping Rebellion in the South, with millions dead and tens of millions more impoverished.\nThe Taiping Rebellion, 1851\u20131864, was led by a charismatic figure claiming to be Christ's younger brother. It was largely a peasant revolt. The Taiping program included land reform and eliminating slavery, concubinage, arranged marriage, opium, footbinding, judicial torture and idolatry. The Qing government, with some Western help, eventually defeated the Taiping rebels, but not before they had ruled much of southern China for over ten years. This was one of the bloodiest wars ever fought; only World War II killed more people.\nThe Chinese resented much during this period \u2014 notably Christian missionaries, opium, annexation of Chinese land and the extraterritoriality that made foreigners immune to Chinese law. To the West, trade and missionaries were obviously good things, and extraterritoriality was necessary to protect their citizens from the corrupt Chinese system. To many Chinese, however, these were yet more examples of the West exploiting China.\nBoxer Rebellion 1898\u20131900.\nAround 1898, these feelings exploded. The Boxers, also known as the \"Society of Righteous and Harmonious Fists\" (\u4e49\u548c\u56e2 y\u00ec h\u00e9 tu\u00e1n) led a peasant religious/political movement whose main goal was to drive out evil foreign influences. Some believed their kung fu and prayer could stop bullets. While initially anti-Qing, once the revolt began they received some support from the Qing court and regional officials. The Boxers killed a few missionaries and many Chinese Christians, and eventually besieged the embassies in Beijing. An eight-nation alliance \u2014 Germany, France, Italy, Russia, Great Britain, the United States, Austria-Hungary and Japan \u2014 sent a force up from Tianjin to rescue the legations. The Qing had to accept foreign troops permanently posted in Beijing and pay a large indemnity as a result. In addition, Shanghai was divided among China and the eight nations.\nLast minute reforms 1898\u20131908.\nThe Hundred Days' Reform was a failed 103-day national, cultural, political, and educational reform movement in 1898. It was undertaken by the young Guangxu Emperor and his reform-minded supporters. Following the issuing of the reformative edicts, a \"coup d'\u00e9tat\" (\"The Coup of 1898\", Wuxu Coup) was perpetrated by powerful conservative opponents led by Empress Dowager Cixi, who became a virtual dictator.\nThe Boxer Rebellion was a humiliating fiasco for China: the Qing rulers proved visibly incompetent and lost prestige irreparably, while the foreign powers gained greater influence in Chinese affairs. The humiliation stimulated a second reform movement\u2014this time sanctioned by the empress dowager Cixi herself. From 1901 to 1908, the dynasty announced a series of educational, military, and administrative reforms, many reminiscent of the \"one hundreds days\" of 1898. In 1905 the examination system itself was abolished and the entire Confucian tradition of merit entry into the elite collapsed. The abolition of the traditional civil service examination was itself a revolution of immense significance. After many centuries, the scholar's mind began to be liberated from the shackles of classical studies, and social mobility no longer depended chiefly on the writing of stereotyped and flowery prose. New ministries were created in Beijing and revised law codes were drafted. Work began on a national budget\u2014the national government had no idea how much taxes were collected in its name and spent by regional officials. New armies were raised and trained in European (and Japanese) fashion and plans for a national army were laid. The creation of the \"new army\" reflected rising esteem for the military profession and the emergence of a new national elite that dominated China for much of the 20th century. . More officers and men were now literate, while patriotism and better pay served as an inducement for service.\nReform and revolution.\nThe movement for constitutionalism gathered momentum following the Russo-Japanese War of 1904\u20131905, for Japan's victory signalled the triumph of constitutionalism over absolutism. Under pressure from gentry and student groups, the Qing court in 1908 issued plans for the inauguration of consultative provincial assemblies in 1909, a consultative national assembly in 1910, and both a constitution and a parliament in 1917. The consultative assemblies were to play a pivotal role in the unfolding events, politicizing the provincial gentry and providing them with new leverage with which to protect their interests.\nIronically, the measures designed to preserve the Qing dynasty hastened its death, for the nationalistic and modernizing impulses generated or nurtured by the reforms brought a greater awareness of the Qing government's extreme backwardness. Modernizing forces emerged as business, students, women, soldiers, and overseas Chinese became mobilized and demanded change. Government-sponsored education in Japan, available to both civilian and military students, exposed Chinese youths to revolutionary ideas produced by political exiles and inspired by the West. Anti-Manchu revolutionary groups were formed in the Yangtze cities by 1903, and those in Tokyo banded together to form the \"Revolutionary Alliance\" in 1905, led by Sun Yat-sen.\nJoseon Korea: 1392\u20131897.\nIn July 1392, General Yi Seong-gye overthrew the Goryeo dynasty and founded a new dynasty, Joseon. As King Taejo of Joseon, he chose Hanyang (Seoul) as the capital of the new dynasty. During its 500-year reign, Joseon encouraged the entrenchment of Confucian ideals and doctrines in Korean society. Neo-Confucianism was installed as the new dynasty's state ideology. Joseon consolidated its effective rule over the territory of current Korea and saw the height of classical Korean culture, trade, literature, and science and technology. Joseon dynasty was a highly centralized monarchy and neo-Confucian bureaucracy as codified by \"Gyeongguk daejeon\", a sort of Joseon constitution. The king had absolute authority, the officials were also expected to persuade the king to the right path if the latter was thought to be mistaken. He was bound by tradition, precedents set by earlier kings, Gyeongguk daejeon, and Confucian teachings. In theory, there were three social classes, but in practice, there were four. The top class were the yangban, or \"scholar-gentry\", the commoners were called sangmin or \"yangmin\", and the lowest class was that of the cheonmin. Between the yangban and the commoners was a fourth class, the chungin, \"middle people\". Joseon Korea installed a centralised administrative system controlled by civil bureaucrats and military officers who were collectively called Yangban. Yangban strove to do well at the royal examinations to obtain high positions in the government. They had to excel in calligraphy, poetry, classical Chinese texts, and Confucian rites. In order to become an official, one had to pass a series of gwageo examinations. There were three kinds of gwageo exams \u2013 literary, military, and miscellaneous.\nEdo Japan.\nIn 1603, the Tokugawa shogunate ushered in a long period of isolation from foreign influence in order to secure its power. For 250 years this policy enabled Japan to enjoy stability and a flowering of its indigenous culture. Early modern Japanese society had an elaborate social structure, in which everyone knew their place and level of prestige. At the top were the emperor and the court nobility, invincible in prestige but weak in power. Next came the \"bushi\" of sh\u014dgun, daimy\u014d and layers of feudal lords whose rank was indicated by their closeness to the Tokugawa. They had power. The \"daimy\u014d\" were about 250 local lords of local \"han\" with annual outputs of 50,000 or more bushels of rice. The upper strata was much given to elaborate and expensive rituals, including elegant architecture, landscaped gardens, n\u014d drama, patronage of the arts, and the tea ceremony.\nThree cultures.\nThree distinct cultural traditions operated during the Tokugawa era, having little to do with each other. In the villages the peasants had their own rituals and localistic traditions. In the high society of the imperial court, daimy\u014d and samurai, Chinese cultural influence was paramount, especially in the areas of ethics and political ideals. Neo-Confucianism became the approved philosophy, and was taught in official schools; Confucian norms regarding personal duty and family honor became deeply implanted in elite thought. Equally pervasive was the Chinese influence in painting, decorative arts and history, economics, and natural science. One exception came in religion, where there was a revival of Shinto, which had originated in Japan. Motoori Norinaga (1730\u20131801) freed Shinto from centuries of Buddhist accretions and gave a new emphasis to the myth of imperial divine descent, which later became a political tool for imperialist conquest until it was destroyed in 1945. The third cultural level was the popular art of the low-status artisans, merchants and entertainers, especially in Edo and other cities. It revolved around \"ukiyo\", the floating world of the city pleasure quarters and theaters that was officially off-limits to samurai. Its actors and courtesans were favorite subjects of the woodblock color prints that reached high levels of technical and artistic achievement in the 18th century. They also appeared in the novels and short stories of popular prose writers of the age like Ihara Saikaku (1642\u20131693). The theater itself, both in the puppet drama and the newer kabuki, as written by the greatest dramatist, Chikamatsu Monzaemon (1653\u20131724), relied on the clash between duty and inclination in the context of revenge and love.\nGrowth of Edo/Tokyo.\nEdo (Tokyo) had been a small settlement for 400 years but began to grow rapidly after 1603 when Sh\u014dgun Ieyasu built a fortified city as the administrative center of the new Tokugawa Shogunate. Edo resembled the capital cities of Europe with military, political, and economic functions. The Tokugawa political system rested on both feudal and bureaucratic controls, so that Edo lacked a unitary administration. The typical urban social order was composed of samurai, unskilled workers and servants, artisans, and businessmen. The artisans and businessmen were organized in officially sanctioned guilds; their numbers grew rapidly as Tokyo grew and became a national trading center. Businessmen were excluded from government office, and in response they created their own subculture of entertainment, making Edo a cultural as well as a political and economic center. With the Meiji Restoration, Tokyo's political, economic, and cultural functions simply continued as the new capital of imperial Japan.\nWestern colonialism (1750-1919).\nThe Meiji Era.\nFollowing the Treaty of Kanagawa with the United States of America in 1854, Japan opened its ports and began to intensively modernise and industrialise. The Meiji Restoration of 1868 ended the Tokugawa period, and put Japan on a course of centralized modern government in the name of the Emperor. During late nineteenth and early twentieth century, Japan became a regional power that was able to defeat the militaries of both China and Russia. It occupied Korea, Formosa (Taiwan), and southern Sakhalin Island.\nEarly 20th century (1900-1950).\nPacific War.\nIn 1931, Japan occupied Manchuria (\"Dongbei\") after the Manchurian Incident, and in 1937 it launched a full-scale invasion of China. The U.S. undertook large scale military and economic aid to China and demanded Japanese withdrawal. Instead of withdrawing, Japan invaded French Indochina in 1940\u201341. In response, the U.S., Britain and the Netherlands cut off oil imports in 1941, which accounted for over 90% of Japan's oil supply. Negotiations with the US led nowhere. Japan attacked U.S. forces at the Battle of Pearl Harbor in December 1941, triggering America's entry into World War II. Japan rapidly expanded at sea and land, capturing Singapore and the Philippines in early 1942, and threatening India and Australia.\nAlthough it was to be a long and bloody war, Japan began to lose the initiative in 1942. At the Battle of the Coral Sea, a Japanese offensive was turned back, for the first time, at sea. The June Battle of Midway cost Japan four of its six large aircraft carriers and destroyed its capability for future major offensives. In the Guadalcanal campaign, the U.S. took back ground from Japan.\nU.S. occupation of Japan.\nAfter its defeat in World War II, Japan was occupied by the U.S. until 1951, and recovered from the effects of the war to become an economic power, staunch American ally and a liberal democracy. While Emperor Hirohito was allowed to retain his throne as a symbol of national unity, actual power rests in networks of powerful politicians, bureaucrats, and business executives.\nContemporary era.\nCold War.\nThe Japanese growth in the postwar period was often called a \"miracle\". It was led by manufacturing; starting with textiles and clothing and moving to high-technology, especially automobiles, electronics and computers. The economy experienced a major slowdown starting in the 1990s following three decades of unprecedented growth, but Japan still remains a major global economic power.\nThe Chinese Civil War resumed after World War II concluded. In 1949, Mao Zedong proclaimed the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China, which had governed mainland China until this point, retreated to Taiwan. Since then, the jurisdiction of the Republic of China has been limited to the Taiwan Area.\nAfter the surrender of Japan, at the end of World War II, on 15 August (officially 2 September) 1945, Korea was divided at the 38th parallel into two zones of occupation. The Soviets administered the northern-half and the Americans administered the southern-half. In 1948, as a result of Cold War tensions, the occupation zones became two sovereign states. This led to the establishment of the Republic of Korea in South Korea on 15 August 1948, promptly followed by the establishment of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in North Korea on 9 September 1948. In 1950, after years of mutual hostilities, North Korea invaded South Korea in an attempt to re-unify the peninsula under its communist rule. The united Nations, under the leadership of the United States, back, and China entered to protect North Korea. The Korean War, which lasted from 1950 to 1953, ended with a stalemate and has left the two Koreas separated by the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) up to the present day.\nDecline of religion.\nHistorically, cultures and regions strongly influenced by Confucianism include Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Japan, North Korea, and South Korea, as well as territories settled predominantly by Overseas Chinese, such as Singapore. The abolition of the examination system in 1905 marked the end of official Confucianism. The New culture intellectuals of the early twentieth century blamed Confucianism for China's weaknesses. They searched for new doctrines to replace Confucianism, some of these new ideologies include the \"Three Principles of the People\" with the establishment of the Republic of China, and then Maoism under the People's Republic of China.\nIn Japan, the presence of a liberal order and consumerism led to a voluntarily decline of religious belief.\nAround the turn of the 21st century there were talks of a \"Confucian Revival\" in the academia and the scholarly community. Across the region cultural institutions of religions have remained, even while actual belief has declined.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nScholarly journals.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The division into Ancient-Medieval-Modern periods overlooks the fact that the Muslim conquests occurred gradually during which time many things came and went off, while the south was never completely conquered.

{"id": "37702", "revid": "20957809", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37702", "title": "History of Southeast Asia", "text": "The history of Southeast Asia covers the people of Southeast Asia from prehistory to the present in two distinct sub-regions: Mainland Southeast Asia (or Indochina) and Maritime Southeast Asia (or Insular Southeast Asia). Mainland Southeast Asia comprises Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar (or Burma), Peninsular Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam whereas Maritime Southeast Asia comprises Brunei, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Christmas Island, East Malaysia, East Timor, Indonesia, Philippines and Singapore.\nThe earliest \"Homo sapiens\" presence in Mainland Southeast Asia can be traced back to 70,000 years ago and to at least 50,000 years ago in Maritime Southeast Asia. Since 25,000 years ago, East Asian-related (basal East Asian) groups expanded southwards into Maritime Southeast Asia from Mainland Southeast Asia. As early as 10,000 years ago, Hoabinhian settlers from Mainland Southeast Asia had developed a tradition and culture of distinct artefact and tool production. During the Neolithic, Austroasiatic peoples populated Mainland Southeast Asia via land routes, and sea-borne Austronesian immigrants preferably settled in Maritime Southeast Asia. The earliest agricultural societies that cultivated millet and wet-rice emerged around 1700 BCE in the lowlands and river floodplains of Southeast Asia.\nThe Phung Nguyen culture (modern northern Vietnam) and the Ban Chiang site (modern Thailand) account for the earliest use of copper by around 2,000 BCE, followed by the Dong Son culture, which by around 500 BCE had developed a highly sophisticated industry of bronze production and processing. Around the same time, the first Agrarian Kingdoms emerged where territory was abundant and favourable, such as Funan at the lower Mekong and Van Lang in the Red River Delta. Smaller and insular principalities increasingly engaged in and contributed to the rapidly expanding sea trade.\nThe wide topographical diversity of Southeast Asia has greatly influenced its history. For instance, Mainland Southeast Asia with its continuous but rugged and difficult terrain provided the basis for the early Cham, Khmer, and Mon civilisations. The sub-region's extensive coastline and major river systems of the Irrawaddy, Salween, Chao Phraya, Mekong and Red River have directed socio-cultural and economic activities towards the Indian Ocean and South China Sea.\nIn Maritime Southeast Asia, apart from exceptions such as Borneo and Sumatra, the patchwork of recurring land-sea patterns on widely dispersed islands and archipelagos admitted moderately sized thalassocratic states indifferent to territorial ambitions, where growth and prosperity were associated with sea trade. Since around 100 BCE, Maritime Southeast Asia has occupied a central position at the crossroads of the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea trading routes, immensely stimulating its economy and influencing its culture and society. Most local trading polities selectively adopted Indian Hindu elements of statecraft, religion, culture and administration during the early centuries of the common era, which marked the beginning of recorded history in the area and the continuation of a characteristic cultural development. Chinese culture diffused into the region more indirectly and sporadically, as trade was mostly based on land routes like the Silk Road. Long periods of Chinese isolationism and political relations that were confined to ritualistic tribute procedures prevented deep acculturation.\nBuddhism, particularly in Mainland Southeast Asia, began to affect political structures beginning in the 8th to 9th centuries CE. Islamic ideas arrived in insular Southeast Asia as early as the 8th century, and the first Muslim societies in the area emerged by the 13th century. The era of European colonialism, early Modernity and the Cold War era revealed the reality of limited political significance for the various Southeast Asian polities. Post-World War II national survival and progress required a modern state and a strong national identity. Most modern Southeast Asian countries enjoy a historically unprecedented degree of political freedom and self-determination and have embraced the practical concept of intergovernmental co-operation within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).\nName.\nThough there are numerous ancient historic Asian designations for Southeast Asia, none are geographically consistent with each other. Names referring to Southeast Asia include \"Suvarnabhumi\" or \"Sovannah Phoum\" (\"Golden Land\") and \"Suvarnadvipa\" (\"Golden Islands\") in Indian tradition, the \"Lands below the Winds\" in Arabia and Persia, \"Nanyang\" (Chinese: \u5357\u6d0b; lit.\u2009'South Ocean') in China and \"Nan'y\u014d\" (\u5357\u6d0b) in Japan. A 2nd-century world map created by Ptolemy of Alexandria names the Malay Peninsula as \"Chersonesus Aurea\" (lit.\u2009'Golden Peninsula').\nThe term \"Southeast Asia\" was first used in 1839 by American pastor Howard Malcolm in his book \"Travels in South-Eastern Asia\". Malcolm only included the Mainland section and excluded the Maritime section in his definition of Southeast Asia. The term was officially used to designate the area of operation (the South East Asia Command, SEAC) for Anglo-American forces in the Pacific Theater of World War II from 1941 to 1945.\nPrehistory.\nPaleolithic.\nThe region was already inhabited by \"Homo erectus\" from approximately 1,500,000 years ago during the Middle Pleistocene age. Data analysis of stone tool assemblages and fossil discoveries from Indonesia, Southern China, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and more recently Cambodia and Malaysia has established \"Homo erectus\" migration routes and episodes of presence as early as 120,000 years ago, with even older isolated finds dating back to 1.8 million years ago. Java Man (\"Homo erectus erectus\") and \"Homo floresiensis\" both discovered on Indonesia's islands, attest to a sustained regional presence and isolation, long enough for notable diversification of the species' specifics. Rock art (parietal art) dating from 40,000 to 60,000 years ago (which is currently the world's oldest) has been discovered in the caves of Sulawesi and Borneo (Kalimantan). \"Homo floresiensis\" also lived in the area up until at least 50,000 years ago, after which they became extinct. Modern \"Homo sapiens\" groups, ancestral to Ancient East Eurasians (Eastern non-Africans), including East Asians (Onge and Tianyuan related) populations, and Oceanian (Papuan-related) populations, reached the region by 50,000BCE to 70,000BCE, with some arguing earlier. These immigrants might have, to some extent, merged and reproduced with members of the archaic population of \"Homo erectus\", as the fossil discoveries in the Tam Pa Ling Cave suggest. During much of this time the present-day islands of western Indonesia were joined into a single landmass known as Sundaland due to lower sea levels.\nDistinctive East Eurasian (Eastern non-African) ancestry was recently found to have originated in Mainland Southeast Asia at ~50,000 BCE, and expanded through multiple migration waves southwards and northwards respectively, giving rise to both Oceanian (Papuan-related) and East Asian (Onge and Tianyuan related) lineages.\nAncient remains of hunter-gatherers in Maritime Southeast Asia, such as one Holocene hunter-gatherer from cave of Leang Panninge in South Sulawesi, had ancestry from both the Oceanian lineage (represented by Papuans and Aboriginal Australians), and the basal East Asian lineage (represented by Onge or Tianyuan related ancestry). The hunter-gatherer individual had approximately 50% \"basal East Asian\" ancestry and was positioned in between the Andamanese Onge and the Papuans of Oceania. The authors concluded that the presence of this type of ancestry in the Holocene hunter-gatherer suggests that the expansion of East Asian-related ancestry from Mainland Southeast Asia into Maritime Southeast Asia may have taken place long before the expansion of Austronesian societies.\nGeneflow of East Asian-related ancestry into Maritime Southeast Asia and Oceania is estimated to ~25,000BCE (possibly as early as 50,000BCE). The pre-Neolithic Oceanian-related populations of Maritime Southeast Asia were largely replaced by the expansion of various East Asian populations, beginning about 25,000BCE from Mainland Southeast Asia. East Asian-related ancestry was widespread across Southeast Asia by 15,000BCE, predating the expansion of Austroasiatic and Austronesian peoples.\nOcean drops of up to below the present level during Pleistocene glacial periods revealed the vast lowlands known as Sundaland, enabling hunter-gatherer populations to freely access insular Southeast Asia via extensive terrestrial corridors. Modern human presence in the Niah cave on East Malaysia dates back to 40,000 years\u00a0BP, although archaeological documentation of the early settlement period suggests only brief occupation phases. However, author Charles Higham argues that despite glacial periods, modern humans were able to cross the sea barrier beyond Java and Timor, who around 45,000 years ago left traces in the Ivane Valley in eastern New Guinea \"at an altitude of exploiting yams and pandanus, hunting and making stone tools between 43,000 and 49,000 years ago.\"\nThe oldest habitation discovered in the Philippines is located at the Tabon Caves and dates back to approximately 50,000 years BP. Items found there such as burial jars, earthenware, jade ornaments and other jewellery, stone tools, animal bones and human fossils date back to 47,000 years\u00a0BP. Unearthed human remains are approximately 24,000 years old.\nSigns of an early tradition are discernible in the Hoabinhian, the name given to an industry and cultural continuity of stone tools and flaked cobble artefacts that appear around 10,000\u00a0BP in caves and rock shelters first described in H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh, Vietnam, and later documented in Terengganu, Malaysia, Sumatra, Thailand, Laos, Myanmar, Cambodia and Yunnan, southern China. Research emphasises considerable variations in quality and nature of the artefacts, influenced by region-specific environmental conditions and proximity and access to local resources. The Hoabinhian culture accounts for the first verified ritual burials in Southeast Asia.\nHoabinhian related genetic samples show the closest genetic affinities to basal East Asian lineages related to the Upper Paleolithic Tianyuan man from northern China, as well as the prehistoric J\u014dmon peoples of Japan. Compared to modern-day populations, they share the closest affinities with the Andamanese Onge and Jarawa, and the Semang (also known as \"Malaysian Negritos\") and Maniq in the interior of the Malay Peninsula.\nNeolithic migrations.\nThe Neolithic was characterised by several migrations into Mainland and Island Southeast Asia from southern China by Austronesian, Austroasiatic, Kra-Dai and Hmong\u2013Mien speakers.\nThe most widespread migration event was the Austronesian expansion, which began around 5,500\u00a0BP (3,500\u00a0BCE) from Taiwan and coastal southern China. Due to their early invention of ocean-going outrigger boats and voyaging catamarans, Austronesians rapidly colonised Island Southeast Asia, before spreading further into Micronesia, Melanesia, Polynesia, Madagascar and the Comoros. They dominated the lowlands and coasts of Island Southeast Asia, intermarrying with the indigenous Negrito and Papuan peoples to varying degrees, giving rise to modern Islander Southeast Asians, Micronesians, Polynesians, Melanesians and Malagasy.\nA separate migration wave, generally associated with Austroasiatic-speaking peoples, had expanded and migrated across the broad riverine floodplains of Mainland Southeast Asia and the Malaysian peninsula. A 2018 study identified a characteristic lineage that can be associated with the spread of Austroasiatic languages in Southeast Asia and which can be traced back to remains of Neolithic farmers from M\u00e1n B\u1ea1c (c.\u20092000 BCE) in the Red River Delta in northern Vietnam, and to closely related Ban Chiang and Vat Komnou remains in Thailand and Cambodia respectively.\nEarly agricultural societies.\nTerritorial principalities in both Insular and Mainland Southeast Asia, characterised as \"Agrarian kingdoms,\" developed an economy by around 500\u00a0BCE based on surplus crop cultivation and moderate coastal trade of domestic natural products. Several states of the Malayan-Indonesian \"thalassian\" zone shared these characteristics with Mainland Southeast Asian polities like the Pyu city-states in the Irrawaddy River valley, the V\u0103n Lang kingdom in the Red River Delta and Funan around the lower Mekong. V\u0103n Lang, founded in the 7th century BCE, endured until 258\u00a0BCE under the H\u1ed3ng B\u00e0ng dynasty, as part of the \u0110\u00f4ng S\u01a1n culture that sustained a dense and organised population that produced an elaborate Bronze Age industry.\nIntensive wet-rice cultivation in an ideal climate enabled the farming communities to produce a regular crop surplus that was used by the ruling elite to raise, command and pay work forces for public construction and maintenance projects such as canals and fortifications.\nThough millet and rice cultivation was introduced around 2000\u00a0BCE, hunting and gathering remained an important aspect of food provision, in particular in forested and mountainous inland areas. Many tribal communities of the aboriginal Australo-Melanesian settlers continued a lifestyle of mixed sustenance until the modern era. Many areas in Southeast Asia participated in the Maritime Jade Road, a diverse sea-based trade network which functioned for 3,000 years, mostly in Southeast Asia, between 2000\u00a0BCE to 1000\u00a0CE.\nBronze Age Southeast Asia.\nThe earliest known evidence of copper and bronze production in Southeast Asia was found at Ban Chiang in north-east Thailand and among the Ph\u00f9ng Nguy\u00ean culture of northern Vietnam around 2000\u00a0BCE.\nThe \u0110\u00f4ng S\u01a1n culture established a tradition of bronze production and the manufacture of evermore refined bronze and iron objects, such as plows, axes and sickles with shaft holes, socketed arrows and spearheads and small ornamented items. By about 500\u00a0BCE, large and delicately decorated bronze drums of remarkable quality, weighing more than , were produced in the laborious lost-wax casting process. This industry of highly sophisticated metal processing was developed independent of Chinese or Indian influence. Historians relate these achievements to the presence of organised, centralised and hierarchical communities and a large population.\nPottery culture.\nBetween 1000\u00a0BCE and 100\u00a0CE, the Sa Hu\u1ef3nh culture flourished along the south-central coast of Vietnam. Ceramic jar burial sites that included grave goods have been discovered at various sites along the entire territory. Among large, thin-walled terracotta jars, ornamented and colorised cooking pots, glass items, jade earrings and metal objects were deposited near the rivers and along the coast.\nThe Buni culture is the name given to another early independent centre of refined pottery production that has been well documented on the basis of excavated burial gifts, deposited between 400\u00a0BCE and 100\u00a0CE in coastal north-western Java. The objects and artifacts of the Buni tradition are known for their originality and remarkable quality of incised and geometric decors. Its resemblance to the Sa Hu\u1ef3nh culture and the fact that it represents the earliest \"Indian Rouletted Ware\" recorded in Southeast Asia are subjects of ongoing research.\nEarly historical era.\nAustronesian maritime trade network.\nThe first true maritime trade network in the Indian Ocean was the Austronesian maritime trade network initiated by the Austronesian peoples of Island Southeast Asia. They established trade routes with Southern India and Sri Lanka as early as 1500\u00a0BCE, exchanging material culture (like catamarans, outrigger boats, sewn-plank boats and paan) and cultigens (like coconuts, sandalwood, bananas and sugarcane). The trade network also connected the material cultures of India and China, as well as constituting the majority of the Indian Ocean component of the spice trade. Indonesians in particular were trading in spices (mainly cinnamon and cassia) with East Africa using catamarans and outrigger boats and sailing with the help of the Westerlies in the Indian Ocean. This trade network expanded to reach as far as Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, resulting in the Austronesian colonization of Madagascar by 500\u00a0CE. It continued through historic times, later becoming the Maritime Silk Road. This trade network also included smaller trade routes within Island Southeast Asia, including the lingling-o jade and trepanging networks.\nIn eastern Austronesia, various traditional maritime trade networks also existed. Among them were the ancient Lapita trade network of Island Melanesia; the Hiri trade cycle, Sepik Coast exchange and Kula ring of Papua New Guinea; the ancient trading voyages in Micronesia between the Mariana Islands and the Caroline Islands (and possibly also New Guinea and the Philippines); and the vast inter-island trade networks of Polynesia.\nIndianised kingdoms.\nBy around 500\u00a0BCE, Asia's expanding land and maritime trade led to socio-economic and cultural stimulation and diffusion of mainly Hindu beliefs into the regional cosmology of Southeast Asia. Iron Age trade expansion also caused regional geostrategic remodelling. Southeast Asia was now situated at the convergence of the Indian and the East Asian maritime trade routes, a basis for economic and cultural growth. The concept of \"Indianised kingdoms\", a term coined by French scholar George C\u0153d\u00e8s, describes how Southeast Asian principalities incorporated central aspects of Indian institutions, religion, statecraft, administration, culture, epigraphy, writing and architecture.\nThe earliest Hindu kingdoms emerged in Sumatra and Java, followed by mainland polities such as Funan and Champa. Selective adoption of Indian sociocultural elements stimulated the emergence of centralised states and development of highly organised societies. Local leaders began to adopt Hindu worship into state religion, using the Hindu concept of devar\u0101ja to reinforce divine rule (as opposed to the Chinese concept of Mandate of Heaven).\nThe exact nature, process and extent of Indian influence upon the civilisations of the region is still fiercely debated by contemporary scholars. One such debate is over the extent to which Indian merchants, Brahmins, nobles or Southeast Asian mariner-merchants played central roles in bringing Indian conceptions to Southeast Asia. Additionally, the depth of the influence of Indian traditions is still contested. Whereas early 20th-century scholars emphasized the thorough Indianisation of Southeast Asia, more recent authors have argued that Indian influence was much more limited, affecting only a small section of the elite.\nMaritime trade from China to India passed Champa and Funan at the Mekong Delta, proceeded along the coast to the Isthmus of Kra, portaged across the narrow and transhipped for distribution in India. This trading link boosted the development of Funan, its successor Chenla and the Malayan states of Langkasuka on the eastern coast and Kedah on the western.\nNumerous coastal communities in maritime Southeast Asia adopted Hindu and Buddhist cultural and religious elements from India and developed complex polities ruled by native dynasties. Early Hindu kingdoms in Indonesia include the 4th-century Kutai that rose in East Kalimantan, Tarumanagara in West Java and Kalingga in Central Java.\nEarly relations with China.\nThe earliest attested trading contacts in Southeast Asia were with the Chinese Shang dynasty (c.), when cowry shells served as currency. During the Zhou dynasty (1050\u2013771\u00a0BCE), various natural products, such as ivory, rhinoceros horn, tortoise shells, pearls and birds' feathers found their way to Luoyang, the Zhou capital. Although current knowledge about port localities and shipping lanes is very limited, it is assumed that most of this exchange took place on land routes, and only a small percentage was shipped \"on coastal vessels crewed by Malay and Yue traders\".\nMilitary conquests during the Han dynasty (202\u00a0BCE\u2013220\u00a0CE) brought a number of foreign peoples within the Chinese empire when the Imperial Chinese tributary system began to evolve under Han rule. This tributary system was based on the Chinese worldview that had developed under the Shang dynasty, in which China was deemed the center and apogee of culture and civilisation, the \"Middle kingdom\" (Mandarin: \u4e2d\u56fd, Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3), surrounded by several layers of increasingly barbarous peoples. Contact with Southeast Asia steadily increased by the end of the Han period.\nBetween the 2nd-century BCE and 15th-century CE, the Maritime Silk Road flourished, connecting China, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, the Arabian Peninsula, Somalia and all the way to Egypt and Europe. Despite its association with China in recent centuries, the Maritime Silk Road was primarily established and operated by Austronesian sailors in Southeast Asia and by Persian and Arab traders in the Arabian Sea.\nThe Maritime Silk Road developed from the earlier Austronesian spice trade networks of Islander Southeast Asians with Sri Lanka and Southern India (established 1000\u2013600\u00a0BCE), as well as the jade industry trade in \"lingling-o\" artifacts from the Philippines in the South China Sea (c.). For most of its history, Austronesian thalassocracies controlled the flow of the Maritime Silk Road, especially the polities around the Strait of Malacca and Bangka, the Malay Peninsula and the Mekong Delta (although Chinese records misidentified these kingdoms as being \"Indian\" due to the Indianisation of these regions). Prior to the 10th century, the route was primarily used by Southeast Asian traders, although Tamil and Persian traders also sailed them. The route was influential in the early spread of Hinduism and Buddhism to the East.\nChina later built its own fleets starting from the Song dynasty in the 10th century, participating directly in the trade route up until the end of the Colonial Era and the collapse of the Qing dynasty.\nSpread of Buddhism.\nLocal rulers benefited from the introduction of Hinduism during the early common era, using it to greatly enhance the legitimacy of their reign as devar\u0101ja. Historians increasingly argue that the process of Hindu religious diffusion in the region must be attributed to the initiative of the local chieftains. Buddhist teachings, which almost simultaneously arrived in Southeast Asia, developed during the subsequent centuries, gaining more appeal among the general population. In the 3rd century BCE, the Buddhist Indian Emperor Ashoka initiated missionary efforts to send trained monks and missionaries abroad to proselytise Buddhism, including its sizeable body of literature, oral traditions, iconography and art. To missionaries used Buddhist teachings to offer guidance in central existential questions, placing an emphasis on individual effort and conduct.\nBetween the 5th and the 13th century CE, Buddhism flourished in Southeast Asia. By the 8th century, the Buddhist Srivijaya kingdom based in Sumatra emerged as a major trading power in central Maritime Southeast Asia. Around the same period, the Shailendra dynasty of Java extensively promoted Buddhist art that found its strongest expression in the vast Borobudur temple. Following the establishment of the Khmer Empire in Cambodia, the first Buddhist kings of Mainland Southeast Asia emerged during the 11th century. Mahayana Buddhism took hold first in Southeast Asia, as the original Theravada Buddhism had fallen out of favor India centuries before reaching the region. However, a pure form of Theravada Buddhist teachings had been preserved in Sri Lanka since the 3rd century. Pilgrims and wandering monks from Sri Lanka introduced Theravada Buddhism in the Pagan Empire of Burma, the Sukhothai Kingdom in northern Thailand and Laos, the Lower Mekong Basin during Cambodia's dark ages and further into Vietnam and Maritime Southeast Asia.\nMedieval period.\nIn Maritime Southeast Asia, the Srivijaya kingdom on Sumatra developed into the dominant power by the 5th century CE. Its capital Palembang became a major seaport and functioned as an \"entrep\u00f4t\" on the Spice Route between India and China. Srivijaya was also a notable center of Vajray\u0101na Buddhist learning and influence. Around the 6th century CE, Malay merchants began sailing to Srivijaya, where goods were transported directly in Sumatran ports. The winds of the Northeast Monsoon during October to December prevented sailing ships from proceeding directly from the Indian Ocean to the South China Sea, as did the Southwest Monsoon during July to September, forcing trade routes to pass through Srivijaya. However, the kingdom's wealth and influence began to fade when advancements in nautical technology in the 10th century enabled Chinese and Indian merchants to ship cargo directly between their countries. These advancements also aided the Chola dynasty of Tamilakam, Southern India, in carrying out a series of destructive attacks on Srivijaya, effectively ending Palembang's \"entrep\u00f4t\" position in the Indo-Chinese trade route. As the influence of the Srivijaya kingdom faded by about the 13th century, Sumatra came to be ruled by a kaleidoscope of Buddhist kingdoms for the next two centuries, including the Malayu, Pannai, and Dharmasraya kingdoms.\nTo the southeast of Sumatra, West Java was ruled by the Hindu Sunda Kingdom (c.\u2009669\u20131579) after the fall of the Tarumanagara, while Central and East Java were dominated by a myriad of competing agrarian kingdoms including the Mataram kingdom (716\u20131016), Kadiri (1042\u20131222), Singhasari (1222\u20131292), and Majapahit (1293\u2013c.\u20091500). In the late 8th and early 9th centuries, the \u015aailendra dynasty that ruled the Mataram kingdom built a number of massive monuments in Central Java, including the Sewu and Borobudur Buddhist temples. According to the \"De\u015bavar\u1e47ana\", an Old Javanese poem completed in 1365, vassal states of the Majapahit Empire spread throughout much of today's Indonesia, making it possibly the largest empire ever to exist in Southeast Asia, though the true character of its control over these territories is unclear. The empire declined in the early 16th century after the rise of Islamic states in coastal Java, the Malay Peninsula, and Sumatra.\nIn the Philippines, the Laguna Copperplate Inscription dating from 900 CE is the earliest known calendar-dated document from the islands. It relates a debt granted from a \"maginoo\" (royalty) who lived in the Tagalog city-state of Tondo which is now part of Manila area. The document mentions several contemporary states in the area, including Mataram kingdom in Java.\nThe Khmer Empire covered much of mainland Southeast Asia from the early 9th until the 15th century, during which time a sophisticated architecture was developed, exemplified in the structures of the capital city Angkor. Situated in modern-day Vietnam, the kingdoms of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t and Champa were rivals to the Khmer Empire in the region. The Mon kingdom of Dvaravati was another major regional presence, first appearing in records around the 6th century CE. By the 10th century, however, Dvaravati had come under the influence of the Khmer. Nearby, Thai tribes conquered the Chao Phraya River valley of modern-day central Thailand around the 12th century and established the Sukhothai Kingdom in the 13th century and the Ayutthaya Kingdom in the 14th century.\nBy the mid-16th century, the Burmese First Toungoo Empire was one of the largest, strongest and richest empires in Southeast Asia. At its peak, it was the dominant power in mainland Southeast Asia, exercising \"suzerainty from Manipur to the Cambodian marches and from the borders of Arakan to Yunnan\". The empire included Mon and Shan states and annexed territories in the Kingdom of Lan Na, Kingdom of Laos, and the Ayutthaya kingdom. Early European accounts describe the lower part of the Toungoo Empire as having possessed 3\u20134 excellent ports that facilitated considerable trade in a variety of goods. The empire supplied the port of Malacca with rice and other foodstuffs, along with luxury goods such as rubies, sapphires, musk, lac, benzoin, and gold to trade. In return, the lower part of the empire imported Chinese manufactures and Indonesian spices through its ports. Additionally, merchants from West Asia and India exchanged large quantities of Indian textiles for Burmese luxury products and eastern goods. The arrival of the Portuguese in the 16th century further strengthened the empire's position, both commercially and militarily.\nSpread of Islam.\nBy the 8th century CE, less than 200 years after the establishment of Islam in Arabia, the first Islamic traders and merchants began to appear in maritime Southeast Asia. However, Islam did not play a notable role anywhere in mainland Southeast Asia until the 13th century. Instead, widespread and gradual replacement of Hinduism by Therav\u0101da Buddhism reflected a shift to a more personal, introverted spirituality acquired through individual ritual activities and effort.\nIn addressing the issue of how Islam was introduced into Southeast Asia, historians have elaborated various routes from Arabia to India and then from India to Southeast Asia. Of these, two seem to take prominence: either Arabian traders and scholars who did not live or settle in India spread Islam directly to maritime Southeast Asia, or Arab traders that had been settling in coastal India and Sri Lanka for generations did. Muslim traders from India (Gujarat) and converts of South Asian descent are variously considered to play a major role.\nA number of sources propose the South China Sea as another route of Islamic introduction to Southeast Asia. Arguments for this hypothesis include the following:\nIn 2013, the European Union published the \"European Commission Forum\", which maintains an inclusive attitude on the matter:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Islam spread in Southeast Asia via Muslims of diverse ethnic and cultural origins, from Middle Easterners, Arabs and Persians, to Indians and even Chinese, all of whom followed the great commercial routes of the epoch.\nUnlike in other Islamic regions, Islam developed in Southeast Asia in a distinctly syncretic manner that allowed the continuation and inclusion of elements and ritual practices of Hinduism, Buddhism and ancient Pan-East Asian animism. Most principalities developed highly distinctive cultures as a result of centuries of active participation in cultural exchange situated at the cross-roads of the Maritime Silk Road coming from across the Indian Ocean in the West and the South China Sea in the East. Cultural and institutional adoption was a creative and selective process, in which foreign elements were incorporated into a local synthesis. Unlike some other \"Islamised\" regions like North Africa, Iberia, the Middle East and later northern India, Islamic faith in Southeast Asia was not enforced in the wake of territorial conquests, but because of trade routes. In this way, the Islamisation of Southeast Asia is more akin to that of Turkic Central Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, southern India and northwest China.\nThere are various records of lay Muslim missionaries, scholars and mystics, particularly Sufis, who were active in peacefully proselytizing in Southeast Asia. Java, for example, received Islam by nine men, referred to as the \"Wali Sanga\" or \"Nine Saints,\" although the historical identity of such people is almost impossible to determine. The foundation of the first Islamic kingdom in Sumatra, the Samudera Pasai Sultanate, took place during the 13th century.\nThe conversion of the remnants of the Buddhist Srivijaya empire that once controlled trade in much of Southeast Asia, in particular the Strait of Malacca, marked a religious turning point with the conversion of the strait into an Islamic water. With the fall of Srivijaya, the way was open for effective and widespread proselytization and the establishment of Muslim trading centers. Many modern Malays view the Sultanate of Malacca, which existed from the 15th to the early 16th century, as the first political entity of contemporary Malaysia.\nThe idea of equality before God for the \"Ummah\" (the people of God) and a personal religious effort through regular prayer in Islam could have been more appealing than a perceived fatalism in Hinduism at the time. However, Islam also taught obedience and submission, which could have helped guarantee that the social structure of a converted people or political entity saw less fundamental changes.\nIslam and its notion of exclusivity and finality is seemingly incompatible with other religions, including the Chinese concept of heavenly harmony and the Son of Heaven as its enforcer. The integration of the traditional East Asian tributary system with China at the centre Muslim Malays and Indonesians exacted a pragmatic approach of cultural Islam in diplomatic relations with China.\nChinese treasure voyages.\nBy the end of the 14th century, Ming China had conquered Yunnan in the South, yet it had lost control of the Silk Road after the fall of the Mongol Yuan dynasty. The ruling Yongle Emperor resolved to focus on the Indian Ocean sea routes, seeking to consolidate the ancient Imperial Tributary System, establish greater diplomatic and military presence, and widen the Chinese sphere of influence. He ordered the construction of a huge trade and representation fleet that, between 1405 and 1433, undertook several voyages into Southeast Asia, India, the Persian Gulf, and as far as East Africa. Under the leadership of Zheng He, hundreds of naval vessels of then unparalleled size, grandeur, and technological advancement and manned by sizeable military contingents, ambassadors, merchants, artists and scholars repeatedly visited major Southeast Asian principalities. The individual fleets engaged in a number of clashes with pirates and occasionally supported various royal contenders. However, pro-expansionist voices at the court in Beijing lost influence after the 1450s, and the voyages were discontinued. The protraction of the ritualistic ceremonies and scanty travels of emissaries in the Tributary System alone was not sufficient to develop firm and lasting Chinese commercial and political influence in the region, especially during the impending onset of highly competitive global trade. During the Chenghua period of the Ming Dynasty, Liu Daxia, who later became the Shangshu of the Ministry of War, hid or burned the archives of Ming treasure voyages.\nEarly modern era.\nEuropean colonisation.\nThe earliest Europeans to have visited Southeast Asia were Marco Polo during the 13th century in the service of Kublai Khan and Niccol\u00f2 de' Conti during the early 15th century. Regular and momentous voyages only began in the 16th century after the arrival of the Portuguese, who actively sought direct and competitive trade. They were usually accompanied by missionaries, who hoped to promote Christianity.\nPortugal was the first European power to establish a bridgehead on the lucrative maritime Southeast Asia trade route, with the conquest of the Sultanate of Malacca in 1511. The Netherlands and Spain followed and soon superseded Portugal as the main European powers in the region. In 1599, Spain began to colonise the Philippines via the Mexico-governed Viceroyalty of New Spain, which the Philippines was territory of. In 1619, acting through the Dutch East India Company, the Dutch took the city of Sunda Kelapa, renamed it Batavia (now Jakarta) as a base for trading and expansion into the other parts of Java and the surrounding territory. In 1641, the Dutch took Malacca from the Portuguese. Economic opportunities attracted Overseas Chinese to the region in great numbers. In 1775, the Lanfang Republic, possibly the first republic in the region, was established in West Kalimantan, Indonesia, as a tributary state of the Qing Empire; the republic lasted until 1884, when it fell under Dutch occupation as Qing influence waned.\nThe British, in the guise of the East India Company led by Josiah Child, had little interest or impact in the region, and were effectively expelled following the Anglo-Siamese War. Britain later turned their attention to the Bay of Bengal following the Peace with France and Spain (1783). During the conflicts, Britain had struggled for naval superiority with the French, and the need of good harbours became evident. Penang Island had been brought to the attention of the Government of India by Francis Light. In 1786, the settlement of George Town was founded at the northeastern tip of Penang Island by Captain Francis Light, under the administration of Sir John Macpherson; this marked the beginning of British expansion into the Malay Peninsula.\nThe British also temporarily possessed Dutch territories during the Napoleonic Wars; and Spanish areas in the Seven Years' War. In 1819, Stamford Raffles established Singapore as a key trading post for Britain in their rivalry with the Dutch. However, their rivalry cooled in 1824 when an Anglo-Dutch treaty demarcated their respective interests in Southeast Asia. British rule in Burma began with the first Anglo-Burmese War (1824\u20131826).\nEarly United States entry into what was then called the East Indies (usually in reference to the Malay Archipelago) was low key. In 1795, a secret voyage for pepper set sail from Salem, Massachusetts on an 18-month voyage that returned with a bulk cargo of pepper, the first to be so imported into the country, which sold at the extraordinary profit of seven hundred per cent. In 1831, the merchantman \"Friendship\" of Salem returned to report the ship had been plundered, and the first officer and two crewmen murdered in Sumatra.\nThe Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 obligated the Dutch to ensure the safety of shipping and overland trade in and around Aceh, who accordingly sent the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army on the punitive expedition of 1831. President Andrew Jackson also ordered America's first Sumatran punitive expedition of 1832, which was followed by a punitive expedition in 1838. The \"Friendship\" incident thus afforded the Dutch a reason to take over Ache; and Jackson, to dispatch diplomatist Edmund Roberts, who in 1833 secured the Roberts Treaty with Siam. In 1856, negotiations for amendment of this treaty, Townsend Harris stated the position of the United States:The United States does not hold any possessions in the East, nor does it desire any. The form of government forbids the holding of colonies. The United States therefore cannot be an object of jealousy to any Eastern Power. Peaceful commercial relations, which give as well as receive benefits, is what the President wishes to establish with Siam, and such is the object of my mission.\nFrom the end of the 1850s onwards, while the attention of the United States shifted to maintaining their union, the pace of European colonisation shifted to a significantly higher gear. This phenomenon, denoted New Imperialism, saw the conquest of nearly all Southeast Asian territories by the colonial powers. The Dutch East India Company and British East India Company were dissolved by their respective governments, who took over the direct administration of the colonies. \nOnly Thailand was spared the experience of foreign rule, though Thailand, too, was greatly affected by the power politics of the Western powers. The Monthon reforms of the late 19th Century continuing up till around 1910, imposed a Westernised form of government on the country's partially independent cities called Mueang, such that the country could be said to have successfully colonised itself. Western powers did, however, continue to interfere in both internal and external affairs.\nBy 1913, the British had occupied Burma, Malaya and the northern Borneo territories, the French occupied Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, the Dutch ruled the Netherlands East Indies, while Portugal managed to hold on to Portuguese Timor. In the Philippines, the 1872 Cavite Mutiny was a precursor to the Philippine Revolution (1896\u20131898). When the Spanish\u2013American War began in Cuba in 1898, Filipino revolutionaries declared Philippine independence and established the First Philippine Republic the following year. In the Treaty of Paris of 1898 that ended the war with Spain, the United States gained the Philippines and other territories; in refusing to recognise the nascent republic, America effectively reversed her position of 1856. This led directly to the Philippine\u2013American War, in which the First Republic was defeated; wars followed with the Republic of Zamboanga, the Republic of Negros and the Republic of Katagalugan, all of which were also defeated.\nColonial rule had had a profound effect on Southeast Asia. While the colonial powers profited much from the region's vast resources and large market, colonial rule did develop the region to a varying extent. Commercial agriculture, mining and an export based economy developed rapidly during this period. The introduction Christianity bought by the colonist also have profound effect in the societal change.\nIncreased labour demand resulted in mass immigration, especially from British India and China, which brought about massive demographic change. The institutions for a modern nation state like a state bureaucracy, courts of law, print media and to a smaller extent, modern education, sowed the seeds of the fledgling nationalist movements in the colonial territories. In the inter-war years, these nationalist movements grew and often clashed with the colonial authorities when they demanded self-determination.\n20th-century Southeast Asia.\nJapanese invasion and occupations.\nIn September 1940, following the Fall of France and pursuant to the Pacific war goals of Imperial Japan, the Japanese Imperial Army invaded Vichy French Indochina, which ended in the abortive Japanese coup de main in French Indochina of 9 March 1945. On 5 January 1941, Thailand launched the Franco-Thai War, ended on 9 May 1941 by a Japanese-imposed treaty signed in Tokyo. On 7/8 December, Japan's entry into World War II began with the invasion of Thailand, the only invaded country to maintain nominal independence, due to her political and military alliance with the Japanese\u2014on 10 May 1942, her northwestern Payap Army invaded Burma during the Burma Campaign. From 1941 until war's end, Japanese occupied Cambodia, Malaya and the Philippines, which ended in independence movements. Japanese occupation of the Philippines led to the forming of the Second Philippine Republic, formally dissolved in Tokyo on 17 August 1945. Also on 17 August, a proclamation of Indonesian Independence was read at the conclusion of Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies since March 1942.\nPost-war decolonisation.\nWith the rejuvenated nationalist movements in wait, the Europeans returned to a very different Southeast Asia after World War II. Indonesia declared independence on 17 August 1945 and subsequently fought a bitter war against the returning Dutch; the Philippines was granted independence by the United States in 1946; Burma secured their independence from Britain in 1948, and the French were driven from Southeast Asia in 1954 after a bitterly fought war (the Indochina War) against communist Vietnamese nationalists. The United Nations provided a forum for nationalism, post-independent self-definition, nation-building and the acquisition of territorial integrity for many newly independent nations.\nDuring the Cold War, countering the threat of communism was a major theme in the decolonisation process. After suppressing the communist insurrection during the Malayan Emergency from 1948 to 1960, Britain granted independence to Malaya and later, Singapore, Sabah and Sarawak in 1957 and 1963 respectively within the framework of the Federation of Malaysia. In one of the most bloody single incidents of violence in Cold War Southeast Asia, General Suharto seized power in Indonesia in 1965 and initiated a massacre of approximately 500,000 alleged members of the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI).\nAfter French defeat in \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7, France granted complete independence to the anti-communist State of Vietnam on 4 June 1954 before the communists took over the North in July. North Vietnamese attempts to conquer South Vietnam resulted in the Vietnam War. The conflict spread to Laos and Cambodia and heavy intervention from the United States. By the war's end in 1975, all these countries were controlled by communist parties. After the communist victory, two wars between communist states\u2014the Cambodian\u2013Vietnamese War of 1975\u201389 and the Sino-Vietnamese War of 1979\u2014were fought in the region. The victory of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia resulted in the Cambodian genocide.\nIn 1975, Portuguese rule ended in East Timor. However, independence was short-lived as Indonesia annexed the territory soon after. However, after more than 20 years of fighting Indonesia, East Timor won its independence and was recognised by the UN in 2002. Finally, Britain ended its protectorate of the Sultanate of Brunei in 1984, marking the end of European rule in Southeast Asia.\nContemporary Southeast Asia.\nModern Southeast Asia has been characterised by high economic growth by most countries and closer regional integration. Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand have traditionally experienced high growth and are commonly recognised as the more developed countries of the region. As of late, Vietnam too had been experiencing an economic boom. However, Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos and the newly independent Timor-Leste (aka East Timor) are still lagging economically.\nOn 8 August 1967, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) was founded by Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines. Since Cambodian admission into the union in 1999, East Timor is the only Southeast Asian country that is not part of ASEAN, although plans are under way for eventual membership. The association aims to enhance co-operation among Southeast Asian community. ASEAN Free Trade Area has been established to encourage greater trade among ASEAN members. ASEAN has also been a front runner in greater integration of Asia-Pacific region through East Asia Summits.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is usually measured either in picometres (pm) or angstroms (\u00c5), with 1\u00a0\u00c5\u00a0= 100\u00a0pm.\nIn principle, the sum of the two covalent radii should equal the covalent bond length between two atoms, \"R\"(AB) = \"r\"(A) + \"r\"(B). Moreover, different radii can be introduced for single, double and triple bonds (r1, r2 and r3 below), in a purely operational sense. These relationships are certainly not exact because the size of an atom is not constant but depends on its chemical environment. For heteroatomic A\u2013B bonds, ionic terms may enter. Often the polar covalent bonds are shorter than would be expected based on the sum of covalent radii. Tabulated values of covalent radii are either average or idealized values, which nevertheless show a certain transferability between different situations, which makes them useful.\nThe bond lengths \"R\"(AB) are measured by X-ray diffraction (more rarely, neutron diffraction on molecular crystals). Rotational spectroscopy can also give extremely accurate values of bond lengths. For homonuclear A\u2013A bonds, Linus Pauling took the covalent radius to be half the single-bond length in the element, e.g. \"R\"(H\u2013H, in H2)\u00a0= 74.14\u00a0pm so \"r\"cov(H)\u00a0= 37.07\u00a0pm: in practice, it is usual to obtain an average value from a variety of covalent compounds, although the difference is usually small. Sanderson has published a recent set of non-polar covalent radii for the main-group elements, but the availability of large collections of bond lengths, which are more transferable, from the Cambridge Crystallographic Database has rendered covalent radii obsolete in many situations.\nAverage radii.\nThe values in the table below are based on a statistical analysis of more than 228,000 experimental bond lengths from the Cambridge Structural Database. For carbon, values are given for the different hybridisations of the orbitals.\nRadius for multiple bonds.\nA different approach is to make a self-consistent fit for all elements in a smaller set of molecules. This was done separately for single,\ndouble,\nand triple bonds\nup to superheavy elements. Both experimental and computational data were used. \nThe single-bond results are often similar to those of Cordero et al. When they are different, the coordination numbers used can be different. This is notably the case for most (d and f) transition metals. Normally one expects that \"r\"1 &gt; \"r\"2 &gt; \"r\"3. Deviations may occur for weak multiple bonds, if the differences of the ligand are larger than the differences of \"R\" in the data used.\nNote that elements up to atomic number 118 (oganesson) have now been experimentally produced and that there are chemical studies on an increasing number of them. The same, self-consistent approach was used to fit tetrahedral covalent radii for 30 elements in 48 crystals with subpicometer accuracy.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "37708", "revid": "1313924591", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37708", "title": "Flare", "text": "Pyrotechnic light source\nA flare, also sometimes called a fus\u00e9e, fusee, or bengala, bengalo in several European countries, is a type of pyrotechnic that produces a bright light or intense heat without an explosion. Flares are used for distress signaling, illumination, or defensive countermeasures in civilian and military applications. Flares may be ground pyrotechnics, projectile pyrotechnics, or parachute-suspended to provide maximum illumination time over a large area. Projectile pyrotechnics may be dropped from aircraft, fired from rocket or artillery, or deployed by flare guns or handheld percussive tubes.\nOrigin.\nThe earliest recorded use of gunpowder for signaling purposes was the 'signal bomb' used by the Chinese Song Dynasty (960\u20131279) as the Mongol-led Yuan Dynasty (1271\u20131368) besieged Yangzhou in 1276. These soft-shelled bombs, timed to explode in midair, were used to send messages to a detachment of troops far in the distance. Another mention of the signal bomb appears in a text dating from 1293 requesting their collection from those still stored in Zhejiang. A signal gun appears in Korea by 1600. The \"Wu I Thu Phu Thung Chih\" or \"Illustrated Military Encyclopedia\", written in 1791, depicts a signal gun in an illustration.\nCivilian use.\nIn the civilian world, flares are commonly used as signals, and may be ignited on the ground, fired as an aerial signal from a pistol-like flare gun, or launched from a self-contained tube. Flares are commonly found in marine survival kits.\nMaritime distress signal.\nDistress rockets (aka \"rocket-propelled parachute flares\") have been mentioned in the modern era for civilian maritime emergencies since at least 1856. The \"U.S. Nautical Magazine\" of that year mentions the use of \"rocket stations\" for ship related emergencies. White rockets were solely used until 1873, when commander John Yorke of the Royal Navy suggested that rockets for distress should have a distinctive color. The request was made to help ease confusion between ships in distress and rockets used by pilot ships. By 1875, the UK Board of Trade had issued regulations for captains in regards to night signals. Rockets containing at least 16oz of composition were only to be used as a sign for a ship in distress. Passenger ships at the time were required to carry 12 of these rockets. The Merchant Shipping Act 1894 further stated that these rockets were to be fired one at a time in short intervals of approximately one minute apart. Distress rockets continued to be used in different colors, as was the case with RMS \"Titanic\". At the time shipping companies had \"a particular kind of distress rocket (that differed by color)\". Each ship was also given a guide of colors to use depending on what signal was to be sent.\nModern red distress signals are mentioned by the United States Bureau of Mines as early as 1959, where they state \"12 handheld rocket-propelled parachute red flare distress signals\" are to be used by ocean going ships. The color red was eventually incorporated for use in the United States on 17 December 1979 as part of a \"Universal color language\". Red distress rockets and/or flares are now internationally recognized symbols that indicate a ship in distress. The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) has standards for visual signals, including both handheld and aerial flares. Handheld flares must burn for at least one minute at an average luminosity of 15,000 candelas, while aerial flares must burn for at least 40 seconds with a 30,000-candela average luminosity.\nWhile rockets and flares are still an option for signaling distress, they have since been surpassed by improved technology. Distress signals can now be sent using automated radio signals from a search and rescue transponder. Other internationally recognized methods include the radio message SOS, which was used during the 1912 sinking of the \"Titanic\", and the emergency procedure word \"Mayday\", which dates to the 1920s.\nRoadside and rail.\nAnother type of flare is the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;fusee, which burns with a bright red light. These come in two main types which are used for roadways and rail transportation. The first type are fusees used for roadways which are known as \"highway flares\" or \"road flares\". These are commonly used to indicate obstacles or advise caution on roadways at night and are found in roadside emergency kits. Law enforcement also may use these flares (either propped on a biped or laid flat) to signal traffic hazards or that a road is blocked, often as a more visible replacement for traffic cones. Law enforcement in the United States usually use magnesium-based flares that last from 15\u201330 minutes.\nFusees used for rail are known as \"railroad flares\", they are commonly used to perform hand signals or used as torches in rail transport applications. Railroad flares can burn for at least 10 minutes, are not fastened to train cars, and are handheld by railroad personnel for protection at night. It was argued during an Appeals case that railroad flares are much more visible than lanterns. In general: trains that encounter a lit railroad flare are required to stop until it burns out. Fusees made specifically for railroad use can be distinguished from highway fusees by a sharp steel spike at one end, used to embed the fusee upright in a wooden railroad tie.\nForestry and firefighting.\nIn forestry and firefighting, fusees are sometimes used in wildfire suppression and in the ignition of controlled burns. They ignite at and burn as hot as .\nProtests.\nFlares are used by law enforcement agencies such as the United States National Guard, and police as a form of riot control. This practice dates back to at least the 1940s where they are mentioned as being \"useful in night operations\". Handheld flares are also counter used by protestors at demonstrations.\nMilitary use.\nMaritime signal flare.\nIn 1859, Martha Coston patented the Coston flare based on early work by her deceased husband Benjamin Franklin Coston.\nIllumination.\nIn 1922, a \"landing flare\" was an aerial candle attached to a parachute and used for landing an airplane in the dark. The flare burned for less than four minutes and the candlepower was about 40,000 lumens. During World War II, the U.S. Navy tested underwater flares for use in detecting submarines.\nCountermeasure.\nA special variety of flares is used in military aircraft as a defensive countermeasure against heat-seeking missiles. These flares are usually discharged individually or in salvos by the pilot or automatically by tail-warning devices and are accompanied by vigorous evasive maneuvering. Since they are intended to deceive infrared missiles, these flares burn at temperatures of thousands of degrees, incandescing in the visible spectrum as well.\nTripflares.\nFlares connected to tripwires are used to guard an area against infiltration. The flare begins burning when the tripwire is triggered, providing both alarm and illumination.\nRegulation.\nUnder the UN hazard number system, pyrotechnic flares are designated class 1.4 explosives.\nSeveral U.S. states, including California and Massachusetts, have begun regulating levels of potassium perchlorate, which can be unsafe at certain levels in drinking water. Contaminated drinking water can lead to such symptoms as gastric irritation, nausea, vomiting, fever, skin rashes, and even fatal aplastic anemia (a reduction in all types of blood cells).\nChemistry.\nFlares produce their light through the combustion of a pyrotechnic composition. The ingredients are varied, but often based on strontium nitrate, potassium nitrate, or potassium perchlorate, mixed with a fuel such as charcoal, sulfur, sawdust, aluminium, magnesium, or a suitable polymeric resin. Flares may be colored by the inclusion of pyrotechnic colorants. Calcium flares are used underwater to illuminate submerged objects.\nPerchlorate flare health issues.\nMany in-service colored signal flares and spectrally balanced decoy flares contain perchlorate oxidizers. Perchlorate, a type of salt in its solid form, dissolves and moves rapidly in groundwater and surface water. Even in low concentrations in drinking water supplies, perchlorate is known to inhibit the uptake of iodine by the thyroid gland. While there are currently no US federal drinking water standards for perchlorate, some states have established public health goals or action levels, and some are in the process of establishing state maximum contaminant levels. For example, the US Environmental Protection Agency has studied the impacts of perchlorate on the environment as well as drinking water. California has also issued guidance regarding perchlorate use.\nUS courts have taken action regarding the use of perchlorate in manufacturing pyrotechnic devices such as flares. For example, in 2003, a federal district court in California found that the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) applied because perchlorate is ignitable and therefore a \"characteristic\" hazardous waste. Flares manufactured in the United States no longer use potassium perchlorate as an oxidizer and do not contain aluminium or magnesium.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The enthalpy of vaporization is a function of the pressure and temperature at which the transformation (vaporization or evaporation) takes place.\nThe enthalpy of vaporization is often quoted for the normal boiling temperature of the substance. Although tabulated values are usually corrected to 298\u00a0K, that correction is often smaller than the uncertainty in the measured value.\nThe heat of vaporization is temperature-dependent, though a constant heat of vaporization can be assumed for small temperature ranges and for reduced temperature \"Tr\" \u226a 1. The heat of vaporization diminishes with increasing temperature and it vanishes completely at a certain point called the critical temperature (\"Tr\" = 1). Above the critical temperature, the liquid and vapor phases are indistinguishable, and the substance is called a supercritical fluid.\nUnits.\nValues are usually quoted in J/mol, or kJ/mol (molar enthalpy of vaporization), although kJ/kg, or J/g (specific heat of vaporization), and older units like kcal/mol, cal/g and Btu/lb are sometimes still used among others.\nEnthalpy of condensation.\nThe enthalpy of condensation (or heat of condensation) is by definition equal to the enthalpy of vaporization with the opposite sign: enthalpy changes of vaporization are always positive (heat is absorbed by the substance), whereas enthalpy changes of condensation are always negative (heat is released by the substance).\nThermodynamic background.\nThe enthalpy of vaporization can be written as \nformula_1\nIt is equal to the increased internal energy of the vapor phase compared with the liquid phase, plus the work done against ambient pressure. The increase in the internal energy can be viewed as the energy required to overcome the intermolecular interactions in the liquid (or solid, in the case of sublimation). Hence helium has a particularly low enthalpy of vaporization, 0.0845\u00a0kJ/mol, as the van der Waals forces between helium atoms are particularly weak. On the other hand, the molecules in liquid water are held together by relatively strong hydrogen bonds, and its enthalpy of vaporization, 40.65\u00a0kJ/mol, is more than five times the energy required to heat the same quantity of water from 0\u00a0\u00b0C to 100\u00a0\u00b0C (\"c\"p\u00a0= 75.3\u00a0J/K\u00b7mol). Care must be taken, however, when using enthalpies of vaporization to \"measure\" the strength of intermolecular forces, as these forces may persist to an extent in the gas phase (as is the case with hydrogen fluoride), and so the calculated value of the bond strength will be too low. This is particularly true of metals, which often form covalently bonded molecules in the gas phase: in these cases, the enthalpy of atomization must be used to obtain a true value of the bond energy.\nAn alternative description is to view the enthalpy of condensation as the heat which must be released to the surroundings to compensate for the drop in entropy when a gas condenses to a liquid. As the liquid and gas are in equilibrium at the boiling point (\"T\"b), \u0394v\"G\"\u00a0=\u00a00, which leads to:\nformula_2\nAs neither entropy nor enthalpy vary greatly with temperature, it is normal to use the tabulated standard values without any correction for the difference in temperature from 298\u00a0K. A correction must be made if the pressure is different from 100\u00a0kPa, as the entropy of an ideal gas is proportional to the logarithm of its pressure. The entropies of liquids vary little with pressure, as the coefficient of thermal expansion of a liquid is small.\nThese two definitions are equivalent: the boiling point is the temperature at which the increased entropy of the gas phase overcomes the intermolecular forces. As a given quantity of matter always has a higher entropy in the gas phase than in a condensed phase (formula_3 is always positive), and from\nformula_4,\nthe Gibbs free energy change falls with increasing temperature: gases are favored at higher temperatures, as is observed in practice.\nVaporization enthalpy of electrolyte solutions.\nEstimation of the enthalpy of vaporization of electrolyte solutions can be simply carried out using equations based on the chemical thermodynamic models, such as Pitzer model or TCPC model.\nSelected values.\nElements.\nThe vaporization of metals is a key step in metal vapor synthesis, which exploits the increased reactivity of metal atoms or small particles relative to the bulk elements.\nOther common substances.\nEnthalpies of vaporization of common substances, measured at their respective standard boiling points:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Strictly speaking, in most jurisdictions, there are essentially no differences between the legal requirements to obtain a patent for an invention in the chemical or pharmaceutical fields, in comparison to obtaining a patent in the other fields, such as in the mechanical field. A chemical patent or a pharmaceutical patent is therefore \"not\" a \"sui generis\" right, i.e. a special legal type of patent.\nChemical patent claims often use generic, Markush structures contained within them, named after the inventor Eugene Markush who won a lawsuit in the US in 1925 to allow such structures to be used in patent claims. These generic structures are used to make the patent claim as broad as possible.\nIn the United States, patents on pharmaceuticals were considered unethical by the medical profession during most of the nineteenth-century. Drug patent terms in the US were extended from 17 to 20 years in 1994.\nPharmaceutical patents are typically more valuable than any other type of patents, and thus play an essential role in the pharmaceutical industry. There are several reasons for this peculiarity:\nA 2021 analysis of the most valuable US pharmaceutical patents published in the Orange Book between 2000 and 2018 showed that ca. 25% of these patents end up litigated in courts, but only 26% of these litigated patents are invalidated, well below the overall patent invalidation rate of 43%. 94% of these invalidated patents are not the highly innovative \u201cprimary\u2019 patents on the active ingredient, but weaker follow-on patents (that claim changes in formulation, dissolution profile, new use), that should have not been allowed by examiners in the first place. Remarkably, the prosecution histories of most of these invalidated patents share striking similarity in having the same assignees, the same prosecuting attorneys, and the same examiners. Examiners approve litigated patents after having issued fewer office actions than they do with unlitigated patents. For litigated patents it takes approximately five office actions before allowance. In contrast, for the average, it takes approximately eight office actions before an allowance. \nThe main reason for invalidating these weak follow-up patents in courts is obviousness in view of the prior art, which was not considered by the examiner. Nevertheless, the authors conclude, that \"having examiners spend more time on the important patents ... is not likely to help much; examiners who get more time to work on important cases now do not do more work, but instead cut and paste their existing work from prior cases.\" As a better alternative, the authors suggests, that the patent owners identify in advance, which patents they intend to list in the Orange Book, and have these patents examined by USPTO's Central Reexamination Unit with a higher level of scrutiny than regular examiners do.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "37713", "revid": "20442965", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37713", "title": "The Merchant of Venice", "text": "Play by Shakespeare\nThe Merchant of Venice is a play by William Shakespeare, believed to have been written between 1596 and 1598. A merchant in Venice named Antonio defaults on a large loan taken out on behalf of his dear friend, Bassanio, and provided by a Jewish moneylender, Shylock, with seemingly inevitable fatal consequences.\nAlthough classified as a comedy in the First Folio and sharing certain aspects with Shakespeare's other romantic comedies, the play is most remembered for its dramatic scenes, and it is best known for the character Shylock and his famous demand for a \"pound of flesh\".\nThe play contains two famous speeches, that of Shylock, \"Hath not a Jew eyes?\" on the subject of humanity, and that of Portia on \"the quality of mercy\". Debate exists on whether the play is antisemitic, with Shylock's insistence on his legal right to the pound of flesh being in opposition to his seemingly universal plea for the rights of all people suffering discrimination.\nCharacters.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPlot summary.\nBassanio, a young Venetian of noble rank, wishes to woo the beautiful and wealthy heiress of Belmont, Portia. Having squandered his estate, he needs 3,000 ducats to subsidise his expenditures as a suitor. Bassanio approaches his friend Antonio, a wealthy merchant of Venice, who has previously and repeatedly bailed him out. Antonio agrees, but has no liquid cash as his ships and merchandise are busy at sea to Tripolis, the Indies, Mexico and England \u2013 he promises to cover a bond if Bassanio can find a lender, so Bassanio turns to the Jewish moneylender Shylock and names Antonio as the loan's guarantor.\nAntonio has already antagonized Shylock through his outspoken antisemitism and because Antonio's habit of lending money without interest forces Shylock to charge lower rates. Shylock is at first reluctant to grant the loan, citing abuse he has suffered at Antonio's hand. He finally agrees to lend the sum to Bassanio without interest upon one condition: if Antonio were unable to repay it at the specified date, Shylock may take a pound of Antonio's flesh. Bassanio does not want Antonio to accept such a risky condition; Antonio is surprised by what he sees as the moneylender's generosity (no \"usance\" \u2013 interest \u2013 is asked for), and he signs the contract. With money in hand, Bassanio leaves for Belmont with his friend Gratiano, who has asked to accompany him. Gratiano is a likeable young man, but he is often flippant, overly talkative, and tactless. Bassanio warns his companion to exercise self-control, and the two leave for Belmont.\nMeanwhile, in Belmont, Portia is awash with suitors. Her father left a will stipulating that each of her suitors must choose correctly from one of three caskets, made of gold, silver and lead respectively. Whoever picks the right casket wins Portia's hand. The first suitor, the Prince of Morocco, chooses the gold casket, interpreting its slogan, \"Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire\", as referring to Portia. The second suitor, the conceited Prince of Aragon, chooses the silver casket, which proclaims, \"Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves\", as he believes he is full of merit. Both suitors leave empty-handed, having rejected the lead casket because of the baseness of its material and the uninviting nature of its slogan, \"Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath\". The last suitor is Bassanio, whom Portia wishes to succeed, having met him before. As Bassanio ponders his choice, members of Portia's household sing a song that says that \"fancy\" (not true love) is \"It is engendered in the eye, / With gazing fed\"; Bassanio chooses the lead casket and wins Portia's hand.\nIn Venice, news arrives that Antonio's ships have been lost at sea, leaving him unable to repay his bond to Shylock. Shylock, angered by his daughter Jessica's elopement with the Christian Lorenzo and her conversion, becomes more determined to exact revenge on the Christians. Jessica had taken with her a considerable portion of Shylock's wealth, including a turquoise ring given to him by his late wife, Leah. Shylock subsequently has Antonio summoned before the court.\nAt Belmont, Bassanio receives a letter telling him that Antonio has been unable to repay the loan from Shylock. Portia and Bassanio marry, as do Gratiano and Portia's handmaid Nerissa. Bassanio and Gratiano leave for Venice, with money from Portia, to save Antonio's life by offering the money to Shylock. Unknown to Bassanio and Gratiano, Portia sent her servant, Balthazar, to seek the counsel of Portia's cousin, Bellario, a lawyer, at Padua.\nThe climax of the play is set in the court of the Duke of Venice. Shylock refuses Bassanio's offer of 6,000 ducats, twice the amount of the loan. He demands his pound of flesh from Antonio. The Duke, wishing to save Antonio but unable to nullify a contract, refers the case to a visitor. He identifies himself as Balthazar, a young male \"doctor of the law\", bearing a letter of recommendation to the Duke from the learned lawyer Bellario. The doctor is Portia in disguise, and the law clerk who accompanies her is Nerissa, also disguised as a man. As Balthazar, Portia in a famous speech repeatedly asks Shylock to show mercy, advising him that mercy \"is twice blest: / It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.\" However, Shylock adamantly refuses any compensations and insists on the pound of flesh.\nAs the court grants Shylock his bond and Antonio prepares for Shylock's knife, Portia deftly appropriates Shylock's argument for \"specific performance\". She says that the contract allows Shylock to remove only the \"flesh\", not the blood, of Antonio &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;. Thus, if Shylock were to shed any drop of Antonio's blood, his \"lands and goods\" would be forfeited under Venetian laws. She tells him that he must cut precisely one pound of flesh, no more, no less; she advises him that \"if the scale do turn / But in the estimation of a hair, / Thou diest, and all thy goods are confiscate.\"\nDefeated, Shylock consents to accept Bassanio's offer of money for the defaulted bond: first his offer to pay \"the bond thrice\", which Portia rebuffs, telling him to take his bond, and then merely the principal; but Portia also prevents him from doing this, on the ground that he has already refused it \"in the open court\". She cites a law under which Shylock, as a Jew and therefore an \"alien\", having attempted to take the life of a citizen, has forfeited his property, half to the government and half to Antonio, leaving his life at the mercy of the Duke. The Duke spares Shylock's life and says he may remit the forfeiture. Portia says the Duke may waive the state's share, but not Antonio's. Antonio says he is content that the state waive its claim to half Shylock's wealth if he can have his one-half share \"in use\" until Shylock's death, when the principal would be given to Lorenzo and Jessica. Antonio also asks that \"for this favour\" Shylock convert to Christianity and bequeath his entire estate to Lorenzo and Jessica. The Duke then threatens to recant his pardon of Shylock's life unless he accepts these conditions. Shylock, re-threatened with death, accepts with the words, \"I am content.\"\nBassanio, unaware that the lawyer is his disguised wife, offers a gift in gratitude for the supposed legal assistance. Initially declining, Portia eventually requests his ring and Antonio's gloves. Antonio gives his gloves without hesitation, while Bassanio parts with the ring only after Antonio's persuasion, having earlier vowed to his wife never to lose, sell, or give it away. Nerissa, disguised as the lawyer's clerk, similarly obtains her own husband Gratiano's ring, as he fails to recognize her.\nAt Belmont, Portia and Nerissa playfully taunt and feign accusations against their husbands before revealing their true identities as the lawyer and clerk. Following reconciliations among the characters, Portia informs Antonio that three of his ships were not lost at sea and have safely returned.\nEarlier sources.\nThe forfeit of a merchant's deadly bond after standing surety for a friend's loan was a common tale in England in the late 16th century. In addition, the test of the suitors at Belmont, the merchant's rescue from the \"pound of flesh\" penalty by his friend's new wife disguised as a lawyer, and her demand for the betrothal ring in payment are all elements present in the 14th-century tale \"Il Pecorone\" by Giovanni Fiorentino, which was published in Milan in 1558. Elements of the trial scene are also found in \"The Orator\" by Alexandre Sylvane, published in translation in 1596. The story of the three caskets can be found in \"Gesta Romanorum\", a collection of tales probably compiled at the end of the 13th century.\nDate and text.\nThe date of composition of \"The Merchant of Venice\" is believed to be between 1596 and 1598. The play was mentioned by Francis Meres in 1598, so it must have been familiar on the stage by that date. The title page of the first edition in 1600 states that it had been performed \"divers times\" by that date. Salerino's reference to his ship the \"Andrew\" (I, i, 27) is thought to be an allusion to the Spanish ship \"St. Andrew\", captured by the English at C\u00e1diz in 1596. A date of 1596\u201397 is considered consistent with the play's style.\nThe play was entered in the Register of the Stationers Company, the method at that time of obtaining copyright for a new play, by James Roberts on 22 July 1598 under the title \"the Marchaunt of Venyce or otherwise called the Jewe of Venyce.\" On 28 October 1600 Roberts transferred his right to the play to the stationer Thomas Heyes; Heyes published the first quarto before the end of the year. It was printed again in 1619, as part of William Jaggard's so-called False Folio. (Later, Thomas Heyes' son and heir Laurence Heyes asked for and was granted a confirmation of his right to the play, on 8 July 1619.) The 1600 edition is generally regarded as being accurate and reliable. It is the basis of the text published in the 1623 First Folio, which adds a number of stage directions, mainly musical cues.\nThemes.\nShylock and the antisemitism debate.\nThe play is frequently staged, but is potentially troubling to modern audiences because of its central themes, which can easily appear antisemitic. Modern critics argue over the play's stance on the Jews and Judaism. American literary critic Harold Bloom argued in 1998 that \"one would have to be blind, deaf and dumb not to recognise that Shakespeare's grand, equivocal comedy \"The Merchant of Venice\" is nevertheless a profoundly anti-semitic work\".\nShylock as an antagonist.\nEnglish society in the Elizabethan and Jacobean era has been described as \"judeophobic\". English Jews had been expelled under Edward I in 1290 and were not permitted to return until 1656 under the rule of Oliver Cromwell. Poet John Donne, who was Dean of St Paul's Cathedral and a contemporary of Shakespeare, gave a sermon in 1624 perpetuating the Blood Libel \u2013 the entirely unsubstantiated antisemitic lie that Jews ritually murdered Christians to drink their blood and achieve salvation. In Venice and in some other places, Jews were required to wear a yellow or red hat at all times in public to make sure that they were easily identified, and had to live in a ghetto.\nShakespeare's play may be seen as a continuation of this tradition. The title page of the Quarto indicates that the play was sometimes known as \"The Jew of Venice\" in its day, which suggests that it was seen as similar to Marlowe's early 1590s work \"The Jew of Malta\". One interpretation of the play's structure is that Shakespeare meant to contrast the perceived mercy of the main Christian characters while giving the Jewish character vengeful characteristics. Similarly, it is possible that Shakespeare meant Shylock's forced conversion to Christianity to be a \"happy ending\" for the character, as, to some Christian audiences, it saves his soul and allows him to enter Heaven.\nRegardless of what Shakespeare's authorial intent may have been, the play has been made use of by antisemites throughout the play's history. The Nazis used the usurious Shylock for their propaganda. Shortly after Kristallnacht in 1938, \"The Merchant of Venice\" was broadcast for propagandistic ends over the German airwaves. Productions of the play followed in L\u00fcbeck (1938), Berlin (1940), and elsewhere within the Nazi territory.\nIn a series of articles called \"Observer\", first published in 1785, British playwright Richard Cumberland created a character named Abraham Abrahams, who is quoted as saying, \"I verily believe the odious character of Shylock has brought little less persecution upon us, poor scattered sons of Abraham, than the Inquisition itself.\" Cumberland later wrote a successful play, \"The Jew\" (1794), in which his title character, Sheva, is portrayed sympathetically, as both a kindhearted and generous man. This was the first known attempt by a dramatist to reverse the negative stereotype that Shylock personified.\nThe depiction of Jews in literature throughout the centuries bears the close imprint of Shylock. With slight variations much of English literature up until the 20th century depicts the Jew as \"a monied, cruel, lecherous, avaricious outsider tolerated only because of his golden hoard\".\nShylock as a sympathetic character.\nMany modern readers and theatregoers have read the play as a plea for tolerance, noting that Shylock is a sympathetic character. They cite as evidence that Shylock's \"trial\" at the end of the play is a mockery of justice, with Portia acting as a judge when she has no right to do so. The characters who berated Shylock for dishonesty resort to trickery in order to win. In addition to this, Shakespeare gives Shylock one of his most eloquent speeches:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\nSALARINO: Why, I am sure if he forfeit, thou wilt not\ntake his flesh! What's that good for?\nSHYLOCK: To bait fish withal; if it will feed nothing else,\nit will feed my revenge. He hath disgraced me and\nhindered me half a million, laughed at my losses,\nmocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted\nmy bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine enemies\u2014\nand what's his reason? I am a Jew. Hath not\na Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions,\nsenses, affections, passions? Fed with the\nsame food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to\nthe same diseases, healed by the same means,\nwarmed and cooled by the same winter and summer\nas a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not\nbleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you\npoison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall\nwe not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will\nresemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian,\nwhat is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian wrong\na Jew, what should his sufferance be by Christian\nexample? Why, revenge! The villainy you teach me I\nwill execute, and it shall go hard but I will better the\ninstruction.&lt;/poem&gt;\u2014\u200a\nIt is uncertain whether the sympathetic reading of Shylock is due to changing sensibilities among readers or that Shakespeare, a writer who created complex, multi-faceted characters, deliberately intended this reading. Stephen Greenblatt points out that, though Shylock is not a \"lovable alien\", he is given \"more theatrical vitality, quite simply more urgent, compelling life, than anyone else in his world\".\nOne basis for this interpretation is the emphasis on Shylock's marginalized position within Venetian society. Some critics regard his well-known \"Hath not a Jew eyes?\" speech as a redeeming moment that lends him qualities of a tragic figure. In this speech, Shylock contends that he is fundamentally no different from the Christian characters. Critics who dispute a sympathetic reading of the speech note that it concludes with a call for revenge: \"if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?\" Those who view the passage more sympathetically emphasize that Shylock attributes his desire for retribution to the example set by the Christian characters: \"If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by Christian example? Why, revenge. The villainy you teach me, I will execute, and it shall go hard but I will better the instruction.\"\nEven if Shakespeare did not intend the play to be read this way, the fact that it retains its power on stage for audiences who may perceive its central conflicts in radically different terms is an illustration of the subtlety of Shakespeare's characterisations. Additionally, when Shylock discovers that his daughter, Jessica, has sold his ring, a gift from his wife Leah, the audience is provided with sympathetic biographical information tangential to the plot.\nLater, in the trial Shylock represents what Elizabethan Christians believed to be the Jewish desire for \"justice\", contrasted with their obviously superior Christian value of mercy. The Christians in the courtroom urge Shylock to love his enemies, although they themselves have failed in the past. Jewish critic Harold Bloom suggests that, although the play gives merit to both cases, the portraits are not even-handed: \"Shylock's shrewd indictment of Christian hypocrisy delights us, but ... Shakespeare's intimations do not alleviate the savagery of his portrait of the Jew...\"\nNotably, in Nazi Germany, concerns arose that the portrayal of Shylock would elicit too much sympathy for the plight of a Jewish person, thus prompting many alterations to the play, including the excision of Shylock's final speech.\nAntonio, Bassanio.\nAntonio's unexplained depression \u2013 \"In sooth I know not why I am so sad\" \u2013 and utter devotion to Bassanio has led some critics to theorise that he is suffering from unrequited love for Bassanio and is depressed because Bassanio is coming to an age where he will marry a woman. In his plays and poetry Shakespeare often depicted strong male bonds of varying homosociality, which has led some critics to infer that Bassanio returns Antonio's affections despite his obligation to marry:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\nANTONIO [...]\nCommend me to your honorable wife,\nTell her the process of Antonio's end,\nSay how I loved you, speak me fair in death,\nAnd when the tale is told, bid her be judge\nWhether Bassanio had not once a love.\nBASSANIO [...]\nBut life itself, my wife, and all the world\nAre not with me esteemed above thy life.\nI would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all\nHere to this devil, to deliver you.&lt;/poem&gt;\u2014\u200a\nIn his essay \"Brothers and Others\", published in \"The Dyer's Hand\", W. H. Auden describes Antonio as \"a man whose emotional life, though his conduct may be chaste, is concentrated upon a member of his own sex.\" Antonio's feelings for Bassanio are likened to a couplet from Shakespeare's \"Sonnets\": \"But since she pricked thee out for women's pleasure,/ Mine be thy love, and my love's use their treasure.\" Antonio, says Auden, embodies the words on Portia's leaden casket: \"Who chooseth me, must give and hazard all he hath.\" Antonio has taken this potentially fatal turn because he despairs, not only over the loss of Bassanio in marriage but also because Bassanio cannot requite what Antonio feels for him. Antonio's frustrated devotion is a form of idolatry: the right to live is yielded for the sake of the loved one. There is one other such idolator in the play: Shylock himself. \"Shylock, however unintentionally, did, in fact, hazard all for the sake of destroying the enemy he hated, and Antonio, however unthinkingly he signed the bond, hazarded all to secure the happiness of the man he loved.\" Both Antonio and Shylock, agreeing to put Antonio's life at a forfeit, stand outside the normal bounds of society. There was, states Auden, a traditional \"association of sodomy with usury\", reaching back at least as far as Dante, with which Shakespeare was likely familiar. (Auden sees the theme of usury in the play as a comment on human relations in a mercantile society.)\nOther interpreters of the play regard Auden's conception of Antonio's sexual desire for Bassanio as questionable. Michael Radford, director of the 2004 film version starring Al Pacino, explained that, although the film contains a scene where Antonio and Bassanio actually kiss, the friendship between them is platonic, in line with the prevailing view of male friendship at the time. Jeremy Irons, in an interview, concurs with the director's view and states that he did not \"play Antonio as gay\". Joseph Fiennes, however, who plays Bassanio, encouraged a homoerotic interpretation and, in fact, surprised Irons with the kiss on set, which was filmed in one take. Fiennes defended his choice, saying \"I would never invent something before doing my detective work in the text. If you look at the choice of language ... you'll read very sensuous language. That's the key for me in the relationship. The great thing about Shakespeare and why he's so difficult to pin down is his ambiguity. He's not saying they're gay or they're straight, he's leaving it up to his actors. I feel there has to be a great love between the two characters ... there's great attraction. I don't think they have slept together but that's for the audience to decide.\"The literary critic Hollis Robbins has suggested that his melancholy is economic in nature, as decline in Venetian shipping monopolies made voyages far more risky.\nPerformance history.\nThe earliest performance of which a record has survived was held at the court of King James in the spring of 1605, followed by a second performance a few days later, but there is no record of any further performances in the 17th century. In 1701, George Granville staged a successful adaptation, titled \"The Jew of Venice\", with Thomas Betterton as Bassanio. This version, which featured a masque (\"The Masque of Peleus and Thetis\") was popular, and was acted for the next forty years. Granville cut the clownish Gobbos in line with neoclassical decorum; he added a jail scene between Shylock and Antonio; an extended scene of toasting at a banquet scene, and had Bassanio give Portia his ring when she is disguised as a male lawyer, removing any homosexual subtext that could be inferred from that scene in the original play. Thomas Doggett was Shylock, playing the role comically, perhaps even farcically. Rowe expressed doubts about this interpretation as early as 1709; Doggett's success in the role meant that later productions would feature the troupe clown as Shylock.\nIn 1741, Charles Macklin returned to the original text in a very successful production at Drury Lane, paving the way for Edmund Kean seventy years later (see below).\nArthur Sullivan wrote incidental music for the play in 1871. As part of the 500 year anniversary of the Venetian Ghetto, which converged with the 400 year anniversary of Shakespeare's death, \"The Merchant of Venice\" was performed in the ghetto main square in 2016 by the Compagnia de' Colombari.\nShylock on stage.\nJewish actor Jacob Adler and others report that the tradition of playing Shylock sympathetically began in the first half of the 19th century with Edmund Kean, and that previously the role had been played \"by a comedian as a repulsive clown or, alternatively, as a monster of unrelieved evil.\" Kean's Shylock established his reputation as an actor.\nFrom Kean's time forward, all of the actors who have famously played the role, with the exception of Edwin Booth, who played Shylock as a simple villain, have chosen a sympathetic approach to the character; even Booth's father, Junius Brutus Booth, played the role sympathetically. Henry Irving's portrayal of an aristocratic, proud Shylock (first seen at the Lyceum in 1879, with Portia played by Ellen Terry) has been called \"the summit of his career\". Jacob Adler was the most notable of the early 20th century: Adler played the role in Yiddish-language translation, first in Manhattan's Yiddish Theatre District on the Lower East Side, and later on Broadway, where, to great acclaim, he performed the role in Yiddish in an otherwise English-language production.\nKean and Irving presented a Shylock justified in wanting his revenge; Adler's Shylock evolved over the years he played the role, first as a stock Shakespearean villain, then as a man whose better nature was overcome by a desire for revenge, and finally as a man who operated not from revenge but from pride. In a 1902 interview with \"Theater\" magazine, Adler pointed out that Shylock is a wealthy man, \"rich enough to forgo the interest on three thousand ducats\" and that Antonio is \"far from the chivalrous gentleman he is made to appear. He has insulted the Jew and spat on him, yet he comes with hypocritical politeness to borrow money of him.\" Shylock's fatal flaw is to depend on the law, but \"would he not walk out of that courtroom head erect, the very apotheosis of defiant hatred and scorn?\"\nSome modern productions take further pains to show the sources of Shylock's thirst for vengeance. For instance, in the 2004 film adaptation directed by Michael Radford and starring Al Pacino as Shylock, the film begins with text and a montage of how Venetian Jews are cruelly abused by bigoted Christians. One of the last shots of the film also brings attention to the fact that, as a convert, Shylock would have been cast out of the Jewish community in Venice, no longer allowed to live in the ghetto. Another interpretation of Shylock and a vision of how \"must he be acted\" appears at the conclusion of the autobiography of Alexander Granach, a noted Jewish stage and film actor in Weimar Germany (and later in Hollywood and on Broadway).\nAdaptations and cultural references.\nThe play has inspired many adaptions and several works of fiction.\nCultural references.\nEdmond Haraucourt, French playwright and poet, was commissioned in the 1880s by the actor and theatrical director Paul Porel to make a French-verse adaptation of \"The Merchant of Venice\". His play \"Shylock\", first performed at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Od\u00e9on in December 1889, had incidental music by the French composer Gabriel Faur\u00e9, later incorporated into an orchestral suite of the same name.\nSt. John Ervine wrote a sequel play, \"The Lady of Belmont\", in 1924, in which the characters from Shakespeare's work reunite ten years after the events of the earlier play.\nRalph Vaughan Williams' choral work \"Serenade to Music\" (1938) draws its text from the discussion about music and the music of the spheres in act V, scene 1.\nIn both versions of the comic film \"To Be or Not to Be\" (1942 and 1983) the character \"Greenberg\", specified as a Jew in the later version, gives a recitation of the \"Hath not a Jew eyes?\" speech to Nazi soldiers.\nThe rock musical \"Fire Angel\" was based on the story of the play, with the scene changed to the Little Italy district of New York. It was performed in Edinburgh in 1974 and in a revised form at Her Majesty's Theatre, London, in 1977. Braham Murray directed.\nArnold Wesker's play \"The Merchant\" (1976) is a reimagining of Shakespeare's story. In this retelling, Shylock and Antonio are friends and share a disdain for the crass anti-Semitism of the Christian community's laws.\nDavid Henry Wilson's play \"Shylock's Revenge\", was first produced at the University of Hamburg in 1989, and follows the events in \"The Merchant of Venice\". In this play Shylock gets his wealth back and becomes a Jew again.\nThe \"Star Trek\" franchise sometimes quote and paraphrase Shakespeare, including \"The Merchant of Venice\". One example is the Shakespeare-aficionado Chang in \"\" (1991), a Klingon, who quotes Shylock.\nSteven Spielberg's \"Schindler's List\" (1993) depicts SS Lieutenant Amon G\u00f6th quoting Shylock's \"Hath not a Jew eyes?\" speech when deciding whether to rape his Jewish maid.\nIn David Fincher's 1995 crime thriller \"Seven\", a lawyer, Eli Gould, is coerced to remove a pound of his own flesh and place it on a scale, alluding to the play.\nThe German Belmont Prize was established in 1997, referring to 'Belmont' as \"a place of destiny where Portia's intelligence is at home.\" The eligibility for the award is encapsulated by the inscription on the play's lead casket, \"Who chooses me must give and hazard all he hath.\"\nOne of the four short stories comprising Alan Isler's \"The Bacon Fancier\" (1999) is also told from Shylock's point of view. In this story, Antonio was a converted Jew.\n\"The Pianist\" is a 2002 film based on a memoir by W\u0142adys\u0142aw Szpilman. In this film, Henryk Szpilman reads Shylock's \"Hath not a Jew eyes?\" speech to his brother W\u0142adys\u0142aw in the Warsaw Ghetto during the Nazi occupation in World War II.\nIn the 2009 spy comedy \"\", a speech by the Nazi Von Zimmel parodies Shylock's tirade.\nChristopher Moore combines \"The Merchant of Venice\" and \"Othello\" in his 2014 comic novel \"The Serpent of Venice\", in which he makes Portia (from \"The Merchant of Venice\") and Desdemona (from \"Othello\") sisters. All of the characters come from those two plays with the exception of Jeff (a monkey); the gigantic simpleton Drool; and Pocket, the Fool, who comes from Moore's earlier novel \"Fool\", based on \"King Lear\".\nNaomi Alderman's \"The Wolf in the Water\" is a radio-play first broadcast on BBC Radio 3 in 2016. The play continues the story of Shylock's daughter Jessica, who lives in an anti-semitic Venice and practices her Jewish faith in secret. Part of the BBC's Shakespeare Festival, the play also marked that 500 years had passed since the Venetian Ghetto was instituted.\nSarah B. Mantell's \"Everything that Never Happened\" is a play first produced in 2017 at the Yale School of Drama. Similar to \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead\", the play occurs in the gaps between scenes of the canonical \"The Merchant of Venice\", with the characters gradually recognizing how conflicts over assimilation and anti-Semitism recur throughout past, present, and future.\nNotes and references.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was designed by NPO Energia of the Soviet Union as part of the Buran program for a variety of payloads including the Buran spacecraft. Control system main developer enterprise was the Khartron NPO \"Electropribor\". The Energia used four strap-on boosters each powered by a four-chamber RD-170 engine burning kerosene/LOX, and a central core stage with four single-chamber RD-0120 (11D122) engines fueled by liquid hydrogen/LOX.\nThe launch vehicle had two functionally different operational variants: Energia-Polyus, the initial test configuration, in which the Polyus system was used as a final stage intended to put the payload into orbit, and Energia-Buran, in which the \"Buran\" orbiter was the payload and the source of the orbit insertion impulse.\nThe launch vehicle had the capacity to place about 100 tonnes in Low Earth orbit, up to 20 tonnes to geostationary orbit and up to 32 tonnes by translunar trajectory into lunar orbit.\nThe launch vehicle made just two flights before being discontinued. Since 2016, there have been attempts to revive the launch vehicle, reusing an updated version of its booster engine in the Soyuz-5 rocket.\nDevelopment history.\nWork on the Energia/Buran system began in 1976 after the decision was made to cancel the unsuccessful N1 rocket. The facilities and infrastructure built for the N1 were reused for Energia (notably the huge horizontal assembly building), just as NASA reused infrastructure designed for the Saturn V in the Space Shuttle program. Energia also replaced the \"Vulkan\" concept, which was a design based on the Proton and using the same hypergolic propellants, but much larger and more powerful. The \"Vulkan\" designation was later given to a variation of the Energia which has eight boosters and multiple stages.\nThe Energia was designed to launch the Soviet \"Buran\" reusable shuttle, and for that reason was designed to carry its payload mounted on the side of the stack, rather than on the top, as is done with other launch vehicles. Design of the Energia-Buran system assumed that the booster could be used without the Buran orbiter, as a heavy-lift cargo launch vehicle; this configuration was originally given the name \"Buran-T\". This configuration required the addition of an upper stage to perform the final orbital insertion. The first launch of the Energia was in the configuration of a heavy launch vehicle, with the large Polyus military satellite as a payload, however Polyus failed to correctly perform the orbital insertion.\nDue to the termination of the Buran program the Energia program was concluded after only two launches. The legacy of Energia/Buran project manifests itself in the RD-170 family of rocket engines, and the Zenit launcher, with the first stage roughly the same as one of the Energia first-stage boosters.\nBlock A first stage.\nThe first stage, Block A was four strap-on boosters weighing in at 340 tons with fuel included. The boosters had a burn time of 156 seconds from takeoff. They used one RD-170 engine for each booster, four in total. Each booster was 40 meters (131.2 ft) tall and 3.9 meters (12.7 ft) wide. The stage used kerosene as fuel. \nThe boosters' thrust was 7,906.100 kN in a vacuum.\nBlock Ts second stage.\nThe second stage, Block Ts was the core/center stage of the rocket weighing in at about 50 tons with fuel included. The stage had a burn time of 470 seconds from takeoff. They had used 4 one-chamber RD-O120 engines. The stage was 59 meters (193.5 ft) tall and 7.75 meters (24.4 ft) wide. The center used liquid hydrogen as fuel instead of the kerosene used in the boosters. \nThe core stage had 7,848.124 kN of thrust in a vacuum.\nLaunch history.\nFirst launch (Energia\u2013Polyus).\nThe Energia was first test-launched on 15 May 1987, with the Polyus spacecraft as the payload. An FGB (\"functional cargo block\") engine section originally built as a cancelled Mir module was incorporated into the upper stage used to insert the payload into orbit, similarly to Buran and the US Space Shuttle performing the final orbital insertion, since the planned \"Buran-T\" upper stage had not yet progressed beyond the planning stage. The intended orbit had 280\u00a0km (170\u00a0mi) altitude and 64.6\u00b0 inclination.\nThe Soviets had originally announced that the launch was a successful sub-orbital test of the new Energia booster with a dummy payload, but sometime later it was revealed that in fact the flight had been intended to bring the Polyus into orbit. The two stages of the Energia launcher functioned as designed, but due to a software error in its attitude control system, Polyus's orbital insertion motor failed to inject the payload into orbit. Instead, the Polyus reentered the atmosphere over the Pacific Ocean.\nSecond launch (Energia\u2013Buran).\nThe second flight, and the first one where payload successfully reached orbit, was launched on 15 November 1988. This mission launched the uncrewed Soviet Shuttle vehicle Buran. At apogee, the Buran spacecraft made a 66.7\u00a0m/s burn to reach a final orbit of 251\u00a0km \u00d7 263\u00a0km.\nDiscontinuation and potential revival.\nProduction of Energia rockets ended with the end of the Buran shuttle project in the late 1980s, and more certainly, with the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. Since that time, there have been persistent rumors of the renewal of production, but given the political realities, that is highly unlikely. \nWhile the Energia is no longer in production, the Zenit boosters were in use until 2017. The four strap-on liquid-fuel boosters, which burned kerosene and liquid oxygen, were the basis of the Zenit rocket which used the same engines. The engine is the four combustion chamber RD-170. Its derivative, the RD-171, was used on the Zenit rocket. A half-sized derivative of the engine, the two-chamber RD-180, powers Lockheed Martin's Atlas V rocket, while the single-chamber derivative, the RD-191, has been used to launch the Korean Naro-1 (as a reduced-thrust variant named the RD-151) and the Russian Angara rocket. The RD-181, based on the RD-191, is used on the Antares rocket.\nIn August 2016, Roscosmos announced conceptual plans to develop a super heavy-lift launch vehicle from existing Energia components (particularly the RD-171 engine for side boosters) instead of pushing the less-powerful Angara A5V project. This would allow Russia to launch missions towards establishing a permanent Moon base with simpler logistics, launching just one or two 80\u2013160-ton super-heavy rockets instead of four 40-ton Angara A5Vs implying quick-sequence launches and multiple in-orbit rendezvous.\nTests of RD-171MV engine, an updated version of the engine used in Energia, were completed in September 2021 and may potentially be used in the successor Soyuz-5 rocket.\nProposed variants.\nThree major design variants were conceptualized after the original configuration, each with vastly different payloads.\nEnergia-M.\nThe Energia-M was an early-1990s design configuration and the smallest of the three. The number of boosters was reduced from four to two, the core stage was shortened and fitted with just one RD-0120 engine. It was designed to replace the Proton rocket, but lost a 1993 competition to the Angara rocket.\nA non-functional prototype (\"structural test vehicle\") of the Energia M still exists in the Dynamic Test Stand facility at Baikonur Cosmodrome.\nEnergia-2 (GK-175).\nEnergia-2 was an evolution of the Energia studied in the 1980s. Unlike the Energia-Buran, which was planned to be semi-reusable (like the U.S. Space Shuttle), the GK-175 concept was to have allowed the recovery and reuse of all elements of the vehicle, similarly to the original, fully reusable Orbiter/Booster concept of the U.S. Shuttle. The Energia-2 core as proposed would be capable of re-entering and gliding to a landing.\nVulkan.\nThe final never-built design concept was also the largest. With eight Zenit booster rockets and an Energia-M core as the upper stage, the Vulkan (which shared the name with another Soviet heavy lift rocket that was cancelled years earlier) configuration was initially projected to launch up to 200\u00a0metric tonnes into 200 km orbit with inclination 50.7\u00b0.\nThe development of the Vulkan and the refurbishment of Universal Test Stand and Launch Pad at site 250 for its launches was in progress between 1990\u20131993 and abandoned soon after due to a lack of funds and the collapse of the Soviet Union.\nComparison with the Space Shuttle.\nThe Energia rocket was created as a response to the Americans building the Space Shuttle and was heavily based off the already designed Space Shuttle. While the Shuttle was made as a cheaper alternative for spaceflight, the Russians were paranoid about its use as a military weapon and responded by designing and building Energia-Buran. \nThe Space Shuttle could only bring a maximum 30 tonnes to LEO, but the Energia could bring a maximum 100 tonnes to LEO. This makes the Space Shuttle a heavy-lift launch vehicle and the Energia a super-heavy lift launch vehicle.\nThe Space Shuttle program lasted 30 years, operating from 1981 to 2011. The Energia program began in 1976 and after its only two launches officially ended in 1993 and in total operated for 17 years.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In modern notation, it signifies a note of shortened duration, separated from the note that may follow by silence. It has been described by theorists and has appeared in music since at least 1676.\nNotation.\nIn 20th-century music, a dot placed above or below a note indicates that it should be played staccato, and a wedge is used for the more emphatic staccatissimo. However, before 1850, dots, dashes, and wedges were all likely to have the same meaning, even though some theorists from as early as the 1750s distinguished different degrees of staccato through the use of dots and dashes, with the dash indicating a shorter, sharper note, and the dot a longer, lighter one.\nA number of signs came to be used in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to discriminate more subtle nuances of staccato. These signs involve various combinations of dots, vertical and horizontal dashes, vertical and horizontal wedges, and the like, but attempts to standardize these signs have not generally been successful.\nThe example below illustrates the scope of the staccato dot:\n&lt;score&gt; {\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n \u00ab \\clef treble\n \\relative c' {\n \\stemNeutral &lt;e c'&gt;-. &lt;g d'&gt;-. &lt;g e'&gt;-. &lt;c, c'&gt;-.\n \\stemUp a'-. c-. c-. d-.\n s1\n f'4 f' g' g'\n \u00bb\n&lt;/score&gt;\nIn the first measure, the pairs of notes are in the same musical part (or voice) since they are on a common stem. The staccato applies to both notes of the pairs. In the second measure, the pairs of notes are stemmed separately indicating two different parts, so the staccato applies only to the upper note.\nThe opposite musical articulation of staccato is legato, signifying long and continuous notes. There is an intermediate articulation called either mezzo staccato or non legato.\nFor wind and bowed string instruments in particular, staccato is often also associated with a faster attack, potentially involving a different bowing or tonguing technique as appropriate.\nStaccatissimo.\nIn musical notation, staccatissimo (plural: \"staccatissimi\" or the anglicised form \"staccatissimos\") indicates that the notes are to be played extremely separated and distinct, a superlative staccato. This can be notated with little pikes over or under the notes, depending on stem direction, as in this example from Bruckner's Symphony No. 0 in D minor:\n &lt;score&gt;\n\\new Score {\n \\new Staff {\n \\relative c' {\n \\time 3/4\n \\key d \\minor\n \\clef treble\n d8-&gt;(\\ff cis d2~\n d4) a'-! d-!\n es-! e-! f-!\n fis-! g-! gis-!\n a8(-&gt; gis a4)\n&lt;/score&gt;\nAlternatively, it can be notated by writing the word \"staccatissimo\" or the abbreviation \"staccatiss.\" over the staff. A few composers, such as Mozart, have used staccato dots accompanied by a written instruction \"staccatissimo\" when they mean the passage to be played \"staccatissimo\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "37721", "revid": "96249", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37721", "title": "Legato", "text": "Indicates that musical notes are played or sung smoothly and connected\n&lt;score&gt; {\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \\relative c\" { a4( b c d e f g a) } }&lt;/score&gt; A slurred A-minor natural scale. The slur indicates that the scale is played legato.\nIn music performance and notation, legato (; Italian for \"tied together\"; French \"li\u00e9\"; German \"gebunden\") indicates that musical notes are played or sung smoothly, such that the transition from note to note is made with no intervening silence. Legato technique is required for slurred performance, but unlike slurring (as that term is interpreted for some instruments), legato does not forbid articulating the notes with a very slight interruption.\nStandard notation indicates legato either with the word \"legato\", or by a slur (a curved line) under notes that form one legato group. The latter notation is differentiated from a tie in that the notes have different pitches. Legato, like staccato, is a kind of articulation.\nThere is an intermediate articulation called either \"mezzo staccato\" or \"non-legato\" (sometimes referred to as \"portato\").\nClassical string instruments.\nIn music for Classical string instruments, legato is an articulation that often refers to notes played with a full bow, and played with the shortest silence, often barely perceptible, between notes. The player achieves this through controlled wrist movements of the bowing hand, often masked or enhanced with vibrato. Such a legato style of playing can also be associated with portamento.\nGuitar.\nIn guitar playing (apart from classical guitar) legato is used interchangeably as a label for both musical articulation and a particular application of technique\u2014playing musical phrases using the fretting hand to play the notes\u2014using techniques such as glissando, string bending, hammer-ons and pull-offs instead of picking to sound the notes. The fact that the same finger is both setting the string vibrating and setting the pitch leads to smoother transitions between notes than when one hand is used to mark pitch while the other strikes the string. Legato \"technique\" to provide legato \"articulation\" on electric guitar generally requires playing notes that are close and on the same string, following the first note with others that are played by hammer-ons and pull-offs. \nSome guitar virtuosos (notably Allan Holdsworth, Shawn Lane and Brett Garsed) developed their legato technique to the extent that they could perform extremely complex passages involving any permutation of notes on a string at extreme tempos, and particularly in the case of Holdsworth, tend to eschew pull-offs entirely for what some feel is a detrimental effect on guitar tone as the string is pulled slightly sideways. The term \"hammer-ons from nowhere\" is commonly employed when crossing strings and relying solely on fretting hand strength to produce a note but on a plucked string. Many guitar virtuosos are well-versed in the legato technique, as it allows for rapid and \"clean\" runs. Multiple hammer-ons and pull-offs together are sometimes also referred to colloquially as \"rolls\", a reference to the fluid sound of the technique. A rapid series of hammer-ons and pull-offs between a single pair of notes is called a trill. \nLegato on guitar is commonly associated with playing more notes within a beat than the stated timing, i.e., playing 5 (a quintuplet) or 7 (a septuplet) notes against a quarter-note instead of the usual even number or triplet. This gives the passage an unusual timing and when played slowly an unusual sound. However, this is less noticeable by ear when played fast, as legato usually is. There is a fine line between legato and two-hand finger tapping, in some cases making the two techniques harder to distinguish by ear. Generally, legato adds a more fluid, smooth sound to a passage.\nSynthesizers.\nIn synthesizers legato is a type of monophonic operation. In contrast to the typical monophonic mode where every new note articulates the sound by restarting the envelope generators, in legato mode the envelopes are not re-triggered if the new note is played \"legato\" (with the previous note still depressed). This causes the initial transient from the attack and decay phases to sound only once for an entire legato sequence of notes. Envelopes reaching the sustain stage remain there until the final note is released.\nVocal music.\nIn classical singing, legato means a string of sustained vowels with minimal interruption from consonants. It is a key characteristic of the bel canto singing style that prevailed among voice teachers and singers during the 18th century and the first four decades of the 19th century. Usually referred to as \"the line\", a good, smooth legato is still necessary for successful classical singers. In Western Classical vocal music, singers generally use it on any phrase without explicit articulation marks. Usually the most prevalent issue with vocal legato is maintaining the \"line\" across registers. \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The octave relationship is a natural phenomenon that has been referred to as the \"basic miracle of music\", the use of which is \"common in most musical systems\". The interval between the first and second harmonics of the harmonic series is an octave. In Western music notation, notes separated by an octave (or multiple octaves) have the same name and are of the same pitch class.\nTo emphasize that it is one of the perfect intervals (including unison, perfect fourth, and perfect fifth), the octave is designated P8. Other interval qualities are also possible, though rare. The octave above or below an indicated note is sometimes abbreviated \"8a\" or \"8va\" (), \"8va bassa\" (, sometimes also \"8vb\"), or simply \"8\" for the octave in the direction indicated by placing this mark above or below the staff.\nExplanation and definition.\nAn octave is the interval between one musical pitch and another with double or half its frequency. For example, if one note has a frequency of 440\u00a0Hz, the note one octave above is at 880\u00a0Hz, and the note one octave below is at 220\u00a0Hz. The ratio of frequencies of two notes an octave apart is therefore 2:1. Further octaves of a note occur at formula_1 times the frequency of that note (where \"n\" is an integer), such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. and the reciprocal of that series. For example, 55\u00a0Hz and 440\u00a0Hz are one and two octaves away from 110\u00a0Hz because they are &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;+1\u20442 (or formula_2) and 4 (or formula_3) times the frequency, respectively.\nThe number of octaves between two frequencies is given by the formula: formula_4\nMusic theory.\nMost musical scales are written so that they begin and end on notes that are an octave apart. For example, the C major scale is typically written C D E F G A B C (shown below), the initial and final Cs being an octave apart.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nBecause of octave equivalence, notes in a chord that are one or more octaves apart are said to be \"doubled\" (even if there are \"more\" than two notes in different octaves) in the chord. The word is also used to describe melodies played in parallel one or more octaves apart (see example under Equivalence, below).\nWhile octaves commonly refer to the perfect octave (P8), the interval of an octave in music theory encompasses chromatic alterations within the pitch class, meaning that G\u266e to G\u266f (13 semitones higher) is an augmented octave (A8), and G\u266e to G\u266d (11 semitones higher) is a diminished octave (d8). The use of such intervals is rare, as there is frequently a preferable enharmonically-equivalent notation available (minor ninth and major seventh respectively), but these categories of octaves must be acknowledged in any full understanding of the role and meaning of octaves more generally in music.\nNotation.\nOctave of a pitch.\nOctaves are identified with various naming systems. Among the most common are the scientific, Helmholtz, organ pipe, and MIDI note systems. In scientific pitch notation, a specific octave is indicated by a numerical subscript number after note name. In this notation, middle C is C4, because of the note's position as the fourth C key on a standard 88-key piano keyboard, while the C an octave higher is C5.\n\"Ottava alta\" and \"bassa\".\n&lt;score lang=\"lilypond\"&gt; {\n\\relative c' {\n \\clef treble \n \\time 4/4\n \\key c \\major\n c4 e g2\n \\ottava #-1 c,4 e g2\n \\ottava #-2 c,4 e g2\n&lt;/score&gt; Similar example with \"8vb\" and \"15mb\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe notation \"8a\" or \"8va\" is sometimes seen in sheet music, meaning \"play this an octave higher than written\" (\"all' ottava\": \"at the octave\" or \"all' 8va\"). \"8a\" or \"8va\" stands for \"ottava\", the Italian word for octave (or \"eighth\"); the octave above may be specified as \"ottava alta\" or \"ottava sopra\"). Sometimes \"8va\" is used to tell the musician to play a passage an octave \"lower\" (when placed under rather than over the staff), though the similar notation \"8vb\" (\"ottava bassa\" or \"ottava sotto\") is also used. Similarly, \"15ma\" (\"quindicesima\") means \"play two octaves higher than written\" and \"15mb\" (\"quindicesima bassa\") means \"play two octaves lower than written.\"\nThe abbreviations \"col 8\", \"coll' 8\", and \"c. 8va\" stand for \"coll'ottava\", meaning \"with the octave\", i.e. to play the notes in the passage together with the notes in the notated octaves. Any of these directions can be cancelled with the word \"loco\", but often a dashed line or bracket indicates the extent of the music affected.\nEquivalence.\n&lt;score sound=\"1\"&gt; {\n\\relative c' {\n \\clef treble \n \\time 4/4\n \\key c \\major\n &lt;c c'&gt;4^\\markup { \"(1) Parallel octaves (doubled)\" } &lt;c c'&gt; &lt;g' g'&gt; &lt;g g'&gt; &lt;g g'&gt;2 \n &lt;f f'&gt;4 &lt;f f'&gt; &lt;e e'&gt; &lt;e e'&gt; &lt;d d'&gt; &lt;d d'&gt; &lt;c c'&gt;2\n&lt;/score&gt;\n&lt;score sound=\"1\"&gt; {\n\\relative c' {\n \\clef treble \n \\time 4/4\n \\key c \\major\n &lt;c g'&gt;4^\\markup { \"(2) Parallel fifths\" } &lt;c g'&gt; &lt;g' d'&gt; &lt;g d'&gt; &lt;g d'&gt;2 \n &lt;f c'&gt;4 &lt;f c'&gt; &lt;e b'&gt; &lt;e b'&gt; &lt;d a'&gt; &lt;d a'&gt; &lt;c g'&gt;2\n&lt;/score&gt;\n&lt;score sound=\"1\"&gt; {\n\\relative c' {\n \\clef treble \n \\time 4/4\n \\key c \\major\n &lt;c d&gt;4^\\markup { \"(3) Parallel seconds\" } &lt;c d&gt; &lt;g' a&gt; &lt;g a&gt; &lt;g a&gt;2 \n &lt;f g&gt;4 &lt;f g&gt; &lt;e f&gt; &lt;e f&gt; &lt;d e&gt; &lt;d e&gt; &lt;c d&gt;2\n&lt;/score&gt; Demonstration of octave equivalence. The melody to \"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star\" with parallel harmony. The melody is paralleled in three ways: (1) in octaves (consonant and equivalent); (2) in fifths (fairly consonant but not equivalent); and (3) in seconds (neither consonant nor equivalent).\nAfter the unison, the octave is the simplest interval in music. The human ear tends to hear both notes as being essentially \"the same\", due to closely related harmonics. Notes separated by an octave \"ring\" together, adding a pleasing sound to music. The interval is so natural to humans that when men and women are asked to sing in unison, they typically sing in octave.\nFor this reason, notes an octave apart are given the same note name in the Western system of music notation\u2014the name of a note an octave above A is also A. This is called \"octave equivalence\", the assumption that pitches one or more octaves apart are musically equivalent in many ways, leading to the convention \"that scales are uniquely defined by specifying the intervals within an octave\". The conceptualization of pitch as having two dimensions, pitch height (absolute frequency) and pitch class (relative position within the octave), inherently include octave circularity. Thus all C\u266fs (or all 1s, if C\u00a0=\u00a00), any number of octaves apart, are part of the same pitch class.\nOctave equivalence is a part of most musical cultures, but is far from universal in \"primitive\" and early music. The languages in which the oldest extant written documents on tuning are written, Sumerian and Akkadian, have no known word for \"octave\". However, it is believed that a set of cuneiform tablets that collectively describe the tuning of a nine-stringed instrument, believed to be a Babylonian lyre, describe tunings for seven of the strings, with indications to tune the remaining two strings an octave from two of the seven tuned strings. Leon Crickmore recently proposed that \"The octave may not have been thought of as a unit in its own right, but rather by analogy like the first day of a new seven-day week.\"\nMonkeys experience octave equivalence, and its biological basis apparently is an octave mapping of neurons in the auditory thalamus of the mammalian brain. Studies have also shown the perception of octave equivalence in rats, human infants, and musicians but not starlings, 4\u20139-year-old children, or non-musicians.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources"}

She was developed by Joss Whedon and portrayed throughout the TV series by Alyson Hannigan.\nWillow plays an integral role within the inner circle of friends\u2014called the Scooby Gang\u2014who support Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar), a teenager gifted with superhuman powers to defeat vampires, demons, and other evil in the fictional town of Sunnydale. The series begins as Buffy, Willow, and their friend Xander (Nicholas Brendon) are in 10th grade and Willow is a shy, nerdy girl with little confidence. She has inherent magical abilities and begins to study witchcraft; as the series progresses, Willow becomes more sure of herself and her magical powers become significant. Her dependence on magic becomes so consuming that it develops into a dark force that takes her on a redemptive journey in a major story arc when she becomes the sixth season's main villain, threatening to destroy the world in a fit of grief and rage.\nThe \"Buffy\" series became extremely popular and earned a devoted fanbase; Willow's intelligence, shy nature, and vulnerability often resounded strongly with viewers in early seasons. Of the core characters, Willow changes the most, becoming a complex portrayal of a woman whose powers force her to seek balance between what is best for the people she loves and what she is capable of doing. Her character stood out as a positive portrayal of a Jewish woman and at the height of her popularity, she fell in love with another woman, a witch named Tara Maclay (Amber Benson). They became one of the first lesbian couples on American television and one of the most positive relationships of the series.\nDespite not being a titular character, Willow Rosenberg holds the distinction of having the second largest number of appearances on episodes of \"Buffy\" and the spin-off series \"Angel\". Alyson Hannigan appeared as Willow in all 144 episodes of \"Buffy\", as well as guest appearances in three episodes of the spinoff \"Angel\", for a total of 147 on-screen appearances over the course of both series. She is also featured in an animated series and video game, both of which use Hannigan's voice, and the comics \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight\" (2007\u20132011), \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine\" (2011\u20132013), \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Ten\" (2014\u20132016), \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eleven\" (2016\u20132017), and \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Twelve\" (2018) which use Hannigan's likeness and continues Willow's storyline following the television series.\nCharacter history.\nPilot and casting.\n\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" (often simplified as \"Buffy\") was originally conceived by Joss Whedon for a 1992 feature film. However, in its development Whedon felt it lost some of the quirkiness he considered was the heart of the project, and it was not received as well as he would have liked. He began to develop for television the concept of a fashion-conscious girl named Buffy, who is imbued with superhuman abilities and attends a high school situated on a portal to hell. Whedon created a group of friends for the main character, including Willow Rosenberg and Xander Harris. A half-hour pilot was filmed starring Riff Regan as Willow, but it was eventually left unaired and network executives requested that Regan be replaced. Willow's character demanded that she be shy and unsure of herself, and the casting department encountered some difficulty finding actors who could portray this effectively and still be likable. Melanie Lynskey turned down the role as she wasn't interested in TV acting at the time. After seven auditions, 23-year-old Alyson Hannigan was hired for the role. She was chosen for being able to spin the character's lines with a self-effacing optimism. She later stated in an interview, \"I didn't want to do Willow as someone who's feeling sorry for herself. Especially in the first season, she couldn't talk to guys, and nobody liked her. I was like, 'I don't want to play somebody who's down on herself.'\"\nIn the beginning of the series, Hannigan used her own experiences in high school\u2014which she called \"overwhelmingly depressing\"\u2014to guide her portrayal of Willow: \"My theory on high school was, get in, get out and hopefully I won't get hurt. Basically it was a miserable experience, because you're a walking hormone in this place that is just so cruel. There were times that were OK, but it's not the little myth that high school is the best years of your life. No way.\" Whedon intended Willow to be realistically introverted, saying, \"I wanted Willow to have that kind of insanely colorful interior life that truly shy people have. And Alyson has that. She definitely has a loopiness I found creeping into the way Willow talked, which was great. To an extent, all the actors conform to the way I write the character, but it really stands out in Willow's case.\"\nTelevision series (1997\u20132003).\nSeasons 1\u20133.\nThe \"Buffy\" television series first aired mid-season in March 1997, almost immediately earning positive critical reviews. Willow is presented as a bookish nerd with considerable computer skills, dowdily dressed and easily intimidated by more popular girls in school. She grows faint at the sight of monsters, but quickly forms a friendship with Buffy and is revealed to have grown up with Xander (Nicholas Brendon). They are mentored by the school librarian who is also Buffy's Watcher, Rupert Giles (Anthony Stewart Head), who often works closely with Willow in researching the various monsters the group encounters. Joss Whedon found that Hannigan was especially gifted reacting with fear (calling her the \"king of pain\") and viewers responded strongly when she was placed in danger, needing to be rescued by Buffy. Scenarios with Willow in various predicaments became common in early episodes. However, Willow establishes herself as integral to the group's effectiveness, often willing to break rules by hacking into highly secure computer systems.\nIn the second season when the characters are in 11th grade, Willow becomes more sure of herself, standing up to the conceited Cordelia Chase (Charisma Carpenter), and approaching Xander, on whom she has had a crush for years, although it is unrequited as Xander is in love with Buffy. Seth Green joined the cast during the second season as Oz, a high school senior who becomes a werewolf, and Willow's primary romantic interest. The show's popularity by early 1998 was evident to the cast members, and Hannigan remarked on her surprise specifically. Willow was noted to be the spirit of the Scooby Gang, and Hannigan attributed Willow's popularity with viewers (she had by May 1998 seven websites devoted to her) to being an underdog who develops confidence and is accepted by Buffy, a strong, popular person in school. Hannigan described her appeal: \"Willow is the only reality-based character. She really is what a lot of high-schoolers are like, with that awkwardness and shyness, and all those adolescent feelings.\"\nAt the end of the second season, Willow begins to study magic following the murder of the computer teacher and spell caster Jenny Calendar (Robia LaMorte). Willow is able to perform a complicated spell to restore the soul of Angel (David Boreanaz), a vampire who is also Calendar's murderer and Buffy's boyfriend. During the third season, episodes explore Willow's backstory and foreshadow her development. In \"Gingerbread\", her home life is made clearer: Sunnydale falls under the spell of a demon who throws the town's adults into a moral panic, and Willow's mother Sheila (Jordan Baker) is portrayed as a career-obsessed academic who is unable to communicate with her daughter, eventually trying to burn Willow at the stake for being involved in witchcraft; her father is never featured. In \"The Wish\" a vengeance demon named Anya (Emma Caulfield) grants Cordelia's wish that Buffy never came to Sunnydale, showing what would happen if it were overrun with vampires. In this alternate reality, Willow is an aggressively bisexual vampire. In a related episode, \"Doppelgangland\", Willow meets \"Vamp Willow\", who dresses provocatively and flirts with her.\nSeasons 4\u20136.\nWillow chooses to attend college with Buffy in Sunnydale although she is accepted to prestigious schools elsewhere. Her relationships with Buffy and Xander become strained as they try to find their place following high school. Willow becomes much more confident in college, finally finding a place that respects her intellect, while Buffy has difficulty in classes and Xander does not attend school. Willow's relationship with her boyfriend, Oz, continues until a female werewolf appears on the scene, aggressively pursuing him, and he leaves town to learn how to control the wolf within. She becomes depressed and explores magic more deeply, often with powerful but inconsistent results. She joins the campus Wicca group, meeting Tara Maclay, for whom she immediately feels a strong attraction. Willow adapts to her newfound sexual identity, eventually falling in love with and choosing to be with Tara, even when Oz returns to Sunnydale after apparently getting his lycanthropic tendencies under control.\nEach season the Scoobies face a villain they call the Big Bad. In the fifth season, this is a goddess named Glory (Clare Kramer) that Buffy is unable to fight by herself.\nThe writers of the series often use elements of fantasy and horror as metaphors for real-life conflicts. The series' use of magic, as noted by religion professor Gregory Stevenson, neither promotes nor denigrates Wiccan ideals and Willow rejects Wiccan colleagues for not practicing the magic she favors. Throughout the series, magic is employed to represent different ideas -\u2014 relationships, sexuality, ostracism, power, and particularly for Willow, addiction -\u2014 that change between episodes and seasons. The ethical judgment of magic, therefore, lies in the results: performing magic to meet selfish needs or neglecting to appreciate its power often ends disastrously. Using it wisely for altruistic reasons is considered a positive act on the series.\nThrough witchcraft, Willow becomes the only member of the group to cause damage to Glory. She reveals that the spells she casts are physically demanding, giving her headaches and nosebleeds. When Glory assaults Tara, making her insane, Willow, in a magical rage that causes her eyes to turn black, finds Glory and battles her. She does not come from the battle unscathed (after all, Glory is a goddess and Willow \"just\" a very powerful witch) and must be assisted by Buffy, but her power is evident and surprising to her friends. The final episode of the fifth season sees Willow restoring Tara's sanity and crucially weakening Glory in the process. It also features Buffy's death, sacrificing herself to save the world.\nWillow and Tara move into the Summers house and raise Buffy's younger sister Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg). Fearing that Buffy is in hell, Willow suggests at the beginning of the sixth season that she be raised from the dead. In a dark ceremony in which she expels a snake from her mouth, Willow performs the magic necessary to bring Buffy back. She is successful, but Buffy keeps it secret that she believes she was in heaven.\nWillow's powers grow stronger; she uses telepathy which her friends find intrusive, and she begins to cast spells to manipulate Tara. After Willow fails Tara's challenge to go for one week without performing magic, Tara leaves her, and for two episodes Willow descends into addiction that almost gets Dawn killed. Willow goes for months without any magic, helping Buffy track three geeks called The Trio who grandiosely aspire to be supervillains.\nImmediately following Willow's reconciliation with Tara, Warren (Adam Busch), one of the Trio, shoots Buffy; a stray shot kills Tara right in front of Willow. In an explosion of rage and grief, Willow soaks up all the dark magic she can, which turns her hair and eyes black. In the final episodes of the season Willow becomes exceedingly strong, surviving unharmed when Warren hits her in the back with an axe. \u201cAxe not gonna cut it,\u201d she quips. She hunts Warren, tortures him by slowly pushing a bullet into his body, then kills him by magically flaying him. Unsatisfied, she attempts to kill the other two members of the Trio but is unsuccessful due to her weakening power. She solves this problem by killing her 'dealer' from earlier in the season and draining him of his magic. When she is confronted by Buffy they begin to fight, only to be stopped by Giles who has borrowed magic from a coven of wiccans. Willow successfully drains him of this borrowed magic, fulfilling his plan and causing her to feel all the pain of everyone in the world. She tries to ease the pain by destroying the world, finally stopped by Xander\u2019s passionate confession of platonic familial love for her.\nSeason 7.\nThe seventh season starts with Willow in England, unnerved by her power, studying with a coven near Giles' home to harness it. She fears returning to Sunnydale and what she is capable of doing if she loses control again, a fear that dogs her the whole season.\nBuffy and the Scoobies face the First Evil, bent on ending the Slayer line and destroying the world. Potential Slayers from around the globe congregate at Buffy's home and she trains them to battle the First Evil. Willow continues to face her grief over Tara's death and, reluctantly, becomes involved with one of the Potentials, Kennedy (Iyari Limon).\nIn the final episode of the series, \"Chosen\", Buffy calls upon Willow to perform the most powerful spell she has ever attempted. With Kennedy nearby, cautioned to kill her if she becomes out of control, Willow infuses every Potential Slayer in the world with the same powers Buffy and Faith have. The spell momentarily turns her hair white and makes her glow\u2014Kennedy calls her \"a goddess\"\u2014and it ensures that Buffy and the Potentials defeat the First Evil. Willow is able to escape with Buffy, Xander, Giles, Faith and Kennedy as Sunnydale is destroyed.\nThrough the gamut of changes Willow endures in the series, \"Buffy\" studies scholar Ian Shuttleworth states that Alyson Hannigan's performances are the reason for Willow's popularity: \"Hannigan can play on audience heartstrings like a concert harpist... As an actress she is a perfect interpreter in particular of the bare emotional directness which is the specialty of [series writer Marti] Noxon on form.\"\nComic series (since 2007).\nSubsequent to \"Buffy\"'s television finale, Dark Horse Comics collaborated with Joss Whedon to produce a canonical comic book continuation of the series, \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight\" (2007\u201311), written by Whedon and many other writers from the television series. Unfettered by the practical limitations of casting or a television special effects budget, \"Season Eight\" explores more fantastic storylines, characters, and abilities for Willow. Willow's cover art is done by Jo Chen, and Georges Jeanty and Karl Moline produce character artwork and provide alternative covers. It was followed by two closely interlinked sequels, \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine\" and \"Angel &amp; Faith\" (both 2012\u201314). Willow features at different times in both series, as well as in her own spin-off miniseries. Jeanty continues to provide Willow's likeness in \"Season Nine\", while Rebekah Isaacs and Brian Ching are the primary pencillers of \"Angel &amp; Faith\" and \"Willow: Wonderland\" respectively. While \"Season Nine\" and \"Angel &amp; Faith\" are substantially less fantastical in tone than \"Season Eight\", Willow's spin-off is high fantasy and focuses on her journey through magical alternate worlds.\nWillow appears to Buffy and Xander, who are in charge of thousands of Slayers, a year after the destruction of Sunnydale. Willow reveals a host of new abilities including being able to fly and absorbing others' magic to deconstruct it. The Big Bad of \"Season Eight\" is a being named Twilight who is bent on destroying magic in the world. A one-shot comic dedicated to Willow's story was released in 2009 titled \"Willow: Goddesses and Monsters\". It explores the time she took away to discover more about her magical powers, under the tutelage of a half-woman half-snake demon named Aluwyn. Willow is still involved with Kennedy through \"Season Eight\", but becomes intimate with Aluwyn while they are together. She also continues to deal with grief from Tara's death, and struggles with the dark forces of magic that put her in opposition to Buffy. At the conclusion of the season, Buffy destroys an object, a seed, that is the source of the magic in the world, leaving Willow powerless. Whedon divulged that recovering her magical abilities will become Willow's \"personal obsession\" in a miniseries where she will be the central character.\nOther publications.\nWillow returns to Sunnydale in Kendare Blake\u2019s young adult novels, \"Buffy: The Next Generation Series\". This trilogy is a sequel series to the television show and focuses on Frankie Rosenberg, Willow\u2019s daughter. \nIdentities.\nFrom the inception of Willow's character in the first season, she is presented with contradictions. Bookish, rational, naive, and sometimes absent-minded, she is also shown being open to magic, aggressively boyish, and intensely focused. Willow is malleable, in continuous transition more so than any other \"Buffy\" character. She is, however, consistently labeled as dependable and reliable by the other characters and thus to the audience, making her appear to be stable. She is unsure of who she is; despite all the tasks she takes on and excels at, for much of the series she has no identity. This is specifically exhibited in the fourth season finale \"Restless\", an enigmatic pastiche of characters' dream sequences. In Willow's dream, she moves from an intimate moment painting a love poem by Sappho on Tara's bare back, to attending the first day of drama class to learn that she is to be in a play performed immediately for which she does not know the lines or understand. The dream presents poignant anxieties about how she appears to others, not belonging, and the consequences of people finding out her true self. As Willow gives a book report in front of her high school class, she discovers herself wearing the same mousy outfit she wore in the first episode of the show (\"Welcome to the Hellmouth\") as her friends and classmates shout derisively at her, and Oz and Tara whisper intimately to each other in the audience. She is attacked and strangled by the First Slayer as the class ignores her cries for help.\nLong a level-headed character who sacrifices her own desires for those of her friends, she gradually abandons these priorities to be more independent and please herself. She is often shown making choices that allow her to acquire power or knowledge and avoid emotional conflict. The story arc of Willow's growing dependence on magic was noted by Marti Noxon as the representation of \"adult crossroads\" and Willow's inability and unwillingness to be accountable for her own life. Willow enjoys power she is unable to control. She steals to accomplish her vocational goals and rationalizes her amoral behavior. This also manifests itself in a competitive streak and she accuses others who share their concerns that she uses magic for selfish purposes of being jealous. No longer the conscience of the Scooby Gang, Willow cedes this role to Tara then revels in breaking more rules. After Tara leaves Willow, Willow divulges to Buffy that she does not know who she is and doubts her worth and appeal\u2014specifically to Tara\u2014without magic. Contradicting the characterization of Willow's issues with magic as addiction, \"Buffy\" essayist Jacqueline Lichtenberg writes \"Willow is not addicted to magic. Willow is addicted to the surging hope that this deed or the next or the next will finally assuage her inner pain.\"\nVamp Willow.\nVamp Willow appears in the third season episodes \"The Wish\" and \"Doppelgangland\". She is and aggressive, the opposite of Willow's usual nature; her bad behavior so exaggerated that it does not instill fear into the viewer like other female vampires in the series, but indicates more about Willow's personality. Shocked upon seeing her alter ego in \"Doppelgangland\", Willow states \"That's me as a vampire? I'm so evil and . And I think I'm kinda gay!\" Angel is stopped by Buffy in telling the Scoobies that the vampire self carries many of the same attributes as the human self, at which Willow says that is nothing like her. Many Buffy fans saw this as a funny Easter egg when Willow revealed herself to actually be lesbian in later seasons. As surprised as Willow is with Vamp Willow, she feels bound to her, and does not have the heart to allow Buffy to kill her. Both Willows make the observation that \"this world's no fun\", before they send Vamp Willow back into the alternate dimension from which she came, whereupon she is staked and dies immediately.\nDark Willow.\nA shadow of Dark Willow appears to fight Glory in the fifth season episode \"Tough Love\", but she does not come into full force until the sixth season in \"Villains\", \"Two to Go\", and \"Grave\". The transition from Willow into Dark Willow, precipitated by Tara's immediate death when she is shot through the heart, was ambiguously received by audiences, many of whom never foresaw Willow's psychic break. It was simultaneously lauded for being an overwhelming depiction of a powerful woman, and derided as representative of a worn clich\u00e9 that lesbians are amoral and murderous. Dark Willow proved to be exceptionally more powerful than Buffy. She changes visually when she walks into the Magic Box, a store owned by Giles, telekinetically retrieves dozens of dark magic books from the shelves, and leeches the words from the pages with her fingertips. As the words crawl up her arms and soak into her skin, her eyes and hair become black and her posture \"aggressively aware and confident\".\nSusan Driver writes that it is \"crucial to recognize that never before in a teen series has raw fury been so vividly explored through a young queer girl responding to the sudden death of her lover\". Dark Willow is preternaturally focused on revenge, relentless and unstoppable. Lights explode when she walks past. She forcefully takes advantage of any opportunity to further her goals. She saves Buffy by removing the bullet from her chest, but later commandeers a tractor trailer, making it slam into Xander's car while he and Buffy are inside protecting Jonathan and Andrew, the other two members of the Trio. She floats, flies and dismantles the local jail where Jonathan and Andrew are held.\nShe is cruelly honest to Dawn and Buffy, and overpowers everyone with whom she comes in contact. When she takes Giles' magic from him, she gains the ability to feel the world's pain, becoming determined to put the world out of its misery. She does not acknowledge her grief, and only Xander can force her to face it when he tells her that he loves her no matter what or who she is, and if she is determined to end the world she must start by killing him. Only then does Willow return, sobbing.\nAt Salon.com, Stephanie Zacharek writes that Dark Willow is \"far from being a cut-out angry lesbian, is more fleshed out, and more terrifyingly alive, than she has ever been before. More than any other character, she has driven the momentum of the past few episodes; she very nearly drove it off a cliff.\" Several writers state that Willow's transition into Dark Willow is inevitable, grounded in Willow's self-hatred that had been festering from the first season. Both Dark Willow and even Willow herself state that Willow's sacrifices for her friends and lack of assertiveness are her undoing. In \"Doppelgangland\", Willow (posing as Vampire Willow) says \"It's pathetic. She lets everyone walk all over her and gets cranky at her friends for no reason.\" In \"Two to Go\", Dark Willow remarks \"Let me tell you something about Willow. She's a loser. And she always has been. People picked on Willow... and now Willow's a junkie.\" Vamp Willow served as an indicator of what Willow is capable of; immediately before she flays Warren in one violent magical flash, she uses the same line Vamp Willow used in the third season: \"Bored now.\"\nFollowing the sixth season, Willow struggles to allow herself to perform magic without the darkness within her taking her over. She is no longer able to abstain from magic as it is such an integral part of her that doing so will kill her. In the instances when she is highly emotional the darkness comes out. Willow must control that part of her and is occasionally unable to do so, giving her a trait similar to Angel, a cursed vampire who fears losing his soul will turn him evil. In a redemptive turn, when Willow turns all the Potentials into Slayers, she glows and her hair turns white, astonishing Kennedy and prompting her to call Willow a goddess.\nRelationships.\nWillow's earliest and most consistent relationships are with Buffy and Xander, both of whom she refers to as her best friends although they have their conflicts, and Giles as a father figure. Willow takes on the leadership role when Buffy is unavailable, and her growing powers sometimes make her resent being positioned as Buffy's sidekick. Some scholars see Willow as Buffy's sister-figure or the anti-Buffy, similar to Faith, another Slayer whose morals are less strict. In early seasons, Willow's unrequited crush on Xander creates some storylines involving the relationships between Xander, Cordelia, and Oz. Willow is part of a powerful quartet: she represents the spirit, Giles intelligence, Xander heart, and Buffy strength of the Scoobies. Although they often drift apart, they are forced to come together and work in these roles to defeat forces they are unable to fight individually.\nOz.\nWillow meets stoic Oz in the second season. Their courtship is slow and patient. Oz is bitten by a werewolf, and just as Willow begins to confront him about why he does not spend time with her, he transforms and attacks her. She must shoot him with a tranquilizer gun several times while he is wild, but her assertiveness in doing so makes her more confident in their relationship. Oz's trials in dealing with a power he cannot control is, according to authors J. Michael Richardson and J. Douglas Rabb, a model for Willow to reference when she encounters her own attraction to evil. When Willow and Oz decide to commit to each other, Willow is enthusiastic that she has a boyfriend, and, as a guitarist in a band, one so cool. Her relationship with Oz endures the high school storylines of exploring her attraction to Xander, which briefly separates them. She worries that she is not as close to Oz as she could be. They stay together through graduation into college, but Oz is drawn to Veruca, another werewolf. He admits an animal attraction to Veruca, which he does not share with Willow. He sleeps with Veruca and leaves shortly after to explore the werewolf part of himself. Willow becomes very depressed and doubts herself. She drinks, her magical abilities are compromised, her spells come out wrong, and she lashes out at her friends when they suggest she get over it (\"Something Blue\").\nJoss Whedon did not intend to write Oz out of the series. Seth Green came to Whedon early in the fourth season to announce that he wished to work on his film career. Whedon admitted he was upset by Green's announcement and that if he had wanted to continue, Oz would have been a part of the story. However, to resolve the relationship between Oz and Willow Whedon says, \"we had to scramble. And out of the heavens came Amber Benson.\"\nTara Maclay.\n\"Buffy\" earned international attention for its unflinching focus on the relationship between Willow and Tara Maclay. Whedon and the writing staff had been considering developing a story arc in which a character explores his or her sexuality as the Scoobies left high school, but no particular effort was made to assign this arc to Willow. In 1999, at the end of the third season, the \"Boston Herald\" called \"Buffy\" \"the most gay show on network TV this year\" despite having no overtly gay characters among the core cast. It simply presented storylines that resembled coming out stories. In the fourth season episode \"Hush\", Willow meets Tara, and to avoid being killed by a group of ghouls, they join hands to move a large vending machine telekinetically to barricade a door. The scene was, upon completion, noticeably sensual to Whedon, the producers, and network executives, who encouraged Whedon to develop a romantic storyline between Willow and Tara, but at the same time placed barriers on how far it could go and what could be shown. Two episodes later, Hannigan and Amber Benson were informed that their characters would become romantically involved. The actors were not told the end result of the Willow\u2013Oz\u2013Tara storyline, not sure what the eventual trajectory of the relationship would be, until Hannigan said, \"Then finally it was, 'Great! It's official. We're in luurrvvve.'\"\nWhedon made a conscious effort to focus on Willow and Tara's relationship instead of either's identity as a lesbian or the coming out process. When Willow discloses to Buffy what she feels for Tara, she indicates that she has fallen in love with Tara, not that she is a lesbian, and avoids categorizing herself. Some critics regard this as a failure on Willow's part to be strong; Em McAvan interprets this to mean that Willow may be bisexual. Scholar Farah Mendlesohn asserts that Willow's realization that she is in love with Tara allows viewers to re-interpret Willow's relationship with Buffy; in the first three seasons, Willow is often disappointed that she is not a higher priority to Buffy, and even after Willow enters a relationship with Tara, still desires to feel integral to Buffy's cause and the Scooby Gang.\nWillow's progression has been noted to be unique in television. Her relationship with Tara coincides with the development of her magical abilities becoming much more profound. By the seventh season, she is the most powerful person in Buffy's circle. Jessica Ford at PopMatters asserts that Willow's sexuality and her magical abilities are connected and represented by her relationships. In her unrequited attraction to Xander, she has no power. With Oz, she has some that gives her the confidence she sorely lacks, but his departure leaves her unsure of herself. Only when she meets Tara do her magical abilities flourish; to Ford, sexuality and magic are both empowering agents in Willow's story arc. David Bianculli in the \"New York Daily News\" writes that Willow's progression is \"unlike anything else I can recall on regular prime-time television: a character evolving naturally over four seasons of stories and arriving at a place of sexual rediscovery\".\nNot all viewers considered Willow and Tara's relationship a positive development. Some fans loyal to Willow reacted angrily as she chose to be with Tara when Oz made himself available, and they lashed out at Tara and Amber Benson on the fansite message boards. Whedon replied sardonically, \"we're going to shift away from this whole lifestyle choice that Willow has made. Just wipe the slate. From now on, Willow will no longer be a Jew. And I think we can all breathe easier.\" However, he seriously explained his motivation, writing \"My show is about emotion. Love is the most powerful, messy, delightful and dangerous emotion... Willow's in love. I think it's cool.\" Hannigan was also positive about the way the character and her relationship with Tara was written: \"It is not about being controversial or making a statement. I think the show is handling it really nicely. It's about two people who care about each other.\"\nContrasting with some of the more sexual relationships of the other characters, Willow and Tara demonstrate a sentimental, soft, and consistent affection for each other. Some of this was pragmatic: the show was restricted in what it could present to viewers. Willow and Tara did not kiss until the fifth season in an episode that diverted the focus away from the display of affection when Buffy's mother dies in \"The Body\". Before this, much of their sexuality is represented by allusions to witchcraft; spells doubled for physical affection such as an erotic ritual in \"Who Are You?\" where Willow and Tara chant and perspire in a circle of light until Willow falls back on a pillow gasping and moaning. Within the \"Buffy\" universe, magic is portrayed in a mostly female realm. As opposed to it being evil, it is an earth-bound force that is most proficiently harvested by women. The treatment of the lesbian relationship as integral to magic, representative of each other (love is magic, magic is love), earned the series some critical commentary from conservative Christians. To avoid large-scale criticism, scenes had to be shot several different ways because censors would not allow some types of action on screen. In the fourth and fifth seasons, the characters could be shown on a bed, but not under the covers. Hannigan noted the inconsistent standards with the other relationships on the show: \"you've got Spike and Harmony just going at it like rabbits, so it's very hypocritical\". As a couple, Willow and Tara are treated by the rest of the Scoobies with acceptance and little fanfare. Susan Driver writes that younger viewers especially appreciate that Willow and Tara are able to be affectionate without becoming overly sexual, thus making them objects of fantasy for male enjoyment. Willow and Tara's influence on specifically younger female viewers is, according to Driver, \"remarkable\".\nAcademics, however, comment that Willow is a less sexual character than the others in the show. She is displayed as \"cuddly\" in earlier seasons, often dressing in pink fuzzy sweaters resulting in an innocent tomboyishness. She becomes more feminine in her relationship with Tara, who is already feminine; no issues with gender are present in their union. Their relationship is sanitized and unthreatening to male viewers. When the series moved broadcast networks from The WB to UPN in 2001, some of the restrictions were relaxed. Willow and Tara are shown in some scenes to be \"intensely sexual\", such as in the sixth season episode \"Once More, with Feeling\" where it is visually implied that Willow performs cunnilingus on Tara. When Willow and Tara reconcile, they spend part of the episode in \"Seeing Red\" unclothed in bed, covered by red sheets.\nWillow is more demonstrative in the beginning of her relationship with Tara. Where in her relationship with Oz she described herself as belonging to him, Tara states that she belongs to Willow. Willow finds in Tara a place where she can be the focus of Tara's attention, not having to appease or sacrifice as she has in the past. Tara, however, eclipses Willow's role as the moral center of the Scoobies, and as Willow becomes more powerful and less ethical, Tara becomes a maternal figure for the group. Willow acts as a sort of middle child between Xander's immaturity and Buffy's weighty responsibilities. She becomes completely devoted to and enamored of Tara, and then manipulates her to avoid conflict when Tara does not conform to what she wants. Displeased with how Willow abuses her power, especially toward herself, Tara leaves Willow while continuing to counsel Dawn and Buffy. Long after Tara's death, Willow faces the choices she made: in the \"Season Eight\" issue \"Anywhere But Here\", Willow tells Buffy that she is responsible for Tara's death. Her ambition to bring back Buffy from the dead inevitably led to Tara getting shot and killed. In the one-shot comic, Willow is offered Tara as a guide for her mystical path to understanding her own powers, but rejects her as being an illusion, too much of a comfort, and not a guide who will force her to grow. She begins a relationship with Kennedy.\nKennedy.\nFollowing protests angry about the death of Tara, Whedon and the writing team made a decision to keep Willow gay. In 2002, he told \"The Advocate\" about the possibility of Willow having a relationship with a man, \"We do that now, and we will be burned alive. And possibly justifiably. We can't have Willow say, 'Oh, cured now, I can go back to cock!' Willow is not going to be straddling that particular fence. She will just be gay.\" Kennedy is markedly different from Tara. She is younger, outspoken, and aggressively pursues Willow, who hesitates to become involved again. When they first kiss in the episode \"The Killer in Me\", Willow's realization that she let Tara go reacts with a curse put upon her by another witch named Amy Madison (Elizabeth Anne Allen), turning Willow into Warren, Tara's murderer. The spell is broken when Willow acknowledges her guilt and Kennedy kisses her again. Kennedy expresses that she does not understand the value of magic and assumes it involves tricks, not the all-consuming energy that Willow is capable of. When Willow eventually exhibits what power she has, it briefly frightens Kennedy. Willow worries about becoming sexually intimate with Kennedy, unsure of what may transpire if she loses control of herself.\nIn season 7 episode 20, \"Touched\", in which practically all the main cast has sex (two by two) Willow and Kennedy take part in the first lesbian sex scene on primetime television.\nIn \"Season Eight\", Kennedy and Willow are still romantically involved, but separated during Willow's self-exploration. Unlike her relationship with Tara, Willow is able to hold a separate identity while with Kennedy. When she realizes her powers have gone at the end of \"Season Eight\", however, Willow ends her relationship with Kennedy, saying that there is someone else Willow is in love with, who she will never see again.\nKennedy's role split many Buffy fans into two groups. Many viewers hated Kennedy, because they saw her as a way of saying; \"Tara's dead, let's move on.\" and they weren't ready to. After the emotional death of Tara and Willow's reaction (nearly ending all life on Earth) many fans thought that it was ridiculous for Willow to recover and move on so quickly. Kennedy overall, has received much hate, but there is the other side who say that she was exactly what Willow needed to recover and continue a happy life.\nCultural impact.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWillow Rosenberg is undoubtedly the most complexly represented girl in love and lust with other girls to be developed within a mainstream network television series.\nSusan Driver in \"Queer Girls and Popular Culture\"\nWillow's religion and sexuality have made her a role model for audiences. Whedon, however, has compared her Jewish identity to her sexuality, stating that they are rarely made a significant focus of the show. Willow at times reminds the other characters of her religion, wondering what her father might think of the crucifixes she must apply to her bedroom wall to keep out vampires, and commenting that Santa Claus misses her house every Christmas because of the \"big honkin' menorah\". \"Buffy\" essayist Matthew Pateman criticizes the show for presenting Willow's Jewish identity only when it opposes Christian declarations of holidays and other traditions. \"The New York Times\", however, named her as a positive example of a depiction of a Jewish woman, who stood out among portrayals of Jews as harsh, unfeminine, and shallow. Producer Gail Berman states that as a Jew, Willow \"handles herself just fine, thank you\".\nIn \"Queer Girls and Popular Culture\", Susan Driver states that television ascribes to viewers what lesbians look and act like, and that realistic portrayals of girls outside the norm of white, upper or middle class, and heterosexual are extremely rare. Realistic depictions of lesbians are so rare that they become strong role models and enable \"hope and imagination\" for girls limited by the conditions of their immediate surroundings, who may know of no other gay people. The time and space given to Willow to go from being a shy scared girl into a confident woman who falls in love with another woman is, as of 2007, unique in television; it does not occur in one flash or single moment. It is a progression that defies strict definition. Manda Scott in \"The Herald\" states that Willow's lack of panic or self-doubt when she realizes she is in love with Tara makes her \"the best role model a teen could ask for\".\nWhen viewers realized that Willow was falling in love with Tara, Whedon remembered that some threatened to boycott the show, complaining \"You made Willow a fag\", to which he responded, \"Bye. We'll miss you \"a whole lot.\"\" However, he also said, \"For every (negative) post, there's somebody saying, 'You made my life a lot easier because I now have someone I can relate to on screen'.\" Gay characters had been portrayed before on television, and at the time the popular sitcom \"Will &amp; Grace\" was on the air. Lesbian-themed HBO special \"If These Walls Could Talk 2\" won an Emmy. Twenty-three television shows depicted a gay character of some kind in 2000. However, these other characters were mostly desexualized, none were partnered or shown consistently affectionate towards the same person. Willow and Tara's relationship became the first long-term lesbian relationship on U.S. television. \"Jane\" magazine hailed Willow and Tara as a bold representation of gay relationship, remarking that \"they hold hands, slow-dance and lay in bed at night. You won't find that kind of normalcy on \"Will and Grace\".\" Despite Whedon's intentions of not making \"Buffy\" about overcoming issues, he said Willow's exploration of her sexuality \"turned out to be one of the most important things we've done on the show\".\nAlthough the show's writers and producers received a minimal negative reaction from Willow choosing Tara over Oz, the response from viewers and critics alike was overwhelming towards Whedon for killing Tara, accusing him of homophobia. Particularly because Tara's death came at a point where Willow and Tara had reconciled and were shown following an apparent sexual encounter, the writers were criticized for representing the consequences of lesbian sex as punishable by death. Series writer and producer Marti Noxon\u2014whose mother fell in love with another woman when Noxon was 13 years old\u2014was unable to read some of the mail the writing team received because it was so upsetting. To her, the pain expressed in viewers' letters was a logical reaction to the lack of realistic lesbian role models on television. Willow's storyline in season 6 as Dark Willow, inspired by \"The Dark Phoenix Saga\", became quite popular within the genre. The character Josie Saltzman from the show \"Legacies\" has been accused of copying the Dark Willow. \"Screen Rant\" also wrote an article talking about how \"Riverdale\"'s Betty Cooper did the same storyline as Dark Willow for Dark Betty.\nWillow's cultural impact has been noted in several other ways. Patrick Krug, a biologist at California State University, Los Angeles named a sea slug with traits of sexual flexibility \"Alderia willowi\" partly for his grandmother and partly after Willow's character. Willow was included in AfterEllen.com's Top 50 Lesbian and Bisexual Characters, ranking at No. 7. She was also ranked No. 12 in their Top 50 Favorite Female TV Characters. UGO.com named her one of the best TV nerds. AOL also listed her as the #1 TV witch of all time, and one of the 100 Most Memorable Female TV Characters.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It contains all 15 mountains in Wales over 3000 feet high, including the country's highest, Snowdon (), which is tall. These peaks are all part of the Snowdon, Glyderau, and Carneddau ranges in the north of the region. The lower Moelwynion and Moel Hebog ranges lie immediately to the south.\nThe national park has an area of (the fourth-largest in the UK), and covers most of central and southern Gwynedd and the western part of Conwy County Borough. This is much larger than the area traditionally considered Snowdonia, and in addition to the five ranges above includes the Rhinogydd, Cadair Idris, and Aran ranges and the Dyfi Hills. It also includes most of the coast between Porthmadog and Aberdyfi. The park was the first of the three national parks of Wales to be designated, in October 1951, and the third in the UK after the Peak District and Lake District, which were established in April and May 1951 respectively. The park received 3.89 million visitors in 2015.\nToponymy.\nThe name \"Snowdon\" means \"snow hill\" and is derived from the Old English elements \"sn\u0101w\" and \"d\u016bn\", the latter meaning \"hill\". It is first recorded as \"Snawdune\" in 1095. \"Snowdonia\" is derived from the name of the mountain and is first recorded in 1284, but there is no evidence it survived in common use until it was re-popularised in the nineteenth century. The Welsh name of the mountain is \"\", and is unrelated to the name of the area.\n is first recorded in 1191. It likely derived from , meaning \"ridge\", with the collective form referring to the area around Snowdon. A popular interpretation is that the name means \"place of the eagle\", as also means \"eagle\" and the two meanings are probably cognate.\nExtent.\nBefore the boundaries of the national park were designated, \"Snowdonia\" was generally used to refer to a smaller upland area of northern centred on the Snowdon massif. The national park covers an area more than twice that size, extending south into the area.\nThis difference is apparent in books published before 1951. In George Borrow's 1862 \"Wild Wales\" he states that \"Snowdon or Eryri is no single hill, but a mountainous region, the loftiest part of which [is] called Y Wyddfa\", making a distinction between the summit of the mountain and the surrounding massif. \"The Mountains of Snowdonia\" by H. Carr &amp; G. Lister (1925) defines \"Eryri\" as \"composed of the two cantrefs of Arfon and Arllechwedd, and the two commotes of Nant Conwy and Eifionydd\", which corresponds to Caernarfonshire with the exception of southwest Ll\u0177n and the Creuddyn Peninsula. \nIn \"Geography\" \"Volume 26\", a journal of the Geographical Association published in 1941, Thomas Cotterill Warrington, writes a section titled \"Nomenclature in the Mountains of Carnarvonshire\" defining both \"Snowdonia\" and \"Eryri\". \"Snowdonia\" was described by Warrington as a \"tourist's or mountaineer's term\" which encompassed the district containing Pen-y-Gwryd at its centre. Its boundaries were described as stretching from the Conwy valley to Fairy Glen gorge (near Betws-y-Coed), then from the Lledr Valley towards Dolwyddelan, and then across the hills to the valley of Ffestiniog and to Porthmadog (Portmadoc), before following the road to Caernarfon passing Dolbenmaen and Llanllyfni. \"Eryri\" was defined by Warrington to encompass all of what he described as \"Snowdonia\" plus adding the highlands between Bwlch Mawr and Yr Eifl.\nIn the 1946 book \"National Parks for Britain\", by Henry Chessell, he stated that the term \"Snowdonia\" was a Latin term dating to Edward I of England and applied to the \"mountain district of Carnarvonshire\". Which encompasses the masses of Snowdon, the Carneddau, Glyderau, Moel Hebog, as well as the mountains extending from Moel Siabod forming the Moelwynion which was in neighbouring Merionethshire. The Nant Ffrancon Pass, Llanberis Pass, the glen between Siabod, the Glyderau and Capel Curig, and the Gwynant valley to Beddgelert, separates those mountain groups. Snowdonia was also suggested to extend further south into Merionethshire, with this part bounded by the north by Afon Glaslyn, the glen between Dolgellau and Trawsfynydd to the east, Cadair Idris (overlooking the Mawddach estuary) to the south and the coast to the west.\nIn \"Snowdonia: The National Park of North Wales\" (1949), F. J. North states that \"When the Committee delineated provisional boundaries, they included areas some distance beyond Snowdonia proper\".\nNational park.\nEryri National Park (), originally named Snowdonia National Park, was established in October 1951 under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. The 1947 Hobhouse Report, the precursor to the Act, recommended the creation of a \"North Wales National Park\" with boundaries similar to those ultimately adopted, but including the area around Lake Vyrnwy and excluding the entire coastal strip from Harlech to Barmouth. Eryri was the third national park to be established the United Kingdom, following the Peak District and Lake District in April and May 1951. \nThe park has an area , covering much of central and southern Gwynedd and the western part of Conwy County Borough, and has of coastline. The Hobhouse Report recommended against including the town of Blaenau Ffestiniog in the national park owing to the \"disfigurement\" caused by its slate quarries, and it forms an enclave near the centre of the area. The coastal towns of Tywyn and Barmouth are also excluded. \nThe park is governed by a national park authority, which was established in 1995 and has 18 members: 9 appointed by Gwynedd Council, 3 by Conwy County Borough Council, and 6 by the Welsh Government to represent the national interest. The authority's main offices are at Penrhyndeudraeth. Unlike national parks in other countries, national parks in the United Kingdom consist of both public and private land under a central planning authority. More than 26,000 people live within the park, of whom 58.6% could speak Welsh in 2011. While most of the land is either open or mountainous, there is a significant amount of agricultural activity within the park.\nThe national park authority used the name \"Snowdonia\" in English-language contexts until, in November 2022, it announced that it would begin a transition to using only \"Eryri\" in order to prioritise the Welsh language name for the area; it also began using in preference to \"Snowdon\" to refer to the mountain. Following a two-year transition period, the authority announced in November 2024 that the changes would be kept due to its success in gaining support and its adoption by many businesses and by the media. The authority also announced that the national park logo would be changed to remove \"Snowdonia\".\nGeology.\nThe geology of Snowdonia is key to the area's character. Glaciation during a succession of ice ages has carved a distinctive rocky landscape from a heavily faulted and folded succession of sedimentary and igneous rocks. The last ice age ended only just over 11,500 years ago, leaving features attractive to visitors, which have also played a part in the development of geological science and continue to provide a focus for educational visits. Visiting Cwm Idwal in 1841, Charles Darwin realised that the landscape was the product of glaciation. The bedrock dates largely from the Cambrian and Ordovician periods with intrusions of Ordovician and Silurian age associated with the Caledonian Orogeny. There are smaller areas of Silurian age sedimentary rocks in the south and northeast and of Cenozoic era strata on the Cardigan Bay coast, though the latter are concealed by more recent deposits. Low grade metamorphism of Cambrian and Ordovician mudstones has resulted in the slates, the extraction of which once formed the mainstay of the area's economy.\nGeography.\nMountains.\nThe principal ranges of the traditional Snowdonia are the Snowdon massif itself, the Glyderau, the Carneddau, the Moelwynion and the Moel Hebog range. All of Wales' 3000ft mountains are to be found within the first three of these massifs and are most popular with visitors. To their south within the wider national park are the Rhinogydd and the Cadair Idris and Aran Fawddwy ranges. Besides these well-defined areas are a number of mountains which are less readily grouped, though various guidebook writers have assigned them into groups such as the \"Arenigs\", the \"Tarrens\" and the \"Dyfi hills\".\nSnowdon's summit at is the highest in Wales and the highest in Britain south of the Scottish Highlands. At , is the highest in Wales outside of northern Snowdonia; , at , is next in line.\nRivers and lakes.\nRivers draining the area directly into Cardigan Bay are typically short and steep. From north to south they include:\nA series of rivers drain to the north coast. Largest of these is the Conwy on the park's eastern margin, which along with the drains into Conwy Bay. Further west the and empty into the western end of the Menai Strait. Part of the east of the national park is within the upper Dee (Dyfrydwy) catchment and includes Bala Lake, the largest natural water body in Wales.\nA fuller list of the rivers and tributaries within the area is found at List of rivers of Wales.There are few natural bodies of water of any size in Wales; Snowdonia is home to most. Besides Bala Lake, a few lakes occupy glacial troughs, including and at and south of . , and to the south and west of Snowdon feature in this category, as do and on the margins of the . There are numerous small lakes occupying glacial cirques, owing to the intensity of past glacial action in Snowdonia. Known generically as tarns, examples are and on Snowdon, within the and on .\nThere are two large wholly man-made bodies of water in the area, and , whilst a number of the natural lakes have had their levels artificially raised. reservoir and Power Station's are two cases where natural tarns have been dammed as part of pumped storage hydro-electric schemes.\nA fuller list of the lakes within the area is found at List of lakes of Wales. In 2023, the park standardised its Welsh language lake names, to be also used in English.\nCoast.\nThe national park meets the Irish Sea coast within Cardigan Bay between the Dovey estuary in the south and the estuary. The larger part of that frontage is characterised by dune systems, the largest of which are and . These two locations have two of the largest sand/shingle spits in Wales. The and estuaries form the largest indentations, and have large expanses of intertidal sands and coastal marsh which are especially important for wildlife: see #Natural history. The northern tip of the national park extends to the north coast of Wales at Point, west of , where precipitous cliffs have led to the road and railway tunnels.\nSettlements.\nThere are only three towns within the park boundary, though there are several more immediately beyond it. is the most populous followed by Bala on the eastern boundary and then Harlech overlooking Tremadog Bay. More populous than these is the town of Blaenau Ffestiniog, which is within an exclave, that is to say it is surrounded by the national park but excluded from it, whilst the towns of Tywyn and Barmouth on the Cardigan Bay coast are within coastal exclaves. in the east, Machynlleth in the south and Porthmadog and Penrhyndeudraeth in the west are immediately beyond the boundary but still identified with the park; indeed the last of these hosts the headquarters of the Snowdonia National Park Authority. Similarly the local economies of the towns of Conwy, Bethesda, and Llanberis in the north are inseparably linked to the national park as they provide multiple visitor services. The lower terminus of the Snowdon Mountain Railway is at Llanberis. Though adjacent to it, and are less obviously linked to the park.\nThere are numerous smaller settlements within the national park: prominent amongst these are the eastern 'gateway' village of , Aberdyfi on the Dovey () estuary and the small village of each of which attract large numbers of visitors. Other sizeable villages are at the southwest end of Bala Lake (), Dyffryn Ardudwy, Corris, Trawsfynydd, Llanbedr, Trefriw and Dolwyddelan.\nTransport.\nRoads.\nSix primary routes serve Snowdonia, the busiest of which is the A55, a dual carriageway which runs along the north coast and provides strategic road access to the northern part of the national park. The most important north\u2013south route within the park is the A470 running from the A55 south past to to . It exits the park a few miles to the southeast near . From , the A494 runs to whilst the A487 connects with . The A487 loops around the northwest of the park from via to before turning in land to meet the A470 east of . The A5 was built as a mail coach road by Thomas Telford between London and Holyhead; it enters the park near and leaves it near Bethesda. Other A class roads provide more local links; the A493 down the Dovey valley from and up the coast to then back up the valley to , the A496 from down the north side of the to Barmouth then north up the coast via to . The A4212 connecting with is relatively modern having been laid out in the 1960s in connection with the construction of . Three further roads thread their often twisting and narrow way through the northern mountains; A4085 links with , the A4086 links with via and the A498 links with the A4086 at . Other roads of note include that from up to via the high pass of , the second highest tarmacked public road in Wales and the minor road running northwest and west from towards via the high pass of .\nBefore 1961 the route continued as the Bala and Ffestiniog Railway via Trawsfynydd to Bala, joining another former route along the Dee valley which ran southwest via Dolgellau to join the still extant coastal Cambrian Line south of Barmouth.\nRailways.\nMany sections of dismantled railway are now used by walking and cycling routes and are described elsewhere. The Bala Lake Railway is a heritage railway which has been established along a section of the former mainline route between Bala and Llanuwchllyn. Other heritage railways occupy sections of former mineral lines, often narrow gauge and are described in a separate section.\nBuses.\nThe national park is served by a growing bus network, branded \"Sherpa'r Wyddfa\" (formerly Snowdon Sherpa). The network was relaunched in July 2022 with this new brand to reflect the National Park's promotion of Welsh place names. Thus the publicity and websites for the newly branded service only use these Welsh names, even though the publicity is also directed at monoglot English speakers.\nTogether with the network of buses, this provides a car-free option for tourists and locals wishing to travel across the National Park.\nClimate.\nSnowdonia is one of the wettest parts of the United Kingdom; Crib Goch in Snowdonia is the wettest spot in the United Kingdom, with an average rainfall of a year over the 30-year period prior to the mid-2000s. (There is a rainfall gauge at on the slopes below Crib Goch.)\nHistory.\nThe earliest evidence for human occupation of the area dates from around 4000\u20133000 BC with extensive traces of prehistoric field systems evident in the landscape. Within these are traces of irregular enclosures and hut circles. There are burial chambers of Neolithic and Bronze Age such as Bryn Cader Faner and Iron Age hillforts such as Bryn y Castell near Ffestiniog.\nThe region was finally conquered by the Romans by AD 77\u201378. Remains of Roman marching camps and practice camps are evident. There was a Roman fort and amphitheatre at Tomen y Mur. Roads are known to have connected with (Caernarfon) and (Chester) and include the northern reaches of Sarn Helen.\nThere are numerous memorial stones of Early Christian affinity dating from the post-Roman period. The post-Roman hillfort of Dinas Emrys also dates to this time. Churches were introduced to the region in the 5th and 6th centuries. Llywelyn the Great and Llywelyn ap Gruffudd had various stone castles constructed to protect their borders and trade routes. Edward I built several castles around the margins including those at Harlech and Conwy for military and administrative reasons. Most are now protected within a World Heritage Site. Some of Snowdonia's many stone walls date back to this period too. In the Middle Ages, the title \"Prince of Wales and Lord of Snowdonia\" () was used by ; his grandfather used the title \"Prince of north Wales and Lord of Snowdonia\".\nThe 18th century saw the start of industrial exploitation of the area's resources, assisted by the appearance in the late part of the century of turnpike trusts making it more accessible. The engineer Thomas Telford left a legacy of road and railway construction in and around Snowdonia. A new harbour at Porthmadog linked to slate quarries at Ffestiniog via a narrow gauge railway. At its peak in the 19th century the slate industry employed around 12,000 men. A further 1000 were employed in stone quarrying at Graiglwyd and Penmaenmawr. Mining for copper, iron and gold was undertaken during the 18th and 19th centuries, leaving a legacy of mine and mill ruins today. Ruins of the gold industry are found at Cefn Coch on the Dolmelynllyn estate.\nThe Snowdonia Society is a registered charity formed in 1967; it is a voluntary group of people with an interest in the area and its protection.\nIn 1972, one of the two names Caernarvon Borough Council suggested, for the unnamed third district of Gwynedd, was \"Eryri\". Its other proposed name would later be chosen as the district of Arfon.\nAmory Lovins led the successful 1970s opposition to stop Rio Tinto digging up the area for a massive mine.\nNatural history.\nThe park's entire coastline is a Special Area of Conservation, which runs from the Ll\u0177n Peninsula down the mid-Wales coast, the latter containing valuable sand dune systems.\nThe park's natural forests are of the mixed deciduous type, the commonest tree being the Welsh oak. Birch, ash, mountain-ash and hazel are also common. The park also contains some large (planted) coniferous forested areas such as Gwydir Forest near Betws-y-Coed, although some areas, once harvested, are now increasingly being allowed to regrow naturally.\nFlora.\nNorthern Snowdonia is the only place in Britain where the Snowdon lily (\"Gagea serotina\"), an arctic\u2013alpine plant, is found and the only place in the world where the Snowdonia hawkweed \"Hieracium snowdoniense\" grows.\nOne of the major problems facing the park in recent years has been the growth of \"Rhododendron ponticum\". This fast-growing invasive species has a tendency to take over and stifle native species. It can form massive towering growths and has a companion fungus that grows on its roots producing toxins that are poisonous to any local flora and fauna for a seven-year period after the \"Rhododendron\" infestations have been eradicated. As a result, there are a number of desolate landscapes.\nFauna.\nMammals in the park include otters, polecats, feral goats, and pine martens. Birds include raven, red-billed chough, peregrine, osprey, merlin and the red kite. The rainbow-coloured Snowdon beetle (\"Chrysolina cerealis\") is only found in northern Snowdonia.\nThe feral goats found in Snowdonia are adapted to the rough and steep terrain. Thought to be descended from domesticated herds of goats, which were brought to the area by Neolithic farmers approximately 5,000 years ago. The goats are said to have become feral after being left and abandoned by farmers and now live in small herds. One herd that reside above Llanberis consists of more than 50 goats as of 2003, despite a cull in 2006 to control their population.\nConservation designations.\nSnowdonia has a particularly high number of protected sites in respect of its diverse ecology; nearly 20% of its total area is protected by UK and European law. Half of that area was set aside by the government under the European Habitats Directive as a Special Area of Conservation. There are a large number of Sites of special scientific interest (or 'SSSIs'), designated both for fauna and flora but also in some cases for geology. Nineteen of these sites are managed as national nature reserves by Natural Resources Wales. The park also contains twelve Special Areas of Conservation (or 'SACs'), three Special Protection Areas (or 'SPAs') and three Ramsar sites. Some are wholly within the park boundaries, others straddle it to various degrees.\nSites of Special Scientific Interest.\nThere are numerous SSSIs within the park, the most extensive of which are Snowdonia, Estuary, and .\nNational nature reserves.\nThe following NNRs are either wholly or partly within the park:\n (in multiple parts), (in 2 parts), and Snowdon.\nSpecial Areas of Conservation.\nThe twelve SACs are as follows:\nSpecial Protection Areas.\nThe three SPAs are Dovey Estuary / (of which a part is within the park), (of which a part is within the park) and .\nRamsar sites.\nThe three designated Ramsar sites are the Dyfi Biosphere (Cors Fochno and Dyfi), Cwm Idwal and Llyn Tegid (Bala Lake).\nEconomy.\nThe area's economy was traditionally centred upon farming and from the early 19th century increasingly on mining and quarrying. Tourism has become an increasingly significant part of Snowdonia's economy during the 20th and 21st centuries.\nHill farming.\nThe extensive farming of sheep remains central to Snowdonia's farming economy.\nForestry.\nSignificant sections of the park were afforested during the 20th century for timber production. Major conifer plantations include Dyfi Forest, Coed y Brenin Forest between Dolgellau and Trawsfynydd, Penllyn Forest south of Bala, Beddgelert Forest and Gwydyr (or Gwydir) Forest near Betws-y-Coed which is managed as a forest park by Natural Resources Wales.\nSlate industry.\nThe region was once the most important producer of slate in the world. Some production continues but at a much reduced level from its peak. The park boundaries are drawn such that much of the landscape affected by slate quarrying and mining lies immediately outside of the designated area.\nEnergy production.\nConstruction of a nuclear power station beside Llyn Trawsfynydd began in 1959 with the first power produced in 1965. The site was operational until 1991 though it continues as an employer during its decommissioning phase. Pumped storage hydroelectric schemes are in operation at Llanberis and Ffestiniog.\nTourism.\nResearch indicates that there were 3.67 million visitors to Snowdonia National Park in 2013, with approximately 9.74 million tourist days spent in the park during that year. Total tourist expenditure was \u00a3433.6 million in 2013.\nHiking.\nMany of the hikers in the area concentrate on Snowdon itself. It is regarded as a fine mountain, but at times gets very crowded; in addition the Snowdon Mountain Railway runs to the summit.\nThe other high mountains with their boulder-strewn summits as well as , one of the few mountains in the UK south of Scotland whose ascent needs hands as well as feet are also very popular. However, there are also some spectacular walks in Snowdonia on the lower mountains, and they tend to be relatively unfrequented. Among hikers' favourites are Y Garn (east of Llanberis) along the ridge to Elidir Fawr; Mynydd Tal-y-Mignedd (west of Snowdon) along the Nantlle Ridge to Mynydd Drws-y-Coed; Moelwyn Mawr (west of Blaenau Ffestiniog); and Pen Llithrig y Wrach north of Capel Curig. Further south are Y Llethr in the Rhinogydd, and Cadair Idris near Dolgellau.\nThe park has of public footpaths, of public bridleways, and of other public rights of way. A large part of the park is also covered by right to roam laws.\nRecreational routes.\nThe Wales Coast Path runs within the park between Machynlleth and Penrhyndeudraeth, save for short sections of coast in the vicinity of Tywyn and Barmouth which are excluded from the park. It touches the park boundary again at Penmaen-bach Point on the north coast. An inland alternative exists between Llanfairfechan and Conwy, wholly within the park. The North Wales Path, which predates the WCP, enters the park north of Bethesda and follows a route broadly parallel to the north coast visiting Aber Falls and the Sychnant Pass before exiting the park on the descent from Conwy Mountain. The Cambrian Way is a long-distance trail between Cardiff and Conwy that stays almost entirely within the national park from Mallwyd northwards. It was officially recognised in 2019, and is now depicted on Ordnance Survey maps.\nUse of in English.\nThere have been calls to use the Welsh name for the area, \"Eryri\", in preference to \"Snowdonia\" in English-language contexts. In 2003, the pressure group Cymuned campaigned for such a change, inspired by other campaigns such as Ayers Rock being known as Uluru and Mount Everest as Qomolangma. In 2020, an e-petition calling for the removal of the English name was put forward to the Senedd, but rejected as responsibility lies with the Snowdonia National Park Authority.\nIn 2021, an e-petition on the same topic attracted more than 5,300 signatures and was presented to the national park authority. The authority was already considering its language policy, but stated that the petition encouraged it to take \"decisive action\", and it resolved to use Welsh names as far as legally possible in November 2022; it must continue to use \"Snowdonia\" in statutory documents. Before the decision, the authority had already prioritised the Welsh names by using them first and giving the English names in parentheses. The naming policy applies only to the national park authority.\nIn November 2024, the authority stated that the name change had been a \"success\" as many businesses and media had followed suit. The authority stated that a summer survey showed \"strong support\" from locals and visitors for the name change. While some concerns were raised over misconceptions by some that the Welsh names were new and mispronunciations, the authority stated that the change resulted in the park being more associated with a Welsh identity, and more different from other UK national parks. The authority is set to make a pronunciation guide and update its logo which still contains Snowdonia. Two days later the authority revealed the new logo that removed the name \"Snowdonia\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is the founder of video game developer Llamasoft and has created dozens of games during his career, which began in 1981 with games for the ZX80. Minter's games are shoot 'em ups which contain titular or in-game references demonstrating his fondness of ruminants (llamas, sheep, camels, etc.). Many of his programs also feature something of a psychedelic element, as in some of the earliest \"light synthesizer\" programs including \"Trip-a-Tron\".\nMinter's works include the music visualisation program \"Neon\" (2004) which is built into the Xbox 360 console, and the video games \"Gridrunner\", \"Attack of the Mutant Camels\", \"Tempest 2000\", and \"Polybius\".\nGame development career.\nPre-commercial career (early years).\nMinter began programming computers at a young age. He wrote the game \"Deflex\" for the Commodore PET in 1979. However it would not be until a long illness during a university year that Minter's talents would develop in any meaningful way. Following a three-month stint due to a sudden eruption of pericarditis, in which Minter was restricted to lying on his back and was confined to his bed between November 1981 and January 1982, boredom led him to take up computer programming in earnest to pass the time.\nUpon recovery, Minter teamed up with Richard Jones, a fellow pupil, and together they started writing their own games on their school's Commodore PET. They soon parted ways. Jones went on to commercial projects, some of them in the software market (e.g., \"Interceptor Micros\").\nCommercial 8-bit games.\nIn 1981 Minter started independently writing and selling video games for the ZX80, the first machine he owned. Some were made for software company dk'tronics. These titles were sold as a package but this was not available for very long, as Minter left the company following a royalties dispute. He formed a partnership with his mother, Hazel Minter. Together they developed and commercially produced 20 games for the ZX81, VIC-20, Atari 8-bit computers, ZX Spectrum, and Commodore 64. Having been studying physics at the University of East Anglia, success in the programming industry prompted him to drop his studies and take up video game development full-time.\nThe following year, he founded the software house Llamasoft. His first Llamasoft game was a \"Defender\" clone for the VIC-20 called \"Andes Attack\" (US version: \"Aggressor\"). In \"Andes Attack\", the player had to protect llamas instead of the humanoids from \"Defender\". As a fan of \"Defender\", Minter would remake it again as \"Defender 2000\". Through the Brighton-based software house, Salamander Software, Minter had his games written for the Spectrum and other home microcomputers. It was Mr S.A. Tenquist who was responsible for the ZX Spectrum 16K version of \"Gridrunner\". The conversion was released and published for Christmas 1983 by Quicksilva Ltd., UK. Jeff Minter's original Commodore version was written in a week and marked his first commercial success both in the UK and in the US.\nMinter went on to develop a number of games for the Commodore 64, Atari 8-bit computers, and Atari ST which were marketed by word of mouth and magazine advertisements. These included \"Gridrunner\", \"Abductor\", \"Matrix: Gridrunner 2\", \"Hellgate\", \"Hover Bovver\", \"Attack of the Mutant Camels\", \"Revenge of the Mutant Camels\", \"Return of the Mutant Camels\", \"Laser Zone\", \"Mama Llama\", \"Metagalactic Llamas Battle at the Edge of Time\", \"Sheep in Space\", \"Voidrunner\", and \"Iridis Alpha\".\nPost 8-bit work.\nIn 1989, Minter helped in the production of the Konix Multisystem console.\nMinter worked for Atari and VM Labs. For Atari he produced \"Tempest 2000\" (1994) on the Jaguar. It was a remake of Dave Theurer's 1981 \"Tempest\". He followed it with \"Defender 2000\" (1995) on the Jaguar, a remake of the 1981 arcade game. Listing Minter in their \"75 Most Important People in the Games Industry of 1995\", \"Next Generation\" called him the Jaguar's \"leading developer\". Minter also produced the \"Virtual Light Machine\" (\"VLM-1\") for the Jaguar CD add-on. For VM Labs he created the \"VLM-2\" and \"Tempest 3000\".\nMinter then wrote games for the Pocket PC platform, some of which also have Windows conversions: \"Deflex\", \"Hover Bovver 2: Grand Theft Flymo\" (a reinterpretation of his own 1984 game, \"Hover Bovver\"), and \"Gridrunner++\".\nIn 2002, he began work on a music video game for the GameCube to be called \"Unity\". Using the newest version of his \"VLM\", the \"VLM-3\" or \"Neon\", \"Unity\" was to combine the two main threads of Minter's prior career: light synthesis and classic arcade style shooting. Minter was involved in writing this game for Lionhead Studios throughout 2003. The project was cancelled in December 2004. \"Neon\" has since been reprogrammed and significantly expanded and is used in Xbox 360 media visualisation.\nIn 2007 Minter released \"Space Giraffe\", an action video game with similarities to \"Tempest\". \"Space Giraffe\" was released for Xbox 360 through Xbox Live Arcade.\nIn 2008 it was announced at the Tokyo Game Show that designers at Llamasoft were working on the visualisation aspects of the Xbox 360 version of \"Space Invaders Extreme\". The game was released in 2008. In December 2008 \"Space Giraffe\" was released for Windows.\nIn September 2009 he released \"Gridrunner Revolution\" for Windows as a digital download.\nThe Minotaur Project.\nIn 2010, frustrated with the delays surrounding the release of his titles, Minter was keen to return to a style of game development where games could be produced and released quickly. The iOS platform was chosen and Llamasoft announced that a series of games would be produced under the banner \"The Minotaur Project\". The idea behind the series is that Llamasoft would develop a game in the style of a past computer or console but without the constraints of the original hardware.\nOn 5 January 2011 he released \"Minotaur Rescue\" for iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, iPod Touch (3rd generation), iPod Touch (4th generation), and iPad.\nOn 2 March 2011 Llamasoft released their second iOS game, '. \"Minotron: 2112\" is a remake of the Atari ST / Amiga game \"Llamatron\" (which was inspired by the coin-op video game '). An iOS version of \"Deflex\" was also released although this was not specifically labeled as being part of the Minotaur Project.\nOn 17 September 2011, Llamasoft released \"GoatUp\", their first platform game.\nOn 27 January 2012 \"Caverns of Minos\" was released followed on 24 March by Gridrunner iOS.\n\"Super Ox Wars\", a shoot-em-up based on \"Ikaruga\", was released in July 2012; the final game in the series, \"GoatUp 2\" was released in March 2013, unique in that it is the only Llamasoft title to feature a level editor.\nMinter then announced his intention to abandon mobile development due to lack of discoverability, low turnover, and the dominance of free-to-play and video game clones; he ultimately declared that, after accounting for his time, the Minotaur Project made a net loss. Minter stated on Twitter than \"Returning to iOS would be like returning to the scene of a mugging\" and \"I would advise any dev valuing integrity and sanity to just get the hell out\". As a result, the Minotaur Project games were not updated for 64-bit versions of iOS and were removed from the App Store while existing copies became unplayable on updated devices.\nThe code framework for the Minotaur Project games enables them to be rebuilt for both Mac and PC versions. Gridrunner was released for the Mac in August 2012.\nReturn to console games.\nIn April 2013 it was announced that Llamasoft had signed a deal with Sony Computer Entertainment to create a tube shooter for the PlayStation Vita called \"TxK\". The game would be Llamasoft's fourth tube shooter in two decades and was described as the spiritual successor of 1994's \"Tempest 2000\" for the Atari Jaguar. As Minter explained in his development blog the project goals were to create a more traditional, straightforward and accessible tube shooter than \"Space Giraffe\", to improve on the flaws from \"Tempest 2000\" and \"Tempest 3000\", and to evoke the neo-retro aesthetic without being cheesy. \"TxK\" was released on 11 February 2014, by digital download through PSN.\nAt the beginning of 2015, Minter was threatened with legal action by Atari, claiming that \"TxK\" was too similar to \"Tempest 2000\" - a game that Minter himself wrote, but Atari owned the rights to. This raised several issues, including Atari claiming that Minter that had illegally copied material from his own source code and violated design copyrights on his own design traditions. Sony was unwilling to support Minter and as such future versions of \"TxK\" were blocked from release, although the PS Vita version remains available.\nMinter and Zorzin's first publicly available game for a modern home console, \"Polybius\", was released on the PlayStation 4 on 9 May 2017. The game features extensive support for the PlayStation VR headset, based on Minter's experience building the unreleased VR version of \"TxK\". Shortly after release, Llamasoft were contacted by Trent Reznor of the band Nine Inch Nails, asking to use visuals from \"Polybius\" as the basis for the music video for the song \"Less Than\"; the video was released on 13 July the same year.\nIn August 2017, Atari, SA issued a press release, announcing a partnership with Llamasoft to develop \"Tempest 4000\" on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One video game consoles and Windows-based personal computers. It was released in July 2018.\nIn March 2018, Minter announced that the framework for the Minotaur Project had also been ported to the PlayStation 4 and stated an intention to release enhanced versions of the Minotaur Project games as console games in bundles under the name \"Minotaur Arcade\". In December 2018, Llamasoft released \"Minotaur Arcade Volume 1\" on Steam. This contained much enhanced versions of \"GoatUp\" and \"Gridrunner\" with support for playing on the Oculus Rift but also playable in 2D. A PlayStation 4 version of \"Minotaur Arcade Volume 1\" was released in October 2019.\nMinter revisited the enhanced Minotaur Arcade framework to produce an original game, \"Moose Life\", released on Steam in August 2020 and on PlayStation 4 in February 2021.\nIn December 2022, Minter announced that he had been contracted to produce a complete and up-to-date version of Atari's abandoned 1982 prototype arcade machine \"Akka Arrh\", the original version of which had become available to the wider public as part of the recently published collection '. In 2023, Digital Eclipse announced that they would be compiling 42 of Minter's games and releasing them as ', the second entry in their \"Gold Master Series\".\nOther appearances.\nMinter appeared in the interactive film \"\", released in December 2018. The film is based around the 1980s video game industry in the United Kingdom; Minter played Jerome F. Davies, the author of the titular \"Bandersnatch\" novel, who murdered his wife.\nMinter also contributed to the documentary film \"From Bedrooms to Billions\".\nMinter appears extremely briefly as a background character in \"Ashens and the Polybius Heist\".\nPersonal life.\nIn online forums and informal game credits pages Minter usually signs as \"Yak\", which is, in his own words\na pseudonym chosen a long time ago, back in the days when high score tables on coin-op machines only held three letters, and I settled on Yak because the yak is a scruffy hairy beast \u2013 a lot like me ;-).\nSince 2015, Minter has used the name \"Yak\" relatively rarely, usually signing as \"Stinky Ox\" or \"Jeff Minotaur\".\nHe lives in Wales with his partner Ivan \"Giles\" Zorzin, four sheep, two goats, two llamas and a dog. Although Minter is synonymous with Llamasoft, Zorzin is jointly responsible for the recent titles.\nMinter likes Indian food, particularly chicken vindaloo. Sheep are his favourite animal; he has kept them as pets for many years.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The association of knots with the symbolism of love, friendship and affection dates back to antiquity (although the term itself is attested from the late 1300s). Because of this, no single knot can be labeled the true \"true love knot\".\nIn practical terms, these knots are generally shown as two interlocked overhand knots made in two parallel ropes or cords. The variations are in the ways in which the overhand knots interweave and in the final arrangement of the knot or knots.\nThe true lovers' knot is a motif in several British folk songs, including \"Barbara Allen\", \"Lord Thomas and Fair Annet\", \"Lord Lovel\", and \"Fair Margaret and Sweet William\". The knot, made of a rose growing from one lover's grave and a brier from the other's, is described at the end of the ballad. It symbolises their fidelity in love even after death.\nModern Western knotting literature has the name for these related knots deriving from stories or legends in which the knots symbolize the connection between a couple in love. Many examples feature sailors separated from their beloveds. Ashley notes that it was once a common style in sailors' wedding rings, where gold wire was wrought to incorporate the \"true lovers\" knot, creating a ring containing two tori, inseparable, yet flexible and able to move about each other.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Although traditionally white, blancmanges are frequently given other colours.\nBlancmange originated at some time during the Middle Ages from the older Middle Eastern , and usually consisted of capon or chicken, milk or almond milk, rice, and sugar; it was considered to be an ideal food for the sick.\nSimilar desserts include Bavarian cream, Italian , Turkish , Brazilian , Chinese almond tofu, Hawai'ian and Puerto Rican .\nHistory.\nThe origins of the blancmange have long been believed to lie in the introduction of rice and almonds in early medieval Europe by Arab traders. Recently, it has been shown that there have been similar Arab dishes from that period such as muhallebi. Muhallebi, or another similar dish from the medieval Islamic world, spread to Europe first as \"blanc-manger\" in France, later translated to in Italy and in Spain. Additionally, related or similar dishes have existed in other areas of Europe under other names, such as the 13th-century Danish (\"white mush\"), and the Anglo-Norman (\"white dish\"); Dutch (from Latin , \"to strain\") was known in English as and in French as , and was based on cooked and then strained poultry. The oldest recipe for blancmange is from the oldest extant Danish cookbook, written by , who died in 1244, which dates it to the early 13th century at the latest. The work may be a translation of a German cookbook, which is believed to have been based on a Latin or Romance vernacular manuscript from the 12th century or even earlier.\nThe \"whitedish\" (from the original Old French term ) was a dish consumed by the upper-classes and common to most of Europe during the Middle Ages and early modern period. It occurs in countless variations from recipe collections from all over Europe and was one of the few truly international dishes of medieval and early modern Europe. It is mentioned in the prologue to Geoffrey Chaucer's \"Canterbury Tales\" and in an early 15th-century cookbook written by the chefs of Richard II. The basic ingredients were milk or almond milk, sugar, and shredded chicken (usually capon) or fish, often combined with rosewater and rice flour, and mixed into a bland stew. Almond milk and fish were used as substitutes for the other animal products on fast days and Lent. It was also often flavoured with spices such as saffron or cinnamon and the chicken could be exchanged for other fowl, such as quail or partridge. Spices were often used in recipes of the later Middle Ages since they were considered prestigious.\nOn festive occasions and among the upper classes, whitedishes were often rendered more festive by colouring agents: the reddish-golden yellow of saffron; green with various herbs; or sandalwood for russet. In 14th-century France, parti-colouring (the use of two bright contrasting colours on the same plate) was especially popular and was described by (also known as ), one of the primary authors of the later editions of . The brightly coloured whitedishes were one of the most common of the early entremets: edibles that were intended to entertain and delight through a gaudy appearance as much as through flavour.\nIn the 17th century (1666), the durian fruit was compared to blanc-mang\u00e9 by Alexandre de Rhodes: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"il est plein d'une liqueur blanche, \u00e9paisse &amp; sucr\u00e9e : elle est entierement semblable au blanc-mang\u00e9 , qu'on sert aux meilleures tables de France; c'est une chose fort saine, &amp; des plus delicates qu'on puisse manger\" [It is full of a white liquor, thick and sweet, which is entirely similar to \"blanc-mang\u00e9\", served at the best tables in France; it is a very healthy thing, and one of the most delicate things one can eat].\nIn the 17th century, the whitedish evolved into a meatless dessert pudding with cream and eggs, and later, gelatin. In the 19th century, arrowroot and cornflour were added, and the dish evolved into the modern blancmange.\nEtymology.\nThe word blancmange derives from Old French . The name \"whitedish\" is a modern term used by some historians, though the name historically was either a direct translation from or a calque of the Old French term. Many different local or regional terms were used for the dish in the Middle Ages as translations of the French term:\nThough it is fairly certain that the etymology is indeed \"white dish\", medieval sources are not always consistent as to the actual colour of the dish. Food scholar Terence Scully has proposed the alternative etymology of , \"bland dish\", reflecting its often mild and \"dainty\" (in this context meaning refined and aristocratic) taste and popularity as a dish for the sick.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In its most literal sense, a melody is a combination of pitch and rhythm, while more figuratively, the term can include other musical elements such as tonal color. It is the foreground to the background accompaniment. A line or part need not be a foreground melody.\nMelodies often consist of one or more musical phrases or motifs, and are usually repeated throughout a composition in various forms. Melodies may also be described by their melodic motion or the pitches or the intervals between pitches (predominantly conjunct or disjunct or with further restrictions), pitch range, tension and release, continuity and coherence, cadence, and shape.\nFunction and elements.\nJohann Philipp Kirnberger argued:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The true goal of music\u2014its proper enterprise\u2014is melody. All the parts of harmony have as their ultimate purpose only beautiful melody. Therefore, the question of which is the more significant, melody or harmony, is futile. Beyond doubt, the means is subordinate to the end.\u2014\u200a\nThe Norwegian composer Marcus Paus has argued:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Melody is to music what a scent is to the senses: it jogs our memory. It gives face to form, and identity and character to the process and proceedings. It is not only a musical subject, but a manifestation of the musically subjective. It carries and radiates personality with as much clarity and poignancy as harmony and rhythm combined. As such a powerful tool of communication, melody serves not only as protagonist in its own drama, but as messenger from the author to the audience.\u2014\u200a\nGiven the many and varied elements and styles of melody \"many extant explanations [of melody] confine us to specific stylistic models, and they are too exclusive.\" Paul Narveson claimed in 1984 that more than three-quarters of melodic topics had not been explored thoroughly.\nThe melodies existing in most European music written before the 20th century, and popular music throughout the 20th century, featured \"fixed and easily discernible frequency patterns\", recurring \"events, often periodic, at all structural levels\" and \"recurrence of durations and patterns of durations\".\nMelodies in the 20th century \"utilized a greater variety of pitch resources than ha[d] been the custom in any other historical period of Western music.\" While the diatonic scale was still used, the chromatic scale became \"widely employed.\" Composers also allotted a structural role to \"the qualitative dimensions\" that previously had been \"almost exclusively reserved for pitch and rhythm\". Kliewer states, \"The essential elements of any melody are duration, pitch, and quality (timbre), texture, and loudness. Though the same melody may be recognizable when played with a wide variety of timbres and dynamics, the latter may still be an \"element of linear ordering.\"\nExamples.\nDifferent musical styles use melody in different ways.

He won the Nebula Award three times (out of 14 nominations) and the Hugo Award six times (also out of 14 nominations), including two Hugos for novels: the serialized novel \"...And Call Me Conrad\" (1965), subsequently published under the title \"This Immortal\" (1966), and the novel \"Lord of Light\" (1967).\nBiography.\nZelazny was born in Euclid, Ohio, the only child of Polish immigrant Joseph Frank \u017belazny and Irish-American Josephine Flora Sweet. In high school, he became the editor of the school newspaper and joined the Creative Writing Club. In the fall of 1955, he began attending Western Reserve University and graduated with a B.A. in English in 1959. He was accepted to Columbia University in New York, and he specialized in Elizabethan and Jacobean drama, graduating with an M.A. in 1962. His dissertation was titled \"Two Traditions and Cyril Tourneur: an Examination of Morality and Humor Comedy Conventions in \"The Revenger's Tragedy\"\".\nBetween 1962 and 1969, he worked for the US Social Security Administration in Cleveland, Ohio, and then in Baltimore, Maryland, spending his evenings writing science fiction. He deliberately progressed from short-shorts to novelettes to novellas and finally to novel-length works by 1965. On May 1, 1969, he quit his job to become a full-time writer, and thereafter he concentrated on writing novels in order to maintain his income. During this period, he was an active and vocal member of the Baltimore Science Fiction Society, whose members included the writer Jack L. Chalker, in addition to Joe and Jack Haldeman, among others.\nHis first appearance in a fanzine was with part one of the story \"Conditional Benefit\" (\"Thurban 1\" #3, 1953); his first professional publication and sale was the fantasy short story \"Mr. Fuller's Revolt\" (\"Literary Calvalcade\", 1954). As a professional writer, his debut works were the simultaneous publication of \"Passion Play\" (\"Amazing\", August 1962) and \"Horseman!\" (\"Fantastic\", August 1962). \"Passion Play\" was written and sold first. His first story to attract major attention was \"A Rose for Ecclesiastes\", published in \"The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction\", with cover art by Hannes Bok.\nRoger Zelazny was also a member of the Swordsmen and Sorcerers' Guild of America (SAGA), a loose-knit group of heroic fantasy authors founded in the 1960s, some of whose works were anthologized in Lin Carter's \"Flashing Swords!\" anthologies.\nPersonal life and death.\nZelazny was married twice\u2014first to Sharon Steberl in 1964 (divorced, no children), and then to Judith Alene Callahan in 1966. Before this period, he was engaged to folk singer Hedy West for six months from 1961 to 1962. Roger and Judith had two sons, Devin and Trent (who was an author of crime fiction, deceased), and a daughter, Shannon. At the time of his death, Roger and Judith were separated, and he was living with author Jane Lindskold.\nRaised as a Catholic by his parents, Zelazny later declared himself a lapsed Catholic and remained that way for the rest of his life. \"I did have a strong Catholic background, but I am not a Catholic. Somewhere in the past, I believe I answered in the affirmative once for strange and complicated reasons. But I am not a member of any organized religion.\"\nZelazny died, aged 58, in Santa Fe on June 16, 1995, of kidney failure secondary to colorectal cancer. At the time of his death, he had been a resident of Santa Fe for twenty years.\nThemes.\nIn his stories, Zelazny frequently portrayed characters from myth, depicted in the modern or a future world. Mythological traditions that his fiction borrowed from include the following:\nAdditionally, elements from Norse, Japanese and Irish mythology, Arthurian legend, and real history appear in \"The Chronicles of Amber\" series. \"The novel A Night in the Lonesome October\" involves the Cthulhu Mythos, a shared fictional universe based on the work of H. P. Lovecraft.\nAnother recurring motif of Zelazny's is the \"absent father\" (or father-figure). Again, this motif occurs most notably in the Amber novels: in the first Amber series, the protagonist Corwin searches for his lost, god-like father Oberon; in the second series, which focuses on Corwin's son Merlin (not to be confused with the Arthurian Merlin), Corwin himself is strangely missing. This somewhat Freudian theme runs through almost every Zelazny novel to some degree. The novels \"Roadmarks\", \"Doorways in the Sand\", \"Changeling\", \"Madwand\", and \"A Dark Traveling\"; the short stories \"Dismal Light\", \"Godson\", and \"The Keys to December\"; and the \"Alien Speedway\" series all feature main characters who are either searching for or have lost their fathers. Zelazny's father, Joseph, died unexpectedly in 1962 and never knew of his son's successes as a writer.\nTwo other personal characteristics that influenced Zelazny's fiction were his expertise in martial arts and his addiction to tobacco. Zelazny became an expert with the \u00e9p\u00e9e in college; he thereby began a lifelong study of several martial arts, including judo, aikido (which he later taught as well, having gained a black belt), tai chi, and \"baguazhang\". In turn, many of his characters ably and knowledgeably use similar skills while dispatching their opponents. Zelazny was also a passionate cigarette and pipe smoker (until he quit in the early 1980s)\u2014so much so that he made many of his protagonists heavy smokers as well. However, he quit in order to improve his cardiovascular fitness for the martial arts; once he had quit, characters in his later novels and short stories stopped smoking also.\nZelazny also often experimented with form in his stories. The novel \"Doorways in the Sand\" practices a flashback technique in which most chapters open with a scene, typically involving peril, not implied by the end of the previous chapter. Once this scene is established, the narrator backtracks to the events leading up to it, and then he follows through to the end of the chapter, whereupon the next chapter jumps ahead to another dramatic \"non-sequitur\".\nIn \"Roadmarks\", a novel about a road system that links all possible times, places and histories, the chapters that feature the protagonist are all titled \"One\". Other chapters, titled \"Two\", feature secondary characters, including original characters, pulp heroes, and real historical figures. The \"One\" storyline is fairly linear, whereas the \"Two\" storyline jumps around in time and sequence. After finishing the manuscript, Zelazny shuffled the \"Two\" chapters randomly among the \"One\" chapters in order to emphasize their non-linear nature relative to the storyline.\nThe novel \"Creatures of Light and Darkness\", featuring characters in the personas of Egyptian gods, uses a narrative voice entirely in the present tense; the final chapter is structured as a play, and several chapters take the form of long poems.\nAnother common stylistic approach in Zelazny's novels is the use of \"mixed genres\", whereby elements of each are combined freely and interchangeably. The novels \"Jack of Shadows\" and \"Changeling\", for example, revolve around the tensions between the two worlds of magic and technology. The novel \"Lord of Light\", perhaps one of his most famous works, is written in the classic style of a mythic fantasy, while it is established early in the book that the story itself takes place on a colonized planet.\nLegacy.\nZelazny's stories inspired other authors in his generation including Samuel R. Delany, whose novel \"Nova\" and many of his short stories were written \"partly in response to Zelazny\u2019s eruption into the field.\" In 1967, Algis Budrys listed Zelazny, Delany, J. G. Ballard, and Brian Aldiss as \"an earthshaking new kind of\" writer, and leaders of the New Wave. Neil Gaiman said that Zelazny was the author who influenced him most, with this influence particularly seen in Gaiman's literary style and subjects. Andrzej Sapkowski considered Zelazny to be his spiritual teacher, whose work inspired him to write his first novel.\nThe anthology \"Lord of the Fantastic: Stories in Honor of Roger Zelazny\", edited by Martin H. Greenberg and released in 1998, featured essays and stories in honor of Zelazny by Walter Jon Williams, Jack Williamson, John Varley, Gaiman, Gregory Benford, and many other authors.\nThe anthology \"Shadows &amp; Reflections: A Roger Zelazny Tribute Anthology\", edited by Trent Zelazny and Warren Lapine, was released in 2017; it featured two essays and fifteen stories set in universes that Zelazny created. Contributors included Zelazny, George R.R. Martin, Shannon Zelazny, Warren Lapine, Steven Brust, Kelly McCullough, Jane Lindskold, Steve Perry, Gerald Hausman, Lawrence Watt-Evans, Michael H. Hanson, Mark Rich, Gio Clairval, Edward J. McFadden III, Theodore Krulik, Shariann Lewitt, and Jay O'Connell.\nAwards.\nZelazny won at least 16 awards for specific works of fiction: six Hugo Awards, three Nebula Awards, two Locus Awards, one Prix Tour-Apollo Award, two Seiun Awards, and two Balrog Awards. Often Zelazny's works competed with each other for the same award.\nIn addition, Zelazny was the Guest of Honor at the Worldcon convention in Washington, D.C., in 1974 (also known as Discon II); he won an Inkpot Award for lifetime achievement at the San Diego Comic-Con convention in 1993. \"A Rose for Ecclesiastes\" was included in \"Visions of Mars: First Library on Mars\", a DVD taken on board the \"Phoenix Mars Lander\" in 2008.\nTributes.\nThe ostracod (class of crustaceans) \"Sclerocypris zelaznyi\" was named after Zelazny.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "37737", "revid": "4788526", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37737", "title": "The Invisible Man", "text": "1897 science fiction novel by H. G. Wells\nThe Invisible Man is an 1897 science fiction novel by H. G. Wells. Originally serialised in \"Pearson's Weekly\" in 1897, it was published as a novel the same year. The Invisible Man to whom the title refers is Griffin, a scientist who has devoted himself to research into optics and invents a way to change a body's refractive index to that of air so that it neither absorbs nor reflects light. He carries out this procedure on himself and renders himself invisible, but fails in his attempt to reverse it. A practitioner of random and irresponsible violence, Griffin has become an iconic character in horror fiction.\nWhile its predecessors, \"The Time Machine\" and \"The Island of Doctor Moreau\", were written using first-person narrators, Wells adopts a third-person objective point of view in \"The Invisible Man\". The novel is considered influential, and helped establish Wells as the \"father of science fiction\".\nPlot summary.\nA man named Griffin arrives at an inn owned by Mr. and Mrs. Hall of the English village of Iping, West Sussex, during a snowstorm. He wears a wide-brimmed hat, a long-sleeved, thick coat and gloves; his face is hidden entirely by bandages except for a prosthetic nose. He is reclusive, irascible, unfriendly, and introverted. He demands to be left alone and spends most of his time in his rooms working with chemicals and laboratory apparatus, only venturing out at night. He causes a lot of accidents, but when Mrs. Hall addresses this, Griffin demands that the cost of the damage be put on his bill. While he is staying at the inn, hundreds of glass bottles arrive. His odd behaviour becomes the talk of the village, with many theorizing as to his origins.\nMeanwhile, a burglary occurs in the village, but no suspect is found. Running short of money, Griffin is unable to pay for his lodging and meals. When his landlady threatens to kick him out, he reveals his invisibility to her in a fit of anger. An attempt to apprehend him by the police is thwarted when he undresses to take advantage of his invisibility, fights off his would-be captors, and flees.\nAt the South Downs, Griffin coerces a tramp, Thomas Marvel, to become his assistant. With Marvel, he returns to the village to recover three notebooks that contain records of his experiments. Marvel attempts to betray Griffin, who threatens to kill him. Marvel escapes to the seaside town of Port Burdock, pursued to an inn by Griffin, who is shot by one of the bar patrons.\nGriffin takes shelter in a nearby house that turns out to belong to Dr. Kemp, a former acquaintance from medical school. To Kemp, he reveals his true identity: an albino former medical student who left medicine to devote himself to the science of optics.\nGriffin tells the story of how he invented chemicals capable of rendering bodies invisible, which he first tried on a cat, then himself, how he burned down the boarding house he was staying in to cover his tracks, found himself ill-equipped to survive in the open, stole clothes from a theatrical supply shop on Drury Lane, and then headed to Iping to attempt to reverse the invisibility. Having been driven insane by the procedure and his experiences, Griffin now imagines that he can make Kemp his secret confederate, describing a plan to use his invisibility to terrorise the nation.\nKemp has already denounced Griffin to the local authorities, led by Port Burdock's chief of police, Colonel Adye, and waits for help to arrive while listening to this wild proposal. When Adye and his men arrive, Griffin fights his way out and the next day leaves a note announcing that Kemp will be the first man to be killed in the \"Reign of Terror\". Kemp tries to organise a plan to use himself as bait to trap the invisible man, but a note that he sends is stolen from his servant by Griffin. During the chase, Griffin arms himself with an iron bar and kills a bystander.\nGriffin shoots Adye, then breaks into Kemp's house. Adye's constables fend him off and Kemp bolts for the town, where the locals come to his aid. Still obsessed with killing Kemp, Griffin nearly strangles him but is cornered, seized, and beaten by the enraged mob, his last words a cry for mercy. Kemp urges the mob to stand away and tries to save Griffin's life, though unsuccessfully. Griffin's battered body becomes visible as he dies. A policeman has someone cover Griffin's face with a sheet.\nIt is later revealed that Marvel has secretly kept Griffin's notes and\u2014with the help of the stolen money\u2014 becomes a successful businessman, running the \"Invisible Man Inn\". However, when not running his inn, Marvel tries to decipher the notes, hoping of one day recreating Griffin's work. However, because pages were accidentally washed clean, and the remaining notes are coded in Greek and Latin, and Marvel has no comprehension of even the basic mathematical symbols he sees in the notes, this is unlikely.\nBackground.\nAccording to John Sutherland, Wells and his contemporaries such as Arthur Conan Doyle, Robert Louis Stevenson and Rudyard Kipling \"essentially wrote boy's books for grown-ups.\" Sutherland identifies \"The Invisible Man\" as one such book. Wells said that his inspiration for the novella was \"The Perils of Invisibility\", one of the \"Bab Ballads\" by W. S. Gilbert, which includes the couplet \"Old Peter vanished like a shot/but then \u2013 his suit of clothes did not.\" Another influence on \"The Invisible Man\" was Plato's \"Republic\", a book which had a significant effect on Wells when he read it as an adolescent. In the second book of the \"Republic\", Glaucon recounts the legend of the Ring of Gyges, which posits that, if a man were made invisible and could act with impunity, he would \"go about among men with the powers of a god.\" Wells wrote the original version of the tale between March and June 1896. This version was a 25,000 word short story titled \"The Man at the Coach and Horses\" with which Wells was dissatisfied, so he extended it.\nScientific accuracy.\nRussian writer Yakov I. Perelman pointed out in \"Physics Can Be Fun\" (1913) that from a scientific point of view, a man made invisible by Griffin's method should have been blind because a human eye works by absorbing incoming light, not letting it through completely. Wells seems to show some awareness of this problem in Chapter 20, where the eyes of an otherwise invisible cat retain visible retinas.\nLegacy.\n\"The Invisible Man\" has been adapted for, and referred to in, film, television, audio drama, and comics. Allen Grove, professor of English at Alfred University states,\n\"The Invisible Man\" has a wealth of progeny. The novel was adapted into comic book form by \"Classics Illustrated\" in the 1950s, and by Marvel Comics in 1976. Many writers and film-makers also created sequels to the story, something the novel\u2019s ambiguous ending encourages. Over a dozen movies and television series are based on the novel, including a 1933 James Whale film and a 1984 series by the BBC. The novel has been adapted for radio numerous times, including a 2017 audio version starring John Hurt as the invisible man. It was adapted by playwright Arthur Yorinks in 2009 for WNYC's https:// setting the multimedia play in a New York City homeless shelter. The cultural pervasiveness of \"The Invisible Man\" has led to everything from his cameo in an episode of \"Tom and Jerry\" to the Queen song \"The Invisible Man\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
