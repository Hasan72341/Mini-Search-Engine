Its Latin name means \"greater (or larger) bear\", referring to and contrasting it with nearby Ursa Minor, the lesser bear. In antiquity, it was one of the original 48 constellations listed by Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD, drawing on earlier works by Greek, Egyptian, Babylonian, and Assyrian astronomers. Today it is the third largest of the 88 modern constellations.\nUrsa Major is primarily known from the asterism of its main seven stars, which has been called the \"Big Dipper\", \"the Wagon\", \"Charles's Wain\", or \"the Plough\", among other names. In particular, the Big Dipper's stellar configuration mimics the shape of the \"Little Dipper\". Two of its stars, named Dubhe and Merak (\u03b1 Ursae Majoris and \u03b2 Ursae Majoris), can be used as the navigational pointer towards the place of the current northern pole star, Polaris in Ursa Minor.\nUrsa Major, along with asterisms it contains or overlaps, is significant to numerous world cultures, often as a symbol of the north. Its depiction on the flag of Alaska is a modern example of such symbolism.\nUrsa Major is visible throughout the year from most of the Northern Hemisphere, and appears circumpolar above the mid-northern latitudes. From southern temperate latitudes, the main asterism is invisible, but the southern parts of the constellation can still be viewed.\nCharacteristics.\nUrsa Major covers 1279.66 square degrees or 3.10% of the total sky, making it the third largest constellation. In 1930, Eug\u00e8ne Delporte set its official International Astronomical Union (IAU) constellation boundaries, defining it as a 28-sided irregular polygon. In the equatorial coordinate system, the constellation stretches between the right ascension coordinates of 08h 08.3m and 14h 29.0m and the declination coordinates of +28.30\u00b0 and +73.14\u00b0. Ursa Major borders eight other constellations: Draco to the north and northeast, Bo\u00f6tes to the east, Canes Venatici to the east and southeast, Coma Berenices to the southeast, Leo and Leo Minor to the south, Lynx to the southwest and Camelopardalis to the northwest. The three-letter constellation abbreviation \"UMa\" was adopted by the IAU in 1922.\nFeatures.\nAsterisms.\nThe outline of the seven bright stars of Ursa Major form the asterism known as the \"Big Dipper\" in the United States and Canada, while in the United Kingdom it is called the \"Plough\"\u200a or (historically) \"Charles' Wain\". Six of the seven stars are of second magnitude or higher, and it forms one of the best-known patterns in the sky. As many of its common names allude, its shape is said to resemble a ladle, an agricultural plough, or wagon. In the context of Ursa Major, they are commonly drawn to represent the hindquarters and tail of the Great Bear. Starting with the \"ladle\" portion of the dipper and extending clockwise (eastward in the sky) through the handle, these stars are the following:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Flowlist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExcept for \"Dubhe\" and \"Alkaid\", the stars of the Big Dipper all have proper motions heading toward a common point in Sagittarius. A few other such stars have been identified, and together they are called the Ursa Major Moving Group.\nThe stars Merak (\u03b2 Ursae Majoris) and Dubhe (\u03b1 Ursae Majoris) are known as the \"pointer stars\" because they are helpful for finding Polaris, also known as the North Star or Pole Star. By visually tracing a line from Merak through Dubhe (1 unit) and continuing for 5 units, one's eye will land on Polaris, accurately indicating true north.\nAnother asterism is recognized in Arab culture as representing three pairs of footprints of a leaping gazelle. It is a series of three pairs of stars found along the southern border of the constellation. From southeast to southwest, the \"first leap\", comprising \u03bd and \u03be Ursae Majoris (Alula Borealis and Australis, respectively); the \"second leap\", comprising \u03bb and \u03bc Ursae Majoris (Tania Borealis and Australis); and the \"third leap\", comprising \u03b9 and \u03ba Ursae Majoris (Talitha and Alkaphrah). The same asterism has the Chinese name \"Santai\" and the Indian name \"Trivikrama\", both meaning \"three steps\".\nOther stars.\nW Ursae Majoris is the prototype of a class of contact binary variable stars, and ranges between magnitudes 7.75 and 8.48.\n47 Ursae Majoris is a Sun-like star with a three-planet system. 47 Ursae Majoris b, discovered in 1996, orbits every 1078 days and is 2.53 times the mass of Jupiter. 47 Ursae Majoris c, discovered in 2001, orbits every 2391 days and is 0.54 times the mass of Jupiter. 47 Ursae Majoris d, discovered in 2010, has an uncertain period, lying between 8907 and 19097 days; it is 1.64 times the mass of Jupiter. The star is of magnitude 5.0 and is approximately 46 light-years from Earth.\nThe star TYC 3429-697-1 (9h 40m 44s \u00b0\u00a014\u2032\u00a02\u2033), located to the east of \u03b8 Ursae Majoris and to the southwest of the \"Big Dipper\") has been recognized as the state star of Delaware, and is informally known as the Delaware Diamond.\nDeep-sky objects.\nSeveral bright galaxies are found in Ursa Major, including the pair Messier 81 (one of the brightest galaxies in the sky) and Messier 82 above the bear's head, and Pinwheel Galaxy (M101), a spiral northeast of Alkaid. The spiral galaxies Messier 108 and Messier 109 are also found in this constellation. The bright planetary nebula Owl Nebula (M97) can be found along the bottom of the bowl of the Big Dipper.\nM81 is a nearly face-on spiral galaxy 11.8\u00a0million light-years from Earth. Like most spiral galaxies, it has a core made up of old stars, with arms filled with young stars and nebulae. Along with M82, it is a part of the galaxy cluster closest to the Local Group.\nM82 is a nearly edgewise galaxy that is interacting gravitationally with M81. It is the brightest infrared galaxy in the sky. SN 2014J, an apparent Type Ia supernova, was observed in M82 on 21 January 2014.\nM97, also called the Owl Nebula, is a planetary nebula 1,630 light-years from Earth; it has a magnitude of approximately 10. It was discovered in 1781 by Pierre M\u00e9chain.\nM101, also called the Pinwheel Galaxy, is a face-on spiral galaxy located 25 million light-years from Earth. It was discovered by Pierre M\u00e9chain in 1781. Its spiral arms have regions with extensive star formation and have strong ultraviolet emissions. It has an integrated magnitude of 7.5, making it visible in both binoculars and telescopes, but not to the naked eye.\nNGC 2787 is a lenticular galaxy at a distance of 24 million light-years. Unlike most lenticular galaxies, NGC 2787 has a bar at its center. It also has a halo of globular clusters, indicating its age and relative stability.\nNGC 2950 is a lenticular galaxy located 60 million light-years from Earth.\nNGC 3000 is a double star, and catalogued as a nebula-type object.\nNGC 3079 is a starburst spiral galaxy located 52 million light-years from Earth. It has a horseshoe-shaped structure at its center that indicates the presence of a supermassive black hole. The structure itself is formed by superwinds from the black hole.\nNGC 3310 is another starburst spiral galaxy located 50 million light-years from Earth. Its bright white color is caused by its higher than usual rate of star formation, which began 100\u00a0million years ago after a merger. Studies of this and other starburst galaxies have shown that their starburst phase can last for hundreds of millions of years, far longer than was previously assumed.\nNGC 4013 is an edge-on spiral galaxy located 55 million light-years from Earth. It has a prominent dust lane and has several visible star forming regions.\nI Zwicky 18 is a young dwarf galaxy at a distance of 45 million light-years. The youngest-known galaxy in the visible universe, I\u00a0Zwicky 18 is about 4\u00a0million years old, about one-thousandth the age of the Solar System. It is filled with star forming regions which are creating many hot, young, blue stars at a very high rate.\nThe Hubble Deep Field is located to the northeast of \u03b4 Ursae Majoris.\nExtrasolar planets.\nHD 80606, a sun-like star in a binary system, orbits a common center of gravity with its partner, HD 80607; the two are separated by 1,200\u00a0AU on average. Research conducted in 2003 indicates that its sole planet, HD 80606 b is a future hot Jupiter, modeled to have evolved in a perpendicular orbit around 5\u00a0AU from its sun. The 4-Jupiter mass planet is projected to eventually move into a circular, more aligned orbit via the Kozai mechanism. However, it is currently on an incredibly eccentric orbit that ranges from approximately one astronomical unit at its apoapsis and six stellar radii at periapsis.\nHistory.\nUrsa Major has been reconstructed as an Indo-European constellation. It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century AD astronomer Ptolemy in his \"Almagest\", who called it Arktos Megale. \nMythology.\nThe constellation of Ursa Major has been seen as a bear, usually female, by multiple connected civilizations. This may stem from a common oral tradition of Cosmic Hunt myths stretching back more than 13,000 years. Using statistical and phylogenetic tools, Julien d'Huy reconstructs the following Palaeolithic state of the story: \"There is an animal that is a horned herbivore, especially an elk. One human pursues this ungulate. The hunt locates or get to the sky. The animal is alive when it is transformed into a constellation. It forms the Big Dipper.\"\nArabian folklore.\nWhilst the Pre-Islamic Arabs recognised the larger constellation of Ursa Major as being a bear, perhaps due to Greek influence, they had traditionally always recognised the Big Dipper and Ursa Minor as being counterparts. Both were imagined as funeral processions with the ladle of either seen as a funerary bier and its handle as a train of mourners. The Big Dipper is known as \"ban\u0101t an-na'sh al-kubr\u0101\" meaning literally \"the greater daughters of the bier\". However daughters here means \"those pertaining to it\", i.e. \"the mourners\" and thus is better translated as \"the greater funeral procession\", whilst Ursa Minor is known as \"the lesser funeral procession\". There is also a legend that the body on the bier is the father of those following behind it, a man called \"Na'ash\" who was murdered by \"Al-judayy\" (the Arabic name for the North Star) and whom the funeral procession is in pursuit of.\nGreco-Roman tradition.\nIn Greek mythology, Zeus (the king of the gods, known as Jupiter in Roman mythology) lusts after a young woman named Callisto, a nymph of Artemis (known to the Romans as Diana). Zeus's jealous wife Hera (Juno to the Romans) discovers that Callisto has a son named Arcas as the result of her rape by Zeus and transforms Callisto into a bear as a punishment. Callisto, while in bear form, later encounters her son Arcas. Arcas almost spears the bear, but to avert the tragedy Zeus whisks them both into the sky, Callisto as Ursa Major and Arcas as the constellation Bo\u00f6tes. Ovid called Ursa Major the Parrhasian Bear, since Callisto came from Parrhasia in Arcadia, where the story is set.\nThe Greek poet Aratus called the constellation Helike, (\"turning\" or \"twisting\"), because it turns around the celestial pole. The Odyssey notes that it is the sole constellation that never sinks below the horizon and \"bathes in the Ocean's waves\", so it is used as a celestial reference point for navigation. It has also been called the \"Wain\" or \"Plaustrum\", a Latin word referring to a \u200dhorse-drawn \u200dcart.\nHindu tradition.\nIn Hinduism, The earliest mention of Ursa Major/Big dipper/ Great Bear is known as Saptarshi, each of the stars representing one of the Saptarishis or Seven Sages (Rishis) viz. Bhrigu, Atri, Angiras, Vasishtha, Pulastya, Pulaha, and Kratu. is found in the Rigveda (c. 1500\u20131200 BCE), one of the oldest known texts in human history.\nReferences in Ancient Indian Texts:\n1. Rigveda (Mandala 1, Hymn 24.10). Mentions the Saptarishi in connection with celestial order and cosmic significance.\n2. Mahabharata (c. 400 BCE \u2013 400 CE). Discusses Saptarishi Mandal as a guiding star for navigation.\n3. Puranas (Vishnu Purana, Brahmanda Purana, and others). Describe the Saptarishis as divine sages who hold cosmic wisdom.\nFor Ursa Minor, it was not explicitly mentioned in early Vedic texts but was recognized in later astronomical texts such as:\n1. Vedanga Jyotisha (c. 1400\u20131200 BCE)\n2. Surya Siddhanta (c. 4th century CE)\nThe fact that the two front stars of the constellations point to the pole star is explained as the boon given to the boy sage Dhruva by Lord Vishnu.\nThus, the Rigveda holds the earliest recorded mention of Ursa Major, while Ursa Minor gained prominence in later astronomical traditions.\nIn Judaism and Christianity.\nUrsa Major may be mentioned in the biblical book of Job, dated between the 7th and 4th centuries BC, although this is often disputed.\nEast Asian traditions.\nIn China and Japan, the Big Dipper is called the \"North Dipper\" (Chinese: , Japanese: ), and in ancient times, each one of the seven stars had a specific name, often coming themselves from ancient China:\n* \"Pivot\" (C: \"sh\u016b\" J: \"s\u016b\") is for Dubhe (Alpha Ursae Majoris)\n* \"Beautiful jade\" (C: \"xu\u00e1n\" J: \"sen\") is for Merak (Beta Ursae Majoris)\n* \"Pearl\" (C: \"j\u012b\" J: \"ki\") is for Phecda (Gamma Ursae Majoris)\n* \"Balance\" (C: \"qu\u00e1n\" J: \"ken\") is for Megrez (Delta Ursae Majoris)\n* \"Measuring rod of jade\" (C: \"y\u00f9h\u00e9ng\" J: \"gyokk\u014d\") is for Alioth (Epsilon Ursae Majoris)\n* \"Opening of the Yang\" (C: \"k\u0101iy\u00e1ng\" J: \"kaiy\u014d\") is for Mizar (Zeta Ursae Majoris)\n* Alkaid (Eta Ursae Majoris) has several nicknames: \"Sword\" (C: \"ji\u00e0n\" J: \"ken\") (short form from \"End of the sword\" (C: \"ji\u00e0n xi\u0101n\" J: \"ken saki\")), \"Flickering light\" (C: \"y\u00e1ogu\u0101ng\" J: \"y\u014dk\u014d\"), or again \"Star of military defeat\" (C: \"p\u00f3j\u016bn x\u012bng\" J: \"hagun sei\"), because travel in the direction of this star was regarded as bad luck for an army.\nIn Shinto, the seven largest stars of Ursa Major belong to Ame-no-Minakanushi, the oldest and most powerful of all kami.\nIn South Korea, the constellation is referred to as \"the seven stars of the north\". In the related myth, a widow with seven sons found comfort with a widower, but to get to his house required crossing a stream. The seven sons, sympathetic to their mother, placed stepping stones in the river. Their mother, not knowing who put the stones in place, blessed them and, when they died, they became the constellation.\nNative American traditions.\nThe Iroquois interpreted Alioth, Mizar, and Alkaid as three hunters pursuing the Great Bear. According to one version of their myth, the first hunter (Alioth) is carrying a bow and arrow to strike down the bear. The second hunter (Mizar) carries a large pot \u2013 the star Alcor \u2013 on his shoulder in which to cook the bear while the third hunter (Alkaid) hauls a pile of firewood to light a fire beneath the pot.\nThe Lakota people call the constellation \"\", or \"Great Bear\".\nThe Wampanoag people (Algonquian) referred to Ursa Major as \"maske\", meaning \"bear\" according to Thomas Morton in The New England Canaan.\nThe Wasco-Wishram Native Americans interpreted the constellation as five wolves and two bears that were left in the sky by Coyote.\nGermanic traditions.\nTo Norse pagans, the Big Dipper was known as \"\u00d3\u00f0ins vagn\", \"Woden's wagon\". Likewise Woden is poetically referred to by Kennings such as \"vagna verr\" 'guardian of the wagon' or \"vagna r\u00fani\" 'confidant of the wagon'\nUralic traditions.\nIn the Finnish language, the asterism is sometimes called by its old Finnish name, Otava. The meaning of the name has been almost forgotten in Modern Finnish; it means a salmon weir. Ancient Finns believed the bear (\"Ursus arctos\") was lowered to earth in a golden basket off the Ursa Major, and when a bear was killed, its head was positioned on a tree to allow the bear's spirit to return to Ursa Major.\nIn the S\u00e1mi languages of Northern Europe, part of the constellation (i.e. the Big Dipper minus Dubhe and Merak, is identified as the bow of the great hunter F\u00e1vdna (the star Arcturus). In the main S\u00e1mi language, North S\u00e1mi, it is called \"F\u00e1vdnad\u00e1vgi\" (\"F\u00e1vdna's Bow\") or simply \"d\u00e1vgg\u00e1t\" (\"the Bow\"). The constellation features prominently in the S\u00e1mi anthem, which begins with the words \"Guhkkin davvin d\u00e1vggaid vuolde sabm\u00e1 suolggai S\u00e1mieanan\", which translates to \"Far to the north, under the Bow, the Land of the S\u00e1mi slowly comes into view.\" The Bow is an important part of the S\u00e1mi traditional narrative about the night sky, in which various hunters try to chase down \"Sarva\", the Great Reindeer, a large constellation that takes up almost half the sky. According to the legend, F\u00e1vdna stands ready to fire his Bow every night but hesitates because he might hit Stella Polaris, known as \"Boahji\" (\"the Rivet\"), which would cause the sky to collapse and end the world.\nSoutheast Asian traditions.\nIn Burmese, \"Pucwan T\u0101r\u0101\" (\u1015\u102f\u1007\u103d\u1014\u103a \u1010\u102c\u101b\u102c, ) is the name of a constellation comprising stars from the head and forelegs of Ursa Major; \"pucwan\" (\u1015\u102f\u1007\u103d\u1014\u103a) is a general term for a crustacean, such as prawn, shrimp, crab, lobster, etc.\nIn Javanese, it is known as \"lintang jong\", which means \"the jong constellation\". Likewise, in Malay it is called \"bintang jong\".\nEsoteric lore.\nIn Theosophy, it is believed that the \"Seven Stars of the Pleiades\" focus the spiritual energy of the seven rays from the \"Galactic Logos\" to the \"Seven Stars of the Great Bear\", then to Sirius, then to the Sun, then to the god of Earth (Sanat Kumara), and finally through the seven Masters of the Seven Rays to the human race.\nIn culture.\nUrsa Major is mentioned by such poets as Homer, Spenser, Shakespeare, Tennyson and also by Federico Garcia Lorca, in \"Song for the Moon\". Ancient Finnish poetry also refers to the constellation, and it features in the painting \"Starry Night Over the Rh\u00f4ne\" by Vincent van Gogh. \nGraphic visualisation.\nIn European star charts, the constellation was visualized with the 'square' of the Big Dipper forming the bear's body and the chain of stars forming the Dipper's \"handle\" as a long tail. However, bears do not have long tails, and Jewish astronomers considered Alioth, Mizar, and Alkaid instead to be three cubs following their mother, while the Native Americans saw them as three hunters.\nNoted children's book author H. A. Rey, in his 1952 book \",\" () had a different asterism in mind for Ursa Major, that instead had the \"bear\" image of the constellation oriented with Alkaid as the tip of the bear's nose, and the \"handle\" of the Big Dipper part of the constellation forming the outline of the top of the bear's head and neck, rearwards to the shoulder, potentially giving it the longer head and neck of a polar bear.\nUrsa Major is also pictured as the Starry Plough, the Irish flag of Labour, adopted by James Connolly's Irish Citizen Army in 1916, which shows the constellation on a blue background; on the state flag of Alaska; and on the House of Bernadotte's variation of the coat of arms of Sweden. The seven stars on a red background of the flag of the Community of Madrid, Spain, may be the stars of the Plough asterism (or of Ursa Minor). The same can be said of the seven stars pictured in the bordure azure of the coat of arms of Madrid, capital of that country.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As with the Great Bear, the tail of the Little Bear may also be seen as the handle of a ladle, hence the North American name, Little Dipper: seven stars with four in its bowl like its partner the Big Dipper. Ursa Minor was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, and remains one of the 88 modern constellations. Ursa Minor has traditionally been important for navigation, particularly by mariners, because of Polaris being the north pole star.\nPolaris, the brightest star in the constellation, is a yellow-white supergiant and the brightest Cepheid variable star in the night sky, ranging in apparent magnitude from 1.97 to 2.00. Beta Ursae Minoris, also known as Kochab, is an aging star that has swollen and cooled to become an orange giant with an apparent magnitude of 2.08, only slightly fainter than Polaris. Kochab and 3rd-magnitude Gamma Ursae Minoris have been called the \"guardians of the pole star\" or \"Guardians of The Pole\". Planets have been detected orbiting four of the stars, including Kochab. The constellation also contains an isolated neutron star\u2014Calvera\u2014and H1504+65, the second-hottest white dwarf yet discovered, with a surface temperature of 200,000 K.\nHistory and mythology.\nIn the Babylonian star catalogues, Ursa Minor was known as the \"Wagon of Heaven\" (, also associated with the goddess Damkina). It is listed in the MUL.APIN catalogue, compiled around 1000\u00a0BC, among the \"Stars of Enlil\"\u2014that is, the northern sky.\nAccording to Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, citing Callimachus, Thales of Miletus \"measured the stars of the Wagon by which the Phoenicians sail\". Diogenes identifies these as the constellation of Ursa Minor, which for its reported use by the Phoenicians for navigation at sea were also named \"Phoinik\u0113\".\nThe tradition of naming the northern constellations \"bears\" appears to be genuinely Greek, although Homer refers to just a single \"bear\".\nThe original \"bear\" is thus Ursa Major, and Ursa Minor was admitted as the second, or \"Phoenician Bear\" (Ursa Phoenicia, hence \u03a6\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7, Phoenice)\nonly later, according to Strabo (I.1.6, C3) due to a suggestion by Thales, who suggested it as a navigation aid to the Greeks, who had been navigating by Ursa Major. In classical antiquity, the celestial pole was somewhat closer to Beta Ursae Minoris than to Alpha Ursae Minoris, and the entire constellation was taken to indicate the northern direction. Since the medieval period, it has become convenient to use Alpha Ursae Minoris (or \"Polaris\") as the North Star. (Even though, in the medieval period, Polaris was still several degrees away from the celestial pole. ) Now, Polaris is within 1\u00b0 of the north celestial pole and remains the current Pole star. Its Neo-Latin name of \"stella polaris\" was coined only in the early modern period.\nAnother ancient name of the constellation is \"Cynosura\" (Greek \u039a\u03c5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c3\u03bf\u03cd\u03c1\u03b1 \"dog's tail\").\nThe origin of this name is unclear (Ursa Minor being a \"dog's tail\" would imply that another constellation nearby is \"the dog\", but no such constellation is known).\nInstead, the mythographic tradition of \"Catasterismi\" makes \"Cynosura\" the name of an Oread nymph described as a nurse of Zeus, honoured by the god with a place in the sky.\nThere are various proposed explanations for the name \"Cynosura\". One suggestion connects it to the myth of Callisto, with her son Arcas replaced by her dog being placed in the sky by Zeus.\nOthers have suggested that an archaic interpretation of Ursa Major was that of a cow, forming a group with Bo\u00f6tes as herdsman, and Ursa Minor as a dog. George William Cox explained it as a variant of \u039b\u03c5\u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1, understood as \"wolf's tail\" but by him etymologized as \"trail, or train, of light\" (i.e. \u03bb\u03cd\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 \"wolf\" vs. \u03bb\u03cd\u03ba- \"light\"). Allen points to the Old Irish name of the constellation, \"drag-blod\" \"fire trail\", for comparison.\nBrown (1899) suggested a non-Greek origin of the name (a loan from an Assyrian \"An\u2011nas-sur\u2011ra\" \"high-rising\").\nAn alternative myth tells of two bears that saved Zeus from his murderous father Cronus by hiding him on Mount Ida. Later Zeus set them in the sky, but their tails grew long from their being swung up into the sky by the god.\nBecause Ursa Minor consists of seven stars, the Latin word for \"north\" (\"i.e.\", where Polaris points) is \"septentrio\", from \"septem\" (seven) and \"triones\" (oxen), from seven oxen driving a plough, which the seven stars also resemble. This name has also been attached to the main stars of Ursa Major.\nIn Inuit astronomy, the three brightest stars \u2014 Polaris, Kochab, and Pherkad \u2014 were known as \"Nuutuittut\" (\"never moving\"), though the term is more frequently used in the singular to refer to Polaris alone. The Pole Star is too high in the sky at far northern latitudes to be of use in navigation. In Chinese astronomy, the main stars of Ursa Minor are divided between two asterisms:\n\u52fe\u9673 \"G\u00f2uch\u00e9n\" (Curved Array) (including \u03b1 UMi, \u03b4 UMi, \u03b5 UMi, \u03b6 UMi, \u03b7 UMi, \u03b8 UMi, \u03bb UMi) and\n\u5317\u6975 \"B\u011bij\u00ed\" (Northern Pole) (including \u03b2 UMi and \u03b3 UMi).\nCharacteristics.\nUrsa Minor is bordered by Camelopardalis to the west, Draco to the west, and Cepheus to the east. Covering 256\u00a0square degrees, it ranks 56th of the 88 constellations in size. Ursa Minor is colloquially known in the US as the Little Dipper because its seven brightest stars seem to form the shape of a dipper (ladle or scoop). The star at the end of the dipper handle is Polaris. Polaris can also be found by following a line through the two stars\u2014Alpha and Beta Ursae Majoris, popularly called the Pointers\u2014that form the end of the \"bowl\" of the Big Dipper, for 30 degrees (three upright fists at arms' length) across the night sky. The four stars constituting the bowl of the Little Dipper are of second, third, fourth, and fifth magnitudes, respectively, and provide an easy guide to determining what magnitude stars are visible, useful for city dwellers or testing one's eyesight.\nThe three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the IAU (International Astronomical Union) in 1922, is \"UMi\". The official constellation boundaries, as set by Belgian astronomer Eug\u00e8ne Delporte in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 22 segments (\"illustrated in infobox\"). In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between 08h 41.4m and 22h 54.0m, while the declination coordinates range from the north celestial pole to 65.40\u00b0 in the south. Its position in the far northern celestial hemisphere means that the whole constellation is visible only to observers in the northern hemisphere.\nFeatures.\nStars.\nThe German cartographer Johann Bayer used the Greek letters alpha to theta to label the most prominent stars in the constellation, while his countryman Johann Elert Bode subsequently added iota through phi. Only lambda and pi remain in use, likely because of their proximity to the north celestial pole. Within the constellation's borders, there are 39 stars brighter than or equal to apparent magnitude 6.5. \nThe traditional names of the main seven in Johann Bayer's ordering are:\nMarking the Little Bear's tail, Polaris, or Alpha Ursae Minoris, is the brightest star in the constellation, varying between apparent magnitudes 1.97 and 2.00 over a period of 3.97\u00a0days. Located around 432\u00a0light-years away from Earth, it is a yellow-white supergiant that varies between spectral types F7Ib and F8Ib, and has around 6\u00a0times the Sun's mass, 2,500\u00a0times its luminosity, and 45\u00a0times its radius. Polaris is the brightest Cepheid variable star visible from Earth. It is a triple star system, the supergiant primary star having two yellow-white main-sequence star companions that are 17 and 2,400\u00a0astronomical units (AU) distant and take 29.6 and 42,000\u00a0years respectively to complete one orbit.\nTraditionally called Kochab, Beta Ursae Minoris, at apparent magnitude 2.08, is slightly less bright than Polaris. Located around 131\u00a0light-years away from Earth, it is an orange giant\u2014an evolved star that has used up the hydrogen in its core and moved off the main sequence\u2014of spectral type K4III. Slightly variable over a period of 4.6\u00a0days, Kochab has had its mass estimated at 1.3\u00a0times that of the Sun via measurement of these oscillations. Kochab is 450 times more luminous than the Sun and has 42 times its diameter, with a surface temperature of approximately 4,130\u00a0K. Estimated to be around 2.95\u00a0billion years old, \u00b11\u00a0billion years, Kochab was announced to have a planetary companion around 6.1\u00a0times as massive as Jupiter with an orbit of 522\u00a0days.\nTraditionally known as Pherkad, Gamma Ursae Minoris has an apparent magnitude that varies between 3.04 and 3.09 roughly every 3.4\u00a0hours. It and Kochab have been termed the \"guardians of the pole star\". A white bright giant of spectral type A3II-III, with around 4.8\u00a0times the Sun's mass, 1,050\u00a0times its luminosity and 15\u00a0times its radius, it is 487\u00b18 light-years distant from Earth. Pherkad belongs to a class of stars known as Delta Scuti variables\u2014short period (six hours at most) pulsating stars that have been used as standard candles and as subjects to study asteroseismology. Also possibly a member of this class is Zeta Ursae Minoris, a white star of spectral type A3V, which has begun cooling, expanding and brightening. It is likely to have been a B3 main-sequence star and is now slightly variable. At magnitude 4.95 the dimmest of the seven stars of the Little Dipper is Eta Ursae Minoris. A yellow-white main-sequence star of spectral type F5V, it is 97 light-years distant. It is double the Sun's diameter, 1.4\u00a0times as massive, and shines with 7.4\u00a0times its luminosity. Nearby Zeta lies 5.00-magnitude Theta Ursae Minoris. Located 860 \u00b1 80\u00a0light-years distant, it is an orange giant of spectral type K5III that has expanded and cooled off the main sequence, and has an estimated diameter around 4.8\u00a0times that of the Sun.\nMaking up the handle of the Little Dipper are Delta Ursae Minoris, or Yildun, and Epsilon Ursae Minoris. Just over 3.5 degrees from the north celestial pole, Delta is a white main-sequence star of spectral type A1V with an apparent magnitude of 4.35, located 172\u00b11 light-years from Earth. It has around 2.8 times the diameter and 47 times the luminosity of the Sun. A triple star system, Epsilon Ursae Minoris shines with a combined average light of magnitude 4.22. A yellow giant of spectral type G5III, the primary is a RS Canum Venaticorum variable star. It is a spectroscopic binary, with a companion 0.36\u00a0AU distant, and a third star\u2014an orange main-sequence star of spectral type K0\u20148100\u00a0AU distant.\nLocated close to Polaris is Lambda Ursae Minoris, a red giant of spectral type M1III. It is a semiregular variable varying between magnitudes 6.35 and 6.45. The northerly nature of the constellation means that the variable stars can be observed all year: The red giant R Ursae Minoris is a semiregular variable varying from magnitude 8.5 to 11.5 over 328\u00a0days, while S Ursae Minoris is a long-period variable that ranges between magnitudes 8.0 and 11 over 331\u00a0days. Located south of Kochab and Pherkad towards Draco is RR Ursae Minoris, a red giant of spectral type M5III that is also a semiregular variable ranging from magnitude 4.44 to 4.85 over a period of 43.3\u00a0days. T Ursae Minoris is another red-giant variable star that has undergone a dramatic change in status\u2014from being a long-period (Mira) variable ranging from magnitude 7.8 to 15 over 310\u2013315 days, to being a semiregular variable. The star is thought to have undergone a shell helium flash\u2014a point where the shell of helium around the star's core reaches a critical mass and ignites\u2014marked by its abrupt change in variability in 1979. Z Ursae Minoris is a faint variable star that suddenly dropped 6\u00a0magnitudes in 1992 and was identified as one of a rare class of stars\u2014R Coronae Borealis variables.\nEclipsing variables are star systems that vary in brightness because of one star passing in front of the other rather than from any intrinsic change in luminosity. W Ursae Minoris is one such system, its magnitude ranging from 8.51 to 9.59 over 1.7 days. The combined spectrum of the system is A2V, but the masses of the two component stars are unknown. A slight change in the orbital period in 1973 suggests there is a third component of the multiple star system\u2014most likely a red dwarf\u2014with an orbital period of 62.2\u00b13.9 years. RU Ursae Minoris is another example, ranging from 10 to 10.66 over 0.52\u00a0days. It is a semidetached system, as the secondary star is filling its Roche lobe and transferring matter to the primary.\nRW Ursae Minoris is a cataclysmic variable star system that flared up as a nova in 1956, reaching magnitude 6. In 2003, it was still two magnitudes brighter than its baseline, and dimming at a rate of 0.02 magnitude a year. Its distance has been calculated as 5,000\u00b1800\u00a0parsecs (16,300\u00a0light-years), which puts its location in the galactic halo.\nTaken from the villain in \"The Magnificent Seven\", Calvera is the nickname given to an X-ray source known as 1RXS J141256.0+792204 in the \"ROSAT All-Sky Survey Bright Source Catalog\" (RASS/BSC). It has been identified as an isolated neutron star, one of the closest of its kind to Earth. Ursa Minor has two enigmatic white dwarfs. Documented on January 27, 2011, H1504+65 is a faint (magnitude 15.9) star with the hottest surface temperature\u2014200,000 K\u2014yet discovered for a white dwarf. Its atmosphere, composed of roughly half carbon, half oxygen and 2% neon, is devoid of hydrogen and helium\u2014its composition unexplainable by current models of stellar evolution. WD 1337+705 is a cooler white dwarf that has magnesium and silicon in its spectrum, suggesting a companion or circumstellar disk, though no evidence for either has come to light. WISE 1506+7027 is a brown dwarf of spectral type T6 that is a mere light-years away from Earth. A faint object of magnitude 14, it was discovered by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) in 2011.\nKochab aside, three more stellar systems have been discovered to contain planets. 11 Ursae Minoris is an orange giant of spectral type K4III around 1.8\u00a0times as massive as the Sun. Around 1.5\u00a0billion years old, it has cooled and expanded since it was an A-type main-sequence star. Around 390 light-years distant, it shines with an apparent magnitude of 5.04. A planet around 11 times the mass of Jupiter was discovered in 2009 orbiting the star with a period of 516 days. HD 120084 is another evolved star, a yellow giant of spectral type G7III, around 2.4 times the mass of the Sun. It has a planet 4.5 times the mass of Jupiter, with one of the most eccentric planetary orbits (e = 0.66), discovered by precisely measuring the radial velocity of the star in 2013. HD 150706 is a sunlike star of spectral type G0V some 89 light-years distant from the Solar System. It was thought to have a planet as massive as Jupiter at a distance of 0.6 AU, but this was discounted in 2007. A further study published in 2012 showed that it has a companion around 2.7 times as massive as Jupiter that takes around 16 years to complete an orbit and is 6.8 AU distant from its star.\nDeep-sky objects.\nUrsa Minor is rather devoid of deep-sky objects. The Ursa Minor Dwarf, a dwarf spheroidal galaxy, was discovered by Albert George Wilson of the Lowell Observatory in the Palomar Sky Survey in 1955. Its centre is around light-years distant from Earth. In 1999, Kenneth Mighell and Christopher Burke used the Hubble Space Telescope to confirm that the galaxy had had a single burst of star formation that took place around 14\u00a0billion years ago and lasted around 2\u00a0billion years, and that the galaxy was probably as old as the Milky Way itself.\nNGC 3172 (also known as Polarissima Borealis) is a faint, magnitude-14.9 galaxy that happens to be the closest NGC object to the north celestial pole. It was discovered by John Herschel in 1831.\nNGC 6217 is a barred spiral galaxy located some 67 million light-years away, which can be located with a or larger telescope as an 11th-magnitude object about 2.5\u00b0 east-northeast of Zeta Ursae Minoris. It has been characterized as a starburst galaxy, which means it is undergoing a high rate of star formation compared with a typical galaxy.\nNGC 6251 is an active supergiant elliptical radio galaxy more than 340 million light-years away from Earth. It has a Seyfert 2 active galactic nucleus, and is one of the most extreme examples of a Seyfert galaxy. This galaxy may be associated with gamma-ray source 3EG J1621+8203, which has high-energy gamma-ray emission. It is also noted for its one-sided radio jet\u2014one of the brightest known\u2014discovered in 1977.\nMeteor showers.\nThe Ursids, a prominent meteor shower that occurs in Ursa Minor, peaks between December 18 and 25. Its parent body is the comet 8P/Tuttle.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Ultimate was developed in 1968 by Joel Silver, Buzzy Hellring, and Jonny Hines in Maplewood, New Jersey. Although ultimate resembles many traditional sports in its athletic requirements, it is unlike most sports due to its focus on self-officiating, even at the highest levels of competition. The term \"frisbee\" is a registered trademark of the Wham-O toy company, and thus the sport is not formally called \"ultimate frisbee\", though this name is still in common casual use (and the trademark was licensed to the Ultimate Frisbee Association in 2024). Points are scored by passing the disc to a teammate in the opposing end zone. Other basic rules are that players must not take steps while holding the disc, while interceptions, incomplete passes, and passes out of bounds are turnovers (change in possession). Rain, wind, or occasionally other adversities can make for a testing match with rapid turnovers, heightening the pressure of play.\nFrom its beginnings in the American counterculture of the late 1960s, ultimate has resisted empowering any referee with rule enforcement. Instead, it relies on the sportsmanship of players and invokes the \"spirit of the game\" to maintain fair play. Players call their own fouls, and dispute a foul only when they genuinely believe it did not occur. Playing without referees is the norm for league play but has been supplanted in club competition by the use of \"observers\" or \"game advisors\" to help in disputes, and the professional league employs empowered referees.\nIn 2012, there were 5.1 million ultimate players in the United States. Ultimate is played across the world in pickup games and by recreational, school, club, professional, and national teams at various age levels and with open, women's, and mixed divisions.\nThe USA has historically won most of the world titles, though not all. American teams won all three divisions (women's, men's, and mixed gender) at the world championship in 2024, and won the World Games in 2022. Other historically strong nations include Canada, Japan, Australia, and many European countries.\nInvention and history.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I just remember one time running for a pass and leaping up in the air and just feeling the Frisbee making it into my hand and feeling the perfect synchrony and the joy of the moment, and as I landed I said to myself, 'This is the ultimate game. This is the ultimate game.'\u2014\u200a\nTeam flying disc games using pie tins and cake pan lids were part of Amherst College student culture for decades before plastic discs were available. As of 2023, the college currently boasts a woman's team called Sparkle Motion (inspired by the dance team in Donnie Darko) and an open team titled Army of Darkness. A similar two-hand, touch-football-based game was played at Kenyon College in Ohio starting in 1942.\nFrom 1965 or 1966 Jared Kass and fellow Amherst students Bob Fein, Richard Jacobson, Robert Marblestone, Steve Ward, Fred Hoxie, Gordon Murray, and others evolved a team frisbee game based on concepts from American football, basketball, and soccer. This game had some of the basics of modern ultimate, including scoring by passing over a goal line, advancing the disc by passing, no travelling with the disc, and turnovers on interceptions or incomplete passes. Kass, an instructor and dorm advisor, taught this game to high school student Joel Silver during the summer of 1967 or 1968 at Northfield Mount Hermon School summer camp.\nJoel Silver, along with fellow students Jonny Hines, Buzzy Hellring, and others, further developed ultimate beginning in 1968 at Columbia High School, Maplewood, New Jersey, US (CHS). The first sanctioned game was played at CHS in 1968 between the student council and the student newspaper staff. Beginning the following year, evening games were played in the glow of mercury-vapor lights on the school's student-designated parking lot. Initially players of ultimate Frisbee (as it was known at the time) used a \"Master\" disc marketed by Wham-O, based on Fred Morrison's inspired \"Pluto Platter\" design. Hellring, Silver, and Hines developed the first and second edition of \"Rules of Ultimate Frisbee\". In 1970 CHS defeated Millburn High 43\u201310 in the first interscholastic ultimate game, which was played in the evening in the CHS's faculty parking lot. Millburn, and three other New Jersey high schools made up the first conference of ultimate teams beginning in 1971.\nAlumni of that first league took the game to their colleges and universities. Rutgers defeated Princeton 29\u201327 in 1972 in the first intercollegiate game. This game was played exactly 103 years after the first intercollegiate American football game by the same teams at precisely the same site, which had been paved as a parking lot in the interim. Rutgers won both games by an identical margin.\nRutgers also won the first ultimate Frisbee tournament in 1975, hosted by Yale, with 8 college teams participating. That summer ultimate was introduced at the Second World Frisbee Championships at the Rose Bowl. This event introduced ultimate on the west coast of the US.\nIn 1975, ultimate was introduced at the Canadian Open Frisbee Championships in Toronto as a showcase event. Ultimate league play in Canada began in Toronto in 1979. The Toronto Ultimate Club is one of ultimate's oldest leagues.\nIn January 1977 Wham-O introduced the World Class \"80 Mold\" 165 gram frisbee. This disc quickly replaced the relatively light and flimsy Master frisbee with much improved stability and consistency of throws even in windy conditions. Throws like the flick and hammer were possible with greater control and accuracy with this sturdier disc. The 80 Mold was used in ultimate tournaments even after it was discontinued in 1983.\nDiscraft, founded in the late 1970s by Jim Kenner in London, Ontario, later moved the company from Canada to its present location in Wixom, Michigan. Discraft introduced the Ultrastar 175 gram disc in 1981, with an updated mold in 1983. This disc was adopted as the standard for ultimate during the 1980s, with Wham-O holdouts frustrated by the discontinuation of the 80 mold and plastic quality problems with discs made on the replacement 80e mold. Wham-O soon introduced a contending 175 gram disc, the U-Max, that also suffered from quality problems and was never widely popular for ultimate. In 1991 the Ultrastar was specified as the official disc for UPA tournament play and remains in wide use.\nThe popularity of the sport spread quickly, taking hold as a free-spirited alternative to traditional organized sports. In recent years college ultimate has attracted a greater number of traditional athletes, raising the level of competition and athleticism and providing a challenge to its laid back, free-spirited roots. In the 1990s, ultimate became a popular sport on university campuses around the world, leading to the establishment of a national sport federations.\nIn 2010, Anne Watson, a Vermont teacher and ultimate coach, launched a seven-year effort to have ultimate recognized as full varsity sport in the state's high schools. Watson's effort culminated on November 3, 2017, when the Vermont Principals Association, which oversees the state's high school sports programs, unanimously approved ultimate as a varsity sport beginning in the Spring 2019 season. The approval made Vermont the first U.S. state to recognize ultimate as a varsity sport.\nIn 2019, Oklahoma Christian University launched the first American varsity ultimate program and full ride ultimate scholarships competing in Division 3 Men's. They would go on to win National Championships in 2021 and 2022. Davenport University aims to follow suit adding Men's and Women's teams beginning in the 2023\u201324 academic year.\nPlayers associations.\nIn late December 1979, the first national player-run ultimate organization was founded in the United States as the Ultimate Players Association (UPA). Tom Kennedy was elected its first director. Before the UPA, events had been sponsored by the International Frisbee Association (IFA), a promotional arm of Wham-O.\nThe UPA organized regional tournaments and has crowned a national champion every year since 1979. Glassboro State College defeated the Santa Barbara Condors 19\u201318 at the first UPA Nationals in 1979.\nIn 2010, the UPA rebranded itself as USA Ultimate.\nThe first European Championship tournament for national teams was held in 1980 in Paris. Finland won, with England and Sweden finishing second and third. In 1981, the European Flying Disc Federation (EFDF) was formed. In 1984, the World Flying Disc Federation (WFDF) was formed by the EFDF to be the international governing body for disc sports. The first World Championships tournament was held in 1983 in Gothenburg, Sweden.\nThe European Ultimate Federation is the governing body for the sport of ultimate in Europe. Founded in 2009, it is part of the European Flying Disc Federation (EFDF) and of the World Flying Disc Federation.\nUltimate Canada, the national governing body in Canada, was formed in 1993. The first Canadian National Ultimate Championships were held in Ottawa in 1987.\nIn 2006, ultimate became a BUCS accredited sport at Australian and UK universities for both indoor and outdoor open division events.\nThe WFDF was granted full IOC recognition on 2 Aug 2015. This allows the possibility for the organization to receive IOC funding and become an Olympic Game.\nRules.\nA point is scored when one team catches the disc in the opposing team's end zone.\nEach point begins with both teams lining up on the front of their respective end zone line. Standing beyond the end zone line before the disc is thrown by the defense (a \"pull\") to the offense is known as an \"offsides\" violation. A regulation grass outdoor game has seven players per team. In mixed ultimate, the teams usually play with a \"4-3\" ratio, meaning either 4 men and 3 women or 4 women and 3 men will be playing. The offensive end zone dictates whether there are more men or women. This end zone is called the 'gen-zone', short for gender zone.\nEach point begins with the two teams starting in opposite end zones. The team who scored the previous point are now on defense. The teams indicate their readiness by raising a hand, and the team on defense will throw the disc to the other team. This throw is called a \"pull\". When the pull is released, all players are free to leave their end zones and occupy any area on the field. Both teams should not leave the end-zone before the pull is released. Thus, the defending team must run most of the field length at speed to defend immediately, and a good pull is designed to hang in the air as long as possible to give the defending team time to make the run.\nTo score goals, the players of each team try to get the possession of the flying disc (without making physical contact with players), pass it from one teammate to the other, and keep it away from the opponents till it is carried all the way towards their (opponents\u2019) end zone or goal area. Each end-zone lies at each end of the court.\nThe player holding the disc must establish a pivot point (i.e. they cannot run with the disc, just step out from a single point). They must establish a pivot at \"the appropriate spot\" on the field (where they caught the disc, or as soon as possible after slowing down). The player can also catch and throw the disc within three steps without establishing a pivot. A violation of these rules is called a \"travel\". The disc is advanced by throwing it to teammates. If a pass is incomplete, it is a \"turnover\" and the opposing team immediately gains possession, playing to score in the opposite direction. Passes are incomplete if they are caught by a defender, touch the ground (meaning defenders need only knock the disc out of the air to gain possession), or touch an out-of-bounds object before being caught. The first body part to touch the ground is the one considered for bounds, which means a player may catch the disc and 'toe the line', or put a foot down, before falling out of bounds. However, if a player jumps from in bounds, catches, and then throws the disc while in the air and technically out of bounds, the disc is still in play and can be caught or defended by players on the field. This feat of athleticism and precision is highly praised, and dubbed \"Greatest.\" Once possession of the disc is obtained, however, it cannot be forced out of the throwers possession before it leaves their hand. A common infraction of this nature is called a \"strip\", in which one player feels that they had enough possession of the disc to stop its rotation before it was taken out of their hand.\nUltimate is non-contact. Non-incidental, play-affecting, or dangerous physical contact is not allowed. Non-incidental contact is a foul, regardless of intent, with various consequences depending on the situation and the league rules. Incidental contact, like minor collisions while jumping for the disc or running for it, can be acceptable, depending on the circumstances. Parameters like who has the \"right\" to the relevant space, who caught the disc etc. will determine whether a foul has been committed or not. Attitudes can vary between leagues and countries, even if the letter of the rule remains the same.\nContact is disallowed for both defence and offence, including the defender marking the offensive player with the disc, and there are further restrictions on positions this defender can take in order to minimize incidental contact.\nDefending against the person who has the disc is a central part of the defensive strategy (colloquially \"marking\"). The defensive \"marker\" counts aloud to 10 seconds, which is referred to as \"stalling\". If the disc has not been thrown when the defending player reaches 10, it is turned over to the other team. \"Stall\" can only be called after the defender has actually counted the 10 seconds. In order for the \"mark\" to be considered as counting all the way to ten, the thrower must throw the disc before the mark is able to say the \"T\" in the word ten. If the mark is accused of counting too fast (called a \"fast-count\"), then the thrower can call a violation, in which the mark then has to subtract two seconds from their previous stall count and slow their counting. There can only be one player defending in a radius around the person who has the disc unless that player is defending against another offensive player. The marker must stay one disc's diameter away from the thrower and must not wrap their hands around the thrower, or the person with the disc can call a foul (\"wrapping\").\nIn ultimate, there is no concept of intentional vs. unintentional fouls: infractions are called by the players themselves and resolved in such a way as to minimize the impact of such calls on the outcome of the play (sometimes resulting in \"do-overs\" where the disc is returned to the last uncontested possession), rather than emphasizing penalties or \"win-at-all-costs\" behavior. If a player disagrees with a foul that was called on them, they can choose to \"contest\" the infraction. In many instances, a conversation ensues between both parties involved in the foul, and a verdict is determined as to whether the disc will be returned and a \"do-over\" will commence, or if the person guilty of the foul has no objections to the call. A common infraction, intentional or not, is a \"pick\" where the offense (or your own team member even) is somehow in the way of your pursuit of your \"check\" in man-to-man defense. This only applies when you started within 10 feet of your \"check\" and the game play is stopped so that the players involved go back to where the \"pick\" occurred. The integrity of ultimate depends on each player's responsibility to uphold the spirit of the game.\nUltimate is predominantly self-refereed, relying on the on-field players to call their own infractions and to try their best to play within the rules of the game. It is assumed that players will not intentionally violate the rules and will be honest when discussing foul calls with opponents. This is called Spirit of the Game, or simply Spirit. After a call is made, the players should agree on an outcome, based on what they think happened and how the rules apply to that situation. If players cannot come to agreement on the call's validity, the disc can be given back to the last uncontested thrower, with play restarting as if before the disputed throw. Coaches and other players on the sidelines cannot make calls, however they may inform players of specific rules in the case of a contested call. Players on the sideline may also be asked for their view, as they often have \"best perspective\" to see what happened.\nA regulation outdoor game is played 7\u00a0vs.\u00a07, with substitutions allowed between points and for injuries. Games are typically played to a points limit of 13/15/17 or more, or a time limit of 75/90/100 minutes. There is usually a halftime break and an allowance of two timeouts per team each half.\nA regulation field is by , including end zones each deep.\nCompetitive ultimate is played in gender divisions using gender determination rules based on those of the IOC. Different competitions may have a \"men's\" or an \"open\" division (the latter usually being extremely male-dominated at competitive levels, but technically unrestricted). Mixed is officially played with 4 of one gender and 3 of the other, but variants exist for different numbers. Men's, women's, and mixed ultimate are played by the same rules besides those explicitly dealing with gender restrictions.\nRulebooks: USAU, WFDF, UFA.\nSome rules vary between North America and the rest of the world.\nMore significant rule changes were made in the Ultimate Frisbee Association pro league games.\nMost differences are minor and they can be found online. USAU rules have been slowly shifting toward WFDF compatibility.\nUFA rule changes.\nThe Ultimate Frisbee Association (UFA), the semi-professional ultimate league with teams in the U.S. and Canada, has its own variant of the rules, and has made multiple rule changes in recent years. Some of the more important include:\nThrowing and catching techniques.\nA catch can grab the rim with one or two hands, or simultaneously grab the top and bottom of the frisbee \u2013 in a clap-catch / \"pancake catch\". Care is needed with the hand placement when catching with one hand on the disc rim, making sure to catch on the proper side of the disc, according to which way the disc is spinning. When a frisbee is thrown at high speeds, as is frequently the case in a competitive game of ultimate, one side of the disc can spin out of the player's hand, and the other side can spin into their hand, which can make a catch far more secure. For this reason, along with the desire to secure the frisbee strongly and \"cleanly\", the general advice is to strongly prefer to catch with two hands if possible.\nThe most popular throws are backhand and forehand/flick. Less frequently used throws include the hammer, scoober, thumber, push-passes, chicken wing, biscuit, and throwing with the non-dominant hand. Part of the area of ultimate where skill and strategy meet is a player's capacity to plot and execute on throwing and passing to outrun another team, which is colloquially known as \"being a deep threat\". For example, multiple throwing techniques and the ability to pass the disc before the defense has had a chance to reset helps increase a player or team's threat level, and merging that with speed and coordinated plays can form a phalanx that is hard for competitors to overcome.\nWhen referencing the curve of a throw, the terms outside-in (OI) and inside-out (IO) are used. An OI throw is one that curves in towards the opposite side of the throwers body from which it is thrown. An IO throw is one that curves toward the same side of the throwers body from which it is thrown. With the rotation of the disc in mind, an IO throw has the side of the disc rotating toward the direction of the throw angled to the ground, whereas an OI throw has the side of the disc rotating toward the thrower angled to the ground. IO throws are generally the more difficult throw, and are very useful for breaking the mark.\nStrategy and tactics.\nOffense.\nTeams can employ many different offensive strategies, each with distinct goals. Most basic strategies are an attempt to create open space (e.g. lanes) on the field in which the thrower and receiver can complete a pass. Organized teams assign positions to the players based on their specific strengths. Designated throwers are called handlers and designated receivers are called cutters. The amount of autonomy or overlap between these positions depends on the make-up of the team.\nMany advanced teams develop variations on the basic offenses to take advantage of the strengths of specific players. Frequently, these offenses are meant to isolate a few key players in one-on-one situations, allowing them to take advantage of mismatches, while the others play a supporting role.\nHandlers and cutters.\nIn most settings, there are a few \"handlers\" which are the players positioned around the disc. Their task is to distribute the disc forward and provide easy receiving options to whoever has the disc. Cutters, are the players positioned downfield, whose job is usually to catch the disc farther afield and progress the disc through the field or score goals by catching the disc in the end zone.\nTypically, when the offense is playing against a zone defense the cutters will be assigned positions based on their location on the field, oftentimes referred to as \"poppers and rails (or deep deeps).\" Poppers will typically make cuts within 15 yards of the handler positions while rails alternate between longer movements downfield. Additionally, against a zone there are typically three or four instead of the usual two or three, depending on the team.\nVertical stack.\nOne of the most common offensive strategies is the vertical stack. In this strategy, a number of offensive players line up between the disc and the end zone they are attacking. From this position, players in the stack make cuts (sudden sprints, usually after throwing off the defender by a \"fake\" move the other way) into the space available, attempting to get open and receive the disc. The stack generally lines up in the middle of the field, thereby opening up two lanes along the sidelines for cuts, although a captain may occasionally call for the stack to line up closer to one sideline, leaving open just one larger cutting lane on the other side. Variations of the vertical stack include the Side Stack, where the stack is moved to a sideline and one player is isolated in the open space, and the Split Stack, where players are split between two stacks, one on either sideline. The Side Stack is most helpful in an end zone play where your players line up on one side of the end zone and the handler calls an \"ISO\" (isolation) using one of the player's names. This then signals for the rest of the players on your team to clear away from that one person in order for them to receive a pass. Another variation is called Cascades, which starts by setting a side stack. Then, the player at the top or bottom of the stack cuts, using the large amount of available space. Once the initial cutter has finished (whether they caught the disc or if they were waved away by the handler), then the next cutter in line continues. In vertical stack offenses, one player usually plays the role of 'dump', offering a reset option which sets up behind the player with the disc.\nHorizontal stack.\nAnother popular offensive strategy is the horizontal stack, also called \u201cho-stack\u201d. In the most popular form of this offense, three \"handlers\" line up across the width of the field with four \"cutters\" downfield, spaced evenly across the field. This formation encourages cutters to attack any of the space either towards or away from the disc, granting each cutter access to the full width of the field and thereby allowing a degree more creativity than is possible with a vertical stack. If cutters cannot get open, the handlers swing the disc side to side to reset the stall count and in an attempt to get the defense out of position. Usually players will cut towards the disc at an angle and away from the disc straight, creating a 'diamond' or 'peppermill' pattern.\nFeature, German, or isolation.\nA variation on the horizontal stack offense is called a feature, German, or isolation (or \"iso\" for short). In this offensive strategy three of the cutters line up deeper than usual (this can vary from 5 yards farther downfield to at the endzone) while the remaining cutter lines up closer to the handlers. This closest cutter is known as the \"feature\", or \"German\". The idea behind this strategy is that it opens up space for the feature to cut, and at the same time it allows handlers to focus all of their attention on only one cutter. This maximizes the ability for give-and-go strategies between the feature and the handlers. It is also an excellent strategy if one cutter is superior to other cutters, or if they are guarded by someone slower than them. While the main focus is on the handlers and the feature, the remaining three cutters can be used if the feature cannot get open, if there is an open deep look, or for a continuation throw from the feature itself. Typically, however, these three remaining cutters do all they can to get out of the feature's way.\nIt is usually used near the endzone.\nHexagon or Mexican.\nA newer strategy, credited to Felix Shardlow from the Brighton Ultimate team, is called Hexagon Offence. Players spread out in equilateral triangles, creating a hexagon shape with one player (usually not the thrower) in the middle. They create space for each other dynamically, aiming to keep the disc moving by taking the open pass in any direction. This changes the angles of attack rapidly, and hopes to create and exploit holes in the defense. Hex aims to generate and maintain flow to lead to scoring opportunities.\nDefense.\nPull.\nThe pull is the first throw of the game and also begins each period of play. A good, accurate pull is an important part of a defensive strategy. The optimal pull has two features: 1) To start the offense as deep into their own end-zone as possible, giving the offense more distance to cover. 2) To stay in the air as long as possible, giving the defense more time to get set up before the first offensive pass.\nA pull is not limited to any certain throw. However, most players use the inside out backhand throw to achieve maximum hang time and distance.\nThere is no pivot required for a pull. The offensive team must have at least one foot on the goal line and must not change their position until the disc has left the thrower's hand. The defensive team must stay behind the goal line until the disc is released, or it is considered 'offside'. The defensive team is not allowed to touch the disc until it has been touched by the opposing team or has touched the ground. A pull that is touched midair by the offense, but is not caught, results in a turnover.\nForce.\nOne of the most basic defensive principles is the \"force\" or \"mark\". The defender marking the thrower essentially tries to force them to throw in a particular direction (to the \"force side\" or \"open side\"), whilst making it difficult for them to throw in the opposite direction (the \"break side\"). Downfield defenders make it hard for the receiving players to get free on the open/force side, knowing throws to the break side are less likely to be accurate. The space is divided in this way because it is very hard for the player marking the disc to stop every throw, and very hard for the downfield defenders to cover every space.\nThe force is usually decided by the defence before the point, but it can be communicated during play. The most common force is a one-way force, either towards the \"home\" side (where the team has their bags/kit), or \"away\". Other forces are \"sideline\" (force towards the closest sideline), \"middle\" (force towards the center of the field), \"straight up\" (the force stands directly in front of the thrower \u2013 useful against long throwers), or \"sidearm/backhand\" if one wishes their opponents to throw a particular throw. Another, more advanced marking technique is called the \"triangle mark\". This involves shuffling and drop stepping to take away throwing angles in an order that usually goes: 1) take away shown throw \"inside\" 2) shuffle to take away 1st pivot \"around\" 3) drop step and shuffle to take away 2nd pivot 4) recover. However, this marking technique is typically used to block long throws as well as force a certain side.\nMatch-to-match.\nThe simplest defensive strategy is the match-to-match defense (also known as \"one-to-one\", \"person-to-person\", \"man-on-man\", or \"man defense\"), where each defender guards a specific offensive player, called their \"mark\". This defense creates one-to-one matchups all over the field \u2013 if each defender shuts out their mark, the team will likely earn a turn over. The defensive players will usually choose their mark at the beginning of the point before the pull. Often players will mark the same person throughout the game, giving them an opportunity to pick up on their opponent's strengths and weaknesses as they play.\nPoaching.\nPoaching is a term used to describe one or more players temporarily leaving their match up to strategically cover space in an otherwise person-to-person defensive scheme. Typical areas covered might be deep space (to defend long throws aimed at scoring quickly), near handlers (to narrow throwing lanes, making throws more difficult), or leaving players who are less likely to get the disc to help cover other areas of the field that are more likely to be directly attacked (such as moving closer to the disc when the disc is trapped on one side of the field).\nA common occurrence of poaching is when a player is accidentally open in a dangerous position. In this situation, it is common for another player to temporarily cover him defensively to avoid a fast score. This is common when the deepest person of the defense sees someone running past him, without a defender catching up to him, and it might be considered obligatory to run and cover the player open deep.\nPlayers may also leave their match to cover throwing lanes, particularly if they are marking a reset or alternative handler.\nZone.\nWith a zone defensive strategy, the defenders cover an area rather than a specific person. The area they cover varies depending on the particular zone they are playing, and the position of the disc. Zone defense is frequently used in poor weather conditions, as it can pressure the offense into completing more passes, or the thrower into making bigger or harder throws. Zone defence is also effective at neutralising the deep throw threat from the offense. A zone defense usually has two components \u2013 (1) a number of players who stay close to the disc and attempt to contain the offenses' ability to pass and move forward (a \"cup\" or \"wall\"), and (2) a number of players spaced out further from the disc, ready to bid on overhead or longer throws.\nCup.\nA variation of a zone defence, the cup is effectively a three person mark. The cup involves three players, arranged in a semi-circular cup-shaped formation, one in the middle and back, the other two on the sides and forward. One of the side players marks the handler with a force, while the other two guard the open side. Therefore, the handler will normally have to throw into the cup, allowing the defenders to more easily make blocks. With a cup, usually the center cup blocks the up-field lane to cutters, while the side cup blocks the cross-field swing pass to other handlers. The center cup usually also has the responsibility to call out which of the two sides should mark the thrower, usually the defender closest to the sideline of the field. The idea of the cup is to force the offense to attempt risky throws through and around the cup that have low rates of completion. The cup (except the marker) must also remember to stay 3 meters or more away from the offensive player with the disc. The only time a player in the cups can come within 3 meters of the player with the disc is when another offensive player comes within 3 meters of the person with the disc, also known as \"crashing the cup\". When the second offensive player moves further than 3 meters away, the members of the cup (except the marker) must go back to being 3 meters or more away from the player with the disc.\nWall.\nThe \"wall\" sometimes referred to as the \"1-3-3\" involves four players in the close defense. One player is the marker, also called the \"rabbit\", \"chaser\" or \"puke\" because they often have to run quickly between multiple handlers spread out across the field. The other three defenders form a horizontal \"wall\" or line across the field in front of the handler to stop throws to short in-cuts and prevent forward progress. The players in the second group of this zone defense, called \"mids\" and \"deeps\", position themselves further out to stop throws that escape the first line of defence and fly upfield. A variation of the 1-3-3 is to have two markers: The \"rabbit\" marks in the middle third and strike side third of the field. The goal is for the \"rabbit\" to trap the thrower and collapse a cup around her or him. If the rabbit is broken for large horizontal yardage, or if the disc reaches the break side third of the field, the break side defender of the front wall marks the throw. In this variation the force is directed one way. This variation plays to the strength of a superior marking \"rabbit\".\nJunk and clam.\nA junk defense is a defense using elements of both zone and match defenses; the most well-known is the \"clam\" or \"chrome wall\". In clam defenses, defenders cover cutting lanes rather than zones of the field or individual players. It is so named because, when played against a vertical stack, it is often disguised by lining up in a traditional person defense and right before play starts, defenders spread out to their zonal positions, forming the shape of an opening clam. The clam can be used by several players on a team while the rest are running a match defense. Typically, a few defenders play match on the throwers while the cutter defenders play as \"flats\", taking away in cuts by guarding their respective areas, or as the \"deep\" or \"monster\", taking away any deep throws.\nThis defensive strategy is often referred to as \"bait and switch\". In this case, when the two players the defenders are covering are standing close to each other in the stack, one defender will move over to cover them deep, and the other will move slightly more towards the thrower. When one of the receivers makes a deep cut, the first defender picks them up, and if one makes an in-cut, the second defender covers them. The defenders communicate and switch their marks if their respective charges change their cuts from in to deep, or vice versa. The clam can also be used by the entire team, with different defenders covering in cuts, deep cuts, break side cuts, and dump cuts.\nThe term \"junk defense\" is also often used to refer to zone defenses in general (or to zone defense applied by the defending team momentarily, before switching to a match defense), especially by members of the attacking team before they have determined which exact type of zone defense they are facing.\nBracket.\nBracket defenses are almost exclusively used on vertical stack offences, and incorporate elements of both zone and match defence. In bracket defense, the handlers are covered by match defence, and the only changes are when marking the cutters. Once the stack has set up, one player (the \"deep\" or \"monster\") will set up a defence on the back of the stack. Simultaneously, a defensive player (known as the \"under\") will set up between the front of the stack and the handler with the disc. The rest of the defence will set up a match defence on the players in the stack. When play begins, any cutters who try to go for a long throw will be covered by the \"deep\", and any cutters who try to go towards the handler will be covered by the \"under\". This defence attempts to force the offence into 1-on-1 situations with the strongest defensive players.\nHasami.\nHasami, the Japanese word for \"scissors\", is a popular hybrid person/zone defence used by the Japanese women's team who won gold at WUGC 2012. The name refers to the method of using two pairs of defenders to cut the area downfield into sections, with defenders responsible for space \"under\" (nearer the disc) and \"away\" (towards the end zone), and also the left and right areas of the field. Defenders rely on visual and verbal communication to switch and cover the offensive threats between them. Hasami forms the basis of most Japanese style zone defences.\nHexagon or flexagon.\nA combinatory type of defense is hexagon or \"flexagon\", which incorporates elements of both match-to-match and zonal defense. All defenders are encouraged to communicate, to sandwich their opponents and switch marks wherever appropriate, and to ensure no opposing player is left unmarked.\nSpirit of the game.\nAll youth and most club ultimate games are self-officiated through the \"spirit of the game\", often abbreviated SOTG. Spirit of the game is described by WFDF as an expectation that each player will be a good sport and play fair, as well as having high values of integrity; including \"following and enforcing the rules\". Another example is the practice of the players \"taking a knee,\" i.e., kneeling on one knee, during the timeout when a player suffers an injury; as a sign of respect to the injured. SOTG is further contextualized and described in the rules established by USA Ultimate; according to \"The Official Rules of Ultimate\", 11th Edition:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Ultimate has traditionally relied upon a spirit of sportsmanship which places the responsibility for fair play on the player. Highly competitive play is encouraged, but never at the expense of the bond of mutual respect between players, adherence to the agreed upon rules of the game, or the basic joy of play. Protection of these vital elements serves to eliminate adverse conduct from the ultimate field. Such actions as taunting of opposing players, dangerous aggression, intentional fouling, or other 'win-at-all-costs' behavior are contrary to the spirit of the game and must be avoided by all players.\nMany tournaments give awards for the most spirited teams and/or players, often based on ratings provided by opposing teams. The largest youth ultimate tournament in the world, Spring Reign, uses spirit scores to award a spirit prize within each pool and to determine eligibility of teams the following year. In many non-professional games, it is common for teams to meet after the game in a \"spirit circle\" to discuss the game, and in some cases, grant individual spirit awards.\nWhile \"spirit of the game\" is a general attitude, ultimate has an agreed-upon procedure to deal with unclear or disputed situations.\nIn Europe and other continents, even top-level play does not have referees. Most world championship games have had no referees, and disputes were decided by the players themselves.\nObservers are used in some high-level tournaments outside the US, as well as in some tournaments sanctioned by USA Ultimate. Most calls and disputes are initially handled by the players, but observers may offer to step in if no agreement is reached. A few calls, such as out-of-bounds, are considered \"active calls\", and are treated like referee calls in other sports.\nOther forms of refereeing exist in ultimate. Professional ultimate in North America uses referees, in part to increase the pace of the game. In some international competitions, game advisors are used who may provide rules clarification or their perspective on plays, though calls and final decisions remain in control of the on-field players.\nCompetitions.\nThe common types of competitions are:\nProfessional Leagues (UFA, PUL, and WUL in North America).\nNorth America consists of one men's professional-level ultimate league, the Ultimate Frisbee Association (UFA) (formerly known as the American Ultimate Disc League (AUDL)), with teams from the United States and Canada. The United States has two women's professional leagues, the Premier Ultimate League (PUL) and the Western Ultimate League (WUL).\nThe AUDL was founded by Josh Moore and its inaugural season began in April 2012. In 2013 the league was bought by Ultimate Xperience Ventures LLC, a company founded by Rob Lloyd who was serving as VP of Cisco but has since become the CEO of Hyperloop. In 2012 the league began with eight teams, but currently consists of 22 teams in four divisions (East, South, Midwest, and West). Since the league's inaugural season, they have added 24 new teams and had 10 teams fold. Only two of the original eight teams remain in the league (Detroit Mechanix and Indianapolis AlleyCats). Each team plays a total of 14 regular season games on Friday, Saturday, or Sunday during the months of April through July. In late July there are playoffs in each division followed by a championship weekend held the first weekend in August. The AUDL uses the Discraft Ultrastar as the official game disc. The team funding comes from sources similar to those of other professional sports: sales of tickets, merchandise, concessions and sponsorship. In 2014, the league entered an agreement with ESPN to broadcast 18 games per season for a two-year period (with a third year option) on the online streaming service ESPN3. That contract was executed by Fulcrum Media Group.\nThere used to be a rival league named Major League Ultimate (MLU). Active between 2013 and 2016, it had eight teams, and was considered the main alternative to the AUDL, until it closed down. It used the Innova Pulsar as the official game disc.\nIn 2018, there was a planned mixed league called the United Ultimate League (UUL), but it did not come to fruition due to a lack of funding. The plan was to present an alternative to the AUDL, which at the time was dealing with a boycott related to gender equality. The UUL was supposed to be supported by crowd sourced funding, but the initial Kickstarter failed, raising only $23,517 of the $50,000 goal.\nThe Premier Ultimate League (PUL) was established in 2019. The league includes women and nonbinary players and hosts teams from the United States and until 2023, Colombia. The PUL is a 501(c)6 nonprofit that is operated by a board of directors that includes representatives from each of the participating teams. The mission of PUL is \"to achieve equity in the sport of ultimate by increasing accessibility to and visibility of women* players through high-quality competition, leadership experiences, and community partnerships. Our league strives for gender, racial, and economic diversity in the sport of ultimate frisbee.\"\nThe Western Ultimate League (WUL) was established a year after the PUL in 2020. After successfully running a series of professional showcase games in collaboration with the AUDL in 2019, a group of team organizers in the western United States set their sites on joining the PUL in its second season. This coalition grew to include seven teams across the west and was ultimately too big of an expansion for the PUL as a second year league. The Western Ultimate League was established instead by the combined member teams: Seattle Tempest, Portland Swifts, Utah Wild, San Francisco Falcons, Los Angeles Astra, San Diego Super Bloom, and Arizona Sidewinders. The WUL works in collaboration with the PUL and has their sites set on a future merger. The first season of the WUL was cancelled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its inaugural season wasn't held until 2022. The Portland Swifts withdrew in 2020 and later the Oregon Onyx joined the league in 2022. The 2022 champions were the Seattle Tempest. A new team, Colorado Alpenglow, was added in October 2022 for the 2023 season, bringing the league up to 8 teams.\nNorth American leagues.\nRegulation play, sanctioned in the United States by the USA Ultimate, occurs at the college (open and women's divisions), club (open, women's, mixed [male + female on each team], masters, and grandmasters divisions) and youth levels (in boys and girls divisions), with annual championships in all divisions. Top teams from the championship series compete in semi-annual world championships regulated by the WFDF (alternating between Club Championships and National Championships), made up of national flying disc organizations and federations from about 50 countries.\nUltimate Canada (UC) is the governing body for the sport of ultimate in Canada. Beginning in 1993, the goals of UC include representing the interests of the sport and all ultimate players, as well as promoting its growth and development throughout Canada. UC also facilitates open and continuous communication within the ultimate community and within the sports community and to organize ongoing activities for the sport including national competitions and educational programs.\nFounded in 1986, incorporated in 1993, the Ottawa-Carleton Ultimate Association based in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, claims to have the largest summer league in the world with 354 teams and over 5000 players as of 2004.\nThe Vancouver Ultimate League, based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, formed in 1986, claims to have 5300 active members as of 2017.\nThe Toronto Ultimate Club, founded in 1979 by Ken Westerfield and Chris Lowcock, based in Toronto, Canada, has 3300 members and 250 teams, playing the year round.\nThe Los Angeles Organization of Ultimate Teams puts on annual tournaments with thousands of players.\nThere have been a small number of children's leagues. The largest and first known pre-high school league was started in 1993 by Mary Lowry, Joe Bisignano, and Jeff Jorgenson in Seattle, Washington. In 2005, the DiscNW Middle School Spring League had over 450 players on 30 mixed teams. Large high school leagues are also becoming common. The largest one is the DiscNW High School Spring League. It has both mixed and single gender divisions with over 30 teams total. The largest adult league is the San Francisco Ultimate League, with 350 teams and over 4000 active members in 2005, located in San Francisco, California. The largest per capita is the Madison Ultimate Frisbee association, with an estimated 1.8% of the population of Madison, WI playing in active leagues. Dating back to 1977, the Mercer County (New Jersey) Ultimate Disc League is the world's oldest recreational league. There are even large leagues with children as young as third grade, an example being the junior division of the SULA ultimate league in Amherst, Massachusetts.\nMany other countries have their own regional and country wide competitions, which are not listed here.\nCollege teams.\nThere are over 12,000 student athletes playing on over 700 college ultimate teams in North America, and the number of teams is steadily growing.\nUltimate Canada operates one main competition for university ultimate teams in Canada: Canadian University Ultimate Championships (CUUC) with six qualifying regional events, one of which is the Canadian Eastern University Ultimate Championships (CEUUC).\nNational teams.\nThere are also national teams participating in international tournaments, in both field and beach formats.\nYearly or twice-yearly national competitions are held.\nIn the US and other countries, the national teams are selected after a tryout process.\nWFDF maintains an international ranking list for the national teams \nHat tournaments.\nHat tournaments are common in the ultimate circuit. At these tournaments players join individually rather than as a team. The tournament organizers form teams by randomly taking the names of the participants from a hat.\nMany hat tournaments on the US west coast have a \"hat rule\" requiring all players to wear a hat at all times during play. If a player gains possession of the disc, yet loses her or his hat in the process, the play is considered a turnover and possession of the disc reverts to the other team.\nHowever, in some tournaments, the organizers do not actually use a hat, but form teams while taking into account skill, experience, sex, age, height, and fitness level of the players in the attempt to form teams of even strength. Many times the random element remains, so that organizers randomly pick players from each level for each team, combining a lottery with skill matching. Usually, players provide this information when signing up to enter the tournament. There are also many cities that run hat leagues, structured like a hat tournament, but where the group of players stay together over the course of a season.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Founded in 1861, it is one of the oldest universities on the West Coast.\nThe university has a main campus in the city's University District, with satellite campuses in nearby cities of Tacoma and Bothell. Overall, UW encompasses more than 500 buildings and over 20 million gross square footage of space, including one of the largest library systems in the world with more than 26 university libraries, art centers, museums, laboratories, lecture halls, and stadiums.\nWashington is the flagship institution of the state's six public universities. Known for its medical, engineering, and scientific research, Washington is a member of the Association of American Universities. According to the National Science Foundation, UW spent $1.73 billion on research and development in 2024, ranking it fifth in the nation. Its 22 varsity sports teams compete as the Huskies in the Big Ten Conference of NCAA Division I, and represent the United States at the Olympic Games and other competitions.\nHistory.\nFounding.\nIn 1854, territorial governor Isaac Stevens recommended the establishment of a university in the Washington Territory. Prominent Seattle-area residents, including Methodist preacher Daniel Bagley, saw this as a chance to add to the city's potential and prestige. Bagley learned of a law that allowed United States territories to sell land to raise money in support of public schools. At the time, Arthur A. Denny, one of the founders of Seattle and a member of the territorial legislature, aimed to increase the city's importance by moving the territory's capital from Olympia to Seattle. However, Bagley ultimately persuaded Denny that founding a university would better contribute to the growth of Seattle's economy. Two universities were initially chartered, but later the decision was repealed in favor of a single university in Lewis County provided that locally donated land was available. When no site emerged, Denny successfully petitioned the legislature to reconsider Seattle as a location in 1858.\nIn 1861, scouting began for an appropriate site in Seattle to serve as a new university campus. Arthur and Mary Denny donated eight acres, while fellow pioneers Edward Lander, and Charlie and Mary Terry, donated two acres on Denny's Knoll in downtown Seattle. More specifically, this tract was bounded by 4th Avenue to the west, 6th Avenue to the east, Union Street to the north, and Seneca Streets to the south.\nJohn Pike, for whom Pike Street is named, was the university's architect and builder. It was opened on November 4, 1861, as the Territorial University of Washington. The legislature passed articles incorporating the university, and establishing its Board of Regents in 1862. The school initially struggled, closing three times: in 1863 for low enrollment, and again in 1867 and 1876 for shortage of funds. Washington awarded its first graduate Clara Antoinette McCarty Wilt in 1876, with a Bachelor of Science degree.\n19th-century relocation.\nBy the time Washington state entered the Union in 1889, both Seattle and the university had grown substantially. Washington's total undergraduate enrollment increased from 30 to nearly 300 students, and the campus's relative isolation in downtown Seattle faced encroaching development. A special legislative committee, headed by UW graduate Edmond Meany, was created to find a new campus to better serve the growing student population and faculty. The committee eventually selected a site on the northeast of downtown Seattle called Union Bay, which was the land of the Duwamish, and the legislature appropriated funds for its purchase and construction. In 1895, the university relocated to the new campus by moving into the newly built Denny Hall. The University Regents tried and failed to sell the old campus, eventually settling with leasing the area. This later became one of the university's most valuable pieces of real estate in modern-day Seattle, generating millions in annual revenue with what is now called the Metropolitan Tract. The original Territorial University building was torn down in 1908, and its former site now houses the Fairmont Olympic Hotel.\nThe sole-surviving remnants of Washington's first building are four , white, hand-fluted cedar, Ionic columns. They were salvaged by Edmond S. Meany, one of the university's first graduates and former head of its history department. Meany and his colleague, Dean Herbert T. Condon, dubbed the columns as \"Loyalty,\" \"Industry,\" \"Faith\", and \"Efficiency\", or \"LIFE.\" The columns now stand in the Sylvan Grove Theater.\n20th-century expansion.\nOrganizers of the 1909 Alaska\u2013Yukon\u2013Pacific Exposition eyed the still largely undeveloped campus as a prime setting for their world's fair. They came to an agreement with Washington's Board of Regents that allowed them to use the campus grounds for the exposition, surrounding today's Drumheller Fountain facing towards Mount Rainier. In exchange, organizers agreed Washington would take over the campus and its development after the fair's conclusion. This arrangement led to a detailed site plan and several new buildings, prepared in part by John Charles Olmsted. The plan was later incorporated into the overall UW campus master plan, permanently affecting the campus layout.\nBoth World Wars brought the military to campus, with certain facilities temporarily lent to the federal government. In spite of this, subsequent post-war periods were times of dramatic growth for the university. The period between the wars saw a significant expansion of the upper campus. Construction of the Liberal Arts Quadrangle, known to students as \"The Quad,\" began in 1916 and continued to 1939. The university's architectural centerpiece, Suzzallo Library, was built in 1926 and expanded in 1935.\nIn 1942, all persons of Japanese ancestry in the Seattle area were forced into inland internment camps as part of Executive Order 9066 following the attack on Pearl Harbor. During this difficult time, university president Lee Paul Sieg took an active and sympathetic leadership role in advocating for and facilitating the transfer of Japanese American students to universities and colleges away from the Pacific Coast to help them avoid the mass incarceration. Nevertheless, many Japanese American students and \"soon-to-be\" graduates were unable to transfer successfully in the short time window or receive diplomas before being incarcerated. It was only many years later that they were recognized for their accomplishments, during the University of Washington's Long Journey Home ceremonial event that was held in May 2008.\nOn October 2, 1946, the University of Washington formally opened a medical school as part of a School of Health Sciences against the Washington State Medical Association's oppositions, who did not wish to create a competitive surplus of physicians. The operation was spearheaded by President Henry Suzzallo based on plans created by Gideon Weed, Rufus Willard, and Thomas Minor earlier in 1884. The G.I. Bill was later created and passed, establishing the School of Health Sciences while providing $3.75 million for buildings and $450,000 for salaries. This was the foundation for the University of Washington Medical Center, ranked by \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" as one of the top ten hospitals in the nation. The School of Health Sciences was later renamed the School of Medicine in 1946, which is now consistently ranked as the top medical school in the United States. The University of Washington's role as a medical school sharply drew more attention after the World War II boom in wartime industry and economics.\nJ. Robert Oppenheimer was nominated in 1954 by the University of Washington's Physics Department to lecture physics students for one week, but was unable to attend because of loyalty checks asked for by the US Federal Government. Oppenheimer never accepted the invitations, and President Dr. Henry Schmitz disapproved of his nomination.\nFrom 1958 to 1973, the University of Washington saw a tremendous growth in student enrollment, its faculties and operating budget, and also its prestige under the leadership of Charles Odegaard. During this period, the faculty was sharply divided over the issues of the role of the faculty in faculty appointments, and the conflict of who should run the University, the faculty or the parents and taxpayers. Henry Schmitz characterized the matter as \"an internal power struggle.\" UW student enrollment had more than doubled to 34,000 as the baby boom generation came of age.\nThe University of Washington has a long history with civil rights starting from 1874, through 1899 with civil activism and through 1968 to 1975. This era was also marked by high levels of student activism, as was the case at many American universities. Much of the unrest focused around civil rights, actively seen when football coach Jim Owens suspended four Black football players on October 30, 1969, for \"[a] lack of commitment to the team,\" after which activists demanded Owen's resignation and the rest of the black football players on the team refused to play. For a time, activists had been passionate as to incite a response from school administration to occupy the campus after the activists harmed 17 persons. African American Dr. Robert Flennaugh was appointed to the UW Board of Regents on March 25, 1970 and later on June 22 the \"University of Washington Daily\" eliminated gender-based help ads. Activism peaked in 1975 when 2,000 students protested university hiring practices on the campus through May 13 and 14. Further opposition to the Vietnam War occurred, and in response to anti-Vietnam War protests by the late 1960s, the University Safety and Security Division became the University of Washington Police Department. On June 29, 1969, a bomb detonated on campus, causing $100,000 in damages and no injuries. No group claimed responsibility for the incident.\nOdegaard instituted a vision of building a \"community of scholars\", convincing the Washington State legislatures to increase investment in the university. Washington senators, such as Henry M. Jackson and Warren G. Magnuson, also used their political clout to gather research funds for UW. The results included an increase in the operating budget from $37 million in 1958 to over $400 million in 1973, solidifying UW as a top recipient of federal research funds in the United States. The establishment of technology giants such as Microsoft, Boeing and Amazon in the local area also proved to be highly influential in the UW's fortunes, not only improving graduate prospects but also helping to attract millions of dollars in university and research funding through its distinguished faculty and extensive alumni network. \n21st century.\nIn 1990, the University of Washington opened its additional campuses in Bothell and Tacoma. Originally designed for students who had completed two years of higher education, both schools have since evolved into four-year universities with the authority to award degrees. The first freshman classes were admitted in the fall of 2006. Today, both the Bothell and Tacoma campuses also offer a range of master's degree programs.\nIn 2012, the university began exploring plans and governmental approval to expand the main Seattle campus, including significant increases in student housing, teaching facilities for the growing student body and faculty, as well as expanded public transit options. The University of Washington light rail station was completed in March 2016, connecting Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood to the UW Husky Stadium within five minutes of rail travel time. It offers a previously unavailable option of transportation into and out of the campus, designed specifically to reduce dependence on private vehicles, bicycles and local King County buses.\nControversies.\nOn January 23, 1939, the University of Washington was criticized for hiring Economics Professor Harold J. Laski, a British Marxist, as a visiting lecturer in between the First Red Scare and Second Red Scare. The University of Washington was highly suspect by the Truman Administration in 1948 and 1949. Thomas H. Bienz, a Democratic State senator, declared that \"At least 150 [University faculty members] are Communists\" and soon thereafter two investigations were started by the Canwell Committee and the University. Professor of philosophy Herbert Phillips, professor of old English literature Joe Butterworth and professor of social psychology Ralph Gundlach were dismissed after the investigations. A year after, another second investigation was commenced by the Joint Legislative Fact-finding Committee on Un-American Activities in the State of Washington, leading to investigations into other professors with a response of \"One hundred and three professors [signing] an open letter to the University of Washington Board of Regents that stated the firings were based on guilt by association. The letter also declared that faculty morale and the University's reputation was damaged.\"\nThe original proposal of the University included increases for research scientists of about 10% over three years plus changes in the pay structure and a catch-up increase of 3.25% for those who did not get a merit raise last year. For postdocs, the original UW offer was an average 15% total wage increase in 2023, including 13% in January when new minimums were introduced, plus higher minimum salaries.\nCampus.\nUW's main campus is situated in Seattle, by the shores of Union and Portage Bays with views of the Cascade Range to the east, and the Olympic Mountains to the west. The site encompasses bounded by N.E. 45th Street on the north, N.E. Pacific Street on the south, Montlake Boulevard N.E. on the east, and 15th Avenue N.E. on the west.\nRed Square is the heart of the campus, surrounded by landmark buildings and artworks, such as Suzzallo Library, the \"Broken Obelisk\", and the statue of George Washington. It functions as the central hub for students and hosts a variety of events annually. University Way, known locally as \"The Ave\", lies nearby and is a focus for much student life at the university.\nNorth Campus.\nNorth Campus features some of UW's most recognized landscapes as well as landmarks, stretching from the signature University of Washington Quad directly north of Red Square to N.E. 45th Street, and encompasses a number of the university's most historical academic, research, housing, parking, recreational and administrative buildings. With UW's continued growth, administrators proposed a new, multimillion-dollar, multi-phase development plan in late 2014 to refine portions of the North Campus, renovating and replacing old student housing with new LEED-certified complexes, introducing new academic facilities, sports fields, open greenery, and museums. The UW Foster School of Business, School of Law, and the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture, which houses a significant number of exhibits including a 66-million-year-old Tyrannosaurus rex fossil skull \u2013 one of only 15 known to exist in the world today and part of an ongoing excavation, are also located in North Campus. The U District light rail station is just west of the Burke Museum.\nSouth Campus.\nSouth Campus occupies the land between Pacific Street and the Lake Washington Ship Canal. The land was previously the site of the University Golf Course but was given up to construct a building for the School of Medicine. Today, South Campus is the location of UW's health sciences and natural sciences facilities, including the UW Medical Center and the Magnuson Health Sciences Center as well as locations for instruction and research in oceanography, bioengineering, biology, genome sciences, hydraulics, and comparative medicine.\nEast Campus.\nThe East Campus area stretches east of Montlake Boulevard to Laurelhurst and is largely taken up by wetlands and Huskies sports facilities and recreation fields, including Husky Stadium, Hec Edmundson Pavilion, and Husky Ballpark. The area directly north of the sports facilities is home to UW's computer science and engineering programs, which includes computer labs once used by Paul G. Allen and Bill Gates for their prior venture before establishing Microsoft. In 2019, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Center For Computer Science &amp; Engineering opened in East Campus. Located adjacent is the Mechanical Engineering Building, home to the Industrial and Systems Engineering program. The area northeast of the sports facilities is occupied by components of the UW Botanic Gardens, such as the Union Bay Natural Area, the UW Farm, and the Center for Urban Horticulture. Further east is the Ceramic and Metal Arts Building and Laurel Village, which provides family housing for registered full-time students. East Campus is also the location of the UW light rail station.\nWest Campus.\nWest Campus consists of mainly modernist structures located on city streets, and stretches between 15th Avenue and Interstate 5 from the Ship Canal, to N.E. 41st Street. It is home to the College of Built Environments, School of Social Work, Fishery Sciences Building, Applied Physics Laboratory, UW Police Department as well as many of the university's apartments such as Stevens Court and Mercer Court and residence halls Alder, Lander, Maple and Elm Hall.\nAdministration.\nBoard of Regents.\nThe University of Washington Board of Regents governs the University of Washington per the Revised Code of Washington 28B.20.130 statute. The board is responsible for selecting, overseeing, and assessing the university president. Generally, the Board of Regents entrusts the president with the daily operations of the university, in collaboration with the faculty and in line with legal provisions.\nThe Board of Regents is made up of eleven members, including one student member and one faculty member. Regents are appointed by the governor of the State of Washington for six-year terms, except for the Student Regent (who serves for one year) and the Faculty Regent (who serves for three years). Regents continue to serve after their terms have ended until either they resign or the governor appoints a successor. Officers of the board are elected annually at the September meeting.\nOne of the most notable former regents is William Henry Gates II, the father of Bill Gates. William Henry Gates II served as a regent from 1997 to 2012.\nPresident.\nThe president of the University of Washington, Ana Mari Cauce, was selected by the Board of Regents, effective October 13, 2015. On November 12, 2015, the Board of Regents approved a five-year contract for Cauce, awarding her yearly compensation of $910,000. Cauce's compensation package includes an annual salary of $697,500, $150,000 per year in deferred compensation, an annual $50,500 contribution into a retirement account, and a $12,000 annual automobile allowance. She was the Interim President before her appointment, fulfilling the position left vacant by the previous President Michael K. Young when he was announced to be Texas A&amp;M University's next president on February 3, 2015. Phyllis Wise, who had served at UW as provost and executive vice president, and as interim president for a year, was named the chancellor of the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign in August 2011. Cauce has announced she plans to step down after her second term is complete in 2025. On February 3, 2025, the Board of Regents announced that Robert J. Jones will take her place as the 34th president of the University of Washington.\nColleges and schools.\nThe university has the following colleges and schools:\nFinance.\nIn 2017 the university reported $4.893 billion in revenues and $5.666 billion in expenses, resulting in an operating loss of $774 million. This loss was offset by $342 million in state appropriations, $443 million in investment income, $166 million in gifts, and $185 million of other non-operating revenues. Thus, the university's net position increased by $363 million in 2017.\nDonors.\nThe university is funded in part by donations from philanthropists, foundations, and corporations, as well as individual donors. Bill Gates Sr. and his son Bill Gates, as well as Melinda French Gates and the Gates Foundation, are described as having an \"unmatched\" impact across the entire university.\nAs of 2020, the university's Honor Roll of Donors recognized top contributors as including Bill Gates, Melinda Gates, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, Microsoft, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and the late Paul G. Allen. Additional notable donors include Amazon, AstraZeneca, Bayer, BlackRock, Boeing, Burroughs Wellcome Fund, Carnegie Corporation of New York, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, China Medical Board, Eli Lilly and Company, Gilead Sciences, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck, Monsanto, Novartis, Open Philanthropy, Open Society Foundations, Pfizer, Rockefeller Foundation, and Wellcome Trust.\nEndowment.\nEndowed gifts are commingled in the university's Consolidated Endowment Fund, managed by an internal investment company at an annual cost of approximately $6.2 million. The university reported $443.383 million of investment income in fiscal year 2017.\nSustainability.\nEnvironmental sustainability has long been a major focus of the university's Board of Regents and Presidents. In February 2006, UW joined a partnership with Seattle City Light as part of their Green Up Program, ensuring that all of Seattle campus' electricity is supplied by and purchased from renewable sources. In 2010, then UW President Emmert furthered the university's efforts with a host of other universities across the U.S., and signed the American College &amp; University Presidents' Climate Commitment. UW created a Climate Action Team, as well as an Environmental Stewardship Advisory Committee (ESAC) which keeps track of UW's greenhouse gas emissions and carbon footprint. Policies were enacted with environmental stewardship in mind, and institutional support was provided to assist with campus sustainability.\nOverall, the University of Washington was one of several universities to receive the highest grade, \"A\u2212\", on the Sustainable Endowments Institute's College Sustainability Report Card in 2011.\nInternational collaboration.\nThe University of Washington is an active member of the University of the Arctic. UArctic is an international cooperative network based in the Circumpolar Arctic region, consisting of more than 200 universities, colleges, and other organizations with an interest in promoting education and research in the Arctic region.\nThe university also participates in UArctic's mobility program north2north. The aim of that program is to enable students of member institutions to study in different parts of the North.\nAcademics.\nThe university offers bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees through its 140 departments, themselves organized into various colleges and schools. It also continues to operate a Transition School and Early Entrance Program on campus, which first began in 1977.\nRankings and reputation.\nUW is an elected member of the American Association of Universities, and has been listed as a \"Public Ivy\" in Greene's Guides since 2001.\nThe \"Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU)\" has consistently ranked UW as one of the top 20 universities worldwide every year since its first release. In 2019, UW ranked 14th worldwide out of 500 by the \"ARWU\", 26th worldwide out of 981 in the \"Times Higher Education World University Rankings\", and 28th worldwide out of 101 in the \"Times\" World Reputation Rankings. Meanwhile, \"QS World University Rankings\" ranked it 68th worldwide, out of over 900.\n\"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" ranked UW 6th out of nearly 1,500 universities worldwide for 2024, with UW's undergraduate program tied for 40th among 389 national universities in the U.S. and tied for 19th among 209 public universities.\nIn 2019, it ranked 10th among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.\nIn 2019, \"Kiplinger\" magazine's review of \"top college values\" named UW 5th for in-state students and 10th for out-of-state students among U.S. public colleges, and 84th overall out of 500 schools. In the \"Washington Monthly\" National University Rankings UW was ranked 15th domestically in 2018, based on its contribution to the public good as measured by social mobility, research, and promoting public service.\nIn 2017, the \"Leiden Ranking\", which focuses on science and the impact of scientific publications among the world's 500 major universities, ranked UW 12th globally and 5th in the U.S.\nUndergraduate admissions.\nThe university does not require submission of either SAT or ACT scores for admission, and the university position is that those scores are \"not considered for admission, even if submitted (test blind)\". In 2024, newly enrolled students had a median high school GPA of 3.82. The university's undergraduate admissions process is rated 91/99 by the Princeton Review, and is classified \"more selective\" by the \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\". For the Class of 2025 (enrolled fall 2021), UW received 48,840 applications and accepted 26,121 (53.5%). Of those accepted, 7,252 enrolled, a yield rate (the percentage of accepted students who choose to attend the university) of 27.8%. UW's freshman retention rate is 93%, with 84% going on to graduate within six years.\nOf the 19% of the incoming freshman class who submitted SAT scores; the middle 50 percent Composite scores were 1240\u20131450. Of the 8% of enrolled freshmen in 2021 who submitted ACT scores; the middle 50 percent Composite score was between 29 and 34. In the 2020\u20132021 academic year, 24 freshman students were National Merit Scholars.\nThe university uses capacity constrained majors, a gate-keeping process that requires most students to apply to an internal college or faculty. New applications are usually considered once or twice annually, and few students are admitted each time. The screening process is based on cumulative academic performance, recommendation letters and extracurricular activities.\nResearch.\nUW's research budget surpassed the $1.0 billion research budget milestone in 2012, and university endowments reached almost $5.0 billion by 2021.\nIn 2014, the University of Washington School of Oceanography and the UW Applied Physics Laboratory completed the construction of the first high-power underwater cabled observatory in the United States. Gabrielle Rocap, one of the researchers who discovered arsenic-breathing microbes in the Pacific, is part of the department's faculty.\nTo promote equal academic opportunity, especially for people of low income, UW launched \"Husky Promise\" in 2006. Families of income up to 65 percent of state median income or 235 percent of the federal poverty level are eligible. With this, up to 30 percent of undergraduate students may be eligible. The cut-off income level that UW set is the highest in the nation, making top-quality education available to more people. UW President Mark Emmert said that being \"elitist is not in our DNA\".\nUW was the host university of ResearchChannel program (now defunct), the only TV channel in the United States dedicated solely for the dissemination of research from academic institutions and research organizations. Participation of ResearchChannel included 36 universities, 15 research organizations, two corporate research centers and many other affiliates.\nAlan Michelson, now Head of the Built Environments Library at UW Seattle, manages the Pacific Coast Architecture Database (PCAD), which Michelson started in 2002 while he worked as Architecture and Design Librarian at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The PCAD serves as a searchable public database detailing significant but importantly, also lesser-known and -lauded designers, buildings and structures, and partnerships, with links including to bibliographic literature.\nIn 2019, iDefense reported that Chinese hackers had launched cyberattacks on dozens of academic institutions in an attempt to gain information on technology being developed for the United States Navy. Some of the targets included the University of Washington. The attacks have been underway since at least April 2017.\nStudent life.\nThe University of Washington had 50,097 total enrollments as of fall 2023, making it the largest university on the West Coast by student population in spite of its selective admissions process. It also boasts one of the most diverse student bodies within the US, with more than 50% of its undergraduate students self-identifying with minority groups.\nStudent groups.\nRegistered groups.\nThe University of Washington boasts over 800 active Registered Student Organizations (RSOs), one of the largest networks of any universities in the world. RSOs are dedicated to a wide variety of interests both in and beyond campus. Some of these interest areas include academic focus groups, cultural exchanges, environmental activities, Greek life, political/social action, religious discussions, sports, international student gatherings by country, and STEM-specific events.\nStudent government.\nThe Associated Students of the University of Washington (ASUW) is one of two student governments at the University of Washington, the other being the Graduate and Professional Student Senate. It is funded and supported by student fees, and provides services that directly and indirectly benefit them. The ASUW employs over 72 current University of Washington students, has over 500 volunteers, and spends $1.03 million annually to provide services and activities to the student body of 43,000 on-campus. The Student Senate was established in 1994 as a division of the Associated Students of the University of Washington. Student Senate is one of two official student-governed bodies and provides a broad-based discussion of issues. Currently, the ASUW Student Senate has a legislative body of over 150 senators representing a diverse set of interests on and off-campus.\nThe ASUW was incorporated in the State of Washington in 1906. The ASUW Experimental College, part of the ASUW, was created in 1968 by several University of Washington students seeking to provide the campus and surrounding community with a selection of non-credit classes not offered on the university curriculum. The Experimental College ceased operation in 2017.\nPublication.\nThe student newspaper is \"The Daily of the University of Washington\". It is the second-largest daily paper in Seattle. In 2010, \"The Daily\" launched a half-hour weekly television magazine show, \"The Daily's Double Shot\", on UWTV Channel 27. UW continues to use its proprietary UWTV channel, online and printed publications. The faculty also produce their own publications for students and alumni.\nThe \"Tyee\" was the official student yearbook of the University of Washington.\nStudent activism.\nThroughout the 20th century, UW student activism centered around a variety of national and international concerns, from nuclear energy to the Vietnam War and civil rights. In 1948, at the beginning of the McCarthyism era, students brought their activism to bear on campus by protesting the firing of three UW professors accused of communist affiliations.\nIn May 2025, pro-Palestinian protestors caused approximately $1 million in damage to the school's Interdisciplinary Engineering Building. 31 people were arrested.\nUniversity support.\nHousing.\nThe university operates one of the largest campuses of any higher education institution in the world. Despite this, growing faculty and student count has strained the regional housing supply as well as transportation facilities. Starting in 2012, UW began taking active measures to explore, plan and enact a series of campus policies to manage the annual growth. In addition to new buildings, parking and light rail stations, new building construction and renovations have been scheduled to take place through 2020. The plan includes the construction of three six-story residence halls and two apartment complexes in the west section of campus, near the existing Terry and Lander Halls, in Phase I, the renovation of six existing residence halls in Phase II, and additional new construction in Phase III. The projects will result in a net gain of approximately 2,400 beds. The Residence Hall Student Association (student government for the halls) is the second-largest student organization on campus and helps plan fun events in the halls. For students, faculty, and staff looking to live off-campus, they may also explore Off-Campus Housing Affairs.\nThe Greek system at UW has also been a prominent part of student culture for more than 115 years. It is made up of two organizational bodies, the Interfraternity Council (IFC) and the Panhellenic Association. The IFC looks over 34 fraternities with 1,900+ members, and Panhellenic consists of 19 sororities and 1,900 members. The school has additional Greek organizations that do not offer housing and are primarily special-interest.\nDisability resources.\nIn addition to the University of Washington's Disability Resources for Students (DRS) office, there is also a campus-wide DO-IT (Disabilities, Opportunities, Internetworking, and Technology) Center program that assists educational institutions to fully integrate all students, including those with disabilities, into academic life. DO-IT includes a variety of initiatives, such as the DO-IT Scholars Program, and provides information on the \"universal\" design of educational facilities for students of all levels of physical and mental ability. These design programs aim to reduce systemic barriers which could otherwise hinder the performance of some students, and may also be applied to other professional organizations and conferences.\nAthletics.\nUW students, sports teams, and alumni are called Washington Huskies. The husky was selected as the school mascot by the student committee in 1922, which replaced the \"Sun Dodger\", an abstract reference to the local weather.\nThe university participates in the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Division I FBS. It is a member of the Big Ten Conference, after having been in the Pac-12 Conference for decades prior until the 2024 conference realignment. The football team is traditionally competitive, having won the 1960 and 1991 national title and appeared in the College Football Playoff in 2016 and 2023, to go along with seven Rose Bowl victories and single wins in the Orange Bowl and Sugar Bowl. From 1907 to 1917, Washington football teams were unbeaten in 64 consecutive games, an NCAA record. Tailgating by boat has been a Husky Stadium tradition since 1920 when the stadium was first built on the shores of Lake Washington. The Apple Cup game is an annual game against cross-state rival Washington State University that was first contested in 1900 with UW leading the all-time series, 75 wins to 33 losses and 6 ties. Following the 2024 conference realignment\u2014which resulted with UW and WSU in separate conferences\u2014the schools agreed to continue the Apple Cup \"through at least 2028.\" This game was last won by the University of Washington, and the Apple Cup trophy currently resides in Seattle. College Football Hall of Fame member Don James is a former head coach.\nThe men's basketball team has been moderately successful, though recently the team has enjoyed a resurgence under coach Lorenzo Romar. With Romar as head coach, the team has been to six NCAA tournaments (2003\u20132004, 2004\u20132005, 2005\u20132006, 2008\u20132009, 2009\u20132010 and 2010\u20132011 seasons), 2 consecutive top 16 (sweet sixteen) appearances, and secured a No. 1 seed in 2005. On December 23, 2005, the men's basketball team won their 800th victory in Hec Edmundson Pavilion, the most wins for any NCAA team in its current arena.\nRowing is a longstanding tradition at the University of Washington dating back to 1901. The Washington men's crew gained international prominence by winning the gold medal at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, defeating the German and Italian crews much to the dismay of Adolf Hitler who was in attendance. The team was depicted in the 2013 bestseller \"The Boys in the Boat\". In 1958, the men's crew deepened their legend with a shocking win over Leningrad Trud's world champion rowers at the Moscow Cup, resulting in the first American sporting victory on Soviet soil, and certainly the first time a Russian crowd gave any American team a standing ovation during the Cold War. The men's crew have won 46 national titles (15 Intercollegiate Rowing Association, 1 National Collegiate Rowing Championship), 15 Olympic gold medals, two silver and five bronze. The women have 10 national titles and two Olympic gold medals. In 1997, the women's team won the NCAA championship. The Husky men are the 2015 national champions.\nRecent national champions include the softball team (2009), the men's rowing team (2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, 2011, 2009, 2007), NCAA Division I women's cross country team (2008), and the women's volleyball team (2005). Individually, Scott Roth was the 2011 NCAA men's Outdoor Pole Vault and 2011 &amp; 2010 NCAA men's Indoor Pole Vault champion. James Lepp was the 2005 NCAA men's golf champion. Ryan Brown (men's 800 meters) and Amy Lia (women's 1500 meters) won individual titles at the 2006 NCAA Track and Field Championships. Brad Walker was the 2005 NCAA men's Outdoor and Indoor Pole Vault champion.\nThe university has an extensive series of sports facilities, including but not limited to the Husky Stadium (football, track and field), the Alaska Airlines Arena at Hec Edmundson Pavilion (basketball, volleyball, and gymnastics), Husky Ballpark (baseball), Husky Softball Stadium, The Bill Quillian Tennis Stadium, The Nordstrom Tennis Center, Dempsey Indoor (Indoor track and field, football) and the Conibear Shellhouse (rowing). The golf team plays at the Washington National Golf Club and until recently, the swimming team called the Weyerhaeuser Aquatic Center and the Husky pool home. The university discontinued its men's and women's swim teams on May 1, 2009, due to budget cuts.\nHusky Stadium.\nThe rebuilt Husky Stadium is the first and primary source of income for the completely remodeled athletic district. The major remodel consisted of a new grand concourse, underground light-rail station which opened on March 19, 2016, an enclosed west end design, replacement of bleachers with individual seating, removal of track and Huskytron, as well as the installation of a new press box section, private box seating, football offices, permanent seating in the east end zone that does not block the view of Lake Washington. The project also included new and improved amenities, concession stands, and bathrooms throughout. The cost for renovating the stadium was around $280 million and was designed for a slightly lower seating capacity than its previous design, now at 70,138 seats. The university calls the stadium the \"Greatest Setting in College Football.\"\nMascot.\nThe University of Washington's costumed mascot is Harry the Husky. \"Harry the Husky\" performs at sporting and special events, and a live Alaskan Malamute, currently named Dubs II, has traditionally led the UW football team onto the field at the start of games. The school colors of purple and gold were adopted in 1892 by student vote. The choice was inspired by the first stanza of Lord Byron's \"The Destruction of Sennacherib\":&lt;poem&gt;\n The Assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold,\n And his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold;\n And the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea,\n When the blue wave rolls nightly on deep Galilee.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nThe university has also hosted a long line of Alaskan Malamutes as mascots.\nNotable alumni and faculty.\nNotable alumni of the University of Washington include NFL football player Carl Fennema (1926); U.S. Olympic rower Joe Rantz (1936); architect Minoru Yamasaki (1934); news anchor and Big Sky resort founder Chet Huntley (1934); US Senator Henry M.

Among UW students by 2012, there were 136 Fulbright Scholars, 35 Rhodes Scholars, 7 Marshall Scholars and 4 Gates Cambridge Scholars. UW is recognized as a top producer of Fulbright Scholars, ranking 2nd in the US in 2017.\nSustainable energy initiatives.\nHistory of energy at UW.\nThe first UW power plant was built simultaneously with some of the first campus buildings back in 1895, and was located to the east of campus along the existing shoreline of Lake Washington. The plant, which burned coal to produce steam to help heat and electrify the campus, was quickly replaced in 1901 as the campus\u2019 energy needs began to grow.\nThis second power plant was located where the modern day Allen Library stands. It too used a coal and steam system, and was in use for 7 years before it was put to rest and a third plant was built.\nThis third power plant, which originally consisted of two 250 horsepower coal powered boilers, remains the current site for the University of Washington's central power plant. It is located opposite Montlake Boulevard from the Intramural Activities Building (IMA). The university started their switch from coal to natural gas in 1956 and finished in 1988, motivated by growing global environmental concerns and awareness.\nAn additional power plant, the West Campus Utility Plant (WCUP), was added to campus in 2017. This plant serves as a backup power supply to research buildings on Southwest campus, and generates and stores chilled water for cooling purposes. The current capacity of this plant is 6 megawatts of emergency power and 4,500 tons of chilled water, but is expandable to double the size of both reserves with no necessary building modifications. The WCUP was awarded the Envision Gold Award from the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure for its sustainability focused building design and purposes.\nCurrent energy mix.\nFossil fuels are still tightly embedded in energy systems across the world. This is reflected in the university's energy production, as they still rely on natural gas to heat most of its buildings, despite their clean energy goals and commitments.\nIt was found that as of 2024, 93% of the university's direct greenhouse gas emissions originated from the natural gas combustion system within the UW's central power plant. The heat produced using natural gas is transported through 8 miles of underground utility tunnels that connect to campus buildings, alongside side electrical lines, communication lines, and internet cables. Although electric chillers are already in place, which cool water down as a form of AC to then be pumped into buildings through the utility tunnels, the university hopes to switch the heating processes from natural gas to electric heat pumps in order to meet their clean energy goals.\nIn contrast from the current heating systems, most of the UW's electric power is supplied by Seattle City Light, who generates the majority of their electricity through hydroelectric systems. Other sources of energy include the previously mentioned WCUP for building cooling and emergency backup electricity, as well as a number of solar installations across campus. Buildings with solar installations include Mercer Court Alder Hall, Elm Hall, the Intramural Activities Building, Maple Hall, and the Life Sciences Building.\nEnergy goals.\nAlthough the majority of the university's electricity supply is carbon-free, the iniversity hopes to completely phase out natural gas from their heating systems and to be fossil fuel free by 2035 in regard to their direct emissions.\nResearch shows that there are many aspects that contribute to universities energy consumption, such as student activity, technology use, building types, systems efficiency, and more. The university of Washington has addressed these aspects within their future energy goals. From late 2023 into the end of 2024, the University of Washington created an actionable energy systems decarbonization plan with the help from an outside energy consultant team who assisted in assessing the campuses energy needs, existing systems, and energy goals. The university's main energy-related goals include:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This frequency is the approximate upper audible limit of human hearing in healthy young adults. The physical principles of acoustic waves apply to any frequency range, including ultrasound. Ultrasonic devices operate with frequencies from 20\u00a0kHz up to several gigahertz.\nUltrasound is used in many different fields. Ultrasonic devices are used to detect objects and measure distances. Ultrasound imaging or sonography is often used in medicine. In the nondestructive testing of products and structures, ultrasound is used to detect invisible flaws. Industrially, ultrasound is used for cleaning, mixing, and accelerating chemical processes. Animals such as bats and porpoises use ultrasound for locating prey and obstacles.\nHistory.\nAcoustics, the science of sound, starts as far back as Pythagoras in the 6th century BC, who wrote on the mathematical properties of stringed instruments. Echolocation in bats was discovered by Lazzaro Spallanzani in 1794, when he demonstrated that bats hunted and navigated by inaudible sound, not vision. Francis Galton in 1893 invented the Galton whistle, an adjustable whistle that produced ultrasound, which he used to measure the hearing range of humans and other animals, demonstrating that many animals could hear sounds above the hearing range of humans.\nThe first article on the history of ultrasound was written in 1948. According to its author,\nduring the First World War, a Russian engineer named Chilowski submitted an idea for submarine detection to the French Government. The latter invited Paul Langevin, then Director of the School of Physics and Chemistry in Paris, to evaluate it. Chilowski's proposal was to excite a cylindrical, mica condenser by a high-frequency Poulsen arc at approximately 100 kHz and thus to generate an ultrasound beam for detecting submerged objects. The idea of locating underwater obstacles had been suggested prior by L. F. Richardson, following the \"Titanic\" disaster. Richardson had proposed to position a high-frequency hydraulic whistle at the focus of a mirror and use the beam for locating submerged navigational hazards. A prototype was built by Sir Charles Parsons, the inventor of the vapour turbine, but the device was found not to be suitable for this purpose.\nLangevin's device made use of the piezoelectric effect, which he had been acquainted with whilst a student at the laboratory of Jacques and Pierre Curie. Langevin calculated and built an ultrasound transducer comprising a thin sheet of quartz sandwiched between two steel plates. Langevin was the first to report cavitation-related bioeffects from ultrasound.\nDefinition.\nUltrasound is defined by the American National Standards Institute as \"sound at frequencies greater than 20\u00a0kHz\". In air at atmospheric pressure, ultrasonic waves have wavelengths of 1.9\u00a0cm or less.\nUltrasound can be generated at very high frequencies; ultrasound is used for sonochemistry at frequencies up to multiple hundreds of kilohertz. Medical imaging equipment uses frequencies in the MHz range. UHF ultrasound waves have been generated as high as the gigahertz range.\nCharacterizing extremely high-frequency ultrasound poses challenges, as such rapid movement causes waveforms to steepen and form shock waves.\nPerception.\nHumans.\nThe upper frequency limit in humans (approximately 20\u00a0kHz) is due to limitations of the middle ear. Auditory sensation can occur if high\u2010intensity ultrasound is fed directly into the human skull and reaches the cochlea through bone conduction, without passing through the middle ear.\nChildren can hear some high-pitched sounds that older adults cannot hear, because in humans the upper limit pitch of hearing tends to decrease with age. An American cell phone company has used this to create ring signals that supposedly are only audible to younger humans, but many older people can hear the signals, which may be because of the considerable variation of age-related deterioration in the upper hearing threshold.\nAnimals.\nBats use a variety of ultrasonic ranging (echolocation) techniques to detect their prey. They can detect frequencies beyond 100\u00a0kHz, possibly up to 200\u00a0kHz.\nMany insects have good ultrasonic hearing, and most of these are nocturnal insects listening for echolocating bats. These include many groups of moths, beetles, praying mantises and lacewings. Upon hearing a bat, some insects will make evasive manoeuvres to escape being caught. Ultrasonic frequencies trigger a reflex action in the noctuid moth that causes it to drop slightly in its flight to evade attack. Tiger moths also emit clicks which may disturb bats' echolocation, and in other cases may advertise the fact that they are poisonous by emitting sound.\nDogs and cats' hearing range extends into the ultrasound; the top end of a dog's hearing range is about 45\u00a0kHz, while a cat's is 64\u00a0kHz. The wild ancestors of cats and dogs evolved this higher hearing range to hear high-frequency sounds made by their preferred prey, small rodents. A dog whistle is a whistle that emits ultrasound, used for training and calling dogs. The frequency of most dog whistles is within the range of 23 to 54\u00a0kHz.\nToothed whales, including dolphins, can hear ultrasound and use such sounds in their navigational system (biosonar) to orient and to capture prey. Porpoises have the highest known upper hearing limit at around 160\u00a0kHz. Several types of fish can detect ultrasound. In the order Clupeiformes, members of the subfamily Alosinae (shad) have been shown to be able to detect sounds up to 180\u00a0kHz, while the other subfamilies (e.g. herrings) can hear only up to 4\u00a0kHz.\nNo bird species have been reported to be sensitive to ultrasound.\nCommercial ultrasonic systems have been sold for supposed indoors electronic pest control and outdoors ultrasonic algae control. However, no scientific evidence exists on the success of such devices for these purposes.\nDetection and ranging.\nNon-contact sensor.\nAn ultrasonic level or sensing system requires no contact with the target. For many processes in the medical, pharmaceutical, military and general industries this is an advantage over inline sensors that may contaminate the liquids inside a vessel or tube or that may be clogged by the product.\nBoth continuous wave and pulsed systems are used. The principle behind a pulsed-ultrasonic technology is that the transmit signal consists of short bursts of ultrasonic energy. After each burst, the electronics looks for a return signal within a small window of time corresponding to the time it takes for the energy to pass through the vessel. Only a signal received during this window will qualify for additional signal processing.\nA popular consumer application of ultrasonic ranging was the Polaroid SX-70 camera, which included a lightweight transducer system to focus the camera automatically. Polaroid later licensed this ultrasound technology and it became the basis of a variety of ultrasonic products.\nMotion sensors and flow measurement.\nA common ultrasound application is an automatic door opener, where an ultrasonic sensor detects a person's approach and opens the door. Ultrasonic sensors are also used to detect intruders; the ultrasound can cover a wide area from a single point. The flow in pipes or open channels can be measured by ultrasonic flowmeters, which measure the average velocity of flowing liquid. In rheology, an acoustic rheometer relies on the principle of ultrasound. In fluid mechanics, fluid flow can be measured using an ultrasonic flow meter.\nNondestructive testing.\nUltrasonic testing is a type of nondestructive testing commonly used to find flaws in materials and to measure the thickness of objects. Frequencies of 2 to 10\u00a0MHz are common, but for special purposes other frequencies are used. Inspection may be manual or automated and is an essential part of modern manufacturing processes. Most metals can be inspected as well as plastics and aerospace composites. Lower frequency ultrasound (50\u2013500\u00a0kHz) can also be used to inspect less dense materials such as wood, concrete and cement.\nUltrasound inspection of welded joints has been an alternative to radiography for nondestructive testing since the 1960s. Ultrasonic inspection eliminates the use of ionizing radiation, with safety and cost benefits. Ultrasound can also provide additional information such as the depth of flaws in a welded joint. Ultrasonic inspection has progressed from manual methods to computerized systems that automate much of the process. An ultrasonic test of a joint can identify the existence of flaws, measure their size, and identify their location. Not all welded materials are equally amenable to ultrasonic inspection; some materials have a large grain size that produces a high level of background noise in measurements.\nUltrasonic thickness measurement is one technique used to monitor quality of welds.\nUltrasonic range finding.\nA common use of ultrasound is in underwater range finding; this use is also called sonar. An ultrasonic pulse is generated in a particular direction. If there is an object in the path of this pulse, part or all of the pulse will be reflected back to the transmitter as an echo and can be detected through the receiver path. By measuring the difference in time between the pulse being transmitted and the echo being received, it is possible to determine the distance.\nThe measured travel time of Sonar pulses in water is strongly dependent on the temperature and the salinity of the water. Ultrasonic ranging is also applied for measurement in air and for short distances. For example, hand-held ultrasonic measuring tools can rapidly measure the layout of rooms.\nAlthough range finding underwater is performed at both sub-audible and audible frequencies for great distances (1 to several kilometers), ultrasonic range finding is used when distances are shorter and the accuracy of the distance measurement is desired to be finer. Ultrasonic measurements may be limited through barrier layers with large salinity, temperature or vortex differentials. Ranging in water varies from about hundreds to thousands of meters, but can be performed with centimeters to meters accuracy\nUltrasound Identification (USID).\nUltrasound Identification (USID) is a Real-Time Locating System (RTLS) or Indoor Positioning System (IPS) technology used to automatically track and identify the location of objects in real time using simple, inexpensive nodes (badges/tags) attached to or embedded in objects and devices, which then transmit an ultrasound signal to communicate their location to microphone sensors.\nImaging.\nThe potential for ultrasonic imaging of objects, in which a 3\u00a0GHz sound wave could produce resolution comparable to an optical image, was recognized by Sergei Sokolov in 1939. Such frequencies were not possible at the time, and what technology did exist produced relatively low-contrast images with poor sensitivity.\nUltrasonic imaging uses frequencies of 2 megahertz and higher; the shorter wavelength allows resolution of small internal details in structures and tissues. The power density is generally less than 1 watt per square centimetre to avoid heating and cavitation effects in the object under examination. Ultrasonic imaging applications include industrial nondestructive testing, quality control and medical uses.\nAcoustic microscopy.\nAcoustic microscopy is the technique of using sound waves to visualize structures too small to be resolved by the human eye. High and ultra high frequencies up to several gigahertz are used in acoustic microscopes. The reflection and diffraction of sound waves from microscopic structures can yield information not available with light.\nHuman medicine.\nMedical ultrasound is an ultrasound-based diagnostic medical imaging technique used to visualize muscles, tendons, and many internal organs to capture their size, structure and any pathological lesions with real time tomographic images. Ultrasound has been used by radiologists and sonographers to image the human body for at least 50 years and has become a widely used diagnostic tool. The technology is relatively inexpensive and portable, especially when compared with other techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT). Ultrasound is also used to visualize fetuses during routine and emergency prenatal care. Such diagnostic applications used during pregnancy are referred to as obstetric sonography. As currently applied in the medical field, properly performed ultrasound poses no known risks to the patient. Sonography does not use ionizing radiation, and the power levels used for imaging are too low to cause adverse heating or pressure effects in tissue. Although the long-term effects due to ultrasound exposure at diagnostic intensity are still unknown, currently most doctors feel that the benefits to patients outweigh the risks. The ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) principle has been advocated for an ultrasound examination\u00a0\u2013 that is, keeping the scanning time and power settings as low as possible but consistent with diagnostic imaging\u00a0\u2013 and that by that principle nonmedical uses, which by definition are not necessary, are actively discouraged.\nUltrasound is also increasingly being used in trauma and first aid cases, with emergency ultrasound being used by some EMT response teams. Furthermore, ultrasound is used in remote diagnosis cases where teleconsultation is required, such as scientific experiments in space or mobile sports team diagnosis.\nAccording to RadiologyInfo, ultrasounds are useful in the detection of pelvic abnormalities and can involve techniques known as abdominal (transabdominal) ultrasound, vaginal (transvaginal or endovaginal) ultrasound in women, and also rectal (transrectal) ultrasound in men.\nVeterinary medicine.\nDiagnostic ultrasound is used externally in horses for evaluation of soft tissue and tendon injuries, and internally in particular for reproductive work\u00a0\u2013 evaluation of the reproductive tract of the mare and pregnancy detection. It may also be used in an external manner in stallions for evaluation of testicular condition and diameter as well as internally for reproductive evaluation (deferent duct etc.).\nBy 2005, ultrasound technology began to be used by the beef cattle industry to improve animal health and the yield of cattle operations. Ultrasound is used to evaluate fat thickness, rib eye area, and intramuscular fat in living animals. It is also used to evaluate the health and characteristics of unborn calves.\nUltrasound technology provides a means for cattle producers to obtain information that can be used to improve the breeding and husbandry of cattle. The technology can be expensive, and it requires a substantial time commitment for continuous data collection and operator training. Nevertheless, this technology has proven useful in managing and running a cattle breeding operation.\nProcessing and power.\nHigh-power applications of ultrasound often use frequencies between 20\u00a0kHz and a few hundred kHz. Intensities can be very high; above 10 watts per square centimeter, cavitation can be inducted in liquid media, and some applications use up to 1000 watts per square centimeter. Such high intensities can induce chemical changes or produce significant effects by direct mechanical action, and can inactivate harmful microorganisms.\nPhysical therapy.\nUltrasound has been used since the 1940s by physical and occupational therapists for treating connective tissue: ligaments, tendons, and fascia (and also scar tissue). Conditions for which ultrasound may be used for treatment include the follow examples: ligament sprains, muscle strains, tendonitis, joint inflammation, plantar fasciitis, metatarsalgia, facet irritation, impingement syndrome, bursitis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and scar tissue adhesion.\nRelatively high power ultrasound can break up stony deposits or tissue, increase skin permeability, accelerate the effect of drugs in a targeted area, assist in the measurement of the elastic properties of tissue, and can be used to sort cells or small particles for research.\nUltrasonic impact treatment.\nUltrasonic impact treatment (UIT) uses ultrasound to enhance the mechanical and physical properties of metals. It is a metallurgical processing technique in which ultrasonic energy is applied to a metal object. Ultrasonic treatment can result in controlled residual compressive stress, grain refinement and grain size reduction. Low and high cycle fatigue are enhanced and have been documented to provide increases up to ten times greater than non-UIT specimens. Additionally, UIT has proven effective in addressing stress corrosion cracking, corrosion fatigue and related issues.\nWhen the UIT tool, made up of the ultrasonic transducer, pins and other components, comes into contact with the work piece it acoustically couples with the work piece, creating harmonic resonance. This harmonic resonance is performed at a carefully calibrated frequency, to which metals respond very favorably.\nDepending on the desired effects of treatment a combination of different frequencies and displacement amplitude is applied. These frequencies range between 25 and 55\u00a0kHz, with the displacement amplitude of the resonant body of between 22 and 50\u00a0\u03bcm (0.00087 and 0.0020 in).\nUIT devices rely on magnetostrictive transducers.\nProcessing.\nUltrasonication offers great potential in the processing of liquids and slurries, by improving the mixing and chemical reactions in various applications and industries. Ultrasonication generates alternating low-pressure and high-pressure waves in liquids, leading to the formation and violent collapse of small vacuum bubbles. This phenomenon is termed cavitation and causes high speed impinging liquid jets and strong hydrodynamic shear-forces. These effects are used for the deagglomeration and milling of micrometre and nanometre-size materials as well as for the disintegration of cells or the mixing of reactants. In this aspect, ultrasonication is an alternative to high-speed mixers and agitator bead mills. Ultrasonic foils under the moving wire in a paper machine will use the shock waves from the imploding bubbles to distribute the cellulose fibres more uniformly in the produced paper web, which will make a stronger paper with more even surfaces. Furthermore, chemical reactions benefit from the free radicals created by the cavitation as well as from the energy input and the material transfer through boundary layers. For many processes, this sonochemical (see sonochemistry) effect leads to a substantial reduction in the reaction time, like in the transesterification of oil into biodiesel.\nSubstantial ultrasonic intensity and high ultrasonic vibration amplitudes are required for many processing applications, such as nano-crystallization, nano-emulsification, deagglomeration, extraction, cell disruption, as well as many others. Commonly, a process is first tested on a laboratory scale to prove feasibility and establish some of the required ultrasonic exposure parameters. After this phase is complete, the process is transferred to a pilot (bench) scale for flow-through pre-production optimization and then to an industrial scale for continuous production. During these scale-up steps, it is essential to make sure that all local exposure conditions (ultrasonic amplitude, cavitation intensity, time spent in the active cavitation zone, etc.) stay the same. If this condition is met, the quality of the final product remains at the optimized level, while the productivity is increased by a predictable \"scale-up factor\". The productivity increase results from the fact that laboratory, bench and industrial-scale ultrasonic processor systems incorporate progressively larger ultrasonic horns, able to generate progressively larger high-intensity cavitation zones and, therefore, to process more material per unit of time. This is called \"direct scalability\". It is important to point out that increasing the power of the ultrasonic processor alone does \"not\" result in direct scalability, since it may be (and frequently is) accompanied by a reduction in the ultrasonic amplitude and cavitation intensity. During direct scale-up, all processing conditions must be maintained, while the power rating of the equipment is increased in order to enable the operation of a larger ultrasonic horn.\nUltrasonic manipulation and characterization of particles.\nA researcher at the Industrial Materials Research Institute, Alessandro Malutta, devised an experiment that demonstrated the trapping action of ultrasonic standing waves on wood pulp fibers diluted in water and their parallel orienting into the equidistant pressure planes. The time to orient the fibers in equidistant planes is measured with a laser and an electro-optical sensor. This could provide the paper industry a quick on-line fiber size measurement system. A somewhat different implementation was demonstrated at Pennsylvania State University using a microchip which generated a pair of perpendicular standing surface acoustic waves allowing to position particles equidistant to each other on a grid. This experiment, called acoustic tweezers, can be used for applications in material sciences, biology, physics, chemistry and nanotechnology.\nUltrasonic cleaning.\nUltrasonic cleaners, sometimes mistakenly called \"supersonic cleaners\", are used at frequencies from 20 to 40 kHz for jewellery, lenses and other optical parts, watches, dental instruments, surgical instruments, diving regulators and industrial parts. An ultrasonic cleaner works mostly by energy released from the collapse of millions of microscopic cavitation bubbles near the dirty surface. The collapsing bubbles form tiny shockwaves that break up and disperse contaminants on the object's surface.\nUltrasonic disintegration.\nSimilar to ultrasonic cleaning, biological cells including bacteria can be disintegrated. High power ultrasound produces cavitation that facilitates particle disintegration or reactions. This has uses in biological science for analytical or chemical purposes (sonication and sonoporation) and in killing bacteria in sewage. High power ultrasound can disintegrate corn slurry and enhance liquefaction and saccharification for higher ethanol yield in dry corn milling plants.\nUltrasonic humidifier.\nThe ultrasonic humidifier, one type of nebulizer (a device that creates a very fine spray), is a popular type of humidifier. It works by vibrating a metal plate at ultrasonic frequencies to nebulize (sometimes incorrectly called \"atomize\") the water. Because the water is not heated for evaporation, it produces a cool mist. The ultrasonic pressure waves nebulize not only the water but also materials in the water including calcium, other minerals, viruses, fungi, bacteria, and other impurities. Illness caused by impurities that reside in a humidifier's reservoir fall under the heading of \"Humidifier Fever\".\nUltrasonic humidifiers are frequently used in aeroponics, where they are generally referred to as foggers.\nUltrasonic welding.\nIn ultrasonic welding of plastics, high frequency (15\u00a0kHz to 40\u00a0kHz) low amplitude vibration is used to create heat by way of friction between the materials to be joined. The interface of the two parts is specially designed to concentrate the energy for maximum weld strength.\nSonochemistry.\nPower ultrasound in the 20\u2013100\u00a0kHz range is used in chemistry. The ultrasound does not interact directly with molecules to induce the chemical change, as its typical wavelength (in the millimeter range) is too long compared to the molecules. Instead, the energy causes cavitation which generates extremes of temperature and pressure in the liquid where the reaction happens. Ultrasound also breaks up solids and removes passivating layers of inert material to give a larger surface area for the reaction to occur over. Both of these effects make the reaction faster. In 2008, Atul Kumar reported synthesis of Hantzsch esters and polyhydroquinoline derivatives via multi-component reaction protocol in aqueous micelles using ultrasound.\nUltrasound is used in extraction, using different frequencies.\nOther uses.\nWhen applied in specific configurations, ultrasound can produce short bursts of light in a phenomenon known as sonoluminescence.\nUltrasound is used when characterizing particulates through the technique of ultrasound attenuation spectroscopy or by observing electroacoustic phenomena or by transcranial pulsed ultrasound.\nWireless communication.\nAudio can be propagated by modulated ultrasound.\nA formerly popular consumer application of ultrasound was in television remote controls for adjusting volume and changing channels. Introduced by Zenith in the late 1950s, the system used a hand-held remote control containing short rod resonators struck by small hammers, and a microphone on the set. Filters and detectors discriminated between the various operations. The principal advantages were that no battery was needed in the hand-held control box and, unlike radio waves, the ultrasound was unlikely to affect neighboring sets. Ultrasound remained in use until displaced by infrared systems starting in the late 1980s.\nIn July 2015, \"The Economist\" reported that researchers at the University of California, Berkeley have conducted ultrasound studies using graphene diaphragms. The thinness and low weight of graphene combined with its strength make it an effective material to use in ultrasound communications. One suggested application of the technology would be underwater communications, where radio waves typically do not travel well.\nUltrasonic signals have been used in \"audio beacons\" for cross-device tracking of Internet users.\nSafety.\nOccupational exposure to ultrasound in excess of 120\u00a0dB may lead to hearing loss. Exposure in excess of 155\u00a0dB may produce heating effects that are harmful to the human body, and it has been calculated that exposures above 180\u00a0dB may lead to death. The UK's independent Advisory Group on Non-ionising Radiation (AGNIR) produced a report in 2010, which was published by the UK Health Protection Agency (HPA). This report recommended an exposure limit for the general public to airborne ultrasound sound pressure levels (SPL) of 70\u00a0dB (at 20\u00a0kHz), and 100\u00a0dB (at 25\u00a0kHz and above).\nIn medical ultrasound, guidelines exist to prevent inertial cavitation from happening. The risk of inertial cavitation damage is expressed by the mechanical index.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "31783", "revid": "49913377", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31783", "title": "Uyghurs", "text": "Turkic ethnic group\nThe Uyghurs, alternatively spelled Uighurs, Uygurs or Uigurs, are a Turkic ethnic group originating from and culturally affiliated with the general region of Central Asia and East Asia. The Uyghurs are recognized as the titular nationality of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in Northwest China. They are one of China's 55 officially recognized ethnic minorities.\nThe Uyghurs have traditionally inhabited a series of oases scattered across the Taklamakan Desert within the Tarim Basin. These oases historically functioned as independent states or came under the control of various civilizations, including Chinese, Mongol, Tibetan, and Turkic powers. The Uyghurs gradually started to become Islamized in the 10th century, and most Uyghurs identified as Muslims by the 16th century. Islam has since played an important role in Uyghur culture and identity.\nAn estimated 80% of Xinjiang's Uyghurs still live in the Tarim Basin. The rest of Xinjiang's Uyghurs mostly live in Yining (Ghulja), Karamay, Tacheng (Ch\u00f6chek) and \u00dcr\u00fcmqi, the capital city of Xinjiang, which is located in the historical region of Dzungaria. The largest community of Uyghurs living outside of Xinjiang are the Taoyuan Uyghurs of north-central Hunan's Taoyuan County. Significant diasporic communities of Uyghurs exist in other Turkic countries such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Turkey. Smaller communities live in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Australia, Japan, Canada, Russia, Sweden, New Zealand, and the United States.\nSince 2014, the Chinese government has been accused by various governments and organizations, such as Human Rights Watch of subjecting Uyghurs living in Xinjiang to widespread persecution, including forced sterilization and forced labor. Scholars estimate that at least one million Uyghurs have been arbitrarily detained in the Xinjiang internment camps since 2017; Chinese government officials claim that these camps, created under CCP general secretary Xi Jinping's administration, serve the goals of ensuring adherence to Chinese Communist Party (CCP) ideology, preventing separatism, fighting terrorism, and providing vocational training to Uyghurs. Various scholars, human rights organizations and governments consider abuses perpetrated against the Uyghurs to amount to crimes against humanity and genocide.\nEtymology.\nIn the Uyghur language, the ethnonym is written in Arabic script, \u0423\u0439\u0493\u0443\u0440 in Uyghur Cyrillic and \"Uyghur\" or \"Uygur\" (as the standard Chinese romanization, GB 3304\u20131991) in Latin; they are all pronounced as . In Chinese, this is transcribed into characters as / , which is romanized in pinyin as \"W\u00e9iw\u00fa'\u011br\".\nIn English, the name is officially spelled \"Uyghur\" by the Xinjiang government but also appears as \"Uighur\", \"Uigur\" and \"Uygur\" (these reflect the various Cyrillic spellings \u0423\u0438\u0493\u0443\u0440, \u0423\u0438\u0433\u0443\u0440 and \u0423\u0439\u0433\u0443\u0440). The name is usually pronounced in English as (and thus may be preceded by the indefinite article \"a\"), although some Uyghurs advocate the use of a more native pronunciation instead (which, in contrast, calls for the indefinite article \"an\").\nThe term's original meaning is unclear. Old Turkic inscriptions record the word \"uy\u0263ur\" (); an example is found on the Sudzi inscription, \"I am khan ata of Yaglaqar, came from the Uigur land.\" (). It is transcribed into Tang annals as / (Mandarin: \"Hu\u00edh\u00e9\", but probably *[\u0263u\u0252i\u0263\u0259t] in Middle Chinese). It was used as the name of one of the Turkic polities formed in the interim between the First and Second G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk Khaganates (AD630\u2013684). The \"Old History of the Five Dynasties\" records that in 788 or 809, the Chinese acceded to a Uyghur request and emended their transcription to / (Mandarin: \"Hu\u00edh\u00fa\", but [\u0263u\u0252i\u0263u\u0259t] in Middle Chinese).\nModern etymological explanations for the name \"Uyghur\" range from derivation from the verb \"follow, accommodate oneself\" and adjective \"non-rebellious\" (i.e., from Turkic \"uy/u\u00f0-\") to the verb meaning \"wake, rouse or stir\" (i.e., from Turkic \"o\u00f0\u011fur-\"). None of these is thought to be satisfactory because the sound shift of /\u00f0/ and /\u1e0f/ to /j/ does not appear to be in place by this time. The etymology therefore cannot be conclusively determined and its referent is also difficult to fix. The \"Huihe\" and \"Huihu\" seem to be a political rather than a tribal designation or it may be one group among several others collectively known as the Toquz Oghuz. The name fell out of use in the 15th century, but was reintroduced in the early 20th century by the Soviet Bolsheviks to replace the previous terms \"Turk\" and \"Turki\". The name is currently used to refer to the settled Turkic urban dwellers and farmers of the Tarim Basin who follow traditional Central Asian sedentary practices, distinguishable from the nomadic Turkic populations in Central Asia.\nThe earliest record of a Uyghur tribe appears in accounts from the Northern Wei (4th\u20136th century A.D.), wherein they were named \"Yuanhe\" (&lt; MC ZS *\"\u0266\u0289\u0250n-\u0266\u0259t\") and derived from a confederation named / ( \"High Carts\"), read as \"G\u0101och\u0113\" in Mandarin Chinese but originally with the reconstructed Middle Chinese pronunciation *[k\u0251ut\u0255\u02b0\u012da], later known as the \"Tiele\" ( / , \"Ti\u011bl\u00e8\"). \"G\u0101och\u0113\" in turn has been connected to the Uyghur \"Qangqil\" ( or \u049a\u0430\u04a3\u049b\u0438\u043b).\nIdentity.\nThroughout its history, the term \"Uyghur\" has had an increasingly expansive definition. Initially signifying only a small coalition of Tiele tribes in northern China, Mongolia and the Altai Mountains, it later denoted citizenship in the Uyghur Khaganate. Finally, it was expanded into an ethnicity whose ancestry originates with the fall of the Uyghur Khaganate in the year 842, causing Uyghur migration from Mongolia into the Tarim Basin. The Uyghurs who moved to the Tarim Basin mixed with the local Tocharians, and converted to the Tocharian religion, and adopted their culture of oasis agriculture. The fluid definition of \"Uyghur\" and the diverse ancestry of modern Uyghurs create confusion as to what constitutes true Uyghur ethnography and ethnogenesis. Contemporary scholars consider modern Uyghurs to be the descendants of a number of peoples, including the ancient Uyghurs of Mongolia migrating into the Tarim Basin after the fall of the Uyghur Khaganate, Iranic Saka tribes and other Indo-European peoples inhabiting the Tarim Basin before the arrival of the Turkic Uyghurs.\nUyghur activists identify with the Tarim mummies, the remains of an ancient population that inhabited the region, but genetic research on the mummies and their possible links to modern Uyghurs remains contentious, both for Chinese government officials concerned about ethnic separatism and for Uyghur activists who fear the findings could affect their indigenous claims.\nA genomic study published in 2021 found that these early mummies had high levels of Ancient North Eurasian ancestry (ANE, about 72%), with smaller admixture from Ancient Northeast Asians (ANA, about 28%), but no detectable Western Steppe-related ancestry. They formed a genetically isolated local population that \"adopted neighbouring pastoralist and agriculturalist practices, which allowed them to settle and thrive along the shifting riverine oases of the Taklamakan Desert.\" These mummified individuals were long suspected to have been \"Proto-Tocharian-speaking pastoralists\", ancestors of the Tocharians, but the authors of this study found no genetic connection with Indo-European-speaking migrants, particularly the Afanasievo or BMAC cultures. Zhang et al. (2025) investigated a Late Bronze Age site in the far west of the Tarim Basin, dated 1600 to 1400 BC. Its inhabitants overwhelmingly descended from the Sintashta and Andronovo population, with additional ancestry from BMAC (10%) and Tarim_EMBA (12%). Nearly all subjects belonged to Y-DNA haplogroup R-M17.\nOrigin of modern nomenclature.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Uighurs are the people whom old Russian travelers called \"Sart\" (a name they used for sedentary, Turkish-speaking Central Asians in general), while Western travelers called them Turki, in recognition of their language. The Chinese used to call them \"Ch'an-t'ou\" ('Turbaned Heads') but this term has been dropped, being considered derogatory, and the Chinese, using their own pronunciation, now called them Weiwuerh. As a matter of fact there was for centuries no 'national' name for them; people identified themselves with the oasis they came from, such as Kashgar or Turfan.\u2014\u200a\nThe term \"Uyghur\" was not used to refer to a specific existing ethnicity in the 19th century: it referred to an 'ancient people'. A late-19th-century encyclopedia entitled \"The Cyclop\u00e6dia of India and of Eastern and Southern Asia\" said \"the Uigur are the most ancient of Turkish tribes and formerly inhabited a part of Chinese Tartary (Xinjiang), now occupied by a mixed population of Turk, Mongol and Kalmuck\". Before 1921/1934, Western writers called the Turkic-speaking Muslims of the oases \"Turki\" and the Turkic Muslims who had migrated from the Tarim Basin to Ili, \u00dcr\u00fcmqi and Dzungaria in the northern portion of Xinjiang during the Qing dynasty were known as \"Taranchi\", meaning \"farmer\". The Russians and other foreigners referred to them as \"Sart\", \"Turk\" or \"Turki\". In the early 20th century they identified themselves by different names to different peoples and in response to different inquiries: they called themselves Sarts in front of Kazakhs and Kyrgyz while they called themselves \"Chantou\" if asked about their identity after first identifying as a Muslim. The term \"Chantou\" (, meaning \"Turban Head\") was used to refer to the Turkic Muslims of Altishahr (now Southern Xinjiang), including by Hui (Tungan) people. These groups of peoples often identify themselves by their originating oasis instead of an ethnicity; for example those from Kashgar may refer to themselves as Kashgarliq or Kashgari, while those from Hotan identity themselves as \"Hotani\". Other Central Asians once called all the inhabitants of Xinjiang's Southern oases Kashgari, a term still used in some regions of Pakistan. The Turkic people also used \"Musulman\", which means \"Muslim\", to describe themselves.\nRian Thum explored the concepts of identity among the ancestors of the modern Uyghurs in Altishahr (the native Uyghur name for Eastern Turkestan or Southern Xinjiang) before the adoption of the name \"Uyghur\" in the 1930s, referring to them by the name \"Altishahri\" in his article \"Modular History: Identity Maintenance before Uyghur Nationalism\". Thum indicated that Altishahri Turkis did have a sense that they were a distinctive group separate from the Turkic Andijanis to their west, the nomadic Turkic Kirghiz, the nomadic Mongol Qalmaq and the Han Chinese Khitay before they became known as Uyghurs. There was no single name used for their identity; various native names Altishahris used for identify were Altishahrlik (Altishahr person), yerlik (local), Turki and Musulm\u0101n (Muslim); the term Musulm\u0101n in this situation did not signify religious connotations, because the Altishahris exclude other Muslim peoples like the Kirghiz while identifying themselves as Musulm\u0101n. Dr. Laura J Newby says the sedentary Altishahri Turkic people considered themselves separate from other Turkic Muslims since at least the 19th century.\nThe name \"Uyghur\" reappeared after the Soviet Union took the 9th-century ethnonym from the Uyghur Khaganate, then reapplied it to all non-nomadic Turkic Muslims of Xinjiang. It followed western European orientalists like Julius Klaproth in the 19th century who revived the name and spread the use of the term to local Turkic intellectuals and a 19th-century proposal from Russian historians that modern-day Uyghurs were descended from the Kingdom of Qocho and Kara-Khanid Khanate formed after the dissolution of the Uyghur Khaganate. Historians generally agree that the adoption of the term \"Uyghur\" is based on a decision from a 1921 conference in Tashkent, attended by Turkic Muslims from the Tarim Basin (Xinjiang). There, \"Uyghur\" was chosen by them as the name of their ethnicity, although they themselves note that they were not to be confused with the Uyghur Khaganate of medieval history. According to Linda Benson, the Soviets and their client Sheng Shicai intended to foster a Uyghur nationality to divide the Muslim population of Xinjiang, whereas the various Turkic Muslim peoples preferred to identify themselves as \"Turki\", \"East Turkestani\" or \"Muslim\".\nOn the other hand, the ruling regime of China at that time, the Kuomintang, grouped all Muslims, including the Turkic-speaking people of Xinjiang, into the \"Hui nationality\". The Qing dynasty and the Kuomintang generally referred to the sedentary oasis-dwelling Turkic Muslims of Xinjiang as \"turban-headed Hui\" to differentiate them from other predominantly Muslim ethnicities in China. In the 1930s, foreigners travelers in Xinjiang such as George W. Hunter, Peter Fleming, Ella Maillart and Sven Hedin, referred to the Turkic Muslims of the region as \"Turki\" in their books. Use of the term Uyghur was unknown in Xinjiang until 1934. The area governor, Sheng Shicai, came to power, adopting the Soviet ethnographic classification instead of the Kuomintang's and became the first to promulgate the official use of the term \"Uyghur\" to describe the Turkic Muslims of Xinjiang. \"Uyghur\" replaced \"rag-head\".\nSheng Shicai's introduction of the \"Uighur\" name for the Turkic people of Xinjiang was criticized and rejected by Turki intellectuals such as Pan-Turkist Jadids and East Turkestan independence activists Muhammad Amin Bughra (Mehmet Emin) and Masud Sabri. They demanded the names \"T\u00fcrk\" or \"T\u00fcrki\" be used instead as the ethnonyms for their people. Masud Sabri viewed the Hui people as Muslim Han Chinese and separate from his people, while Bughrain criticized Sheng for his designation of Turkic Muslims into different ethnicities which could sow disunion among Turkic Muslims. After the Communist victory, the Chinese Communist Party under Chairman Mao Zedong continued the Soviet classification, using the term \"Uyghur\" to describe the modern ethnicity.\nIn current usage, \"Uyghur\" refers to settled Turkic-speaking urban dwellers and farmers of the Tarim Basin and Ili who follow traditional Central Asian sedentary practices, as distinguished from nomadic Turkic populations in Central Asia. However, Chinese government agents designate as \"Uyghur\" certain peoples with significantly divergent histories and ancestries from the main group. These include the Lopliks of Ruoqiang County and the Dolan people, thought to be closer to the Oirat Mongols and the Kyrgyz. The use of the term Uyghur led to anachronisms when describing the history of the people. In one of his books, the term Uyghur was deliberately not used by James Millward.\nAnother ethnicity, the Western Yugur of Gansu, identify themselves as the \"Yellow Uyghur\" (\"Sar\u00efq Uyghur\"). Some scholars say the Yugurs' culture, language and religion are closer to the original culture of the original Uyghur Karakorum state than is the culture of the modern Uyghur people of Xinjiang. Linguist and ethnographer S. Robert Ramsey argues for inclusion of both the Eastern and Western Yugur and the Salar as sub-groups of the Uyghur based on similar historical roots for the Yugur and on perceived linguistic similarities for the Salar.\n\"\"Turkistani\"\" is used as an alternate ethnonym by some Uyghurs. For example, the Uyghur diaspora in Arabia, adopted the identity \"\"Turkistani\". Some Uyghurs in Saudi Arabia adopted the Arabic nisba of their home city, such as \"Al-Kashgari\"\" from Kashgar. Saudi-born Uyghur Hamza Kashgari's family originated from Kashgar.\nPopulation.\nThe Uyghur population within China generally remains centered in Xinjiang region with some smaller subpopulations elsewhere in the country, such as in Taoyuan County where an estimated 5,000\u201310,000 live.\nThe size of the Uyghur population, particularly in China, has been the subject of dispute. Chinese authorities place the Uyghur population within the Xinjiang region to be just over 12 million, comprising approximately half of the total regional population. As early as 2003, however, some Uyghur groups wrote that their population was being vastly undercounted by Chinese authorities, claiming that their population actually exceeded 20 million. Population disputes have continued into the present, with some activists and groups such as the World Uyghur Congress and Uyghur American Association claiming that the Uyghur population ranges between 20 and 30 million. Some have even claimed that the real number of Uyghurs is actually 35 million. Scholars, however, have generally rejected these claims, with Professor Dru C. Gladney writing in the 2004 book \"\" that there is \"scant evidence\" to support Uyghur claims that their population within China exceeds 20 million.\nPopulation in Xinjiang.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Sticky table start/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\nGenetics.\nA study of mitochondrial DNA (2004) (therefore the matrilineal genetic contribution) found the frequency of Western Eurasian-specific haplogroup in Uyghurs to be 42.6% and East Asian haplogroup to be 57.4%. Uyghurs in Kazakhstan on the other hand were shown to have 55% European/Western Eurasian maternal mtDNA.\nA study based on paternal DNA (2005) shows West Eurasian haplogroups (J and R) in Uyghurs make up 65% to 70% and East Asian haplogroups (C, N, D and O) 30% to 35%.\nOne study by Xu et al. (2008), using samples from Hetian (Hotan) only, found Uyghurs have about an average of 60% European or West Asian (Western Eurasian) ancestry and about 40% East Asian or Siberian ancestry (Eastern Eurasian). From the same area, it is found that the proportion of Uyghur individuals with European/West Asian ancestry ranges individually from 40.3% to 84.3% while their East Asian/Siberian ancestry ranges individually from 15.7% to 59.7%. Further study by the same team showed an average of slightly greater European/West Asian component at 52% (ranging individually from 44.9% to 63.1%) in the Uyghur population in southern Xinjiang but only 47% (ranging individually from 30% to 55%) in the northern Uyghur population.\nA different study by Li et al. (2009) used a larger sample of individuals from a wider area and found a higher East Asian component of about 70% on average, while the European/West Asian component was about 30%. Overall, Uyghur show relative more similarity to \"Western East Asians\" than to \"Eastern East Asians\". The authors also cite anthropologic studies which also estimate about 30% \"Western proportions\", which are in agreement with their genetic results.\nA study (2013) based on autosomal DNA shows that average Uyghurs are closest to other Turkic people in Central Asia and China as well as various Chinese populations. The analysis of the diversity of cytochrome B further suggests Uyghurs are closer to Chinese and Siberian populations than to various Caucasoid groups in West Asia or Europe. However, there is significant genetic distance between the Xinjiang's southern Uyghurs and Chinese population, but not between the northern Uyghurs and Chinese.\nA Study (2016) of Uyghur males living in southern Xinjiang used high-resolution 26 Y-STR loci system high-resolution to infer the genetic relationships between the Uyghur population and European and Asian populations. The results showed the Uyghur population of southern Xinjiang exhibited a genetic admixture of Eastern Asian and European populations but with slightly closer relationship with European populations than to Eastern Asian populations.\nAn extensive genome study in 2017 analyzed 951 samples of Uyghurs from 14 geographical subpopulations in Xinjiang and observed a southwest and northeast differentiation in the population, partially caused by the Tianshan Mountains which form a natural barrier, with gene flows from the east and west. The study identifies four major ancestral components that may have arisen from two earlier admixed groups: one that migrated from the west harboring a West-Eurasian component associated with European ancestry (25\u201337%) and a South Asian ancestry component (12\u201320%) and one from the east, harboring a Siberian ancestry component (15\u201317%) and an East Asian ancestry component (29\u201347%). In total, Uyghurs on average are 33.3% West Eurasian, 32.9% East Asian, 17.9% South Asian, and 16% Siberian. Western parts of Xinjiang are more West Eurasian components than East Eurasian. It suggests at least two major waves of admixture, one ~3,750 years ago coinciding with the age range of the mummies with European feature found in Xinjiang, and another occurring around 750 years ago.\nA 2018 study of 206 Uyghur samples from Xinjiang, using the ancestry-informative SNP (AISNP) analysis, found that the average genetic ancestry of Uyghurs is 63.7% East Asian-related and 36.3% European-related.\nHistory.\nThe history of the Uyghur people, as with the ethnic origin of the people, is a matter of contention. Uyghur historians viewed the Uyghurs as the original inhabitants of Xinjiang with a long history. Uyghur politician and historian Muhammad Amin Bughra wrote in his book \"A History of East Turkestan\", stressing the Turkic aspects of his people, that the Turks have a continuous 9000-year-old history, while historian Turghun Almas incorporated discoveries of Tarim mummies to conclude that Uyghurs have over 6400 years of continuous history, and the World Uyghur Congress claimed a 4,000-year history in East Turkestan. However, the official Chinese view, as documented in the white paper \"History and Development of Xinjiang\", asserts that the Uyghur ethnic group formed after the collapse of the Uyghur Khaganate in 840, when the local residents of the Tarim Basin and its surrounding areas were merged with migrants from the khaganate. The name \"Uyghur\" reappeared after the Soviet Union took the 9th-century ethnonym from the Uyghur Khaganate, then reapplied it to all non-nomadic Turkic Muslims of Xinjiang. Many contemporary western scholars, however, do not consider the modern Uyghurs to be of direct linear descent from the old Uyghur Khaganate of Mongolia. Rather, they consider them to be descendants of a number of peoples, one of them the ancient Uyghurs.\nEarly history.\nDiscovery of well-preserved Tarim mummies of a people European in appearance indicates the migration of a European-looking people into the Tarim area at the beginning of the Bronze Age around 1800 BC. These people may have been of Tocharian origin, and some have suggested them to be the Yuezhi mentioned in ancient Chinese texts. The Tocharians are thought to have developed from the Indo-European speaking Afanasevo culture of Southern Siberia (c. 3500\u20132500 BC). A study published in 2021 showed that the earliest Tarim Basin cultures had high levels of Ancient North Eurasian ancestry, with smaller admixture from Northeast Asians. Later mummies overwhelmingly descended from the Sintashta and Andronovo population, with smaller admixtures from BMAC and the earlier Tarim mummies. Uyghur activist Turgun Almas claimed that Tarim mummies were Uyghurs because the earliest Uyghurs practiced shamanism and the buried mummies' orientation suggests that they had been shamanists; meanwhile, Qurban W\u00e4li claimed words written in Kharosthi and Sogdian scripts as \"Uyghur\" rather than Sogdian words absorbed into Uyghur according to other linguists.\nLater migrations brought peoples from the west and northwest to the Xinjiang region, probably speakers of various Iranian languages such as the Saka tribes, who were closely related to the European Scythians and descended from the earlier Andronovo culture, and who may have been present in the Khotan and Kashgar area in the first millennium BC, as well as the Sogdians who formed networks of trading communities across the Tarim Basin from the 4th century AD. There may also be an Indian component as the founding legend of Khotan suggests that the city was founded by Indians from ancient Taxila during the reign of Ashoka. Other people in the region mentioned in ancient Chinese texts include the Dingling as well as the Xiongnu who fought for supremacy in the region against the Chinese for several hundred years. Some Uyghur nationalists also claimed descent from the Xiongnu (according to the Chinese historical text the \"Book of Wei\", the founder of the Uyghurs was descended from a Xiongnu ruler), but the view is contested by modern Chinese scholars.\nThe Yuezhi were driven away by the Xiongnu but founded the Kushan Empire, which exerted some influence in the Tarim Basin, where Kharosthi texts have been found in Loulan, Niya and Khotan. Loulan and Khotan were some of the many city-states that existed in the Xinjiang region during the Han dynasty; others include Kucha, Turfan, Karasahr and Kashgar. These kingdoms in the Tarim Basin came under the control of China during the Han and Tang dynasties. During the Tang dynasty they were conquered and placed under the control of the Protectorate General to Pacify the West, and the Indo-European cultures of these kingdoms never recovered from Tang rule after thousands of their inhabitants were killed during the conquest. The settled population of these cities later merged with the incoming Turkic people, including the Uyghurs of Uyghur Khaganate, to form the modern Uyghurs. The Indo-European Tocharian language later disappeared as the urban population switched to a Turkic language such as the Old Uyghur language.\nThe early Turkic peoples descended from agricultural communities in Northeast Asia who moved westwards into Mongolia in the late 3rd millennium BC, where they adopted a pastoral lifestyle. By the early 1st millennium BC, these peoples had become equestrian nomads. In subsequent centuries, the steppe populations of Central Asia appear to have been progressively Turkified by East Asian nomadic Turks, moving out of Mongolia.\nUyghur Khaganate (8th\u20139th centuries).\nThe Uyghurs of the Uyghur Khaganate were part of a Turkic confederation called the Tiele, who lived in the valleys south of Lake Baikal and around the Yenisei River. They overthrew the First Turkic Khaganate and established the Uyghur Khaganate.\nThe Uyghur Khaganate lasted from 744 to 840. It was administered from the imperial capital Ordu-Baliq, one of the biggest ancient cities built in Mongolia. In 840, following a famine and civil war, the Uyghur Khaganate was overrun by the Yenisei Kirghiz, another Turkic people. As a result, the majority of tribal groups formerly under Uyghur control dispersed and moved out of Mongolia.\nUyghur kingdoms (9th\u201311th centuries).\nThe Uyghurs who founded the Uyghur Khaganate dispersed after the fall of the Khaganate, to live among the Karluks and to places such as Jimsar, Turpan and Gansu. These Uyghurs soon founded two kingdoms and the easternmost state was the Ganzhou Kingdom (870\u20131036) which ruled parts of Xinjiang, with its capital near present-day Zhangye, Gansu, China. The modern Yugurs are believed to be descendants of these Uyghurs. Ganzhou was absorbed by the Western Xia in 1036.\nThe second Uyghur kingdom, the Kingdom of Qocho ruled a larger section of Xinjiang, also known as \"Uyghuristan\" in its later period, was founded in the Turpan area with its capital in Qocho (modern Gaochang) and Beshbalik. The Kingdom of Qocho lasted from the ninth to the fourteenth century and proved to be longer-lasting than any power in the region, before or since. The Uyghurs were originally Tengrists, shamanists, and Manichaean, but converted to Buddhism during this period. Qocho accepted the Qara Khitai as its overlord in the 1130s, and in 1209 submitted voluntarily to the rising Mongol Empire. The Uyghurs of Kingdom of Qocho were allowed significant autonomy and played an important role as civil servants to the Mongol Empire, but was finally destroyed by the Chagatai Khanate by the end of the 14th century.\nIslamization.\nIn the tenth century, the Karluks, Yagmas, Chigils and other Turkic tribes founded the Kara-Khanid Khanate in Semirechye, Western Tian Shan, and Kashgaria and later conquered Transoxiana. The Karakhanid rulers were likely to be Yaghmas who were associated with the Toquz Oghuz and some historians therefore see this as a link between the Karakhanid and the Uyghurs of the Uyghur Khaganate, although this connection is disputed by others.\nThe Karakhanids converted to Islam in the tenth century beginning with Sultan Satuq Bughra Khan, the first Turkic dynasty to do so. Modern Uyghurs see the Muslim Karakhanids as an important part of their history; however, Islamization of the people of the Tarim Basin was a gradual process. The Indo-Iranian Saka Buddhist Kingdom of Khotan was conquered by the Turkic Muslim Karakhanids from Kashgar in the early 11th century, but Uyghur Qocho remained mainly Buddhist until the 15th century, and the conversion of the Uyghur people to Islam was not completed until the 17th century.\nThe 12th and 13th century saw the domination by non-Muslim powers: first the Kara-Khitans in the 12th century, followed by the Mongols in the 13th century. After the death of Genghis Khan in 1227, Transoxiana and Kashgar became the domain of his second son, Chagatai Khan. The Chagatai Khanate split into two in the 1340s, and the area of the Chagatai Khanate where the modern Uyghurs live became part of Moghulistan, which meant \"land of the Mongols\". In the 14th century, a Chagatayid khan Tughluq Tem\u00fcr converted to Islam, Genghisid Mongol nobilities also followed him to convert to Islam. His son Khizr Khoja conquered Qocho and Turfan (the core of Uyghuristan) in the 1390s, and the Uyghurs there became largely Muslim by the beginning of the 16th century. After being converted to Islam, the descendants of the previously Buddhist Uyghurs in Turfan failed to retain memory of their ancestral legacy and falsely believed that the \"infidel Kalmuks\" (Dzungars) were the ones who built Buddhist structures in their area.\nFrom the late 14th through 17th centuries, the Xinjiang region became further subdivided into Moghulistan in the north, Altishahr (Kashgar and the Tarim Basin), and the Turfan area, each often ruled separately by competing Chagatayid descendants, the Dughlats, and later the Khojas.\nIslam was also spread by the Sufis, and branches of its Naqshbandi order were the Khojas who seized control of political and military affairs in the Tarim Basin and Turfan in the 17th century. The Khojas however split into two rival factions, the \"Aqtaghlik\" (\"White Mountainers\") Khojas (also called the Afaqiyya) and the \"Qarataghlik\" (\"Black Mountainers\") Khojas (also called the Ishaqiyya). The legacy of the Khojas lasted until the 19th century. The Qarataghlik Khojas seized power in Yarkand where the Chagatai Khans ruled in the Yarkent Khanate, forcing the Aqtaghlik Afaqi Khoja into exile.\nQing rule.\nIn the 17th century, the Buddhist Dzungar Khanate grew in power in Dzungaria. The Dzungar conquest of Altishahr ended the last independent Chagatai Khanate, the Yarkent Khanate, after the Aqtaghlik Afaq Khoja sought aid from the 5th Dalai Lama and his Dzungar Buddhist followers to help him in his struggle against the Qarataghlik Khojas. The Aqtaghlik Khojas in the Tarim Basin then became vassals to the Dzungars.\nThe expansion of the Dzungars into Khalkha Mongol territory in Mongolia brought them into direct conflict with Qing China in the late 17th century, and in the process also brought Chinese presence back into the region a thousand years after Tang China lost control of the Western Regions.\nThe Dzungar\u2013Qing War lasted a decade. During the Dzungar conflict, two Aqtaghlik brothers, the so-called \"Younger Khoja\" (), also known as Khw\u0101ja-i Jah\u0101n, and his sibling, the Elder Khoja (), also known as Burh\u0101n al-D\u012bn, after being appointed as vassals in the Tarim Basin by the Dzungars, first joined the Qing and rebelled against Dzungar rule until the final Qing victory over the Dzungars, then they rebelled against the Qing in the Revolt of the Altishahr Khojas (1757\u20131759), an action which prompted the invasion and conquest of the Tarim Basin by the Qing in 1759. The Uyghurs of Turfan and Hami such as Emin Khoja were allies of the Qing in this conflict, and these Uyghurs also helped the Qing rule the Altishahr Uyghurs in the Tarim Basin.\nThe final campaign against the Dzungars in the 1750s ended with the Dzungar genocide. The Qing \"final solution\" of genocide to solve the problem of the Dzungar Mongols created a land devoid of Dzungars, which was followed by the Qing sponsored settlement of millions of other people in Dzungaria. In northern Xinjiang, the Qing brought in Han, Hui, Uyghur, Xibe, Daurs, Solons, Turkic Muslim Taranchis and Kazakh colonists, with one third of Xinjiang's total population consisting of Hui and Han in the northern area, while around two thirds were Uyghurs in southern Xinjiang's Tarim Basin. In Dzungaria, the Qing established new cities like \u00dcr\u00fcmqi and Yining. The Dzungarian basin itself is now inhabited by many Kazakhs. The Qing therefore unified Xinjiang and changed its demographic composition as well. The crushing of the Buddhist Dzungars by the Qing led to the empowerment of the Muslim Begs in southern Xinjiang, migration of Muslim Taranchis to northern Xinjiang, and increasing Turkic Muslim power, with Turkic Muslim culture and identity was tolerated or even promoted by the Qing. It was therefore argued by Henry Schwarz that \"the Qing victory was, in a certain sense, a victory for Islam\".\nIn Beijing, a community of Uyghurs was clustered around the mosque near the Forbidden City, having moved to Beijing in the 18th century.\nThe Ush rebellion in 1765 by Uyghurs against the Manchus occurred after several incidents of misrule and abuse that had caused considerable anger and resentment. The Manchu Emperor ordered that the Uyghur rebel town be massacred, and the men were executed and the women and children enslaved.\nYettishar.\nDuring the Dungan Revolt (1862\u20131877), Andijani Uzbeks from the Khanate of Kokand under Buzurg Khan and Yaqub Beg expelled Qing officials from parts of southern Xinjiang and founded an independent Kashgarian kingdom called Yettishar (\"Country of Seven Cities\"). Under the leadership of Yaqub Beg, it included Kashgar, Yarkand, Khotan, Aksu, Kucha, Korla, and Turpan. Large Qing dynasty forces under Chinese General Zuo Zongtang attacked Yettishar in 1876.\nQing reconquest.\nAfter this invasion, the two regions of Dzungaria, which had been known as the Dzungar region or the Northern marches of the Tian Shan, and the Tarim Basin, which had been known as \"Muslim land\" or southern marches of the Tian Shan, were reorganized into a province named \"Xinjiang\", meaning \"New Territory\".\nFirst East Turkestan Republic.\nIn 1912, the Qing dynasty was replaced by the Republic of China. By 1920, Pan-Turkic Jadidists had become a challenge to Chinese warlord Yang Zengxin, who controlled Xinjiang. Uyghurs staged several uprisings against Chinese rule. In 1931, the Kumul Rebellion erupted, leading to the establishment of an independent government in Khotan in 1932, which later led to the creation of the First East Turkestan Republic, officially known as the Turkish Islamic Republic of East Turkestan. Uyghurs joined with Uzbeks, Kazakhs, and Kyrgyz and successfully declared their independence on 12 November 1933. The First East Turkestan Republic was a short-lived attempt at independence around the areas encompassing Kashgar, Yarkent, and Khotan, and it was attacked during the Qumul Rebellion by a Chinese Muslim army under General Ma Zhancang and Ma Fuyuan and fell following the Battle of Kashgar (1934). The Soviets backed Chinese warlord Sheng Shicai's rule over East Turkestan/Xinjiang from 1934 to 1943. In April 1937, remnants of the First East Turkestan Republic launched an uprising known as the Islamic Rebellion in Xinjiang and briefly established an independent government, controlling areas from Atush, Kashgar, Yarkent, and even parts of Khotan, before it was crushed in October 1937, following Soviet intervention. Sheng Shicai purged 50,000 to 100,000 people, mostly Uyghurs, following this uprising.\nSecond East Turkestan Republic.\nThe oppressive reign of Sheng Shicai fueled discontent by Uyghur and other Turkic peoples of the region, and Sheng expelled Soviet advisors following U.S. support for the Kuomintang of the Republic of China. This led the Soviets to capitalize on the Uyghur and other Turkic people's discontent in the region, culminating in their support of the Ili Rebellion in October 1944. The Ili Rebellion resulted in the establishment of the Second East Turkestan Republic on 12 November 1944, in the three districts of what is now the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture. Several pro-KMT Uyghurs like Isa Yusuf Alptekin, Memet Emin Bugra, and Mesut Sabri opposed the Second East Turkestan Republic and supported the Republic of China. In the summer of 1949, the Soviets purged the thirty top leaders of the Second East Turkestan Republic and its five top officials died in a mysterious plane crash on 27 August 1949. On 13 October 1949, the People's Liberation Army entered the region and the East Turkestan National Army was merged into the PLA's 5th Army Corps, leading to the official end of the Second East Turkestan Republic on 22 December 1949.\nContemporary era.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMao declared the founding of the People's Republic of China on 1 October 1949. He turned the Second East Turkistan Republic into the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, and appointed Saifuddin Azizi as the region's first Communist Party governor. Many Republican loyalists fled into exile in Turkey and Western countries. The name Xinjiang was changed to Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, where Uyghurs are the largest ethnicity, mostly concentrated in the south-western Xinjiang.\nThe Xinjiang conflict is a separatist conflict in China's far-west province of Xinjiang, whose northern region is known as Dzungaria and whose southern region (the Tarim Basin) is known as East Turkestan. Uyghur separatists and independence groups claim that the Second East Turkestan Republic was illegally incorporated by China in 1949 and has since been under Chinese occupation.\nUyghur identity remains fragmented, as some support a Pan-Islamic vision, exemplified by the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, while others support a Pan-Turkic vision, such as the East Turkestan Liberation Organization. A third group which includes the Uyghur American Association supports a western liberal vision and hopes for a US-led intervention into Xinjiang. Some Uyghur fighters in Syria have also studied Zionism as a model for their homeland. As a result, \"no Uyghur or East Turkestan group speaks for all Uyghurs\", and Uyghurs in Pan-Turkic and Pan-Islamic camps have committed violence including assassinations on other Uyghurs who they think are too assimilated to Chinese society. Uyghur activists like Rebiya Kadeer have mainly tried to garner international support for Uyghurs, including the right to demonstrate, although China's government has accused her of orchestrating the deadly July 2009 \u00dcr\u00fcmqi riots.\nEric Enno Tamm's 2011 book stated that \"authorities have censored Uyghur writers and 'lavished funds' on official histories that depict Chinese territorial expansion into ethnic borderlands as 'unifications (tongyi), never as conquests (zhengfu) or annexations (tunbing)' \"\nHuman rights abuses against Uyghurs in Xinjiang.\nIn 2014, the Chinese government announced a \"people's war on terror\". Since then, Uyghurs in Xinjiang have been affected by extensive controls and restrictions which the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Chinese government has imposed upon their religious, cultural, economic and social lives. In order to forcibly assimilate them, the government has arbitrarily detained more than an estimated one million Uyghurs in internment camps. Human Rights Watch says that the camps have been used to indoctrinate Uyghurs and other Muslims since 2017.\nLeaked Chinese government operating procedures state that the main feature of the camps is to ensure adherence to CCP ideology, with the inmates being continuously held captive in the camps for a minimum of 12 months depending on their performance on Chinese ideology tests. \"The New York Times\" has reported inmates are required to \"sing hymns praising the Chinese Communist Party and write 'self-criticism' essays,\" and that prisoners are also subjected to physical and verbal abuse by prison guards. Chinese officials have sometimes assigned to monitor the families of current inmates, and women have been detained due to actions by their sons or husbands.\nOther policies have included forced labor, suppression of Uyghur religious practices, political indoctrination, severe ill-treatment, forced sterilization, forced contraception, and forced abortion. According to German researcher Adrian Zenz, hundreds of thousands of children have been forcibly separated from their parents and sent to boarding schools. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute estimates that some sixteen thousand mosques have been razed or damaged since 2017. Associated Press reported that from 2015 to 2018, birth rates in the mostly Uyghur regions of Hotan and Kashgar fell by more than 60%, compared to a decrease by 9.69% in the whole country. The allegation of Uyghur birth rates being lower than those of Han Chinese have been disputed by pundits from \"Pakistan Observer\", Antara, and Detik.com. The policies have drawn widespread condemnation, with some characterizing them as a genocide. In an assessment by the UN Human Rights Office, the United Nations (UN) stated that China's policies and actions in the Xinjiang region may be crimes against humanity, although it did not use the term genocide. The United States and legislatures in several countries have described the policies as a genocide. The Chinese government denies having committed human rights abuses in Xinjiang.\nUyghurs of Taoyuan, Hunan.\nAround 5,000 Uyghurs live around Taoyuan County and other parts of Changde in Hunan province. They are descended from Hala Bashi, a Uyghur leader from Turpan (Kingdom of Qocho), and his Uyghur soldiers sent to Hunan by the Ming Emperor in the 14th century to crush the Miao rebels during the Miao Rebellions in the Ming dynasty. The 1982 census recorded 4,000 Uyghurs in Hunan. They have genealogies which survive 600 years later to the present day. Genealogy keeping is a Han Chinese custom which the Hunan Uyghurs adopted. These Uyghurs were given the surname Jian by the Emperor. There is some confusion as to whether they practice Islam or not. Some say that they have assimilated with the Han and do not practice Islam anymore and only their genealogies indicate their Uyghur ancestry. Chinese news sources report that they are Muslim.\nThe Uyghur troops led by Hala were ordered by the Ming Emperor to crush Miao rebellions and were given titles by him. Jian is the predominant surname among the Uyghur in Changde, Hunan. Another group of Uyghur have the surname Sai. Hui and Uyghur have intermarried in the Hunan area. The Hui are descendants of Arabs and Han Chinese who intermarried and they share the Islamic religion with the Uyghur in Hunan. It is reported that they now number around 10,000 people. The Uyghurs in Changde are not very religious and eat pork. Older Uyghurs disapprove of this, especially elders at the mosques in Changde and they seek to draw them back to Islamic customs.\nIn addition to eating pork, the Uyghurs of Changde Hunan practice other Han Chinese customs, like ancestor worship at graves. Some Uyghurs from Xinjiang visit the Hunan Uyghurs out of curiosity or interest. Also, the Uyghurs of Hunan do not speak the Uyghur language, instead, they speak Mandarin as their native language and Arabic for religious reasons at the mosque.\nCulture.\nReligion.\nThe ancient Uyghurs believed in many local deities. These practices gave rise to shamanism and Tengrism. Uyghurs also practiced aspects of Zoroastrianism such as fire altars, and adopted Manichaeism as a state religion for the Uyghur Khaganate, possibly in 762 or 763. Ancient Uyghurs also practiced Buddhism after they moved to Qocho, and some believed in Church of the East.\nPeople in the Western Tarim Basin region began their conversion to Islam early in the Kara-Khanid Khanate period. Some pre-Islamic practices continued under Muslim rule; for example, while the Quran dictated many rules on marriage and divorce, other pre-Islamic principles based on Zoroastrianism also helped shape the laws of the land. There had been Christian conversions in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but these were suppressed by the First East Turkestan Republic government agents. Because of persecution, the churches were destroyed and the believers were scattered. According to the national census, 0.5% or 1,142 Uyghurs in Kazakhstan were Christians in 2009.\nModern Uyghurs are primarily Muslim and they are the second-largest predominantly Muslim ethnicity in China after the Hui. The majority of modern Uyghurs are Sunnis, although additional conflicts exist between Sufi and non-Sufi religious orders. While modern Uyghurs consider Islam to be part of their identity, religious observance varies between different regions. In general, Muslims in the southern region, Kashgar in particular, are more conservative. For example, women wearing the veil (a piece of cloth covering the head completely) are more common in Kashgar than some other cities. The veil, however, has been banned in cities such as \u00dcr\u00fcmqi since 2014 after it became more popular there.\nWhile the vast majority of Uyghur Muslims had been Sunni, there had been some Shia Uyghurs, mostly Ismaili with a Twelver minority. Ismaili dawah networks were known to have reached Uyghur regions in Xinjiang via Badakhshan and the Pamirs, where pockets of Nizari and Tayyibi Shia Islam were already present among Iranic and Turkic mountain communities. A minority of Uyghur Shias were Twelver. In the early 20th century, some Uyghurs had studied in Twelver Shia seminaries in Najaf and Qom and later returned to Xinjiang as Twelver Shia Muslims. During the Republican and Maoist eras in China, Shia Muslims were marginalized both nationally by the Han Chinese authorities, and regionally by Sunni Uyghur religious elites. Twelver Shia Islam was historically associated with Persians or Tajiks, limiting its adoption among Uyghurs. Nevertheless, many Uyghurs historically converted to Shia Islam.\nThere is an ethnic split between the Uyghurs and the Hui Muslims in Xinjiang and they generally worship in different mosques. The Chinese government discourages religious worship among the Uyghurs, and there is evidence of thousands of Uyghur mosques including historic ones being destroyed. According to a 2020 Australian Strategic Policy Institute report, Chinese authorities since 2017 have destroyed or damaged 16,000 mosques in Xinjiang.\nIn the early 21st century, a new trend of Islam, Salafism, emerged in Xinjiang, mostly among the Turkic population including Uyghurs, although there are Hui Salafis. These Salafis tended to demonstrate pan-Islamism and abandoned nationalism in favor of a caliphate to rule Xinjiang in the event of independence from China. Many Uyghur Salafis have allied themselves with the Turkistan Islamic Party in response to growing repression of Uyghurs by China.\nLanguage.\nThe ancient people of the Tarim Basin originally spoke different languages, such as Tocharian, Saka (Khotanese), and Gandhari. The Turkic people who moved into the region in the 9th century brought with them their languages, which slowly supplanted the original tongues of the local inhabitants. In the 11th century, Mahmud al-Kashgari noted that the Uyghurs (of Qocho) spoke a pure Turkic language, but they also still spoke another language among themselves and had two different scripts. He also noted that the people of Khotan did not know Turkic well and had their own language and script (Khotanese). Writers of the Karakhanid period, Al-Kashgari and Yusuf Balasagun, referred to their Turkic language as \"Kh\u0101q\u0101niyya\" (meaning royal) or the \"language of Kashgar\" or simply Turkic.\nThe modern Uyghur language is classified under the Karluk branch of the Turkic language family. It is closely related to \u00c4ynu, Lop, Ili Turki and Chagatay (the East Karluk languages) and slightly less closely to Uzbek (which is West Karluk). The Uyghur language is an agglutinative language and has a subject-object-verb word order. It has vowel harmony like other Turkic languages and has noun and verb cases but lacks distinction of gender forms.\nModern Uyghurs have adopted a number of scripts for their language. The Arabic script, known as the Chagatay alphabet, was adopted along with Islam. This alphabet is known as Kona Y\u00ebziq (old script). Political changes in the 20th century led to numerous reforms of the scripts, for example the Cyrillic-based Uyghur Cyrillic alphabet, a Latin Uyghur New Script and later a reformed Uyghur Arabic alphabet, which represents all vowels, unlike Kona Y\u00ebziq. A new Latin version, the Uyghur Latin alphabet, was also devised in the 21st century.\nIn the 1990s, many Uyghurs in parts of Xinjiang could not speak Mandarin Chinese.\nLiterature.\nThe literary works of the ancient Uyghurs were mostly translations of Buddhist and Manichaean religious texts, but there were also narrative, poetic and epic works apparently original to the Uyghurs. However it is the literature of the Kara-Khanid period that is considered by modern Uyghurs to be the important part of their literary traditions. Among these are Islamic religious texts and histories of Turkic peoples, and important works surviving from that era are \"Kutadgu Bilig\", \"Wisdom of Royal Glory\" by Yusuf Khass Hajib (1069\u201370), Mahmud al-Kashgari's \"D\u012bw\u0101nu l-Lu\u0121at al-Turk\", \"A Dictionary of Turkic Dialects\" (1072) and Ehmed Y\u00fckneki's \"Etebetulheqayiq\". Modern Uyghur religious literature includes the Ta\u1e95kirah, biographies of Islamic religious figures and saints. The Turki language \"Tadhkirah i Khwajagan\" was written by M. Sadiq Kashghari. Between the 1600s and 1900s many Turki-language tazkirah manuscripts devoted to stories of local sultans, martyrs and saints were written. Perhaps the most famous and best-loved pieces of modern Uyghur literature are Abdurehim \u00d6tk\u00fcr's \"Iz\", \"Oyghanghan Zimin\", Zordun Sabir's \"Anayurt\" and Ziya Samedi's novels \"Mayimkhan\" and \"Mystery of the years\".\nExiled Uyghur writers and poets, such as Muyesser Abdul'ehed, use literature to highlight the issues facing their community.\nMusic.\nMuqam is the classical musical style. The 12 Muqams are the national oral epic of the Uyghurs. The muqam system was developed among the Uyghur in northwestern China and Central Asia over approximately the last 1500 years from the Arabic maqamat modal system that has led to many musical genres among peoples of Eurasia and North Africa. Uyghurs have local muqam systems named after the oasis towns of Xinjiang, such as Dolan, Ili, Kumul and Turpan. The most fully developed at this point is the Western Tarim region's 12 muqams, which are now a large canon of music and songs recorded by the traditional performers Turdi Akhun and Omar Akhun among others in the 1950s and edited into a more systematic system. Although the folk performers probably improvized their songs, as in Turkish taksim performances, the present institutional canon is performed as fixed compositions by ensembles.\nThe Uyghur Muqam of Xinjiang has been designated by UNESCO as part of the Intangible Heritage of Humanity.\nAmannisa Khan, sometimes called Amanni Shahan (1526\u20131560), is credited with collecting and thereby preserving the Twelve Muqam. Russian scholar Pantusov writes that the Uyghurs manufactured their own musical instruments, they had 62 different kinds of musical instruments, and in every Uyghur home there used to be an instrument called a \"duttar\".\nUzbek composer Shakhida Shaimardanova uses themes from Uyghur folk music in her compositions.\nDance.\nSanam is a popular folk dance among the Uyghur people. It is commonly danced by people at weddings, festive occasions, and parties. The dance may be performed with singing and musical accompaniment. Sama is a form of group dance for Newruz (New Year) and other festivals. Other dances include the Dolan dances, Shadiyane, and Nazirkom. Some dances may alternate between singing and dancing, and Uyghur hand-drums called \"dap\" are commonly used as accompaniment for Uyghur dances.\nArt.\nDuring the late-19th and early-20th centuries, scientific and archaeological expeditions to the region of Xinjiang's Silk Road discovered numerous cave temples, monastery ruins, and wall paintings, as well as miniatures, books, and documents. There are 77 rock-cut caves at the site. Most have rectangular spaces with round arch ceilings often divided into four sections, each with a mural of Buddha. The effect is of an entire ceiling covered with hundreds of Buddha murals. Some ceilings are painted with a large Buddha surrounded by other figures, including Indians, Persians and Europeans. The quality of the murals vary with some being artistically na\u00efve while others are masterpieces of religious art.\nEducation.\nHistorically, the education level of Old Uyghur people was higher than the other ethnicities around them. The Buddhist Uyghurs of Qocho became the civil servants of Mongol Empire and Old Uyghur Buddhists enjoyed a high status in the Mongol empire. They also introduced the written script for the Mongolian language. In the Islamic era, education was provided by the mosques and madrassas. During the Qing era, Chinese Confucian schools were also set up in Xinjiang and in the late 19th century Christian missionary schools.\nIn the late nineteenth and early 20th century, schools were often located in mosques and madrassas. Mosques ran informal schools, known as mektep or \"maktab\", attached to the mosques, The \"maktab\" provided most of the education and its curriculum was primarily religious and oral. Boys and girls might be taught in separate schools, some of which offered modern secular subjects in the early 20th century. In madrasas, poetry, logic, Arabic grammar and Islamic law were taught. In the early 20th century, the Jadidists Turkic Muslims from Russia spread new ideas on education and popularized the identity of \"Turkestani\".\nIn more recent times, religious education is highly restricted in Xinjiang and the Chinese authority had sought to eradicate any religious school they considered illegal. Although Islamic private schools (Sino-Arabic schools ()) have been supported and permitted by the Chinese government in Hui Muslim areas since the 1980s, this policy does not extend to schools in Xinjiang due to fear of separatism.\nBeginning in the early 20th century, secular education became more widespread. Early in the communist era, Uyghurs had a choice of two separate secular school systems, one conducted in their own language and one offering instructions only in Chinese. Many Uyghurs linked the preservation of their cultural and religious identity with the language of instruction in schools and therefore preferred Uyghur language schools. However, from the mid-1980s onward, the Chinese government began to reduce teaching in Uyghur and starting mid-1990s also began to merge some schools from the two systems. By 2002, Xinjiang University, originally a bilingual institution, had ceased offering courses in the Uyghur language. From 2004 onward, the government policy has been that classes should be conducted in Chinese as much as possible and in some selected regions, instruction in Chinese began in the first grade. A special senior-secondary boarding school program for Uyghurs, the Xinjiang Class, with course work conducted entirely in Chinese was also established in 2000. Many schools also moved toward bilingual Chinese-Uyghur education from 2012, with teaching in the Uyghur language limited to only a few hours a week. The level of educational attainment among Uyghurs is generally lower than that of the Han Chinese; this may be due to the cost of education, the lack of proficiency in the Chinese language (now the main medium of instruction) among many Uyghurs, and poorer employment prospects for Uyghur graduates due to job discrimination in favor of Han Chinese. Uyghurs in China, unlike the Hui and Salar who are also mostly Muslim, generally do not oppose coeducation, however girls may be withdrawn from school earlier than boys.\nTraditional medicine.\nUyghur traditional medicine is known as Unani (\u0637\u0628 \u06cc\u0648\u0646\u0627\u0646\u06cc), as historically used in the Mughal Empire. Sir Percy Sykes described the medicine as \"based on the ancient Greek theory\" and mentioned how ailments and sicknesses were treated in \"Through Deserts and Oases of Central Asia\". Today, traditional medicine can still be found at street stands. Similar to other traditional medicine, diagnosis is usually made through checking the pulse, symptoms and disease history and then the pharmacist pounds up different dried herbs, making personalized medicines according to the prescription. Modern Uyghur medical hospitals adopted modern medical science and medicine and applied evidence-based pharmaceutical technology to traditional medicines. Historically, Uyghur medical knowledge has contributed to Chinese medicine in terms of medical treatments, medicinal materials and ingredients and symptom detection.\nCuisine.\nUyghur food shows both Central Asian and Chinese elements. A typical Uyghur dish is \"polu\" (or pilaf), a dish found throughout Central Asia. In a common version of the Uyghur \"polu\", carrots and mutton (or chicken) are first fried in oil with onions, then rice and water are added and the whole dish is steamed. Raisins and dried apricots may also be added. \"Kawaplar\" () or \"chuanr\" (i.e., kebabs or grilled meat) are also found here. Another common Uyghur dish is \"leghmen\" (, ), a noodle dish with a stir-fried topping (\"s\u00e4y\", from Chinese \"cai\", ) usually made from mutton and vegetables, such as tomatoes, onions, green bell peppers, chili peppers and cabbage. This dish is likely to have originated from the Chinese \"lamian\", but its flavor and preparation method are distinctively Uyghur.\nUyghur food (, ) is characterized by mutton, beef, camel (solely bactrian), chicken, goose, carrots, tomatoes, onions, peppers, eggplant, celery, various dairy foods and fruits.\nA Uyghur-style breakfast consists of tea with home-baked bread, hardened yogurt, olives, honey, raisins and almonds. Uyghurs like to treat guests with tea, naan and fruit before the main dishes are ready.\n\"Sangza\" (, ) are crispy fried wheat flour dough twists, a holiday specialty. \"Samsa\" (, ) are lamb pies baked in a special brick oven. \"Youtazi\" is steamed multi-layer bread. \"G\u00f6shnan\" (, ) are pan-grilled lamb pies. \"Pamirdin\" () are baked pies stuffed with lamb, carrots and onions. \"Shorpa\" is lamb soup (, ). Other dishes include \"Toghach\" () (a type of tandoor bread) and \"Tunurkawab\" (). \"Girde\" () is also a very popular bagel-like bread with a hard and crispy crust that is soft inside.\nA cake sold by Uyghurs is the traditional Uyghur nut cake.\nClothing.\nChapan, a coat, and doppa, a type of hat for men, is commonly worn by Uyghurs. Another type of headwear, salwa telpek (\"salwa t\u00e4lp\u00e4k\", \u0441\u0430\u043b\u0432\u0430 \u0442\u04d9\u043b\u043f\u04d9\u043a), is also worn by Uyghurs.\nIn the early 20th century, face covering veils with velvet caps trimmed with otter fur were worn in the streets by Turki women in public in Xinjiang as witnessed by the adventurer Ahmad Kamal in the 1930s. Travelers of the period Sir Percy Sykes and Ella Sykes wrote that in Kashghar women went into the bazar \"transacting business with their veils thrown back\" but mullahs tried to enforce veil wearing and were \"in the habit of beating those who show their face in the Great Bazar\". In that period, belonging to different social statuses meant a difference in how rigorously the veil was worn.\nMuslim Turkestani men traditionally cut all the hair off their head. Sir Aurel Stein observed that the \"Turki Muhammadan, accustomed to shelter this shaven head under a substantial fur-cap when the temperature is so low as it was just then\". No hair cutting for men took place on the \"ajuz ayyam\", days of the year that were considered inauspicious.\nTraditional handicrafts.\nYengisar is famous for manufacturing Uyghur handcrafted knives. The Uyghur word for knife is pichaq (, ) and the word for knifemaking (cutler) is pichaqchiliq (, ). Uyghur artisan craftsmen in Yengisar are known for their knife manufacture. Uyghur men carry such knives as part of their culture to demonstrate the masculinity of the wearer, but it has also led to ethnic tension. Limitations were placed on knife vending due to concerns over terrorism and violent assaults.\nLivelihood.\nMost Uyghurs are agriculturists. Cultivating crops in an arid region has made the Uyghurs excel in irrigation techniques. This includes the construction and maintenance of underground channels called \"karez\" that brings water from the mountains to their fields. A few of the well-known agricultural goods include apples (especially from Ghulja), sweet melons (from Hami), and grapes from Turpan. However, many Uyghurs are also employed in the mining, manufacturing, cotton, and petrochemical industries. Local handicrafts like rug-weaving and jade-carving are also important to the cottage industry of the Uyghurs.\nSome Uyghurs have been given jobs through Chinese government affirmative action programs. Uyghurs may also have difficulty receiving non-interest loans (per Islamic beliefs). The general lack of Uyghur proficiency in Mandarin Chinese also creates a barrier to access private and public sector jobs.\nNames.\nSince the arrival of Islam, most Uyghurs have used \"Arabic names\", but traditional Uyghur names and names of other origin are still used by some. After the establishment of the Soviet Union, many Uyghurs who studied in Soviet Central Asia added Russian suffixes to Russify their surnames. Names from Russia and Europe are used in Qaramay and \u00dcr\u00fcmqi by part of the population of city-dwelling Uyghurs. Others use names with hard-to-understand etymologies, with the majority dating from the Islamic era and being of Arabic or Persian derivation. Some pre-Islamic Uyghur names are preserved in Turpan and Qumul. The government has banned some two dozen Islamic names.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral and cited sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31784", "revid": "45957157", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31784", "title": "Uppsala", "text": "City in Uppland, Sweden\nUppsala ( ; ; archaically spelled \"Upsala\") is the capital of Uppsala County and the fourth-largest city in Sweden, after Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Malm\u00f6. It had 177,074 inhabitants in 2019.\nLocated north of the capital Stockholm, it is also the seat of Uppsala Municipality. Since 1164, Uppsala has been the ecclesiastical centre of Sweden, being the seat of the Archbishop of the Church of Sweden. Uppsala is home to Scandinavia's largest cathedral \u2013 Uppsala Cathedral, which was the frequent site of the coronation of the Swedish monarch until the late 19th century.\nUppsala Castle, built by King Gustav Vasa, served as one of the royal residences of the Swedish monarchs, and was expanded several times over its history, making Uppsala the secondary capital of Sweden during its greatest extent. Today, it serves as the residence of the Governor of Uppsala County.\nFounded in 1477, Uppsala University is the oldest centre of higher education in Scandinavia. Among the many scholars associated with the city are Anders Celsius, inventor of the centigrade temperature scale that now bears his name, and Carl Linnaeus, the father of taxonomy.\nOther Uppsala residents include filmmaker Ingmar Bergman, diplomat Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld, chemists J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius and Svante Arrhenius, actress Viveca Lindfors, and singer Malena Ernman.\nHistory.\nUppsala originally referred to a location a few kilometres north of the current city, now known as Gamla Uppsala (Old Uppsala). Today's Uppsala was called \"Aros,\" 'river mouth', due to its location at the time at the mouth of the River Fyris in Ekoln, a bay in Lake M\u00e4laren. The name became \"\u00d6stra Aros\" ('East Aros') to distinguish it from \"V\u00e4stra Aros\" (present-day V\u00e4ster\u00e5s).\nOld Uppsala was, according to medieval writer Adam of Bremen, the main pagan centre of Sweden, and the Temple at Uppsala contained magnificent idols of the Norse gods. The Kungs\u00e4ngen plains along the river south of Uppsala have been identified as a possible match for Fyrisvellir, the site of the Battle of Fyrisvellir in the 980s.\n\u00d6stra Aros was at that time a port town of Gamla Uppsala. In 1160, King Eric Jedvardsson was attacked and killed outside the church of \u00d6stra Aros, and later became venerated as a saint in the Catholic Church. In 1274, \u00d6stra Aros overtook Gamla Uppsala as the main regional centre, and when the cathedral of Gamla Uppsala burnt down, the archbishopric and the relics of Saint Eric were moved to \u00d6stra Aros, where the present-day Uppsala Cathedral was erected; it was inaugurated in 1435. The cathedral is built in the Gothic style and is one of the largest in northern Europe, with towers reaching .\nThe city is the site of the oldest university in Scandinavia, founded in 1477, and is where Carl Linnaeus, one of the renowned scholars of Uppsala University, lived for many years; both his house and garden can still be visited. Uppsala is also the site of the 16th-century Uppsala Castle. The city was severely damaged by a fire in 1702.\nHistorical and cultural treasures were also lost, as in many Swedish cities, from demolitions during the 1960s and 1970s, but many historic buildings remain, especially in the western part of the city. The arms bearing the lion can be traced to 1737 and have been modernised several times, most recently in 1986. The meaning of the lion is uncertain, but is likely connected to the royal lion, also depicted on the Coat of Arms of Sweden.\nIn ecclesiastical terms, the place has always belonged to Uppsala parish, from 1961 called Uppsala cathedral parish. The incorporated parts of Uppsala belong to Gamla Uppsala parish, Helga Trefaldighets parish and Vaksala parish. After parish break-up in 1974, parts of the town are located in Gottsunda parish. After further building expansion, some are also in Denmark-Funbo parish, before 2010 in Denmark parish.\nUntil 1971, the town was part of the district court for Uppsala City Hall Court and has been part of the Uppsala Court since 1971.\nGeography.\nSituated on the fertile Uppsala flatlands of muddy soil, the city features the small Fyris River (Fyris\u00e5n) flowing through the landscape surrounded by lush vegetation. Parallel to the river runs the glacial ridge of Uppsala\u00e5sen at an elevation around , the site of Uppsala's castle, from which large parts of the town can be seen. The central park \"Stadsskogen\" (literally \"City Forest\") stretches from the south far into town, with opportunities for recreation for many residential areas within walking distance.\nLocated approximately or 40 minutes by train from the capital, many Uppsala residents work in Stockholm. The train to Stockholm-Arlanda Airport takes 17 minutes, rendering the city easily accessible by air. Just like Stockholm, Uppsala is located on Sweden's east coast at the 59th parallel north.\nThe commercial centre of Uppsala is quite compact. The city has a distinct town and gown divide with clergy, royalty, and academia historically residing in the Fj\u00e4rdingen neighbourhood on the river's western shore, somewhat separated from the rest of the city, and the ensemble of cathedral, castle and university buildings has remained mostly undisturbed to this day. While some historic buildings remain on the periphery of the central core, retail commercial activity is geographically focused on a small number of blocks around the pedestrianized streets and main square on the eastern side of the river, an area that was subject to a large-scale metamorphosis during the economically booming years in the 1960s in particular. During recent decades, a significant part of retail commercial activity has shifted to shopping malls and stores situated in the outskirts of the city. Meanwhile, the built-up areas have expanded greatly, and some suburbanization has taken place. Uppsala contains multiple lakes - adding to the large amounts of rain the city tends to receive very often.\nClimate.\nUppsala lies immediately south of the 60th parallel north and has a humid continental climate (Dfb), with cold winters and warm summers. Due to its northerly location, Uppsala experiences over 18 hours of visible sunshine during the summer solstice, and under 6 hours of sunshine during the winter solstice. Despite Uppsala's northerly location, the winter is not as cold as other cities at similar latitudes, mainly due to the Gulf Stream. For example, in January Uppsala has a daily mean of . In Canada, at the same latitude, Fort Smith experiences a daily mean of .\nWith respect to record temperatures, the difference between the highest and lowest is relatively large. Uppsala's highest recorded temperature was , recorded on 9 July 1933. On the same day Ultuna, which lies a few kilometres south of the centre of Uppsala, recorded a temperature of . This is the highest temperature ever recorded in the Scandinavian Peninsula, although the same temperature was recorded in M\u00e5lilla, Sweden, 14 years later. Uppsala's lowest temperature was recorded on 24 January 1875, when the temperature dropped to . The second-lowest temperature recorded is , which makes the record one of the hardest to beat, due to the fact that temperatures in Uppsala nowadays rarely go below . The difference between the two records is .\nThe warmest month ever recorded is July 2018, with a daily mean of . Since 2002 Uppsala has experienced 7 months where the daily mean was or warmer, the most recent in July 2021 when the daily mean was . The coldest month ever recorded is January 1814, when the daily mean was . Between January 1814 and January 1987, Uppsala experienced 23 months that were colder than . Since February 1987, the coldest month recorded is . The warmest year ever recorded was 2014, with an average temperature of . The second warmest is 2018, with . Since 1991, Uppsala has recorded 15 years with an average temperature of or warmer. The coldest year ever recorded was 1867, with an average temperature of . 1987 was the last year Uppsala recorded a year with an average temperature below .\nThe climate table below presents weather data from 1981 to 2010. According to ongoing measurements, the temperature has increased during 1981\u20132010 as compared with the 1951\u20131980 series. This increase is on an annual basis around 0.9\u00a0\u00b0C. Warming is most pronounced during the winter and spring. January, February, and March have had the most pronouncing increase in temperature, with each month increasing 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C or more. The only month that did not get warmer is June, which got 0.3\u00a0\u00b0C colder. During the 20th century, Uppsala has warmed drastically, especially the winter. If compared to the period 1861\u20131890, the annual increase in temperature is 1.8\u00a0\u00b0C. March is the month with the biggest increase, where the temperature has increased more than 3\u00a0\u00b0C since the latter parts of the 19th century.\nWinter normally arrives in late November, and lasts until the middle of March when spring arrives. Summer usually arrives in the middle of May, and lasts until late September when autumn arrives. Precipitation is most common between June and November, in all these months it falls or more on average. August receives most precipitation with . Between January and May precipitation levels fall a bit, with all months receiving less than on average. Annual precipitation is . Rainfall can occur all year round, although it is less common in January and February. Snowfall mainly occurs between November and March. Snowfall in October and April can happen from time to time, but not every year. During the night between 30 April and 1 May 2014, approximately of snow fell in Uppsala, the first recorded snowfall in May since 1981. Uppsala has an annual average snow cover around 100 days.\nEconomy.\nUppsala has economic development in many sectors. Today Uppsala is well established in medical research and recognised for its leading position in biotechnology.\nMuseums and sights.\nThe Fyris river (Fyris\u00e5n) neatly divides the city into two different parts: the historic quarter to the west of the river and the modern administrative, residential and commercial city centre to the east. Most of the historical sights and university buildings are in the western part, with a medieval street layout, river views and parks and dominated by the cathedral.\nThe most outstanding building in Uppsala is the \"Domkyrka\" (Uppsala Cathedral), Scandinavia's largest church building ( high). Together with Uppsala Castle it has dominated Uppsala's skyline since its construction in the 13th century and can be seen from a long distance outside the city, other tall buildings being rare.\nFacing the west end of the cathedral is the \"Gustavianum\", built in 1625 to be the main building of the university, and served as such through most of the 19th century. It contains the Museum of Nordic Antiquities, the Victoria Museum (of Egyptian antiquities) and the university's cultural history collections. It also houses a perfectly preserved 17th-century anatomical theatre (used in its time for public dissections). Next to Gustavianum is the 18th century Archbishop's Palace, the official residence of the Lutheran Archbishop of Uppsala and the primate of the Church of Sweden.\nAcross the street from the Gustavianum in the University Park stands the University Hall, erected in 1879\u201386 in Italian renaissance style. The Uppsala University Coin Cabinet is located in the university main building.\nNot far from the university stands the Uppsala University Library (\"Carolina Rediviva\"), the largest library in Sweden, with over 5 million volumes and some 60,000 manuscripts. The building was built in 1820\u201341.\nOn a circa 35-metre high hill to the southwest of the University Library stands \"Uppsala Castle\". Its construction was initiated in 1549 by King Gustav Vasa, founder of the Vasa royal dynasty. Today the castle holds several museums, among them the regional art museum, and is the residence of the Uppsala County Governor (\"landsh\u00f6vding\").\nThere are several botanical museums in Uppsala related to the world-famous 18th century botanist and zoologist Carl Linnaeus; the Botanic Garden next to the castle, the Linnaean Garden in the city centre, and Linnaeus Hammarby, Linnaeus' summer house in the countryside village of Danmarks Hammarby south of the city.\n north of Uppsala city lies \"Gamla Uppsala\" (Old Uppsala), the location of the pre-Christian settlement of Uppsala which later provided the new name for the medieval settlement further south. There are few remains, with the exception of several huge burial mounds of pre-Christian monarchs and the previous cathedral from 1164 A.D., traditionally said to be built over the old heathen temple (and recent archaeological investigations seems to support this notion). The site was a major religious centre in Scandinavia in pre-Christian times. After the old cathedral church burned down around 1240 it was only partially restored to a more modest size as it no longer was the seat of the Archbishop. The Gamla Uppsala Museum exhibits archeological finds made during excavations in Gamla Uppsala and related finds from other parts of Uppland, as well as exhibitions on the history of the site itself.\nTransportation.\nRoads.\nThe European route E4 highway passes to the east of the city and provides the main connection by road to Uppsala. Several other smaller roads, such as Riksv\u00e4g 72 and 55, connects the city with cities such as Enk\u00f6ping and Sala.\nPublic Transport.\nBuses.\nBuses within Uppsala Municipality and county are operated by UL. Bus lines in Uppsala go under two categories: city buses, and county buses. City bus lines, of which there are 15, are meant for journeys within the city. County buses, are instead meant for journeys within the wider municipality and county. The type of bus line can be seen by its colour, as city buses are painted green while county buses are painted yellow. Three city buses, 30, 31, and 32, are known as \"mjuka linjer\", literally \"soft lines\", which are fitted for the elderly and disabled, by having stops closer to places like hospitals and pharmacys, in order to reduce walking distance.\nTrains.\nUppsala Central Station is one of the busiest train stations in Sweden, with around 45 000 passengers per day. The station is served by several different train operators, with M\u00e4lart\u00e5g, SJ and SL being the primary ones, while Vy operates night trains to Narvik. \nTrains depart Uppsala Central Station in three directions. There are trains to the south, Arlanda, Stockholm and Link\u00f6ping, to the northwest, Dalarna and Sala, and to the north G\u00e4vle, Sundsvall, \u00d6stersund and to the northern half of Sweden as well as sleeper trains to Narvik in Norway.\nAirports.\nWhile Uppsala has no civilian airport of its own, Arlanda Airport is located about 30\u00a0km south of Uppsala. \u00c4rna Air Base north of Uppsala has been proposed for development as a commercial airport, but as of 2024 remains exclusively military.\nSports.\nThe largest arena in Uppsala is Fyrishov and is Sweden's fourth most visited, specialized in swimming, sports events, meetings and recreation. The facility includes areas for indoor sports, summer sport and a generous waterpark with waterslides, 50-meter pool, training pool, relaxation area and a large outdoor swimming pool. Accommodation is offered at the Fyrishov cabin area, and at the resort restaurants a good lunch or dinner can be enjoyed. Fyrishov AB's business also includes the operation of Gottsundabadet in which there is a 25-metre pool, a 10-metre children's pool and gym. The entire facility is open all year round and a large number of meetings and various events are held here annually.\nIn addition to activities within the arena Fyrishov AB runs T\u00e4vlingsstaden Uppsala in a collaboration between the sports organizers, Fyrishov AB, Uppsala, Uppsala Tourism and hotel business. Co-founded in 2006 by Fyrishov AB under the name SM-town Uppsala in 2007 but was expanded to include international events and competitions at high national level. The project aims to develop Uppsala, a leading sports town in Sweden. In 2009 there were 24 SM-competitions and major national and international competitions in Uppsala.\nAt Fyrishov the city's basketball team Uppsala Basket also plays, former KFUM Uppsala, their home games in the Swedish basketball league. There are also athletic club Uppsala, Uppsala, fencing club, Uppsala Judo Club, Sweden's oldest judo club, Uppsala volleyball companion, Upsala weightlifting club and Upsala Sims\u00e4llskap, one of the world's oldest swimmingclubs. The sport that draws the most audience is floorball. Uppsala's two teams in the Swedish Super League, Storvreta IBK and IK Sirius IBK, have Fyrishov as their home.\nOne of the most classical sports events, the Swedish bandy final, took place at Studenternas IP 1991\u20132012. After being played indoors in Stockholm 2013\u20132017, from 2018 it is again played in Uppsala. It usually attracts a spectator crowd of more than 20,000.\nOnce every year, the Uppsala Union of Science and Engineering Students arrange a river rafting in the Fyris river with rafts built from styrofoam.\nOther sports clubs located in Uppsala include:\nReferences in popular culture.\nIn the History Channel's Canadian-Irish TV series \"Vikings\", Uppsala is visited by Ragnar Lothbrok and his entourage to worship the Aesir gods and offer a human sacrifice to appease them. In that visit Lothbrok meets Uppsala's King Horik. The episode was criticised for its poorly researched depiction of Uppsala, which was shown as being located in a mountainous region, as well as of its heathen temple, which in the series was built in the style of a medieval Christian stave church.\nThe literary series Pelle Svansl\u00f6s (Peter No Tail) which follows the adventures of a cat with no tail and his friends created by author G\u00f6sta Knutsson takes place in Uppsala.\nUmberto Eco's book The Name of the Rose includes a character of a young Scandinavian monk Benno of Uppsala.\nIn the video game \"Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege\", one of the defensive operators, Fenrir, is from Uppsala.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "31792", "revid": "51039246", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31792", "title": "Utilitarianism", "text": "Ethical theory based on maximizing well-being\nIn ethical philosophy, utilitarianism is a family of normative ethical theories that prescribe actions that maximize happiness and well-being for the affected individuals. In other words, utilitarian ideas encourage actions that lead to the greatest good for the greatest number. Although different varieties of utilitarianism admit different characterizations, the basic idea that underpins them all is, in some sense, to maximize utility, which is often defined in terms of well-being or related concepts. For instance, Jeremy Bentham, the founder of utilitarianism, described \"utility\" as the capacity of actions or objects to produce benefits, such as pleasure, happiness, and good, or to prevent harm, such as pain and unhappiness, to those affected.\nUtilitarianism is a version of consequentialism, which states that the consequences of any action are the only standard of right and wrong. Unlike other forms of consequentialism, such as egoism and altruism, egalitarian utilitarianism considers either the interests of all humanity or all sentient beings equally. Proponents of utilitarianism have disagreed on a number of issues, such as whether actions should be chosen based on their likely results (\"act utilitarianism\"), or whether agents should conform to rules that maximize utility (\"rule utilitarianism\"). There is also disagreement as to whether total utility (\"total utilitarianism\") or average utility (\"average utilitarianism\") should be maximized.\nThe seeds of the theory can be found in the hedonists Aristippus and Epicurus who viewed happiness as the only good, the state consequentialism of the ancient Chinese philosopher Mozi who developed a theory to maximize benefit and minimize harm, and in the work of the medieval Indian philosopher Shantideva. The tradition of modern utilitarianism began with Jeremy Bentham, and continued with such philosophers as John Stuart Mill, Henry Sidgwick, R. M. Hare, and Peter Singer. The concept has been applied towards social welfare economics, questions of justice, the crisis of global poverty, the ethics of raising animals for food, and the importance of avoiding existential risks to humanity.\nEtymology.\n\"Benthamism\", the utilitarian philosophy founded by Jeremy Bentham, was substantially modified by his successor John Stuart Mill, who popularized the term \"utilitarianism\". In 1861, Mill noted that he had \"reason for believing himself to be the first person who brought the word utilitarian into use\", although he \"did not invent it, but adopted it from a passing expression\" in John Galt's 1821 novel \"Annals of the Parish\". However, Mill seems to have been unaware that Bentham had used the term \"utilitarian\" in his 1781 letter to George Wilson and his 1802 letter to \u00c9tienne Dumont.\nHistorical background.\nPre-modern formulations.\nThe importance of happiness as an end for humans has long been argued. Forms of hedonism were put forward by the ancient Greek philosophers Aristippus and Epicurus. Aristotle argued that \"eudaimonia\" is the highest human good. Augustine wrote that \"all men agree in desiring the last end, which is happiness\". The idea that conduct should be judged by its consequences also existed within the ancient world. Consequentialist theories were first developed by the ancient Chinese philosopher Mozi, who proposed a system that sought to maximize benefit and eliminate harm. Mohist consequentialism advocated communitarian moral goods, including political stability, population growth, and wealth, but did not support the utilitarian notion of maximizing individual happiness. \nUtilitarian ideas can also be found in the work of medieval philosophers. In medieval India, the 8th-century philosopher \u015a\u0101ntideva wrote that humanity ought \"to stop all the present and future pain and suffering of all sentient beings, and to bring about all present and future pleasure and happiness.\" In medieval Europe, happiness was explored in depth by Thomas Aquinas in his \"Summa Theologica\". During the Renaissance, one author whose work incorporated consequentialist ideas was the political philosopher Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli.\n18th century.\nUtilitarianism as a distinct ethical position only emerged in the 18th century, and although it is usually thought to have begun with Jeremy Bentham, there were earlier writers who presented theories that were strikingly similar.\nHutcheson.\nFrancis Hutcheson first introduced a key utilitarian phrase in \"An Inquiry into the Original of Our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue\" (1725): when choosing the most moral action, the amount of virtue in a particular action is proportionate to the number of people it brings happiness to. In the same way, moral evil, or \"vice\", is proportionate to the number of people made to suffer. The best action is the one that procures the greatest happiness to the greatest numbers, and the worst is the one that causes the most misery. In the first three editions of the book, Hutcheson included various mathematical algorithms \"to compute the Morality of any Actions.\" In doing so, he echoed the later-proposed hedonic calculus of Bentham.\nJohn Gay.\nSome claim that John Gay developed the first systematic theory of utilitarian ethics. In \"Concerning the Fundamental Principle of Virtue or Morality\" (1731), Gay argues that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;happiness, private happiness, is the proper or ultimate end of all our actions... each particular action may be said to have its proper and peculiar end\u2026(but)\u2026they still tend or ought to tend to something farther; as is evident from hence, viz. that a man may ask and expect a reason why either of them are pursued: now to ask the reason of any action or pursuit, is only to enquire into the end of it: but to expect a reason, i.e. an end, to be assigned for an ultimate end, is absurd. To ask why I pursue happiness, will admit of no other answer than an explanation of the terms.\nThis pursuit of happiness is given a theological basis:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Now it is evident from the nature of God, viz. his being infinitely happy in himself from all eternity, and from his goodness manifested in his works, that he could have no other design in creating mankind than their happiness; and therefore he wills their happiness; therefore the means of their happiness: therefore that my behaviour, as far as it may be a means of the happiness of mankind, should be such...thus the will of God is the immediate criterion of Virtue, and the happiness of mankind the criterion of the will of God; and therefore the happiness of mankind may be said to be the criterion of virtue, but once removed\u2026(and)\u2026I am to do whatever lies in my power towards promoting the happiness of mankind.\nHume.\nIn \"An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals\" (1751), David Hume writes:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In all determinations of morality, this circumstance of public utility is ever principally in view; and wherever disputes arise, either in philosophy or common life, concerning the bounds of duty, the question cannot, by any means, be decided with greater certainty, than by ascertaining, on any side, the true interests of mankind. If any false opinion, embraced from appearances, has been found to prevail; as soon as farther experience and sounder reasoning have given us juster notions of human affairs, we retract our first sentiment, and adjust anew the boundaries of moral good and evil.\nPaley.\nGay's theological utilitarianism was developed and popularized by William Paley. It has been claimed that Paley was not a very original thinker and that the philosophies in his treatise on ethics is \"an assemblage of ideas developed by others and is presented to be learned by students rather than debated by colleagues.\" Nevertheless, his book \"The Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy\" (1785) was a required text at Cambridge and Smith (1954) says that Paley's writings were \"once as well known in American colleges as were the readers and spellers of William McGuffey and Noah Webster in the elementary schools.\" Schneewind (1977) writes that \"utilitarianism first became widely known in England through the work of William Paley.\"\nThe now-forgotten significance of Paley can be judged from the title of Thomas Rawson Birks's 1874 work \"Modern Utilitarianism or the Systems of Paley, Bentham and Mill Examined and Compared\".\nApart from restating that happiness as an end is grounded in the nature of God, Paley also discusses the place of rules, writing:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nClassical utilitarianism.\nJeremy Bentham.\nBentham's book \"An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation\" was printed in 1780 but not published until 1789. It is possible that Bentham decided to publish after he saw the success of Paley's \"Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy\". Though Bentham's book was not an immediate success, his ideas were spread further when Pierre \u00c9tienne Louis Dumont translated edited selections from a variety of Bentham's manuscripts into French. was published in 1802 and then later retranslated back into English by Hildreth as \"The Theory of Legislation\", although by this time significant portions of Dumont's work had already been retranslated and incorporated into Sir John Bowring's edition of Bentham's works, which was issued in parts between 1838 and 1843.\nPerhaps aware that Francis Hutcheson eventually removed his algorithms for calculating the greatest happiness because they \"appear'd useless, and were disagreeable to some readers\", Bentham contends that there is nothing novel or unwarranted about his method, for \"in all this there is nothing but what the practice of mankind, wheresoever they have a clear view of their own interest, is perfectly conformable to.\"\nRosen (2003) warns that descriptions of utilitarianism can bear \"little resemblance historically to utilitarians like Bentham and J. S. Mill\" and can be more \"a crude version of act utilitarianism conceived in the twentieth century as a straw man to be attacked and rejected.\" It is a mistake to think that Bentham is not concerned with rules. His seminal work is concerned with the principles of legislation and the hedonic calculus is introduced with the words \"Pleasures then, and the avoidance of pains, are the ends that the legislator has in view.\" In Chapter VII, Bentham says: \"The business of government is to promote the happiness of the society, by punishing and rewarding... In proportion as an act tends to disturb that happiness, in proportion as the tendency of it is pernicious, will be the demand it creates for punishment.\"\nPrinciple of utility.\nBentham's work opens with a statement of the principle of utility:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHedonic calculus.\nIn Chapter IV, Bentham proposes a method of calculating the value of pleasures and pains, which has come to be known as the hedonic calculus. Bentham says that the value of a pleasure or pain, considered by itself, can be measured according to its intensity, duration, certainty/uncertainty and propinquity/remoteness. In addition, it is necessary to consider \"the tendency of any act by which it is produced\" and, therefore, to take account of the act's fecundity, or the chance it has of being followed by sensations of the same kind and its purity, or the chance it has of not being followed by sensations of the opposite kind. Finally, it is necessary to consider the extent, or the number of people affected by the action.\nEvils of the first and second order.\nThe question then arises as to when, if at all, it might be legitimate to break the law. This is considered in \"The Theory of Legislation\", where Bentham distinguishes between evils of the first and second order. The former are more immediate consequences; the latter are consequences spread through the community causing \"alarm\" and \"danger\".\nIt is true there are cases in which, if we confine ourselves to the effects of the first order, the good will have an incontestable preponderance over the evil. Were the offence considered only under this point of view, it would not be easy to assign any good reasons to justify the rigour of the laws. Every thing depends upon the evil of the second order; it is this which gives to such actions the character of crime, and which makes punishment necessary. Let us take, for example, the physical desire of satisfying hunger. Let a beggar, pressed by hunger, steal from a rich man's house a loaf, which perhaps saves him from starving, can it be possible to compare the good which the thief acquires for himself, with the evil which the rich man suffers?... It is not on account of the evil of the first order that it is necessary to erect these actions into offences, but on account of the evil of the second order.\nJohn Stuart Mill.\nMill was brought up as a Benthamite with the explicit intention that he would carry on the cause of utilitarianism. Mill's book \"Utilitarianism\" first appeared as a series of three articles published in \"Fraser's Magazine\" in 1861 and was reprinted as a single book in 1863.\nHigher and lower pleasures.\nMill rejects a purely quantitative measurement of utility and says:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is quite compatible with the principle of utility to recognize the fact, that some kinds of pleasure are more desirable and more valuable than others. It would be absurd that while, in estimating all other things, quality is considered as well as quantity, the estimation of pleasures should be supposed to depend on quantity alone.\nThe word \"utility\" is used to mean general well-being or happiness, and Mill's view is that utility is the consequence of a good action. Utility, within the context of utilitarianism, refers to people performing actions for social utility. By social utility, he means the well-being of many people. Mill's explanation of the concept of utility in his work, Utilitarianism, is that people truly desire happiness, and since each individual desires their own happiness, it must follow that all of us desire the happiness of everyone, contributing to a larger social utility. Thus, an action that results in the greatest pleasure for the utility of society is the best action, or as Jeremy Bentham, the founder of early Utilitarianism put it, as the greatest happiness of the greatest number.\nMill not only viewed actions as a core part of utility, but as the directive rule of moral human conduct; that is, the rule is that people should only be committing actions that provide pleasure to society. This view of pleasure was hedonistic, as it pursued the thought that pleasure is the highest good in life. This concept was adopted by Bentham and can be seen in his works. According to Mill, good actions result in pleasure, and that there is no higher end than pleasure. Mill says that good actions lead to pleasure and define good character. Better put, the justification of character, and whether an action is good or not, is based on how the person contributes to the concept of social utility. In the long run the best proof of a good character is good actions; and resolutely refuse to consider any mental disposition as good, of which the predominant tendency is to produce bad conduct. In the last chapter of Utilitarianism, Mill concludes that justice, as a classifying factor of our actions (being just or unjust) is one of the certain moral requirements, and when the requirements are all regarded collectively, they are viewed as greater according to this scale of \"social utility\" as Mill puts it.\nHe also notes that, contrary to what its critics might say, there is \"no known Epicurean theory of life which does not assign to the pleasures of the intellect\u00a0... a much higher value as pleasures than to those of mere sensation.\" However, he accepts that this is usually because the intellectual pleasures are thought to have circumstantial advantages, i.e. \"greater permanency, safety, uncostliness, &amp;c.\" Instead, Mill will argue that some pleasures are intrinsically better than others.\nThe accusation that hedonism is a \"doctrine worthy only of swine\" has a long history. In \"Nicomachean Ethics\" (Book 1 Chapter 5), Aristotle says that identifying the good with pleasure is to prefer a life suitable for beasts. The theological utilitarians had the option of grounding their pursuit of happiness in the will of God; the hedonistic utilitarians needed a different defence. Mill's approach is to argue that the pleasures of the intellect are intrinsically superior to physical pleasures.\nFew human creatures would consent to be changed into any of the lower animals, for a promise of the fullest allowance of a beast's pleasures; no intelligent human being would consent to be a fool, no instructed person would be an ignoramus, no person of feeling and conscience would be selfish and base, even though they should be persuaded that the fool, the dunce, or the rascal is better satisfied with his lot than they are with theirs.\u00a0... A being of higher faculties requires more to make him happy, is capable probably of more acute suffering, and certainly accessible to it at more points, than one of an inferior type; but in spite of these liabilities, he can never really wish to sink into what he feels to be a lower grade of existence.\u00a0... It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. And if the fool, or the pig, are of a different opinion, it is because they only know their own side of the question...\nMill argues that if people who are \"competently acquainted\" with two pleasures show a decided preference for one even if it be accompanied by more discontent and \"would not resign it for any quantity of the other\", then it is legitimate to regard that pleasure as being superior in quality. Mill recognizes that these \"competent judges\" will not always agree, and states that, in cases of disagreement, the judgment of the majority is to be accepted as final. Mill also acknowledges that \"many who are capable of the higher pleasures, occasionally, under the influence of temptation, postpone them to the lower. But this is quite compatible with a full appreciation of the intrinsic superiority of the higher.\" Mill says that this appeal to those who have experienced the relevant pleasures is no different from what must happen when assessing the quantity of pleasure, for there is no other way of measuring \"the acutest of two pains, or the intensest of two pleasurable sensations.\" \"It is indisputable that the being whose capacities of enjoyment are low, has the greatest chance of having them fully satisfied; and a highly-endowed being will always feel that any happiness which he can look for, as the world is constitute, is imperfect.\"\nMill also thinks that \"intellectual pursuits have value out of proportion to the amount of contentment or pleasure (the mental state) that they produce.\" Mill also says that people should pursue these grand ideals, because if they choose to have gratification from petty pleasures, \"some displeasure will eventually creep in. We will become bored and depressed.\" Mill claims that gratification from petty pleasures only gives short-term happiness and, subsequently, worsens the individual who may feel that his life lacks happiness, since the happiness is transient. Whereas, intellectual pursuits give long-term happiness because they provide the individual with constant opportunities throughout the years to improve his life, by benefiting from accruing knowledge. Mill views intellectual pursuits as \"capable of incorporating the 'finer things' in life\" while petty pursuits do not achieve this goal. Mill is saying that intellectual pursuits give the individual the opportunity to escape the constant depression cycle since these pursuits allow them to achieve their ideals, while petty pleasures do not offer this. Although debate persists about the nature of Mill's view of gratification, this suggests bifurcation in his position.\n'Proving' the principle of utility.\nIn Chapter Four of \"Utilitarianism\", Mill considers what proof can be given for the principle of utility:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIt is usual to say that Mill is committing a number of fallacies:\nSuch allegations began to emerge in Mill's lifetime, shortly after the publication of \"Utilitarianism\", and persisted for well over a century, though the tide has been turning in recent discussions. Nonetheless, a defence of Mill against all three charges, with a chapter devoted to each, can be found in Necip Fikri Alican's \"Mill's Principle of Utility: A Defense of John Stuart Mill's Notorious Proof\" (1994). This is the first, and remains the only, book-length treatment of the subject matter. Yet the alleged fallacies in the proof continue to attract scholarly attention in journal articles and book chapters.\nHall (1949) and Popkin (1950) defend Mill against this accusation pointing out that he begins Chapter Four by asserting that \"questions of ultimate ends do not admit of proof, in the ordinary acceptation of the term\" and that this is \"common to all first principles\". Therefore, according to Hall and Popkin, Mill does not attempt to \"establish that what people do desire is desirable but merely attempts to make the principles acceptable.\" The type of \"proof\" Mill is offering \"consists only of some considerations which, Mill thought, might induce an honest and reasonable man to accept utilitarianism.\"\nHaving claimed that people do, in fact, desire happiness, Mill now has to show that it is the \"only\" thing they desire. Mill anticipates the objection that people desire other things such as virtue. He argues that whilst people might start desiring virtue as a \"means\" to happiness, eventually, it becomes part of someone's happiness and is then desired as an end in itself.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The principle of utility does not mean that any given pleasure, as music, for instance, or any given exemption from pain, as for example health, are to be looked upon as means to a collective something termed happiness, and to be desired on that account. They are desired and desirable in and for themselves; besides being means, they are a part of the end. Virtue, according to the utilitarian doctrine, is not naturally and originally part of the end, but it is capable of becoming so; and in those who love it disinterestedly it has become so, and is desired and cherished, not as a means to happiness, but as a part of their happiness.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We may give what explanation we please of this unwillingness; we may attribute it to pride, a name which is given indiscriminately to some of the most and to some of the least estimable feelings of which is mankind are capable; we may refer it to the love of liberty and personal independence, an appeal to which was with the Stoics one of the most effective means for the inculcation of it; to the love of power, or the love of excitement, both of which do really enter into and contribute to it: but its most appropriate appellation is a sense of dignity, which all humans beings possess in one form or other, and in some, though by no means in exact, proportion to their higher faculties, and which is so essential a part of the happiness of those in whom it is strong, that nothing which conflicts with it could be, otherwise than momentarily, an object of desire to them.\nHenry Sidgwick.\nSidgwick's book \"The Methods of Ethics\" has been referred to as the peak or culmination of classical utilitarianism. His main goal in this book is to ground utilitarianism in the principles of \"common-sense morality\" and thereby dispense with the doubts of his predecessors that these two are at odds with each other. For Sidgwick, ethics is about which actions are objectively right. Our knowledge of right and wrong arises from common-sense morality, which lacks a coherent principle at its core. The task of philosophy in general and ethics in particular is not so much to create new knowledge but to systematize existing knowledge. Sidgwick tries to achieve this by formulating \"methods of ethics\", which he defines as rational procedures \"for determining right conduct in any particular case\". He identifies three methods: intuitionism, which involves various independently valid moral principles to determine what ought to be done, and two forms of \"hedonism\", in which rightness only depends on the pleasure and pain following from the action. Hedonism is subdivided into \"egoistic hedonism\", which only takes the agent's own well-being into account, and \"universal hedonism\" or \"utilitarianism\", which is concerned with everyone's well-being.\nIntuitionism holds that humans have intuitive, i.e. non-inferential, knowledge of moral principles, which are self-evident to the knower. The criteria for this type of knowledge include that they are expressed in clear terms, that the different principles are mutually consistent with each other and that there is expert consensus on them. According to Sidgwick, commonsense moral principles fail to pass this test, but there are some more abstract principles that pass it, like that \"what is right for me must be right for all persons in precisely similar circumstances\" or that \"one should be equally concerned with all temporal parts of one's life\". The most general principles arrived at this way are all compatible with \"utilitarianism\", which is why Sidgwick sees a harmony between \"intuitionism\" and \"utilitarianism\". There are also less general intuitive principles, like the duty to keep one's promises or to be just, but these principles are not universal and there are cases where different duties stand in conflict with each other. Sidgwick suggests that such conflicts can be resolved in a utilitarian fashion by considering the consequences of the conflicting actions.\nThe harmony between intuitionism and utilitarianism is a partial success in Sidgwick's overall project, but he sees full success impossible since egoism, which he considers as equally rational, cannot be reconciled with utilitarianism unless \"religious assumptions\" are introduced. Such assumptions, for example, the existence of a personal God who rewards and punishes the agent in the afterlife, could reconcile egoism and utilitarianism. But without them, we have to admit a \"dualism of practical reason\" that constitutes a \"fundamental contradiction\" in our moral consciousness.\nDevelopments in the 20th century.\nIdeal utilitarianism.\nThe description of ideal utilitarianism was first used by Hastings Rashdall in \"The Theory of Good and Evil\" (1907), but it is more often associated with G. E. Moore. In \"Ethics\" (1912), Moore rejects a purely hedonistic utilitarianism and argues that there is a range of values that might be maximized. Moore's strategy was to show that it is intuitively implausible that pleasure is the sole measure of what is good. He says that such an assumption:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;involves our saying, for instance, that a world in which absolutely nothing except pleasure existed\u2014no knowledge, no love, no enjoyment of beauty, no moral qualities\u2014must yet be intrinsically better\u2014better worth creating\u2014provided only the total quantity of pleasure in it were the least bit greater, than one in which all these things existed as well as pleasure.\nIt involves our saying that, even if the total quantity of pleasure in each was exactly equal, yet the fact that all the beings in the one possessed, in addition knowledge of many different kinds and a full appreciation of all that was beautiful or worthy of love in their world, whereas none of the beings in the other possessed any of these things, would give us no reason whatever for preferring the former to the latter.\nMoore admits that it is impossible to prove the case either way, but he believed that it was intuitively obvious that even if the amount of pleasure stayed the same a world that contained such things as beauty and love would be a better world. He adds that, if a person was to take the contrary view, then \"I think it is self-evident that he would be wrong.\"\nAct and rule utilitarianism.\nIn the mid-20th century, a number of philosophers focused on the place of rules in utilitarian thought. It was already considered necessary to use rules to help choose the right action, because estimating the consequences every time seemed error-prone and unlikely to bring the best outcome. Paley had justified the use of rules and Mill says:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHowever, rule utilitarianism proposes a more central role for rules that was thought to rescue the theory from some of its more devastating criticisms, particularly problems to do with justice and promise keeping. Smart (1956) and McCloskey (1957) initially use the terms \"extreme\" and \"restricted\" utilitarianism but eventually settled on the prefixes \"act\" and \"rule\" instead. Likewise, throughout the 1950s and 1960s, articles were published both for and against the new form of utilitarianism, and through this debate the theory now known as \"rule utilitarianism\" was created. In an introduction to an anthology of these articles, the editor was able to say: \"The development of this theory was a dialectical process of formulation, criticism, reply and reformulation; the record of this process well illustrates the co-operative development of a philosophical theory.\"\nThe essential difference is in what determines whether or not an action is the right action. \"Act utilitarianism\" maintains that an action is right if it maximizes utility; \"rule utilitarianism\" maintains that an action is right if it conforms to a rule that maximizes utility.\nIn 1956, Urmson (1953) published an influential article arguing that Mill justified rules on utilitarian principles. From then on, articles have debated this interpretation of Mill. In all probability, it was not a distinction that Mill was particularly trying to make and so the evidence in his writing is inevitably mixed. A collection of Mill's writing published in 1977 includes a letter that seems to tip the balance in favour of the notion that Mill is best classified as an \"act utilitarian\". In the letter, Mill says:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I agree with you that the right way of testing actions by their consequences, is to test them by the natural consequences of the particular action, and not by those which would follow if everyone did the same. But, for the most part, the consideration of what would happen if everyone did the same, is the only means we have of discovering the tendency of the act in the particular case.\nSome school level textbooks and at least one British examination board make a further distinction between strong and weak rule utilitarianism. However, it is not clear that this distinction is made in the academic literature. It has been argued that rule utilitarianism collapses into act utilitarianism, because for any given rule, in the case where breaking the rule produces more utility, the rule can be refined by the addition of a sub-rule that handles cases like the exception. This process holds for all cases of exceptions, and so the \"rules\" have as many \"sub-rules\" as there are exceptional cases, which, in the end, makes an agent seek out whatever outcome produces the maximum utility.\nTwo-level utilitarianism.\nIn \"Principles\" (1973), R. M. Hare accepts that rule utilitarianism collapses into act utilitarianism but claims that this is a result of allowing the rules to be \"as specific and un-general as we please.\" He argues that one of the main reasons for introducing rule utilitarianism was to do justice to the general rules that people need for moral education and character development and he proposes that \"a difference between act-utilitarianism and rule-utilitarianism can be introduced by limiting the specificity of the rules, i.e., by increasing their generality.\" This distinction between a \"specific rule utilitarianism\" (which collapses into act utilitarianism) and \"general rule utilitarianism\" forms the basis of Hare's \"two-level utilitarianism\".\nWhen people \"play God or take on the role of the ideal observer\", they use the specific form, and this needs to be done when deciding what general principles to teach and follow. When people are \"inculcating\" or find themselves in situations where the biases of human nature are likely to prevent them from doing the calculations properly, then they should use the more general rule utilitarianism.\nHare argues that in practice, most of the time, people should be following the general principles:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;One ought to abide by the general principles whose general inculcation is for the best; harm is more likely to come, in actual moral situations, from questioning these rules than from sticking to them, unless the situations are very extra-ordinary; the results of sophisticated felicific calculations are not likely, human nature and human ignorance being what they are, to lead to the greatest utility.\nIn \"Moral Thinking\" (1981), Hare illustrated the two extremes. The \"archangel\" is the hypothetical person who has perfect knowledge of the situation and no personal biases or weaknesses and always uses critical moral thinking to decide the right thing to do. In contrast, the \"prole\" is the hypothetical person who is completely incapable of critical thinking and uses nothing but intuitive moral thinking and, of necessity, has to follow the general moral rules they have been taught or learned through imitation. It is not that some people are archangels and others proles, but rather that \"we all share the characteristics of both to limited and varying degrees and at different times.\"\nHare does not specify when people should think more like an \"archangel\" and more like a \"prole\" as this will, in any case, vary from person to person. However, the critical moral thinking underpins and informs the more intuitive moral thinking. It is responsible for formulating and, if necessary, reformulating the general moral rules. People also switch to critical thinking when trying to deal with unusual situations or in cases where the intuitive moral rules give conflicting advice.\nPreference utilitarianism.\nPreference utilitarianism entails promoting actions that fulfil the preferences of those beings involved. The concept of preference utilitarianism was first proposed in 1977 by John Harsanyi in \"Morality and the Theory of Rational Behaviour\", however the concept is more commonly associated with R. M. Hare, Peter Singer, and Richard Brandt.\nHarsanyi claims that his theory is indebted to:\nHarsanyi rejects hedonistic utilitarianism as being dependent on an outdated psychology saying that it is far from obvious that everything people do is motivated by a desire to maximize pleasure and minimize pain. He also rejects ideal utilitarianism because \"it is certainly not true as an empirical observation that people's only purpose in life is to have 'mental states of intrinsic worth'.\"\nAccording to Harsanyi, \"preference utilitarianism is the only form of utilitarianism consistent with the important philosophical principle of preference autonomy. By this I mean the principle that, in deciding what is good and what is bad for a given individual, the ultimate criterion can only be his own wants and his own preferences.\"\nHarsanyi adds two caveats. Firstly, people sometimes have irrational preferences. To deal with this, Harsanyi distinguishes between \"manifest\" preferences and \"true\" preferences. The former are those \"manifested by his observed behaviour, including preferences possibly based on erroneous factual beliefs, or on careless logical analysis, or on strong emotions that at the moment greatly hinder rational choice\"; whereas the latter are \"the preferences he would have if he had all the relevant factual information, always reasoned with the greatest possible care, and were in a state of mind most conducive to rational choice.\" It is the latter that preference utilitarianism tries to satisfy.\nThe second caveat is that antisocial preferences, such as sadism, envy, and resentment, have to be excluded. Harsanyi achieves this by claiming that such preferences partially exclude those people from the moral community:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNegative utilitarianism.\nIn \"The Open Society and its Enemies\" (1945), Karl Popper argues that the principle \"maximize pleasure\" should be replaced by \"minimize pain\". He believes that \"it is not only impossible but very dangerous to attempt to maximize the pleasure or the happiness of the people, since such an attempt must lead to totalitarianism.\" He claims that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[T]here is, from the ethical point of view, no symmetry between suffering and happiness, or between pain and pleasure... In my opinion human suffering makes a direct moral appeal, namely, the appeal for help, while there is no similar call to increase the happiness of a man who is doing well anyway. A further criticism of the Utilitarian formula \"Maximize pleasure\" is that it assumes a continuous pleasure-pain scale that lets us treat degrees of pain as negative degrees of pleasure. But, from the moral point of view, pain cannot be outweighed by pleasure, and especially not one man's pain by another man's pleasure. Instead of the greatest happiness for the greatest number, one should demand, more modestly, the least amount of avoidable suffering for all...\nThe actual term \"negative utilitarianism\" itself was introduced by R. N. Smart as the title to his 1958 reply to Popper in which he argues that the principle would entail seeking the quickest and least painful method of killing the entirety of humanity.\nIn response to Smart's argument, Simon Knutsson (2019) has argued that classical utilitarianism and similar consequentialist views are roughly equally likely to entail killing the entirety of humanity, as they would seem to imply that one should kill existing beings and replace them with happier beings if possible. Consequently, Knutsson argues:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurthermore, Knutsson notes that one could argue that other forms of consequentialism, such as classical utilitarianism, in some cases have less plausible implications than negative utilitarianism, such as in scenarios where classical utilitarianism implies it would be right to kill everyone and replace them in a manner that creates more suffering, but also more well-being such that the sum, on the classical utilitarian calculus, is net positive. Negative utilitarianism, in contrast, would not allow such killing.\nSome versions of negative utilitarianism include:\nSome see negative utilitarianism as a branch within modern hedonistic utilitarianism, which assigns a higher weight to the avoidance of suffering than to the promotion of happiness. The moral weight of suffering can be increased by using a \"compassionate\" utilitarian metric, so that the result is the same as in prioritarianism.\nMotive utilitarianism.\nMotive utilitarianism was first proposed by Robert Merrihew Adams in 1976. Whereas act utilitarianism requires us to choose our actions by estimating which action will maximize utility and rule utilitarianism requires us to implement rules that will, on the whole, maximize utility, \"motive utilitarianism\" \"has the utility calculus being used to select motives and dispositions according to their general felicific effects, and those motives and dispositions then dictate our choices of actions.\"\nThe arguments for moving to some form of motive utilitarianism at the personal level can be seen as mirroring the arguments for moving to some form of rule utilitarianism at the social level. Adams (1976) refers to Sidgwick's observation that \"Happiness (general as well as individual) is likely to be better attained if the extent to which we set ourselves consciously to aim at it be carefully restricted.\" Trying to apply the utility calculation on each and every occasion is likely to lead to a sub-optimal outcome. It is argued that applying carefully selected rules at the social level and encouraging appropriate motives at the personal level are likely to lead to better overall outcomes; even though on some individual occasions it leads to the wrong action when assessed according to act utilitarian standards.\nAdams concludes that \"right action, by act-utilitarian standards, and right motivation, by motive-utilitarian standards, are incompatible in some cases.\" The necessity of this conclusion is rejected by Fred Feldman who argues that \"the conflict in question results from an inadequate formulation of the utilitarian doctrines; motives play no essential role in it\u00a0... [and that]\u00a0... [p]recisely the same sort of conflict arises even when MU is left out of consideration and AU is applied by itself.\" Instead, Feldman proposes a variant of act utilitarianism that results in there being no conflict between it and motive utilitarianism.\nWealth maximization.\nAnother 20th-century offshoot of utilitarian-style thinking, often labeled wealth maximization, has its economic roots in the \"potential Pareto improvements\" advanced by Nicholas Kaldor, John Hicks, and Tibor Scitovsky. While traditional Pareto criteria require that no one be made worse off, wealth maximization\u2014closely tied to the Kaldor\u2013Hicks efficiency\u2014permits changes that increase overall economic surplus even if some parties lose, so long as the winners could in principle compensate the losers.\nIn legal scholarship, the concept was popularized by Richard Posner in \"Economic Analysis of Law\" (1973). Under this approach, a policy or rule is deemed socially desirable if it produces a net increase in aggregate \"wealth\", typically measured by willingness-to-pay for outcomes. Advocates argue that, because willingness-to-pay translates diverse preferences into comparable monetary values, wealth maximization can reconcile the problem of interpersonally adding \"utilities\". Critics counter that wealthier parties can effectively \"outbid\" poorer ones and thus skew outcomes. Supporters respond that distributional worries can be handled by taxes and transfers, leaving wealth maximization to guide efficient resource allocation in law.\nCriticisms and responses.\nBecause utilitarianism is not a single theory, but rather a cluster of related theories that have been developed over two hundred years, criticisms can be made for different reasons and have different targets.\nQuantifying utility.\nA common objection to utilitarianism is the inability to quantify, compare, or measure happiness or well-being. Rachael Briggs writes in the \"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;One objection to this interpretation of utility is that there may not be a single good (or indeed any good) which rationality requires us to seek. But if we understand \"utility\" broadly enough to include all potentially desirable ends\u2014pleasure, knowledge, friendship, health and so on\u2014it's not clear that there is a unique correct way to make the tradeoffs between different goods so that each outcome receives a utility. There may be no good answer to the question of whether the life of an ascetic monk contains more or less good than the life of a happy libertine\u2014but assigning utilities to these options forces us to compare them.\nUtility understood this way is a personal preference, in the absence of any objective measurement.\nUtility ignores justice.\nAs Rosen (2003) has pointed out, claiming that act utilitarians are not concerned about having rules is to set up a \"straw man\". Similarly, R.M. Hare refers to \"the crude caricature of act utilitarianism which is the only version of it that many philosophers seem to be acquainted with.\" Given what Bentham says about second order evils, it would be a serious misrepresentation to say that he and similar act utilitarians would be prepared to punish an innocent person for the greater good. Nevertheless, whether they would agree or not, this is what critics of utilitarianism claim is entailed by the theory.\n\"Sheriff scenario\".\nA classic version of this criticism was given by H. J. McCloskey in his 1957 \"sheriff scenario\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Suppose that a sheriff were faced with the choice either of framing a Negro for a rape that had aroused hostility to the Negroes (a particular Negro generally being believed to be guilty but whom the sheriff knows not to be guilty)\u2014and thus preventing serious anti-Negro riots which would probably lead to some loss of life and increased hatred of each other by whites and Negroes\u2014or of hunting for the guilty person and thereby allowing the anti-Negro riots to occur, while doing the best he can to combat them. In such a case the sheriff, if he were an extreme utilitarian, would appear to be committed to framing the Negro.\nBy \"extreme\" utilitarian, McCloskey is referring to what later came to be called act utilitarianism. He suggests one response might be that the sheriff would not frame the innocent negro because of another rule: \"do not punish an innocent person\". Another response might be that the riots the sheriff is trying to avoid might have positive utility in the long run by drawing attention to questions of race and resources to help address tensions between the communities. In a later article, McCloskey says:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Surely the utilitarian must admit that whatever the facts of the matter may be, it is logically possible that an 'unjust' system of punishment\u2014e.g. a system involving collective punishments, retroactive laws and punishments, or punishments of parents and relations of the offender\u2014may be more useful than a 'just' system of punishment?\n\"The Brothers Karamazov\".\nAn older form of this argument was presented by Fyodor Dostoyevsky in his book \"The Brothers Karamazov\", in which Ivan challenges his brother Alyosha to answer his question: Tell me straight out, I call on you\u2014answer me: imagine that you yourself are building the edifice of human destiny with the object of making people happy in the finale, of giving them peace and rest at last, but for that you must inevitably and unavoidably torture just one tiny creature, [one child], and raise your edifice on the foundation of her unrequited tears\u2014would you agree to be the architect on such conditions?\u00a0... And can you admit the idea that the people for whom you are building would agree to accept their happiness on the unjustified blood of a tortured child, and having accepted it, to remain forever happy?This scenario was illustrated in more depth in 1973 by Ursula K. Le Guin in the celebrated short story \"The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas.\"\nPredicting consequences.\nSome argue that it is impossible to do the calculation that utilitarianism requires because consequences are inherently unknowable. Daniel Dennett describes this as the \"Three Mile Island effect\". Dennett points out that not only is it impossible to assign a precise utility value to the incident, it is impossible to know whether, ultimately, the near-meltdown that occurred was a good or bad thing. He suggests that it would have been a good thing if plant operators learned lessons that prevented future serious incidents.\nRussell Hardin (1990) rejects such arguments. He argues that it is possible to distinguish the moral impulse of utilitarianism (which is \"to define the right as good consequences and to motivate people to achieve these\") from our ability to correctly apply rational principles that, among other things, \"depend on the perceived facts of the case and on the particular moral actor's mental equipment.\" The fact that the latter is limited and can change does not mean that the former has to be rejected. \"If we develop a better system for determining relevant causal relations so that we are able to choose actions that better produce our intended ends, it does not follow that we then must change our ethics. The moral impulse of utilitarianism is constant, but our decisions under it are contingent on our knowledge and scientific understanding.\"\nFrom the beginning, utilitarianism has recognized that certainty in such matters is unobtainable and both Bentham and Mill said that it was necessary to rely on the \"tendencies\" of actions to bring about consequences. G. E. Moore, writing in 1903, said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDemandingness objection.\nAct utilitarianism not only requires everyone to do what they can to maximize utility, but to do so without any favouritism. Mill said, \"As between his own happiness and that of others, utilitarianism requires him to be as strictly impartial as a disinterested and benevolent spectator.\" Critics say that this combination of requirements leads to utilitarianism making unreasonable demands. The well-being of strangers counts just as much as that of friends, family or self. \"What makes this requirement so demanding is the gargantuan number of strangers in great need of help and the indefinitely many opportunities to make sacrifices to help them.\" As Shelly Kagan says, \"Given the parameters of the actual world, there is no question that\u00a0... (maximally)\u00a0... promoting the good would require a life of hardship, self-denial, and austerity\u00a0... a life spent promoting the good would be a severe one indeed.\"\nHooker (2002) describes two aspects to the problem: act utilitarianism requires \"huge\" sacrifices from those who are relatively better off and also requires sacrifice of your own good even when the aggregate good will be only \"slightly\" increased. Another way of highlighting the complaint is to say that in utilitarianism, \"there is no such thing as morally permissible self-sacrifice that goes above and beyond the call of duty.\" Mill was quite clear about this, \"A sacrifice which does not increase, or tend to increase, the sum total of happiness, it considers as wasted.\"\nOne response to the problem is to accept its demands. This is the view taken by Peter Singer, who says:No doubt we do instinctively prefer to help those who are close to us. Few could stand by and watch a child drown; many can ignore the avoidable deaths of children in Africa or India. The question, however, is not what we usually do, but what we ought to do, and it is difficult to see any sound moral justification for the view that distance, or community membership, makes a crucial difference to our obligations.Others argue that a moral theory that is so contrary to our deeply held moral convictions must either be rejected or modified. There have been various attempts to modify utilitarianism to escape its seemingly over-demanding requirements. One approach is to drop the demand that utility be maximized. In \"Satisficing Consequentialism\", Michael Slote argues for a form of utilitarianism where \"an act might qualify as morally right through having good enough consequences, even though better consequences could have been produced.\" One advantage of such a system is that it would be able to accommodate the notion of supererogatory actions.\nSamuel Scheffler takes a different approach and amends the requirement that everyone be treated the same. In particular, Scheffler suggests that there is an \"agent-centered prerogative\" such that when the overall utility is being calculated, it is permitted to count our own interests more heavily than the interests of others. Kagan suggests that such a procedure might be justified on the grounds that \"a general requirement to promote the good would lack the motivational underpinning necessary for genuine moral requirements\" and, secondly, that personal independence is necessary for the existence of commitments and close personal relations and that \"the value of such commitments yields a positive reason for preserving within moral theory at least some moral independence for the personal point of view.\"\nRobert Goodin takes yet another approach and argues that the demandingness objection can be \"blunted\" by treating utilitarianism as a guide to public policy rather than one of individual morality. He suggests that many of the problems arise under the traditional formulation because the conscientious utilitarian ends up having to make up for the failings of others and so contributing more than their fair share.\nGandjour specifically considers market situations and analyses whether individuals who act in markets may produce a utilitarian optimum. He lists several demanding conditions that need to be satisfied: individuals need to display instrumental rationality, markets need to be perfectly competitive, and income and goods need to be redistributed.\nHarsanyi argues that the objection overlooks the fact that \"people attach considerable utility to freedom from unduly burdensome moral obligations\u00a0... most people will prefer a society with a more relaxed moral code, and will feel that such a society will achieve a higher level of average utility\u2014even if adoption of such a moral code should lead to some losses in economic and cultural accomplishments (so long as these losses remain within tolerable limits). This means that utilitarianism, if correctly interpreted, will yield a moral code with a standard of acceptable conduct very much below the level of highest moral perfection, leaving plenty of scope for supererogatory actions exceeding this minimum standard.\"\nAggregating utility.\nThe objection that \"utilitarianism does not take seriously the distinction between persons\" came to prominence in 1971 with the publication of John Rawls' \"A Theory of Justice\". The concept is also important in animal rights advocate Richard Ryder's rejection of utilitarianism, in which he talks of the \"boundary of the individual\", through which neither pain nor pleasure may pass.\nHowever, a similar objection was noted in 1970 by Thomas Nagel, who claimed that consequentialism \"treats the desires, needs, satisfactions, and dissatisfactions of distinct persons as if they were the desires, etc., of a mass person;\" and even earlier by David Gauthier, who wrote that utilitarianism supposes that \"mankind is a super-person, whose greatest satisfaction is the objective of moral action.\u00a0... But this is absurd. Individuals have wants, not mankind; individuals seek satisfaction, not mankind. A person's satisfaction is not part of any greater satisfaction.\" Thus, the aggregation of utility becomes futile as both pain and happiness are intrinsic to and inseparable from the consciousness in which they are felt, rendering impossible the task of adding up the various pleasures of multiple individuals.\nA response to this criticism is to point out that whilst seeming to resolve some problems it introduces others. Intuitively, there are many cases where people do want to take the numbers involved into account. As Alastair Norcross has said:[S]uppose that Homer is faced with the painful choice between saving Barney from a burning building or saving both Moe and Apu from the building\u00a0... it is clearly better for Homer to save the larger number, precisely because it is a larger number.\u00a0... Can anyone who really considers the matter seriously honestly claim to believe that it is worse that one person die than that the entire sentient population of the universe be severely mutilated? Clearly not.It may be possible to uphold the distinction between persons whilst still aggregating utility, if it accepted that people can be influenced by empathy. This position is advocated by Iain King, who has suggested the evolutionary basis of empathy means humans can take into account the interests of other individuals, but only on a one-to-one basis, \"since we can only imagine ourselves in the mind of one other person at a time.\" King uses this insight to adapt utilitarianism, and it may help reconcile Bentham's philosophy with deontology and virtue ethics.\nPhilosopher John Taurek also argued that the idea of adding happiness or pleasures across persons is quite unintelligible and that the numbers of persons involved in a situation are morally irrelevant. Taurek's basic concern comes down to this: people cannot explain what it means to say that things would be five times worse if five people die than if one person dies. \"I cannot give a satisfactory account of the meaning of judgments of this kind\", he wrote (p.\u00a0304). He argues that each person can only lose one person's happiness or pleasures. There is not five times more loss of happiness or pleasure when five die: who would be feeling this happiness or pleasure? \"Each person's potential loss has the same significance to me, only as a loss to that person alone. because, by hypothesis, I have an equal concern for each person involved, I am moved to give each of them an equal chance to be spared his loss\" (p.\u00a0307). Derek Parfit (1978) and others have criticized Taurek's line, and it continues to be discussed.\nCalculation time.\nAn early criticism, which was addressed by Mill, is that if time is taken to calculate the best course of action it is likely that the opportunity to take the best course of action will already have passed. Mill responded that there had been ample time to estimate the likely effects:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[N]amely, the whole past duration of the human species. During all that time, mankind have been learning by experience the tendencies of actions; on which experience all the prudence, as well as all the morality of life, are dependent...It is a strange notion that the acknowledgment of a first principle is inconsistent with the admission of secondary ones. To inform a traveller respecting the place of his ultimate destination, is not to forbid the use of landmarks and direction-posts on the way. The proposition that happiness is the end and aim of morality, does not mean that no road ought to be laid down to that goal, or that persons going thither should not be advised to take one direction rather than another. Men really ought to leave off talking a kind of nonsense on this subject, which they would neither talk nor listen to on other matters of practical concernment.\nMore recently, Hardin has made the same point. \"It should embarrass philosophers that they have ever taken this objection seriously. Parallel considerations in other realms are dismissed with eminently good sense. Lord Devlin notes, 'if the reasonable man \"worked to rule\" by perusing to the point of comprehension every form he was handed, the commercial and administrative life of the country would creep to a standstill.'\"\nIt is such considerations that lead even act utilitarians to rely on \"rules of thumb\", as Smart (1973) has called them.\nSpecial obligations criticism.\nOne of the oldest criticisms of utilitarianism is that it ignores special obligations. Classical utilitarianism does not attribute special weights to relatives. The first to address this was an early utilitarian and friend of Jeremy Bentham named William Godwin, who held in his work \"Enquiry Concerning Political Justice\" that such personal needs should be disregarded in favour of the greatest good for the greatest number of people. Applying the utilitarian principle \"that life ought to be preferred which will be most conducive to the general good\" to the choice of saving one of two people, either \"the illustrious Archbishop of Cambray\" or his chambermaid, he wrote: Supposing the chambermaid had been my wife, my mother or my benefactor. That would not alter the truth of the proposition. The life of [the Archbishop] would still be more valuable than that of the chambermaid; and justice, pure, unadulterated justice, would still have preferred that which was most valuable.\nCriticisms of utilitarian value theory.\nUtilitarianism's assertion that well-being is the only thing with intrinsic moral value has been attacked by various critics. Thomas Carlyle derided \"Benthamee Utility, virtue by Profit and Loss; reducing this God's-world to a dead brute Steam-engine, the infinite celestial Soul of Man to a kind of Hay-balance for weighing hay and thistles on, pleasures and pains on\". Karl Marx, in \"Das Kapital\", criticises Bentham's utilitarianism on the grounds that it does not appear to recognise that people have different joys in different socioeconomic contexts:\nWith the driest naivete he takes the modern shopkeeper, especially the English shopkeeper, as the normal man. Whatever is useful to this queer normal man, and to his world, is absolutely useful. This yard-measure, then, he applies to past, present, and future. The Christian religion, e.g., is \"useful,\" \"because it forbids in the name of religion the same faults that the penal code condemns in the name of the law.\" Artistic criticism is \"harmful,\" because it disturbs worthy people in their enjoyment of Martin Tupper, etc. With such rubbish has the brave fellow, with his motto, \"nulla dies sine linea [no day without a line]\", piled up mountains of books.\nPope John Paul II, following his personalist philosophy, argued that a danger of utilitarianism is that it tends to make persons, just as much as things, the object of use. \"Utilitarianism\", he wrote, \"is a civilization of production and of use, a civilization of things and not of persons, a civilization in which persons are used in the same way as things are used.\"\nDuty-based criticisms.\nW. D. Ross, speaking from the perspective of his deontological pluralism, acknowledges that there is a duty to promote the maximum of aggregate good, as utilitarianism demands. But, Ross contends, this is just one besides various other duties, like the duty to keep one's promises or to make amends for wrongful acts, which are ignored by the simplistic and reductive utilitarian outlook.\nRoger Scruton was a deontologist, and believed that utilitarianism did not give duty the place that it needed inside our ethical judgements. He asked us to consider the dilemma of Anna Karenina, who had to choose between her love of Vronsky and her duty towards her husband and her son. Scruton wrote, \"Suppose Anna were to reason that it is better to satisfy two healthy young people and frustrate one old one than to satisfy one old person and frustrate two young ones, by a factor of 2.5 to 1: ergo I am leaving. What would we think, then, of her moral seriousness?\"\nAdditional considerations.\nAverage versus total happiness.\nIn \"The Methods of Ethics\", Henry Sidgwick asked, \"Is it total or average happiness that we seek to make a maximum?\" Paley notes that, although he speaks of the happiness of communities, \"the happiness of a people is made up of the happiness of single persons; and the quantity of happiness can only be augmented by increasing the number of the percipients, or the pleasure of their perceptions\" and that if extreme cases, such as people held as slaves, are excluded the amount of happiness will usually be in proportion to the number of people. Consequently, \"the decay of population is the greatest evil that a state can suffer; and the improvement of it the object which ought, in all countries, to be aimed at in preference to every other political purpose whatsoever.\" A similar view was expressed by Smart, who argued that, all other things being equal, a universe with two million happy people is better than a universe with only one million happy people.\nAccording to Derek Parfit, using total happiness falls victim to the repugnant conclusion, whereby large numbers of people with very low but non-negative utility values can be seen as a better goal than a population of a less extreme size living in comfort. In other words, according to the theory, it is a moral good to breed more people on the world for as long as total happiness rises. William Shaw suggests that the problem raised by Parfit can be avoided if a distinction is made between potential people, who need not concern us, and actual future people, who should concern us. He says, \"utilitarianism values the happiness of people, not the production of units of happiness. Accordingly, one has no positive obligation to have children. However, if you have decided to have a child, then you have an obligation to give birth to the happiest child you can.\"\nOn the other hand, measuring the utility of a population based on the average utility of that population avoids Parfit's repugnant conclusion but causes other problems. For example, bringing a moderately happy person into a very happy world would be seen as an immoral act; aside from this, the theory implies that it would be a moral good to eliminate all people whose happiness is below average, as this would raise the average happiness. Additionally, the calculations made based on average utility implausibly judge a crowded hell to be better than less crowded one. According to the principle of average utility, a group of people being brutally tortured would be made better off by the addition of more people who are tortured slightly less.\nMotives, intentions, and actions.\nUtilitarianism is typically taken to assess the rightness or wrongness of an action by considering just the consequences of that action. Bentham very carefully distinguishes motive from intention and says that motives are not in themselves good or bad but can be referred to as such on account of their tendency to produce pleasure or pain. He adds that, \"from every kind of motive, may proceed actions that are good, others that are bad, and others that are indifferent.\" Mill makes a similar point and explicitly says that \"motive has nothing to do with the morality of the action, though much with the worth of the agent. He who saves a fellow creature from drowning does what is morally right, whether his motive be duty, or the hope of being paid for his trouble.\"\nHowever, with intention the situation is more complex. In a footnote printed in the second edition of \"Utilitarianism\", Mill says: \"the morality of the action depends entirely upon the intention\u2014that is, upon what the agent wills to do.\" Elsewhere, he says, \"Intention, and motive, are two very different things. But it is the intention, that is, the foresight of consequences, which constitutes the moral rightness or wrongness of the act.\"\nThe correct interpretation of Mill's footnote is a matter of some debate. The difficulty in interpretation centres around trying to explain why, since it is consequences that matter, intentions should play a role in the assessment of the morality of an action but motives should not. One possibility \"involves supposing that the 'morality' of the act is one thing, probably to do with the praiseworthiness or blameworthiness of the agent, and its rightness or wrongness another.\" Jonathan Dancy rejects this interpretation on the grounds that Mill is explicitly making intention relevant to an assessment of the act not to an assessment of the agent.\nAn interpretation given by Roger Crisp draws on a definition given by Mill in \"A System of Logic\", where he says that an \"intention to produce the effect, is one thing; the effect produced in consequence of the intention, is another thing; the two together constitute the action.\" Accordingly, whilst two actions may outwardly appear to be the same they will be different actions if there is a different intention. Dancy notes that this does not explain why intentions count but motives do not.\nA third interpretation is that an action might be considered a complex action consisting of several stages and it is the intention that determines which of these stages are to be considered part of the action. Although this is the interpretation favoured by Dancy, he recognizes that this might not have been Mill's own view, for Mill \"would not even allow that 'p &amp; q' expresses a complex proposition. He wrote in his \"System of Logic\" I iv. 3, of 'Caesar is dead and Brutus is alive', that 'we might as well call a street a complex house, as these two propositions a complex proposition'.\"\nFinally, whilst motives may not play a role in determining the morality of an action, this does not preclude utilitarians from fostering particular motives if doing so will increase overall happiness.\nOther sentient beings.\nIn \"An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation\", Bentham wrote \"the question is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?\" Mill's distinction between higher and lower pleasures might suggest that he gave more status to humans. However, in his essay \"Whewell on Moral Philosophy\", Mill defends Bentham's position, calling it a \"noble anticipation\", and writing: \"Granted that any practice causes more pain to animals than it gives pleasure to man; is that practice moral or immoral? And if, exactly in proportion as human beings raise their heads out of the slough of selfishness, they do not with one voice answer 'immoral', let the morality of the principle of utility be for ever condemned.\"\nHenry Sidgwick also considers the implications of utilitarianism for nonhuman animals. He writes:\"We have next to consider who the 'all' are, whose happiness is to be taken into account. Are we to extend our concern to all the beings capable of pleasure and pain whose feelings are affected by our conduct? or are we to confine our view to human happiness? The former view is the one adopted by Bentham and Mill, and (I believe) by the Utilitarian school generally: and is obviously most in accordance with the universality that is characteristic of their principle\u00a0... it seems arbitrary and unreasonable to exclude from the end, as so conceived, any pleasure of any sentient being.\"Among contemporary utilitarian philosophers, Peter Singer is especially known for arguing that the well-being of all sentient beings ought to be given equal consideration. Singer suggests that rights are conferred according to the level of a creature's sentience, regardless of their species. He adds that humans tend to be speciesist (discriminatory against non-humans) in ethical matters, and argues that, in utilitarianism, speciesism cannot be justified as there is no rational distinction that can be made between the suffering of humans and the suffering of nonhuman animals; all suffering ought to be reduced. Singer writes: \"The racist violates the principle of equality by giving greater weight to the interests of members of his own race, when there is a clash between their interests and the interests of those of another race. Similarly the speciesist allows the interests of his own species to override the greater interests of members of other species. The pattern is the same in each case\u00a0... Most human beings are speciesists.\"\nIn John Stuart Mill's essay \"On Nature\" he argues that the welfare of wild animals is to be considered when making utilitarian judgments. Tyler Cowen argues that, if individual animals are carriers of utility, then the predatory activity of carnivores should be limited relative to their victims: \"At the very least, we should limit current subsidies to nature's carnivores.\"\nThis view still might be contrasted with deep ecology, which holds that an intrinsic value is attached to all forms of life and nature, whether currently assumed to be sentient or not. According to utilitarianism, the forms of life that are unable to experience anything akin to either enjoyment or discomfort are denied moral status, because it is impossible to increase the happiness or reduce the suffering of something that cannot feel happiness or suffer. Singer writes:\nThe capacity for suffering and enjoying things is a prerequisite for having interests at all, a condition that must be satisfied before we can speak of interests in any meaningful way. It would be nonsense to say that it was not in the interests of a stone to be kicked along the road by a schoolboy. A stone does not have interests because it cannot suffer. Nothing that we can do to it could possibly make any difference to its welfare. A mouse, on the other hand, does have an interest in not being tormented, because it will suffer if it is. If a being suffers, there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration. No matter what the nature of the being, the principle of equality requires that its suffering be counted equally with the like suffering\u2014in so far as rough comparisons can be made\u2014of any other being. If a being is not capable of suffering, or of experiencing enjoyment or happiness, there is nothing to be taken into account.\nThus, the moral value of one-celled organisms, as well as some multi-cellular organisms, and natural entities like a river, is only in the benefit they provide to sentient beings. Similarly, utilitarianism places no direct intrinsic value on biodiversity, although the benefits that biodiversity brings to sentient beings may mean that, in utilitarianism, biodiversity ought to be maintained in general.\nDigital minds.\nNick Bostrom and Carl Shulman consider that, as advancements in artificial intelligence continue, it will probably be possible to engineer digital minds that require less resources and have a much higher rate and intensity of subjective experience than humans. These \"super-beneficiaries\" could also be unaffected by hedonic adaptation. Nick Bostrom said that people should find \"paths that will enable digital minds and biological minds to coexist, in a mutually beneficial way where all of these different forms can flourish and thrive\".\nApplication to specific problems.\nThe concept has been applied towards social welfare economics, questions of justice, the crisis of global poverty, the ethics of raising animals for food, and the importance of avoiding existential risks to humanity. In the context of lying, some utilitarians support white lies.\nWorld poverty.\nAn article in the \"American Economic Journal\" has addressed the issue of Utilitarian ethics within redistribution of wealth. The journal stated that taxation of the wealthy is the best way to make use of the disposable income they receive. This says that the money creates utility for the most people by funding government services. Many utilitarian philosophers, including Peter Singer and Toby Ord, argue that inhabitants of developed countries in particular have an obligation to help to end extreme poverty across the world, for example by regularly donating some of their income to charity. Peter Singer, for example, argues that donating some of one's income to charity could help save a life or cure somebody from a poverty-related illness, which is a much better use of the money as it brings someone in extreme poverty far more happiness than it would bring to oneself if one lived in relative comfort. However, Singer not only argues that one ought to donate a significant proportion of one's income to charity, but also that this money should be directed to the most cost-effective charities, in order to bring about the greatest good for the greatest number, consistent with utilitarian thinking. Singer's ideas have formed the basis of the modern effective altruism movement.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

One of nine colonial colleges, it was chartered in 1755 through the efforts of founder and first president Benjamin Franklin, who had advocated for an educational institution that trained leaders in academia, commerce, and public service. \nThe university has four undergraduate schools and 12 graduate and professional schools. Schools enrolling undergraduates include the College of Arts and Sciences, the School of Engineering and Applied Science, the Wharton School, and the School of Nursing. Among its graduate schools are its law school, whose first professor, James Wilson, helped write the U.S. Constitution; and its medical school, the first in North America.\nIn 2023, Penn ranked third among U.S. universities in research expenditures, according to the National Science Foundation. As of 2025, its endowment was $, making it the sixth-wealthiest private academic institution in the nation. The University of Pennsylvania's main campus is in the University City neighborhood of West Philadelphia, and is centered around College Hall. Campus landmarks include Houston Hall, the first modern student union; and Franklin Field, the nation's first dual-level college football stadium and the nation's longest-standing NCAA Division I college football stadium in continuous operation. The university's athletics program, the Penn Quakers, fields varsity teams in 33 sports as a member of NCAA Division I's Ivy League conference.\nPenn alumni, trustees, and faculty include 8 Founding Fathers of the United States who signed the Declaration of Independence, 7 who signed the U.S. Constitution, 24 members of the Continental Congress, 3 presidents of the United States, 38 Nobel laureates, 9 foreign heads of state, 3 United States Supreme Court justices, at least 4 Supreme Court justices of foreign nations, 32 U.S. senators, 163 members of the U.S. House of Representatives, 19 U.S. Cabinet secretaries, 46 governors, 28 State Supreme Court justices, 36 living undergraduate billionaires (the largest number of any U.S. college or university), and 5 Medal of Honor recipients.\nHistory.\nIn 1740, a group of Philadelphians organized to erect a great preaching hall for George Whitefield, a traveling Anglican evangelist, which was designed and constructed by Edmund Woolley. It was the largest building in Philadelphia at the time, and thousands of people attended it to hear Whitefield preach.\nIn the fall of 1749, Benjamin Franklin, a Founding Father and polymath in Philadelphia, circulated a pamphlet, \",\" his vision for what he called a \"Public Academy of Philadelphia\".\nOn June 16, 1755, the College of Philadelphia was chartered, paving the way for the addition of undergraduate instruction. \nPenn identifies as the fourth-oldest institution of higher education in the United States, though this representation is challenged by Princeton and Columbia since the College of Philadelphia was not chartered or commence classes until 1755 and the first board of trustees was not convened until 1749, arguably making it the sixth or fifth-oldest.\nCampus.\nThe University of Pennsylvania's campus spans approximately 299 acres in West Philadelphia, featuring a blend of historic and modern architecture. Key facilities include the Perelman Center for Advanced Medicine, the Penn Museum, and the recently constructed Pennovation Center, which serves as a hub for innovation and entrepreneurship. \nMuch of the current architecture on Penn's campus was designed by the Philadelphia-based architecture firm Cope and Stewardson, whose owners were Philadelphia born and raised architects and Penn professors who also designed Princeton University and a large part of Washington University in St. Louis. They were known for having combined the Gothic architecture of the University of Oxford and University of Cambridge with the local landscape to establish the Collegiate Gothic style.\nPenn's main artery at the center of Penn's Campus Historic District is Locust Walk, a pedestrian only walkway first announced by Penn President, Harold Stassen in 1948. Work began in the summer of 1960, and was completed in 1972.\nThe present core campus covers over in a contiguous area of West Philadelphia's University City section, and the older heart of the campus comprises the University of Pennsylvania Campus Historic District. All of Penn's schools and most of its research institutes are located on this campus. The surrounding neighborhood includes several restaurants, bars, a large upscale grocery store, and a movie theater on the western edge of campus. Penn's core campus borders Drexel University and is a few blocks from the University City campus of Saint Joseph's University, which absorbed University of the Sciences in Philadelphia in a merger, and The Restaurant School at Walnut Hill College.\nWistar Institute, a cancer research center, is also located on Penn's campus. In 2014, a new seven-story glass and steel building was completed next to the institute's original brick edifice built in 1897 further expanding collaboration between the university and the Wistar Institute.\nThe Module 6 Utility Plant and Garage at Penn was designed by BLT Architects and completed in 1995. Module 6 is located at 38th and Walnut and includes spaces for 627 vehicles, of storefront retail operations, a 9,500-ton chiller module and corresponding extension of the campus chilled water loop, and a 4,000-ton ice storage facility.\nIn 2010, in its first significant expansion across the Schuylkill River, Penn purchased at the northwest corner of 34th Street and Grays Ferry Avenue, the then site of DuPont's Marshall Research Labs. In October 2016, with help from architects Matthias Hollwich, Marc Kushner, and KSS Architects, Penn completed the design and renovation of the center piece of the project, a former paint factory named \"Pennovation Works\", which houses shared desks, wet labs, common areas, a pitch bleacher, and other attributes of a tech incubator. The rest of the site, known as South Bank, is a mixture of lightly refurbished industrial buildings that serve as affordable and flexible workspaces and land for future development.\nParks and arboreta.\nIn 2007, Penn acquired about between the campus and the Schuylkill River at the former site of the Philadelphia Civic Center and a nearby site then owned by the United States Postal Service. Dubbed the Postal Lands, the site extends from Market Street on the north to Penn's Bower Field on the south, including the former main regional U.S. Postal Building at 30th and Market Streets, now the regional office for the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. Over the next decade, the site became the home to educational, research, biomedical, and mixed-use facilities. The first phase, comprising a park and athletic facilities, opened in the fall of 2011.\nIn September 2011, Penn completed the construction of the $, Penn Park, which features passive and active recreation and athletic components framed and subdivided by canopy trees, lawns, and meadows. It is located east of the Highline Green and stretches from Walnut to South Streets.\nPenn maintains two arboreta. The first, the roughly Penn Campus Arboretum at the University of Pennsylvania, encompasses the entire University City main campus. The campus arboretum is an urban forest with over 6,500 trees representing 240 species of trees and shrubs, ten specialty gardens, and five urban parks, which has been designated as a Tree Campus USA since 2009 and formally recognized as an accredited ArbNet Arboretum since 2017. Penn maintains an interactive website linked to Penn's comprehensive tree inventory, which allows users to explore Penn's entire collection of trees. The 92-acre second arboretum Morris Arboretum is the official arboretum of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and includes more than 13,000 labelled plants of 2,500 types, representing the temperate floras of North America, Asia, and Europe, with a primary focus on Asia.\nNew Bolton Center.\nPenn also owns the New Bolton Center, the research and large-animal health care center of its veterinary school. Located near Kennett Square, New Bolton Center received nationwide media attention when Kentucky Derby winner Barbaro underwent surgery at its Widener Hospital for injuries suffered while running in the Preakness Stakes.\nLibraries.\nPenn library system has grown into a system with 300 full-time equivalent (FTE) employees, and a total operating budget of more than $. The library system has 6.19 million book and serial volumes as well as 4.23 million microform items and 1.11 million e-books. It subscribes to over 68,000 print serials and e-journals.\nThe university has 19 libraries. Van Pelt Library on the Penn campus is the university's main library. The other 18 include:\nPenn also maintains books and records off campus at their high-density storage facility.\nThe Penn Design School's Fine Arts Library was built to be Penn's main library and the first with its own building. The main library at the time was designed by Frank Furness to be first library in nation to separate the low ceilings of the library stack, where the books were stored, from forty-foot-plus high ceilinged rooms, where the books were read and studied.\nThe Yarnall Library of Theology, a major American rare book collection, is part of Penn's libraries. The Yarnall Library of Theology was formerly affiliated with St. Clement's Church in Philadelphia. It was founded in 1911 under the terms of the wills of Ellis Hornor Yarnall (1839\u20131907) and Emily Yarnall, and subsequently housed at the former Philadelphia Divinity School. The library's major areas of focus are theology, patristics, and the liturgy, history and theology of the Anglican Communion and the Episcopal Church in the United States of America. It includes a large number of rare books, incunabula, and illuminated manuscripts, and new material continues to be added.\nArt installations.\nThe campus has more than 40 notable art installations, in part because of a 1959 Philadelphia ordinance requiring total budget for new construction or major renovation projects in which governmental resources are used to include 1% for art to be used to pay for installation of site-specific public art, in part because many alumni collected and donated art to Penn, and in part because of the presence of the University of Pennsylvania School of Design on the campus.\nAlexander Archipenko's sculpture of King Solomon was initially loaned to Penn in 1985 by parents of a Penn student and donated in 1995 to honor the inauguration of Judith Rodin as Penn president in 1994.\nIn 2020, Penn installed \"Brick House\", a monumental work of art, created by Simone Leigh at the College Green gateway to Penn's campus near the corner of 34th Street and Woodland Walk. This bronze sculpture, which is high and in diameter at its base, depicts an African woman's head crowned with an afro framed by cornrow braids atop a form that resembles both a skirt and a clay house. At the installation, Penn president Amy Guttman proclaimed that \"Ms. Leigh's sculpture brings a striking presence of strength, grace, and beauty\u2014along with an ineffable sense of mystery and resilience\u2014to a central crossroad of Penn's campus.\"\nThe \"Covenant\", known to the student body as \"Dueling Tampons\" or \"The Tampons\", is a large red structure created by Alexander Liberman and located on Locust Walk as a gateway to the high-rise residences \"super block\". It was installed in 1975 and is made of rolled sheets of milled steel.\nA white button, known as The Button and officially called the Split Button is a modern art sculpture designed by designed by Swedish sculptor Claes Oldenburg (who specialized in creating oversize sculptures of everyday objects). It sits at the south entrance of Van Pelt Library and has button holes large enough for people to stand inside. Penn also has a replica of the \"Love\" sculpture, part of a series created by Robert Indiana. It is a painted aluminum sculpture and was installed in 1998 overlooking College Green.\nIn 2019, the Association for Public Art loaned Penn two multi-ton sculptures. The works are \"Social Consciousness\", created by Sir Jacob Epstein in 1954, and \"Atmosphere and Environment XII\", created by Louise Nevelson in 1970. Until the loan, both works had been located at the West Entrance to the Philadelphia Art Museum, the older since its creation and the Nevelson work since 1973. \"Social Consciousness\" was relocated to the walkway between Wharton's Lippincott Library and Phi Phi chapter of Alpha Chi Rho fraternity house, and \"Atmosphere and Environment XII\" is sited on Shoemaker Green between Franklin Field and Ringe Squash Courts.\nIn addition to the contemporary art, Penn also has several traditional statues, including a good number created by Penn's first Director of Physical Education Department, R. Tait McKenzie. Among the notable sculptures is that of \"Young Ben Franklin\", which McKenzie produced and Penn sited adjacent to the fieldhouse contiguous to Franklin Field. The sculpture is titled \"Benjamin Franklin in 1723\" and was created by McKenzie during the pre-World War I era (1910\u20131914). \nOther sculptures he produced for Penn include the 1924 sculpture of then Penn provost Edgar Fahs Smith.\nPenn is presently reevaluating all of its public art and has formed a working group led by Penn Design dean Frederick Steiner, who was part of a similar effort at the University of Texas at Austin that led to the removal of statues of Jefferson Davis and other Confederate officials, and Penn's Chief Diversity Officer, Joann Mitchell. Penn has begun the process of adding art and removing or relocating art. Penn removed from campus in 2020 the statue of the Reverend George Whitefield (who had inspired the 1740 establishment of a trust to establish a charity school, which trust Penn legally assumed in 1749) when research showed Whitefield owned fifty enslaved people and drafted and advocated for the key theological arguments in favor of slavery in Georgia and the rest of the Thirteen Colonies.\nPenn Museum.\nSince the founding of Penn Museum in 1887, it has taken part in 400 research projects worldwide. The museum's first project was an excavation of Nippur, a location in present-day Iraq.\nPenn Museum is home to the largest authentic sphinx in North America, which is about seven feet high, four feet wide, 13 feet long, 12.9 tons, and made of solid red granite.\nThe sphinx was discovered in 1912 by the British archeologist, Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie, during an excavation of the ancient Egyptian city of Memphis, Egypt, where the sphinx had guarded a temple to ward off evil. Since Petri's expedition was partially financed by Penn Petrie offered it to Penn, which arranged for it to be moved to museum in 1913. The sphinx was moved in 2019 to a more prominent spot intended to attract visitors.\nThe museum has three gallery floors with artifacts from Egypt, the Middle East, Mesoamerica, Asia, the Mediterranean, Africa and indigenous artifacts of the Americas. Its most famous object is the goat rearing into the branches of a rosette-leafed plant, from the royal tombs of Ur.\nPenn Museum's excavations and collections foster a strong research base for graduate students in the Graduate Group in the Art and Archaeology of the Mediterranean World. Features of the Beaux-Arts building include a rotunda and gardens that include Egyptian papyrus.\nOther Penn museums and galleries.\nPenn maintains a website providing a detailed roadmap to small museums and galleries and over one hundred locations across campus where the public can access Penn's over 8,000 artworks acquired over 250 years, which includes paintings, sculptures, photography, works on paper, and decorative arts. The largest of the art galleries is the Institute of Contemporary Art, one of the only kunsthalles in the country, which showcases various art exhibitions throughout the year. Since 1983, the Arthur Ross Gallery, located at the Fisher Fine Arts Library, has housed Penn's art collection and is named for its benefactor, philanthropist Arthur Ross.\nResidences.\nEvery College House at the University of Pennsylvania has at least four members of faculty in the roles of House Dean, Faculty Master, and College House Fellows. Within the College Houses, Penn has nearly 40 themed residential programs for students with shared interests such as world cinema or science and technology. Many of the nearby homes and apartments in the area surrounding the campus are often rented by undergraduate students moving off campus after their first year, as well as by graduate and professional students.\nThe College Houses include W.E.B. Du Bois, Fisher Hassenfeld, Gregory, Gutmann, Harnwell, Harrison, Hill College House, Kings Court English, Lauder, Riepe, Rodin, Stouffer, and Ware. The first College House was Van Pelt College House, established in the fall of 1971. It was later renamed Gregory House. Fisher Hassenfeld, Ware and Riepe together make up one building called \"The Quad\". The latest College House to be built is Guttman (formerly named New College House West), which opened in the fall of 2021.\nPenn students in Junior or Senior year may live in the 45 sororities and fraternities governed by three student-run governing councils, Interfraternity Council, Intercultural Greek Council, and Panhellenic Council.\nOrganization.\nThe College of Arts and Sciences is the undergraduate division of the School of Arts and Sciences. The School of Arts and Sciences also contains the Graduate Division and the College of Liberal and Professional Studies, which is home to the Fels Institute of Government, the master's programs in Organizational Dynamics, and the Environmental Studies (MES) program. Wharton School is the business school of the University of Pennsylvania. Other schools with undergraduate programs include the School of Nursing and the School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS).\nThe current president is J. Larry Jameson (interim).\nCampus police.\nThe University of Pennsylvania Police Department (UPPD) is the largest private police department in Pennsylvania, with 117 members. All officers are sworn municipal police officers and retain general law enforcement authority while on the campus.\nSeal.\nThe official seal of the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania serves as the signature and symbol of authenticity on documents issued by the corporation. The most recent design, a modified version of the original seal, was approved in 1932, adopted a year later and is still used for much of the same purposes as the original.\nThe official seal of the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania serves as the signature and symbol of authenticity on documents issued by the corporation. A request for one was first recorded in a meeting of the trustees in 1753 during which some of the Trustees \"desired to get a Common Seal engraved for the Use of [the] Corporation.\" In 1756, a public seal and motto for the college was engraved in silver.\nThe outer ring of the current seal is inscribed with \"Universitas Pennsylvaniensis\", the Latin name of the University of Pennsylvania. The inside contains seven stacked books on a desk with the titles of subjects of the trivium and a modified quadrivium, components of a classical education: Theolog[ia], Astronom[ia], Philosoph[ia], Mathemat[ica], Logica, Rhetorica and Grammatica. Between the books and the outer ring is the Latin motto of the university, \"Leges Sine Moribus Vanae\".\nAcademics.\nPenn's \"One University Policy\" allows students to enroll in classes in any of Penn's twelve schools.\nPenn has a strong focus on interdisciplinary learning and research. It offers double degree programs, unique majors, and academic flexibility. Penn's \"One University\" policy allows undergraduates access to courses at all of Penn's undergraduate and graduate schools except the medical, veterinary and dental schools. Undergraduates at Penn may also take courses at Bryn Mawr, Haverford, and Swarthmore under a reciprocal agreement known as the Quaker Consortium.\nAdmissions.\nUndergraduate admissions to the University of Pennsylvania is considered by \"US News\" to be \"most selective\". Admissions officials consider a student's GPA to be a very important academic factor, with emphasis on an applicant's high school class rank and letters of recommendation. Admission is need-blind for U.S., Canadian, and Mexican applicants.\nFor the class of 2026, entering in Fall 2022, the university received 54,588 applications. \"The Atlantic\" also ranked Penn among the 10 most selective schools in the country. At the graduate level, based on admission statistics from \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\", Penn's most selective programs include its law school, the health care schools (medicine, dental medicine, nursing, veterinary), the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and the Wharton School.\nCoordinated dual-degree, accelerated, interdisciplinary programs.\nPenn offers unique and specialized coordinated dual-degree (CDD) programs, which selectively award candidates degrees from multiple schools at the university upon completion of graduation criteria of both schools in addition to program-specific programs and senior capstone projects. Additionally, there are accelerated and interdisciplinary programs offered by the university. These undergraduate programs include:\nDual-degree programs that lead to the same multiple degrees without participation in the specific above programs are also available. Unlike CDD programs, \"dual degree\" students fulfill requirements of both programs independently without the involvement of another program. Specialized dual-degree programs include Liberal Studies and Technology as well as an Artificial Intelligence: Computer and Cognitive Science Program. Both programs award a degree from the College of Arts and Sciences and a degree from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Also, the Vagelos Scholars Program in Molecular Life Sciences allows its students to either double major in the sciences or submatriculate and earn both a BA and an MS in four years. The most recent Vagelos Integrated Program in Energy Research (VIPER) was first offered for the class of 2016. A joint program of Penn's School of Arts and Sciences and the School of Engineering and Applied Science, VIPER leads to dual Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science in Engineering degrees by combining majors from each school.\nFor graduate programs, Penn offers many formalized double degree graduate degrees such as a joint J.D./MBA and maintains a list of interdisciplinary institutions, such as the Institute for Medicine and Engineering, the Joseph H. Lauder Institute for Management and International Studies, and the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science.\nThe School of Social Policy and Practice, commonly known as Penn SP2, is a school of social policy and social work that offers degrees in a variety of subfields, in addition to several dual degree programs and sub-matriculation programs. Penn SP2's vision is: \"The passionate pursuit of social innovation, impact and justice.\"\nOriginally named the School of Social Work, SP2 was founded in 1908 and is a graduate school of the University of Pennsylvania. The school specializes in research, education, and policy development in relation to both social and economic issues.\nThe School of Veterinary Medicine offers five dual-degree programs, combining the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (VMD) with a Master of Social Work (MSW), Master of Environmental Studies (MES), Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), Master of Public Health (MPH) or Masters in Business Administration (MBA) degree. The Penn Vet dual-degree programs are meant to support veterinarians planning to engage in interdisciplinary work in the areas of human health, environmental health, and animal health and welfare.\nAcademic medical center and biomedical research complex.\nIn 2018, the university's nursing school was ranked number one by Quacquarelli Symonds. That year, Quacquarelli Symonds also ranked Penn's school of Veterinary Medicine sixth. In 2019, the Perelman School of Medicine was named the third-best medical school for research in \"U.S. News &amp; World Report's\" 2020 ranking.\nThe University of Pennsylvania Health System, also known as UPHS, is a multi-hospital health system headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, owned by Trustees of University of Pennsylvania. UPHS and the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania together constitute Penn Medicine, a clinical and research entity of the University of Pennsylvania. UPHS hospitals include the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Penn Presbyterian Medical Center, Pennsylvania Hospital, Chester County Hospital, Lancaster General Hospital, and Princeton Medical Center. Penn Medicine owns and operates the first hospital in the United States, the Pennsylvania Hospital. It is also home to America's first surgical amphitheatre and its first medical library.\nInternational partnerships.\nStudents can study abroad for a semester or a year at partner institutions, which include the Singapore Management University, London School of Economics, University of Edinburgh, Chinese University of Hong Kong, University of Melbourne, Sciences Po, University of Queensland, University College London, King's College London, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and ETH Zurich.\nReputation and rankings.\n\"U.S. News &amp; World Report\"'s 2024 rankings place Penn 6th of 394 national universities in the United States. The Princeton Review student survey ranked Penn in 2023 as 7th in their Dream Colleges list. Penn was ranked 4th of 444 in the United States by College Factual for 2024. In 2023, Penn was ranked as having the seventh-happiest students in the United States and the most happy among all Ivy League universities. Wall Street Journal reported in 2024 that Penn's undergraduate alumni earned the 5th highest salaries (taking into account the cost of education and other factors), which was 2nd in Ivy League behind Princeton.\nAmong its professional schools, the school of education was ranked number one in 2021 and Wharton School was ranked number one in 2022 and 2024 and the communication, dentistry, medicine, nursing, law and veterinary schools rank in the top 5 nationally. Penn's Law School was ranked number 4 in 2023 and Penn's School of Design and Architecture, and its School of Social Policy and Practice are ranked in the top 10.\nResearch.\nPenn is classified as an \"R1\" doctoral university: \"Highest research activity\".&lt;ref name=\"RU/VH\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Its economic impact on the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for 2015 amounted to $. Penn had research expenditures totaling over $ in 2023, raking third among U.S. universities in research and development spending, according to the National Science Foundation. In fiscal year 2019 Penn received $ in funding from the National Institutes of Health.\nPenn's research centers often span two or more disciplines. In the 2010\u20132011 academic year, five interdisciplinary research centers were created or substantially expanded; these include the Center for Health-care Financing, the Center for Global Women's Health at the Nursing School, the Morris Arboretum's Horticulture Center, the Jay H. Baker Retailing Center at Wharton and the Translational Research Center at Penn Medicine. With these additions, Penn now counts 165 research centers hosting a research community of over 4,300 faculty and over 1,100 postdoctoral fellows, 5,500 academic support staff and graduate student trainees. To further assist the advancement of interdisciplinary research President Amy Gutmann established the \"Penn Integrates Knowledge\" title awarded to selected Penn professors \"whose research and teaching exemplify the integration of knowledge.\" These professors hold endowed professorships and joint appointments between Penn's schools.\nPenn is also among the most prolific producers of doctoral students. With 487 PhDs awarded in 2009, Penn ranks third in the Ivy League behind Columbia and Cornell; Harvard did not report data. It also has one of the highest numbers of post-doctoral appointees (933 in number for 2004\u20132007), ranking third in the Ivy League (behind Harvard and Yale) and tenth nationally.\nIn most disciplines Penn professors' productivity is among the highest in the nation and first in the fields of epidemiology, business, communication studies, comparative literature, languages, information science, criminal justice and criminology, social sciences and sociology. According to the National Research Council nearly three-quarters of Penn's 41 assessed programs were placed in ranges including the top 10 rankings in their fields, with more than half of these in ranges including the top five rankings in these fields.\nPenn's research tradition has historically been complemented by innovations that shaped higher education. In addition to establishing the first medical school, the first university teaching hospital, the oldest continuously operating degree-granting program in chemical engineering, the first business school, and the first student union, Penn was also the cradle of other significant developments.\nIn 1852, Penn Law was the first law school in the nation to publish a law journal still in existence (then called \"The American Law Register,\" now the \"Penn Law Review\", one of the most cited law journals in the world). Under the deanship of William Draper Lewis, the law school was also one of the first schools to emphasize legal teaching by full-time professors instead of practitioners, a system that is still followed today.\nThe Wharton School was home to several pioneering developments in business education. It established the first research center in a business school in 1921 and the first center for entrepreneurship in 1973 and it regularly introduced novel curricula for which \"BusinessWeek\" wrote, \"Wharton is on the crest of a wave of reinvention and change in management education.\" The university has also contributed major advancements in the fields of economics and management. Among the many discoveries are conjoint analysis, widely used as a predictive tool especially in market research, Simon Kuznets's method of measuring gross national product, the Penn effect (the observation that consumer price levels in richer countries are systematically higher than in poorer ones) and the \"Wharton Model\" developed by Nobel-laureate Lawrence Klein to measure and forecast economic activity. The idea behind Health Maintenance Organizations also belonged to Penn professor Robert Eilers, who put it into practice during then-president Nixon's health reform in the 1970s.\nSeveral major scientific discoveries have also taken place at Penn. The university is probably best known as the place where the first general-purpose electronic computer (ENIAC) was born in 1946 at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering. It was here also where the world's first spelling and grammar checkers were created, as well as the popular COBOL programming language.\nPenn can also boast some of the most important discoveries in the field of medicine. The dialysis machine used as an artificial replacement for lost kidney function was conceived and devised out of a pressure cooker by William Inouye while he was still a student at Penn Med; the Rubella and Hepatitis B vaccines were developed at Penn; the discovery of cancer's link with genes, cognitive therapy, Retin-A (the cream used to treat acne), Resistin, the Philadelphia gene (linked to chronic myelogenous leukemia) and the technology behind PET Scans were all discovered by Penn Med researchers. More recent gene research has led to the discovery of the genes for fragile X syndrome, the most common form of inherited mental retardation; spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, a disorder marked by progressive muscle wasting; Charcot\u2013Marie\u2013Tooth disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects the hands, feet and limbs; and genetically engineered T cells used to treat lymphoblastic leukemia and refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Another contribution to medicine was made by Ralph L. Brinster (Penn faculty member since 1965) who developed the scientific basis for in vitro fertilization and the transgenic mouse at Penn and was awarded the National Medal of Science in 2010.\nPenn professors Alan J. Heeger, Alan MacDiarmid and Hideki Shirakawa invented a conductive polymer process that earned them the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The theory of superconductivity was also partly developed at Penn, by then-faculty member John Robert Schrieffer (along with John Bardeen and Leon Cooper).\nPenn professors Carl June and Michael C. Milone at Penn Medicine developed Kymriah, the first FDA-approved CAR T cell therapy for treating certain types of leukemia, approved in August 2017.\nStudent life.\nOf those accepted for admission in 2018, 48 percent were Asian, Hispanic, African-American or Native American. Fourteen percent of entering undergraduates in 2018 were international students. The composition of international first-year students in 2018 was: 46% from Asia; 15% from Africa and the Middle East; 16% from Europe; 14% from Canada and Mexico; 8% from the Caribbean, Central America and South America; 5% from Australia and the Pacific Islands. The acceptance rate for international students admission in 2018 was 493 out of 8,316 (6.7%). In 2018, 55% of all enrolled students were women.\nIn the last few decades, Jewish enrollment has been declining. c.\u20091999 about 28% of the students were Jewish. In early 2020, 1,750 Penn undergraduate students were Jewish, which would be approximately 17% of the some 10,000 undergrads for 2019\u201320.\nPenn has been ranked as the number one LGBTQ+ friendly school in the country. Penn's LGBTQ+ center is second oldest in the nation and oldest in Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as it has been serving the LGBTQ+ community since 1979 by providing support and guidance through 25 groups (including Penn J-Bagel a Jewish LGBTQ+ group, the Lambda Alliance a general LGBTQ social organization, and oSTEM a group for LGBTQ people in STEM fields). Penn offers courses in Sexuality and Gender Studies which allows students to discover and learn queer theory, history of sexual norms, and other gender orientation related courses.\nPenn Face and behavioral health.\nThe university's social pressure surrounding academic perfection, extreme competitiveness, and nonguaranteed readmission have created what is known as \"Penn Face\": students put on a fa\u00e7ade of confidence and happiness while enduring mental turmoil. Stanford University calls this phenomenon \"Duck Syndrome\". In recent years, mental health has become an issue on campus with ten student suicides between the years of 2013 to 2016. The school responded by launching a task force. The most widely covered case of Penn Face has been Madison Holleran. In 2018, initiatives were enacted to ameliorate mental health problems, such as requiring sophomores to live on campus and the daily closing of Huntsman Hall at 2:00\u00a0a.m. The university's suicide rate was the catalyst for a 2018 state bill, introduced by Governor Tom Wolf, to raise Pennsylvania's standards for university suicide prevention. The university's efforts to address mental health on campus came into the national spotlight again in September 2019 when the director of the university's counseling services died by suicide six months after starting the position.\nStudent organizations.\nThe Philomathean Society, founded in 1813, is the United States' oldest continuously existing collegiate literary society and continues to host lectures and intellectual events open to the public.\n\"The Daily Pennsylvanian\" is an independent, student-run newspaper, which has been published daily since it was founded in 1885. The newspaper went unpublished from May 1943 to November 1945 due to World War II. In 1984, the university lost all editorial and financial control of \"The Daily Pennsylvanian\" (also known as \"The DP\") when the newspaper became its own corporation. \"The Daily Pennsylvanian\" has won the Pacemaker Award administered by the Associated Collegiate Press multiple times, most recently in 2019. The \"DP\" also publishes a weekly arts and culture magazine called \"34th Street Magazine\".\nThe Penn Debate Society (PDS), founded in 1984 as the Penn Parliamentary Debate Society, is Penn's debate team, which competes regularly on the American Parliamentary Debate Association and the international British Parliamentary circuit.\nThe \"Penn History Review\" is a journal, published twice a year, through the Department of History, for undergraduate historical research, by and for undergraduates, and founded in 1991.\nPenn Electric Racing.\nPenn Electric Racing is the university's Formula SAE (FSAE) team, competing in the international electric vehicle (EV) competition. Colloquially known as \"PER\", the team designs, manufactures, and races custom electric racecars against other collegiate teams. In 2015, PER built and raced their first racecar, REV1, at the Lincoln Nebraska FSAE competition, winning first place. The team repeated their success with their next two racecars: REV2 won second place in 2016, and REV3 won first place in 2017.\nPerforming arts organizations.\nPenn is home to numerous organizations that promote the arts, from dance to spoken word, jazz to stand-up comedy, theatre, a cappella and more. The Performing Arts Council (PAC) oversees 45 student organizations in these areas. The PAC has four subcommittees: A Cappella Council; Dance Arts Council; Singer, Musicians, and Comedians (SMAC); and Theatre Arts Council (TAC-e).\nPenn Glee Club.\nThe University of Pennsylvania Glee Club, founded in 1862, is tied for fourth oldest continually running glee clubs in the United States and the oldest performing arts group at the University of Pennsylvania. \nEach year, the Penn Glee Club writes and produces a fully staged, Broadway-style production with an eclectic mix of Penn standards, Broadway classics, classical favorites, and pop hits, highlighting choral singing from all genders\nThe Glee Club draws its singing members from the undergraduate and graduate students.\nThe Penn Glee Club has traveled to nearly all 50 states in the United States and over 40 nations and territories on five continents and has appeared on national television with such celebrities as Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Jimmy Stewart, and Ed McMahon. Since its first performance at the White House for President Calvin Coolidge in 1926, the club has sung for numerous heads of state and world leaders.\nPenn Band.\nThe University of Pennsylvania Band has been a part of student life since 1897. The Penn Band presently mainly performs at football and basketball games as well as university functions (e.g. commencement and convocation). It was the first college band to perform at Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, and has performed with notable musicians, including John Philip Sousa, members of the Philadelphia Orchestra, and the U.S. Marine Band (\"The President's Own\").\nPenn Band has performed for Princess Grace Kelly of Monaco (sister and aunt to number of alumni), alumnus and District Attorney and Mayor of Philadelphia, and Governor of Pennsylvania Ed Rendell, Vice President Al Gore, presidents Theodore Roosevelt, Lyndon B. Johnson and Ronald Reagan, and Polish dissident and president Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa.\nPenn's a cappella community.\nThe A Cappella Council (ACK) is composed of 14 a cappella groups. Penn's a cappella groups entertain audiences with repertoires including pop, rock, R&amp;B, jazz, Hindi, and Chinese songs.\nACK is also home to Off The Beat, which has received the most contemporary a cappella recording awards of any collegiate group in the United States and the most features on the \"Best of College A Cappella\" albums. Penn Masala, formed in 1996, is world's oldest and premier South Asian a cappella group based in an American university, which has performed for Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Henry Kissinger, Ban Ki-moon, Farooq Abdullah, Imran Khan, Rajkumar Hirani, A.R. Rahman, Narendra Modi and Sunidhi Chauhan, had their a cappella version of Nazia Hassan's Urdu classic \"Aap Jaisa Koi\", (originally from the movie \"Qurbani\") sung in the movie American Desi.\nPenn alumni Elizabeth Banks (class of 1996) and Max Handelman (Banks' husband, class of 1995) invited Masala to appear in \"Pitch Perfect 2\", as Banks reported that Penn's a capella community inspired the film series starring or produced by Banks and Handleman.\nComedy organizations.\nMask and Wig, a club founded in 1889, was (until fall of 2021) the oldest all-male musical comedy troupe in the country. In 2021 the club voted to become gender-inclusive, with auditions open to all undergraduates: male, female, and non-binary.\nBloomers comedy group, founded in 1978, is the .\".. nation's first collegiate all-women musical and sketch comedy troupe...\"\nBloomers was founded at Penn by Joan Harrison. In the mid teens, Bloomers revised its constitution to be open to .\".. anyone who does not identify as a cisgender man...\" and now accepts all persons from under-represented gender identities who perform comedy. Bloomers performs sketches and elaborate shows almost every semester. The comedy troupe is named after bloomers, the once popular long, loose fitting undergarment, gathered at the ankle, worn under a short skirt (developed in the mid 19th century as a healthy comfortable alternative to the heavy, constricting dresses then worn by American women), which were in turn, named after Amelia Jenks Bloomer. Bloomers' most well-known performing alumna is Vanessa Bayer, formerly of Saturday Night Live and is SNL's longest-serving female cast member.\nReligious and spiritual organizations.\nThe following religious and spiritual organizations have a significant on campus presence at Penn:\n(A) Mainstream Protestantism:\nDating back to 1857, The Christian Association (a.k.a. The CA), is composed primarily of students from Mainline Protestant backgrounds. Historically, the CA ran several foreign missions including one in China and for decades ran a camp for socio-economically disadvantaged children from Philadelphia. At present the CA occupies part of the parsonage at Tabernacle United Church of Christ.\n(B) Judaism:\nOrganized Jewish life did not begin on campus in earnest until the start of 20th century. Jewish Life on campus is centered at Penn branch of Hillel International, which inspires students to explore Judaism, creates patterns of Jewish living that can be sustained after graduation, provides religious communities, promotes educational initiatives, social justice projects, social and cultural opportunities, and groups focusing on Israel education and politics, and hosts a Kosher Penn approved dining hall (supervised by the Community Kashrus of Greater Philadelphia). In addition to Hillel, the other major Jewish organization with significant impact on Penn's campus is The Chabad Lubavitch House at Penn (founded in 1980), which, among other activities, brings together Jewish college students with noted Jewish academics for in-depth discussions and debate.\n(C) Roman Catholicism:\nThe Penn Newman Catholic Center (the Newman Center), founded in 1893 (as the first Newman Center in the country) with the mission of supporting students, faculty, and staff in their religious endeavors. The organization brings prominent Christian figures to campus, including Rev. Thomas \"Tom\" J. Hagan, OSFS, who worked in the Newman Center and founded Haiti-based non-profit Hands Together; and James Martin SJ (Wharton School undergraduate class of 1982). Father Martin, an editor-at-large of the Jesuit magazine \"America\", and frequent commentator on the life and teachings of Jesus and Ignatian spirituality, is especially well known for his outreach to the LGBT community, which has drawn a strong backlash from parts of the Catholic Church, but has provided comfort to Penn students and other members of Roman Catholic community who wish to stay connected with their faith and identify as LGBQT.\n(D)\u00a0Hinduism and Jainism:\nPenn funds (via the Graduate and Professional Student Assembly or similar undergraduate organization) a variety of official clubs focused on India including a number focused on students who are Hindu or Jain such as: (1)\u00a0'Pan-Asian American Community House (PAACH)', a center for students to celebrate South Asian, East Asian, Southeast Asian, culture and religion, (2)\u00a0'Rangoli\u2014The South Asian Association at Penn' that educates and informs Penn students (mainly graduate and professional students) with ancestry or interest in South Asia whose goals include a desire to \"rekindle the spirit of community\" through events, and (3)\u00a0'Penn Hindu &amp; Jain Association', a student-run official club at Penn that has 80 to 110 student members and an extensive alumni network, dedicated to raise awareness of the Hindu and Jain faiths and foster further development of these communities in the greater Philadelphia area by providing a variety of services and hosting a number of events such as Holi Festival (which has been held annually at Penn since 1993) and \"...aims to be a home to anyone seeking to explore their spiritual, religious, or social interests.\"\n(E) Islam:\nIn 1963, the Muslim Students' Association (MSA National) and Penn chapter of MSA National were founded to facilitate Muslim life among students on college campuses. Penn MSA was established to help Penn Muslims build faith and community by fostering a space under the guidance of Islamic principles and towards that goal Penn MSA supports mission of its related umbrella organization, Islamic Society of North America, to \"foster the development of the Muslim community, interfaith relations, civic engagement, and better understandings of Islam.\" The Muslim Life Program at Penn also provides such support and helped cause Penn (in January 2017) to hire its first full-time Muslim chaplain, the co-president of the Association of Campus Muslim Chaplains, Sister Patricia Anton (whose background includes working with Muslim, interfaith, academic and peace-building institutions such as Islamic Society of North America and Islamic Relief). Chaplain Anton's mandate includes supporting and guiding the Penn Muslim community to foster further development of such community by creating a welcoming environment that provides Penn Muslim community opportunities to intellectually and spiritually engage with Islam. Penn also has a residential house, the Muslim Life Residential Program, which provides a live/learn environment focused on the appreciation of Islamic culture, food, history, and practice, and shows its Penn student residents how Islam is deeply integrated in the culture of Philadelphia so they may appreciate how Islam influences daily life.\n(F) Buddhism:\nPenn has a Buddhist chaplain (as well as chaplains of other faiths) and funds the Penn Meditation and Buddhism Club, which (1)\u00a0is dedicated to helping Penn students practice mindfulness and meditation and learning about Buddhism, (2)\u00a0conducts weekly meetings that begin with a guided meditation and are followed by discussions of topic(s) relating to mindfulness and Buddhism, and (3)\u00a0organizes other activities such as ramen nights and weekend meditation retreats to the local Won Buddhism center.\nAthletics.\nPenn's sports teams are nicknamed the Quakers, but the teams are often also referred to as The Red and Blue as reflected in the popular song sung after every athletic contest where the Penn Band or other musical groups are present. The athletes participate in the Ivy League and Division\u00a0I (Division\u00a0I FCS for football) in the NCAA. In recent decades, they often have been league champions in football (14 times from 1982 to 2010) and basketball (22 times from 1970 to 2006). The first athletic team at Penn was the cricket team, which formed in 1842 and played regularly through 1846, the year it lost its \"grounds\", and then only played intermittently until 1864, the year it played its first intercollegiate game (against Haverford College).\nThe rowing (or crew) team composed of Penn students but not officially representing Penn was formed in 1854 but did not compete against other colleges as official part of Penn until 1879. The rugby football team began to play against other colleges, most notably against College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) in 1874 using a combination of association football (i.e. soccer) and rugby rules (the twenty players on each side were able to use their hands but were not able to pass or bat the ball forward).\nBaseball.\nThe University of Pennsylvania's first baseball team was fielded in 1875. Penn has won four championships in the Eastern Intercollegiate Baseball League, a baseball-only conference that existed from 1930 to 1992, which consisted of the eight Ivy League schools and Army and Navy.\nSince 1992, Penn baseball has claimed an Ivy League title, advancing to the NCAA Division I Baseball Championship five times.\nBasketball.\nPenn basketball is steeped in tradition. Penn was retroactively recognized as the pre-NCAA tournament national champion for the 1919\u201320 and 1920\u201321 seasons by the Helms Athletic Foundation and for the 1919\u201320 season by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll. Penn made its only (and the Ivy League's second) Final Four appearance in 1979, where the Quakers lost to Magic Johnson-led Michigan State in Salt Lake City. (Dartmouth twice finished second in the tournament in the 1940s, but that was before the beginning of formal League play.) Penn's team is also a member of the Philadelphia Big 5, along with La Salle, Saint Joseph's, Temple, Villanova, and Drexel. In 2007, the men's team won its third consecutive Ivy League title and then lost in the first round of the NCAA Tournament to Texas A&amp;M. Penn last made the NCAA tournament in 2018 where it lost to top seeded Kansas.\nCricket.\nThe first University of Pennsylvania cricket team, reported to be the first cricket team in the United States composed exclusively of Americans, was organized in 1842.\nOn May 7, 1864, Penn played its first intercollegiate game against Haverford College (the 3rd oldest intercollegiate athletic contest after Harvard Yale 1852 crew race and Amherst Williams 1859 Baseball game). After Penn moved west of the Schuylkill River in 1872, Penn played cricket at one of the local clubs, Belmont Cricket Club, Merion Cricket Club, Germantown Cricket Club, or at Haverford College. Beginning in 1875 and through 1880, Penn fielded a varsity eleven, which played a few matches each year against opponents that included Haverford College and Columbia College.\nIn 1881, Penn, Harvard College, Haverford College, Princeton College (then known as College of New Jersey), and Columbia College formed the Intercollegiate Cricket Association, which Cornell University later joined. Penn won The Intercollegiate Cricket Association championship, the \"de facto\" national championship, 23 times (18 solo, three shared with Haverford and Harvard, one shared with Haverford and Cornell, and one shared with just Haverford) during the 44 years that The Intercollegiate Cricket Association existed from 1881 through 1924.\nIn the 1890s, Penn's cricket team frequently toured Canada and the British Isles. Perhaps the university's most famous cricket player was George Patterson (class of 1888), who still holds the North American batting record and who went on to play for the professional Philadelphia Cricket Team.\nFollowing the World War I, cricket began to experience a serious decline, such that in 1924 Penn fielded its last team in the twentieth century. Starting in 2009, however, Penn once again fielded a cricket team, albeit club, that ended up being the first winner of a tournament for teams from the Ivies.\nCurling.\nUniversity of Pennsylvania Curling Club qualified for the 2023 National Championship at 6th place, the same ranking they qualified for the 2022 National Championship (where they finished in 2nd place), but in 2023 the team won the national championship by defeating arch rival Princeton University in the championship match (6 to 3). Penn Curling also won the National Championship in 2016 and is the only East Coast team to have won the Curling National Championship.\nFootball.\nPenn first fielded a football team against Princeton at the Germantown Cricket Club in Philadelphia on November 11, 1876.\nDuring the 1890s, Penn's coach and alumnus George Washington Woodruff introduced the quarterback kick, a forerunner of the forward pass, as well as the place-kick from scrimmage and the delayed pass.\nThe achievements of two of Penn's other outstanding players from that era, John Heisman, a Law School alumnus, and John Outland, a Penn Med alumnus, are remembered each year with the presentation of the Heisman Trophy to the most outstanding college football player of the year, and the Outland Trophy to the most outstanding college football interior lineman of the year.\nThe Bednarik Award, named for Chuck Bednarik, a three-time All-American center and linebacker who starred on the 1947, is awarded annually to college football's best defensive player. Bednarik went on to play for 12 years with the Philadelphia Eagles, and was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1969.\nPenn's game against University of California, Berkeley on September 29, 1951, in front of a crowd of 60,000 at Franklin Field, was first college football game to be broadcast in color.\nIce hockey.\nPenn's first ice hockey team competed during the 1896\u201397 academic year, and joined the nascent Intercollegiate Hockey Association (IHA) in 1898\u201399. On the first team in 1896\u201397 were several players of Canadian background, among them middle-distance runner and Olympian George Orton (the \"first disabled person to compete in the Olympics\"). Penn fielded teams intermittently until 1965 when it formed a varsity squad that was terminated in 1977. Penn now fields a club team that plays in the American Collegiate Hockey Association Division II, is a member of the Colonial States College Hockey Conference, and continues to play at the Class of 1923 Arena in Philadelphia.\nOlympic athletes.\nAt least 43 Penn alumni have earned 81 Olympic medals (26 gold). Penn won more of its \"medals\" (which were actually cups, trophies, or plaques, as medals were not introduced until a later Olympics) at 1900 Summer Olympics held in Paris than at any other Olympics.\nIn the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, 13 Penn present students or alumni participated in 5 sports (athletics [4], breaking [1], fencing [3], rowing [4], and swimming [1] for 7 countries (Australia [1], Bermuda [1], Canada [2], Egypt [1], Nigeria [1], Slovenia [1], and USA [6])\nRowing.\nRowing at Penn dates back to at least 1854 with the founding of the University Barge Club. The university currently hosts both heavyweight and lightweight men's teams and an open weight women's team, all of which compete as part of the Eastern Sprints League. Ellis Ward was Penn's first intercollegiate crew coach from 1879 through 1912. During the course of Ward's coaching career at Penn his .\".. Red and Blue crews won 65 races, in about 150 starts.\" Ward coached Penn's 8-oared boat to the finals of the Grand Challenge Cup (the oldest and most prized trophy) at the Henley Royal Regatta (but in that final race was defeated by the champion Leander Club).\nPenn Rowing has produced a long list of famous coaches and Olympians. Members of Penn crew team, rowers Sidney Jellinek, Eddie Mitchell, and coxswain, John G. Kennedy, won the bronze medal for the United States at 1924 Olympics.\nJoe Burk (class of 1935) was captain of Penn crew team, winner of the Henley Diamond Sculls twice, named recipient of the James E. Sullivan Award for nation's best amateur athlete in 1939, and Penn coach from 1950 to 1969. The 1955 Men's Heavyweight 8, coached by Joe Burk, became one of only four American university crews in history to win the Grand Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta. The outbreak of World War Two canceled the 1940 Olympics for which Burk was favored to win the gold medal.\nOther Penn Olympic athletes and or Penn coaches of such athletes include:\n(a) John Anthony Pescatore (who competed in the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games for the United States as stroke of the men's coxed eight which earned a bronze medal and later competed at the 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games in the men's coxless pair),\n(b) Susan Francia (winner of gold medals as part of the women's 8 oared boat at 2008 Olympics and 2012 Olympics),\n(c) Regina Salmons (member of 2021 USA team), \n(d) Rusty Callow, \n(e) Harry Parker,\n(f) Ted Nash, and\n(g) John B. Kelly Jr., son of John B. Kelly Sr. (winner of three medals at 1920 Summer Olympics) and brother of Princess Grace of Monaco, was the second Penn Crew alumnus to win the James E. Sullivan Award for being nation's best amateur athlete (in 1947), who was winner of a bronze medal at the 1956 Summer Olympics).\nPenn men's crew team won the National Collegiate Rowing Championship in 1991. A member of that team, Janusz Hooker (Wharton School class of 1992) won the bronze medal in Men's Quadruple Sculls for Australia at the 1996 Summer Olympics. The Penn teams presently row out of College Boat Club, No. 11 Boathouse Row.\nRugby.\nThe Penn men's rugby football team is one of the oldest collegiate rugby teams in the United States. Penn first fielded a team in mid-1870s playing by rules much closer to the rugby union and association football code rules relative to American football rules (as such American football rules had not yet been invented). Among its earliest games was a game against the College of New Jersey, which became Princeton in 1895, played in Philadelphia on Saturday, November 11, 1876, which was less than two weeks before Princeton met on November 23, 1876, with Harvard and Columbia to confirm that all their games would be played using the rugby union rules. Princeton and Penn played their November 1876 game per a combination of rugby (there were 20 players per side and players were able to touch the ball with their hands) and Association football codes. The rugby code influence was due, in part, to the fact that some of their students had been educated in English public schools. Among the prominent alumni to play in a 19th-century version of rugby in which rules then did not allow forward passes or center snaps was John Heisman, namesake of the Heisman Trophy and an 1892 graduate of the University of Pennsylvania Law School.\nHeisman was instrumental in the first decade of the 20th century in changing the rules to more closely relate to the present rules of American football. One of Heisman's teammates (who was unanimously voted Captain in the fall after Heisman graduated) was Harry Arista Mackey, Penn Law class of 1893 (who subsequently served as Mayor of Philadelphia from 1928 to 1932).\nIn 1906, Rugby per Rugby Union code was reintroduced to Penn (as Penn last played per Rugby Union Code in 1882 as Penn played rugby per a number of different rugby football rulebooks and codes from 1883 through 1890s) by Frank Villeneuve Nicholson (Penn Dental School (class of 1910)), who in 1904 had captained the Australian national rugby team in its match against England.\nPenn played per rugby union code rules at least through 1912, contemporaneously with Penn playing American gridiron football. Evidence of such may be found in an October 22, 1910, \"Daily Pennsylvanian\" article (quoted below) and a yearbook photo that rugby per rugby union code was played.{\nThe player-coach of United States Olympic gold-winning rugby team at the 1924 Summer Olympics was Alan Valentine, who played rugby while at Penn (which he attended during 1921/1922 academic year) as he was getting a master's degree at Wharton.\nThough Penn played rugby per rugby union rules from 1929 through 1934, there is no indication that Penn had a rugby team from 1935 through 1959 when Penn men's rugby became permanent due to leadership of Harry \"Joe\" Edwin Reagan III Penn's College class of 1962 and Penn Law class of 1965, who also went onto help create and incorporate (in 1975) and was Treasurer (in 1981) of USA Rugby and Oreste P. \"Rusty\" D'Arconte Penn's College class of 1966. Thus, with D'Arconte's hustle and Reagan's charisma and organizational skills, a team, which had fielded a side of fifteen intermittently from 1912 through 1960, became permanent.\nIn spring of 1984, Penn women's rugby, led by Social Chair Tamara Wayland (College class of 1985, who subsequently became the women's representative to and vice president of USA Rugby South from 1996 to 1998); club president Marianne Seligson; and Penn Law student Gigi Sohn, began to compete. Penn women's rugby team is coached, as of 2020, by (a) Adam Dick, a 300-level certified coach with over 15 years of rugby coaching experience including being the first coach of the first women's rugby team at the University of Arizona and who was a four-year starter at University of Arizona men's first XV rugby team and (b) Philly women's player Kate Hallinan.\nPenn's men's rugby team plays in the Ivy Rugby Conference and have finished as runners-up in both 15s and 7s in the Conference and won the Ivy Rugby Tournament in 1992. As of 2011[ [update]], the club uses the state-of-the-art facilities at Penn Park. The Penn Quakers' rugby team played on national TV at the 2013 Collegiate Rugby Championship, a college rugby tournament that for a number of years had been played each June at Subaru Park in Philadelphia, and was broadcast live on NBC. In their inaugural appearance in the tournament, the Penn men's rugby team won the Shield Competition, beating local Big Five rival, Temple University, 17\u201312 in the final. In the semifinal match of that Shield Competition, Penn Rugby became the first Philadelphia team to beat a non-Philadelphia team in CRC history, with a 14\u201312 win over the University of Texas.\nAs of 2020, Penn men's rugby team is coached by Tiger Bax, a former professional rugby player hailing from Cape Town, South Africa, whose playing experience includes stints in the Super Rugby competition with the Stormers (15s) and Mighty Mohicans (7s), as well as with the Gallagher Premiership Rugby side, Saracens and whose coaching experience includes three successful years as coach at Valley Rugby Football Club in Hong Kong; and Tyler May, from Cherry Hill, New Jersey, who played rugby at Pennsylvania State University where he was a first XV player for three years.\nPenn's graduate business and law schools also fielded rugby teams. The Wharton rugby team has competed from 1978 to the present. The Penn Law Rugby team (1985 through 1993) counts among its alumni Walter Joseph Jay Clayton, III Penn Law class of 1993, and chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission from May 4, 2017, until December 23, 2020, Raymond Hulser, former Chief of Public Integrity Section of United States Department of Justice (who also was hired by DOJ special counsel Jack Smith to investigate the alleged mishandling by former President Donald J. Trump of certain top secret documents), and Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart who approved the search of Mar-a-Lago, the residence of current U.S. president Donald Trump in Palm Beach, Florida.\nUndergraduate Penn Rugby Alumni include (1) Conor Lamb (Penn College class of 2006 and Penn Law class of 2009), who played for undergraduate team, and, as of 2021, is a member of United States House of Representatives, elected originally to Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district, since 2019 is a U.S. Representative from Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district and (2) Argentina's richest person, Marcos Galperin (Wharton Undergraduate Class of 1994), a premier player on the 1992 Ivy League Tournament championship team, who founded Mercado Libre, an online marketplace dedicated to e-commerce and online auction, which, as of 2016, is the most popular e-commerce site in South America by number of visitors.\nFacilities.\nFranklin Field, with a present seating capacity of 52,593, is where the Quakers play football, lacrosse, sprint football and track and field (and formerly played baseball, field hockey, soccer, and rugby). It is the oldest stadium still operating for college football games, first stadium to sport two tiers, first stadium in the country to have a scoreboard, second stadium to have a radio broadcast of football, first stadium from which a commercially televised football game was broadcast, and first stadium from which college football game was broadcast in color. Franklin Field also played host to the Philadelphia Eagles from 1958 to 1970. Since 1895, Franklin Field has hosted the annual collegiate track and field event \"the Penn Relays\", which is the oldest and largest track and field competition in the United States.\nPenn's Palestra is home gym of the Penn Quakers men's and women's basketball and volleyball teams, wrestling team, Philadelphia Big Five basketball, and other high school and college sporting events, and is located mere yards from Franklin Field. The Palestra has been called \"the most important building in the history of college basketball\" and \"changed the entire history of the sport for which it was built\". The Palestra has hosted more NCAA Tournament basketball games than any other facility.\nPenn's River Fields hosts a number of athletic fields including the Rhodes Soccer Stadium, the Ellen Vagelos C'90 Field Hockey Field, and Irving \"Moon\" Mondschein Throwing Complex. Penn baseball plays its home games at Meiklejohn Stadium at Murphy Field.\nPenn's Class of 1923 Arena (with seating for up to 3,000 people) was built to host the University of Pennsylvania Varsity Ice Hockey Team, which has been disbanded, and now hosts or in the past hosted: Penn's Men's and Penn Women's club ice hockey teams, practices or exhibition games for the Philadelphia Flyers, Colorado Avalanche and Carolina Hurricanes, roller hockey for the Philadelphia Bulldogs professional team, and rock concerts such as one in 1982 featuring Prince.\nPeople.\nNotable people.\nPenn alumni, faculty and trustees include those who have distinguished themselves in the sciences, academia, politics, business, military, sports, arts, and media.\nSince its founding, Penn alumni, trustees, and faculty have included eight Founding Fathers of the United States who signed the Declaration of Independence, seven who signed the United States Constitution, and 24 members of the Continental Congress.\nPenn alumni include two presidents of the United States (William Henry Harrison, and Donald Trump), 32 U.S. senators, 163 members of the U.S. House of Representatives, 19 U.S. Cabinet Secretaries, 46 governors, and 28 State Supreme Court justices, 36 billionaires, and as of 2023[ [update]] there have been 38 Nobel laureates affiliated (see List of Nobel laureates by university affiliation) with the University.\nPrior to becoming president of the United States, Joe Biden was a Benjamin Franklin Presidential Practice Professor at University of Pennsylvania, where he led the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, a center focused principally on diplomacy, foreign policy, and national security.\nNine foreign heads of state attended Penn (including former prime minister of the Philippines, Cesar Virata; first president of Nigeria, Nnamdi Azikiwe; first president of Ghana, Kwame Nkrumah, former Prime Minister of Latvia, Kri\u0161j\u0101nis Kari\u0146\u0161, former President of Panama, Ernesto P\u00e9rez Balladares, former President of Argentina, Mauricio Macri, former President of Estonia, Toomas Hendrik Ilves,\nand the current president of Ivory Coast, Alassane Ouattara. \nPenn alumni or faculty also include three United States Supreme Court justices (William J. Brennan, Owen J. Roberts, and James Wilson) and four Supreme Court justices of foreign nations, (including Ronald Wilson of the High Court of Australia, Ayala Procaccia of the Israel Supreme Court, Yvonne Mokgoro, former justice of the Constitutional Court of South Africa, and Irish Court of Appeal justice Gerard Hogan).\nPenn alumni in business, finance and investment banking include Warren Buffett (CEO of Berkshire Hathaway), Elon Musk (CEO of Tesla, cofounder of OpenAI and Neuralink, founder of SpaceX, The Boring Company and xAI), and Sundar Pichai (CEO of Alphabet and Google).\nPenn alumni have won 53 Tony Awards, 17 Grammy Awards, 25 Emmy Awards, 13 Oscars, and 1 EGOT (John Legend).\nIn the military, Penn alumni include Samuel Nicholas, \"founder\" of United States Marine Corps and William A. Newell, whose congressional action formed a predecessor to the current United States Coast Guard. Two Penn alumni have been NASA astronauts, and five Penn alumni have been awarded the Medal of Honor. \nAt least 43 different Penn alumni have earned 81 Olympic medals (26 gold).\nPenn's alumni also include poets Ezra Pound and William Carlos Williams, civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., linguist and political theorist Noam Chomsky, architect Louis Kahn, cartoonist Charles Addams, actresses Candice Bergen and Elizabeth Banks, murder suspect Luigi Mangione, and educator Alice West Fleet, one of the first black women to obtain a master\u2019s degree in the university.\nAlumni organizations.\nPenn has over 120 international alumni clubs in 52 countries and 37 states, which offer opportunities for alumni to reconnect, participate in events, and work on collaborative initiatives. In addition, in 1989, Penn bought a 14-story clubhouse building (purpose-built for Yale Club) in New York City from Touro College for $ to house Penn's largest alumni chapter. After raising a separate $ (including $+ donations each from such alumni as Estee Lauder heirs Leonard Lauder and Ronald Lauder, Saul Steinberg, Michael Milken, Donald Trump, and Ronald Perelman) and two years of renovation, the Penn Club of New York moved to its current location at 30 West 44th Street on NYC's Clubhouse Row.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31795", "revid": "194203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31795", "title": "Ultramagnetic MCs", "text": "American hip hop group\nThe Ultramagnetic MCs (rendered as Ultramagnetic MC's) is an American hip hop group based in the Bronx, New York City. Founded by Kool Keith, the group also includes Ced Gee, TR Love, and Moe Love. Big D was brought into the group by his cousin Kool Keith as a hype man in 1988. Tim Dog became an unofficial member in 1989. In 1990, DJ Jaycee was added as a road manager and backup DJ. A former member, Rooney Roon, was fired following an assault arrest. Beat-boxer Rahzel was a roadie for the group early in its career. The group's work was associated with unorthodox sampling, polysyllabic rhymes, and bizarre lyrical imagery.\nHistory.\nThe Ultramagnetic MCs formed in 1984. Their first single was \"To Give You Love\" (1985) on the Diamond International label. The group released \"Ego Trippin'\", their first 12-inch single, on Next Plateau Records in 1986. It was the first hip hop song to feature the \"Synthetic Substitution\" drum break sample, composed by Melvin Bliss and one of the most sampled songs of all time. The group's next single was \"Travelling at the Speed of Thought (Original)\"/\"M.C.'s Ultra (Part Two)\" followed by \"Funky\"/\"Mentally Mad\", one of their most sought-after 12-inch singles. \"Travelling\" used extensive sampling from \"Louie Louie\" by the Kingsmen while \"Funky\" was based on a Joe Cocker piano sample later used as the basis for 2Pac's \"California Love\". The single was released in 1987, and led to the release of the group's first album.\nThe Ultramagnetic MCs released a new school classic in 1988, \"Critical Beatdown\", introducing many new sampling techniques. Many believe that without the group's primary producer, Ced Gee, the golden era of sampling may have looked very different. Ced, while uncredited, also produced the majority of Boogie Down Productions' seminal \"Criminal Minded\". These albums are among the first to use \"chopped\" samples, rearranged and edited to change context. Both albums also feature many James Brown samples, which became prominent in hip hop in ensuing years. KRS-One has been quoted as saying that he was close to joining Ultramagnetic MCs early on. Paul C. was also a major contributor to \"Critical Beatdown\", producing \"Give The Drummer Some\", and engineering most of the album. Paul C. also produced the Hip-House mix of \"Traveling At The Speed Of Thought\", which was used as the group's first music video, and was their sole release in 1989. The single's b-side, \"A Chorus Line\", became one of Ultramagnetic's most popular songs and introduced new group affiliate Tim Dog. A variation of the \"A Chorus Line\" instrumental was used as the basis of Tim Dog's debut single, the Ced Gee-produced \"Fuck Compton\", which became a modest hit and is credited with helping to spark the East coast/West coast feud of the mid 1990s.\nThe group went on a hiatus for several years, breaking up temporarily in 1990. They returned on Mercury Records in 1992, with the album \"Funk Your Head Up\". The album received a muted response, in part because many tracks had been given a commercial sheen, having been remixed by outside producers at the label's insistence. Alternate mixes of this album's songs along with unreleased tracks from the sessions have appeared on later compilations. The song \"Poppa Large\", remixed by Da Beatminerz, became a hit and remains a staple of Kool Keith's live show. The song's video featured Keith in a straitjacket, his bald head encased in a birdcage.\nIn 1993, the group released the album \"The Four Horsemen\", which featured guest production and vocals by Godfather Don, who produced solo Kool Keith sessions in 1992. Some of those tracks appear on \"The Four Horsemen\", and also on \"Cenobites\". The former was the last official album the Ultramagnetic MC's released until their 2007 reunion.\nThere were many semi-legitimate and compilation albums to follow, the most official of which was Next Plateau's \"The B-Sides Companion\", which featured a new song, some unreleased 1989 songs recorded for a second Next Plateau LP and most of the group's classic singles, albeit in newly remixed form. Ced Gee and Moe Love both provided demos and unreleased songs spanning the group's entire career to Tuff City for a series of four albums which were released without Kool Keith's consent. A live album, \"Brooklyn To Brixton\", was announced but abandoned.\nAs a reaction to Ced and Moe's involvement in the Tuff City releases, Kool Keith and Tim Dog reunited on the album \"Big Time\", released under the group name Ultra in 1997. Kool Keith went on to record many solo CDs, including several under aliases such as Dr. Octagon and Dr. Dooom. His abstract rhymes and syncopated, off-beat delivery influenced many rappers, including Pharoahe Monch from Organized Konfusion and Ghostface Killah of Wu-Tang Clan.\nIn 2001, Ultramagnetic MCs released a single, \"Make It Rain\" / \"Mix It Down\". Two other songs, \"Baby, I'm Mad\" and \"Who Am I?\" were recorded at the same sessions, but remain officially unreleased. In 2004, the original versions of the Next Plateau singles were finally released on CD as bonus tracks on the remastered \"Critical Beatdown\". In a 9 December 2005 interview on Houston's \"Late Nite Snax\" radio show, Kool Keith confirmed rumours that the Ultramagnetic MC's had reformed and recorded a new album. Founding Ultramagnetic MC's member Ced Gee has set up Factshen Records. A new Ultramagnetic MC's LP, \"Back to the Future\u2014The Bronx Kings Are Back\", was scheduled to be released in 2006 but was later named \"The Best Kept Secret\" and released in January 2007. Although the album's cover features the original line-up of Kool Keith, Ced Gee, Moe Love and TR Love, TR (along with Tim Dog) were absent. Instead, guest verses are provided by newcomers like Grafiq Malachi Sebek. However, Tim Dog and TR Love have each recently released songs featuring Ultramagnetic under their own names. The group also released a new song after the album's release called \"We About Chix\", the video can be seen on YouTube.\nThe group performed live at the ATP I'll Be Your Mirror festival curated by ATP &amp; Portishead in September 2011 in Asbury Park, New Jersey.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31797", "revid": "25046916", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31797", "title": "University of Oxford", "text": "Collegiate university in Oxford, England\nThe University of Oxford is a collegiate research university in Oxford, England. There is evidence of teaching as early as 1096, making it the oldest university in the English-speaking world and the world's second-oldest university in continuous operation. It grew rapidly from 1167, when Henry II prohibited English students from attending the University of Paris. After escalating conflict between students and the Oxford townspeople, some Oxford academics fled northeast to Cambridge, where they established the University of Cambridge in 1209. The two universities share many common features and are jointly referred to as \"Oxbridge\".\nThe University of Oxford is made up of 43 colleges. Formally, only 36 of these are called colleges (independent bodies) while 4 are permanent private halls (owned by a larger religious organisation), and 3 are societies (controlled directly by the University). and a range of academic departments that are organised into four divisions. Colleges control their own membership and activities. Typically social life for students is centred around fellow college members. All students are members of a college. Oxford does not have a main campus. Its buildings and facilities are scattered throughout the city centre and around the town. Undergraduate teaching at the university consists of lectures, small-group tutorials at the colleges and halls, seminars, laboratory work and tutorials provided by the central university faculties and departments. Postgraduate teaching is provided in a predominantly centralised fashion.\nOxford operates the Ashmolean Museum, the world's oldest university museum; Oxford University Press, the largest university press in the world; and the largest academic library system nationwide. In the fiscal year ending 31 July 2024, the university had a total consolidated income of \u00a33.05\u00a0billion, of which \u00a3778.9\u00a0million was from research grants and contracts. In 2024, Oxford ranked first nationally for undergraduate education.\nOxford has educated a wide range of notable alumni, including 31 prime ministers of the United Kingdom and many heads of state and government around the world. As of October 2025,[ [update]] 76 Nobel Prize laureates, 4 Fields Medalists, and 6 Turing Award winners have matriculated, worked, or held visiting fellowships at the University of Oxford. Its alumni have won 160 Olympic medals. Oxford is home to a number of scholarships, including the Rhodes Scholarship, one of the oldest international graduate scholarship programmes in the world.\nHistory.\nFounding.\nThe University of Oxford's foundation date is unknown.\nWhile no official papal bull established Oxford, the university emerged in the 12th century as part of Western Europe's Catholic educational system. Nevertheless, a scholarly tradition observable in the 16th century claimed a far earlier 7th-century foundation by Archbishop Theodore of Tarsus (668\u2013690), this claim lacks documentary support, at least in the surviving record.\nEarly teaching was conducted by clerics like Theobald of \u00c9tampes, and the curriculum focused on theology and canon law, reflecting its ecclesiastical roots. Most scholars were members of the clergy until the Reformation.\nIn the 1300s, the chronicler Ranulf Higden wrote that the university was founded in the 9th century by Alfred the Great; the story is today considered apocryphal, although it was believed until the 18th century. It is known that teaching at Oxford existed in some form as early as 1096, but it is unclear when the university came into being. Scholar Theobald of \u00c9tampes lectured at Oxford in the early 1100s.\nThe university experienced rapid growth beginning in 1167, when English students were expelled from the University of Paris by order of King Henry II, who, amid tensions with France and the Church, banned his subjects from studying abroad\u2014prompting many scholars to return and establish a thriving academic community in Oxford. The historian Gerald of Wales lectured to such scholars in 1188, and the first known foreign scholar, Emo of Friesland, arrived in 1190. The head of the university had the title of chancellor from at least 1201, and the masters were recognised as a \"universitas\" or corporation in 1231. The university was granted a royal charter in 1248 during the reign of King Henry III. After disputes between students and Oxford townsfolk in 1209, some academics fled from the violence to Cambridge, later forming the University of Cambridge.\nThe students associated together on the basis of geographical origins, into two 'nations', representing the North (\"northerners\" or \"Boreales\", who included the English people from north of the River Trent and the Scots) and the South (\"southerners\" or \"Australes\", who included English people from south of the Trent, the Irish and the Welsh). In later centuries, geographical origins continued to influence many students' affiliations when membership of a college or hall became customary at Oxford. Additionally, members of many religious orders, including Dominicans, Franciscans, Carmelites, and Augustinians, settled in Oxford in the mid-13th century, gained influence and maintained houses or halls for students. At about the same time, private benefactors established colleges as self-contained scholarly communities. Among the earliest such founders were William of Durham, who in 1249 endowed University College, and John Balliol, father of a future King of Scots; Balliol College bears his name. Another founder, Walter de Merton, a Lord Chancellor of England and afterwards Bishop of Rochester, composed a series of regulations for college life; Merton College thereby became the model for such establishments at Oxford, as well as at Cambridge. Thereafter, an increasing number of students lived in colleges rather than in halls and religious houses.\nIn 1333\u20131334, an attempt by some dissatisfied Oxford scholars to found a new university at Stamford, Lincolnshire, was blocked by the universities of Oxford and Cambridge petitioning King Edward III. Thereafter, until the 1820s, no new universities were allowed to be founded in England, even in London; thus, Oxford and Cambridge had a duopoly, which was unusual in large western European countries.\nRenaissance period.\nThe new learning of the Renaissance greatly influenced Oxford from the late 15th century onwards. Among university scholars of the period were William Grocyn, who contributed to the revival of Greek language studies, and John Colet, the noted biblical scholar.\nWith the English Reformation and the break of communion with the Roman Catholic Church, recusant scholars from Oxford fled to continental Europe, settling especially at the University of Douai. The method of teaching at Oxford was transformed from the medieval scholastic method to Renaissance education, although institutions associated with the university experienced losses of land and revenues. As a centre of learning and scholarship, Oxford's reputation declined in the Age of Enlightenment; enrolments fell and teaching was neglected.\nIn 1636, William Laud, the chancellor and Archbishop of Canterbury, codified the university's statutes. These, for the most part, remained its governing regulations until the mid-19th century. Laud was also responsible for the granting of a charter securing privileges for the University Press, and he made notable contributions to the Bodleian Library, the main library of the university. From the beginnings of the Church of England as the established church until 1866, membership of the church was a requirement to graduate as a Bachelor of Arts, and Dissenters were only permitted to be promoted to Master of Arts starting in 1871. The university was a centre of the Royalist party during the English Civil War (1642\u20131651), while the town favoured the opposing Parliamentarian cause.\nWadham College, founded in 1610, was the undergraduate college of Sir Christopher Wren. He was part of a group of experimental scientists at Oxford in the 1650s, the Oxford Philosophical Club, which included Robert Boyle and Robert Hooke. This group, which has at times been linked with Boyle's \"Invisible College\", held regular meetings at Wadham under the guidance of the college's warden, John Wilkins, and the group formed the nucleus that went on to found the Royal Society.\nModern period.\nStudents.\nIn 1827, a major review of the university's statutes, some over 500 years old, was conducted. Among the changes made at this time was the removal of the requirement that students swear an oath of enmity towards an Oxford townsman Henry Symeonis, who was found guilty of murdering an Oxford student in the mid-13th century.\nBefore reforms in the early 19th century, the curriculum at Oxford was notoriously narrow and impractical. Sir Spencer Walpole, a historian of contemporary Great Britain and a senior government official, had not attended any university. He said, \"Few medical men, few solicitors, few persons intended for commerce or trade, ever dreamed of passing through a university career.\" He quoted the Oxford University Commissioners in 1852 stating: \"The education imparted at Oxford was not such as to conduce to the advancement in life of many persons, except those intended for the ministry.\" Nevertheless, Walpole argued:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Among the many deficiencies attending a university education there was, however, one good thing about it, and that was the education which the undergraduates gave themselves. It was impossible to collect some thousand or twelve hundred of the best young men in England, to give them the opportunity of making acquaintance with one another, and full liberty to live their lives in their own way, without evolving in the best among them, some admirable qualities of loyalty, independence, and self-control. If the average undergraduate carried from University little or no learning, which was of any service to him, he carried from it a knowledge of men and respect for his fellows and himself, a reverence for the past, a code of honour for the present, which could not but be serviceable. He had enjoyed opportunities... of intercourse with men, some of whom were certain to rise to the highest places in the Senate, in the Church, or at the Bar. He might have mixed with them in his sports, in his studies, and perhaps in his debating society; and any associations which he had this formed had been useful to him at the time, and might be a source of satisfaction to him in after life.\nOf the students who matriculated in 1840, 65% were sons of professionals (34% were Anglican ministers). After graduation, 87% became professionals (59% as Anglican clergy). Out of the students who matriculated in 1870, 59% were sons of professionals (25% were Anglican ministers). After graduation, 87% became professionals (42% as Anglican clergy).\nM.\u00a0C. Curthoys and H.\u00a0S. Jones argue that the rise of organised sport was one of the most remarkable and distinctive features of the history of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was carried over from the athleticism prevalent at the public schools such as Eton, Winchester, Shrewsbury, and Harrow.\nAll students, regardless of their chosen area of study, were required to spend (at least) their first year preparing for a first-year examination that was heavily focused on classical languages. Science students found this particularly burdensome and supported a separate science degree with Greek language study removed from their required courses. This concept of a Bachelor of Science had been adopted at other European universities (London University had implemented it in 1860) but an 1880 proposal at Oxford to replace the classical requirement with a modern language (like German or French) was unsuccessful. After considerable internal haggling over the structure of the arts curriculum, in 1886 the \"natural science preliminary\" was recognised as a qualifying part of the first year examination.\nAt the start of 1914, the university housed about 3,000 undergraduates and around 100 postgraduate students. During the First World War, many undergraduates and fellows joined the armed forces. By 1918 nearly all fellows were serving in uniform, and the student population in residence was reduced to 12% of the pre-war total. The records that, in total, 14,792 members of the university served in the war, with 2,716 (18.36%) killed. Not all the members of the university who served in the Great War fought with the Allies; there is a memorial to members of New College who served in the German armed forces, bearing the inscription, 'In memory of the men of this college who coming from a foreign land entered into the inheritance of this place and returning fought and died for their country in the war 1914\u20131918'. During the war years the university buildings became hospitals, cadet schools and military training camps.\nReforms.\nTwo parliamentary commissions in 1852 issued recommendations for Oxford and Cambridge. Archibald Campbell Tait, a former headmaster of Rugby School, was a key member of the Oxford Commission; he wanted Oxford to follow the German and Scottish model in which the professorship was paramount. The commission's report envisioned a centralised university run predominantly by professors and faculties, with a much stronger emphasis on research. The professional staff should be strengthened and better paid. For students, restrictions on entry should be dropped, and more opportunities given to poorer families. It called for an expansion of the curriculum, with honours to be awarded in many new fields. Undergraduate scholarships should be open to all Britons. Graduate fellowships should be opened up to all members of the university. It recommended that fellows be released from an obligation for ordination. Students were to be allowed to save money by boarding in the city, instead of in one of the colleges.\nThe system of separate honour schools for different subjects began in 1802, with Mathematics and Literae Humaniores. Schools of \"Natural Sciences\" and \"Law, and Modern History\" were added in 1853. By 1872, the last of these had split into \"Jurisprudence\" and \"Modern History\". Theology became the sixth honour school. In addition to these B.A. Honours degrees, the postgraduate Bachelor of Civil Law (B.C.L.) was, and still is, offered.\nThe mid-19th century saw the impact of the Oxford Movement (1833\u20131845), led, among others, by the future Cardinal John Henry Newman. Administrative reforms during the 19th century included the replacement of oral examinations with written entrance tests, greater tolerance for religious dissent, and the establishment of four women's colleges. Privy Council decisions in the 20th century - the abolition of compulsory daily worship, dissociation of the Regius Professorship of Hebrew from clerical status, diversion of colleges' theological bequests to other purposes - loosened the link with traditional belief and practice. Furthermore, although the university's emphasis had historically been on classical knowledge, its curriculum expanded during the 19th century to include scientific and medical studies.\nThe postgraduate degrees of Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Letters (renamed Master of Science and Master of Letters in the 1970s) were introduced in 1895, and the university began to award doctorates for research in 1900 with the Doctor of Letters and Doctor of Science degrees. Oxford was the first British university to institute a Doctor of Philosophy degree (abbreviated DPhil) in 1917; it was first awarded in 1919 to Lakshman Sarup of Balliol College.\nWomen's education.\nThe university passed a statute in 1875 allowing examinations for women at a level approximately equivalent to undergraduate studies; for a brief period in the early 1900s, this allowed the \"steamboat ladies\" to receive \"ad eundem\" degrees from the University of Dublin. In June 1878, the Association for the Education of Women (AEW) was formed, aiming for the eventual creation of a college for women in Oxford. Some of the more prominent members of the association were George Granville Bradley, T. H. Green and Edward Stuart Talbot. Talbot insisted on a specifically Anglican institution, which was unacceptable to most of the other members. The two parties eventually split, and Talbot's group founded Lady Margaret Hall in 1878, while T. H. Green founded the non-denominational Somerville College in 1879. Lady Margaret Hall and Somerville opened their doors to their first 21 students (12 at Somerville, 9 at Lady Margaret Hall) in 1879, who attended lectures in rooms above an Oxford baker's shop. There were also 25 women students living at home or with friends in 1879, a group which evolved into the Society of Oxford Home-Students and in 1952 into St Anne's College.\nThese first three societies for women were followed by St Hugh's (1886) and St Hilda's (1893). All of these colleges later became coeducational, starting with Lady Margaret Hall and St Anne's in 1979, and finishing with St Hilda's, which began to accept male students in 2008. In the early 20th century, Oxford and Cambridge were widely perceived to be bastions of male privilege; however, the integration of women into Oxford moved forward during the First World War. In 1916 women were admitted as medical students on a par with men, and in 1917 the university accepted financial responsibility for women's examinations.\nOn 7 October 1920 women became eligible for admission as full members of the university and were given the right to take degrees. In 1927 the university's dons created a quota that limited the number of female students to a quarter that of men, a ruling which was not abolished until 1957. Additionally, during this period Oxford colleges were single sex, so the number of women was also limited by the capacity of the women's colleges to admit students. It was not until 1959 that the women's colleges were given full collegiate status.\nIn 1974, Brasenose, Jesus, Wadham, Hertford and St Catherine's became the first formerly all-male colleges to admit women. The majority of men's colleges accepted their first female students in 1979, with Christ Church following in 1980, and Oriel becoming the last men's college to admit women in 1985. Most of Oxford's graduate colleges were founded as coeducational establishments in the 20th century, with the exception of St Antony's, which was founded as a men's college in 1950 and began to accept women only in 1962. By 1988, 40% of undergraduates at Oxford were female; in 2016, 45% of the student population, and 47% of undergraduate students, were female.\nIn June 2017, Oxford announced that starting in the 2018 academic year, history students may choose to sit a take-home exam in some courses, with the intention that this will equalise rates of firsts awarded to women and men at Oxford. That same summer, maths and computer science tests were extended by 15 minutes, in a bid to see if female student scores would improve.\nThe detective novel \"Gaudy Night\" by Dorothy L. Sayers, one of the first women to gain an academic degree from Oxford, is largely set in the all-female Shrewsbury College, Oxford (based on Sayers' own Somerville College), and the issue of women's education is central to its plot. Social historian and Somerville College alumna Jane Robinson's book \"Bluestockings: A Remarkable History of the First Women to Fight for an Education\" gives a very detailed and immersive account of this history.\nBuildings and sites.\nMain sites.\nThe university is a \"city university\" in that it does not have a main campus; instead, colleges, departments, accommodation, and other facilities are scattered throughout central Oxford and in some other areas of the city. The Science Area, in which most science departments are located, is the area that bears closest resemblance to a campus. There is a ten-acre (4-hectare) Radcliffe Observatory Quarter in the northwest of the city.\nIconic university buildings include the Radcliffe Camera, the Sheldonian Theatre used for music concerts, lectures, and university ceremonies, and the Examination Schools, where examinations and some lectures take place. The University Church of St Mary the Virgin was used for university ceremonies before the construction of the Sheldonian.\nIn 2012\u20132013, the university built the controversial one-hectare (400\u00a0m \u00d7 25\u00a0m) Castle Mill development of 4\u20135-storey blocks of student flats overlooking Cripley Meadow and the historic Port Meadow, blocking views of the spires in the city centre. The development has been likened to building a \"skyscraper beside Stonehenge\".\nParks.\nThe University Parks are a parkland area in the northeast of the city, near Keble College, Somerville College and Lady Margaret Hall. It is open to the public during daylight hours. There are also various college-owned open spaces open to the public, including Bagley Wood and most notably Christ Church Meadow.\nThe Botanic Garden on the High Street is the oldest botanic garden in the UK. It contains over 8,000 different plant species on . It is one of the most diverse yet compact major collections of plants in the world and includes representatives of over 90% of the higher plant families. The Harcourt Arboretum is a site south of the city that includes native woodland and of meadow. The Wytham Woods are owned by the university and used for research in zoology and climate change.\nOrganisation.\nColleges arrange the tutorial teaching for their undergraduates, and the members of an academic department are spread around many colleges. Though certain colleges do have subject alignments (e.g., Nuffield College as a centre for the social sciences), these are exceptions, and most colleges will have a diverse community of students and academics representing a wide range of disciplines. Facilities such as libraries are provided on all these levels: by the central university (the Bodleian), by the departments (individual departmental libraries, such as the English Faculty Library), and by colleges (each of which maintains a multi-discipline library for the use of its members).\nCentral governance.\nThe university's formal head is the chancellor, with Lord Hague of Richmond expected to be inaugurated in early 2025 although, as at most British universities, the chancellor is a titular figurehead and is not involved with the day-to-day running of the university. The chancellor is elected by the members of convocation, a body comprising all graduates of the university, and may hold office until death.\nThe vice-chancellor, currently Irene Tracey, is the \"de facto\" head of the university. There are five pro-vice-chancellors with specific responsibilities.\nTwo university proctors, elected annually on a rotating basis from any two of the colleges, are the internal ombudsmen who make sure that the university and its members adhere to its statutes. This role incorporates student discipline and complaints, as well as oversight of the university's proceedings. The university's professors are collectively referred to as the Statutory Professors of the University of Oxford. They are particularly influential in the running of the university's graduate programmes. Examples of statutory professors are the Chichele Professorships and the Drummond Professor of Political Economy.\nOxford is a \"public university\" in that it receives some public money from the government, but it is a \"private university\" in that it is entirely self-governing and, in theory, could choose to become entirely private by rejecting public funds.\nColleges.\nTo be a member of the university, all students, and most academic staff, must also be a member of a college or hall. There are thirty-nine colleges of the University of Oxford and four permanent private halls (PPHs), each controlling its membership and with its own internal structure and activities. Not all colleges offer all courses, but they generally cover a broad range of subjects.\nThe 39 colleges are:\n\u2021 These three have no royal charter, and are officially departments of the university rather than independent colleges.\nThe permanent private halls were founded by different Christian denominations. One difference between a college and a PPH is that whereas colleges are governed by the fellows of the college, the governance of a PPH resides, at least in part, with the corresponding Christian denomination. The four PPHs are:\nThe PPHs and colleges join as the Conference of Colleges, which represents their common concerns, to discuss matters of shared interest and to act collectively when necessary, such as in dealings with the central university. The Conference of Colleges was established as a recommendation of the Franks Commission in 1965.\nTeaching members of the colleges (i.e. fellows and tutors) are collectively and familiarly known as dons, although the term is rarely used by the university itself. In addition to residential and dining facilities, the colleges provide social, cultural, and recreational activities for their members. Colleges have responsibility for admitting undergraduates and organising their tuition; for graduates, this responsibility falls upon the departments.\nFinances.\nThe combined endowment figure of \u00a38.708\u00a0billion makes Oxford hold the largest endowment of any university in the UK. The college figure does not reflect all the assets held by the colleges as their accounts do not include the cost or value of many of their main sites or heritage assets such as works of art or libraries.\nThe central University's endowment, along with some of the colleges', is managed by the university's wholly owned endowment management office, Oxford University Endowment Management, formed in 2007. The university used to maintain substantial investments in fossil fuel companies. However, in April 2020, the university committed to divest from direct investments in fossil fuel companies and to require indirect investments in fossil fuel companies be subjected to the Oxford Martin Principles.\nThe university was one of the first in the UK to raise money through a major public fundraising campaign, the Campaign for Oxford. The current campaign, its second, was launched in May 2008 and is entitled \"Oxford Thinking \u2013 The Campaign for the University of Oxford\". This is looking to support three areas: academic posts and programmes, student support, and buildings and infrastructure; having passed its original target of \u00a31.25\u00a0billion in March 2012, the target was raised to \u00a33\u00a0billion.\nFunding criticisms.\nThe university has faced criticism for some of its sources of donations and funding. In 2017, attention was drawn to historical donations including All Souls College receiving \u00a310,000 from slave trader Christopher Codrington in 1710, and Oriel College receiving \u00a3100,000 from the will of the imperialist Cecil Rhodes in 1902. In 1996 a donation of \u00a320 million was received from Wafic Sa\u00efd who was involved in the Al-Yammah arms deal, and taking \u00a3150 million from the US billionaire businessman Stephen A. Schwarzman in 2019. The university has defended its decisions saying it \"takes legal, ethical and reputational issues into consideration\".\nThe university also faced criticism, as noted above, over its decision to accept donations from fossil fuel companies having received \u00a321.8 million from the fossil fuel industry between 2010 and 2015, \u00a318.8 million between 2015 and 2020 and \u00a31.6 million between 2020 and 2021.\nThe university accepted \u00a36 million from The Alexander Mosley Charitable Trust in 2021. Former racing driver Max Mosley stated that he set up the trust \"to house the fortune he inherited\" from his father, Oswald Mosley, who was founder of two far-right groups: Union Movement and the British Union of Fascists.\nAffiliations.\nOxford is a member of the Russell Group of research-led British universities and is regarded to be part of the non-formal grouping of universities which make up the \"golden triangle\" in South East England. Internationally, it is a member of the Europaeum, the League of European Research Universities, and the International Alliance of Research Universities.\nAcademic profile.\nAdmission.\nIn common with most British universities, prospective undergraduate students apply through the UCAS application system, but prospective applicants for the University of Oxford, along with those for medicine, dentistry, and University of Cambridge applicants, must observe an earlier deadline of 15 October. The Sutton Trust maintains that Oxford University and Cambridge University recruit undergraduates disproportionately from 8 schools which accounted for 1,310 Oxbridge places during three years, contrasted with 1,220 from 2,900 other schools.\nTo allow a more individualised judgement of students, who might otherwise apply for both, undergraduate applicants are not permitted to apply to both Oxford and Cambridge in the same year. The only exceptions are applicants for organ scholarships and those applying to read for a second undergraduate degree.\nOxford has the lowest offer rate of all Russell Group universities.\nMost applicants choose to apply to one of the individual colleges. Undergraduate applicants benefit from the collaborative efforts of the colleges, which aim to ensure that top students secure a place at the university, regardless of their initial college choices. Postgraduate applicants who are offered admission by the university are assured a place in one of the colleges, even if their preferred college cannot accommodate them.\nUndergraduate shortlisting is based on achieved and predicted exam results, school references, and, in some subjects, written admission tests or candidate-submitted written work. Approximately 60% of applicants are shortlisted, although this varies by subject. If a large number of shortlisted applicants for a subject choose one college, then students who named that college may be reallocated randomly to under-subscribed colleges for the subject. The colleges then invite shortlisted candidates for interview, where they are provided with food and accommodation for around three days in December. Most undergraduate applicants will be individually interviewed by academics at more than one college. In 2020 interviews were moved online, and they will remain online until at least 2027.\nUndergraduate offers are sent out in early January, with each offer usually being from a specific college. One in four successful candidates receives an offer from a college that they did not apply to. Some courses may make \"open offers\" to some candidates, who are not assigned to a particular college until A Level results day in August.\nThe university has come under criticism for the number of students it accepts from private schools; for instance, Laura Spence's rejection from the university in 2000 led to widespread debate. In 2016, the University of Oxford gave 59% of offers to UK students to students from state schools, while about 93% of all UK pupils and 86% of post-16 UK pupils are educated in state schools. However, 64% of UK applicants were from state schools and the university notes that state school students apply disproportionately to oversubscribed subjects. The proportion of students coming from state schools has been increasing. From 2015 to 2019, the state proportion of total UK students admitted each year was: 55.6%, 58.0%, 58.2%, 60.5% and 62.3%. Oxford University spends over \u00a36\u00a0million per year on outreach programs to encourage applicants from underrepresented demographics.\nIn 2018 the university's annual admissions report revealed that eight of Oxford's colleges had accepted fewer than three black applicants in the past three years. Labour MP David Lammy said, \"This is social apartheid and it is utterly unrepresentative of life in modern Britain.\" In 2020, Oxford had increased its proportion of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) students to record levels. The number of BAME undergraduates accepted to the university in 2020 rose to 684 students, or 23.6% of the UK intake, up from 558 or 22% in 2019; the number of Black students was 106 (3.7% of the intake), up from 80 students (3.2%). UCAS data also showed that Oxford is more likely than comparable institutions to make offers to ethnic minority and socially disadvantaged pupils.\nTeaching and degrees.\nUndergraduate teaching is centred on the tutorial, where 1\u20134 students spend an hour with an academic discussing their week's work, usually an essay (humanities, most social sciences, some mathematical, physical, and life sciences) or problem sheet (most mathematical, physical, and life sciences, and some social sciences). The university itself is responsible for conducting examinations and conferring degrees. Undergraduate teaching takes place during three eight-week academic terms: Michaelmas, Hilary and Trinity. (These are officially known as 'Full Term': 'Term' is a lengthier period with little practical significance.) Internally, the weeks in a term begin on Sundays, and are referred to numerically, with the initial week known as \"first week\", the last as \"eighth week\" and with the numbering extended to refer to weeks before and after term (for example \"noughth week\" precedes term). Undergraduates must be in residence from Thursday of 0th week. These teaching terms are shorter than those of most other British universities, and their total duration amounts to less than half the year. However, undergraduates are also expected to do some academic work during the three holidays (known as the Christmas, Easter, and Long Vacations).\nScholarships and financial support.\nThere are many opportunities for students at Oxford to receive financial help during their studies. The Oxford Opportunity Bursaries, introduced in 2006, are university-wide means-based bursaries available to any British undergraduate, with a total possible grant of \u00a310,235 over a 3-year degree. In addition, individual colleges also offer bursaries and funds to help their students. For graduate study, there are many scholarships attached to the university, available to students from all sorts of backgrounds, from Rhodes Scholarships to the relatively new Weidenfeld Scholarships. Oxford also offers the Clarendon Scholarship which is open to graduate applicants of all nationalities. The Clarendon Scholarship is principally funded by Oxford University Press in association with colleges and other partnership awards. In 2016, Oxford University announced that it is to run its first free online economics course as part of a \"massive open online course\" (MOOC) scheme, in partnership with a US online university network. The course available is called 'From Poverty to Prosperity: Understanding Economic Development'.\nStudents successful in early examinations are rewarded by their colleges with scholarships and exhibitions, normally the result of a long-standing endowment, although since the introduction of tuition fees the amounts of money available are purely nominal. Scholars, and exhibitioners in some colleges, are entitled to wear a more voluminous undergraduate gown; \"commoners\" (originally those who had to pay for their \"commons\", or food and lodging) are restricted to a short, sleeveless garment. The term \"scholar\" in relation to Oxford therefore has a specific meaning as well as the more general meaning of someone of outstanding academic ability. In previous times, there were \"noblemen commoners\" and \"gentlemen commoners\", but these ranks were abolished in the 19th century. \"Closed\" scholarships, available only to candidates who fitted specific conditions such as coming from specific schools, were abolished in the 1970s and 1980s.\nLibraries.\nThe university maintains the largest university library system in the UK, and, with over 11\u00a0million volumes housed on of shelving, the Bodleian group is the second-largest library in the UK, after the British Library. The Bodleian is a legal deposit library, which means that it is entitled to request a free copy of every book published in the UK. As such, its collection is growing at a rate of over three miles (five kilometres) of shelving every year.\nThe buildings referred to as the university's main research library, The Bodleian, consist of the original Bodleian Library in the Old Schools Quadrangle, founded by Sir Thomas Bodley in 1598 and opened in 1602, the Radcliffe Camera, the Clarendon Building, and the Weston Library. A tunnel underneath Broad Street connects these buildings, with the Gladstone Link, which opened to readers in 2011, connecting the Old Bodleian and Radcliffe Camera.\nThe Bodleian Libraries group was formed in 2000, bringing the Bodleian Library and some of the subject libraries together. It now comprises 28 libraries, a number of which have been created by bringing previously separate collections together, including the Sackler Library, Law Library, Social Science Library and Radcliffe Science Library. Another major product of this collaboration has been a joint integrated library system, OLIS (Oxford Libraries Information System), and its public interface, SOLO (Search Oxford Libraries Online), which provides an electronic catalogue covering all member libraries, as well as the libraries of individual colleges and other faculty libraries, which are not members of the group but do share cataloguing information.\nA new book depository opened in South Marston, Swindon, in October 2010, and recent building projects include the remodelling of the New Bodleian building, which was renamed the Weston Library when it reopened in 2015. The renovation is designed to better showcase the library's various treasures (which include a Shakespeare First Folio and a Gutenberg Bible) as well as temporary exhibitions.\nThe Bodleian engaged in a mass-digitisation project with Google in 2004. Notable electronic resources hosted by the Bodleian Group include the \"Electronic Enlightenment Project\", which was awarded the 2010 Digital Prize by the British Society for Eighteenth-Century Studies.\nMuseums.\nOxford maintains a number of museums and galleries, open for free to the public. The Ashmolean Museum, founded in 1683, is the oldest museum in the UK, and the oldest university museum in the world. It holds significant collections of art and archaeology, including works by Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Turner, and Picasso, as well as treasures such as the Scorpion Macehead, the Parian Marble and the Alfred Jewel. It also contains \"The Messiah\", a pristine Stradivarius violin, regarded by some as one of the finest examples in existence.\nThe University Museum of Natural History holds the university's zoological, entomological and geological specimens. It is housed in a large neo-Gothic building on Parks Road, in the university's Science Area. Among its collection are the skeletons of a \"Tyrannosaurus rex\" and \"Triceratops\", and the most complete remains of a dodo found anywhere in the world. It also hosts the Simonyi Professorship of the Public Understanding of Science, currently held by Marcus du Sautoy.\nAdjoining the Museum of Natural History is the Pitt Rivers Museum, founded in 1884, which displays the university's archaeological and anthropological collections, currently holding over 500,000 items. It recently built a new research annexe; its staff have been involved with the teaching of anthropology at Oxford since its foundation, when as part of his donation General Augustus Pitt Rivers stipulated that the university establish a lectureship in anthropology.\nThe Museum of the History of Science is housed on Broad Street in the world's oldest-surviving purpose-built museum building. It contains 15,000 artefacts, from antiquity to the 20th century, representing almost all aspects of the history of science. In the Faculty of Music on St Aldate's is the Bate Collection of Musical Instruments, a collection mostly of instruments from Western classical music, from the medieval period onwards. Christ Church Picture Gallery holds a large collection of old master paintings and drawings.\nPublishing.\nThe Oxford University Press is the world's second oldest and currently the largest university press by the number of publications. More than 6,000 new books are published annually, including many reference, professional, and academic works (such as the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", the \"Concise Oxford English Dictionary\", the \"Oxford World's Classics\", the \"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\", and the \"Concise Dictionary of National Biography\").\nReputation and ranking.\nDue to its age and its social and academic status, the University of Oxford is considered to be one of Britain's most prestigious or elite universities and to form, along with the University of Cambridge, a top two that stand above other UK universities in this regard.\nOxford is regularly ranked within the top five universities in the world in the \"Times Higher Education World University Rankings\", as well as the Forbes's World University Rankings. It held the number one position in the \"Times Good University Guide\" for eleven consecutive years, and the medical school has also maintained first place in the \"Clinical, Pre-Clinical &amp; Health\" table of the \"Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings\" for the past seven consecutive years. In 2021, it ranked sixth among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings. The \"THE\" has also recognised Oxford as one of the world's \"six super brands\" on its \"World Reputation Rankings\", along with Berkeley, Cambridge, Harvard, MIT, and Stanford. The university is fourth worldwide on the \"US News\" ranking. Its Sa\u00efd Business School came 13th in the world in \"Financial Times\" \"Global MBA Ranking\".\nOxford was ranked 13th in the world in 2022 by the Nature Index, which measures the largest contributors to papers published in 82 leading journals. It is ranked fifth best university worldwide and first in Britain for forming CEOs according to the , and first in the UK for the quality of its graduates as chosen by the recruiters of the UK's major companies.\nIn the 2018 Complete University Guide, all 38 subjects offered by Oxford rank within the top 10 nationally meaning Oxford was one of only two multi-faculty universities (along with Cambridge) in the UK to have 100% of their subjects in the top 10. Computer Science, Medicine, Philosophy, Politics and Psychology were ranked first in the UK by the guide.\nAccording to the QS World University Rankings by Subject, the University of Oxford also ranks as number one in the world for four Humanities disciplines: English Language and Literature, Modern Languages, Geography, and History. It also ranks second globally for Anthropology, Archaeology, Law, Medicine, Politics &amp; International Studies, and Psychology.\nStudent life.\nTraditions.\nAcademic dress is required for examinations, matriculation, disciplinary hearings, and when visiting university officers. A referendum held among the Oxford student body in 2015 showed 76% against making it voluntary in examinations \u2013 8,671 students voted, with the 40.2% turnout the highest ever for a UK student union referendum. This was widely interpreted by students as being a vote not so much on making subfusc voluntary, but, in effect, on abolishing it by default, in that if a minority of people came to exams without subfusc, the rest would soon follow. In July 2012 the regulations regarding academic dress were modified to be more inclusive to transgender people.\n'Trashing' is a tradition of spraying those who just finished their last examination of the year with alcohol, flour and confetti. The sprayed student stays in the academic dress worn to the exam. The custom began in the 1970s when friends of students taking their finals waited outside Oxford's Examination Schools where exams for most degrees are taken. Other traditions and customs vary by college. For example, some colleges have formal hall six times a week, but in others this only happens occasionally, or even not at all. \"Balls\" are major events held by colleges; the largest, held triennially in ninth week of Trinity Term, are known as commemoration balls; the dress code is usually white tie. Many other colleges hold smaller events during the year that they call summer balls or parties. \nClubs and societies.\nThe Oxford Union (distinct from Oxford University Student Union) is an independent debating society which hosts weekly debates and high-profile speakers. Party political groups include Oxford University Conservative Association and Oxford University Labour Club. Most academic areas have student societies of some form, for example the Scientific Society.\nThere are two weekly student newspapers: the independent \"Cherwell\" and OUSU's \"The Oxford Student\". Other publications include the \"Isis\" magazine, the satirical \"Oxymoron\", the graduate \"Oxonian Review\", the \"Oxford Political Review\", and the online only newspaper \"The Oxford Blue\". The student radio station is Oxide Radio.\nSport is played between college teams, in tournaments known as cuppers (the term is also used for some non-sporting competitions). In particular, much attention is given to the termly intercollegiate rowing regattas: Christ Church Regatta, Torpids, and Summer Eights. In addition, there are higher standard . Significant focus is given to annual varsity matches played against Cambridge, the most famous of which is The Boat Race, watched by a TV audience of between five and ten million viewers. A blue is an award given to those who compete at the university team level in certain sports.\nMusic, drama, and other arts societies exist both at the collegiate level and as university-wide groups, such as the Oxford University Dramatic Society and the Oxford Revue. Most colleges have chapel choirs. The Oxford Imps, a comedy improvisation troupe, perform weekly at The Jericho Tavern during term time.\nPrivate members' clubs for students include Vincent's Club (primarily for sportspeople) and The Gridiron Club. A number of invitation-only student dining clubs also exist, including the Bullingdon Club.\nStudent union and common rooms.\nThe Oxford University Student Union, formerly better known by its acronym OUSU and now rebranded as Oxford SU, exists to represent students in the university's decision-making, to act as the voice for students in the national higher education policy debate, and to provide direct services to the student body. Reflecting the collegiate nature of the University of Oxford itself, OUSU is both an association of Oxford's more than 21,000 individual students and a federation of the affiliated college common rooms, and other affiliated organisations that represent subsets of the undergraduate and graduate students.\nThe importance of collegiate life is such that for many students their college JCR (Junior Common Room, for undergraduates) or MCR (Middle Common Room, for graduates) is seen as more important than OUSU. JCRs and MCRs each have a committee, with a president and other elected students representing their peers to college authorities. Additionally, they organise events and often have significant budgets to spend as they wish (money coming from their colleges and sometimes other sources such as student-run bars).\nNotable alumni.\nThroughout its history, a sizeable number of Oxford alumni, known as Oxonians, have become notable in many varied fields, both academic and otherwise. More than 70 Nobel prize-winners have studied or taught at Oxford, with prizes won in all six categories.\nMore information on notable members of the university can be found in the individual college articles. An individual may be associated with two or more colleges, as an undergraduate, postgraduate or member of staff.\nNotable alumni include three Fields Medallists, two British kings and at least fifteen monarchs of eleven other sovereign states (including five reigning monarchs), twenty-eight British prime ministers, and thirty-five presidents and prime ministers of nineteen other countries. As of July 2019 there are seven Oxonians in the Cabinet of the United Kingdom and two in the Shadow Cabinet.\nThe university has produced 291 Members of Parliament (excluding MPs who were subsequently peers), eleven Members of the European Parliament (excluding MEPs also serving at Westminster), twelve Lord Chancellors, nine Lord Chief Justices and twenty-two law lords; ten US Senators, ten US Representatives (including a Speaker of the House), three state governors, and four associate justices of the US Supreme Court; as well as six puisne justices of the Supreme Court of Canada and a chief justice of the now defunct Federal Court of Canada.\nOxford in literature and popular media.\nThe University of Oxford is the setting for numerous works of fiction. Oxford was mentioned in fiction as early as 1400 when Chaucer, in \"Canterbury Tales\", referred to a \"Clerk [student] of Oxenford\". Mortimer Proctor argues the first campus novel was \"The Adventures of Oxymel Classic, Esq; Once an Oxford Scholar\" (1768). It is filled with violence and debauchery, with obnoxious, foolish dons becoming easy prey for cunning students. Proctor argues that by 1900, \"novels about Oxford and Cambridge were so numerous that they clearly represent a striking literary phenomenon.\" By 1989, 533 novels based in Oxford had been identified and the number continues to rise.\nFamous literary works range from \"Brideshead Revisited\" by Evelyn Waugh, which in 1981 was adapted as a television serial, to the trilogy \"His Dark Materials\" by Philip Pullman, which features an alternate-reality version of the university and was adapted for film in 2007 and as a BBC television series in 2019.\nOther notable examples include:\nNotable non-fiction works on Oxford include \"Oxford\" by Jan Morris.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of 2021, the university had over 4,000 employees and 19,000 students. It was established by an act of parliament in 1946 consolidating several scientific institutions that dated as far back as 1825. It is Norway's second-oldest university, and is considered to be one of the nation\u2019s four so-called \"established universities.\" It has faculties and programmes in all the academic fields typical of a classical university, as well as such degree programmes as medicine and law that, traditionally, only the \u201cestablished universities\u201d are authorized by law to offer. It is also one of Norway's leading universities in many of the natural sciences, including marine research and climate research. It has consistently been ranked in the top 200 or top one percent of universities in the world, and as one of the best 10 or best 50 universities worldwide in some fields, such as earth and marine sciences. It is part of the Coimbra Group and of the U5 group of Norway's oldest and highest-ranked universities.\nHistory.\nThe university traces its roots to several earlier scientific and scholarly institutions founded in Bergen. Academic activity had taken place in Bergen since the founding of Bergen Cathedral School in 1153, the Seminarium Fredericianum in 1750 and the establishment of the Royal Norwegian Naval Academy in 1817. Academia and higher education would also be significantly advanced in the city with the establishment of Bergen Museum, later renamed \"University Museum of Bergen\", in 1825. Founded by Wilhelm Frimann Christie and Jacob Neumann, the museum became a venue for both research and education specialized on natural science, and featured prominent researcher like Michael Sars, Daniel Cornelius Danielssen and Fridtjof Nansen.\nBergen eventually became a city with several arenas for higher education and research with the Geophysical Institute being established in 1917, the Chr. Michelsen Institute in 1930, the Norwegian School of Economics in 1936 and finally the university in 1946. The University of Bergen was established by an act of parliament in 1946, as Norway's second university.\nOrganization.\nThe University of Bergen has an elected rector. The current rector is Margareth Hagen, who was elected for a four-year term starting 1 August 2021 after serving as interim rector.\nThe university has 7 faculties, the newest being \"The Faculty of Fine Art, Music and Design\" which was established in 2017. The University of Bergen Library and the University Museum of Bergen have a faculty-like status.

{"id": "31800", "revid": "50354403", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31800", "title": "University of Oslo", "text": "Norwegian public research university\nThe University of Oslo (; ) is a public research university located in Oslo, Norway. It is the oldest university in Norway. Originally named the Royal Frederick University, the university was established in 1811 as the de facto Norwegian continuation of Denmark-Norway's common university, the University of Copenhagen, with which it shares many traditions. It was named for King Frederick VI of Denmark and Norway, and received its current name in 1939. The university was commonly nicknamed \"The Royal Frederick's\" (\"Det Kgl. Frederiks\") before the name change, and informally also referred to simply as \"Universitetet\" (lit.\u2009'the university'). \nThe university was the only university in Norway until the University of Bergen was founded in 1946. It has approximately 27,700 students and employs around 6,000 people. Its faculties include (Lutheran) theology (with the Lutheran Church of Norway having been Norway's state church since 1536), law, medicine, humanities, mathematics, natural sciences, social sciences, dentistry, and education. The university's original neoclassical campus is located in the centre of Oslo; it is currently occupied by the Faculty of Law. Most of the university's other faculties are located at the newer Blindern campus in the suburban West End. The Faculty of Medicine is split between several university hospitals in the Oslo area. The university also includes some formally independent, affiliated institutes such as the Centre for International Climate and Environmental Research (CICERO), NKVTS\u00a0and the Frisch Centre. \nThe Nobel Peace Prize was awarded in the university's Atrium, from 1947 to 1989 and in 2020. Since 2003, the Abel Prize is awarded in the Atrium. Five researchers affiliated with the university have been Nobel laureates and three have been Turing Award winners.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nIn 1811, a decision was made to establish the first university in the Dano-Norwegian Union, after an agreement was reached with King Frederik VI, who had earlier believed that such an institution might encourage political separatist tendencies. In 1813, The Royal Frederik's University was founded in Christiania (now Oslo), a small city at that time. Circumstances then changed dramatically one year into the commencement of the university, as Norway proclaimed independence. However, independence was somewhat restricted, as Norway was obliged to enter into a personal union with Sweden based on the outcome of the Swedish-Norwegian War of 1814. Norway retained its own constitution and independent state institutions, although royal power and foreign affairs were shared with Sweden. At a time when Norwegians feared political domination by the Swedes, the new university became a key institution that contributed to Norwegian political and cultural independence.\nThe main initial function of The Royal Frederick University was to educate a new class of upper-echelon civil servants, as well as parliamentary representatives and government ministers. The university also became the centre for a survey of the country\u2014a survey of culture, language, history and folk traditions. The staff of the university strove to undertake a wide range of tasks necessary for developing a modern society. Throughout the 1800s, the university's academic disciplines gradually became more specialised.\nOne of the major changes in the university came during the 1870s when a greater emphasis was placed upon research, the management of the university became more professional, academic subjects were reformed, and the forms of teaching evolved. Classical education came under increasing pressure.\nWhen the union with Sweden was dissolved in 1905, the university became important for producing highly educated experts in a society which placed increasing emphasis on ensuring that all its citizens enjoy a life of dignity and security. Education, health services and public administration were among those fields that recruited personnel from the university's graduates.\n1900\u20131945.\nResearch changed qualitatively around the turn of the century as new methods, scientific theories and forms of practice changed the nature of research. It was decided that teachers should arrive at their posts as highly qualified academics and continue academic research alongside their role as teachers. Scientific research\u2014whether to launch or test out new theories, to innovate or to pave the way for discoveries across a wide range of disciplines\u2014became part of the increased expectations placed on the university. Developments in society created a need for more and more specialised and practical knowledge, not merely competence in theology or law, for example. The university strove to meet these expectations through increasing academic specialisation.\nThe position of rector was established by Parliament in 1905 following the Dissolution of the Union. Waldemar Christofer Br\u00f8gger was Professor of Geology and became the university's first rector. Br\u00f8gger vacillated between a certain pessimism and a powerfully energetic attitude regarding how to procure finances for research and fulfill his more general funding objectives. With the establishment of the national research council after World War II, Br\u00f8gger's vision was largely fulfilled; research received funding independent of teaching. This coincided with a massive rise in student enrollment during the 1960s, which again made it difficult to balance research with the demands for teaching. In the years leading up to 1940, research was more strongly linked with the growth of the nation, with progress and self-assertion; research was also seen to contribute to Norway's commitment to international academic and cultural development.\nDuring the period after World War I, research among Norwegian researchers resulted in two Nobel prizes. The Nobel prize in Economics was awarded to Ragnar Frisch. The Nobel prize in Chemistry was awarded to Odd Hassel. In the field of linguistics, several Norwegian researchers distinguished themselves internationally. Increased research activity during the first half of the 1900s was part of an international development that also included Norway. Student enrollment doubled between 1911 and 1940, and students were recruited from increasingly broad geographical, gender and social bases. The working class was still largely left behind, however.\nDuring the German occupation, which lasted from 1940 to 1945, the university rector, Didrik Arup Seip, was imprisoned. The university was then placed under the management of Adolf Hoel, a NS (Norwegian Nazi Party) appointee. A number of students participated in the Norwegian resistance movement; after fire was set in the university auditorium, Reich Commissar Terboven ordered the university closed and the students arrested. A number of students and teachers were detained by the Germans nearly until the end of the war.\n1945\u20132000.\nAfter WWII, public authorities made loans available to students whose families were unable to provide financial assistance; the State Educational Loan Fund for Young Students was established in 1947. As a result, the post-war years saw a record increase in student numbers. Many of these students had been unable to begin their studies or had seen their studies interrupted because of the war; they could now enroll. For the 1945 autumn semester, 5951 students registered at the university. This represented the highest student enrollment at UiO up to that time. In 1947, the number had risen to more than 6000 students. This represented a 50 per cent increase in the number of students compared to the number enrolled before the war.\nIn no prior period had one decade brought so many changes for the university as the 1960s. The decade represented an unparalleled period of growth. From 1960 to 1970, student enrollment tripled, rising from 5,600 to 16,800. This tremendous influx would have been enough in itself to transform the way the university was perceived, from both the inside and the outside. As it turned out, the changes were even more comprehensive. The university campus at Blindern was expanded, and the number of academic and administrative employees rose. The number of academic positions doubled, from fewer than 500 to around 1,200. The increase in the number of students and staff transformed traditional forms of work and organisation. The expansion of the Blindern complex allowed the accommodation of 7,000 students. The explosive rise in student numbers during the 1960s impacted the Blindern campus in particular. The faculties situated in central Oslo\u2014Law and Medicine\u2014experienced only a doubling in student enrollment during the 1960s, while the number of students in the humanities and social sciences tripled.\nBy 1968, revolutionary political ideas had taken root in earnest among university students. The \"Student Uprising\" became a turning point in the history of universities throughout the western world. Often, the outlook for students in the 1960s was bleak. More than ever before came from non-academic backgrounds and had few role models. The \"University of the Masses\" was unable to lift all its students to the \"lofty, elite positions\" enjoyed by prior generations of academics. Many students dissociated themselves, therefore, from the so-called \"establishment\" and from the way it functioned. Many were impatient and wanted to use their knowledge to change society. It was thought that academics should stand in solidarity with the underprivileged.\nThe most fundamental change in the student population was the increasing proportion of female students. Throughout the 1970s, the number of women increased until it made up the majority of students. At the same time, the university became a centre for the organised women's liberation movement, which emerged in the 1970s.\nUp until the millennium, the number of students enrolled at the university rose exponentially. In 1992, UiO implemented a restriction on admissions for all of its faculties for the first time. A large part of the explanation for the high student numbers was thought to be found in the poor job market. In 1996, there were 38,265 students enrolled at UiO. This level was approximately 75 per cent above the average during the 1970s and 1980s. The strong rise in student numbers during the 1990s was attributed partly to the poor labour market.\nHierarchy.\nThe highest position at the university is Professor, i.e. \"full Professor.\" In Norway, the title \"Professor,\" which is protected by law, is only used for full professors. Before 1990, all professors were appointed for life to their chairs by the King-in-Council, i.e. by the King upon the advice of the Cabinet. The position below Professor was historically Docent (translated as Reader in a UK context and Professor in an American context). In 1985, all Docents became full professors. The most common positions below that are \"f\u00f8rsteamanuensis\" (translated as Associate Professor), and \"amanuensis\" or \"universitetslektor\" (translated as Lecturer or Assistant Professor). At the University of Oslo, almost all new permanent positions are announced at the Associate Professor level; an associate professor may apply for promotion to full professor if he or she holds the necessary competence.\nAdditionally, there are temporary, qualifying positions such as \"stipendiat\" (Research Fellow) and \"postdoktor\" (Postdoctoral Fellow).\nA small number of employees with few or no teaching obligations hold the special research career pathway ranks \"researcher\", \"senior researcher\" and \"research professor\", which correspond to assistant professor, associate professor and professor, respectively.\nSeveral other less common academic positions also exist. Historically, only professors had the right to vote and be represented in the governing bodies of the university. Originally, all professors were automatically members of the \"Collegium Academicum\", the highest governing body of the university, but soon afterwards its membership was limited. Docents were granted the right to vote and be represented in 1939 and other academics and students in 1955. In 1975, the technical-administrative support staff was also granted the right to vote and be represented in certain bodies, as the last group. Formerly by law, and now by tradition, the highest positions, such as Rector or Dean, are only held by professors. They are elected by the academic community (academics and students) and by the technical-administrative support staff, but the votes of the academics carry significantly more weight.\nFaculties.\nThe university's research structure consists of eight schools, or \"faculties.\" They are the Faculties of Dentistry, Educational Sciences, Humanities, Law, Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Medicine, Social Sciences and Theology.\nThe university's old campus, strongly influenced by Prussian architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel's neoclassical style, is located in the centre of Oslo near the National Theatre, the Royal Palace and the Parliament. The old campus was then occupied by the Faculty of Law and most of the other faculties have been transferred to the Blindern campus in the suburban West End, erected in the 1930s. The Faculty of Medicine is split between several university hospitals in the Oslo area.\nTheology.\nThe Faculty of Theology sponsors 8 research groups in the following fields:\nMedicine.\nCentres of Excellence:\nHumanities.\nThe Faculty of Humanities is the University of Oslo's largest faculty, and has approximately 8000 students and 917 employees.\nOther units.\nThe University of Oslo has several units which are not part of one of the faculties, including some interdisciplinary research centres, research centres abroad, the scientific museums, and libraries:\nAffiliated institutes.\nAffiliated institutes are independent institutes that have a formal cooperation agreement with and close ties to the University of Oslo. Most of them were established by the University of Oslo, but have been organised as entities formally separate from the university for various reasons.\nNotable people.\nThe University of Oslo has a long list of notable academics and alumni, spanning the fields of scholarship covered by the university. The university is home to five Nobel Prize winners and is institutionally tied to some of the most prestigious prizes in the world. The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded in the university's atrium between 1947 and 1989, thus making it the only university to host a Nobel Prize ceremony. Since 2003, the Abel Prize is awarded in the university's atrium.\nAcademics.\nSome of the notable academics of the university are:\nSeal.\nThe seal of the University of Oslo features Apollo with the Lyre, and dates from 1835. The seal has been redesigned several times, most recently in 2009.\nFees.\nLike all public institutions of higher education in Norway, the university does not charge tuition fees. However, a small fee of 600\u00a0kr (roughly US$) per term goes to the student welfare organisation Foundation for Student Life in Oslo, to subsidise kindergartens, health services, housing and cultural initiatives, the weekly newspaper \"Universitas\" and the radio station Radio Nova.\nIn addition the students are charged a copy and paper fee of 200\u00a0kr (roughly US$) for full-time students and 100\u00a0kr (roughly US$) for part-time students. Lastly a voluntary sum of 40\u00a0kr (roughly US$) is donated to SAIH (Studentenes og Akademikernes Internasjonale Hjelpefond).\nRankings.\nIn 2023, Shanghai Jiao Tong University's Academic Ranking of World Universities ranked UiO 73rd worldwide and the best in Norway, while the 2024 Times Higher Education World University Rankings ranked UiO 127th and the 2024 rankings of the QS World University Rankings ranked UiO 117th worldwide. The 2022 Webometrics Ranking of World Universities ranked UiO 94th worldwide.\nThe 2022 rankings of the Center for World University Rankings (CWUR), which \"publishes the only global university ranking that measures the quality of education and training of students as well as the prestige of the faculty members and the quality of their research without relying on surveys and university data submissions\", ranked UiO 99th worldwide.\nInternational cooperation.\nThe University of Oslo administers the Henrik Steffens Professorship at the Humboldt University of Berlin jointly with the Humboldt University. The professorship was established and is funded by the Norwegian government.\nThe university participates to several of the experiments in the CERN research programme.\nUiO is an active member of the University of the Arctic. UArctic is an international cooperative network based in the Circumpolar Arctic region, consisting of more than 200 universities, colleges, and other organizations with an interest in promoting education and research in the Arctic region.\nTransport.\nUniversitet Blindern is a tram stop on the Ullev\u00e5l Hageby Line and it is near the university. The Blindern metro station, is only near the university.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Despite some contemporary building developments further away from the centre, Uppsala's historic centre continues to be dominated by the presence of the university.\nHistory.\n15th century: Origins.\nAs with most medieval universities, Uppsala University initially grew out of an ecclesiastical centre. The archbishop of Uppsala had been one of the most important sees in Sweden proper since Christianity first spread to this region in the ninth century. Uppsala had also long been a hub for regional trade and had contained settlements dating back into the deep Middle Ages. As was also the case with most medieval universities, Uppsala had initially been chartered through a papal bull. Uppsala's bull, which granted the university its corporate rights, was issued by Pope Sixtus IV in 1477 and established several provisions. Among the most important of these was that the university was officially given the same freedoms and privileges as the University of Bologna. This included the right to establish the four traditional faculties of theology, law (Canon Law and Roman law), medicine, and philosophy, and to award the bachelor's, master's, licentiate, and doctoral degrees. The archbishop of Uppsala was also named as the university's Chancellor and was charged with maintaining the rights and privileges of the university and its members.\n16th century: Turbulent times.\nThe turbulent period of the reformation of King Gustavus Vasa resulted in a drop in the already relatively insignificant number of students in Uppsala, which was seen as a centre of Catholicism and potential disloyalty to the Crown. Swedish students generally travelled to one of the Protestant universities in Germany, especially Wittenberg. There is some evidence of academic studies in Uppsala during the 16th century; the Faculty of Theology is mentioned in a document from 1526, King Eric XIV appointed Laurentius Petri Gothus (later archbishop) rector of the university in 1566, and his successor and brother John III appointed several professors in the period 1569\u20131574. At the end of the century, the situation had changed, and Uppsala became a bastion of Lutheranism, which Duke Charles, the third of the sons of Gustavus Vasa to eventually become king (as Charles IX) used to consolidate his power and eventually oust his nephew Sigismund III Vasa from the throne. The Uppsala Synod in 1593 established Lutheran orthodoxy in Sweden, and Charles and the Council of state gave new privileges to the university on 1 August of the same year.\nTheology still had precedence, but in the privileges of 1593, the importance of a university to educate secular servants of the state was also emphasized. Three of the seven professorial chairs which were established were in Theology; of the other four, three were in Astronomy, Physics (or general natural sciences) and Latin eloquence. A fourth chair was given to Ericus Jacobi Skinnerus, who was also appointed rector, but whose discipline was not mentioned in the charter. Of the professors, several were taken over from the Collegium regium Stockolmense in Stockholm, which had been functioning for a few years but closed in 1593. An eighth chair, in Medicine, was established in 1595 but received no appointee for several years. In 1599 the number of students was approximately 150. In 1600 the first post-reformation conferment of degrees took place. In the same year, the antiquarian and mystic Johannes Bureus designed and engraved the seal of the university, which is today used as part of the logotype.\n17th century: Expansion.\nThe medieval university had mainly been a theology school. The aspirations of the emergent new great power of Sweden demanded a different kind of learning. Sweden both grew through conquests and went through a complete overhaul of its administrative structure. It required a much larger class of civil servants and educators than before. Preparatory schools, gymnasiums, were also founded during this period in various cathedral towns, notably V\u00e4ster\u00e5s (the first one) in 1623. Besides Uppsala, new universities were founded in more distant parts of the Swedish Realm, the University of Dorpat (present-day Tartu) in Estonia (1632) and the Royal Academy of Turku in Finland (1640). After the Scanian provinces were taken from Denmark, Lund University was founded in 1666.\nInstrumental in the reforms of the early 17th-century Swedish state was the long-dominant Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna, who had spent his own student days in German universities and who for the last years before his death was also chancellor of the university. King Gustavus Adolphus showed the university a keen interest and increased the professorial chairs from eight to thirteen in 1620, and again to seventeen in 1621. In 1624 the king donated \"for all eternity\" all his own inherited personal property in the provinces of Uppland and V\u00e4stmanland, some 300 farms, mills and other sources of income. The king's former private tutor, Johan Skytte, who was made chancellor of the university in 1622, donated the Skyttean chair in Eloquence and Government which still exists. The university received a stable structure with its constitution of 1626. The head of the university was to be the chancellor, and his deputy was the \"pro-chancellor\" (always the archbishop \"ex officio\"). The immediate rule was the responsibility of the consistory, to which belonged all the professors of the university, and the rector magnificus, who was elected for a semester at the time; the latter position circulated among the professors, each of whom sometimes held it several times.\nDuring the late 16th and early 17th centuries (and perhaps even earlier), the university was located in the old chapter house parallel to the south side of the cathedral, later renamed the \"Academia Carolina\". In 1622\u20131625 a new university building was built east of the cathedral, the so-called \"Gustavianum\", named after the reigning king. In the 1630s, the total number of students was about one thousand.\nQueen Christina was generous to the university, gave scholarships to Swedish students to study abroad and recruited foreign scholars to Uppsala chairs, among them several from the University of Strasbourg, notably, the philologist Johannes Schefferus (professor Skytteanus), whose little library and museum building at \"St Eriks torg\" now belongs to the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala. The Queen, who would eventually declare her abdication in the great hall of Uppsala Castle, visited the university on many occasions; in 1652 she was present at an anatomical demonstration arranged at the castle for the young physician Olaus Rudbeck. Rudbeck, one of several sons of Johannes Rudbeckius, a former Uppsala professor who became Bishop of V\u00e4ster\u00e5s, was sent for a year to the progressive Leiden University in the Netherlands. Returning in 1654, he received an assistantship in Medicine 1655 and had already gone to work on a program for improving aspects of the university. He planted the first botanical garden, the one which would eventually be tended by Carl Linnaeus and is kept today as a museum of 18th-century botany under the name \"Linn\u00e9tr\u00e4dg\u00e5rden\" (\"the Linnaean Garden\"). With the patronage of the university chancellor Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie, Rudbeck was made full professor in 1660, was elected rector for two terms, despite his youth, and started a revision of the work of the other professors and a building spree with himself as an architect. His most significant remaining architectural work is the anatomical theatre, which was added to Gustavianum in the 1660s and crowned with the characteristic cupola for which the building is today known.\nA gifted scientist, architect and engineer, Rudbeck was the dominant personality of the university in the late 17th century who laid some of the groundwork for Linnaeus and others, but he is perhaps more known today for the pseudohistorical speculations of his \"Atlantica\", which consumed much of his later life. When large parts of Uppsala burned down in 1702, Gustavianum, which contained the university library and its many valuable manuscripts, escaped the fire; local lore has it that the ageing Rudbeck stood on the roof directing the work of fighting the fire.\n18th century: Enlightenment and mercantilism.\nThe early part of the 18th century was still characterized by the combination of Lutheran orthodoxy and classical philology of the previous century, but eventually, a larger emphasis on sciences and practically useful knowledge developed. The innovative mathematician and physicist Samuel Klingenstierna (1698\u20131765) was made a professor in 1728, the physicist and astronomer Anders Celsius in 1729, and Carl Linnaeus was made professor of medicine with botany in 1741. The university was not immune to the parliamentary struggle between the parties known as the \"Hats\" and the \"Caps,\" with the former having a preference for hard sciences and practical knowledge. The Hat government then in power established a chair in economics (\"\u0152conomia publica\") in 1741 and called Anders Berch as its first incumbent. This was the first professorship in economics outside Germany, and possibly the third in Europe (the first chairs having been established in the Martin Luther University of Halle and European University Viadrina in 1727). In 1759, following a donation, another chair in the economy was established, the Borgstr\u00f6mian professorship in \"practical economy,\" which meant the practical application of the natural sciences for economic purposes (it eventually developed into a chair for physiological botany).\nThere were very radical attempts at reforms which were never implemented, but important changes took place. University studies had until this time been very informal in their overall organization, with the all-purpose \"philosophi\u00e6 magister\"-degree being the only one frequently conferred and many never graduating, as there was no degree applicable to their intended area of work (and well-connected aristocratic students often not graduating as they did not need to). A few professional degrees for various purposes were introduced in 1749\u20131750, but the radical suggestion of binding students to a single program of study adapted to a particular profession was never implemented. The reforms of this era have been compared to those of the 1960s and 1970s (Sten Lindroth).\nAlthough it took some time after the fire of 1702, Uppsala Cathedral and Uppsala Castle were both eventually restored, both by Carl H\u00e5rleman, perhaps the most important Swedish architect of the era. He also modified Gustavianum, designed a new conservatory for Linnaeus' botanical garden and built the new Consistory house, which was to be the administrative core of the university.\nAnother magnificent royal donation was that of the large baroque garden of the castle, given by Gustav III to the university when it was obvious that the old botanical garden was insufficient. A large new conservatory was built by the architect Louis Jean Desprez. Additional grounds adjacent to the baroque garden have since been added. The old garden of Rudbeck and Linnaeus was largely left to decay but was reconstructed in the years between 1918 and 1923 according to the specifications of Linnaeus in his work \"Hortus Upsaliensis\" from 1745.\nWomen at the university.\nThe issue of women's right to study at universities was raised during the very last session of the estate parliament in 1865 in a motion from Carl Johan Svens\u00e9n, a member of the farmers' estate. This was preceded by the foundation of the Royal Seminary for women and the progressive transformation of the education at private girls schools to become more and more similar to that of boys. \nThe reception was mixed, with the most negative views coming from the clergy. In the following years, the issue continued to be debated at the universities. The Flickskolekommitt\u00e9n 1866 (Girl's School Committee of 1866) recommended that women be given access to study, considering the fact that not all women could marry and even some educated women should have access to education to be able to support themselves professionally. \nIn 1870, it was decided to let women take the secondary school examination (\"studentexamen\") that gave the right to entry at universities and the right to study and complete degrees at the faculties of Medicine in Uppsala and Lund and at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. A common view was that female sensitivity and compassion would make women capable of working as physicians, but their right to work was still restricted to private practice. Women's rights to higher education were extended in 1873 when all degrees except those in the faculties of theology and the licentiate degree in Law were made accessible for women.\nThe first female student in Sweden was Betty Pettersson (1838\u20131885), who had already worked as a private tutor for several years when she took \"studentexamen\" in 1871. With a royal dispensation, she was allowed to enter university in Uppsala in 1872, the year before studies at the Philosophical faculty would actually be made generally available to women. She studied modern European languages and was the first woman in Sweden to complete an academic degree when she finished a film. kand. in 1875. She became the first woman to be employed as a teacher in a public school for boys. The first woman in Sweden to complete a doctoral degree was Ellen Fries (1855\u20131900), who entered Uppsala university in 1877 and became a PhD in history in 1883. Other female students of this period include Lydia Wahlstr\u00f6m (1869\u20131954) who later became a noted educator, activist and writer on women's emancipation and suffrage. Defending a dissertation in history in 1900, she became the second woman to finish a doctorate at a Swedish university. In 1892, she founded the Uppsala Women's Student Association, which set up spex performances and other things enjoyed by male students but from which the women were excluded at the time. The members of the Association were the first woman to wear student caps in public, an important sign of their status. Elsa Eschelsson (1861\u20131911) was the first Swedish woman to finish a law degree and the first to become a \"docent,\" but was not permitted to even hold the position of acting professor despite being formally qualified for this in everything but her sex. After years of conflicts with the professor of civil law A. O. Winroth, who wrote the paper on \"Om tjenstehjonsf\u00f6rh\u00e5llandet\" and with the university board, she died in 1911 from an overdose of sleeping powder.\nAccording to the constitution of 1809, only \"native Swedish men\" could be appointed to higher civil servant positions, including professorships. This was changed by the Beh\u00f6righetslagen in 1925, and the first woman to hold a professorial chair at Uppsala University was Gerd Enequist, appointed professor of human geography in 1949.\nHildegard Bj\u00f6rck who studied at the university became the first Swedish woman to receive an academic degree.\nAdministration and organisation.\nCentral administration.\nThe governing board of the university is the consistory, with representatives of the faculties as well as members representing the students and non-academic employees (three professors and three students), and ten university outsiders appointed by the Swedish government. All these members in the consistory have the right to vote.\nThe unions active at the university also have three representatives in the consistory; these members have the right to speak but not any right to vote.\nSince the last reorganization in 1999, the university has had a separate body called the \"academic senate\", which is a wider, but mostly advisory group representing teaching staff/researchers and students. The executive head of the university is the \"rector magnificus\", whose deputy is the \"prorector\". There are (also since 1999) three vice rectors, each heading one of the three \"disciplinary domains\" (Arts and Social Sciences, Medicine and Pharmacy, and Science and Technology) into which the nine faculties are divided. Each faculty has a faculty board and is headed by a dean (\"dekanus\"). The position of dean is held part-time by a professor of the faculty.\nFaculties.\nThrough the division of faculties and the addition of a previously independent school of Pharmacy as a new faculty, the traditional four-faculty organization of European universities has evolved into the present nine faculties. The disciplinary domains and their faculties are as depicted below.\nOther.\nUppsala University also hosts the Forum for South Asia Studies, a collaborative academic effort by its six faculties: Theology, Law, History and Philosophy, Social Sciences, Languages, and Educational Sciences. The Forum aims to facilitate and promote research and education related to the South Asian countries: India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh, Maldives and Afghanistan, on the national and international level, with Ferdinando Sardella, Faculty of Theology, serving as the Forum's director.\nUniversity Library.\nThe university library holds about 5.25 million volumes of books and periodicals (131,293 shelf meters), 61,959 manuscripts, 7,133 music prints, and 345,734 maps and other graphic documents. The holdings of the collection of manuscripts and music include, among other things, the Gothic Bible manuscript Codex Argenteus.\nThe most widely recognized building of the university library is Carolina Rediviva, the \"revived Carolina,\" thus named in reference to \"Academia Carolina\" (see illustration), which held the university library from the earliest times until 1691, when it was moved to the upper floor of Gustavianum, where it miraculously survived the great city fire of 1702. In the mid-18th century, there were plans to move it back to Academia Carolina or a new building in the same spot. The building was demolished in 1778 to make place for a new library, but this was never built and the area next to the cathedral where it stood is today a lawn. The present Carolina Rediviva was built in a different place and completed in 1841.\nThe present university library system comprises 19 branches, including the one in the Carolina building.\nUppsala University Hospital.\nThe Uppsala Academic Hospital or \"Akademiska sjukhuset\", which functions as a teaching hospital for the Faculty of Medicine and the Nursing School, is run by the Uppsala County Council in cooperation with the university. As of 2003[ [update]], the hospital had 7,719 employees and as of 2004[ [update]] 1,079 places for patients.\nThe university hospital is actually older than the university, as it goes back to the earliest hospital, founded in Uppsala in 1302, and much later merged with the university clinic. This was used for 400 years until the great fire of 1702 which destroyed large parts of central Uppsala. A new hospital, which later became the Uppsala county hospital, was built in its place but was moved out of the town in 1811.\nThe first clinic with the specific intention to facilitate the practical education of medical students was the \"Nosocomium Academicum\", founded in 1708 and located at the Oxenstierna Palace at Riddartorget beside the cathedral (see illustration above). The building (the former residence of the president of the Royal Chancellery Bengt Gabrielsson Oxenstierna) today houses the Faculty of Law.\nThe present \"Akademiska sjukhuset\" was founded in 1850 as an organizational merger of the county hospital and the university clinic, and a new building was inaugurated in 1867 on the hill below Uppsala Castle to the southeast. From this building, which is still in use, the present hospital complex has grown.\nThe Svedberg Laboratory.\nThe Svedberg Laboratory (named after Theodor Svedberg) is a university facility that contains the \"Gustaf Werner cyclotron\", which is used for research as well as for proton therapy for the treatment of cancer with close cooperation with the oncology clinic at Uppsala University Hospital. Such an accelerator and its gantries costs between $60 million and $100 million, and makes Uppsala University Hospital one of the approximately 40 centres in the world to provide such cancer treatment.\nLecture Series.\nAt the Department of Philosophy.\nH\u00e4gerstr\u00f6m Lectures.\nThe H\u00e4gerstr\u00f6m Lectures are a yearly series of talks by prominent philosophers hosted by the Department of Philosophy at Uppsala University. \nThe initiative for the H\u00e4gerstr\u00f6m Lectures was taken by Stig Kanger, Chair Professor of Theoretical Philosophy at Uppsala University, from 1968 until his death in 1988. The idea was to invite a distinguished philosopher for a week to give a series of five open lectures unified by a common theme, and provide an opportunity for teachers and students at the Department of Philosophy in Uppsala to meet the guest for informal discussions. The series was inaugurated in 1971 and named in honor of the former Chair in Practical Philosophy (1911\u20131933), Axel H\u00e4gerstr\u00f6m, the founding father of the Uppsala School of ethics and the jurisprudential movement known as Scandinavian Legal Realism. The H\u00e4gerstr\u00f6m Lectures were held annually until 2009, biannually between 2009 and 2022, and have been held annually again since 2022. From 2017 onward, the number of lectures each year has been reduced from five to three. \nThe first H\u00e4gerstr\u00f6m Lecturer was Konrad Marc-Wogau, Kanger\u2019s predecessor as Chair in Theoretical Philosophy at Uppsala University (1946\u20131968). The list of speakers since then includes several of the most eminent and influential philosophers of the last half century in a broad range of areas of specialization, including Julia Annas, Alonzo Church, Donald Davidson, Peter Geach, Ian Hacking, Christine Korsgaard, Saul Kripke, John McDowell, Martha Nussbaum, Hilary Putnam, Judith Jarvis Thomson, Willard Van Orman Quine, Wlodek Rabinowicz, Amartya Sen, Patrick Suppes, Kendall Walton, Timothy Williamson and Georg Henrik von Wright. \nStudent life.\nNations and student union.\nUp until June 2010, students at Uppsala University were obliged to become members of one of the nations, corporations of students traditionally according to the province of origin (not strictly upheld now, for practical reasons). The system of dividing students into nations according to origin can ultimately be traced back to the nations at the medieval University of Paris and other early medieval universities, but the Uppsala nations appear only about 1630\u20131640, most likely under influence of the \"Landsmannschaften\" which existed at some of the German universities visited by Swedish students. In Sweden, nations exist only in Uppsala and Lund. The nations were originally seen as subversive organisations promoting less virtuous aspects of student life, but in 1663 the consistory made membership in a nation legal, each nation being placed under the inspectorship of a professor.\nThe current thirteen nations all have a history stretching back to the early-to-mid 17th century, but some of them are the result of mergers of older, smaller nations that took place in the early 19th century to facilitate the financing of building projects.\nThe nations at Uppsala University are:\nSince the 1960s there is a fourteenth nation, the \"Sk\u00e5nelandens nation\" (referring to the Scanian lands) which has no membership fee and exists as a legal device to get around the compulsory membership for students who prefer not to become affiliated with the traditional nations. However, this nation was made redundant in 2010, when membership in a nation ceased to be mandatory.\nThe Uppsala Student Union was founded in 1849 as a corporation representing all students, irrespective of nation. The pharmaceutical institute became integrated in Uppsala university during 1968 and formed the Faculty of Pharmacy at Uppsala University, and the pharmaceutical educations moved to Uppsala university during 1972. At the same time, the Pharmaceutical Student Union (Pharmaceutical Association of Uppsala Students) became a Student Union at Uppsala University. The students at the faculty of Pharmacy were also exempt from compulsory membership in the nations, but most pharmacy students belonged to one. However, they were obliged to take up membership in the Pharmaceutical Student Union, an organisation having the same role as the nations and Uppsala Student union at the rest of the university.\nThe compulsory membership in a student union was abolished on 1 July 2010; however, the unions will still be representing organisations in the university boards and committees. The status as a student union will be decided upon by the university board for periods of three years at a time. On 20 February 2013, the university board decided that there will be four student unions at the university from July 2013 \u2013 June 2016: the Uppsala Student Union (for students at the faculties of Art, Social Sciences, Languages, Theology, Law, Educational Sciences and Medicine), the Pharmaceutical Student Union (for students at the Faculty of Pharmacy), the Uppsala Union of Engineering and Science Students (at the Faculty of Science and Technology), and Rindi (the union for students at Campus Gotland). In February 2016, two additional associations were given the status as student unions: Uppsala Business &amp; Economics Students Association (for students of economics) and Uppsala Law Student Associations (for students of law). Thus, there are now six student unions at Uppsala university.\nMusic.\nThe University's Royal Academic Orchestra was founded in 1627. Its main purpose is to play at academic ceremonies but holds concerts on other occasions as well. Its leader has the title of \"director musices\". The position has been held by composers such as Wilhelm Stenhammar, Hugo Alfv\u00e9n and Lars-Erik Larsson. Affiliated with the university are three choirs, the mixed Uppsala University Choir (\"Allm\u00e4nna S\u00e5ngen\"), founded in 1830, the male choir Orphei Dr\u00e4ngar, founded in 1853, and the Academy Chamber Choir of Uppsala, founded in 1957. A number of other choirs and orchestras are affiliated with the nations.\nAn important name in the recent history of the choirs is Eric Ericson, who was the conductor of both Orphei Dr\u00e4ngar and the Chamber Choir. In honour of Ericson, the F\u00f6reningsSparbanken endowed the Eric Ericson Chair in Choral Directing, and the Uppsala University Choral Centre was inaugurated in 2000. The centre arranges courses in choral directing. Uppsala universitets K\u00f6rcentrum\nHousing crisis.\nLike many cities, there is a shortage of housing in Uppsala, a problem which has existed for many years. Both native Swedes and foreign students are finding it difficult to find accommodation when first enrolling on the university. This problem is however not as bad as it was with several major housing construction projects having been completed after 2010.\nThere has never been a custom in Sweden for the universities to arrange housing for students, in fact, universities are by law not allowed to own housing. Students are expected to set their own living accommodations on the private market. To make it easier for students to find moderately priced housing, special student rooms and student apartments have been built by the student nations and student unions. However, the student housing is insufficient to accommodate all students. About 40,000 students are eligible to live in the 11,000 available rooms and apartments. Because of the low rent in these apartments and the general lack of housing in Uppsala the student apartments are highly attractive and many try to hold on to the contracts as long as possible even after graduating.\nHousing.\nSome of the most popular housing accommodations for students are Flogsta, Kantorsgatan, Studentstaden, Studentv\u00e4gen, Klostergatan, Rackarbergsgatan and many more.\nFlogsta is one of the international students' biggest and most popular housing choices.\nAthletics.\nSports play a very small role in the life of the university, compared to British and especially U.S. universities, but have existed in various forms since the early 17th century. Uppsala University is more noted for its musical and choral traditions. Both have partial roots in the 17th-century institution of extracurricular exercises for students from the nobility.\nThe.\nTo ease the recruitment of students from the nobility, the university started in the 1630s to offer training in a number of or \"exercises\" (Swedish: ) deemed necessary for the well-rounded education of a young nobleman: riding, fencing, dance, drawing and modern languages such as French and Italian. The initiative came from Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna, who saw the value in a well-educated class of civil servants and the danger to his own class if its members would fall behind in academic education compared to those students who came from the lower estates. An \"exercise yard,\" built for the riding and fencing exercises, was demolished in the late 19th century to give place to the new University Hall. Modern languages were made part of the regular academic curriculum in the 19th century. The surviving \"exercises\" include:\nOther sports.\nBesides the , other sports have had a presence in Uppsala student life. The Upsala Sims\u00e4llskap, \"Uppsala Swimming Society,\" which is the oldest swimming club in the world, was founded in 1796 by the mathematician J\u00f6ns Svanberg. It had no formal connection to the university, but all its earliest members came from academic life. Svanberg even arranged a mock graduation ceremony, a \"simpromotion\", in a parody of the university ceremonies, where those who had graduated from its swimming training were awarded \"degrees\" of master (\"magister\") and bachelor (\"kandidat\"). These degrees stuck, and Swedish swimming schools still use these degrees for different levels of swimming skills.\nAn attempt was made in the 1870s to introduce academic rowing after the Oxbridge model. The Stockholms Nation acquired a rowing boat in 1877, soon followed by the G\u00f6teborgs nation, and for a number of years rowing competitions were held between teams from the two nations. Although rowing never got the strong position it has at the English universities, an annual Uppsala-Lund regatta has been arranged since 1992, between rowing teams from Uppsala and Lund University. The race is held on the Fyris River in Uppsala on even years, and on a river in the vicinity of Lund on odd years. Each year there is at least one full eight crew with cox competing, with both men's and women's teams present. With the recent victory for Uppsala in 2005, the score stands 24\u201323 in Uppsala's favour.\nRankings.\nOverall Rankings.\nUppsala University is one of the most prominent universities in Sweden and is commonly ranked within the top 100 in the world by several ranking agencies. For example, for over ten years, it has been ranked among the 80 best universities in the world in the Academic Ranking of World Universities. \nTimes Higher Education ranked Uppsala the 101\u2013125th most reputable university worldwide in 2023 and the 68th most international university in the world in 2023.\nNotable people.\nUppsala University is associated with 8 Nobel Prize laureates, and numerous royalty, academics and public figures.\nAs the dominant academic institution in Sweden for several centuries, Uppsala University has educated a large proportion of Swedish politicians and civil servants ever since its first period of expansion in the early part of the 17th century. These range from Chancellor of the Realm (\"rikskansler\") Johan Oxenstierna (1611\u20131657) and Lord Chief Justice (\"riksdrots\") Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie (1622\u20131686) to the first Social Democratic Prime Minister of Sweden, Hjalmar Branting (1860\u20131925). Other alumni are Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld (1905\u20131961), United Nations Secretary General who was (posthumously) awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1961, and the Swedish diplomat Hans Blix (born 1928), who was Head of the International Atomic Energy Agency 1981\u20131997, of the UNMOVIC 2000\u20132003, and previously Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs 1978\u20131979. Hammarskj\u00f6ld and Blix both graduated from the Uppsala Faculty of Law, as did the Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs Anna Lindh, who was assassinated in 2003.\nMost Swedish clergymen, including most bishops and archbishops, have been educated at the university, including, in more recent times, Nathan S\u00f6derblom (1866\u20131931), Professor of the History of Religions in the Faculty of Theology, later Archbishop of Uppsala, and awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1930 for his work as leader of the ecumenical movement.\nThe university became prominent in the sciences in the 18th century with names such as the physician and botanist Carl Linnaeus (1707\u20131778), the father of biological and mineralogical taxonomy, and his numerous important pupils, the physicist and astronomer Anders Celsius (1701\u20131744), inventor of the Celsius scale the predecessor of the Celsius scale, and the chemist Torbern Bergman (1735\u20131784). Another scientist from this era is Emanuel Swedenborg (1688\u20131772), better remembered today as a religious mystic. The university played an important role in the Swedish agricultural revolution of the 18th century; Jacob Faggot, the initiator of the reforms, studied at Uppsala. Several of the elements were discovered by Uppsala scientists during this period or later. J\u00f6ns Jakob Berzelius, one of the fathers of modern chemistry, received his doctorate in medicine in Uppsala in 1804, but later moved to Stockholm. Uppsala scientists of the 19th century include the physicist Anders Jonas \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m (1814\u20131874). During the 20th century, several Nobel laureates in the sciences have been Uppsala alumni or professors at the university.\nMany well-known Swedish writers have studied in Uppsala: Georg Stiernhielm (1598\u20131672) is often called the father of Swedish poetry. The poet and song composer Carl Michael Bellman (1740\u20131795), without doubt, the best-loved and best-remembered Swedish 18th-century poet, matriculated but left the university after less than a year. The writer, historian and composer Erik Gustaf Geijer (1783\u20131847), professor of history, and the poet Per Daniel Amadeus Atterbom (1790\u20131855), professor of poetry, were principal figures of early 19th-century Swedish romanticism. The less than happy experiences of the Uppsala student life of novelist and playwright August Strindberg (1849\u20131912), resulted in his \"Fr\u00e5n Fj\u00e4rdingen och Svartb\u00e4cken\" (1877), a collection of short stories set in Uppsala (\"From Fj\u00e4rdingen and Svartb\u00e4cken,\" the title refers to two districts in Uppsala). Other Uppsala alumni are the poet Erik Axel Karlfeldt (1864\u20131931), who refused the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1918 but received it posthumously in 1931, the novelist and playwright P\u00e4r Lagerkvist (1891\u20131974), Nobel laureate in 1951, and the poet and novelist Karin Boye (1900\u20131941), for whom one branch of the university library has been named. The Communist leader Ture Nerman (1886\u20131969) wrote a novel called \"Olympen\", based on his experience as a student in Uppsala.\nInternational cooperation.\nUppsala University has signed student exchange agreements with about 400 universities across all parts of the world. It takes part in the Erasmus programme and the Nordplus programme. It also benefits from its membership in the Coimbra Group of universities.\nIn May 2010 Uppsala joined the Matariki Network of Universities (MNU) together with Dartmouth College (USA), Durham University (UK), Queen's University (Canada), University of Otago (New Zealand), University of T\u00fcbingen (Germany), and University of Western Australia (Australia).\nIn fiction and popular culture.\nAlong with Lund, Uppsala is the historic and traditional centre of Swedish academic life, making it a popular object of reference in Swedish literature, art, and film. Specifically, Uppsala University has appeared notably in \"M\u00e4n som hatar kvinnor\" or \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" by Stieg Larsson.\nThe Norwegian pop singer Kirsti Sparboe dedicated one of her biggest successes to Uppsala University, publishing in 1969 the song \"Ein Student aus Uppsala\". The song, originally written in German, lasted 14 weeks in the German charts.\nUppsala University appears as a research centre in the strategy game \"\".\nUppsala University appears in the novel \"S.\" by Doug Dorst and J. J. Abrams. The fictional author V. M. Straka of \"Ship of Theseus\" sends Mr. Grahn a confidential letter on Uppsala Universitet letterhead and stamps his signature with \"Straka Uppsala Arkiv\" (included as an insert to the book).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31802", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31802", "title": "Universal access to education", "text": "Ability of all people to have equal opportunity in education\nUniversal access to education is the ability of all people to have equal opportunity in education, regardless of their social class, race, gender, sexuality, ethnic background or physical and mental disabilities. The term is used both in college admission for the middle and lower classes, and in assistive technology for the disabled. Some critics feel that this practice in higher education, as opposed to a strict meritocracy, causes lower academic standards. In order to facilitate the access of education to all, countries have right to education.\nUniversal access to education encourages a variety of pedagogical approaches to accomplish the dissemination of knowledge across the diversity of social, cultural, economic, national and biological backgrounds. Initially developed with the theme of equal opportunity access and inclusion of students with learning or physical and mental disabilities, the themes governing universal access to education have now expanded across all forms of ability and diversity. However, as the definition of diversity is within itself a broad amalgamation, teachers exercising universal access will continually face challenges and incorporate adjustments in their lesson plan to foster themes of equal opportunity of education.\nAs universal access continues to be incorporated into the U.S. education system, professors and instructors at the college level are required (in some instances by law) to rethink methods of facilitating universal access in their classrooms. Universal access to college education may involve the provision of a variety of different assessment methods of learning and retention. For example, in order to determine how much of the material was learned, a professor may enlist multiple methods of assessment. Methods of assessment may include a comprehensive exam, unit exams, portfolios, research papers, literature reviews, an oral exam or homework assignments. Providing a variety of ways to assess the extent of learning and retention will help identify the gaps in universal access and may also elucidate the ways to improve universal access.\nAs part of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, Universal Education for All (EFA) children were adopted according to the United Nations in 1989. The limitation of education existed for students living with disabilities despite international declarations.\nNon-discrimination and equality in education.\nHuman rights are internationally recognized as universal rights, therefore meaning it applies to everyone equally and without discrimination. However, a significant number of individuals miss out on education due to discrimination preventing access to education.\nDiscrimination occurs most prominently in terms of accessing education. For example, girls can face gender-based barriers such as child marriage, pregnancy, and gender-based violence which often prevent them from going to school or contribute to them dropping-out of school. People with disabilities often face literal accessibility issues, such as a lack of ramps or insufficient school transportation, making it more difficult to get to school. Migrants often face administrative barriers that prevent them from enrolling, effectively barring them from education systems. \nGirls are dropped out of school to assist their families with domestic labour. Due to limited resources, sons are sent to school rather than girls.. Uniforms, tuition fees, textbooks, teacher salaries and school maintenance are part of hindrances to education. Poverty is a significant barrier accessing education. In sub-Saharan Africa, children from the richest 20% of households reach ninth grade at eleven times the rate of those from the poorest 40% of households.\nHowever, discrimination also occurs within education systems when certain groups receiving an inferior quality of education compared with others, for instance, the quality of education in urban schools tends to be higher than that found in rural areas. \nDiscrimination also happens after education where different groups of people are less likely to draw the same benefits from their schooling. For example, educated boys tend to leave school with higher wage potential than equally educated girls.\nNon-discrimination and equality provisions found in international human rights law (IHRL) exist to ensure that the principle that international human rights are universal is applied in practice. Non-discrimination and equality are not abstract concepts under international human rights law (IHRL). They are elaborated human rights that have been developed over decades to address the discrimination that people face daily. Particularly education where the rights to non-discrimination and equality have been applied to the right to education across numerous human rights treaties, including one dedicated to the issue, known as UNESCO Convention against Discrimination in Education. \nDespite the strength of non-discrimination and equality law, eliminating discrimination and inequalities is a challenge that individual states and the international community face. This was acknowledged in 2015 when the international community vowed to 'leave no one behind'. \nInternational and regional human rights treaties apply the rights to non-discrimination and equality to the right to education of specific marginalised groups. Marginalized groups are those who have suffered prolonged and historical discrimination, usually, but not exclusively, on the basis of identity (gender, for example), characteristics (ethnicity, race), or circumstance (refugees, migrants, internally displaced persons). Marginalized groups are very likely to be subject to multiple, compound, or intersectional forms of discrimination.\nExamples of marginalised groups include:\nAccess to education in racial minorities.\nIn the context of post-secondary education, there exists a lack of access to education that disproportionately affects minority students. The number of students who pursue higher education heavily relies on the number of students that graduate from high school. Since the late 1970s, the rate in which young adults between the ages of 25 and 29 years old have graduated from high school and received a diploma or the equivalent has stagnated between 85 and 88 percent. In terms of race, there is a statistical gap between minority groups' rates of graduation and white students' rates of graduation. In 2006, the rate of high school graduation was 93 percent, for Black students was 86 percent, and for Hispanic students was 63 percent.\nAlthough minority college attendance has increased throughout the years, the disparity has remained. In terms of completing high school, in 2010, white (47 percent) and Asian (66 percent) students were more likely to have graduated from high school. In comparison, only 39 percent of Pacific Islanders, 37 percent of Black students, 31 percent of Hispanics, and 28 percent of Native Americans completed high school. This transfers over to the numbers of students in minority groups who have enrolled in college, even though these students have great aspirations to attend college. When examining enrollment numbers, Black (23 percent) and Hispanic (19 percent) students enrolled into and attended 2-year and 4-year universities at lower rates, compared to white (45 percent), Asian (53 percent), and multiracial (37 percent) students. However, Black and Hispanic students are more likely to enroll into 2-year universities.\nCauses of disparities.\nThe disparity in access to higher education is primarily due to a difference in college readiness these students experience. College readiness refers to how prepared for higher education students are. Although there are several ways to define it, college readiness involves measuring four aspects of student performance: basic skills, knowledge of certain content areas, grade point averages (GPA), and college knowledge, also referred to as social capital. Basic skills include being able to read, write and think analytically about situations; content areas that students should have knowledge of include English and mathematics. Both aspects are crucial to college readiness because of their real-world application, and if a student is not proficient in these two areas, they are less likely to even pursue university. However, for many minority students they do not meet the basic requirements for colleges and universities.\nIn terms of GPA and college knowledge, racial disparities exist. Regarding GPA, the gap in school performance between minority and white students is significant. This gap can influence minority students' aspirations towards attending college, which affects minority enrollment rates. In terms of college knowledge, many minority students do not have access to social capital because of the lack of resources catered to them to ensure their success. There also is a lack of knowledge among minority students about what resources are available, especially because many of them are first-generation students.\nWork towards better access.\nAlthough racial disparities in college readiness exist, there are several ways to counteract them. One way involves the way that students' communities support them. Their counselors, teachers, and parents must work with them to ensure that their school records, academic records, and such are accurately conveyed to colleges and universities. Other crucial factors that would contribute to higher rates of minority enrollment include encouraging students through policies and rewards for focusing on information pertaining to college, providing schools with the necessary resources, and cultivating the classroom environment to be encouraging of students' skills so that they are better prepared for college. Organizations like the National Association for College Admission Counseling should also be more aware of this issue as well as do more to bring more attention to these disparities. Changes also must occur on an institution level for minority students to better succeed.\nPrograms like the ones developed at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County work towards eliminating disparities in higher education access in minority students. Their programs mostly focus on minorities having better access and getting more involved in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. One program, the Meyerhoff Scholars Program, aids students by addressing the social capital aspect college readiness. This program connects students to financial resources as well as academic and social support, and they also receive research opportunities and connect with on-campus staff members. Other programs like the ACTiVATE program and the Partnerships for Innovation Program have stemmed from the Meyerhoff Scholars Program. These have pushed minority students towards success in accessing and completing post-secondary education, especially in STEM fields. Other programs across the country have also aided minority students in succeeding in higher education.\nAccess to education by law.\nIn 2009, both the houses of the Indian Parliament and the President of India both signed and approved a bill that would grant free, legally-mandated education for children ages six to fourteen. It was considered a major step towards universal education for all. Muchkund Dubey author of the article \"The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 : The Story of Missed Opportunity\" discusses and highlights the issues of access, quality of education, financial implication, and discrimination.\nIn the United States, Brown vs. Board of Education was a landmark decision because it found and declared that, \"separate educational facilities are inherently unequal\". This began the process of desegregation in many schools that had not desegregated yet. The significance of Brown vs. Board was the universal right of all students to attend educational institutions equally rather than using racial segregation to separate students. Jonathan Kozol, author of The Shame of the Nation, talks about how \"physical conditions in these newly integrated schools were generally more cheerful\u2026state of mind among the teachers and the children [was] more high-spirited\" in the aftermath of desegregation.\nUniversal access.\nUniversal Access to education is defined as having equal opportunities to take part in any educational system. However, some individuals, groups, or ethnic groups face barriers to equal access. The United States is credited with the current idea of universal access as a concern for handicapped persons. Two international agencies (World Health Organization and World Bank) estimated that around one billion people all over the world have various types of disabilities. Between 93 and 150 million of them are children. Plan International revealed that these kids are less likely to attend school, and if enrolled, they are often separated from their peers. The Global Partnership for Education said approximately 90 percent of children with disabilities from low and middle income nations are out of school. Historically, these students have been excluded from the ordinary education system and referred to special learning schools.\nDespite all improvements made, education up to this day is inaccessible to millions of schoolchildren globally. Over 72 million children of primary education age are out of school, and around 759 million adults are uneducated. They do not have the resources for developing the situation of themselves, their families, and their countries. Poverty leads to lack of education. In almost all countries (developing and developed), children face barriers to education as a result of inequalities that emanate from health, gender, and cultural identity like religion, language, and ethnic origin. Factors associated with poverty include unemployment, illiteracy among parents, and ailments increase the possibility of non-schooling and dropout rates. Universal primary education is widely known as a major issue for many nations. The majority of these developing states do not possess the financial resources needed to build schools, provide books and other materials, and recruit, train, and pay teachers. The Sub-Saharan African region is the most affected region in the world as roughly 32 million African children are still uneducated. This is followed by Central and East Asia as well as the Pacific with over 27 million children uneducated. However, observers noted that universal access to education remains an attainable goal by 2030.\nSources.\n\u00a0This article incorporates text from a free content work.

Founded in 1546 by King Henry VIII, Trinity is one of the largest Cambridge colleges, with the largest financial endowment of any college at Oxford or Cambridge. Trinity has some of the most distinctive architecture in Cambridge with its Great Court said to be the largest enclosed courtyard in Europe. Academically, Trinity performs exceptionally as measured by the Tompkins Table (the annual unofficial league table of Cambridge colleges), coming top from 2011 to 2017, and regaining the position in 2024. \nMembers of Trinity have been awarded 34 Nobel Prizes out of the 121 received by members of the University of Cambridge (more than any other Oxford or Cambridge college). Members of the college have received four Fields Medals, one Turing Award and one Abel Prize. Trinity alumni include Francis Bacon, six British prime ministers (the highest number of any Cambridge college), physicists Isaac Newton, James Clerk Maxwell, Ernest Rutherford and Niels Bohr, mathematicians Srinivasa Ramanujan and Charles Babbage, poets Lord Byron and Lord Tennyson, English jurist Edward Coke, writers Vladimir Nabokov and A. A. Milne, historians Lord Macaulay and G. M. Trevelyan, and philosophers Ludwig Wittgenstein and Bertrand Russell (who the college expelled before reaccepting). Two members of the British royal family have studied at Trinity and been awarded degrees: Prince William of Gloucester and Edinburgh, who gained an MA in 1790, and King Charles III, who was awarded a lower second class BA in 1970.\nTrinity's many college societies include the Trinity Mathematical Society, the oldest mathematical university society in the United Kingdom, and the First and Third Trinity Boat Club, its rowing club, which gives its name to the May Ball. Along with Christ's, Jesus, King's and St John's colleges, it has provided several well-known members of the Cambridge Apostles, an intellectual secret society. In 1848, Trinity hosted a meeting at which Cambridge undergraduates representing fee-paying private schools codified a set of early rules of football known as the Cambridge rules. Trinity's sister college is Christ Church, Oxford. Trinity has been linked with Westminster School since the school's re-foundation in 1560, and its Master is an \"ex officio\" governor of the school.\nHistory.\nFoundation.\nThe college was founded by Henry VIII in 1546 with the name \"College of the Holy and Undivided Trinity within the Town and University of Cambridge of King Henry the Eighth's Foundation\", from the merger of two existing colleges: Michaelhouse (founded by Hervey de Stanton in 1324), and King's Hall (established by Edward II in 1317 and refounded by Edward III in 1337). At the time, Henry had been seizing (Catholic) church lands from abbeys and monasteries. The universities of Oxford and Cambridge, being both religious institutions and quite rich, expected to be next in line. The King duly passed an Act of Parliament that allowed him to suppress (and confiscate the property of) any college he wished. The universities used their contacts to plead with his sixth wife, Catherine Parr. The Queen persuaded her husband not to close them down, but to create a new college. The king did not want to use royal funds, so he instead combined two colleges (King's Hall and Michaelhouse) and seven hostels to form Trinity.\nNevile's expansion.\nThe monastic lands granted by Henry VIII were not on their own sufficient to ensure Trinity's eventual rise. In terms of architecture and royal association, it was not until the Mastership of Thomas Nevile (1593\u20131615) that Trinity assumed both its spaciousness and its association with the governing class that distinguished it since the Civil War. In its infancy Trinity had owed a great deal to its neighbouring college of St John's: in the words of Roger Ascham, Trinity was a \"colonia deducta\".\nMost of Trinity's major buildings date from the 16th and 17th centuries. Thomas Nevile, who became Master of Trinity in 1593, rebuilt and redesigned much of the college. This work included the enlargement and completion of Great Court and the construction of Nevile's Court between Great Court and the river Cam. Nevile's Court was completed in the late 17th century with the Wren Library, designed by Christopher Wren. Nevile's building campaign drove the college into debt from which it surfaced only in the 1640s, and the Mastership of Richard Bentley adversely affected applications and finances. Bentley himself was notorious for the construction of a hugely expensive staircase in the Master's Lodge and for his repeated refusals to step down despite pleas from the Fellows. Besides, despite not being a sister college of Trinity College Dublin, as is the case with St John's College, Cambridge, it is believed that the Irish institution takes its name from this college, which was the \"alma mater\" of its first provost, Adam Loftus and, likewise, from Trinity College, Oxford.\nModern day.\nIn the 20th century, Trinity College, St John's College and King's College were for decades the main recruiting grounds for the Cambridge Apostles, an elite, intellectual secret society. In 2011, the John Templeton Foundation awarded Trinity College's Master, the astrophysicist Martin Rees, its controversial million-pound Templeton Prize, for \"affirming life's spiritual dimension\". Trinity is the richest Oxbridge college with a landholding alone worth \u00a3800\u00a0million. For comparison, the second richest college in Cambridge (St John's) has estimated assets of around \u00a3780\u00a0million, and the richest college in Oxford (Magdalen) has about \u00a3940\u00a0million.\nIn 2005, Trinity's annual rental income from its properties was reported to be in excess of \u00a320\u00a0million. The college owns:\nIn 2018, Trinity revealed that it had investments totalling \u00a39.1 million in companies involved in oil and gas production, exploration and refinement. These included holdings of \u00a31.2 million in Royal Dutch Shell, \u00a31.7 million in Exxon Mobil and \u00a31 million in Chevron. In 2019, Trinity confirmed its plan to withdraw from the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS), the main pre-1992 UK University pension provider. In response, more than 500 Cambridge academics signed an open letter undertaking to \"refuse to supervise Trinity students or to engage in other discretionary work in support of Trinity's teaching and research activities\". On 17 February 2020, protestors from the campaign group Extinction Rebellion dug up the front lawn of Trinity College to protest against the College's investments in fossil fuels and its negotiations to sell off a farm in Suffolk that was to be turned into a lorry park.\nLegends.\nLord Byron purportedly kept a pet bear whilst living in the college. Trinity is also often cited as the inventor of an English version of cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, known as \"Trinity burnt cream\".\nTrinity in Camberwell.\nTrinity College has a long-standing relationship with the Parish of St George's, Camberwell, in South London. Students from the College have helped to run holiday schemes for children from the parish since 1966. The relationship was formalised in 1979 with the establishment of Trinity in Camberwell as a registered charity.\nBuildings and grounds.\nGreat Gate.\nThe Great Gate is the main entrance to the college, leading to the Great Court. A statue of the college founder, Henry VIII, stands in a niche above the doorway. In 1983, Trinity College undergraduate Lance Anisfeld, then Vice-President of CURLS (Cambridge Union Raving Loony Society), replaced the chair leg with a bicycle pump. Once discovered the following day, the college removed the pump and replaced it with another chair leg. The original chair leg was auctioned off by TV Presenter Chris Serle at a Cambridge Union Society charity raffle in 1985. In 2023, the college replaced the chair leg with a sceptre to mark the 75th birthday of Charles III, an alumnus of the college. In 1704, the University's first astronomical observatory was built on top of the gatehouse. Beneath the founder's statue are the coats of arms of Edward III, the founder of King's Hall, and those of his five sons who survived to maturity, as well as William of Hatfield, whose shield is blank as he died as an infant, before being granted arms.\nGreat Court.\nGreat Court (built 1599\u20131608) was the brainchild of Thomas Nevile, who demolished several existing buildings on this site, including almost the entirety of the former college of Michaelhouse. The sole remaining building of Michaelhouse was replaced by the then current Kitchens (designed by James Essex) in 1770\u20131775. The Master's Lodge is the official residence of the Sovereign when in Cambridge. King's Hostel (built 1377\u20131416) is located to the north of Great Court, behind the clock tower. This is, along with the King's Gate, the sole remaining building from King's Hall. Bishop's Hostel (built 1671) is a detached building to the southwest of Great Court, and named after John Hacket, Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry. Additional buildings were built in 1878 by Arthur Blomfield.\nNevile's Court.\nNevile's Court (built 1614) is located between Great Court and the river. It was created by a bequest by the college's master, Thomas Nevile, originally two-thirds of its current length and without the Wren Library. The court was extended and the appearance of the upper floor remodelled slightly in 1758 by James Essex. Cloisters run around the court, providing sheltered walkways from the rear of Great Hall to the college library and reading room as well as the Wren Library and New Court.\nThe Wren Library (built 1676\u20131695, Christopher Wren) is located at the west end of Nevile's Court, the Wren is one of Cambridge's most famous and well-endowed libraries. Among its notable possessions are two of Shakespeare's First Folios, a 14th-century manuscript of The Vision of Piers Plowman, letters written by Sir Isaac Newton, and the Eadwine Psalter. Below the building are the pleasant Wren Library Cloisters, where students may enjoy a fine view of the Great Hall in front of them, and the river and Backs directly behind.\nSince the completion of the Wren Library in 1695, a number of prominent portraits have been displayed within its walls, including those of Arthur James Balfour, John Hacket, Isaac Barrow, William Lamb, and Thomas Nevile. As of November 2024, the portrait of Balfour was temporarily relocated to an undisclosed location in Cambridge after being vandalised by an activist associated with the group Palestine Action. Trinity College stated that revealing the painting's current location or restoration studio would present a security risk.\nNew Court.\nNew Court (or \"King's Court\"; built 1825, William Wilkins) is located to the south of Nevile's Court, and built in Tudor-Gothic style; this court is notable for the large tree in the centre. A myth is sometimes circulated that this was the tree from which the apple dropped onto Isaac Newton; in fact, Newton was at home in Woolsthorpe when he deduced his theory of gravity \u2013 and the tree is a horse chestnut tree. For many years it was the custom for students to place a bicycle high in branches of the tree of New Court. Usually invisible except in winter, when the leaves had fallen, such bicycles tended to remain for several years before being removed by the authorities. The students then inserted another bicycle.\nOther courts.\nWhewell's Court (1860\u20131868, Anthony Salvin) is located across the street from Great Court, and was entirely paid for by William Whewell, the Master of the college from 1841 until his death in 1866. The north range was later remodelled by W.D. Caroe. Angel Court (built 1957\u20131959, H. C. Husband) is located between Great Court and Trinity Street, and is used along with the Wolfson Building for accommodating first year students.\nThe Wolfson Building (built 1968\u20131972, Architects' Co-Partnership) is located to the south of Whewell's Court, on top of a podium above shops, this building resembles a brick-clad ziggurat, and is used exclusively for first-year accommodation. Having been renovated during the academic year 2005\u201306, many rooms are now en-suite. Blue Boar Court (built 1989, MJP Architects) is located to the south of the Wolfson Building, on top of podium a floor up from ground level, and including the upper floors of several surrounding Georgian buildings on Trinity Street, Green Street and Sidney Street. Burrell's Field (built 1995, MJP Architects) is located on a site to the west of the main College buildings, opposite the Cambridge University Library.\nChapel.\nTrinity College Chapel dates from the mid 16th century and is Grade I listed. There are a number of memorials to former Fellows of Trinity within the Chapel, including statues, brasses, and two memorials to graduates and Fellows who died during the World Wars. Among the most notable of these is a statue of Isaac Newton by Roubiliac, described by Sir Francis Chantrey as \"the noblest, I think, of all our English statues.\" The Chapel is a performance space for the College Choir which comprises around thirty Choral Scholars and two Organ Scholars, all of whom are ordinarily students at the University.\nGrounds.\nThe Fellows' Garden is located on the west side of Queen's Road, opposite the drive that leads to the Backs. The Fellows' Bowling Green is located north of Great Court, between King's Hostel and the river. It is the site for many of the tutors' garden parties in the summer months, while the Master's Garden is located behind the Master's Lodge. The Old Fields are located on the western side of Grange Road, next to Burrell's Field. It currently houses the college's gym, changing rooms, squash courts, badminton courts, rugby, hockey and football pitches along with tennis and netball courts.\nTrinity Bridge.\nTrinity Bridge is a stone built triple-arched road bridge across the River Cam. It was built of Portland stone in 1765 to the designs of James Essex to replace an earlier bridge built in 1651 and is a Grade I listed building.\nAcademic profile.\nSince 1997, the college has always come at least eighth in the Tompkins Table, which ranks the twenty-nine undergraduate Cambridge colleges according to the academic performance of their undergraduates, and on eleven occasions it has been in first place. Its average position in the Tompkins Table over that period has been between second and third, higher than any other. In 2016, 45% of Trinity undergraduates achieved First Class Honours, twelve percentage points ahead of second place Pembroke \u2013 a record among Cambridge colleges.\nAdmissions.\nTrinity's history, academic performance and alumni have made it one of the most prestigious constituent colleges of the University, making admission extremely competitive. About 50% of Trinity's undergraduates attended independent schools. In 2006 it accepted a smaller proportion of students from state schools (39%) than any other Cambridge college, and on a rolling three-year average it has admitted a smaller proportion of state school pupils (42%) than any other college at either Cambridge or Oxford. According to the \"Good Schools Guide\", about 7% of British school-age students attend private schools, although this figure refers to students in all school years \u2013 a higher proportion attend private schools in their final two years before university. Trinity states that it disregards what type of school its applicants attend, and accepts students solely on the basis of their academic prospects. Trinity admitted its first female graduate student in 1976, its first female undergraduate in 1978 and elected its first female fellow (Marian Hobson) in 1977.\nScholarships and prizes.\nThe Scholars, together with the Master and Fellows, make up the Foundation of the College. In order of seniority:\nThese scholarships are tenable for the academic year following that in which the result was achieved. If a scholarship is awarded but the student does not continue at Trinity then only a quarter of the stipend is given. However, all students who achieve a First are awarded an additional \u00a3240 prize upon announcement of the results.\nMany final year undergraduates who achieve first-class honours in their final exams are offered full financial support, through a scheme known as Internal Graduate Studentships, to read for a master's degree at Cambridge. Other support is available for PhD degrees. The College also offers a number of other bursaries and studentships open to external applicants. The right to walk on the grass in the college courts is exclusive to Fellows of the college and their guests. Scholars do, however, have the right to walk on the Scholars' Lawn, but only in full academic dress.\nTraditions.\nGreat Court Run.\nThe Great Court Run requires a circuit of the 400-yard perimeter of Great Court, in the 43 seconds of the clock striking 12. The time varies according to humidity. Students traditionally attempt to complete the circuit on the day of the Matriculation Dinner. It is a difficult challenge: one needs to be a fine sprinter to achieve it, but it is not necessary to be of Olympic standard, despite assertions made in the press.\nIt is widely believed that Sebastian Coe successfully completed the run when he beat Steve Cram in a charity race in October 1988. Coe's time on 29 October 1988 was reported by Norris McWhirter to have been 45.52 seconds, but it was actually 46.0 seconds, while Cram's was 46.3 seconds. The clock on that day took 44.4 seconds and the video film confirms that Coe was some 12 metres short of the finish line when the final stroke occurred. The television commentators were wrong to speculate that the dying sounds of the bell could be included in the striking time, thereby allowing Coe's run to be claimed as successful. One reason Olympic runners Cram and Coe found the challenge difficult is that they started at the middle of one side of the court, having to negotiate four right-angle turns. In the days when students started at a corner, only three turns were needed. In addition, Cram and Coe ran entirely on the flagstones, while until 2017 students have typically cut corners to run on the cobbles.\nThe Great Court Run was portrayed in the film \"Chariots of Fire\" about the British Olympic runners of 1924. The run was filmed at Eton College in Berkshire, not in Great Court. Until the mid-1990s, the run was traditionally attempted by first-year students at midnight following their matriculation dinner. Following a number of accidents to undergraduates running on slippery cobbles, the college now organises a more formal Great Court Run, at 12 noon on the day of the matriculation dinner: while some contestants compete seriously, many others run in fancy dress and there are prizes for the fastest man and woman in each category.\nOpen-air concerts.\n\"Singing on the River\", 5 June 2016\nOne Sunday each June, the College Choir perform a short concert immediately after the clock strikes noon. Known as \"Singing from the Towers\", half of the choir sings from the top of the Great Gate, while the other half sings from the top of the Clock Tower approximately 60 metres away, giving a strong antiphonal effect. Midway through the concert, the Cambridge University Brass Ensemble performs from the top of the Queen's Tower.\nLater that same day, the College Choir gives a second open-air concert, known as \"Singing on the River\", where they perform madrigals and arrangements of popular songs from a raft of punts lit with lanterns or fairy lights on the river. For the finale, John Wilbye's madrigal \"Draw on, sweet night\", the raft is unmoored and punted downstream to give a fade out effect. As a tradition, however, this latter concert dates back only to the mid-1980s, when the College Choir first acquired female members. In the years immediately before this, an annual concert on the river was given by the University Madrigal Society.\nMallard.\nAnother tradition relates to an artificial duck known as the Mallard, which should reside in the rafters of the Great Hall. Students occasionally moved the duck from one rafter to another without permission from the college. This is considered difficult; access to the Hall outside meal-times is prohibited and the rafters are dangerously high, so it was not attempted for several years. During the Easter term of 2006, the Mallard was knocked off its rafter by one of the pigeons which enter the Hall through the pinnacle windows. It was reinstated by students in 2016, and is only visible from the far end of the hall.\nCollege rivalry.\nThe college remains a great rival of St John's which is its main competitor in sports and academia. This has given rise to a number of anecdotes and myths. It is often cited as the reason that the older courts of Trinity generally have no J staircases, despite including other letters in alphabetical order. A far more likely reason is that the Latin alphabet did not have the letter J\u2014the older courts of St John's College also lack J staircases. There are also two small muzzle-loading cannons on the bowling green pointing in the direction of John's, though this orientation may be coincidental. Another story sometimes told is that the reason that the clock in Trinity Great Court strikes each hour twice is that the fellows of St John's once complained about the noise it made.\nCollege Grace.\nEach evening before dinner, grace is recited by the senior fellow presiding, as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\nIf both of the two high tables are in use then the following antiphonal formula is prefixed to the main grace:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\nFollowing the meal, the simple formula is pronounced.\nPunt names.\nBefitting the term \"trinity\", Trinity College punts are named after people or things related to the number three, such as \"Bronze\" (award for third place), \"Codon\" (which has three nucleotides) and \"Wise Monkey\". In 2023, the launch of the punt \"Charles\" marked the coronation of alumnus Charles III.\nMinor traditions.\nTrinity College undergraduate gowns are readily distinguished from the black gowns favoured by most other Cambridge colleges. They are instead dark blue with black facings. They are expected to be worn to formal events such as formal halls and also when an undergraduate sees the Dean of the College in a formal capacity. Trinity students, along with those of King's and St John's, are the first to be presented to the Congregation of the Regent House at graduation.\nPeople associated with Trinity.\nNotable fellows and alumni.\nThe Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge contains the graves of 27 Fellows of Trinity College, Cambridge most of whom are also commemorated in Trinity College Chapel with brass plaques. Charles III, King of the United Kingdom, attended from 1967 to 1970. Marian Hobson was the first woman to become a Fellow of the college, having been elected in 1977, and her portrait now hangs in the college hall along with those of other notable members of the college. Other notable female Fellows include Anne Barton, Marilyn Strathern, Catherine Barnard, Lynn Gladden and Rebecca Fitzgerald.\nNobel Prize winners.\nThis list includes winners of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, which is not one of the five Nobel Prizes established by Alfred Nobel's will in 1895.\nFields Medallists.\nFour members or alumni of Trinity College have been awarded the Fields Medal.\nBritish prime ministers.\nOther Trinity politicians include Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, courtier of Elizabeth I; William Waddington, Prime Minister of France; Erskine Hamilton Childers, fourth president of Ireland; Jawaharlal Nehru, the first and longest-serving prime minister of India; Rajiv Gandhi, Prime Minister of India; Lee Hsien Loong, Prime Minister of Singapore; Samir Rifai, Prime Minister of Jordan; Richard Blumenthal, incumbent senior US senator from Connecticut; and William Whitelaw, home secretary and subsequently deputy prime minister.\nMasters.\nThe head of Trinity College is called the Master. The role is a Crown appointment, formally made by the monarch on the advice of the prime minister. Nowadays, the fellows of the college propose a new master for the appointment, but the decision is formally that of the Crown. The first Master, John Redman, was appointed in 1546. Six masters subsequent to Rab Butler had been fellows of the college prior to becoming master (honorary fellow in the case of Martin Rees), the last of these being Sir Gregory Winter, appointed on 2 October 2012. He was succeeded by Dame Sally Davies, the first female Master of Trinity College, on 8 October 2019.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Cambridge's colleges are communities of students, academics and staff \u2013 an environment in which generations and academic disciplines are able to mix, with both students and fellows experiencing \"the breadth and excellence of a top University at an intimate level\".\nCambridge colleges provide most of the accommodation for \"undergraduates\" and \"postgraduates\" at the university. At the undergraduate level they have responsibility for admitting students to the university, providing pastoral support, and organising elements of their tuition, though lectures and examinations are organised by the faculties and departments of the central university. All degrees are awarded by the university itself, not the colleges, and all students study for the same course regardless of which college they attend. For postgraduate students, research is conducted centrally in the faculties, departments and other university-affiliated research centres, though the colleges provide a central social and intellectual hub for students.\nColleges provide a range of facilities and services to their members in addition to accommodation, including: catering, library facilities, extracurricular societies, and sporting teams. Much of sporting life at Cambridge is centred around college teams and inter-collegiate competition in Cuppers. Student activity is typically organised through separate common rooms for undergraduate and postgraduate students. Another important element of collegiate life is formal hall, which range in frequency from weekly to every night of the week during Full Term.\nColleges also provide funding, accommodation, or both, for some of the academic posts in the university, with the majority of Cambridge academics being a fellow of a college in addition to their faculty/departmental role. Fellows may therefore hold college positions in addition to their academic posts at the university: these include roles such as Tutor (responsible for pastoral support), Director of Studies (responsible for academic oversight of students taking a particular subject), Dean (responsible for discipline among college members), Senior Tutor (responsible for the college's overall academic provision), or Head of college ('Head of House').\nColleges are self-governed charities in their own right, with their own endowments and possessions.\n\"Old\" and \"new\" colleges.\nThe University of Cambridge has 31 colleges, founded between the 13th and 20th centuries. No colleges were founded between 1596 (Sidney Sussex College) and 1800 (Downing College), which allows the colleges to be distinguished into two groups according to foundation date:\nThe oldest college is Peterhouse, founded in 1284, and the newest is Robinson, founded in 1977. Homerton, which was first founded in the eighteenth century as a dissenting academy (and later teacher training college), attained full college status in 2010.\nSix of the \"new\" colleges (Churchill, Fitzwilliam, Girton, Lucy Cavendish, Murray Edwards and St Edmund's) are located on Castle Hill and are thus sometimes referred to as \"hill colleges\".\nRestrictions on entry.\nAll 16 of the \"old\" colleges and 8 of the 15 \"new\" ones admit both male and female students as both undergraduates and postgraduates, without any age restrictions. Seven colleges restrict entry by sex, or by age of undergraduates, or admit only postgraduates:\nNo colleges are all-male, although most originally were. Darwin, founded in 1964, was the first mixed college, while in 1972 Churchill, Clare and King's colleges were the first previously all-male colleges to admit women, whilst King's accepted only students from Eton College until 1865. The last all-male college to become mixed was Magdalene, in 1988. In 1973 Hughes Hall became the first all-female college to admit men, and Girton first admitted men in 1979. Lucy Cavendish admitted only female mature students and postgraduates until 2021.\nNewnham also places restrictions on the admission of staff members, allowing only women to become fellows of the college. Murray Edwards does not place this restriction on fellows.\nArchitectural influence.\nThe Cambridge and Oxford colleges have served as an architectural inspiration for Collegiate Gothic architecture, used by a number of American universities including Princeton University, Cornell University, University of Chicago, and Washington University in St. Louis since the late nineteenth century.\nList of colleges.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Sort under/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThere are also several theological colleges in the city of Cambridge (for example Ridley Hall, Wesley House, Westcott House and Westminster College) that are affiliated with the university through the Cambridge Theological Federation. These colleges, while not officially part of the University of Cambridge, operate programmes that are either validated by or are taught on behalf either of the university or of Anglia Ruskin or Durham Universities.\nHeads of colleges.\nMost colleges are led by a Master, even when the Master is female. However, there are some exceptions, listed below. Girton College has always had a Mistress, even though male candidates have been able to run for the office since 1976.\nAlso see List of current heads of University of Cambridge colleges.\nFormer colleges.\nThe above list does not include several former colleges that no longer exist.

The college includes the Master, the Fellows of the College, and about 450 undergraduate and 250 graduate students. The college was founded by William Byngham in 1437 as God's House. In 1505, the college was granted a new royal charter, was given a substantial endowment by Lady Margaret Beaufort, and changed its name to Christ's College, becoming the twelfth of the Cambridge colleges to be founded in its modern form. \nAlumni of the college include the poet John Milton, the naturalist Charles Darwin, as well as the Nobel Laureates Martin Evans, James Meade, Alexander Todd, Duncan Haldane, and John Clarke. The Master is Lord McDonald of Salford.\nHistory.\nChrist's College was founded by William Byngham in 1437 as God's House, on land which was soon after sold to enable the enlargement of King's College. Byngham obtained the first royal licence for God's House in July 1439. The college was founded to provide for the lack of grammar-school masters in England at the time, and the college has been described as \"the first secondary-school training college on record\". The original site of God\u2019s House was surrendered in 1443 to King's College. About three-quarters of King's College Chapel stands on the original site of God's House.\nAfter the original royal licence of 1439, three more licences, two in 1442 and one in 1446, were granted before in 1448 God's House received the charter upon which the college was in fact founded. In this charter, King Henry VI was named as the founder, and in the same year the college moved to its modern site.\nIn 1505, the college was endowed by Lady Margaret Beaufort, mother of King Henry VII, and was given the name Christ's College, perhaps at the suggestion of her confessor, the Bishop John Fisher. The expansion in the population of the college in the 17th century led to the building, in the 1640s, of the Fellows' Building in what is now Second Court.\nBuildings.\nThe original 15th/16th-century college buildings now form part of First Court, including the chapel, Master's Lodge and Great Gate tower. The gate itself is disproportionate: the bottom has been cut off to accommodate a rise in street level, which can be seen in the steps leading \"down\" to the foot of L staircase in the gate tower. The college hall was built at the start of the 16th century, and restored in 1875\u20131879 by George Gilbert Scott the younger. The lawn of First Court is famously round, and a wisteria sprawls up the front of the Master's lodge.\nSecond Court is fully built up on only three sides, one of which is formed by the 1640s Fellows' Building. The fourth side backs onto the Master's garden.\nThe Stevenson Building in Third Court was designed by J. J. Stevenson in the 1880s and was extended in 1905 as part of the College's Quadcentenary. In 1947 Professor Albert Richardson designed a new cupola for the Stevenson building, and a second building, the neo-Georgian Chancellor's Building (W staircase, now known as the Blyth Building), completed in 1950. Third Court's Memorial Building (Y staircase), a twin of the Chancellor's building, also by Richardson, was completed in 1953 at a cost of \u00a380,000. Third Court is also noted for its display of irises in May and June, a gift to the college in 1946.\nThe controversial tiered concrete New Court (often dubbed \"the Typewriter\") was designed in the Modernist style by Sir Denys Lasdun in 1966\u201370, and was described as \"superb\" in Lasdun's obituary in the \"Guardian\". Design critic Hugh Pearman comments \"Lasdun had big trouble relating to the street at the overhanging rear\". It appears distinctively in aerial photographs, forming part of the northern boundary of the college.\nAn assortment of neighbouring buildings have been absorbed into the college, of which the most notable is the Todd Building, previously Cambridge's County Hall.\nThrough an arch in the Fellows' Building is the Fellows' Garden. It includes two mulberry trees, of which the older was planted in 1608, the same year as Milton's birth. Both trees have toppled sideways, the younger tree in the Great Storm of 1987, and are now earthed up round the trunks, but continue to fruit every year.\nSwimming pool.\nChrist's College is one of only five colleges in Oxford or Cambridge to have its own swimming pool. It is fed by water from Hobson's Conduit. Recently refurbished, it is now known as the 'Malcolm Bowie Bathing Pool', and is thought to be the oldest outdoor swimming pool in the UK, dating from the mid 17th century. The other four swimming pools within colleges belong to Girton College (indoor pool), Corpus Christi College (outdoor pool), Emmanuel College (outdoor pool) and Clare Hall (indoor pool).\nAcademic profile.\nWith a reputation even within Cambridge for the highest academic standards, Christ's came first in the Tompkins Table's twentieth anniversary aggregate table, and between 2001 and 2007, it had a mean position of third. Academic excellence continues at Christ's, with 91% of students in 2013 gaining a first class degree or an upper second (II.i). This is significantly higher than the University average of 70%.\nChrist's is noted for educating two of Cambridge's most famous alumni, the poet John Milton and the naturalist Charles Darwin, who, during the celebrations for the 800th anniversary of the University, were both placed at the foreground as two of the four most iconic individuals in the University's history. The college has also educated Nobel Laureates including Martin Evans, James Meade, Alexander Todd and Duncan Haldane. It is the University's 6th largest producer of Nobel Prize winners.\nSome of the college's other famous alumni include former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams; theologian William Paley; historian Simon Schama; South African Prime Minister Jan Smuts; Lord Mountbatten; medical doctor, scientist and diplomat Davidson Nicol; businessperson Ronald Bauer; and comedians John Oliver, Sacha Baron Cohen and Andy Parsons.\nStudent life.\nThe Junior Combination Room (JCR) represents the undergraduate students. It organises social and welfare events, and negotiates on the students' behalf on important issues. The JCR has a standing committee and a common room for all the students. The JCR's counterpart, the Middle Combination Room (MCR), represents the graduate students of the College, and has its own bar. The MCR organises regular Graduate Halls. A Garden Party is held by both the JCR and the MCR every June in the Fellows' Garden. The Senior Combination Room (SCR) is composed solely of fellows of the College and holds two feasts each year.\nThe Chaplain of the college is Dr Helen Orchard.\nOther societies at Christ's include:\nMay ball.\nChrist's, like most other Cambridge Colleges, also hosts a biennial May Ball in the time after undergraduate examinations which is by students commonly known as May Week. A separate society called \"Christ's College May Ball Committee\" is set up every two years to organise and direct this event. The 2010 May Ball, named \"L'Esprit Nouveau\", was held on 15 June 2010 and featured a 1920s Parisian theme, Two Door Cinema Club headlined the entertainment. The May Ball in June 2012 featured a Rio de Janeiro carnival theme. Other previous themes include Le Reve in 2002, Silhouette in 2004, Elysium in 2006 and 'The Jasmine Ball' in 2008. The May Ball on Tuesday 17 June 2014 was hailed as one of the best May Balls of the year. It was themed \"The Emerald City\". The May Ball in 2016 was themed as Biophilia. In 2018 the theme was A Night's Tale. While the 2020 Ball was cancelled due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, the May Ball returned in 2022, themed as Mythos. The 2024 May Ball was themed after the William Shakespeare play, \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\".\nGrace.\nThe College Grace is normally said before any dinner held in the Formal Hall of the College. Though the student body rises for the recitation of the Grace, Christ's is one of the only Colleges in Cambridge where the students do not rise when the Fellows enter and leave the Dining Hall. This is said to be the result of a historical conflict between the Students and Fellows at Christ's, who were on opposite sides during the English Civil War. The words of the Grace are:"}
{"id": "31806", "revid": "2699102", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31806", "title": "Peterhouse, Cambridge", "text": "College of the University of Cambridge\nPeterhouse is a constituent college of the University of Cambridge in England, founded in 1284 by Hugh de Balsham, Bishop of Ely. Peterhouse has around 300 undergraduate and 175 graduate students, and 54 fellows.\nPeterhouse alumni are notably eminent within the natural sciences, including scientists Lord Kelvin, Henry Cavendish, Charles Babbage, James Clerk Maxwell, James Dewar, Frank Whittle, and five Nobel prize winners in science: Sir John Kendrew, Sir Aaron Klug, Archer Martin, Max Perutz, and Michael Levitt. Peterhouse alumni also include Lord Chancellors, Lord Chief Justices, important poets such as Thomas Gray, the first Anglican Bishop of New York Samuel Provoost, the first British Fields Medallist Klaus Roth, Oscar-winning film director Sam Mendes and comedian David Mitchell. British Prime Minister Augustus FitzRoy, 3rd Duke of Grafton, and Elijah Mudenda, second prime minister of Zambia, also studied at the college.\nPeterhouse is one of the wealthiest colleges in Cambridge, with assets exceeding \u00a3350 million. It is currently third in terms of net assets per student. Members of Peterhouse are encouraged to attend communal dinners, known as \"Hall\". Hall takes place in two sittings, with the second known as \"Formal Hall\", which consists of a three-course candlelit meal and which must be attended wearing suits and gowns. At Formal Hall, the students rise as the fellows proceed in, a gong is rung, and two Latin graces are read. Peterhouse also hosts a biennial white-tie ball as part of May Week celebrations.\nIn recent years, Peterhouse has been ranked as one of the highest achieving colleges in Cambridge, although academic performance tends to vary year to year due to its small population. In the past five years, it has sat in the top ten of the 29 colleges within the Tompkins Table. Peterhouse sat at fourth in 2018 and 2019.\nHistory.\nFoundation.\nThe foundation of Peterhouse dates to 1280, when letters patent from Edward I dated Burgh, Suffolk, 24 December 1280 allowed Hugh de Balsham, to keep a number of scholars in the Hospital of St John, where they were to live according to the rules of the scholars of Merton. After disagreement between the scholars and the Brethren of the Hospital, both requested a separation. As a result, in 1284 Balsham transferred the scholars to the present site with the purchase of two houses just outside the then Trumpington Gate to accommodate a Master and fourteen \"worthy but impoverished Fellows\". The Church of St Peter without Trumpington Gate was to be used by the scholars. Bishop Hugo de Balsham died in 1286, bequeathing 300 marks that were used to buy further land to the south of St Peter's Church, on which the college's Hall was built.\nThe earliest surviving set of statutes for the college was given to it by the then Bishop of Ely, Simon Montacute, in 1344. Although based on those of Merton College, these statutes clearly display the lack of resources then available to the college. They were used in 1345 to defeat an attempt by Edward III to appoint a candidate of his own as scholar. In 1354\u201355, William Moschett set up a trust that resulted in nearly of land at Fen Ditton being transferred to the College by 1391\u201392. The College's relative poverty was relieved in 1401 when it acquired the advowson and rectory of Hinton through the efforts of Bishop John Fordham and John Newton. During the reign of Elizabeth I, the college also acquired the area formerly known as Volney's Croft, which today is the area of St Peter's Terrace, the William Stone Building and the Scholars' Garden.\n16th century onwards.\nIn 1553, Andrew Perne was appointed Master. His religious views were pragmatic enough to be favoured by both Mary I, who gave him the Deanery of Ely, and Elizabeth I. A contemporary joke was that the letters on the weathervane of St Peter's Church could represent \"Andrew Perne, Papist\" or \"Andrew Perne, Protestant\" according to which way the wind was blowing. Having previously been close to the reformist Regius Chair of Divinity, Martin Bucer, later as vice-chancellor of the university Perne would have Bucer's bones exhumed and burnt in Market Square. John Foxe in his \"Actes and Monuments\" singled this out as \"shameful railing\". There is a hole burnt in the middle of the relevant page in Perne's own copy of Foxe. Perne died in 1589, leaving a legacy to the college that funded a number of fellowships and scholarships, as well bequeathing an extensive collection of books. This collection and rare volumes since added to it is now known as the Perne Library.\nBetween 1626 and 1634, the Master was Matthew Wren. Wren had previously accompanied Charles I on his journey to Spain to attempt to negotiate the Spanish Match. Wren was a firm supporter of Archbishop William Laud, and under Wren the college became known as a centre of Arminianism. This continued under the Mastership of John Cosin, who succeeded Wren in 1634. Under Cosin significant changes were made to the college's Chapel to bring it into line with Laud's idea of the \"beauty of holiness\". On 13 March 1643, in the early stages of the English Civil War, Cosin was expelled from his position by a Parliamentary ordinance from the Earl of Manchester. The Earl stated that he was deposed \"for his opposing the proceedings of Parliament, and other scandalous acts in the University\". On 21 December of the same year, statues and decorations in the Chapel were pulled down by a committee led by the Puritan zealot William Dowsing.\nThe college was the first in the University to have electric lighting installed, when Lord Kelvin provided it for the Hall and Combination Room to celebrate the College's six-hundredth anniversary in 1883\u20131884. It was the second building in the country to get electric lighting, after the Palace of Westminster.\nThe college developed a strong reputation for the teaching of history from the time of Harold Temperley, and during World War II its fellowship simultaneously included four professors in the university's faculty for that subject \u2013 Herbert Butterfield, David Knowles, Michael Postan and Denis Brogan.\nModern day.\nIn the 1980s Peterhouse acquired an association with Conservative politics. Maurice Cowling and Roger Scruton were both influential fellows of the College and are sometimes described as key figures in the so-called \"Peterhouse right\" \u2013 an intellectual movement linked to philosophical conservativism. While often associated with Thatcherite politics (notably, the Conservative politicians Michael Portillo and Michael Howard both studied at Peterhouse), the extent to which Margaret Thatcher's economic liberalism was admired within the movement was limited. During this period, which coincided with the mastership of Hugh Trevor-Roper, the college endured a period of significant conflict among the fellowship, particularly between Trevor-Roper and Cowling.\nTrevor-Roper feuded constantly with Cowling and his allies, while launching a series of administrative reforms. Women were admitted in 1983 at his urging. The British journalist Neal Ascherson summarised the quarrel between Cowling and Trevor-Roper thus:Lord Dacre, far from being a romantic Tory ultra, turned out to be an anti-clerical Whig with a preference for free speech over superstition. He did not find it normal that fellows should wear mourning on the anniversary of General Franco's death, attend parties in SS uniform or insult black and Jewish guests at high table. For the next seven years, Trevor-Roper battled to suppress the insurgency of the Cowling clique (\"a strong mind trapped in its own glutinous frustrations\"), and to bring the college back to a condition in which students might actually want to go there. Neither side won this struggle, which soon became a campaign to drive Trevor-Roper out of the college by grotesque rudeness and insubordination. In a review of Adam Sisman's 2010 biography of Trevor-Roper, the \"Economist\" wrote that his picture of Peterhouse in the 1980s was \"startling\", stating the college had become under Cowling's influence a sort of right-wing \"lunatic asylum\", who were determined to sabotage Trevor-Roper's reforms. In 1987 Trevor-Roper retired complaining of \"seven wasted years.\"\nPeterhouse may have been one of the sources of inspiration for Tom Sharpe's \"Porterhouse Blue\".\nBuildings and grounds.\nPeterhouse has its main site situated on Trumpington Street, to the south of Cambridge's town centre. The main portion of the college is just to the north of the Fitzwilliam Museum, and its grounds run behind the museum. The buildings date from a wide variety of times, and have been much altered over the years. The college is reputed to have been at least partially destroyed by fire in 1420. The entrance of the college has shifted through its lifetime as well, with the change being principally the result of the demolition of the row of houses that originally lined Trumpington Street on the east side of the college. In 1574, a map shows the entrance being on the south side of a single main court. The modern entrance is to the east, straight onto Trumpington Street.\nFirst Court.\nThe area closest to Trumpington Street is referred to as First Court. It is bounded to the north by the Burrough's Building (added in the 18th century), to the east by the street, to the south by the Porters' lodge and to the west by the chapel. Above the Porters' lodge is the Perne Library, named in honour of Andrew Perne, a former Master, and originally built in 1590 to house the collection that he donated to the college. It was extended towards the road in 1633 and features interior woodwork that was added in 1641\u201348 by William Ashley, who was also responsible for similar woodwork in the chapel. Electric lighting was added to the library in 1937. The area above the Perne Library was used as the Ward Library (the college's general purpose library) from 1952 to 1984, but that has now been moved to its own building in the north-west corner of the college site.\nBurrough's Building.\nThe Burrough's Building is situated at the front of the college, parallel to the Chapel. It is named after its architect, Sir James Burrough, the Master of Caius, and was built in 1736. It is one of several Cambridge neo-Palladian buildings designed by Burrough. Others include the remodelling of the Hall and Old Court at Trinity Hall and the chapel at Clare College. The building is occupied by fellows and college offices.\nOld Court.\nOld Court lies beyond the Chapel cloisters. To the south of the court is the dining hall, the only College building that survives from the 13th century and the oldest collegiate building in all of Cambridge. Between 1866 and 1870, the hall was restored by the architect George Gilbert Scott, Jr. Under Scott, the timber roof was repaired and two old parlours merged to form a new Combination Room. The stained glass windows were also replaced with Pre-Raphaelite pieces by William Morris, Ford Madox Brown and Edward Burne-Jones. The fireplace (originally built in 1618) was restored with tiles by Morris, including depictions of St Peter and Hugo de Balsham. The hall was extensively renovated in 2006-7.\nThe north and west sides of Old Court were added in the 15th century, and classicised in the 18th century. The chapel makes up the fourth, east side to the court. Rooms in Old Court are occupied by a mixture of fellows and undergraduates. The north side of the court also house Peterhouse's MCR (Middle Combination Room).\nChapel.\nViewed from the main entrance to Peterhouse on Trumpington Street, the altar end of the Chapel is the most immediately visible building. The Chapel was built in 1628 when the Master of the time Matthew Wren (Christopher Wren's uncle) demolished the college's original hostels. Previously the college had employed the adjacent Church of St Mary the Less as its chapel. The Chapel was consecrated on 17 March 1632 by Francis White, Bishop of Ely. The building's style reflects the contemporary religious trend towards Arminianism. The Laudian Gothic style of the Chapel mixes Renaissance details but incorporated them into a traditional Gothic building. The Chapel's Renaissance architecture contains a Piet\u00e0 altarpiece and a striking ceiling of golden suns. Its placement in the centre of one side of a court, between open colonnades is unusual, being copied for a single other college (Emmanuel) by Christopher Wren. The original stained glass was destroyed by Parliamentarians in 1643, with only the east window's crucifixion scene (based on Rubens's \"Le Coup de Lance\") surviving. The current side windows are by Max Ainmiller, and were added in 1855. The cloisters on each side of the Chapel date from the 17th century. Their design was classicised in 1709, while an ornamental porch was removed in 1755. \nThe Peterhouse Partbooks, music manuscripts from the early years of the Chapel, survive, and are one of the most important collections of Tudor and Jacobean church music. The Choir of Peterhouse has recently attracted wider interest for its regular performances of this material, some of which has not been heard since the 16th century, and have released a CD of music from the Caroline partbooks. The Organ in the Chapel was installed in 1765 John Snetzler. During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the Organ was expanded and renovated by Hill &amp; Son (1893-94) and Noel Mander (1963). In 2023, the Organ underwent a substantial restoration and renovation project by Flentrop and Klais. This restoration uniquely provides two mechanical-action consoles: one 'historic' console intended to recreate the experience of playing Snetzler's original instrument; the other a contemporary console, to allow for the performance of a wider range of repertoire. \nThe first person buried in the Chapel was Samuel Horne, a fellow of the college. Horne was probably chaplain.\nGisborne Court.\nGisborne Court is accessible through an archway leading from the west side of Old Court. It was built in 1825-6. Its cost was met with part of a benefaction of 1817 from the Rev. Francis Gisborne, a former fellow. The court is built in white brick with stone dressings in a simple Gothic revival style from the designs of William McIntosh Brookes. Only three sides to the court were built, with the fourth side being a screen wall. The wall was demolished in 1939, leaving only its footing. Rooms in Gisborne Court are mainly occupied by undergraduates. Many previously housed distinguished alumni, including Lord Kelvin in I staircase.\nThe Whittle Building, named after Petrean Frank Whittle, opened on the western side of Gisborne Court in early 2015. Designed in neo-gothic style by John Simpson Architects, it contains en-suite undergraduate accommodation, the student bar and common room, a function room and a gym. Its design recalls that of the original screen-wall that once stood in its place. In 2015 the building was shortlisted for the Carbuncle Cup, given annually by the magazine \"Building Design\" to \"the ugliest building in the United Kingdom completed in the last 12 months\".\nFen Court.\nBeyond Gisborne Court is Fen Court, a 20th-century building partially on stilts. Fen Court was built between 1939 and 1941 from designs by H. C. Hughes and his partner Peter Bicknell. It was amongst the earliest buildings in Cambridge designed in the style of the Modern Movement pioneered by Walter Gropius at the Bauhaus. The carved panel by Anthony Foster over the entrance doorway evokes the mood in Britain as the building was completed. It bears the inscription DE PROFUNDIS CLAMAVI MCMXL \u2014 \"out of the depths have I cried out 1940\". These are the first words of Psalm 130, one of the Penitential Psalms. Alongside the inscription is a depiction of St Peter being saved from the sea.\nAn adjacent bath-house, known as the Birdwood Building, used to make up the western side of Gisborne Court. This was also designed by Hughes and Bicknell, and was built between 1932 and 1934. It was demolished in 2013 to make way for the new Whittle Building.\nWard Library.\nThe north-west corner of the main site is occupied by former Victorian warehouses containing the Ward Library, as well as a theatre and function room. The building it is housed in was originally the University's Museum of Classical Archaeology and was designed by Basil Champneys in 1883. It was adapted to its modern purpose by Robert Potter in 1982 and opened in its current form as a library two years later. In recent years, the final gallery of the old museum building has been converted into a reading room, named the Gunn Gallery, after Chan Gunn.\nGardens.\nWhile officially being named the Grove, the grounds to the south of Gisborne Court have been known as the Deer Park since deer were brought there in the 19th century. During that period it achieved fame as the smallest deer park in England. After the First World War the deer sickened and passed their illness onto stock that had been imported from the Duke of Portland's estate at Welbeck Abbey in an attempt to improve the situation. There are no longer any deer.\nThe remainder of the college's gardens divide into areas known as the Fellows' Garden, just to the south of Old Court, and the Scholars' Garden, at the south end of the site, surrounding the William Stone Building.\nWilliam Stone Building.\nThe William Stone Building stands in the Scholars' Garden and was funded by a \u00a3100,000 bequest from William Stone (1857\u20131958), a former scholar of the college. Erected in 1963-4, to a design by Sir Leslie Martin and Sir Colin St John Wilson, it is an eight-storey brick tower housing eight fellows and 24 undergraduates. It has been refurbished, converting the rooms to en-suite.\nTrumpington Street.\nThe college also occupies a number of buildings on Trumpington Street.\nThe Master's Lodge is situated across Trumpington Street from the College, and was bequeathed to the College in 1727 by a fellow, Charles Beaumont, son of the 30th Master of the college, Joseph Beaumont. It is built in red brick in the Queen Anne style.\nThe Hostel is situated next to the Master's Lodge. It was built in a neo-Georgian style in 1926 from designs by Thomas Henry Lyon. The Hostel was intended to be part of a larger complex but only one wing was built. It currently houses undergraduates and some fellows. During World War II the London School of Economics was housed in The Hostel and nearby buildings, at the invitation of the Master and Fellows.\nBehind the Hostel lies Cosin Court, which provides accommodation for fellows and mature, postgraduate, and married students. The court is named for John Cosin (1594\u20131672) who was successively Master of Peterhouse, Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge University and Prince-Bishop of Durham.\nSt Peter's Terrace is a row of Georgian townhouses houses first-year undergraduates, fellows, and some graduate students in basement flats. It is directly in front of the William Stone Building.\nArms.\nThe College has, during its history, used five different coats of arms. The one currently in use has two legitimate blazons. The first form is the original grant by Robert Cooke, Clarenceux King of Arms, in 1575:\n \"Or four pallets Gules within a border of the last charged with eight ducal coronets of the first.\"\nThe College did, however, habitually use a version with three pallets, and this was allowed at the Herald's Visitation of Cambridgeshire in 1684. The latter version (with three pallets) was officially adopted by the Governing Body in 1935. The construction of the arms is that of the founder, Hugo de Balsham, surrounded by the crowns of the See of Ely.\nGrace.\nPeterhouse and Jesus College are the only two colleges to have two separate halves to their grace, the first being a standard grace, and the second a quotation of 1 John 4:16.\nPeople associated with Peterhouse.\nMembers of Peterhouse \u2014 as masters, fellows (including honorary fellows) or students \u2014 are known as \"Petreans.\"\nNobel laureates.\nPeterhouse has five Nobel laureates associated with it, either as former students or fellows.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its name in English is \"u\" (pronounced ), plural \"ues\".\nName.\nIn English, the name of the letter is the \"long U\" sound, pronounced . In most other languages, its name matches the letter's pronunciation in open syllables.\nHistory.\nU derives from the Semitic waw, as does F, and later, Y, W, and V. Its oldest ancestor goes back to Egyptian hieroglyphs, and is probably from a hieroglyph of a mace or fowl, representing the sound or the sound . This was borrowed to Phoenician, where it represented the sound , and seldom the vowel .\nIn Greek, two letters were adapted from the Phoenician waw. The letter was adapted, but split in two, with Digamma or wau \u27e8\u27e9 being adapted to represent , and the second one being Upsilon \u27e8\u27e9, which was originally adapted to represent , later fronted, becoming .\nIn Latin, a stemless variant shape of the upsilon was borrowed in early times as U, taking the form of modern-day V\u00a0\u2013 either directly from the Western Greek alphabet or from the Etruscan alphabet as an intermediary\u00a0\u2013 to represent the same sound, as well as the consonantal , \"num\"\u00a0\u2013 originally spelled \"\"\u00a0\u2013 was pronounced and \"via\" was pronounced . From the 1st century AD on, depending on Vulgar Latin dialect, consonantal developed into (kept in Spanish), then later to .\nDuring the late Middle Ages, two minuscule forms developed, which were both used for or the vowel . The pointed form \u27e8v\u27e9 was written at the beginning of a word, while a rounded form \u27e8u\u27e9 was used in the middle or end, regardless of sound. So whereas 'valour' and 'excuse' appeared as in modern printing, 'have' and 'upon' were printed 'haue' and 'vpon', respectively. The first recorded use of \u27e8u\u27e9 and \u27e8v\u27e9 as distinct letters is in a Gothic alphabet from 1386, where \u27e8v\u27e9 preceded \u27e8u\u27e9. Printers eschewed capital \u27e8U\u27e9 in favor of \u27e8V\u27e9 into the 17th century and the distinction between the two letters was not fully accepted by the French Academy until 1762. The rounded variant became the modern-day version of U and its former pointed form became V.\nUse in writing systems.\nEnglish.\nIn English, the letter \u27e8u\u27e9 has four main pronunciations. There are \"long\" and \"short\" pronunciations. Short \u27e8u\u27e9, found originally in closed syllables, most commonly represents (as in 'duck'), though it retains its old pronunciation after labial consonants in some words (as in 'put') and occasionally elsewhere (as in 'sugar'). Long \u27e8u\u27e9, found originally in words of French origin (the descendant of Old English long \u27e8u\u27e9 was respelled as \u27e8ou\u27e9), most commonly represents (as in 'mule'), reducing to after \u27e8r\u27e9 (as in 'rule'), \u27e8j\u27e9 (as in 'June') and sometimes (or optionally) after \u27e8l\u27e9 (as in 'lute'), and after additional consonants in American English (a do\u2013dew merger). (After \u27e8s\u27e9, have assimilated to in some words.)\nThe letter \u27e8u\u27e9 is used in the digraphs \u27e8au\u27e9 , \u27e8ou\u27e9 (various pronunciations, but usually ), and with the value of long \u27e8u\u27e9 in \u27e8eu\u27e9, \u27e8ue\u27e9, and in a few words \u27e8ui\u27e9 (as in 'fruit'). It often has the sound before a vowel in the sequences \u27e8qu\u27e9 (as in 'quick'), \u27e8gu\u27e9 (as in 'anguish'), and \u27e8su\u27e9 (as in 'suave'), though it is silent in final \u27e8que\u27e9 (as in 'unique') and in many words with \u27e8gu\u27e9 (as in 'guard').\nAdditionally, the letter \u27e8u\u27e9 is used in text messaging, the Internet, and other written slang to denote 'you', by virtue of both being pronounced .\nCertain varieties of the English language (i.e. British English, Canadian English, etc.) use the letter U in words such as \"colour\", \"labour\", \"valour\", etc. In American English, the letter is not used, and the words mentioned are spelled as \"color\" and so on.\nIt is the thirteenth most frequently used letter in the English language, with a frequency of about 2.8% in words.\nOther languages.\nIn most languages that use the Latin alphabet, \u27e8u\u27e9 represents the close back rounded vowel or a similar vowel.\nOther systems.\nThe International Phonetic Alphabet uses \u27e8\u27e9 for the close back rounded vowel.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31809", "revid": "207010", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31809", "title": "User Friendly", "text": "Webcomic by J. D. Frazer\nUser Friendly was a webcomic written by J. D. Frazer, also known by his pen name Illiad. Starting in 1997, the strip was one of the earliest webcomics to make its creator a living. The comic is set in a fictional internet service provider and draws humor from dealing with clueless users and geeky subjects. The comic ran seven days a week until 2009, when updates became sporadic, and since 2010 it had been in re-runs only. The webcomic was shut down in late February 2022, after an announcement from Frazer.\nPremise.\n\"User Friendly\" is set inside a fictional ISP, Columbia Internet. According to reviewer Eric Burns, the strip is set in a world where \"[u]sers were dumbasses who asked about cupholders that slid out of their computers, marketing executives were perverse and stupid and deserved humiliation, bosses were clueless and often naively cruel, and I.T. workers were somewhat shortsighted and misguided, but the last bastion of human reason... Every time we see Greg working, it's to deal with yet another annoying, self-important clueless user who hasn't gotten his brain around the digital world\". Although mostly gag-a-day, the comic often had ongoing running arcs and occasionally continuing character through-lines.\nCast.\nA.J. Garrett.\nA.J., Illiad's alter ego, represents \"the creative guy\" in the strip, maintaining and designing websites. As a web designer, he's uncomfortably crammed in that tiny crevice between the techies and the marketing people. This means he's not disliked by anyone, but they all look at him funny from time to time. A.J. is shy and sensitive, loves most computer games and nifty art, and has a big-brother relationship with the Dust Puppy. A.J. is terrified of grues and attempts to avoid them. He was released from the company on two separate occasions but returned shortly thereafter.\nIn the strip as of September 16, 2005, he and Miranda (another character) are dating. They also have previously dated, but split up over a misunderstanding.\nThe Chief.\nThe Chief is Columbia Internet's CEO. He is the leader of the techies and salespeople.\nIlliad based the character on a former boss, saying, \"The Chief is based on my business mentor. He was the vice president that I reported to back in the day. The Chief, like my mentor, is tall (!) and thin and sports a bushy ring around a bald crown, plus a very thick moustache.\" The Chief bears a superficial resemblance to the Pointy-Haired Boss of \"Dilbert\" fame. However, Illiad says that The Chief was not inspired by the \"Dilbert\" character. His personality is very different from the PHB, as well: he manages in the laissez-faire style, as opposed to the Marketing-based, micro-managing stance of the PHB. He has encouraged the office to standardise on Linux (much to Stef's chagrin).\nDust Puppy.\nBorn in a server from a combination of dust, lint, and quantum events, the Dust Puppy looks similar to a ball of dust and lint, with eyes, feet and an occasional big toothy smile. He was briefly absent from the strip after accidentally being blown with compressed air while sleeping inside a dusty server.\nAlthough the Dust Puppy is very innocent and unworldly, he plays a superb game of Quake. He also created an artificial intelligence named Erwin, with whom he has been known to do occasional song performances (or filks).\nDust Puppy is liked by most of the other characters, with the exceptions of Stef and the Dust Puppy's evil nemesis, the Crud Puppy.\nFirst appearance December 3, 1997.\nCrud Puppy.\nCrud Puppy (Lord Ignatius Crud) is the evil twin, born from the crud in Stef's keyboard; he is the nemesis of the Dust Puppy and sometimes takes the role of \"bad guy\" in the series. Examples include being the attorney/legal advisor of both Microsoft and then AOL or controlling a \"Thing\" suit in the Antarctic. He is most often seen in later strips in an Armani suit, usually sitting at the local bar with Cthulhu. The Crud Puppy first appeared in the strip on February 24, 1998.\nErwin.\nErwin first appeared in the January 25, 1998 strip. Erwin is a highly advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) created overnight during experimentation in artificial intelligence by the Dust Puppy, who was feeling kind of bored. Erwin is written in COBOL because Dust Puppy \"lost a bet\". Erwin passes the Turing test with flying colours, and has a dry sense of humour. He is an expert on any subject that is covered on the World Wide Web, such as Elvis sightings and alien conspiracies. Erwin is rather self-centered, and he is fond of mischievous pranks.\nOriginally, Erwin occupied the classic \"monitor and keyboard\" type computer with an x86 computer architecture, but was later given such residences as an iMac, a Palm III, a Coleco Adam on Mir, a Furby, a nuclear weapon guidance system, an SGI O2, a Hewlett-Packard Calculator (with reverse Polish notation, which meant that Erwin talked like Yoda for weeks afterward), a Lego Mindstorms construction, a Tamagotchi, a Segway, an IBM PC 5150, a \"Timber Wolf\"-class BattleMech, and an Internet-equipped toilet (with Dust Puppy being the toilet brush), as a punishment for insulting Hastur.\nGreg Flemming.\nGreg is in charge of Technical Support in the strip. In other words, he's the guy that customers whine to when something goes wrong, which drives him nuts. He blows off steam by playing visceral games and doing bad things to the salespeople. He's not a bad sort, but his grip on his sanity hovers somewhere between weak and non-existent, and he once worked for Microsoft http:// .\nMike Floyd.\nMike is the System Administrator of the strip and is responsible for the smooth running of the network at the office. He's bright but prone to fits of anxiety. His worst nightmare is being locked in a room with a sweaty Windows 95 programmer and no hacking weapons in sight. He loves hot ramen straight out of a styrofoam cup.\nMiranda Cornielle.\nMiranda is a trained systems technologist, an experienced UNIX sysadmin, and very, very female. Her technical abilities unnerve the other techs, but her obvious physical charms compel them to stare at her, except for Pitr, who is convinced she is evil. Although she has few character flaws, she does express sadistic tendencies, especially towards marketers and lusers. Miranda finds Dust Puppy adorable.\nShe and A.J. are dating as of September 16, 2005, although she was previously frustrated by his inability to express himself and his love for her. This comes after years of missed opportunities and misunderstandings, such as when A.J. poured his feelings into an email and Miranda mistook it for the ILOVEYOU email worm and deleted it unread.\nPitr Dubovich.\nPitr is the administrator of the Columbia Internet server and a self-proclaimed Linux guru. He suddenly began to speak with a fake Slavic accent as part of his program to \"Become an Evil Genius.\" He has almost succeeded in taking over the planet several times. His sworn enemy is Sid, who seems to outdo him at every turn. Pitr's achievements include: making the world's (second) strongest coffee, merging Coca-Cola, Pepsi into Pitr-Cola and making Columbia Internet millions with a nuclear weapon purchased from Russia, and the infamous Vigor text editor. He briefly worked for Google, nearly succeeding in world domination, but was released from there and returned to Columbia Internet. Despite his vast efforts to become the ultimate evil character, his lack of illheartedness prevents him from reaching such achievement.\nSid Dabster.\nSid is the oldest of the geeks and very knowledgeable. His advanced age gives him the upper hand against Pitr, whom he has outdone on several occasions, including in a coffee-brewing competition and in a round of \"Jeopardy!\" that he hacked in his own favor. Unlike Pitr, he has no ambitions for world domination per se, but he is a friend of Hastur and Cthulhu (based on the H. P. Lovecraft Mythos characters). He was hired in September 2000 and he had formerly worked for Hewlett-Packard, with ten years' experience It is his habit, unlike the other techs, to dress to a somewhat professional degree; when he first came to work, Smiling Man, the head accountant, expressed shock at the fact that Sid was wearing his usual blue business suit. He is also a fan of old technology, having grown up in the age of TECO, PDP-6es, the original VT100, FORTRAN, IBM 3270 and the IBM 5150; one could, except for the decent taste in clothing, categorise him as a Real Programmer. He was once a cannabis smoker, as contrasted with the rest of the technological staff, who prefer caffeine (Greg in the form of cola, Miranda in the form of espresso). This had the unfortunate effect of causing lung cancer and he was treated by an oncologist. He has since recovered from the cancer and was told he has another 20 years or so to live.\nPearl Dabster.\nSid Dabster's beautiful daughter. The character appeared for the first time in the strip of Aug. 30, 2001. Pearl is often seen getting the better of the boys. She is the antagonist of Miranda, and occasionally the object of Pitr's affections, much to the chagrin of Sid. Some people (both in strip and in the real world) wrongly assume that the character was named after the scripting language PERL. While this may be the true intention of the author, in the script timeline, is shown to be an error based on wordplay.\nSmiling Man.\nThe Smiling Man is the company comptroller. He is in charge of accounts, finances, and expenditures. He smiles all day for no reason. This in itself is enough to terrify most normal human beings (even via phone). However, the Dust Puppy, the \"Evilphish\", a delirious Stef, and a consultant in a purple suit have managed to get him to stop smiling first. His favourite wallpaper is a large, complex, and utterly meaningless spreadsheet.\nStef Murky.\nStef is the strip's Corporate Sales Manager. He runs most of the marketing efforts within the firm, often selling things before they exist. He is a stereotypical marketer, with an enormous ego and a condescending attitude toward the techies; they detest him and frequently retaliate with pranks. He sucks at \"Quake\", even once managing to die at the startup screen in \"Quake III Arena\"; in addition, he manages to die by falling into lava in any game that contains it, including games where it is normally impossible to step in said lava. Although he admires Microsoft and frequently defends their marketing tactics, infuriating the techies, he has a real problem with Microsoft salesmen, probably because they make much more money than he does. His attitude towards women is decidedly chauvinist; he lusts after Miranda who will not have anything to do with him. Stef is definitely gormless, as demonstrated on January 14, 2005.\nProduction.\nIn a 2008 article, reviewer Eric Burns said that as best he could tell, Frazer had produced strips seven days a week, without missing an update for, at that time, almost 11 years. Frazer would draw several days' worth of comics in advance, but the Sunday comic \u2013 based on current events and in color \u2013 was always drawn for immediate release and did not relate to the regular storyline.\nThe website for \"User Friendly\" included other features such as Link of the Day and Iambe Intimate &amp; Interactive, a weekly editorial written under the pseudonym \"Iambe\".\nIn late 1999, \"User Friendly\" and \"Sluggy Freelance\" swapped a character (A.J. and Torg).\nThe strip and Loki Software teamed up for player skin and custom level contest for \"Quake III Arena\" in 2000. A Flash cartoon based on the series was also produced.\nAuthor.\nJ. D. Frazer was born in 1969. He began his career in law enforcement and served as a corrections officer, hoping eventually to join the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, but he changed his mind, leaving law enforcement to pursue more creative endeavours. He worked as a game designer, production manager, art director, project manager, Web services manager, writer, creative director, and cartoonist. As of 2014[ [update]] he lived in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.\nCreation.\nFrazer started writing \"User Friendly\" in 1997. According to Frazer, he started cartooning at age 12. He had tried to get into cartooning through syndicates with a strip called \"Dust Puppies\", but it was rejected by six syndicates. Later, while working at an ISP, he drew some cartoons which his co-workers enjoyed. He then drew a month's worth of cartoons and posted them online. After that, he quit his job and then worked on the comic.\nSuccess.\nWriter Xavier Xerxes said that in the very early days of webcomics, Frazer was probably one of the bigger success stories and was one of the first to make a living from a webcomic. Eric Burns attributed initial success of the comic to the makeup of the early internet, saying, \"In 1997, a disproportionate number of internet users... were in the I.T. Industry. When \"User Friendly\" began gathering momentum, there wasn't just little to nothing like it on the web -- it appealed and spoke to a much larger percentage of the internet reading audience than mainstream society would support outside of that filter... in the waning years of the 20th Century, it was a safe bet that if someone had an internet connection in the first place, they'd find \"User Friendly\" funny.\"\nOn April Fools' Day 1999, the site appeared to be shut down permanently after a third party sued. In future years, the April 1st cartoon referenced back to the disruption that was caused.\nIn a 2001 interview, Frazer said that he was not handling fame well, and pretended not to be famous in order to keep his life normal. He said that his income came from sponsorship, advertising, and sales of printed collections. These compilations have been published by O'Reilly Media.\nSince 2000, \"User Friendly\" had been published in a variety of newspapers, including The National Post in Canada and the Linux Journal magazine.\nIdeas.\nIn a 2001 interview, Frazer estimated that about 40% of strip ideas came from reader submissions, and occasionally he would get submissions that he would use \"unmodified\". He also said that he educated himself on the operating system BSD in order to make informed jokes about it.\nIn 2009, Frazer was found to be copying punchlines found in the MetaFilter community. After one poster found a comment on MetaFilter that was similar to a \"User Friendly\" comic, users searched and found several other examples. Initially, Frazer posted on MetaFilter saying \"I get a flurry of submissions and one-liners every week, and I haven't checked many of them at all, because I rarely had to in the past\" but later admitted that he had taken quotes directly from the site. On his website, Frazer said, \"I offered no attribution or asked for permission [for these punchlines], over the last couple of years I've infringed on the expression of ideas of some (who I think are) clever people. Plagiarized. My hypocrisy seems to know no bounds, as an infamous gunman was once heard saying. I sincerely apologize to my readers and to the original authors. I offer no excuses and accept full blame and responsibility. As a result, I'll be modifying the cartoons in question. No, it won't happen again. Yes, I've immersed myself in mild acid.\"\nWhile published books still contain at least one cartoon with a punchline taken from MetaFilter, Frazer has removed these cartoons from the website, or updated them to quote and credit the source of the punchlines, and fans searched through the archives to ensure that none of the other punchlines have been plagiarized.\nSuspension.\nThe strip went on hiatus from June 1, 2009 to August 2009 for personal reasons. In this period, previous strips were re-posted.\nA second hiatus lasted from December 1, 2009 until August 1, 2010, again for personal reasons. New cartoons, supplied by the community as part of a competition, started to appear as of August 2, 2010.\nFrom November 1, 2010 through November 21, 2010, Illiad published a special \"Remembrance Day story arc\", and stated that it is \"vague and at this point random\" what will happen to the strip afterwards, that \"going daily again is highly unlikely\", but that \"there are still many stories that I want to tell through UF, over time\". Since then, previous comics have been re-posted on a daily basis.\nAfter the de facto stop of publishing new content, three one-off comics commemoration special occasions were published:\nOn 24 February 2022, Illiad announced that the website would be shut down soon, \"at the end of this month. If not, it won't be much later than that.\"\nAt approximately midnight Pacific Time on the evening of 28 February 2022, the website was shut down.\nReviews.\n\"User Friendly\" has received mixed reviews over the years.\nIn a 2008 review, Eric Burns of Websnark called it a \"damned good comic strip\", but felt it had several problems. Burns felt that the strip had not evolved in several years, saying \"his strip is exactly the same today as it was in 1998... the same characters, the same humor, the same punchlines, the same punching bags as before.\" Burns said that characters learn no lessons, and that \"[i]f Frazer uses copy and paste to put his characters in, he's been using the same clip art for the entire 21st century.\" Burns also criticised the stereotypical depiction of idiotic computer users as outdated. But fundamentally, Burns found the strip funny, saying anyone who had worked IT would likely find it funny, and even those who had not will find something in it amusing. Burns felt that some criticism of \"User Friendly\" came from seeing it as general webcomic, rather than one targeted at a specific audience of old-school IT geeks, and he considered that the targeted approach was a good business model.\nWriter T Campbell declared JD Frazer's work as \"ow[ing] a heavy debt to [Scott] Adams, but his 'nerdcore' was a purer sort: the jokes were often for nerds ONLY-- NO NON-TECHIES ALLOWD [\"sic\"].\" He continued \"He wasn't the first webtoonist to target his audience so precisely, but he was the first to do it on a daily schedule, and that kind of single-minded dedication is something most techies could appreciate. User Friendly set the tone for nerdcore strips to follow.\" Time magazine called \"User Friendly\" \"a strip in the wry, verbal vein of Doonesbury...the humor is a combination of pop culture references and inside jokes straight outta the IT department.\" The strip was among the most notable of a wave of similar strips, including \"Help Desk\" by Christopher B. Wright, \"General Protection Fault\" by Jeffrey T. Darlington, \"The PC Weenies\" by Krishna Sadasivam, \"Geek &amp; Poke\" by Oliver Widder, \"Working Daze\" by John Zakour, and \"The Joy of Tech\" by Liza Schmalcel and Bruce Evans.\nComic writer and artist Joe Zabel said that User Friendly \"may be one of the earliest webcomics manifestation of the use of templates... renderings of the characters that are cut and pasted directly into the comic strip... I think the main significance of User Friendly is that in 1997 it was really, really crude in every respect. Horrible artwork, terrible storyline, zilch characterization, and extremely dull, obvious jokes. And yet it was a smash hit! I think this demonstrates that the public will embrace just about anything if it's free and the circumstances are right. And it indicates that new internet users of the time were really hungry, downright starving, for entertainment... his current work [speaking in 2005] is comparatively slick and professional. But I suspect that his early work had enormous influence, because it encouraged thousands of people with few skills and little talent to jump into the webcomics field.\" Zabel also credited User Friendly's success in part to its \"series mascot\", Dust Puppy, saying that \"the popular gag-a-day cartoons almost always have some kind of mascot.\"\nThe webcomic Penny Arcade produced a strip in 1999 just to criticise Frazer, saying \"people will pass up steak once a week for crap every day.\" They also criticized the commercialism of the enterprise. By contrast, CNET included it on 2007 a list of \"sidesplitting tech comics\", Mashable included it in a 2009 list of the 20 best webcomics and Polygon listed it as one of the most influential webcomics of all time in 2018. It has also been noted by FromDev, Brainz, RiskOptics, DondeQ2, and Pingdom. CBR.com concluded the comic had aged poorly in a 2023 rundown.\nLawrence I. Charters appreciated the nature of the titles used for the published books. Francis Glassborow cited the specificity of the humour, which also lead Retro Activity to find the strip \"difficult to recommend\" along with the limited art style. Mike Kaltschnee also mentioned the weakness of the art, but was impressed at Illiad maintaining publication of a strip every day. \"Webcomics: The Influence and Continuation of the Comix Revolution\" described how the strip represented the counter-cultural aspects of the open-source software movement. Dustin Puryear observed how the strip represents the conflicts between the computer literate and newer less informed users. Christine Moellenberndt wrote about the online community spawned around the comic strip.\nIn 2007, \"User Friendly\" was part of an exhibit at The Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art called \"Infinite Canvas: The Art of Webcomics\".\nBibliography.\nSeveral cartoon compilations have been published:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nStory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The term was coined when United States Air Force (USAF) investigations into flying saucers found too broad a range of shapes reported to consider them all saucers or discs. UFOs are also known as unidentified aerial phenomena or unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP). Upon investigation, most UFOs are identified as known objects or atmospheric phenomena, while a small number remain unexplained.\nWhile unusual sightings in the sky have been reported since at least the 3rd century BC, UFOs became culturally prominent after World War II, escalating during the Space Age. Studies and investigations into UFO reports conducted by governments (such as Project Blue Book in the United States and Project Condign in the United Kingdom), as well as by organisations and individuals have occurred over the years without confirmation of the fantastical claims of small but vocal groups of ufologists who favour unconventional or pseudoscientific hypotheses, often claiming that UFOs are evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence, technologically advanced cryptids, interdimensional contact or future time travelers. After decades of promotion of such ideas by believers and in popular media, the kind of evidence required to solidly support such claims has not been forthcoming. Scientists and skeptic organizations such as the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry have provided prosaic explanations for UFOs, namely that they are caused by natural phenomena, human technology, delusions, and hoaxes. Although certain beliefs surrounding UFOs have inspired parts of new religions, social scientists have identified the ongoing interest and storytelling surrounding UFOs as a modern example of folklore and mythology understandable with psychosocial explanations.\nThe problems of temporarily or permanently non-knowable anomalous phenomenon or perceived objects in flight is part of the philosophical subject epistemology.\nThe U.S. government has two entities dedicated to UFO data collection and analysis: NASA's UAP independent study team and the Department of Defense All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTerminology.\nDuring the late 1940s and through the 1950s, UFOs were often called \"flying saucers\" or \"flying discs\" based on reporting of the Kenneth Arnold incident. \"Unidentified flying object\" (UFO) has been in-use since 1947. The acronym \"UFO\" was coined by Captain Edward J. Ruppelt for the USAF. He wrote, \"Obviously the term 'flying saucer' is misleading when applied to objects of every conceivable shape and performance. For this reason the military prefers the more general, if less colorful, name: unidentified flying objects. UFO\". The term UFO became widespread during the 1950s, at first in technical literature, but later in popular use. \"Unidentified aerial phenomena\" (UAP) first appeared in the late 1960s. UAP has seen increasing usage in the 21st century due to negative cultural associations with \"UFO\". UAP is sometimes expanded as \"unidentified anomalous phenomenon\".\nWhile technically a \"UFO\" refers to any unidentified flying object, in modern popular culture the term UFO has generally become synonymous with alien spacecraft. The term \"extra-terrestrial vehicle\" (ETV) is sometimes used to separate this explanation of UFOs from totally earthbound explanations.\nIdentification.\nStudies show that after careful investigation, the majority of UFOs can be identified as ordinary objects or phenomena. The 1952\u20131955 study for the USAF used the following categories: \"Balloon; Astronomical; Aircraft; Light phenomenon; Birds, Clouds, dust, etc.; Insufficient information; Psychological manifestations; Unknown; and Other\". Identified sources of UFO reports are:\nAn individual 1979 study by CUFOS researcher Allan Hendry found, as did other investigations, that fewer than one percent of cases he investigated were hoaxes and most sightings were actually honest misidentifications of prosaic phenomena. Hendry attributed most of these to inexperience or misperception. Astronomer Andrew Fraknoi rejected the hypothesis that UFOs are extraterrestrial spacecraft and responded to the \"onslaught of credulous coverage\" in books, films and entertainment by teaching his students to apply critical thinking to such claims, advising them that \"being a good scientist is not unlike being a good detective\". According to Fraknoi, UFO reports \"might at first seem mysterious\", but \"the more you investigate, the more likely you are to find that there is LESS to these stories than meets the eye\".\nHistory.\nEarly history before the 20th century.\nPeople have always observed the sky and have sometimes seen what, to some, appeared to be unusual sights including phenomena as varied as comets, bright meteors, one or more of the five planets that can be readily seen with the naked eye, planetary conjunctions, and atmospheric optical phenomena such as parhelia and lenticular clouds. One particularly famous example is Halley's Comet: first recorded by Chinese astronomers in 240 BC and possibly as early as 467 BC as a strange and unknown \"guest light\" in the sky. As a bright comet that visits the inner solar system every 76 years, it was often identified as a unique isolated event in ancient historical documents whose authors were unaware that it was a repeating phenomenon. Such accounts in history often were treated as supernatural portents, angels, or other religious omens. While UFO enthusiasts have sometimes commented on the narrative similarities between certain religious symbols in medieval paintings and UFO reports, the canonical and symbolic character of such images is documented by art historians placing more conventional religious interpretations on such images.\nSome examples of pre-contemporary reports about unusual aerial phenomena include:\n20th century and after.\nIn the Pacific and European theatres during World War II, round, glowing fireballs known as \"foo fighters\" were reported by Allied and Axis pilots. Some explanations for these sightings included St. Elmo's fire, the planet Venus, hallucinations from oxygen deprivation, and German secret weapons (specifically rockets). In 1946, more than 2,000 reports were collected, primarily by the Swedish military, of unidentified aerial objects over the Scandinavian nations, along with isolated reports from France, Portugal, Spain, Italy, and Greece. The objects were referred to as \"Russian hail\" (and later as \"ghost rockets\") because it was thought the mysterious objects were possibly Russian tests of captured German V1 or V2 rockets, but most were identified as natural phenomena as meteors.\nMany scholars, especially those arguing for the psychosocial UFO hypothesis, have noted that UFO characteristics reported after the first widely publicized modern sighting by Kenneth Arnold in 1947 resembled a host of science fiction tropes from earlier in the century.\nBy most accounts, the popular UFO craze in the US began with a media frenzy surrounding the reports on June 24, 1947, of a civilian pilot named Kenneth Arnold who described seeing \"a group of bat-like aircraft flying in formation at high speeds\" near Mount Rainier that he said were \"moving like a saucer would if skipped across water\" which led to headlines about \"flying saucers\" and \"flying discs\". Only weeks after Arnold's story was reported in 1947, Gallup published a poll asking people in the United States what the \"flying saucers\" might be. Already, 90% had heard of the new term. However, as reported by historian Greg Eghanian, \"a majority either had no idea what they could be or thought that witnesses were mistaken\" while \"visitors from space were not initially among the options that anyone had in mind, and Gallup didn't even mention if anyone surveyed brought up aliens.\nWithin weeks, reports of flying saucer sightings became a daily occurrence with one particularly famous example being the Roswell incident in 1947 where remnants of a downed observation balloon were recovered by a farmer and confiscated by military personnel. UFO enthusiasts in the early 1950s started to organize local \"saucer clubs\" modeled after science fiction fan clubs of the 1930s and 1940s, with some growing to national and international prominence within a decade. In 1950, three influential books were published\u2014Donald Keyhoe's \"The Flying Saucers Are Real\", Frank Scully's \"Behind the Flying Saucers\", and Gerald Heard's \"The Riddle of the Flying Saucers\". Each guilelessly proposed that the extraterrestrial UFO hypothesis was the correct explanation and that the visits were in response to detonations of atomic weapons. These books also introduced Americans to, as Eghanian puts it, \"the crusading whistleblower dedicated to breaking the silence over the alien origins of unidentified flying objects\". Media accounts and speculation ran rampant in the U.S., especially in connection to the 1952 UFO scare in Washington, D.C. so that, by 1953, the intelligence officials (Robertson Panel) worried that \"genuine incursions\" by enemy aircraft \"over U.S. territory could be lost in a maelstrom of kooky hallucination\" of UFO reports. A Trendex survey in August 1957, ten years after the Arnold incident, reported that over 25% of the U.S. public \"believed unidentified flying objects could be from outer space\". The cultural phenomenon showed up within some intellectual works such as the 1959 publication of \"Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Sky\" by Carl Jung, a Swiss psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who founded analytical psychology.\nStarting in 1947, the U.S. Air Force began to record and investigated UFO reports with Project Sign looking into \"more than 250 cases\" from 1947 to 1949. It was replaced by Project Grudge up through 1951. In the third U.S. Air Force program, from March 1952 to its termination in December 1969, \"the U.S. Air Force cataloged 12,618 sightings of UFOs as part of what is now known as Project Blue Book\". In the late 1950s, public pressure mounted for a full declassification of all UFO records, but the CIA played a role in refusing to allow this. This sense was not universal in the CIA, however, as fellow NICAP official Donald E. Keyhoe wrote that Vice Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter, the first director of the CIA, \"wanted public disclosure of UFO evidence\". Official U.S. Air Force interest in UFO reports went on hiatus in 1969 after a study by the University of Colorado led by Edward U. Condon and known as the Condon Report concluded \"that nothing has come from the study of UFOs in the past 21 years that has added to scientific knowledge\" and that further time investigating UFO reports \"cannot be justified\".\nFrom the 1960s to 1990s, UFOs were part of American popular culture's obsession with the supernatural and paranormal. In 1961, the first alien abduction account was sensationalized when Barney and Betty Hill underwent hypnosis after seeing a UFO and reported recovered memories of their experience that became ever more elaborate as the years went by. In 1966, 5% of Americans reported to Gallup that \"they had at some time seen something they thought was a 'flying saucer'\", 96% said \"they had heard or read about flying saucers\", and 46% of these \"thought they were 'something real' rather than just people's imagination\". Responding to UFO enthusiasm, there have always been consistent yet less popular efforts made at debunking many of the claims, and at times the media was enlisted including a 1966 TV special, \"UFO: Friend, Foe or Fantasy?\", in which Walter Cronkite \"patiently\" explained to viewers that UFOs were fantasy. Cronkite enlisted Carl Sagan and J. Allen Hynek, who told Cronkite, \"To this time, there is no valid scientific proof that we have been visited by spaceships\".\nSuch attempts to disenchant the zeitgeist were not very successful at tamping down the mania. Keith Kloor notes that the \"allure of flying saucers\" remained popular with the public into the 1970s, spurring production of such sci-fi films, as \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" and \"Alien\", which \"continued to stoke public fascination\". Meanwhile, Leonard Nimoy narrated a popular occult and mystery TV series \"In Search of...\" while daytime talk shows of Mike Douglas, Merv Griffin, and Phil Donahue featured interviews with alien abductees and people who credulously reported stories about UFOs . In the 1980s and 1990s, UFO stories featured in such pulp \"true crime\" serials as \"Unsolved Mysteries\" while the 33 Volume Time-Life series \"Mysteries of the Unknown\" which featured UFO stories sold some 700,000 copies. Kloor writes that by the late 1990s, \"other big UFO subthemes had been prominently introduced into pop culture, such as the abduction phenomenon and government conspiracy narrative, via best-selling books and, of course, \"The X-Files\"\".\nEghigian notes that, by this point, the UFO problem had become \"far more interesting to ponder than to actually solve.\" Interest was particularly fevered in the 1990s with the publicity surrounding the television broadcast of an \"Alien autopsy\" video marketed as \"real footage\" but later admitted to be a staged \"re-enactment\". Eghigian writes that \"there had always been outlier abduction reports dating back to the '50s and '60s\" but that in the '80s and '90s \"the floodgates opened, and with them a new generation of UFO advocates\". Leaders among them were the artist Budd Hopkins, horror writer Whitley Strieber, historian David Jacobs, and Harvard psychiatrist John Mack. They all defended the \"veracity of those claiming to have been kidnapped, examined, and experimented upon by beings from another world\", writes Eghigian, as \"new missionaries who simultaneously played the role of investigator, therapist, and advocate to their vulnerable charges\". Eghigian says that Mack \"signaled both the culmination and end of the headiest days of alien abduction\". When Mack began working with and publishing accounts of abductees\u2014or \"experiencers\", as he called them\u2014in the early 1990s, he brought a sense of legitimacy to \"the study of extraterrestrial captivity\". By the late 1990s, however, the Harvard Medical School initiated a review of his position which allowed him to retain tenure. However, after this review, as the review board chairman Arnold Relman later put it, Mack was \"not taken seriously by his colleagues anymore\". Claims of alien abduction have continued, but no other clinicians would continue to speak of them as real in any sense. Nonetheless, these ideas persisted in popular opinion. According to a 1996 poll by \"Newsweek\", 20% of Americans believed that UFOs were more likely to be proof of alien life than to have a natural scientific explanation.\nIn December 2017, a new round of media attention started when \"The New York Times\" broke the story of the secret Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program that was funded from 2007 to 2012 with $22 million spent on the program. Following this story, along with a series of sensationalized Pentagon UFO videos leaked by members of the program who became convinced that UFOs were genuine mysteries worth investigating, there was an increase in mainstream attention to UFO stories. In July 2021, Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb announced the creation of his Galileo Project which intended to use high-tech astronomical equipment to seek evidence of extraterrestrial artifacts in space and possibly within Earth's atmosphere. This was followed closely by the publication of Loeb's book \"Extraterrestrial\", in which he argued that the first interstellar comet ever observed, 'Oumuamua, might be an artificial light sail made by an alien civilization. Two government sponsored programs, NASA's UAP independent study team and the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office were charged in part by Congressional fiat to investigate UFO claims more fully, adopting the new moniker \"unexplained aerial phenomenon\" (UAP) to avoid associations with past sensationalism. On 17 May 2022, members of the United States House Intelligence Subcommittee on Counterterrorism, Counterintelligence and Counterproliferation held congressional hearings with top military officials to discuss military reports of UAPs. It was the first public congressional hearing into UFO sightings in the US in over 50 years. Another Congressional hearing took place on July 26, 2023, featuring the whistleblower claims of former U.S. Air Force (USAF) officer and intelligence official David Grusch.\nA Harris Poll in 2009 found that 32% of Americans \"believe in UFOs\". A \"National Geographic\" study in June 2012 found that 36% of Americans believe UFOs exist and that 10% thought that they had spotted one. In June 2021 a Pew research poll found that 51% in the United States thought that UFOs reported by people in the military were likely to be evidence of intelligent life from beyond the Earth. In August 2021, Gallup, with a question not specific to military reports, only found that 41% of adults believed some UFOs involve alien spacecraft from other planets. This Gallup poll showed 44% of men and 38% of women believed this. This average of 41% in 2021 was up from 33% in a 2019 Gallup poll with the same question. Gallup further found that college graduates went in 2019 from being the least likely educational group to believe this to being on par in 2021 with adults who have no college education. An October 2022 poll by \"YouGov\" only found that 34% of Americans believe that UFOs are likely to involve alien life forms.\nHistorian Greg Eghigian wrote in August 2021 that \"over the last fifty years, the mutual antagonism between paranormal believers and skeptics has largely framed discussion about unidentified flying objects\" and that \"it often gets personal\" with those taking seriously the prospect that UFOs are extraterrestrial in origin dismissing those who consider UFOs to be worth studying as \"narrow-minded, biased, obstinate, and cruel\" while the skeptics brushed off \"devotees\" as \"na\u00efve, ignorant, gullible, and downright dangerous\". Such \"mudslinging over convictions is certainly familiar to historians of religion, a domain of human existence marked by deep divisions over interpretations of belief\", and science too has found itself engaged increasing amounts of \"boundary work\" (which is \"asserting and reasserting the borders between legitimate and illegitimate scientific research and ideas, between what may and what may not refer to itself as science\") with regard to UFO questions. Eghigian points out our current \"stark divide did not happen overnight, and its roots lie in the postwar decades, in a series of events that\u2014with their news coverage, grainy images, celebrity crusaders, exasperated skeptics, unsatisfying military statements, and accusations of a government cover-up\u2014foreshadow our present moment\".\nUFOs have been taken up by religious studies scholars in various scholarly books. Jeffrey Kripal, chair of the Department of Religion at Rice University, has said that \"both the material and the mental dimensions [of UFOs] are incredibly important to get a sense of the full picture\". As Adrian Horton writes \"from \"The X-Files\" to \"Men in Black\", \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" to \"Star Wars\" to Marvel, Hollywood has for decades provided an engrossing feedback loop for interest in the extraterrestrial: a reflection of our fears and capaciousness, whose ubiquitous popularity has in turn fueled more interest in UFOs as perennially compelling entertainment tropes not to be taken seriously\". Horton observes that these \"alien movies have generally reflected shifting cultural anxieties, from the existential terror of nuclear war to foreign enslavement to loss of bodily control\". American entertainment has explored both \"hostile aliens\" as well as the \"benevolent, world-expanding encounters\" seen in films such as Steven Spielberg's \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" and \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\". In her research on the relationship of media to UFO beliefs, Diana Walsh Pasulka, a professor of philosophy and religion at the University of North Carolina, says that what is seen on a screen, \"if it conforms to certain criteria, is interpreted as real, even if it is not real and even if one knows it is not real\" and that \"screen images embed themselves in one's brain and memories\" in ways that \"can determine how one views one's past and even determine one's future behaviors\".\nInvestigations of reports.\nUFOs have been subject to investigations over the years that varied widely in scope and scientific rigor. Governments or independent academics in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, Peru, France, Belgium, Sweden, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, Mexico, Spain, and the Soviet Union are known to have investigated UFO reports at various times. No official government investigation has ever publicly concluded that UFOs are indisputably real, physical objects, extraterrestrial in origin, or of concern to national defense.\nAmong the best known government studies are the ghost rockets investigation by the Swedish military (1946\u20131947), Project Blue Book, previously Project Sign and Project Grudge, conducted by the USAF from 1947 until 1969, the secret U.S. Army/Air Force Project Twinkle investigation into green fireballs (1948\u20131951), the secret USAF Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14 by the Battelle Memorial Institute, and the Brazilian Air Force's 1977 \"Opera\u00e7\u00e3o Prato\" (Operation Saucer). France has had an ongoing investigation (GEPAN/SEPRA/GEIPAN) within its space agency Centre national d'\u00e9tudes spatiales (CNES) since 1977; the government of Uruguay has had a similar investigation since 1989.\nAmericas.\nBrazil (1952\u20132016).\nOn October 31, 2008, the National Archives of Brazil began receiving from the Aeronautical Documentation and History Center part of the documentation of the Brazilian Air Force regarding the investigation of the appearance of UFOs in Brazil. Currently, this collection gathers cases between 1952 and 2016.\nChile (c. 1968).\nIn 1968, the SEFAA (previously CEFAA) began receiving case reports of the general public, civil aviators and the Chilean Air Force regarding the sightings or the appearance of UFOs in Chile, the initial work was an initiative of Sergio Bravo Flores who led the Chilean Committee for the Study of Unidentified Space Phenomena, supported even by the Chilean Scientific Society. Currently, the organization changed its denomination to SEFAA and its a department of the DGAC(Chile) which in turn depends on the Chilean Air Force.\nCanada (c. 1950).\nIn Canada, the Department of National Defence has dealt with reports, sightings and investigations of UFOs across Canada. In addition to conducting investigations into crop circles in Duhamel, Alberta, it still considers \"unsolved\" the Falcon Lake incident in Manitoba and the Shag Harbour UFO incident in Nova Scotia.\nEarly Canadian studies included Project Magnet (1950\u20131954) and Project Second Storey (1952\u20131954), supported by the Defence Research Board.\nSynopsis.\nU.S. investigations into UFOs include:\nIn addition to these, thousands of documents released under FOIA also indicate that many U.S. intelligence agencies collected (and still collect) information on UFOs. These agencies include the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), FBI, CIA, National Security Agency (NSA), as well as military intelligence agencies of the Army and U.S. Navy, in addition to the Air Force.\nUSAAF and FBI response to the 1947 sightings.\nFollowing the large U.S. surge in sightings in June and early July 1947, on July 9, 1947, United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) intelligence, in cooperation with the FBI, began a formal investigation into selected sightings with characteristics that could not be immediately rationalized, such as Kenneth Arnold's. The USAAF used \"all of its top scientists\" to determine whether \"such a phenomenon could, in fact, occur\". The research was \"being conducted with the thought that the flying objects might be a celestial phenomenon,\" or that \"they might be a foreign body mechanically devised and controlled.\" Three weeks later in a preliminary defense estimate, the air force investigation decided that, \"This 'flying saucer' situation is not all imaginary or seeing too much in some natural phenomenon. Something is really flying around.\"\nA further review by the intelligence and technical divisions of the Air Materiel Command at Wright Field reached the same conclusion. It reported that \"the phenomenon is something real and not visionary or fictitious,\" and there were disc-shaped objects, metallic in appearance, as big as man-made aircraft. They were characterized by \"extreme rates of climb [and] maneuverability\", general lack of noise, absence of a trail, occasional formation flying, and \"evasive\" behavior \"when sighted or contacted by friendly aircraft and radar\", suggesting a controlled craft. It was therefore recommended in late September 1947 that an official Air Force investigation be set up. It was also recommended that other government agencies should assist in the investigation.\nUSAF.\nProjects Sign (1947\u20131949), Grudge (1948\u20131951), and Blue Book (1951\u20131970).\nProject Sign's final report, published in early 1949, stated that while some UFOs appeared to represent actual aircraft, there was not enough data to determine their origin.\nThe Air Force's Project Sign was created at the end of 1947, and was one of the earliest government studies to come to a secret extraterrestrial conclusion. In August 1948, Sign investigators wrote a top-secret intelligence estimate to that effect, but the Air Force Chief of Staff Hoyt Vandenberg ordered it destroyed. The existence of this suppressed report was revealed by several insiders who had read it, such as astronomer and USAF consultant J. Allen Hynek and Capt. Edward J. Ruppelt, the first head of the USAF's Project Blue Book.\nAnother highly classified U.S. study was conducted by the CIA's Office of Scientific Investigation (OS/I) in the latter half of 1952 in response to orders from the National Security Council (NSC). This study concluded UFOs were real physical objects of potential threat to national security. One OS/I memo to the CIA Director (DCI) in December read that \"the reports of incidents convince us that there is something going on that must have immediate attention\u00a0... Sightings of unexplained objects at great altitudes and traveling at high speeds in the vicinity of major U.S. defense installations are of such a nature that they are not attributable to natural phenomena or any known types of aerial vehicles.\"\nThe matter was considered so urgent that OS/I drafted a memorandum from the DCI to the NSC proposing that the NSC establish an investigation of UFOs as a priority project throughout the intelligence and the defense research and development community. It also urged the DCI to establish an external research project of top-level scientists, now known as the Robertson Panel to analyze the problem of UFOs. The OS/I investigation was called off after the Robertson Panel's negative conclusions in January 1953.\nProject Sign was dismantled and became Project Grudge at the end of 1948. Angered by the low quality of investigations by Grudge, the Air Force Director of Intelligence reorganized it as Project Blue Book in late 1951, placing Ruppelt in charge. J. Allen Hynek, a trained astronomer who served as a scientific advisor for Project Blue Book, was initially skeptical of UFO reports, but eventually came to the conclusion that many of them could not be satisfactorily explained and was highly critical of what he described as \"the cavalier disregard by Project Blue Book of the principles of scientific investigation\". Leaving government work, he founded the privately funded CUFOS, to whose work he devoted the rest of his life. Other private groups studying the phenomenon include the MUFON, a grassroots organization whose investigator's handbooks go into great detail on the documentation of alleged UFO sightings.\nUSAF Regulation 200-2 (1953\u20131954).\n, issued in 1953 and 1954, defined an Unidentified Flying Object (\"UFOB\") as \"any airborne object which by performance, aerodynamic characteristics, or unusual features, does not conform to any presently known aircraft or missile type, or which cannot be positively identified as a familiar object.\" The regulation also said UFOBs were to be investigated as a \"possible threat to the security of the United States\" and \"to determine technical aspects involved.\" The regulation went on to say that \"it is permissible to inform news media representatives on UFOB's when the object is positively identified as a familiar object\" but added: \"For those objects which are not explainable, only the fact that ATIC [Air Technical Intelligence Center] will analyze the data is worthy of release, due to many unknowns involved.\"\nBlue Book and the Condon Committee (1968\u20131970).\nA public research effort conducted by the Condon Committee for the USAF and published as the Condon Report arrived at a negative conclusion in 1968. Blue Book closed down in 1970, using the Condon Committee's negative conclusion as a rationale, thus ending official Air Force UFO investigations. However, a 1969 USAF document, known as the Bolender memo, along with later government documents, revealed that non-public U.S. government UFO investigations continued after 1970. The Bolender memo first stated that \"reports of unidentified flying objects that could affect national security\u00a0... are not part of the Blue Book system,\" indicating that more serious UFO incidents already were handled outside the public Blue Book investigation. The memo then added, \"reports of UFOs which could affect national security would continue to be handled through the standard Air Force procedures designed for this purpose.\"\nIn the late 1960s, a chapter on UFOs in the Space Sciences course at the U.S. Air Force Academy gave serious consideration to possible extraterrestrial origins. When word of the curriculum became public, in 1970, the Air Force issued a statement to the effect that the book was outdated and cadets instead were being informed of the Condon Report's negative conclusion.\nControversy surrounded the report, both before and after its release. It has been observed that the report was \"harshly criticized by numerous scientists, particularly at the powerful AIAA\u00a0... [which] recommended moderate, but continuous scientific work on UFOs.\" In an address to the AAAS, James E. McDonald said he believed science had failed to mount adequate studies of the problem and criticized the Condon Report and earlier studies by the USAF as scientifically deficient. He also questioned the basis for Condon's conclusions and argued that the reports of UFOs have been \"laughed out of scientific court\". J. Allen Hynek, an astronomer who worked as a USAF consultant from 1948, sharply criticized the Condon Committee Report and later wrote two nontechnical books that set forth the case for continuing to investigate UFO reports.\nRuppelt recounted his experiences with Project Blue Book, a USAF investigation that preceded Condon's.\nFOIA release of documents in 1978.\nAccording to a 1979 New York Times report, \"records from the C.I.A., the F.B.I. and other Federal agencies\" (\"about 900 documents\u2014nearly 900 pages of memos, reports and correspondence\") obtained in 1978 through the Freedom of Information Act request, indicate that \"despite official pronouncements for decades that U.F.O.'s were nothing more than misidentified aerial objects and as such were no cause for alarm ... the phenomenon has aroused much serious behind\u2010the\u2010scenes concern\" in the US government. In particular, officials were concerned over the \"approximately 10%\" of UFO sightings which remained unexplained, and whether they might be Soviet aircraft and a threat to national security. Officials were concerned about the \"risk of false alerts\", of \"falsely identifying the real as phantom\", and of mass hysteria caused by sightings. In 1947, Brigadier General George F. Schulgen of Army Air Corps Intelligence, warned \"the first reported sightings might have been by individuals of Communist sympathies with the view to causing hysteria and fear of a secret Russian weapon.\"\nWhite House statement of November 2011.\nIn November 2011, the White House released an official response to two petitions asking the U.S. government to acknowledge formally that aliens have visited this planet and to disclose any intentional withholding of government interactions with extraterrestrial beings. According to the response:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The U.S. government has no evidence that any life exists outside our planet, or that an extraterrestrial presence has contacted or engaged any member of the human race...no credible information to suggest that any evidence is being hidden from the public's eye...\nThe response further noted that efforts, like SETI and NASA's \"Kepler\" space telescope and Mars Science Laboratory, continue looking for signs of life. The response noted \"odds are pretty high\" that there may be life on other planets but \"the odds of us making contact with any of them\u2014especially any intelligent ones\u2014are extremely small, given the distances involved.\"\nODNI report 2021.\nOn June 25, 2021, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a report on UAPs. The report found that the UAPTF was unable to identify 143 objects spotted between 2004 and 2021. The report said that 18 of these featured unusual movement patterns or flight characteristics, adding that more analysis was needed to determine if those sightings represented \"breakthrough\" technology. The report said that \"some of these steps are resource-intensive and would require additional investment.\" The report did not link the sightings to extraterrestrial life.\nUruguay (c. 1989).\nThe Uruguayan Air Force has conducted UFO investigations since 1989 and reportedly analyzed 2,100 cases of which they regard approximately 2% as lacking explanation.\nEurope.\nFinland (1967\u20131971).\nMany people reported UFO sightings in and around the Pudasj\u00e4rvi area in the North Ostrobothnia region in the late 1960s and early 1970s. UFO researchers and the press only became interested in UFOs in the area after a sighting in September 1969, after which UFO researchers from other parts of Finland and Sweden visited the area. An earthquake light has been proposed as an explanation for the Pudasj\u00e4rvi phenomena.\nFrance (1977\u20132008).\nIn March 2007, the French space agency CNES published an archive of UFO sightings and other phenomena online.\nFrench studies include GEPAN/SEPRA/GEIPAN within CNES (French space agency), the longest ongoing government-sponsored investigation. About 22% of the 6,000 cases studied remain unexplained. The official opinion of GEPAN/SEPRA/GEIPAN has been neutral, stating on their FAQ page that their mission is fact-finding for the scientific community, not rendering an opinion. They add they can neither prove nor disprove the Extraterrestrial Hypothesis (ETH), but their Steering Committee's clear position is that they cannot discard the possibility that some fraction of the very strange 22% of unexplained cases might be due to distant and advanced civilizations.\nPossibly their bias may be indicated by their use of the terms \"PAN\" (French) or \"UAP\" (English equivalent) for \"Unidentified \"Aerospace\" Phenomenon\" (whereas \"UAP\" is normally used by English organizations stands for \"Unidentified \"Aerial\" Phenomenon\", a more neutral term). In addition, the three heads of the studies have gone on record in stating that UFOs were real physical flying machines beyond our knowledge or that the best explanation for the most inexplicable cases was an extraterrestrial one. In 2007, the CNES's own report stated that, at that time, 28% of sightings remained unidentified.\nIn 2008, Michel Scheller, president of the Association A\u00e9ronautique et Astronautique de France (3AF), created the Sigma Commission. Its purpose was to investigate UFO phenomena worldwide. A progress report published in May 2010 stated that the central hypothesis proposed by the COMETA report is perfectly credible. In December 2012, the final report of the Sigma Commission was submitted to Scheller. Following the submission of the final report, the Sigma2 Commission is to be formed with a mandate to continue the scientific investigation of UFO phenomena.\nItaly (1933\u20132005).\nAlleged UFO sightings gradually increased since the war, peaking in 1978 and 2005. The total number of sightings since 1947 are 18,500, of which 90% are identifiable.\nUnited Kingdom (1951\u20132009).\nThe UK's Flying Saucer Working Party published its final report in June 1951, which remained secret for over fifty years. The Working Party concluded that all UFO sightings could be explained as misidentifications of ordinary objects or phenomena, optical illusions, psychological misperceptions/aberrations, or hoaxes. The report stated: \"We accordingly recommend very strongly that no further investigation of reported mysterious aerial phenomena be undertaken, unless and until some material evidence becomes available.\"\nEight file collections on UFO sightings, dating from 1978 to 1987, were first released on May 14, 2008, to The National Archives by the Ministry of Defence (MoD). Although kept secret from the public for many years, most of the files have low levels of classification and none are classified Top Secret. 200 files are set to be made public by 2012. The files are correspondence from the public sent to the British government and officials, such as the MoD and Margaret Thatcher. The MoD released the files under the Freedom of Information Act due to requests from researchers. These files include, but are not limited to, UFOs over Liverpool and Waterloo Bridge in London.\nOn October 20, 2008, more UFO files were released. One case released detailed that in 1991 an Alitalia passenger aircraft was approaching London Heathrow Airport when the pilots saw what they described as a \"cruise missile\" fly extremely close to the cockpit. The pilots believed a collision was imminent. UFO expert David Clarke says this is one of the most convincing cases for a UFO he has come across.\nA secret study of UFOs was undertaken for the Ministry of Defence between 1996 and 2000 and was code-named Project Condign. The resulting report, titled \"Unidentified Aerial Phenomena in the UK Defence Region\", was publicly released in 2006, but the identity and credentials of whoever constituted Project Condign remains classified. The report confirmed earlier findings that the main causes of UFO sightings are misidentification of man-made and natural objects. The report noted: \"No artefacts of unknown or unexplained origin have been reported or handed to the UK authorities, despite thousands of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena reports. There are no SIGINT, ELINT or radiation measurements and little useful video or still IMINT.\"\nIt concluded: \"There is no evidence that any UAP, seen in the UKADR [UK Air Defence Region], are incursions by air-objects of any intelligent (extraterrestrial or foreign) origin, or that they represent any hostile intent.\" A little-discussed conclusion of the report was that novel meteorological plasma phenomenon akin to ball lightning are responsible for \"the majority, if not all\" of otherwise inexplicable sightings, especially reports of black triangle UFOs.\nOn December 1, 2009, the Ministry of Defence quietly closed down its UFO investigations unit. The unit's hotline and email address were suspended by the MoD on that date. The MoD said there was no value in continuing to receive and investigate sightings in a release, stating that \"in over fifty years, no UFO report has revealed any evidence of a potential threat to the United Kingdom. The MoD has no specific capability for identifying the nature of such sightings. There is no Defence benefit in such investigation and it would be an inappropriate use of defence resources. Furthermore, responding to reported UFO sightings diverts MoD resources from tasks that are relevant to Defence.\" \"The Guardian\" reported that the MoD claimed the closure would save the Ministry around \u00a350,000 a year. The MoD said it would continue to release UFO files to the public through The National Archives.\nUFO reports, Parliamentary questions, and letters from members of the public were released on August 5, 2010, to the UK National Archives. \"In one letter included in the files, a man alleges Churchill ordered a coverup of a WW II-era UFO encounter involving the Royal Air Force\".\nReports of UFO sightings continue. According to \"The Independent,\" there were 957 reported UFO sightings across the UK between January 2021 and May 2023, with Manchester, London, Liverpool, and Glasgow being hotspots.\nStudies.\nCritics argue that all UFO evidence is anecdotal and can be explained as prosaic natural phenomena. Defenders of UFO research counter that knowledge of observational data, other than what is reported in the popular media, is limited in the scientific community and further study is needed. Studies have established that the majority of UFO observations are misidentified conventional objects or natural phenomena\u2014most commonly aircraft, balloons including sky lanterns, satellites, and astronomical objects such as meteors, bright stars and planets. A small percentage are hoaxes.\nFewer than 10% of reported sightings remain unexplained after proper investigation and therefore can be classified as unidentified in the strictest sense. According to Steven Novella, proponents of the extraterrestrial hypothesis (ETH) suggest these unexplained reports are of alien spacecraft, however the null hypothesis cannot be excluded; that these reports are simply other more prosaic phenomena that cannot be identified due to lack of complete information or due to the necessary subjectivity of the reports. Novella says that instead of accepting the null hypothesis, UFO enthusiasts tend to engage in special pleading by offering outlandish, untested explanations for the validity of the ETH, which violate Occam's razor.\nScientific.\nHistorically, ufology has not been considered credible in mainstream science. The scientific community has generally deemed that UFO sightings are not worthy of serious investigation except as a cultural artifact.&lt;ref name=\"Sturrock/Stanford\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nStudies of UFOs rarely appear in mainstream scientific literature. When asked, some scientists and scientific organizations have pointed to the end of official governmental studies in the U.S. in December 1969, following the statement by the government scientist Edward Condon that further study of UFOs could not be justified on grounds of scientific advancement.\nNevertheless, on 14 September 2023, NASA reported the appointment, for the first time, of a NASA Director of UAP Research (known earlier as U.F.O.), identified as Mark McInerney, to scientifically, and transparently, study such occurrences.\nStatus as a pseudoscience.\nJacques Vall\u00e9e, a scientist and ufologist, claimed there were deficiencies in most UFO research, including government studies. He criticized the mythology and cultism often associated with UFO sightings, but despite the challenges, Vall\u00e9e contended that several hundred professional scientists\u2014a group both he and Hynek termed \"the invisible college\"\u2014continued to study UFOs quietly on their own time.\nStudies.\nUFOs have become a prevalent theme in modern culture, and the social phenomena have been the subject of academic research in sociology and psychology.\nSturrock panel categorization.\nBesides anecdotal visual sightings, reports sometimes include claims of other kinds of evidence, including cases studied by the military and various government agencies of different countries (such as Project Blue Book, the Condon Committee, the French GEPAN/SEPRA, and Uruguay's current Air Force study).\nA comprehensive scientific review of cases where physical evidence was available was carried out by the 1998 Sturrock panel, with specific examples of many of the categories listed below.\nScientific skepticism.\nA scientifically skeptical group that has for many years offered critical analyses of UFO claims is the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI). One example is the response to local beliefs that \"extraterrestrial beings\" in UFOs were responsible for crop circles appearing in Indonesia, which the government and the National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN) described as \"man-made\". Thomas Djamaluddin, research professor of astronomy and astrophysics at LAPAN stated: \"We have come to agree that this 'thing' cannot be scientifically proven. Scientists have put UFOs in the category of pseudoscience.\"\nGovernmental.\nUFOs have been the subject of investigations by various governments that have provided extensive records related to the subject. Many of the most involved government-sponsored investigations ended after agencies concluded that there was no benefit to continued investigation. These same negative conclusions also have been found in studies that were highly classified for many years, such as the UK's Flying Saucer Working Party, Project Condign, the U.S. CIA-sponsored Robertson Panel, the U.S. military investigation into the green fireballs from 1948 to 1951, and the Battelle Memorial Institute study for the USAF from 1952 to 1955 (Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14).\nSome public government reports have acknowledged the possibility of the physical reality of UFOs, but have stopped short of proposing extraterrestrial origins, though not dismissing the possibility entirely. Examples are the Belgian military investigation into large triangles over their airspace in 1989\u20131991 and the 2009 Uruguayan Air Force study conclusion (see below).\nClaims by military, government, and aviation personnel.\nIn 2007, former Arizona governor Fife Symington claimed he had seen \"a massive, delta-shaped craft silently navigate over Squaw Peak, a mountain range in Phoenix, Arizona\" in 1997.\nApollo 14 astronaut Edgar Mitchell claimed he knew of senior government employees who had been involved in \"close encounters\", and because of this, he has no doubt that aliens have visited Earth.\nIn May 2019, \"The New York Times\" reported that American Navy fighter jets had several instances of unidentified instrumentation and tracking data while conducting exercises off the eastern seaboard of the United States from the summer of 2014 to March 2015. The \"Times\" published a cockpit instrument video that appeared to show an object moving at high speed near the ocean surface as it appeared to rotate, and objects that appeared capable of high acceleration, deceleration and maneuverability. In two separate incidents, a pilot reported his cockpit instruments locked onto and tracked objects but he was unable to see them through his helmet camera. In another encounter, flight instruments recorded an image described as a sphere encasing a cube between two jets as they flew about 100 feet apart. The Pentagon officially released these videos on April 27, 2020. The United States Navy has said there have been \"a number of reports of unauthorized and/or unidentified aircraft entering various military-controlled ranges and designated air space in recent years\".\nAccording to former U.S. Navy Lieutenant Ryan Graves, UAPs spotted by US Navy crew aboard the USS \"Nimitz\", the USS \"Princeton\", and other carriers in 2014 prompted flight safety concerns by some Navy pilots. Graves, described as \"one of the most vocal advocates for UAP transparency\", said the appearance of UFOs was frequent near aircraft carriers. In 2019, a US Navy spokesperson, Joseph Gradisher stated that \"For safety and security concerns, the Navy and the [US Air Force] takes these reports very seriously and investigates each and every report.\" and because of the sightings, the \"Navy is updating and formalising the process\" of reporting, with the reporting process updated by 2020 \nIn May 2021, military pilots recalled their related encounters, along with camera and radar support, including one pilot's account noting that such incidents occurred \"every day for at least a couple of years\", according to an interview broadcast on the news program, \"60 Minutes\" (May 16, 2021). Science writer and skeptic Mick West suggested the image was the result of an optical effect called a bokeh which can make out of focus light sources appear triangular or pyramidal due to the shape of the aperture of some lenses. In August, 2022, an article by West provided his detailed analysis of the video.\nOn June 25, 2021, U.S. Defense and intelligence officials released the nine pages Pentagon UFO Report (Preliminary Assessment: Unidentified Aerial Phenomena) on what they know about a series of unidentified flying objects that have been seen by American military pilots in the skies between 2004 and 2021. It observed that \"UAP probably lack a single explanation\", but identified airborne clutter and foreign adversary systems as among possible objects that \"clearly pose a safety of flight issue and may pose a challenge to U.S. national security\". The report also mentioned dangers associated with \"an increasingly cluttered air domain\" . The issue of safety with commercial airlines has also been raised. The report does not mentions extraterrestrials, but concludes that the objects found by the US military appear to be real in the majority of the 144 occurrences documented. \"Most of the UAP reported probably do represent physical objects given that a majority of UAP were registered across multiple sensors, to include radar, infrared, electro-optical, weapon seekers, and visual observation\", according to the report. The report also stated that \"UAP probably lack a single explanation\", and proposed five possible categories of explanation: airborne clutter, natural atmospheric phenomena, US government or industry development technology, foreign craft, and an \"Other\" category. Commenting on the document, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said that he did not think we are alone, but the UFO sightings by pilots \"may not be extraterrestrial.\"\nIn December 2021, further official governmental investigations into UAPs and related, along with annual unclassified reports presented to Congress, have been authorized and funded. Some have raised concerns about the new investigations.\nPresident of the United States Joe Biden in 2023 signed the Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Disclosure Act into law as part of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024 on December 14, 2023. The 64-page amendment defined and codified 22 technical definitions related to UFOs and non-human intelligence under the law.\nConspiracy theories.\nUFOs are sometimes an element of conspiracy theories in which governments are allegedly intentionally \"covering up\" the existence of aliens by removing physical evidence of their presence or even collaborating with extraterrestrial beings. There are many versions of this story; some are exclusive, while others overlap with various other conspiracy theories.\nIn the U.S., an opinion poll conducted in 1997 suggested that 80% of Americans believed the U.S. government was withholding such information. Various notables have also expressed such views. Some examples are astronauts Gordon Cooper and Edgar Mitchell, Senator Barry Goldwater, Vice Admiral Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter (the first CIA director), Lord Hill-Norton (former British Chief of Defense Staff and NATO head), the 1999 French COMETA study by various French generals and aerospace experts, and Yves Sillard (former director of CNES, new director of French UFO research organization GEIPAN).\nIn June 2023, United States Air Force officer and former intelligence official David Grusch claimed that the U.S. federal government has maintained a highly secretive UFO retrieval program since the 1940s and that the government possesses multiple spacecraft of \"non-human\" origin.\nIn May 2025, Matthew Brown, another former intelligence official, claimed elements of the US Government executive branch had conspired to prevent the US Congress from exercising its lawful powers of oversight with respect to UAP, Technology of Unknown Origin (TUO) and Non-Human Intelligence (NHI) issues. He also claimed there was a \"criminal conspiracy\" to keep the elected government of the United States ignorant of \"the profound discoveries and dire threats originating from the existence of UAP, NHI, and their technologies.\" He claimed there was an Unacknowledged Special Access Program (USAP) called \"Immaculate Constellation\" that consolidated observations of UAP etc. and used \"sophisticated internal information security controls\" to enforce the detection, quarantining and compartmentalisation of UAP imagery collection incidents before they were circulated within the various branches of national and military intelligence. This was how such sightings and observations could be denied to exist by intelligence officials when questioned on it because it had been hidden to them by systems of internal secrecy they were unaware about.\nA document written by an anonymous whistleblower (since revealed to have been authored by Matthew Brown in about 2018) was submitted to the Congressional Record at a public hearing of the House Oversight Committee in November 2024.\nIn a later interview with Jeremy Corbell and George Knapp, released online in May 2024, Brown claimed that a secret group of people had successfully \"reverse engineered\" TUO from downed UAP and the rest of humanity had been \"left behind\".\n\"Disclosure\" advocates.\nIn May 2001, a press conference was held at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., by an organization called the Disclosure Project, featuring twenty persons including retired Air Force and FAA personnel, intelligence officers and an air traffic controller. They all gave a brief account of their claims that evidence of UFOs was being suppressed and said they would be willing to testify under oath to a Congressional committee. According to a 2002 report in the Oregon \"Daily Emerald\", Disclosure Project founder Steven M. Greer is an \"alien theorist\" who claims \"proof of government coverup\" consisting of 120 hours of testimony from various government officials on the topic of UFOs, including astronaut Gordon Cooper.\nIn 2007, the German UFO conspiracy forum Disclose.tv was created. The website's name references the concept of disclosure.\nOn September 27, 2010, a group of six former USAF officers and one former enlisted Air Force man held a press conference at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., on the theme \"U.S. Nuclear Weapons Have Been Compromised by Unidentified Aerial Objects\" in which they claimed they had witnessed UFOs hovering near missile sites and even disarming the missiles.\nFrom April 29 to May 3, 2013, the Paradigm Research Group held the \"Citizen Hearing on Disclosure\" at the National Press Club. The group paid former U.S. Senator Mike Gravel and former Representatives Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick, Roscoe Bartlett, Merrill Cook, Darlene Hooley, and Lynn Woolsey $20,000 each to hear testimony from a panel of researchers which included witnesses from military, agency, and political backgrounds.\nReligious.\nUFOs have been interpreted by some groups in a religious way, often influenced by the Theosophical tradition. Some Christians have interpreted UFOs as demonic entities.\nUfology.\n\"Ufology\" is a neologism describing the study of UFO reports and associated evidence. Limited institutional or scientific study has given rise to independent researchers and UFO organizations, including the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) in the mid-20th century and, more recently, the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) and the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS).\nIn popular culture.\nUFOs have constituted a widespread international cultural phenomenon since the 1950s. Gallup Polls rank UFOs near the top of lists for subjects of widespread recognition. In 1973, a survey found that 95 percent of the public reported having heard of UFOs, whereas only 92 percent had heard of U.S. President Gerald Ford in a 1977 poll taken just nine months after he left the White House.\nA 1996 Gallup Poll reported that 71 percent of the United States population believed the U.S. government was covering up information regarding UFOs. A 2002 Roper Poll for the Sci-Fi Channel found similar results, but with more people believing UFOs are extraterrestrial craft. In that latest poll, 56 percent thought UFOs were real craft and 48 percent that aliens had visited the Earth. Again, about 70 percent felt the government was not sharing everything it knew about UFOs or extraterrestrial life.\nAnother effect of the flying saucer type of UFO sightings has been Earth-made flying saucer craft in space fiction, for example the United Planets Cruiser C57D in \"Forbidden Planet\" (1956), the \"Jupiter2\" in \"Lost in Space\", and the saucer section of the USS \"Enterprise\" in \"Star Trek\". UFOs and extraterrestrials have been featured in many movies.\nThe intense secrecy surrounding the secret Nevada base, known as Area 51, has made it the frequent subject of conspiracy theories and a central component of UFO folklore. In July 2019, more than 2 million people replied to a joke proposal to storm Area 51 which appeared in an anonymous Facebook post. Two music festivals in rural Nevada, \"AlienStock\" and \"Storm Area 51 Basecamp\", were subsequently organized to capitalize on the popularity of the original Facebook event. 150 people showed up to the Area 51 entrance and attendance at the festivals was 1,500.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\nGeneral.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31816", "revid": "50505954", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31816", "title": "Uganda", "text": "Country in East Africa\nUganda, officially the Republic of Uganda, is a landlocked country in East Africa. It is bordered to the east by Kenya, to the north by South Sudan, to the west by the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to the south-west by Rwanda, and to the south by Tanzania. The southern part includes a substantial portion of Lake Victoria, shared with Kenya and Tanzania. Uganda is in the African Great Lakes region, lies within the Nile basin, and has a varied equatorial climate. As of 2024[ [update]] it had a population of 49.3 million, of whom 8.5 million lived in the capital and largest city, Kampala.\nUganda is named after the Buganda kingdom, which encompasses a large portion of the south, including Kampala, and whose language Luganda is widely spoken; the official language is English. The region was populated by people of various ethnicities before Bantu and Nilotic groups arrived around 3,000 years ago. These new inhabitants established influential kingdoms such as the Empire of Kitara. The arrival of Arab traders in the 1830s and British explorers in the late 19th century marked the beginning of foreign influence. The British established the Protectorate of Uganda in 1894, setting the stage for future political dynamics. Uganda gained independence in 1962, with Milton Obote as the first prime minister. The 1966 Mengo Crisis marked a significant conflict with the Buganda kingdom, as well as the country's conversion from a parliamentary system to a presidential system. Idi Amin's military coup in 1971 led to a brutal regime characterised by mass killings and economic decline, until his overthrow in 1979.\nYoweri Museveni's National Resistance Movement (NRM) took power in 1986 after a six-year guerrilla war. While Museveni's rule resulted in stability and economic growth, political oppression and human rights abuses continued. The abolition of presidential term limits as well as allegations of electoral fraud and repression have raised concerns about Uganda's democratic future. Museveni was elected president in the 2011, 2016, and 2021 general elections. Human rights issues, corruption, and regional conflicts, such as involvement in the Congo Wars and the struggle against the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), continue to challenge Uganda. Despite this, it has made progress in education and health, improving literacy and reducing HIV infection, though challenges in maternal health and gender inequality persist.\nGeographically, Uganda is diverse, with volcanic hills, mountains, and lakes, including Lake Victoria, the world's second-largest freshwater lake. The country has significant natural resources, including fertile agricultural land and untapped oil reserves, contributing to its economic development. The service sector dominates the economy, surpassing agriculture. Uganda's rich biodiversity, with national parks and wildlife reserves, attracts tourism, a vital sector for the economy. Uganda is a member of the United Nations, the African Union, G77, the East African Community, and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.\nHistory.\nPrecolonial Uganda.\nMuch of Uganda was inhabited by Central Sudanic- and Kuliak-speaking farmers and herders until 3,000 years ago, when Bantu speakers arrived in the south and Nilotic speakers arrived in the northeast. By 1500 AD, they had all been assimilated into Bantu-speaking cultures south of Mount Elgon, the Nile River, and Lake Kyoga. According to oral tradition and archaeological studies, the Empire of Kitara covered an important part of the Great Lakes Area, from the northern lakes Albert and Kyoga to the southern lakes Victoria and Tanganyika. Kitara is claimed as the antecedent of the Tooro, Ankole, and Busoga kingdoms. Some Luo invaded Kitara and assimilated with the Bantu society there, establishing the Biito dynasty of the current Omukama (ruler) of Bunyoro-Kitara.\nArab traders moved into the land from the Indian Ocean coast of East Africa in the 1830s for trade and commerce. In the late 1860s, Bunyoro in Mid-Western Uganda found itself threatened from the north by Egyptian-sponsored agents. Unlike the Arab traders from the East African coast who sought trade, these agents were promoting foreign conquest. In 1869, Khedive Ismail Pasha of Egypt, seeking to annex the territories north of the borders of Lake Victoria and east of Lake Albert and \"south of Gondokoro\", sent a British explorer, Samuel Baker, on a military expedition to the frontiers of Northern Uganda, with the objective of suppressing the slave-trade there and opening the way to commerce and \"civilization\". The Banyoro resisted Baker, who had to fight a desperate battle to secure his retreat. Baker regarded the resistance as an act of treachery, and he denounced the Banyoro in a book (\"Ismailia \u2013 A Narrative Of The Expedition To Central Africa For The Suppression Of Slave Trade, Organised By Ismail, Khadive Of Egypt\" (1874)) that was widely read in Britain. Later, the British arrived in Uganda with a predisposition against the kingdom of Bunyoro and sided with the kingdom of Buganda. This eventually cost Bunyoro half of its territory, which was given to Buganda as a reward from the British. Two of the numerous \"lost counties\" were restored to Bunyoro after independence.\nIn the 1860s, while Arabs sought influence from the north, British explorers searching for the source of the Nile arrived in Uganda. They were followed by British Anglican missionaries who arrived in the kingdom of Buganda in 1877 and French Catholic missionaries in 1879. This situation gave rise to the death of the Uganda Martyrs in 1885\u2014after the conversion of Muteesa I and much of his court, and the succession of his anti-Christian son Mwanga. The British government chartered the Imperial British East Africa Company (IBEAC) to negotiate trade agreements in the region beginning in 1888.\nFrom 1886, there was a series of religious wars in Buganda, initially between Muslims and Christians and then, from 1890, between \"ba-Ingleza\" Protestants and \"ba-Fransa\" Catholics. These factions were named after the imperial powers with which they were aligned. Because of civil unrest and financial burdens, IBEAC claimed that it was unable to \"maintain their occupation\" in the region. British commercial interests were ardent to protect the trade route of the Nile, which prompted the British government to annex Buganda and adjoining territories to create the Uganda Protectorate in 1894.\nUganda Protectorate (1894\u20131962).\nThe Protectorate of Uganda was a protectorate of the British Empire from 1894 to 1962. In 1893, the Imperial British East Africa Company transferred its administration rights of territory consisting mainly of the Kingdom of Buganda to the British government. The IBEAC relinquished its control over Uganda after Ugandan internal religious wars had driven it into bankruptcy.\nIn 1894, the Uganda Protectorate was established, and the territory was extended beyond the borders of Buganda by signing more treaties with the other kingdoms (Toro in 1900, Ankole in 1901, and Bunyoro in 1933) to an area that roughly corresponds to that of present-day Uganda.\nThe status of protectorate meant that Uganda retained a degree of self-government that would have otherwise been limited under a full colonial administration, compared to neighbouring Kenya, which had been made a colony.\nIn the 1890s, 32,000 labourers from British India were recruited to East Africa under indentured labour contracts to construct the Uganda Railway. Most of the surviving Indians returned home, but 6,724 decided to remain in East Africa after the line's completion. Subsequently, some became traders and took control of cotton ginning and sartorial retail.\nFrom 1900 to 1920, a sleeping sickness epidemic in the southern part of Uganda, along the north shores of Lake Victoria, killed more than 250,000 people.\nWorld War II encouraged the colonial administration of Uganda to recruit 77,143 soldiers to serve in the King's African Rifles. They were seen in action in the Western Desert campaign, the Abyssinian campaign, the Battle of Madagascar and the Burma campaign.\nIndependence (1962\u20131965).\nUganda gained independence from the UK on 9 October 1962 with Queen Elizabeth II as head of state and Queen of Uganda. In October 1963, Uganda became a republic but maintained its membership in the Commonwealth of Nations.\nThe first post-independence election, held in 1962, was won by an alliance between the Uganda People's Congress (UPC) and Kabaka Yekka (KY). UPC and KY formed the first post-independence government with Milton Obote as executive prime minister, with the Buganda Kabaka (King) Edward Muteesa II holding the largely ceremonial position of president.\nBuganda crisis (1962\u20131966).\nUganda's immediate post-independence years were dominated by the relationship between the central government and the largest regional kingdom, Buganda.\nThe issue of how to manage the largest monarchy within the framework of a unitary state had been a problem since the British creation of the Protectorate of Uganda. Colonial governors had failed to come up with a formula that worked. This was further complicated by Buganda's nonchalant attitude to its relationship with the central government. Buganda never sought independence but rather appeared to be comfortable with a loose arrangement that guaranteed them privileges above the other subjects within the protectorate or a special status when the British left. This was evidenced in part by hostilities between the British colonial authorities and Buganda prior to independence.\nWithin Buganda, there were divisions between those who wanted the Kabaka to remain a dominant monarch and those who wanted to join with the rest of Uganda to create a modern secular state. The split resulted in the creation of two dominant Buganda based parties \u2013 the Kabaka Yekka (Kabaka Only) KY, and the Democratic Party (DP) that had roots in the Catholic Church. The bitterness between these two parties was extremely intense especially as the first elections for the post-Colonial parliament approached. The Kabaka particularly disliked the DP leader, Benedicto Kiwanuka.\nOutside Buganda, a soft-spoken politician from Northern Uganda, Milton Obote, had forged an alliance of non-Buganda politicians to form the Uganda People's Congress (UPC). The UPC at its heart was dominated by politicians who wanted to rectify what they saw as the regional inequality that favoured Buganda's special status. This drew in substantial support from outside Buganda. The party, however, remained a loose alliance of interests, but Obote showed great skill at negotiating them into a common ground based on a federal formula.\nAt Independence, the Buganda question remained unresolved. Uganda was one of the few colonial territories that achieved independence without a dominant political party with a clear majority in parliament. In the pre-Independence elections, the UPC ran no candidates in Buganda and won 37 of the 61 directly elected seats (outside Buganda). The DP won 24 seats outside Buganda. The \"special status\" granted to Buganda meant that the 21 Buganda seats were elected by proportional representation reflecting the elections to the Buganda parliament \u2013 the Lukikko. KY won a resounding victory over DP, winning all 21 seats.\nThe UPC reached a peak at the end of 1964 when the leader of the DP in parliament, Basil Kiiza Bataringaya, crossed the parliamentary floor with five other MPs, leaving DP with only nine seats. The DP MPs were not particularly happy that the hostility of their leader, Benedicto Kiwanuka, towards the Kabaka was hindering their chances of compromise with KY. The trickle of defections turned into a flood when 10 KY members crossed the floor when they realised the formal coalition with the UPC was no longer viable. Obote's charismatic speeches across the country were sweeping all before him, and the UPC was winning almost every local election held and increasing its control over all district councils and legislatures outside Buganda. The response from the Kabaka was mute \u2013 probably content in his ceremonial role and symbolism in his part of the country. However, there were also major divisions within his palace that made it difficult for him to act effectively against Obote. By the time Uganda had become independent, Buganda \"was a divided house with contending social and political forces\" There were however problems brewing inside the UPC. As its ranks swelled, the ethnic, religious, regional, and personal interests began to shake the party. The party's apparent strength was eroded in a complex sequence of factional conflicts in its central and regional structures. And by 1966, the UPC was tearing itself apart. The conflicts were further intensified by the newcomers who had crossed the parliamentary floor from DP and KY.\nThe UPC delegates arrived in Gulu in 1964 for their delegates conference. Here was the first demonstration as to how Obote was losing control of his party. The battle over the Secretary-General of the party was a bitter contest between the new moderate's candidate \u2013 Grace Ibingira and the radical John Kakonge. Ibingira subsequently became the symbol of the opposition to Obote within the UPC. This is an important factor when looking at the subsequent events that led to the crisis between Buganda and the Central government. For those outside the UPC (including KY supporters), this was a sign that Obote was vulnerable. Keen observers realised the UPC was not a cohesive unit.\nThe collapse of the UPC-KY alliance openly revealed the dissatisfaction Obote and others had about Buganda's \"special status\". In 1964, the government responded to demands from some parts of the vast Buganda Kingdom that they were not the Kabaka's subjects. Prior to colonial rule, Buganda had been rivalled by the neighbouring Bunyoro kingdom. Buganda had conquered parts of Bunyoro and the British colonialists had formalised this in the Buganda Agreements. Known as the \"lost counties\", the people in these areas wished to revert to being part of Bunyoro. Obote decided to allow a referendum, which angered the Kabaka and most of the rest of Buganda. The residents of the counties voted to return to Bunyoro despite the Kabaka's attempts to influence the vote. Having lost the referendum, KY opposed the bill to pass the counties to Bunyoro, thus ending the alliance with the UPC.\nThe UPC, which had previously been a national party, began to break along tribal lines when Ibingira challenged Obote in the UPC. The \"North/South\" ethnic divide that had been evident in economic and social spheres now entrenched itself in politics. Obote surrounded himself with mainly northern politicians, while Ibingira's supporters who were subsequently arrested and jailed with him, were mainly from the South. In time, the two factions acquired ethnic labels \u2013 \"Bantu\" (the mainly Southern Ibingira faction) and \"Nilotic\" (the mainly Northern Obote faction). The perception that the government was at war with the Bantu was further enhanced when Obote arrested and imprisoned the mainly Bantu ministers who backed Ibingira.\nThese labels brought into the mix two very powerful influences. First Buganda \u2013 the people of Buganda are Bantu and therefore naturally aligned to the Ibingira faction. The Ibingira faction further advanced this alliance by accusing Obote of wanting to overthrow the Kabaka. They were now aligned to opposing Obote. Second \u2013 the security forces \u2013 the British colonialists had recruited the army and police almost exclusively from Northern Uganda due to their perceived suitability for these roles. At independence, the army and police was dominated by northern tribes \u2013 mainly Nilotic. They would now feel more affiliated to Obote, and he took full advantage of this to consolidate his power. In April 1966, Obote passed out eight hundred new army recruits at Moroto, of whom seventy per cent came from the Northern Region.\nAt the time, there was a tendency to perceive central government and security forces as dominated by \"northerners,\" particularly the Acholi who through the UPC had significant access to government positions at the national level. In northern Uganda there were also varied degrees of anti-Buganda feelings, particularly over the kingdom's \"special status\" before and after independence, and all the economic and social benefits that came with this status. \"Obote brought significant numbers of northerners into the central state, both through the civil service and military, and created a patronage machine in Northern Uganda\". However, both \"Bantu\" and \"Nilotic\" labels represent significant ambiguities. The Bantu category for example includes both Buganda and Bunyoro \u2013 historically bitter rivals. The Nilotic label includes the Lugbara, Acholi, and Langi, all of whom have bitter rivalries that were to define Uganda's military politics later. Despite these ambiguities, these events unwittingly brought to fore the northerner/southerner political divide which to some extent still influences Ugandan politics.\nThe UPC fragmentation continued as opponents sensed Obote's vulnerability. At local level where the UPC dominated most councils discontent began to challenge incumbent council leaders. Even in Obote's home district, attempts were made to oust the head of the local district council in 1966. A more worrying fact for the UPC was that the next national elections loomed in 1967 \u2013 and without the support of KY (who were now likely to back the DP), and the growing factionalism in the UPC, there was the real possibility that the UPC would be out of power in months.\nObote went after KY with a new act of parliament in early 1966 that blocked any attempt by KY to expand outside Buganda. KY appeared to respond in parliament through one of their few remaining MPs, the terminally ill Daudi Ochieng. Ochieng was an irony \u2013 although from Northern Uganda, he had risen high in the ranks of KY and become a close confidant to the Kabaka who had gifted him with large land titles in Buganda. In Obote's absence from Parliament, Ochieng laid bare the illegal plundering of ivory and gold from the Congo that had been orchestrated by Obote's army chief of staff, Colonel Idi Amin. He further alleged that Obote, Onama and Neykon had all benefited from the scheme. Parliament overwhelmingly voted in favour of a motion to censure Amin and investigate Obote's involvement. This shook the government and raised tensions in the country.\nKY further demonstrated its ability to challenge Obote from within his party at the UPC Buganda conference, where the Attorney General, Godfrey Binaisa, was ousted by a faction believed to have the backing of KY, Ibingira and other anti-Obote elements in Buganda. Obote's response was to arrest Ibingira and other ministers at a cabinet meeting and to assume special powers in February 1966. In March 1966, Obote also announced that the offices of President and vice-president would cease to exist \u2013 effectively dismissing the Kabaka. Obote also gave Amin more power \u2013 giving him the Army Commander position over the previous holder (Opolot) who had relations to Buganda through marriage (possibly believing Opolot would be reluctant to take military action against the Kabaka if it came to that). Obote abolished the constitution and effectively suspended elections due in a few months. Obote went on television and radio to accuse the Kabaka of various offences including requesting foreign troops which appears to have been explored by the Kabaka following the rumours of Amin plotting a coup. Obote further dismantled the authority of the Kabaka by announcing among other measures:\nThis set the stage for a conflict between Buganda and the central government. Within Buganda's political institutions, rivalries driven by religion and personal ambition made the institutions ineffective and unable to respond to the central government moves. The Kabaka was often regarded as aloof and unresponsive to advice from the younger Buganda politicians who better understood the new post-Independence politics, unlike the traditionalists who were ambivalent to what was going on as long as their traditional benefits were maintained. The Kabaka favoured the neo-traditionalists.\nIn May 1966, the Kabaka asked for foreign help, and the Buganda parliament demanded that the Uganda government leave Buganda, including the capital, Kampala. In response Obote ordered Idi Amin to attack the Kabaka's palace. The battle for the Kabaka's palace was fierce \u2013 the Kabaka's guards putting up more resistance than had been expected. The British trained Captain \u2013 the Kabaka with about 120 armed men kept Idi Amin at bay for twelve hours. It is estimated that up to 2,000 people died in the battle which ended when the army called in heavier guns and overran the palace. The anticipated countryside uprising in Buganda did not materialise and a few hours later a beaming Obote met the press to relish his victory. The Kabaka escaped over the palace walls and was transported into exile in London by supporters. He died there three years later.\n1966\u20131971 (before the coup).\nIn 1966, following a power struggle between the Obote-led government and King Muteesa, Obote suspended the constitution and removed the ceremonial president and vice-president. In 1967, a new constitution proclaimed Uganda a republic and abolished the traditional kingdoms. Obote was declared the president.\nIdi Amin's regime (1971-1979).\nAfter a military coup on 25 January 1971, Obote was deposed from power and General Idi Amin seized control of the country. Amin ruled Uganda as dictator with the support of the military for the next eight years. He carried out mass killings within the country to maintain his rule. An estimated 80,000\u2013500,000 Ugandans died during his regime. Aside from his brutalities, he forcibly removed the entrepreneurial Indian minority from Uganda. In June 1976, Palestinian terrorists hijacked an Air France flight and forced it to land at Entebbe airport. One hundred of the 250 passengers originally on board were held hostage until an Israeli commando raid rescued them ten days later. Amin's reign was ended after the Uganda\u2013Tanzania War in 1979, in which Tanzanian forces aided by Ugandan exiles invaded Uganda.\n1979\u2013present.\nIn 1980, the Ugandan Bush War broke out, leading to Yoweri Museveni becoming president, as his forces toppled the previous regime in January 1986.\nPolitical parties in Uganda were restricted in their activities beginning that year, in a measure ostensibly designed to reduce sectarian violence. In the non-party \"Movement\" system instituted by Museveni, political parties continued to exist, but they could operate only a headquarters office. They could not open branches, hold rallies, or field candidates directly (although electoral candidates could belong to political parties). A constitutional referendum cancelled this nineteen-year ban on multi-party politics in July 2005.\nIn 1993, Pope John Paul II visited Uganda during his six-day pastoral trip to urge Ugandans to seek reconciliation.\nIn the mid-to-late 1990s, Museveni was lauded by Western countries as part of a new generation of African leaders. His presidency has been marred, however, by invading and occupying the Democratic Republic of the Congo during the Second Congo War, resulting in an estimated 5.4 million deaths since 1998, and by participating in other conflicts in the Great Lakes region of Africa. He has struggled for years in the civil war against the Lord's Resistance Army, which has been guilty of numerous crimes against humanity, including child slavery, the Atiak massacre, and other mass murders. Conflict in northern Uganda has killed thousands and displaced millions.\nParliament abolished presidential term limits in 2005, allegedly because Museveni used public funds to pay US$2,000 to each member of parliament who supported the measure. Presidential elections were held in February 2006. Museveni ran against several candidates, the most prominent of them being Kizza Besigye.\nOn 20 February 2011, the Uganda Electoral Commission declared Museveni the winning candidate of the 2011 elections that were held on 18 February 2011. The opposition however, were not satisfied with the results, condemning them as full of sham and rigging. According to the official results, Museveni won with 68 per cent of the votes. This easily topped his nearest challenger, Besigye, who had been Museveni's physician and told reporters that he and his supporters \"downrightly snub\" the outcome as well as the unremitting rule of Museveni or any person he may appoint. Besigye added that the rigged elections would definitely lead to an illegitimate leadership and that it is up to Ugandans to critically analyse this. The European Union's Election Observation Mission reported on improvements and flaws of the Ugandan electoral process: \"The electoral campaign and polling day were conducted in a peaceful manner. However, the electoral process was marred by avoidable administrative and logistical failures that led to an unacceptable number of Ugandan citizens being disfranchised.\"\nSince August 2012, hacktivist group Anonymous has threatened Ugandan officials and hacked official government websites over its anti-gay bills. Some international donors have threatened to cut financial aid to the country if anti-gay bills continue.\nIndicators of a plan for succession by the president's son, Muhoozi Kainerugaba, have increased tensions.\nMuseveni has ruled the country since 1986 and he was last re-elected in the January 2021 presidential elections. According to official results Museveni won the elections with 58% of the vote while popstar-turned-politician Bobi Wine had 35%. The opposition challenged the result because of allegations of widespread fraud and irregularities. Another opposition candidate was 24-year-old John Katumba.\nGeography.\nUganda is located in southeast Africa between 1\u00ba S and 4\u00ba N latitude, and between 30\u00ba E and 35\u00ba E longitude. Its geography is very diverse, consisting of volcanic hills, mountains, and lakes. The country sits at an average of 900 meters above sea level. Both the eastern and western borders of Uganda have mountains. The Ruwenzori mountain range contains the highest peak in Uganda, which is named Alexandra and measures .\nLakes and rivers.\nMuch of the south of the country is heavily influenced by one of the world's biggest lakes, Lake Victoria, which contains many islands. The most important cities are located in the south, near this lake, including the capital Kampala and the nearby city of Entebbe. Lake Kyoga is in the centre of the country and is surrounded by extensive marshy areas.\nAlthough landlocked, Uganda contains many large lakes. Besides Lakes Victoria and Kyoga, there are Lake Albert, Lake Edward, and the smaller Lake George. It lies almost completely within the Nile basin. The Victoria Nile drains from Lake Victoria into Lake Kyoga and thence into Lake Albert on the Congolese border. It then runs northwards into South Sudan. An area in eastern Uganda is drained by the Suam River, part of the internal drainage basin of Lake Turkana. The extreme north-eastern part of Uganda drains into the Lotikipi Basin, which is primarily in Kenya.\nBiodiversity and conservation.\nUganda has 60 protected areas, including ten national parks: Bwindi Impenetrable National Park and Rwenzori Mountains National Park (both UNESCO World Heritage Sites), Kibale National Park, Kidepo Valley National Park, Lake Mburo National Park, Mgahinga Gorilla National Park, Mount Elgon National Park, Murchison Falls National Park, Queen Elizabeth National Park, and Semuliki National Park.\nUganda is home to a vast number of species, including a population of mountain gorillas in the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, gorillas and golden monkeys in the Mgahinga Gorilla National Park, and hippos in the Murchison Falls National Park.\nJackfruit can also be found throughout the country.\nThe country had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 4.36/10, ranking it 128th globally out of 172 countries.\nGovernment and politics.\nThe President of Uganda is both head of state and head of government. The president appoints a vice-president and a prime minister to aid them in governing.\nThe Parliament of Uganda has 557 members. These include constituency representatives, district woman representatives and representatives of the Uganda People's Defense Forces. There are also 5 representatives of the youth, 5 representatives of workers, 5 representatives of persons with disabilities, and 18 ex officio members.\nFreedom of the press has been continually infringed upon through the use of intimidation and the Public Order Management Act (2013). Attacks on political freedom in the country, including the arrest and beating of opposition members of parliament, have led to international criticism, culminating in May 2005 in a decision by the British government to withhold part of its aid to the country. The arrest of the main opposition leader Kizza Besigye and the siege of the High Court during a hearing of Besigye's case by heavily armed security forces \u2013 before the February 2006 elections \u2013 led to condemnation.\nForeign relations.\nUganda is a member of the East African Community (EAC), along with Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, and South Sudan. According to the East African Common Market Protocol of 2010, the free trade and free movement of people is guaranteed, including the right to reside in another member country for purposes of employment. This protocol, however, has not been implemented because of work permit and other bureaucratic, legal, and financial obstacles. Uganda is a founding member of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), an eight-country bloc including governments from the Horn of Africa, Nile Valley, and the African Great Lakes. Its headquarters are in Djibouti City. Uganda is also a member of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.\nIn August 2025, Uganda made an agreement with the US to take in asylum seekers deported from the US.\nMigrants were to be of African origin and had to have no criminal record. Critics including Muwada Nkunyingi have likened this arrangement to human trafficking.\nMilitary.\nIn Uganda, the Uganda People's Defence Force serves as the military. The number of military personnel in Uganda is estimated at 45,000 soldiers on active duty. The Uganda army is involved in several peacekeeping and combat missions in the region, with commentators noting that only the United States Armed Forces is deployed in more countries. Uganda has soldiers deployed in the northern and eastern areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in the Central African Republic, Somalia, and South Sudan.\nCorruption.\nTransparency International has rated Uganda's public sector as one of the most corrupt in the world. In 2016, Uganda ranked 151st best out of 176 and had a score of 25 on a scale from 0 (perceived as most corrupt) to 100 (perceived as clean).\nThe World Bank's 2015 Worldwide Governance Indicators ranked Uganda in the worst 12 percentile of all countries. According to the United States Department of State's 2012 Human Rights Report on Uganda, \"The World Bank's most recent Worldwide Governance Indicators reflected corruption was a severe problem\" and that \"the country annually loses 768.9 billion shillings ($286 million) to corruption.\"\nUgandan parliamentarians in 2014 earned 60 times what was earned by most state employees, and they sought a major increase. This caused widespread criticism and protests, including the smuggling of two piglets into the parliament in June 2014 to highlight corruption amongst members of parliament. The protesters, who were arrested, used the word \"MPigs\" to highlight their grievance.\nA specific scandal, which had significant international consequences and highlighted the presence of corruption in high-level government offices, was the embezzlement of $12.6 million of donor funds from the Office of the Prime Minister in 2012. These funds were \"earmarked as crucial support for rebuilding northern Uganda, ravaged by a 20-year war, and Karamoja, Uganda's poorest region.\" This scandal prompted the EU, the United Kingdom, Germany, Denmark, Ireland, and Norway to suspend aid.\nWidespread grand and petty corruption involving public officials and political patronage systems have also seriously affected the investment climate in Uganda. One of the high corruption risk areas is the public procurement in which non-transparent under-the-table cash payments are often demanded from procurement officers.\nWhat may ultimately compound this problem is the availability of oil. The Petroleum Bill, passed by parliament in 2012 and touted by the NRM as bringing transparency to the oil sector, has failed to please domestic and international political commentators and economists. For instance, Angelo Izama, a Ugandan energy analyst at the US-based Open Society Foundation said the new law was tantamount to \"handing over an ATM (cash) machine\" to Museveni and his regime. According to Global Witness in 2012, a non-governmental organisation devoted to international law, Uganda now has \"oil reserves that have the potential to double the government's revenue within six to ten years, worth an estimated US $2.4 billion per year.\"\nThe Non-Governmental Organisations (Amendment) Act, passed in 2006, has stifled the productivity of NGOs through erecting barriers to entry, activity, funding and assembly within the sector. Burdensome and corrupt registration procedures (i.e. requiring recommendations from government officials; annual re-registration), unreasonable regulation of operations (i.e. requiring government notification prior to making contact with individuals in NGO's area of interest), and the precondition that all foreign funds be passed through the Bank of Uganda, among other things, are severely limiting the output of the NGO sector.\nA leaked confidential document exposes scandals in Uganda's Office of the Prime Minister, including distribution of rotten food, excessive spending, land grabbing allegations, and controversial handling of political matters. These revelations raise questions about the office's ethics and transparency and involves Charles Odongtho, the OPM's public relations expert.\nHuman rights.\nThere are many areas which continue to attract concern when it comes to human rights in Uganda.\nConflict in the northern parts of the country continues to generate reports of abuses by both the rebel Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), led by Joseph Kony, and the Ugandan Army. A UN official accused the LRA in February 2009 of \"appalling brutality\" in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nThe number of internally displaced persons is estimated at 1.4\u00a0million. Torture continues to be a widespread practice amongst security organisations.\nChild labour is common in Uganda. Many child workers are active in agriculture. Children who work on tobacco farms in Uganda are exposed to health hazards. Child domestic servants in Uganda risk sexual abuse. Trafficking of children occurs. Slavery and forced labour are prohibited by the Ugandan constitution.\nThe US Committee for Refugees and Immigrants reported several violations of refugee rights in 2007, including forcible deportations by the Ugandan government and violence directed against refugees.\nTorture and extrajudicial killings have been a pervasive problem in Uganda in recent years. For instance, according to a 2012 US State Department report, \"the African Center for Treatment and Rehabilitation for Torture Victims registered 170 allegations of torture against police, 214 against the UPDF, 1 against military police, 23 against the Special Investigations Unit, 361 against unspecified security personnel, and 24 against prison officials\" between January and September 2012.\nIn September 2009, Museveni refused Kabaka Muwenda Mutebi, the Baganda king, permission to visit some areas of Buganda Kingdom, particularly the Kayunga district. Riots occurred and over 40 people were killed while others still remain imprisoned. Furthermore, 9 more people were killed during the April 2011 \"Walk to Work\" demonstrations. According to the Humans Rights Watch 2013 World Report on Uganda, the government has failed to investigate the killings associated with both of these events.\nLGBT rights.\nIn 2007, a newspaper, the \"Red Pepper\", published a list of allegedly gay men; as a result, many of the men listed suffered harassment.\nOn 9 October 2010, the Ugandan newspaper \"Rolling Stone\" published a front-page article titled \"100 Pictures of Uganda's Top Homos Leak\" that listed the names, addresses, and photographs of 100 homosexuals alongside a yellow banner that read \"Hang Them.\" The paper also alleged homosexual recruitment of Ugandan children. The publication attracted international attention and criticism from human rights organisations, such as Amnesty International, No Peace Without Justice and the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association. According to gay rights activists, many Ugandans have been attacked since the publication. On 27 January 2011, gay rights activist David Kato was murdered.\nIn 2009, the Ugandan parliament considered an Anti-Homosexuality Bill which would have broadened the criminalisation of homosexuality by introducing the death penalty for people who have previous convictions, or are HIV-positive, and engage in same-sex sexual acts. The bill included provisions for Ugandans who engage in same-sex sexual relations outside of Uganda, asserting that they may be extradited back to Uganda for punishment, and included penalties for individuals, companies, media organisations, or non-governmental organisations that support legal protection for homosexuality or sodomy. On 14 October 2009, MP David Bahati submitted the private member's bill and was believed to have had widespread support in the Uganda parliament. The hacktivist group Anonymous hacked into Ugandan government websites in protest of the bill. In response to global condemnation the debate of the bill was delayed, but it was eventually passed on 20 December 2013 and President Museveni signed it on 24 February 2014. The death penalty was dropped in the final legislation. The law was widely condemned by the international community. Denmark, the Netherlands, and Sweden said they would withhold aid. On 28 February 2014, the World Bank said it would postpone a US$90 million loan, while the United States said it was reviewing ties with Uganda. On 1 August 2014, the Constitutional Court of Uganda ruled the bill invalid as it was not passed with the required quorum. A 13 August 2014 news report said that the Ugandan attorney general had dropped all plans to appeal, per a directive from President Museveni who was concerned about foreign reaction to the bill and who also said that any newly introduced bill should not criminalise same-sex relationships between consenting adults. As of 2019, adoption of LGBT rights on the African continent was slow but progressing with South Africa being the only country where same sex marriages are recognised.\nAnti-Homosexuality Act, 2023.\nOn 9 March 2023, Asuman Basalirwa (a member of parliament since 2018 from the opposition representing Bugiri Municipality on Justice Forum party ticket) tabled a proposed law which sought to castigate gay sex and \"the promotion or recognition of such relations\" and he made remarks that, \"In this country, or in this world, we talk about human rights. But it is also true that there are human wrongs. I want to submit that homosexuality is a human wrong that offends the laws of Uganda and threatens the sanctity of the family, the safety of our children and the continuation of humanity through reproduction.\"\u00a0The speaker of parliament, Annet Anita Among, referred the bill to a house committee for scrutiny, the first step in an accelerated process to pass the proposal into law. The parliament speaker had earlier noted that: \"We want to appreciate our promoters of homosexuality for the social economic development they have brought to the country,\" in reference to western countries and donors. \"But we do not appreciate the fact that they are killing morals. We do not need their money, we need our culture.\" - during a prayer service held in parliament and attended by several religious leaders. The Speaker vowed to pass the bill into law at whatever cost to shield Uganda's culture and its sovereignty.\nOn 21 March 2023, the Ugandan parliament approved a bill that would have made identifying as homosexual punishable by 20 year in prison and \"aggravated homosexuality\" by the death penalty. The bill was not approved by the President and, in the revised version which became law, identifying as homosexual was not a crime.\nThe United States strongly condemned the bill. During a White House Press briefing on 22 March 2023, Karine Jean-Pierre stated. \"Human rights are universal. No one should be attacked, imprisoned, or killed simply because of who they are or whom they love.\" Further criticism came from the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, and the European Union.\nRefugee policy.\nUganda\u2019s approach to hosting refugees is among the most progressive globally. Despite limited international support, the country maintains an open door policy that is anchored in national law. Refugees have access to essential services, may apply for work permits and move freely within the country. They are allotted a plot of land and may live in settlements that are closely integrated with surrounding Ugandan communities. They are also allowed to form associations and civil society groups. In this setting, many organisations created and run by refugees have developed, providing a range of support to their communities. These groups nonetheless face challenges such as scarce funding, barriers to registration and limited influence over decisions. The refugee policy does not provide a path to Ugandan citizenship.\nUganda has a long history of receiving displaced people. The country hosted refugees even before its independence in 1962, including groups fleeing World War II and later people escaping violence in Rwanda and southern Sudan. Uganda also experienced periods when large numbers of its own citizens were displaced, particularly during the 1970s and 1980s and during the insurgency by the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army. Regional conflicts throughout the 1990s and 2000s, including the Rwandan genocide, Sudanese civil war and the Congolese wars, continued to drive people into Uganda. By 2014, the country sheltered roughly 400,000 displaced people.\nBy October 2025, Uganda hosted roughly 1.95 million refugees, more than any other country in Africa. Most are rural groups mainly from South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as from Somalia, Burundi, and Rwanda. From 2023, more than 90,000 refugees fleeing the civil war in Sudan have entered.\nAdministrative divisions.\nAs of 2022[ [update]], Uganda is divided into four Regions of Uganda and 136 districts. Rural areas of districts are subdivided into sub-counties, parishes, and villages. Municipal and town councils are designated in urban areas of districts.\nPolitical subdivisions in Uganda are officially served and united by the Uganda Local Governments Association (ULGA), a voluntary and non-profit body which also serves as a forum for support and guidance for Ugandan sub-national governments.\nParallel with the state administration, five traditional Bantu kingdoms have remained, enjoying some degrees of mainly cultural autonomy. The kingdoms are Toro, Busoga, Bunyoro, Buganda, and Rwenzururu. Furthermore, some groups attempt to restore Ankole as one of the officially recognised traditional kingdoms, to no avail yet. Several other kingdoms and chiefdoms are officially recognised by the government, including the union of Alur chiefdoms, the Iteso paramount chieftaincy, the paramount chieftaincy of Lango and the Padhola state.\nEconomy and infrastructure.\nThe Bank of Uganda is the central bank of Uganda and handles monetary policy along with the printing of the Ugandan shilling.\nIn 2015, Uganda's economy generated export income from the following merchandise: coffee (US$402.63 million), oil re-exports (US$131.25 million), base metals and products (US$120.00 million), fish (US$117.56 million), maize (US$90.97 million), cement (US$80.13 million), tobacco (US$73.13 million), tea (US$69.94 million), sugar (US$66.43 million), hides and skins (US$62.71 million), cocoa beans (US$55.67 million), beans (US$53.88 million), simsim (US$52.20 million), flowers (US$51.44 million), and other products (US$766.77 million).\nThe country has been experiencing consistent economic growth. In fiscal year 2015\u201316, Uganda recorded gross domestic product growth of 4.6 per cent in real terms and 11.6 per cent in nominal terms. This compares to 5.0 per cent real growth in fiscal year 2014\u201315.\nThe country has largely untapped reserves of both crude oil and natural gas. While agriculture accounted for 56 per cent of the economy in 1986, with coffee as its main export, it has now been surpassed by the services sector, which accounted for 52 per cent of GDP in 2007. In the 1950s, the British colonial regime encouraged some 500,000 subsistence farmers to join co-operatives. Since 1986, the government (with the support of foreign countries and international agencies) has acted to rehabilitate an economy devastated during the regime of Idi Amin and the subsequent civil war.\nIn 2012, the World Bank listed Uganda on the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries list.\nEconomic growth has not always led to poverty reduction. Despite an average annual growth of 2.5 per cent between 2000 and 2003, poverty levels increased by 3.8 per cent during that time. This has highlighted the importance of avoiding jobless growth and is part of the rising awareness in development circles of the need for equitable growth not just in Uganda, but across the developing world.\nWith the Uganda securities exchanges established in 1996, several equities have been listed. The government has used the stock market as an avenue for privatisation. All government treasury issues are listed on the securities exchange. The Capital Markets Authority has licensed 18 brokers, asset managers, and investment advisors including: African Alliance Investment Bank, Baroda Capital Markets Uganda Limited, Crane Financial Services Uganda Limited, Crested Stocks and Securities Limited, Dyer &amp; Blair Investment Bank, Equity Stock Brokers Uganda Limited, Renaissance Capital Investment Bank and UAP Financial Services Limited. As one of the ways of increasing formal domestic savings, pension sector reform is the centre of attention (2007).\nUganda traditionally depends on Kenya for access to the Indian Ocean port of Mombasa. Efforts have intensified to establish a second access route to the sea via the lakeside ports of Bukasa in Uganda and Musoma in Tanzania, connected by railway to Arusha in the Tanzanian interior and to the port of Tanga on the Indian Ocean.\nUganda is a member of the East African Community and a potential member of the planned East African Federation.\nUganda has a large diaspora, residing mainly in the United States and the United Kingdom. This diaspora has contributed enormously to Uganda's economic growth through remittances and other investments (especially property). According to the World Bank, Uganda received in 2016 an estimated US$1.099 billion in remittances from abroad, second only to Kenya (US$1.574 billion) in the East African Community, and seventh in Africa. Uganda also serves as an economic hub for a number of neighbouring countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan, and Rwanda.\nThe Ugandan Bureau of Statistics announced inflation was 4.6 per cent in November 2016. On 29 June 2018, Uganda's statistics agency said the country registered a drop in inflation to 3.4 per cent in the financial year ending 2017/18 compared to the 5.7 per cent recorded in the financial year 2016/17.\nIndustry.\nUganda ranked as number 102 among the countries of the world in nominal Gross Domestic Product by the International Monetary Fund with a GDP of 26,349 (US$million). The World Bank ranked Uganda as number 99 in nominal GDP with a GDP of 25,891 (US$million).\nBased on the GDP with purchasing power parity the IMF ranked Uganda as number 86 (91,212 million of current Int$) and the World Bank ranked them 90 (79,889 million of current Int$).\nSince the 1990s, the economy in Uganda has grown. Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an average of 6.7% annually during the period 1990\u20132015, whereas real GDP per capita grew at 3.3% per annum during the same period.\nPoverty.\nUganda is one of the poorest nations in the world. In 2012, 37.8 per cent of the population lived on less than $1.25 a day. Despite making enormous progress in reducing the countrywide poverty incidence from 56 per cent of the population in 1992 to 24.5 per cent in 2009, poverty remains deep-rooted in the country's rural areas, which are home to 84 per cent of Ugandans.\nPeople in rural areas of Uganda depend on farming as the main source of income and 90 per cent of all rural women work in the agricultural sector. In addition to agricultural work, rural women are responsible for the caretaking of their families. The average Ugandan woman spends 9 hours a day on domestic tasks, such as preparing food and clothing, fetching water and firewood, and caring for the elderly, the sick as well as orphans. Women on average work longer hours than men, between 12 and 18 hours per day, with a mean of 15 hours, as compared to men, who work between 8 and 10 hours a day, although urban men and women work very similar hours. 26% of households in 2005 were headed by women only (FHH), up from previous years as a result of death of men from AIDS. There were most FHHs in the top quintile, by income, (31%). Male only headed households in poverty were also increased to a similar level as FHH, though little research had been done.\nTo supplement their income, rural women may engage in small-scale entrepreneurial activities such as rearing and selling local breeds of animals. Nonetheless, because of their heavy workload, they have little time for these income-generating activities. The poor cannot support their children at school and in most cases, girls drop out of school to help out in domestic work or to get married. Other girls engage in sex work. As a result, young women tend to have older and more sexually experienced partners and this puts women at a disproportionate risk of getting affected by HIV, accounting for about 5.7 per cent of all adults living with HIV in Uganda.\nMaternal health in rural Uganda lags behind national policy targets and the Millennium Development Goals, with geographical inaccessibility, lack of transport and financial burdens identified as key demand-side constraints to accessing maternal health services; as such, interventions like intermediate transport mechanisms have been adopted as a means to improve women's access to maternal health care services in rural regions of the country.\nGender inequality is the main hindrance to reducing women's poverty. Women are subjected to an overall lower social status than men. Many women believe this reduces their power to act independently, participate in community life, become educated and escape reliance upon abusive men.\nAir transportation.\nThere are 36 airports in Uganda. Commercial airlines operate scheduled passenger services out of four airports. Uganda currently has one functioning international airport, Entebbe International Airport, which is located south-west of Kampala. In 2017, the airport traffic was 1.53 million passengers, 8% more than the previous year. A second international airport, Hoima International Airport, is currently under construction.\nRoad network.\nRoads are the main method of transportation in Uganda. 95% of freight and passenger traffic is handled by road traffic. The road network in Uganda is approximately long. About 4% of these roads are paved which equates to only about of paved road. The different types of roads are national roads (\u201417%), district roads (\u201426%), urban roads (\u20147%), and community roads (\u201450%). The national roads make up about 17% of the road network but carry over 80% of the total road traffic. In Uganda there are 83,000 private cars which means 2.94 cars per 1000 inhabitants.\nRailroad.\nThe rail network in Uganda is approximately long. The longest lines are the main line from Kampala to Tororo (), the western line from Kampala to Kasese (), the northern line from Tororo to Pakwach ().\nCommunications.\nThere are several systems of communication, including telephony, radio and television broadcasts, internet, mail, and newspapers. The use of phones and the internet has rapidly increased.\nThere are seven telecommunications companies and, as of 2018[ [update]], over 24 million subscribers according to the Uganda Communications Commission, in a population of 48 million. More than 95% of internet connections are made using mobile phones.\nEnergy.\nUganda has abundant energy resources, which are fairly distributed throughout the country. These include hydropower, biomass, solar, geothermal, peat and fossil fuels.\nIn the 1980s, the majority of energy in Uganda came from charcoal and wood. However, oil was found in the Lake Albert area, totalling an estimated of crude. Heritage Oil discovered one of the largest crude oil finds in Uganda, and continues operations there.\nUganda and Tanzania signed a deal on 13 September\u00a02016 for the two countries build a 1,445\u00a0km, $3.5bn crude oil pipeline. The Uganda\u2013Tanzania Crude Oil Pipeline (UTCOP), also known as the East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP), will be the first of its kind in East Africa, will connect Uganda's oil-rich Hoima region with the Indian Ocean through the Tanga port in Tanzania.\nUganda's favourable enabling environment and broad presence of private sector investment presents a unique opportunity to deliver on Power Africa goals. Uganda is one of the few sub-Saharan African countries to have liberalised and financially viable energy markets, with generation, transmission and supply segments unbundled since 2001. There is an independent Electricity Regulatory Authority that undertakes sector regulation and oversight. The largest distribution company, UMEME is privately owned and has a 20-year concession for distribution and retail. The country, however, is divided into 13 rural service territories, and 6 of these are being managed by small distribution companies. Independent power producers (IPPs) currently account for nearly 60% of generation capacity. Issues with integrated planning and the financial ecosystem persist.\nWater supply and sanitation.\nAccording to a 2006 published report, the Ugandan water supply and sanitation sector had made substantial progress in urban areas since the mid-1990s, with substantial increases in coverage as well as in operational and commercial performance. Sector reforms in the period 1998\u20132003 included the commercialisation and modernisation of the National Water and Sewerage Corporation operating in cities and larger towns, as well as decentralisation and private sector participation in small towns.\nAlthough these reforms have attracted significant international attention, 38 per cent of the population still had no access to an improved water source in 2010. Concerning access to improved sanitation, figures have varied widely. According to government figures, it was 70 per cent in rural areas and 81 per cent in urban areas in 2011; according to UN figures, it was only 34 per cent.\nThe water and sanitation sector was recognised as a key area under the 2004 Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP), Uganda's\nmain strategy paper to fight poverty. According to a 2006 published report, a comprehensive expenditure framework had been introduced to co-ordinate financial support by external donors, the national government, and nongovernmental organisations. The PEAP estimated that from 2001 to 2015, about US$1.4 billion, or US$92 million per year, was needed to increase water supply coverage up to 95 per cent, with rural areas needing US$956 million, urban areas and large towns needing US$281 million, and small towns needing US$136 million.\nEducation.\nUganda's educational system, while lacking in many areas, has seen significant change since the late 1990s. The educational system is set up so that children spend seven years in primary school, six years in secondary school, and three to five years in post secondary school. In 1997, the government declared that primary school would be free for all children. This amendment has had huge benefits. In 1986, only two million children were attending primary school. By 1999, six million children were attending primary school, and this number has continued to climb.\nFollowing significant gains in access to primary education since 1997 when universal primary education (UPE) was introduced, Uganda in 2007 became the first country in sub-Saharan Africa to introduce universal secondary education (USE). This led to an increase in lower secondary enrolment of nearly 25% between 2007 and 2012.\nAt the 2002 census, Uganda had a literacy rate of 66.8 per cent (76.8 per cent male and 57.7 per cent female). Public spending on education was at 5.2 per cent of the 2002\u20132005 GDP.\nAs of 2020[ [update]], the NCHE website listed 46 private accredited universities, including Makerere University, Mbarara University of science and technology, Kyambogo University, Gulu University, Uganda Christian University, Kampala international University.\nHealth.\nThere were eight physicians per 100,000 persons in the early 2000s. Uganda's elimination of user fees at state health facilities in 2001 has resulted in an 80 per cent increase in visits, with over half of this increase coming from the poorest 20 per cent of the population. This policy has been cited as a key factor in helping Uganda achieve its Millennium Development Goals and as an example of the importance of equity in achieving those goals. Despite this policy, many users are denied care if they do not provide their own medical equipment, as happened in the highly publicised case of Jennifer Anguko. Poor communication within hospitals, low satisfaction with health services and distance to health service providers undermine the provision of quality health care to people living in Uganda, and particularly for those in poor and elderly-headed households. The provision of subsidies for poor and rural populations, along with the extension of public private partnerships, have been identified as important provisions to enable vulnerable populations to access health services.\nLife expectancy at birth was estimated to be 63.4 years in 2019. The infant mortality rate was approximately 61 deaths per 1,000 children in 2012.\nIn July 2012, there was an Ebola outbreak in the Kibaale District of the country. On 4 October 2012, the Ministry of Health officially declared the end of the outbreak after at least 16 people had died.\nThe Health Ministry announced on 16 August 2013 that three people had died in northern Uganda from a suspected outbreak of Congo Crimean Hemorrhagic Fever.\nUganda has been among the rare HIV success stories. Infection rates of 30 per cent of the population in the 1980s fell to 6.4 per cent by the end of 2008. Meanwhile, the practice of abstinence was found to have decreased.\nLess than half of all sexually active unmarried women use a modern contraceptive method, a fraction that has barely changed from 2000 to 2011. However, only \u224826% of married women used contraceptives in 2011. The use of contraceptives also differs substantially between poor (\u224815%) and wealthy women (\u224840%). As a result, Ugandan women have \u22486 children while they prefer to have around \u22484. According to the 2011 Uganda Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), more than 40% of births are unplanned. In 2010, the Ugandan Ministry of Health estimated that unsafe abortion accounted for 8% of the country's maternal deaths. The 2006 Uganda Demographic Health Survey (UDHS) indicated that roughly 6,000 women die each year from pregnancy-related complications. Pilot studies in 2012 by Future Health Systems have shown that this rate could be significantly reduced by implementing a voucher scheme for health services and transport to clinics.\nThe prevalence of female genital mutilation (FGM) is low: according to a 2013 UNICEF report, only 1 per cent of women in Uganda have undergone FGM, with the practice being illegal in the country.\nCrime and law enforcement.\nThe Uganda Police Force is the national police force. Its head is called the Inspector General of Police (IGP), currently Abbas Byakagaba. Byakagaba replaced former IGP, Geoffrey Tumusiime on 18 May 2024. Recruitment to the forces is done annually.\nThe Allied Democratic Forces is a violent rebel force that opposes the Ugandan government. These rebels are an enemy of the Uganda People's Defence Force and an affiliate of Al-Shabaab.\nTourism.\nTourism in Uganda is focused on Uganda's landscape and wildlife. It is a major driver of employment, investment and foreign exchange, contributing 4.9 trillion Ugandan shillings (US$1.88 billion or \u20ac1.4 billion as of August 2013) to Uganda's GDP in the financial year 2012\u201313. The Uganda Tourism Board is responsible for maintaining information pertaining to tourism in Uganda. The main attractions are photo safaris through the National parks and game Reserves. Other attractions include the Mountain Gorillas found in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park (BINP) and Mgahinga Gorilla National Park (MGNP), Uganda having some of the oldest cultural kingdom in Africa has many Cultural sites. Uganda is a birding paradise boasting a massive bird list of more than 1073 recorded bird species ranking 4th in Africa's bird species and 16th internationally. Uganda has landscapes ranging from white-capped Rwenzori mountains to the Great Rift Valley.\nScience and technology.\nThe \"National Science, Technology and Innovation Policy\" dates from 2009. Its overarching goal is to 'strengthen national capability to generate, transfer and apply scientific knowledge, skills and technologies that ensure sustainable utilisation of natural resources for the realisation of Uganda's development objectives.' The policy precedes Uganda Vision 2040, which was launched in April 2013 to transform 'Ugandan society from a peasant to a modern and prosperous country within 30 years,' in the words of the Cabinet. Uganda Vision 2040 vows to strengthen the private sector, improve education and training, modernise infrastructure and the underdeveloped services and agriculture sectors, foster industrialisation and promote good governance, among other goals. Potential areas for economic development include oil and gas, tourism, minerals and information and communication technologies (ICTs).\nUganda was ranked 124th in the Global Innovation Index in 2025, down from 102nd in 2019. Research funding climbed between 2008 and 2010 from 0.33% to 0.48% of GDP. Over the same period, the number of researchers doubled (in head counts) from 1 387 to 2 823, according to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics. This represents a leap from 44 to 83 researchers per million inhabitants over the same period. One in four researchers is a woman.\nDemographics.\nUganda's population grew from 9.5 million people in 1969 to 34.9 million in 2014, and was estimated at 49.3 million. With respect to the last inter-censal period (September 2002), the population increased by 10.6 million people in the past 12 years. Uganda's median age of 15 years is the lowest in the world. Uganda has the fifth highest total fertility rate in the world, at 5.97 children born per woman (2014 estimates).\nAccording to the 2024 Census, the country had a total population of 45.9 million people. Of this population, 23.6 million (51.4 per cent) were female and 22.3 million were male. The census results also showed that 49.5 per cent of Ugandans were under the age of 18, underscoring the country\u2019s very young age structure.\nThere were about 80,000 Indians in Uganda before Idi Amin required the expulsion of Ugandan-Asians (mostly of Indian origin) in 1972, which reduced the population to as low as 7,000. Many Indians, however, returned to Uganda after Amin's ouster in 1979. Around 90 per cent of Ugandan Indians reside in Kampala. There is also a population of about 10,000 white Africans and 3,000 Arabs in the country.\nAccording to the UNHCR, Uganda hosts over 1.4 million refugees on its soil as of August 2021. Most come from neighbouring countries in the African Great Lakes region, particularly South Sudan (68.0 per cent) and Democratic Republic of the Congo (24.6%). In August 2021, Uganda received some refugees from Afghanistan following the Taliban takeover.\nLanguages.\nSwahili, a widely used language throughout the African Great Lakes region, was approved as the country's second official national language in 2005. English was the only official language until the constitution was amended in 2005. Uganda has its own dialect of English, known as Uglish. Although Swahili has not been favoured by the Bantu-speaking populations of the south and south-west of the country, it is an important \"lingua franca\" in the northern regions. It is also widely used in the police and military forces, which may be a historical result of the disproportionate recruitment of northerners into the security forces during the colonial period. The status of Swahili has thus alternated with the political group in power. For example, Idi Amin, who came from the north-west, declared Swahili to be the national language.\nReligion.\nThe Catholic Church had the largest number of adherents (39.3 per cent, down from 41.6 in 2002), followed by the Anglican Church of Uganda (32 per cent, down from 35.9 per cent). The category of Evangelical/Pentecostal/Born-Again showed the most growth, rising from 4.7% in 2002 to 11.1% in 2018. Adventist and other Protestant churches claimed most of the remaining Christians, although there was also a small Eastern Orthodox community. The next most reported religion of Uganda was Islam, with Muslims representing 14% per cent of the population, up from 12.1% in 2002.\nThe remainder of the population according to the 2014 census followed traditional religions (0.1 per cent, down from 1% in 2002), other religions (1.4 per cent), or had no religious affiliation (0.2 per cent).\nCulture.\nOwing to the large number of communities, culture within Uganda is diverse. Many Asians (mostly from India) who were expelled during the regime of Idi Amin have returned to Uganda.\nMedia.\nUganda has a number of media outlets that broadcast domestically and globally. They cover news, magazines, sports, business and entertainment.\nPopular Ugandan newspapers include:\nThe most popular television stations in Uganda include:\nAll of the media is controlled and regulated under the Uganda Communications Commission (UCC).\nSports.\nFootball is the national sport in Uganda. The Uganda national football team, nicknamed \"The Cranes\", is controlled by the Federation of Uganda Football Associations. They have never qualified for the FIFA World Cup finals. Their best finish in the African Cup of Nations was second in 1978. Among clubs, SC Villa are the most successful, having won the national league 16 times and having reached the final of the African Cup of Champions Clubs in 1991, a feat also achieved by Simba SC in 1972. KCCA are second in national league wins with 13.\nAs of 2020[ [update]], Uganda at the Olympics has won a total of two gold, three silver, and two bronze medals, four of which were in boxing and three in athletics. At the Commonwealth Games, Uganda has collected 13 gold medals and a total 49 medals, all in boxing and athletics.\nThe Uganda national boxing team is called The Bombers. They have won four medals at the Summer Olympics from 1968 to 1980, as well as two medals the 1974 World Amateur Boxing Championships. Notable boxers include Cornelius Boza-Edwards, Justin Juuko, Ayub Kalule, John Mugabi, Eridadi Mukwanga, Joseph Nsubuga, Kassim Ouma, Sam Rukundo and Leo Rwabwogo.\nIn athletics, John Akii-Bua won the first Olympic gold medal for Uganda. At the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, he won the 400m hurdles race with a world record time of 47.82 seconds. 400 metres runner Davis Kamoga earned the bronze medal at 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta and the silver medal at the 1997 World Championships. Dorcus Inzikuru won the 3000 m steeplechase at the 2005 World Championships and the 2006 Commonwealth Games.\nStephen Kiprotich has won the marathon at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London and the 2013 World Championships, and finished second at the 2015 Tokyo Marathon. Joshua Cheptegei has won 10\u00a0km races at the World Championships, World Athletics Cross Country Championships and Commonwealth Games, and has set world records in 5\u00a0km and 15\u00a0km. Halimah Nakaayi won the 800 meters race at the 2019 World Championships.\nIn cricket, Uganda was part of the East Africa team that qualified for the Cricket World Cup in 1975. Recently Uganda national cricket team qualified for 2024 ICC T20 World Cup.\nThe country has an increasingly successful national basketball team. It is nicknamed \"The Silverbacks\", and made its debut at the 2015 FIBA Africa Championship.\nIn July 2011, Kampala, Uganda qualified for the 2011 Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pennsylvania for the first time, beating Saudi Arabian baseball team Dharan LL, although visa complications prevented them from attending the series. Little League teams from Uganda qualified for and attended the 2012 Little League World Series.\nCinema.\nThe Ugandan film industry is relatively young. It is developing quickly, but still faces an assortment of challenges. There has been support for the industry as seen in the proliferation of film festivals such as Amakula, Pearl International Film Festival, Maisha African Film Festival and Manya Human Rights Festival. However, filmmakers struggle against the competing markets from other countries on the continent such as those in Nigeria and South Africa in addition to the big budget films from Hollywood.\nThe first publicly recognised film that was produced solely by Ugandans was \"Feelings Struggle\", which was directed and written by Hajji Ashraf Ssemwogerere in 2005. This marks the year of ascent of film in Uganda, a time when many enthusiasts were proud to classify themselves as cinematographers in varied capacities.\nThe local film industry is polarised between two types of filmmakers. The first are filmmakers who use the Nollywood video film era's guerrilla approach to film making, churning out a picture in around two weeks and screening it in makeshift video halls. The second is the filmmaker who has the film aesthetic, but with limited funds has to depend on the competitive scramble for donor cash.\nThough cinema in Uganda is evolving, it still faces major challenges. Along with technical problems such as refining acting and editing skills, there are issues regarding funding and lack of government support and investment. There are no schools in the country dedicated to film, banks do not extend credit to film ventures, and distribution and marketing of movies remains poor.\nThe Uganda Communications Commission (UCC) prepared regulations starting in 2014 that required Ugandan television to broadcast 70 per cent Ugandan content and of this, 40 per cent to be independent productions. With the emphasis on Ugandan film and the UCC regulations favouring Ugandan productions for mainstream television, Ugandan film may become more prominent and successful in the near future.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its various regions have diverse geographic features ranging from highlands to lowlands, as well as climatic range and a wide variety in hydrography. Most of the country lies within the East European Plain.\nLying between latitudes 44\u00b0 and 53\u00b0 N, and longitudes 22\u00b0 and 41\u00b0 E, Ukraine covers an area of , with a coastline of .\nThe landscape of Ukraine consists mostly of fertile steppes and plateaus, crossed by rivers such as the Dnieper, Siverskyi Donets, Dniester and the Southern Bug as they flow south into the Black Sea and the smaller Sea of Azov. To the southwest, the delta of the Danube forms the border with Romania. The country's only mountains are the Carpathian Mountains in the west, of which the highest is Hoverla at , and the Crimean Mountains, in the extreme south along the coast.\nUkraine also has a number of highland regions such as the Volyn-Podillia Upland (in the west) and the Dnieper Upland (on the right bank of the Dnieper). To the east there are the south-western spurs of the Central Russian Upland, over which runs the border with the Russia. Near the Sea of Azov can be found the Donets Ridge and the Azov Upland. The snow melt from the mountains feeds the rivers and their waterfalls.\nSignificant natural resources in Ukraine include lithium, natural gas, kaolin, timber, and an abundance of arable land. Despite this, the country faces a number of major environmental issues such as inadequate supplies of potable water, air and water pollution, deforestation, and radioactive contamination in the north-east from the 1986 accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant.\nGeographic location.\nUkraine is located in Eastern Europe: lying on the northern shores of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. The country borders Belarus in the north, Poland, Slovakia and Hungary in the west, Moldova and Romania in the south-west, and Russia in the east.\nThe total geographic area of Ukraine is . Ukraine has an Exclusive Economic Zone of in the Black Sea.\nThe land border of Ukraine totals . The border lengths with each country are: Belarus , Hungary , Moldova , Poland , Romania on the south and on the west, Russia , and Slovakia . Ukraine is also bordered by of coastline. The border with Russia, part of which runs through the Sea of Azov, is the country's longest border.\nThe village of Vel'k\u00e9 Slemence is split between Slovakia and Ukraine.\nRelief.\nMost of its territory lies within the Great European Plain, while parts of western regions and southern regions lay within the Alpine system. In general Ukraine comprises two different biomes: mixed forest towards the middle of the continent, and steppe towards the Black Sea littoral. Major provinces include, Polesian Lowland, Dnieper Lowland, Volhynia-Podolie Plateau, Black Sea-Azov Lowland, Donets-Azov Plateau, Central Russian Upland, Carpathians, and Pannonian Basin.\nThe western regions feature an alpine-like section of Carpathian Mountains, the Eastern Carpathians that stretches across Poland, Ukraine and Romania. The highest peak is Mount Hoverla, which at above sea level is the highest point in the country. Mountains are limited to the west, the southern tip of Ukraine on the Sea of Azov. The western region has the Carpathian Mountains, and some eroded mountains from the Donets Ridge are in the east near the Sea of Azov.\nMost of Ukraine's area is taken up by the steppe-like region just north of the Black Sea. Most of Ukraine consists of fertile plains (or steppes) and plateaus. In terms of land use, 58% of Ukraine is considered arable land; 2% is used for permanent crops, 13% for permanent pastures, 18% is forests and woodland, and 9% is other.\nPhysiographic division of Ukraine.\nMost of Ukraine consists of regular plains with an average height above sea level being . It is surrounded by mountains to its west and extreme south. Wide spaces of the country's plains are located in the south-western part of the East European Plain. The plains have numerous highlands and lowlands caused by the uneven crystallized base of the East European craton. The highlands are characterized by Precambrian basement rocks from the Ukrainian Shield.\nPlains are considered elevations of no more than among which there are recognized lowlands (plains) and uplands (plateaus, ridges, hill ridges).\nSoil.\nFrom northwest to southeast the soils of Ukraine may be divided into three major aggregations:\nAs much as two-thirds of the country's surface land consists of black earth, a resource that has made Ukraine one of the most fertile regions in the world and well known as a \"breadbasket\". These soils may be divided into three broad groups:\nInterspersed in various uplands and along the northern and western perimeters of the deep chernozems are mixtures of gray forest soils and podzolized black-earth soils, which together occupy much of Ukraine's remaining area. All these soils are very fertile when sufficient water is available. However, their intensive cultivation, especially on steep slopes, has led to widespread soil erosion and gullying.\nThe smallest proportion of the soil cover consists of the chestnut soils of the southern and eastern regions. They become increasingly salinized to the south as they approach the Black Sea.\nHydrography.\nThe territory of Ukraine is bordered by the waters of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. More than 95% of the rivers are part of those two seas' drainage basins. A few rivers are part of the Baltic Sea basin. There are seven major rivers in Ukraine: Desna, Dnipro, Dnister, Danube, Prypiat, Siverian Donets, and Southern Buh.\nClimate.\nUkraine is firmly in the mid-latitudes, and generally has a continental climate, except for its southern coasts, which feature cold semi-arid and humid subtropical climates. Average annual temperatures range from in the north, to in the south. Precipitation is disproportionately distributed; it is highest in the west and north and lowest in the east and southeast. Western Ukraine, particularly in the Carpathian Mountains, receives around of precipitation annually, while Crimea and the coastal areas of the Black Sea receive around .\nWater availability from the major river basins is expected to decrease, especially in summer. This poses risks to the agricultural sector. The negative impacts of climate change on agriculture are mostly felt in the south of the country, which has a steppe climate. In the north, some crops may be able to benefit from a longer growing season. The World Bank has stated that Ukraine is highly vulnerable to climate change.\nNatural resources.\nSignificant natural resources in Ukraine include: iron ore, manganese, natural gas, titanium, kaolin, uranium, and arable land.\nEnvironmental issues.\nUkraine has many environmental issues. Some regions lack adequate supplies of potable water. Air and water pollution affects the country, as well as deforestation, and radiation contamination in the northeast stemming from the 1986 accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31827", "revid": "211905", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31827", "title": "Demographics of Ukraine", "text": "According to the United Nations, Ukraine has a population of 37.9 million as of 2024.\nIn July 2023, Reuters reported that due to refugee outflows, the population of Ukrainian-controlled areas may have decreased to 28 million, a steep decline from Ukraine's 2020 population of almost 42 million.\nThis drop is in large part due to the ongoing Ukrainian refugee crisis and loss of territory caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which resulted in mass emigration from the Ukrainian people. The demographic decline is also affected by a very low birth rate and a high death rate. The most recent (and only) census of post-Soviet Ukraine occurred in 2001, and much of the information presented is potentially inaccurate or outdated.\nSince 2021, the Ukrainian fertility rate has fallen below 1.3, and is now one of the lowest in the world. By 2024, it was one of the ten lowest in the world, falling under 1.00.\nHistory.\nHistorical Population.\nThere were roughly four million Ukrainians at the end of the 17th century. However, population estimates from this period are approximate and may vary depending on methodology and available records.\nThe estimated population figures for Ukraine in the early 20th century are based on various sources. The 1931 population statistics were estimated by Professor Zenon Kuzelia, as an official census was not conducted in Soviet Ukraine during that year.\nPopulation Change.\nThe following graph represents Ukraine's population trends since the early 20th century.\nData for 1926\u20132001 is based on official Soviet and Ukrainian censuses. The 2014 and 2020 figures are adjusted estimates, excluding Crimea and occupied territories in Donbas.\nNatural Change and Migration.\nThe natural population change, migration trends, and fertility rates are shown below:\nNatural population change and migration data are sourced from the Ukrainian State Statistics Service. The fertility rate figures are derived from United Nations estimates.\nFamines and migration.\nDemographic impact of the Holodomor and World War II.\nThe Ukrainian famines of the 1930s and the devastation of World War II created a demographic catastrophe for Ukraine. In 1933, life expectancy at birth dropped to as low as 10 years for females and 7 years for males. During 1941\u20131944, life expectancy plateaued around 25 years for females and 15 years for males.\nAccording to \"The Oxford Companion to World War II\", over 7 million Ukrainians \u2014 more than one-sixth of the pre-war population \u2014 were killed during the conflict.\nMigration trends in independent Ukraine.\nFollowing Ukraine's independence, significant migration occurred:\nAs of 2015, immigrants made up an estimated 11.4% of the total population of Ukraine, equating to 4.8 million people.\nUkrainian diaspora.\nIn 2006, there were approximately 1.2 million Canadians of Ukrainian descent, giving Canada the third-largest Ukrainian population worldwide, behind Ukraine and Russia. Significant Ukrainian diaspora communities also exist in Poland, the United States, Brazil, Kazakhstan, and Argentina.\nRecent migration trends and economic impact.\nSince about 2015, a growing number of Ukrainians have worked in the European Union, particularly in Poland. According to Eurostat, 662,000 Ukrainians received EU residence permits in 2017, with 585,439 of these residing in Poland.\nWorld Bank statistics from 2019 revealed that remittances sent back to Ukraine had approximately doubled from 2015 to 2018, making up about 4% of Ukraine's GDP.\nUkraine records only citizens who apply for foreign citizenship, not those who seek foreign residency.\nMigration during the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nWith the Russian invasion of Ukraine, approximately 8 million people fled Ukraine during the ensuing Ukrainian refugee crisis, Europe's largest refugee crisis since World War II. Most refugees sought asylum in Central Europe.\nPopulation Decline.\nAccording to estimates by the State Statistics Service of Ukraine, the population of Ukraine (excluding Crimea) on 1 May 2021 was 41,442,615.\nThe country's population has been declining since the 1990s because of a high emigration rate, coupled with high death rates and low birth rates. The population has been shrinking by an average of over 300,000 annually since 1993.\nIn 2007, the country's rate of population decline was the fourth highest in the world.\nBut between 2008 and 2010, over 1.5 million children were born in Ukraine, compared with fewer than 1.2 million in 1999\u20132001. In 2008, Ukraine posted record-breaking birth rates not seen since its 1991 independence. Infant mortality rates also dropped from 10.4 deaths to 8.3 per 1,000 children under one year of age, a lower rate than in 153 other countries.\nIn 2019, the Ukrainian government conducted an electronic census using multiple sources, including mobile phone and pension data, and estimated that Ukraine's population, excluding Crimea and parts of the Donbas, to be 37.3 million. About 20 million were of active working age.\nThe Russian invasion considerably deepened the country's demographic crisis due to the military occupation and forced annexation of multiple oblasts, numerous civilians fleeing the country, and high casualties. A July 2023 study by the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies stated the following:\"Regardless of how long the war lasts and whether or not there is further military escalation, Ukraine is unlikely to recover demographically from the consequences of the war. Even in 2040 it will have only about 35 million inhabitants, around 20% fewer than before the war (2021: 42.8 million) and the decline in the working-age population is likely to be the most severe and far-reaching.\"The study examined different scenarios, from a \"best case\", in which the war ended in 2023 without significant further escalation, to a \"worst case\", ending in 2025 after further escalation. Flight from war particularly affects the southern and eastern regions and especially educated women of child-bearing age and their children. With an estimate of more than 20% of refugees not returning, the author of the study Maryna Tverdostup concludes that this will lead to long-term shrinking and will significantly impair the conditions for reconstruction.\nFertility and natalist policies.\nAs of 2020, the birth rate in Ukraine was 8.1 live births/1,000 population, and the death rate 14.7 deaths/1,000 population.\nLowest-low fertility, defined as total fertility below 1.3, is being encountered across Europe, attributed by many to postponement of the initiation of childbearing. Ukraine, where total fertility (1.1 in 2001), was one of the world's lowest, shows that there is more than one pathway to lowest-low fertility. Although Ukraine underwent immense political and economic transformations from 1991 to 2004, it maintained a young age at first birth and nearly universal childbearing. Analysis of official national statistics and the Ukrainian Reproductive Health Survey show that fertility declined to very low levels without a transition to a later pattern of childbearing. Findings from focus group interviews suggest that the early fertility pattern was explained by the persistence of traditional norms for childbearing and the roles of men and women, concerns about medical complications and infertility at a later age, and the link between early fertility and early marriage. Ukraine subsequently has one of the oldest populations in the world, with an average age of 40.8 years.\nTo help mitigate population decline, the government increased child support payments, providing one-time payments of 12,250 hryvnias for the first child, 25,000 hryvnias for the second and 50,000 hryvnias for the third and fourth, along with monthly payments of 154 hryvnias per child. The demographic trend showed signs of improvement as the birth rate grew steadily from 2001 to 2013. Five of the country's 24 provinces showed net population growth over the first nine months of 2007, and nationwide population decline showed signs of stabilization. In 2007, the highest birth rates were in the western oblasts. In 2008, Ukraine emerged from lowest-low fertility, and the upward trend continued to 2012, with population decline slowing year after year. If early 2010s trends had persisted, the population could have returned to positive growth later that decade. Similar trends occurred in Russia and Belarus, which experienced population growth in the 2010s.\nIn 2014, the strong drop in births returned, and 2018 saw fewer than half the number of births of 1989 (see demographic tables). In 2020, the number of births decreased to 293,000, reaching rates not seen in a quarter century.\nMass emigration and property destruction caused by the Russian invasion led Ukraine's birth to drop still further: it was 28% lower in the first half of 2023 than the first half of 2021. However, a small but meaningful increase in births may have occurred, with a potential fertility rate increase to 1.60 children per woman, higher than the 2012 peak of 1.53.\nPopulation.\nLife expectancy.\nAverage life expectancy at birth of the total population.\nVital statistics.\nNotable events in Ukrainian demographics:\nUkrainian provinces of the Russian Empire (1900-1914).\nThe figures below refer to the nine governorates of the Russian Empire (Volhynia, Katerynoslav, Kyiv, Podilia, Poltava, Tauryda, Kharkiv, Kherson and Chernihiv) with a Ukrainian majority.\nNote: This table uses the sticky table format to make scrolling easier.

Of the total Ukrainian population, 87.4% declared they were Christians, comprising 67.3% who declared themselves Eastern Orthodox, 10.2% Catholics (split into 9.4% Ukrainian Greek Catholics and 0.8% Latin Catholics), 7.7% \"Christians\", and 2.2% Protestants. Judaism comprises 0.4% of the population. In earlier surveys, between 1 and 2% of the population stated that it adhered to Islam.\nAccording to data from 2018, among those Ukrainians declaring themselves Orthodox Christians, 28.7% said they were members of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kyivan Patriarchate (incorporated as of 5 January 2019 into the Orthodox Church of Ukraine), while 12.8% said they were members of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscovian Patriarchate (an autonomous Eastern Orthodox church under the Russian Orthodox Church). A further 0.3% said they were members of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church, which, like the Kyivan Patriarchate, was incorporated in 2019 into the Orthodox Church of Ukraine. Among the remaining Orthodox Ukrainians, 23.4% declared themselves \"simply Orthodox\", without affiliation to any patriarchate, while a further 1.9% declared that they \"did not know\" which patriarchate or Orthodox church they belonged to.\nRegional differences.\nRegional differences in population change.\nBetween the Soviet census of 1989 and the Ukrainian census of 2001, Ukraine's population declined from 51,706,600 to 48,457,020, a loss of 2,926,700 people, or 5.7% of the 1989 population. However, this trend was quite uneven and subject to regional variation. Two oblasts in western Ukraine, Rivne and Zakarpattia, saw slight population increases of 0.3% and 0.5%, respectively. A third western Ukrainian oblast, Volyn, lost less than 0.1% of its population between 1989 and 2001. Collectively, between 1989 and 2001, the seven westernmost Ukrainian oblasts lost 167,500 people, or 1.7% of their 1989 population. The total population of these oblasts in 2001 was 9,593,800.\nBetween 1989 and 2001, the population of Kyiv City increased by 0.3% due to positive net migration. Outside Kyiv, the central, southern and eastern oblasts experienced a severe population declines. Between 1989 and 2001, the Donetsk Oblast lost 491,300 people, or 9.2% of its 1989 population, while the neighbouring Luhansk Oblast lost 11% of its population. Chernihiv Obast, in central Ukraine (northeast of Kyiv), lost 170,600 people, or 12% of its 1989 population, the highest percentage loss in of any Ukrainian oblast. In southern Ukraine, Odesa Oblast lost 173,600 people, or 6.6% of its 1989 population.\nBy 2001, Crimea's population declined by 29,900, representing only a 1.4% loss of its 1989 population. This however was due to the influx of approximately 200,000 Crimean Tatars\u00a0\u2013 equivalent to approximately 10% of Crimea's 1989 population\u00a0\u2013 who arrived in Crimea after 1989 and whose population in that region increased by a factor of 6.4 (from 38,000 to 243,400 between 1989 and 2001). Collectively, the net population loss in Ukraine outside the westernmost oblasts was 2,759,200, or 6.6% of the 1989 population. The total population of these regions in 2001 was 39,186,100.\nOverall in 1989\u20132001, the pattern of population change was one of slight growth in Kyiv, slight declines in western Ukraine, large declines in eastern, central and southern Ukraine, and a relatively small decline in Crimea due to a large influx of Crimean Tatars.\nRegional differences in birth and fertility rates.\nUkraine's total fertility rate is one of the lowest in Europe. However, significant regional differences in birth rates may account for some of the demographic differences. In the third quarter of 2007, for instance, the highest birth rate among Ukrainian oblasts occurred in Volyn Oblast, with a birth rate of 13.4/1,000 people, compared to the Ukrainian countrywide average of 9.6/1,000 people. Volyn's birthrate was higher than the average birth rate of any European country except Iceland and Albania.\nIn 2007, for the first time since 1990, five Ukrainian oblasts (Zakarpattia, Rivne, Volyn, Lviv, and Kyiv oblasts) experienced more births than deaths. This demonstrated a positive trend of increasing birthrates in the preceding years throughout Ukraine. The ratio of births to deaths in those oblasts in 2007 was 119%, 117%, 110%, 100.7%, and 108%, respectively.\nWith the exception of the Kyiv Oblast, all of the oblasts with more births than deaths were in the less-industrially developed oblasts of western Ukraine. According to a spokesperson for Ukraine's Ministry of Justice, the overall ratio of births to deaths in Ukraine improved from 1 to 1.7 in 2004\u20132005 to 1 to 1.4 in 2008. However, the worst birth-to-death ratios in the country were in the eastern and central oblasts of Donetsk, Luhansk, Cherkasy and Poltava. These areas saw 2.1 deaths for every birth.\nNotably, western Ukraine never experienced the Holodomor, as Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Romania ruled it at the time, helping to understand the more favorable demographic trends there, as the rural population was never devastated. Specifically, during the Holodomor, Poland ruled Ivano-Frankivsk, Lviv, Rivne, Ternopil, and Volyn oblasts, whereas Zakarpattia Oblast was under Czechoslovak rule, and Romania controlled Chernivtsi Oblast and the Budjak section of Odesa Oblast.\nWhile abortion rates in the North, South, East and Center of Ukraine are relatively homogeneous, the Western region differs greatly. Overall, the abortion rate in western Ukraine is three times lower than in other regions. This is not due to increased use of modern contraceptive methods in the West, but to the fact that pregnant women in the Western regions are more likely to keep their babies. Donetsk and Dniproptrovsk oblasts in eastern and central Ukraine have the country's highest abortion rate.\nRegional differences in death rates and health.\nDeath rates also vary widely by region; eastern and southern Ukraine have the highest death rates in the country, and the life expectancy for children born in Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Kherson, Kropyvnytskyi, Luhansk, Mikolaiv, and Odesa oblasts is 1.5 years lower than the national average.\nUkraine had a suicide rate of 16.5 per 100,000 population in 2017, a significant decrease from the suicide rate of 29.6 per 100,000 in 1998. Suicides were more frequent in the central part of the country (the highest suicide rate was in Kirovohrad Oblast; in western Ukraine, the suicide rate was lower than the national average. Lviv Oblast had the lowest suicide rate (5.3).\nSouthern and eastern Ukraine also suffered from the highest rates of HIV and AIDS, which impacts life expectancy. In late 2000, 60% of all AIDS cases in Ukraine were concentrated in the Odesa, Dnipropetrovsk, and Donetsk oblasts. A major reason behind the higher rates was that the urbanized and industrialized oblasts in the East and South of Ukraine suffered most from the economic crisis in the 1990s, leading to the increased spread of unemployment, alcoholism, and drug abuse, setting the conditions for a wider spread of the epidemic.\nRegional differences in income.\nThe western and central oblasts of Ukraine had lower GDP per capita than Kyiv and the industrialized eastern oblasts of Ukraine. In December 2019, the average monthly salary in Ukraine was 12,264 hryvnias (519 US dollars). Chernihiv Oblast (northern Ukraine) and Kirovohrad Oblast (central Ukraine) had the lowest monthly salary of 8,851 and 9,450 hryvnias, respectively. In contrast, the monthly wage in the city of Kyiv was 18,869 hryvnias per month, and in Kyiv Oblast, 13,259 per month. In 2013, outside of the capital city of Kyiv, the wealthiest oblast was Donetsk with an annual income of 31,048 hryvnias. But as of 2017, it ranked second poorest after Luhansk Oblast, with annual incomes 25,278 hryvnias and 16,416 hryvnias, respectively. Both are in eastern Ukraine and sustained direct losses as a consequence of military actions.\nUkraine recorded one of the sharpest declines in poverty of any transition economy in 2001\u20132016. The poverty rate, measured against an absolute poverty line (below $1.25 per day, based on World Bank numbers) fell from a high of 32 percent in 2001 to 8 percent in 2005. In terms of poverty rates, the central and northern oblasts have the country's highest poverty rates: 10.0%. The western and southern oblasts are 9.1% and 9%, respectively. Kyiv City had the lowest poverty rate: 1.4%.\nThe percent of the population living under $5.50 a day was 19% in 2005 and dropped to 4.0 percent in 2018.\nMigration.\nEmigration.\nUkraine is the major source of migrants for many EU member states. In the 1990s and early 2000s, Ukraine's sputtering economy and political instability contributed to rising emigration, especially to nearby Poland and Hungary, but also to other countries such as Italy, Portugal, Spain, Israel and Canada. Although estimates vary, approximately two to three million Ukrainian citizens were working abroad, in construction, service, housekeeping, and agriculture industries.\nBetween 1991 and 2004, the government counted 2,537,400 individuals who emigrated; 1,897,500 moved to other post-Soviet states, and 639,900 moved to other, mainly Western, states.\nBy the early 2000s, Ukrainian embassies reported that 300,000 Ukrainian citizens were working in Poland, 200,000 in Italy, approximately 200,000 in the Czech Republic, 150,000 in Portugal, 100,000 in Spain, 35,000 in Turkey, 20,000 in the United States and smaller but significant numbers in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The largest number of Ukrainian workers abroad, about one million, were in Russia. Since 1992, 232,072 persons born in Ukraine have emigrated to the United States.\nYet absolute numbers are less relevant to the economic impact on host countries than the volume of immigration as a proportion of the native population. Italy had the highest rate of Ukrainian emigrants as a proportion of the native population, while the far more populous Russia had the largest absolute confirmed number of Ukrainian emigrants (excluding Poland, Portugal and the Czech Republic, for which there was conflicting data).\nImmigration.\nBetween 1991 and 2003, about 100,000 illegal immigrants were detained at the western borders of Ukraine. As of 2005, about 5,000 illegal immigrants were being detained yearly, mostly from China, India, Pakistan and Afghanistan. At the time, about 3,000 officially registered refugees resided in Ukraine, of whom most were Afghans.\nUkraine accepted some 62,000 refugees from Transnistria following its war in 1992. That same decade, thousands more were also accepted from other post-Soviet conflict zones in Abkhazia, Chechnya and Tajikistan.\nBetween the 1989 Soviet census and the 2001 census, an increased number of former CIS residents moved to Ukraine from war zones. The number of Armenians in Ukraine almost doubled to 99,900 people during this period, while the number of Georgians and Azerbaijanis also increased substantially.\nAs of April 2020, 1.4 million Ukrainians were internally displaced due to the war in Donbas.\nSee also.\nGeneral:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31828", "revid": "47768666", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31828", "title": "Politics of Ukraine", "text": " \nThe politics of Ukraine take place in a framework of a semi-presidential republic and a multi-party system. A Cabinet of Ministers exercises executive power (jointly with the president until 1996). Legislative power is vested in Ukraine's parliament, the Verkhovna Rada ().\nAs part of the Soviet Union as the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic until 1991, the political system featured a single-party socialist-republic framework characterized by the superior role of the Communist Party of Ukraine (CPU), the sole-governing party then permitted by the Ukrainian SSR's constitution. In 1996, the current constitution replaced the previous constitution that was introduced in 1978.\nThe condemned Russian annexations of Crimea in 2014 and of Donetsk and Luhansk in 2022 have complicated the \"de facto\" political situation associated with those areas.\nConstitution and fundamental freedoms.\nShortly after becoming independent in 1991, Ukraine named a parliamentary commission to prepare a new constitution, adopted a multi-party system, and adopted legislative guarantees of civil and political rights for national minorities. A new, democratic constitution was adopted on 28 June 1996, which mandates a pluralistic political system with protection of basic human rights and liberties, and a semi-presidential form of government.\nThe Constitution was amended in December 2004 to ease the resolution of the 2004 presidential election crisis. The consociationalist agreement transformed the form of government in a semi-presidentialism in which the president of Ukraine had to cohabit with a powerful prime minister. The Constitutional Amendments took force between January and May 2006.\nThe Constitutional Court of Ukraine in October 2010 overturned the 2004 amendments, considering them unconstitutional. On 18 November 2010, The Venice Commission published its report titled \"The Opinion of the Constitutional Situation in Ukraine in Review of the Judgement of Ukraine's Constitutional Court\", in which it stated \"It also considers highly unusual that far-reaching constitutional amendments, including the change of the political system of the country - from a parliamentary system to a parliamentary presidential one - are declared unconstitutional by a decision of the Constitutional Court after a period of 6 years. ... As Constitutional Courts are bound by the Constitution and do not stand above it, such decisions raise important questions of democratic legitimacy and the rule of law\".\nOn 21 February 2014, the parliament passed a law that reinstated the 8 December 2004 amendments of the constitution. This was passed under simplified procedure without any decision of the relevant committee and was passed in the first and the second reading in one voting by 386 deputies. The law was approved by 140 MPs of the Party of Regions, 89 MPs of Batkivshchyna, 40 MPs of UDAR, 32 of the Communist Party, and 50 independent lawmakers. According to Radio Free Europe, however, the measure was not signed by the then-president Viktor Yanukovych, who was subsequently removed from office.\nOn 3 September 2019, new amendments to the Constitution were passed which abolished the parliamentary immunity for the deputies of the Verkhovna Rada, with the exception that they were immune for the results of voting or their statements in the parliament, but they are liable for insult or defamation. New revision came into force on 1 January 2020.\nFundamental Freedoms and basic elements of constitutional system.\nArticle 1 of the Constitution establishes Ukraine as a sovereign and independent, democratic, social, law-based state.\nArticle 5 of the Constitution defines Ukraine as a republic. The people are the bearer of sovereignty and the sole source of power in Ukraine, and exercise power directly and through the government authorities and local government. No one must usurp state power.\nArticle 15 of the Constitution states that social life in Ukraine must be based on the principles of political, economic, and ideological diversity. No ideology is recognised as mandatory by the State. Censorship is prohibited. The State guarantees the freedom of political activities not prohibited by the Constitution and the laws of Ukraine.\nFreedom of religion is guaranteed by law, although religious organizations are required to register with local authorities and with the central government. Article 35 of the Constitution defines that no religion may be recognized by the state as mandatory, while church and religious organizations in Ukraine are separated from the state.\nMinority rights are respected in accordance with a 1991 law guaranteeing ethnic minorities the right to schools, educational buildings, and cultural facilities and the use of national languages in conducting personal business.\n11 Article of the Constitution states that State must promote the consolidation and development of the Ukrainian nation, its historical consciousness, traditions, and culture, as well as the development of ethnic, cultural, linguistic, and religious identity of all indigenous peoples and national minorities of Ukraine.\nAccording to Article 10 of Ukrainian constitution, Ukrainian is the only official state language. However, in Crimea and some parts of eastern Ukraine \u2013 areas which also include substantial ethnic Russian minorities \u2013 the use of Russian is widespread.\nFreedom of speech and press are guaranteed by law, but authorities sometimes interfere with the news media through different forms of pressure (see Freedom of the press in Ukraine). In particular, the failure of the government to conduct a thorough, credible, and transparent investigation into the 2000 disappearance and murder of independent journalist Georgiy Gongadze has had a negative effect on Ukraine's international image. Over half of Ukrainians polled by the Razumkov Center in early October 2010 (56.6%) believed political censorship existed in Ukraine.\nOfficial labor unions have been grouped under the Federation of Labor Unions. A number of independent unions, which emerged in 1992, among them the Independent Union of Miners of Ukraine, have formed the Consultative Council of Free Labor Unions. While the right to strike is legally guaranteed by the Constitution, strikes based solely on political demands are prohibited.\nArticle 157 of the Constitution prohibits amendments to the Constitution of Ukraine \"under conditions of martial law or a state of emergency.\" Elections, referendums, strikes, mass gatherings and protests are prohibited during martial law.\nExecutive branch.\nThe president is elected by popular vote for a five-year term. The president nominates the prime minister, who must be confirmed by parliament. The prime minister and cabinet are \"de jure\" appointed by the Parliament on submission of the president and prime minister, respectively. of the Constitution of Ukraine.\nLegislative branch.\nThe Verkhovna Rada (Parliament of Ukraine) has 450 members, elected for a five-year term. Prior to 2006, half of the members were elected by proportional representation, and the other half by single-seat constituencies. In the 2006 and 2007 Ukrainian parliamentary elections, all 450 members of the Verkhovna Rada were elected by party-list proportional representation, but the system returned to parallel voting in 2012. In 2019 the Electoral Code was adopted, according to which, all members of parliament will be elected exclusively on open party lists.\nThe Verkhovna Rada initiates legislation, ratifies international agreements, and approves the budget.\nPolitical parties and elections.\nUkrainian parties tend not to have clear-cut ideologies but are incline to centre around civilizational and geostrategic orientations (rather than economic and socio-political agendas, as in Western politics), around personalities and business interests.\nParty membership is lower than 1% of the population eligible to vote (compared to an average of 4.7% in the European Union).\nJudicial branch.\n\"constitutional jurisdiction\":\n\"general jurisdiction\":\nLaws, acts of the parliament and the Cabinet, presidential edicts, and acts of the Crimean parliament (Autonomous Republic of Crimea) may be nullified by the Constitutional Court of Ukraine when they are found to violate the Constitution of Ukraine. Other normative acts are subject to judicial review. The Supreme Court of Ukraine is the main body in the system of courts of general jurisdiction.\nThe Constitution of Ukraine provides for trials by jury. This has not yet been implemented in practice. Moreover, some courts provided for by legislation as still in project, as is the case for, e.g., the Court of Appeals of Ukraine. The reform of the judicial branch is presently underway.\nImportant is also the Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine, granted the broad rights of control and supervision.\nAdministrative divisions.\nUkraine is divided into 24 oblasts (regions). Each oblast is divided into raions (districts). The current administrative divisions remain the same as the local administrations of Soviet Ukraine. The heads of the oblasts and raions are appointed and dismissed by the president of Ukraine. They serve as representatives of the central government in Kyiv. They govern over locally elected assemblies. This system encourages regional elites to compete fiercely for control over the central government and the position of the president.\nAutonomous Republic of Crimea.\nIn 1992, a number of pro-Russian political organizations in Crimea advocated the secession of Crimea and annexation into Russia. During USSR times Crimea was ceded from Russia to Ukraine in 1954 by First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev to mark the 300th anniversary of the Treaty of Pereyaslav. In July 1992, the Crimean and Ukrainian parliaments determined that Crimea would remain under Ukrainian jurisdiction while retaining significant cultural and economic autonomy, thus creating the Autonomous Republic of Crimea.\nThe Crimean peninsula\u2014while under Ukrainian sovereignty, served as a site for major military bases of both Ukrainian and Russian forces, and was heavily populated by ethnic Russians.\nIn early 2014, Ukraine's pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych, was ousted by Ukrainians over his refusal to ally Ukraine with the European Union, rather than Russia. In response, Russia invaded Crimea in February 2014 and occupied it.\nIn March 2014, during occupation a controversial referendum was held in Crimea with 97% of voters backing joining Russia.\nOn 18 March 2014, Russia and the new, self-proclaimed Republic of Crimea signed a treaty of accession of the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol in the Russian Federation. In response, the UN General Assembly passed non-binding resolution 68/262 declaring the referendum invalid and officially supporting Ukraine's claim to Crimea. Although Russia administers the peninsula as two federal subjects, Ukraine and the majority of countries do not recognise Russia's annexation.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31829", "revid": "51024534", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31829", "title": "Economy of Ukraine", "text": "The economy of Ukraine is a developing social market economy. It possesses many of the components of a major European economy, such as rich farmlands, a well-developed industrial base, highly-trained labour, and a good education system. Ukraine has large mineral deposits across its landmass.\nThe depression during the 1990s included hyperinflation and a fall in economic output to less than half of the GDP of the preceding Ukrainian SSR. GDP growth was recorded for the first time in 2000, and continued for eight years. This growth was halted by the 2008 financial crisis. It grew rapidly from 2000 until the 2008\u20132009 Ukrainian financial crisis. The economy recovered in 2010 and continued improving until 2013. The Euromaidan in Ukraine caused a severe economic decline from 2014 to 2015, with the country's gross domestic product in 2015 surpassing half of what it was in 2013. In 2016, the economy again started to grow. By 2018, the Ukrainian economy was growing rapidly, and reached almost 80% of its size in 2008.\nIn October 2013, the Ukrainian economy lapsed into another recession. The previous summer, Ukrainian exports to Russia substantially declined due to stricter border and customs control by Russia. The early 2014 annexation of Crimea by Russia, and the war in Donbas that started in the spring of 2014 severely damaged Ukraine's economy and two of Ukraine's most industrial regions. In 2013, Ukraine saw zero GDP growth. Ukraine's economy shrank by 6.8% in 2014, and this continued with a 12% decline in GDP in 2015. In April 2017, the World Bank stated that Ukraine's economic growth rate was 2.3% in 2016, ending the recession. Despite these improvements, Ukraine remains one of the poorest countries in Europe, which some have attributed to high corruption levels and the slow pace of economic liberalisation and institutional reform.\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 deteriorated the country's economy. GDP in U.S. dollar terms decreased by 18.9%. However, even under such challenging conditions, Ukraine's economy returned to growth the following year. In 2023, GDP in U.S. dollar terms expanded by 11.9%, followed by an additional 5.3% increase in 2024.\nHistory.\nBefore 1917.\nGeography has long influenced the economy of the Ukrainian lands. Rich fertile soils (such as chernozem areas) made the area a \"breadbasket\": for ancient Greece as well as for early modern Europe. The maintenance of trade corridors \u2013 the route from the Varangians to the Greeks and access through the Straits to the Mediterranean world \u2013 became important. Mineral resources encouraged industrialisation \u2013 notably in the Donbas \u2013 from the 19th century onwards.\nThe lack of secure borders meant repeated interruptions in economic development. Steppe nomads and other conquerors \u2013 Cumans, Mongols, Tatars for example, sometimes saw plundering as more important than fostering economic development. In the 16th to 18th centuries, the wastelands of the Wild Fields left much of Ukraine as an area of tentatively militarised outposts, prior to tsarist Russia's extension of its power into the region in the 17th and 18th centuries.\n1991 to 2000.\nOn 24 August 1991, Ukraine established its independence from the Soviet Union. The new state's economy suffered huge output declines and soaring inflation in the following years. Ukraine saw hyperinflation in the early 1990s because of a lack of access to financial markets and massive monetary expansion to finance government spending, while output declined sharply this was catastrophic for the economy because it undid decades of hard-fought economic progress and people became poorer. Huge output declines and soaring inflation was at the time common to most former Soviet republics, but Ukraine was among the hardest hit by these problems.\nIn response to hyperinflation the National Bank of Ukraine replaced the national currency, the karbovanets, with the hryvnia in September 1996 and pledged to keep it stable in relation to the U.S. dollar. The currency remained unstable through the late 1990s, particularly during the 1998 Russian financial crisis.\nDeep recession during the 1990s led to a relatively high poverty rate, but beginning in 2001, seven straight years of economic growth, raised the living standard for most citizens. A World Bank report in 2007 noted that: \"Ukraine recorded one of the sharpest declines in poverty of any transition economy in recent years. The poverty rate, measured against an absolute poverty line, fell from a high of 32% in 2001 to 8% in 2005.\" The UN noted that Ukraine had overcome absolute poverty, and that there was only relative poverty in 2009.\n2000 to 2014.\nUkraine stabilised by the early 2000s. The year 2000 saw the first year of economic growth since Ukraine's independence. The economy continued to grow thanks to a 50% growth in exports between 2000 and 2008 \u2013 mainly exports from the traditional industries of metals, metallurgy, engineering, chemicals, and food. Between 2001 and 2008, metals and chemicals prices boomed because of fast international economic growth, while the price of natural gas imported from Russia remained low.\nMonetisation also helped to drive the economic boom Ukraine experienced between 2000 and 2008. Attracted in part by relatively high interest-rates, foreign cash was injected into Ukraine's economy and money supply grew rapidly: from 2001 to 2010 broad, money increased at an annual rate of 35%. In 2006 and 2007, credit growth averaged 73%.\nAn effect of this was that Ukrainian assets began to look like a large economic bubble and high inflation started to damage Ukraine's export competitiveness. The ratio of credit to GDP grew extremely fast \u2013 from 7% to almost 80% over just several years. From 2000 to 2007, Ukraine's real growth averaged 7.4%. This growth was driven by domestic demand: orientation toward consumption, other structural change, and financial development.\nDomestic demand grew in constant prices by almost 15% annually. It was supported by expansionary\u2014procyclical\u2014fiscal policy. Ukraine benefited from very low labour costs, slightly lower tariffs, and high prices of its main export goods, but at the same time faced notably higher non-tariff barriers. Russia has not charged Ukraine below-world-market prices for natural gas since the end of 2008. This led to various Russia\u2013Ukraine gas disputes.\nUkraine suffered severely in the economic crisis of 2008. Because of it Ukraine experienced a drought in capital flows. The hryvnia, which had been pegged at a rate of 5:1 to the U.S. dollar, was devalued to 8:1, and was stabilised at that ratio until the beginning of 2014. In 2008, Ukraine's economy ranked 45th in the world according to GDP (nominal), with a total nominal GDP of US$188 billion, and nominal per capita GDP of US$3,900. There was 3% unemployment at the end of 2008. Over the first 9 months of 2009, unemployment averaged 9.4%. The final official unemployment rates for 2009 and 2010 were 8.8% and 8.4%, although the CIA World Factbook notes a \"large number of unregistered or underemployed workers\". Ukraine's GDP fell by 15% in 2009.\nThe Ukrainian economy recovered in the first quarter of 2010 due to the recovery of the world economy and increasing prices for metals. Ukraine's real GDP growth in 2010 was 4.3%, leading to a per capita PPP GDP of US$6,700. In 2011, Ukrainian politicians estimated that 40% of Ukraine's economy was a shadow economy.\nIn the summer of 2013, Ukrainian exports to Russia fell substantially due to Russia's stricter customs controls.\nBy October 2013, the Ukrainian economy had become stuck in recession. Moody's downgraded Ukraine's credit rating to Caa1 (poor quality and very high credit risk) in September 2013. At the time, swap markets rated Ukraine's default probability over the next five years at 50%. In 2013, Ukraine saw no growth in GDP.\nPost-Euromaidan: 2014 to present.\nDue to the loss of Ukraine's largest trading partner, Russia, over the annexation of Crimea in March 2014, and exacerbated by the war in Donbas which started in April 2014 Ukraine's economy shrank by 6.8% in 2014. It had been expected to decline by 8%. A Ukrainian government report stated early in February 2016 that Ukraine's economy had shrunk by 10.4% in 2015. For 2015, the National Bank of Ukraine had expected a further decline of 11.6%, and the World Bank anticipated a 12% shrinkage. The World Bank forecast growth of 1% in 2016.\nEarly in February 2014, the National Bank of Ukraine changed the hryvnia into a fluctuating/floating currency in an attempt to meet IMF requirements and to try to enforce a stable price for the currency in the Forex market. In 2014 and 2015, the hryvnia lost about 70% of its value against the U.S. dollar.\nThe IMF agreed to a four-year loan programme worth about $17.5\u00a0billion in eight tranches over 2015 and 2016, subject to conditions which involved economic reforms. However, due to lack of progress on reforms, only two tranches worth $6.7 billion were paid in 2015. A third tranche of $1.7 billion was provisionally scheduled in June 2016 subject to the bringing into law of 19 further reform measures. Some western analysts believed that large foreign loans were not encouraging reform, but enabling the corrupt extraction of funds out of the country.\nSince December 2015, Ukraine has refused to pay and hence \"de facto\" defaults on a $3 billion debt payment to Russia that formed part of a December 2013 Ukrainian\u2013Russian action plan.\nThe turnover of retail trade in Ukraine in 2014 shrank by 8.6% (from 2013) and shrank by 20.7% in 2015 (from 2014). Ukraine saw a 30.9% decline in exports in 2015, mainly because of a sharp decline in production output in Donetsk Oblast and in Luhansk Oblast (the two regions of the Donbas). These two regions were responsible for 40.6% of the total export-decline rate. Before the war they had been two of the more industrial oblasts of Ukraine.\nAccording to the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade, Ukraine had a surplus in its balance of payments in January\u2013November 2015 of $566\u00a0million and has had a trade deficit of $11.046 billion during the same period in 2014. On 31 December 2015, Ukraine's public debt stood at 79% of its GDP. It had shrunk $4.324 billion in 2015 to end up at $65.488 billion. But calculated in hryvnia, the debt had grown by 42.78%. In 2015, the Ministry of Social Policy of Ukraine rated 20\u201325% of Ukrainian households as poor.\n$2.526 billion entered the Ukrainian economy via remittances in 2015, 34.9% less than in 2014. $431 million was sent from Ukraine to elsewhere using remittances. In January 2016, Bloomberg rated Ukraine's economy as the 41st most innovative in the world, down from 33rd in January 2015.\nIn May 2016, the IMF mission chief for Ukraine, Ron van Rood, stated that reduction of corruption was a key test for continued international support. In February 2016, historian Andrew Wilson assessed progress in reducing corruption as poor as of 2016. Aivaras Abromavi\u010dius, Ukraine's then-Minister of Economy and Trade, resigned in February 2016, citing ingrained corruption. In October of the same year, a survey of potential foreign investors conducted by Dragon Capital identified corruption and lack of trust in the judiciary as the largest obstacles to investment.\nLate in July 2016, the State Statistics Service of Ukraine reported that, compared with June 2015, real wages had increased by 17.3%. Simultaneously the National Bank of Ukraine reported a $406 million surplus in Ukraine's January\u2013June 2016 balance of payments against a deficit of $1.3 billion in the same period in 2015. According to Ukraine's State Statistics Service, inflation in 2016 came down to 13.9%; while it had stood at 43.3% in 2015 and at 24.9% in 2014.\n\"The Economist\" has compared the severity of Ukraine's recession to that of the Greek recession in 2011\u20132012 \u2013 pointing to Ukraine experiencing an 8\u20139% decline in GDP from 2014 to 2015 and Greece experiencing an 8.1% decline of GDP in 2011\u20132012, and noted that not all areas of Ukraine were equally effected by the economic downturn. Donetsk and Luhansk (the conflict zone) saw industrial production falling by 32% and 42% respectively. On the other hand, Lviv, located over 1000\u00a0km from the conflict, posted the largest jump in employment in the nation.\nThe economy of Ukraine has overcome the severe crisis caused by armed conflict in the eastern part of country. A 200% devaluation of the hryvnia in 2014\u20132015 made Ukrainian goods and services cheaper and more competitive. In 2016, for the first time since 2010, the economy grew by more than 2%. A 2017 World Bank statement projected growth of 2% in 2017, of 3.5% in 2018, and of 4% in 2019 and 2020. Inflation in Ukraine in 2017 was 13.7% (12.4% in 2016).\nSince about 2015, there has been a growing number of Ukrainians working in the European Union, particularly Poland. Eurostat reported that 662,000 Ukrainians received EU residence permits in 2017, with 585,439 issued by Poland. The head of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine has estimated that up to 9 million Ukrainians work abroad for some part of the year, and 3.2 million have regular full-time work abroad with most not planning to return. World Bank statistics show that money remittances back to Ukraine have roughly doubled from 2015 to 2018, worth about 4% of GDP.\nIn Q1 2019, China became Ukraine's largest trading partner, replacing Russia. In Q3 of 2019, real GDP grew by 4.2%. The main driving factors include: increased purchasing power of the population in conditions of increase of the level of wages (during nine months of 2019 real wages increased by 9.5%); high level of business activity and preservation of investment activity, which stimulated mainly the development of construction, in particular, of industrial and transport infrastructure facilities; active consumer lending; maintaining the high dynamics of agricultural development; favourable price situation on selected world commodity markets for domestic exports and others. Ukraine made its largest payment on debt in 2019 at $1.1 billion.\nIn 2019, Fitch Ratings, a global leader in credit ratings and research, upgraded Ukraine's Long-Term foreign and National Currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDR) from \"B\u2212\" to \"B\" and improved the outlook on the credit rating from stable to positive. Ukraine has demonstrated timely access to fiscal and external financing, improving macroeconomic stability, and declining public indebtedness.\nUkraine moved up seven positions in the annual World Bank Doing Business 2020 report. Prudent macroeconomic management helped reduce inflation and interest rates in 2019. Inflation eased to 4.1% at the end of 2019 and 2.4% in February 2020.\nIn 2020, Ukraine's GDP fell by 4.4%, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 27 October 2020, the Constitutional Court of Ukraine ruled that anti-corruption legislation, including the mandatory electronic declaration of income, was unconstitutional. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned that if the Ukrainian parliament did not restore these anti-corruption laws, foreign aid, loans and visa-free travel to the European Union were at risk. The governor of the National Bank of Ukraine reported that Ukraine will not receive the scheduled $700 million IMF load before the end of 2020 because of the issue. IMF assessment teams had not visited Kyiv for eight months, which is necessary for further IMF loan tranches to be released. In February 2021, economist Anders \u00c5slund wrote \"for months, senior Ukrainian officials have been claiming that the Ukrainian government has done everything the [IMF] could possibly demand\" but \"this happy talk was always detached from reality\", and the relationship with the IMF remains critical.\nOn 21 July 2022, Ukraine devalued the Ukrainian hryvnia by 25% against the U.S. dollar due to the economic impact of ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, to eliminate currency speculation and to improve the international competitiveness of business. The previous day it requested a two-year payment freeze on international bonds; in 2020 it had $130 billion of external debt. When the 2022 Russian invasion began, Ukraine's economy was predicted by the IMF to shrink by up to 35%. Despite improvements, as in Moldova corruption in Ukraine remains an obstacle to joining the EU; the country was rated 104th out of 180 in the Corruption Perceptions Index for 2023.\nFollowing the onset of the Russian-Ukrainian War in 2022, Ukraine's GDP declined by nearly 30%. Despite economic growth in 2023 and 2024, the economy remains smaller than it was before the war. In 2023, GDP increased by 5.3%, and in 2024 by 3.6%. The International Monetary Fund forecasts that Ukraine's GDP growth will slow to between 2% and 3% in 2025, citing challenges such as labor shortages, damage to energy infrastructure, and the ongoing war.\nEconomic data.\nUkraine is subdivided into nine economic regions: Carpathian, Northwestern, Podillia, Capital, Central-Ukrainian, Northeastern, Black-Sea-Coastal, Trans-Dnipro, and Donetsk. Those regions were redrawn from the three Soviet economic regions of the Ukrainian SSR: Donetsk-TransDnieper, Southwestern, and Southern.\nMain economic indicators.\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1992\u20132023. Inflation below 5% is in green.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Static row numbers/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTrade.\nUntil recently, Russia was Ukraine's largest trading partner with 25.7% of exports and 32.4% of imports in 2012. In 2012, 24.9% of exports and 30.9% of imports were to and from the EU. In 2013, 35.9% of Ukrainian exports went to CIS countries, including eight countries other than Ukraine. Simultaneously, exports to EU countries was 26.6% of all exports.\nIn 2015 the EU became Ukraine's largest trading partner, accounting for more than a third of its trade. In 2015, Ukrainian exports to Russia had fallen to 12.7%. In 2017, 14.5% of Ukraine's imports came from Russia. In 2017, Ukrainian exports to Russia stood at 9%. In 2017, 40% of Ukraine's exports went to the EU and 15% to CIS countries. Overall, Ukraine increased its exports by 20% in 2017. The growth of imports was faster than the rate of export growth.\nIn 2015, food and other agricultural products (worth $13 billion), metallurgy ($8.8 billion) and machinery ($4.1 billion) made up most of Ukraine's exports, with trade partners in 217 countries. Exports from Ukraine in 2015 decreased by 29.3% to $38.135 billion. Imports were 31.1% down, to $37.502 billion. In 2017 almost half of Ukraine's exports were provided by the agrarian complex and food industry, slightly more than 20% by metallurgy and nearly 10% by machine building products.\nIn 2019, China replaced Russia as the largest single-nation trading partner with Ukraine achieved $50.06 billion in export and $60.78 billion in import. Ukraine was the leading agricultural goods provider in the Chinese market.\nNatural gas is Ukraine's biggest import and the main cause of the country's structural trade deficit.\nExports of Ukrainian goods in 2024 reached US$41.73 billion.\nList of major private owned companies, not considering banks and insurance companies.\nSource:\nThe 2016 Ranking of the Top 500 companies of Central and Eastern Europe by Deloitte has come up with specific features of Ukraine's economy. More than 50% of the biggest Ukrainian companies are therefore owned by local investors whereas for the whole region this number accounts only to 15,4%. Deloitte explains the difference with the low investment attractiveness for foreign investors. Furthermore, the biggest Ukrainian companies feature a considerable higher average headcount (35\u2019600 vs. 6\u2019600 employees) and lower productivity (EUR 47\u2019000 revenue per employee vs. EUR 207\u2019000 for the whole region).\nNatural resources.\nUkraine is relatively rich in natural resources, particularly in mineral deposits. Although oil and natural gas reserves in Ukraine are largely exhausted, it has other important energy sources, such as coal, hydroelectricity, and nuclear-fuel raw materials.\nSectors.\nIndustries.\nUkraine is home to companies operating in around 20 major industries, namely power generation, fuel, ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgy, chemical and petrochemical and gas, machine building and metal-working, forest, wood-working and wood pulp and paper, construction materials, light, food, and others. Industry accounted for 26% of GDP in 2012. Ukraine has a massive high-tech industrial base, including electronics, armaments, and space programme.\nMining and production.\nUkraine is one of the world's most important mineral producing countries, in terms of both the range and size of its reserves. There are nearly 8,000 separate deposits, harboring some 90 different minerals, of which about 20 are economically significant. About half of all the known deposits are under exploitation. Coal reserves in Ukraine amount to 47.1 billion tons. The annual domestic demand for coal as fuel is about 100 million tons, of which 85 percent can be satisfied by domestic production.\nUkraine has oil and gas fields that meet 10 percent of its oil and 20 percent of its gas consumption, respectively. Ukraine contains natural gas reserves of , but only about 20 percent of Ukraine's demand is met by domestic production. Deposits of iron ore (estimated at 28 billion tons), manganese ore (3 billion tons), chalk and limestone (1.5 billion tons) are also large in Ukraine. The domestic industrial sector suffers from constant energy shortages and energy supply payment debts totaling about $792 million at the end of 1995. Ukraine increased oil and gas production in 2023 up to 18.7 bcm.\nIn 2019, Ukraine was the 7th largest world producer of iron ore, the world's 8th largest producer of manganese, 6th largest producer of titanium, and 7th largest producer worldwide of graphite. Ukraine was the world's 9th largest producer of uranium in 2018. Before the 2022 escalation of the war with Russia Ukraine supplied about 50% of the world's neon gas and 40% of its krypton, both of which are needed for the production of semiconductors. It is estimated that over 90% of U.S. semiconductor-grade neon supplies were imported from Ukraine.\nIron and steel.\nUkraine is rich in mineral deposits, including iron ore (of which it once produced 50 percent of the entire Soviet output), manganese ore (of which it produced 40 percent of world output during the Soviet era), mercury, titanium, and nickel.\nUkraine has a major ferrous metal industry, producing cast iron, steel, and pipes. Among its economy leading companies in that field are Metinvest, Kryvorizhstal, AzovStal, Ilyich Steel &amp; Iron Works, and others. As of 2012, Ukraine is the world's tenth largest steel producer (according to the World Steel Association).\nChemical industry.\nAn important branch of the economy of Ukraine is the country's chemical industry, which includes the production of coke, mineral fertilizers, and sulfuric acid. Production of coke dropped tremendously due to the Russo-Ukrainian War.\nDefence industry.\nUkraine's defence industry is organised around Ukroboronprom, a state-owned conglomerate of over 130 companies. These companies include Soviet era giants such as Ivchenko-Progress aircraft design bureau that was opened in 1945, to newer companies such as RPC Fort which came into existence in the 1990s. Ukraine is among the top 10 arms exporters in the world.\nThe signing of recent large contracts may put Ukraine into 6th place among biggest arms traders, after the United States, Russia, France, Germany, and Israel. The output of Ukrainian defence plants grew 58% in 2009, with largest growth reported by aircraft builders (77%) and ship builders (71%).\nIn 2013, Ukraine's defence sector manufactured a total of \u20b411.7 billion worth of goods, \u20b410 billion of which were exported. In the first 9 months of 2014, Ukraine's defence sector produced a record \u20b413 billion worth of goods. The increase was largely due to government orders for the war in Donbas.\nFuel and energy complex.\nDue to Ukraine's large population and its significant energy consumption, it is one of the largest energy markets on the European continent. Ukraine's location at the intersection of Europe, Russia, the Black Sea, and the Caspian Sea provides its ample natural resources such as coal, oil, natural gas, as well as significant potential for hydro and biomass energy.\nUkraine relies heavily on imports for natural gas and oil products. It is a key transit site for European imports of Russian gas. Ukraine transits more natural gas than any other country. Prior to the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, economic crises, Russia's closure of its market, and the Russo-Ukrainian War in eastern Ukraine since 2014 had stymied some of the country's growth. Ukraine's energy policy has created incentives for investment in renewable energy sources, but these remain uncertain. Since 2015, Ukrainian energy policy has favoured reducing natural gas subsidies alongside diversifying energy supply. Ukraine participates in the European Union's EU4Energy Programme, an effort to promote evidence-based policy making in national energy sectors.\nFuel industry.\nUkraine remains heavily reliant on oil product and gas imports. Russia ranks as Ukraine's principal supplier of oil, and Russian firms own and/or operate the majority of Ukraine's refining capacity. Natural gas imports come from Russia \u2013 which delivers its own gas, as well as the gas from Turkmenistan.\nUkraine has been a key transit point for EU imports of Russian gas, and its pipeline system has been a crucial player in European energy supply, despite recent diversification of transit routes by Russian oil companies such as Gazprom. Since the 2014 Russia\u2013Ukraine gas disputes, the latter's dependence on Russian gas supplies has dramatically affected its economics and foreign policy.\nUkraine was independent in its electricity supply, and exported electricity to Russia and other countries of Eastern Europe. This was achieved through a wide use of nuclear power and hydroelectricity. Its energy strategy intended a gradual decreasing of gas- and oil-based generation in favour of nuclear power, as well as energy saving measures including lower industrial gas consumption. Reform of the still inefficient and opaque energy sector was a major objective of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank programs with Ukraine.\nUkraine was a partner country of the European Union's INOGATE energy programme, which had four key topics: enhancing energy security, convergence of member state energy markets on the basis of EU internal energy market principles, supporting sustainable energy development, and attracting investment for energy projects of common and regional interest. INOGATE was discontinued in 2016.\nAutomotive industry.\nUkraine automobile manufacturers produce diesel locomotives, tractors, trucks, buses, trolleybuses, own-designed cars and trams. There are 12 automobile manufacturers in Ukraine, including ZAZ, LuAZ, Bogdan, KrAZ, Eurocar, Electron, and LAZ.\nZAZ (Zaporizhzhia Automobile Building Plant) is the main automobile-manufacturer of Ukraine, based in the south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia. Passenger car manufacturing in Ukraine started in 1959. From 1960 to 1994, a total of 3,422,444 Zaporozhets vehicles were manufactured in Zaporizhzhia and engines with air-cooling in Melitopol. In 2011\u20132012, the Zaporizhzhia Automobile Building Plant started serial full-scale production of two new models of vehicle, the ZAZ Forza (a re-badged Chinese Chery A13) and the ZAZ Vida (a re-badged Daewoo Aveo).\nThe Bogdan Corporation is a leading Ukrainian automobile-manufacturing group, including several car- and bus-makers of Ukraine. Bogdan buses (re-badged Isuzu models) are used as the primary small buses in most Ukrainian cities.\nLAZ used to be one of the major bus manufacturers in Ukraine. It manufactured city buses, coach buses, trolley buses, and special purpose buses. The company has been defunct since 2014.\nThe Lviv-based company Electrontrans is an enterprise of a full-scale production, specialising in design and production of modern urban electric transport \u2013 trams, trolleybuses, electric buses, units, and spare parts. In 2013 Electrotrans starts producing low-floor trams, the first Ukrainian 100% low-floor tramways.\nAircraft and aerospace industry.\nUkraine is one of nine countries with a full cycle of aerospace hardware engineering and production. Besides the design and production of passenger and transportation aircraft, Ukraine has a network of aircraft repair enterprises, including companies involved in the recovery of military planes and helicopters. In March 2007, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine created the state aircraft building concern Aviation of Ukraine (SACAU), which is governed by the Ministry of Industrial Policy. Production of An-148 aircraft is now one of the most prospective projects for the Ukrainian plane manufacturing industry with 35 units manufactured since 2009 (together with Russian production).\nThe aircraft were engineered by the Antonov Scientific and Production Complex Design Office (Antonov ANTK). The largest single airplane in the world, Antonov An-225 Mriya was designed by Antonov ANTK and made in 1988. The gross production of light and ultra light planes in Ukraine does not exceed 200 units per annum. Production of hang-gliders and paragliders of all designs makes nearly 1,000 units each year. Most of produced devices are exported. The main buyers of Ukrainian-made ultra-light aircraft are the United States, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France, etc..\nSince 2014, aerospace industry revenues have fallen by 80%. In June 2016, the Antonov Corporation merged with the state-owned military conglomerate Ukroboronprom, forming Ukrainian Aircraft Corporation within its structure. This merger was done to boost Antonov profits and the production rate. In 2018, Antonov was working on two cargo planes: the An-178, a cargo version of the An-158, and the An-132D, a redesigned version of the An-32. The An-132 was developed jointly with Saudi's Taqnia Aeronautics Company, featuring western avionics and engines. The roll out and first flight was due at the beginning of January 2017.\nThe space rocket industry in Ukraine has been managed by the State Space Agency of Ukraine since 1992. The agency included 30 enterprises, scientific research institutes, and design offices. Pivdenne Design Bureau was in general responsible for creating the Zenit-3SL carrier rocket. In 2013, The National Space Agency of Ukraine was involved in cooperation with American Rockwell Int., as well as the Sea Launch project. Yuzhnoye SDO was the designer and manufacturer of the initial first stage core of the U.S. Orbital ATK Antares rocket.\nShipbuilding.\nUkraine is one of the 10 largest shipbuilding countries in Europe. There are 49 shipbuilding companies registered in Ukraine. They are able to build a wide range of vessel types: powerboats, barges, bulk carriers (dry cargo ship), tankers, liquefied gas carriers, etc.\nThe USSR's collapse put Ukraine's shipbuilding industry into a long-term decline. This lasted until 1999 and was mostly due to a minimum volume of state shipbuilding orders. Between 1992 and 2003, Ukraine's 11 shipyards produced 237 navigation units for a total value of US$1.5\u00a0billion. Production facilities are not working near full capacity, and customers are not always timely in paying for services. The shipbuilding industry grew between 2000 and 2006, in line with the wider Ukrainian economic expansion at the time.\nState support and the opening of free economic zones, foremost at enterprises based in Mykolaiv were a crucial recent development in Ukraine's shipbuilding industry. Within the Mykolaiv Special Economic Zone, enterprises like Damen Shipyards Okean, Chornomorskyi (Black Sea) Shipbuilding Plant (defunct since 2021), 61 Communards Shipbuilding Plant, as well as the Veselka (Rainbow) paint and insulation enterprise are implementing investment projects targeted to raise efficiency and quality in primarily export-oriented vessels through production upgrades. The new engineering developments and high potential of Ukrainian designers provide the ability to build high quality vessels with competitive prices.\nAgriculture.\nAlthough typically known as the industrial base of the Soviet Union, agriculture is a large part of Ukraine's economy. Ukraine is one of the world's largest agricultural producers and exporters and is known as the \"breadbasket\" of Europe.\nIn 2008, agriculture accounted for 8.29% of Ukraine's GDP and by 2012 had grown to 10.43% of the GDP. Agriculture accounted for $13.98 billion of value added to the economy of Ukraine in 2012. Despite being a top 10 world producer of several crops such as wheat and corn Ukraine still only ranks 24 out of 112 nations measured in terms of overall agricultural production.\nIn 2011, Ukraine was the world's largest producer of sunflower oil, a major global producer of grain and sugar, and a potential global player on meat and dairy markets. It was one of the largest producers of nuts. Ukraine produced more natural honey than any other European country and was one of the world's largest honey producers. An estimated 1.5% of its population was involved in honey production, therefore Ukraine had the highest honey per capita production rate in the world. Because Ukraine possesses 30% of the world's richest black soil, makes its agricultural industry have huge potential.\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, Ukraine's agricultural industry was highly profitable, generating profit margins of 40\u201360%. Analysts indicated that the sector had the potential to increase its output by up to four times. Ukraine was the world's 6th largest, 5th if not including the EU as a separate state, producer of corn in the world and the 3rd largest corn exporter in the world. In 2012, Ukraine signed a contract with China, the world's largest importer of corn, to supply China with 3 million tonnes of corn annually at market price. The deal included a $3 billion line of credit extension from China to Ukraine.\nIn 2014, Ukraine's total grain crop was estimated to be a record 64 million metric tons. In 2014, Ukraine lost control over portions of several regions to Russia, followed by the start of the war in Donbas and the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation, hence the actual available crop yield was closer to 60.5 million metric tons. Due to the decline of the metallurgy industry, which was previously Ukraine's top export category, agricultural products have become Ukraine's largest export category as a result of the war in Donbas.\nSince at least 2011, farmland was remaining as the only major asset in Ukraine that was not privatised. In March 2020, the Ukrainian parliament lifted a ban on the sale of farmland. The land market was fully opened for the first time since independence on 1 July 2021.\nUkraine also produces some wine, mostly in the South-Western regions.\nIn 2018:\nin addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products.\nProfessionalised, scientific breeding of barley began in 1910 and now supplies improved cultivars to the country.34\nInformation technology.\nUkraine has a long-standing reputation as a major technology region, with a well-developed scientific and educational base. In March 2013, Ukraine ranked 4th in the world in number of certified IT professionals after the United States, India, and Russia. On top of that, experts recognised both the quantitative and qualitative potential of Ukrainian specialists. In 2011, the number of IT specialists working in the industry reached 25,000 people with 20% growth. The volume of the Ukrainian IT market in 2013 was estimated to be up to 3.6 billion U.S. dollars.\nIn 2017, Ukraine emerged as the top outsourcing destination of the year, according to the Global Sourcing Association. By 2017, there were 13 research and development centres of global companies located in Ukraine, including Ericsson Ukraine, in Lviv.\nAs for 2019, the number of IT specialists involved in the IT industry of Ukraine reached 172,000 people. The share of IT industry in Ukraine's GDP is 4%.\nAccording to the IT sector report of 2019, Ukraine is the largest exporter of IT services in Europe, and ranks among the 25 most attractive countries for software development worldwide.\nInfrastructure.\nMaritime.\nAbout 100,000 Ukrainians regularly work on foreign merchant ships, one of the largest group of Ukrainian labour migrants and the sixth largest number of sailors from any country. They are attracted by the high salaries of more than US$1,000 per month.\nEvery major Ukrainian coastal city has a maritime university.\nCommunications.\nUkraine ranks eighth among the world's nations in terms of the Internet speed with the average download speed of 1,190\u00a0kbit/s. Five national providers of fixed (DSL, ADSL, XDSL) internet access \u2014 Ukrtelecom, Vega Telecom, Datagroup, Ukrnet, Volia, and 3 national operators of mobile internet \u2013 Vodafone Ukraine, Kyivstar, lifecell are currently operating in Ukraine. Every regional centre and large district centre has a number of local providers and home networks.\n2011 revenues from Internet service providing in Ukraine reached \u20b44.75 billion.\nOver 16 million Ukrainians had Internet access in 2012, growing to 22 million in 2015. In Kyiv, 90% of the population had internet access.\nThe mobile-cellular telephone system's expansion has slowed, largely due to saturation of the market, which has reached 144 mobile phone subscriptions per 100 people.\nTourism.\nIn 2012, Ukraine was the 8th most popular tourism destination in Europe with 23 million visitors. The country's tourism industry is generally considered to be underdeveloped, but it does provide crucial support for Ukraine's economy. In 2012, the contribution of tourism to the GDP amounted to \u20b428.8 billion, or 2.2% of GDP and directly supported 351,500 jobs (1.7% of total employment).\nShopping tourism.\nUkraine's neighbours (Belarusians, Hungarians, Poles, Russians, and Slovaks) are known to come to Ukraine to purchase products (such as food or gasoline) and presents that are cheaper in Ukraine than in their home countries.\nRecreational tourism and sightseeing.\nUkraine has impressive landscapes, ruins of ancient castles, historical parks, vineyards where they produce native wines, unique structures such as Saint Sophia Cathedral or Chersonesos. Officially, there are seven World Heritage Sites in Ukraine. The Carpathian Mountains suitable for skiing, hiking, fishing and hunting. Bukovel \u2014 is the largest ski resort in Ukraine situated in the Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast (province) of western Ukraine. The 2010\u20132011 winter season recorded 1,200,000-day visits with foreigners amounting to 8\u201310% of all visitors. In 2012, the Bukovel was named the fastest growing ski resort worldwide. The coastline on the Black Sea is a popular summer destination for vacationers, especially Odesa.\nFinancing, banking, investments.\nInvestments.\nA political crisis in the middle of 2006 was feared as a threat to economic and investment stability, however, despite the forecasts, the political situation has not scared investors. The GDP showed a good growth rate of 7% in 2007, compared to the previous year. Industrial output has increased. Car sales have soared, while the banking sector has expanded, thanks to the arrival of European banks.\nInternational financial institutions.\nIn 1992, Ukraine became a member of the IMF and the World Bank. It is also a member of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.\nIn 2008, the country joined the World Trade Organization (WTO). Ukraine applied for WTO membership in 1993, but its accession process was stalled for 15 years.\nForeign direct investment.\nTo encourage foreign trade and investment, the Ukrainian parliament approved a foreign investment law that would allow foreigners to purchase businesses and property, to repatriate revenue and profits, and to receive compensation if the property is nationalised by a future government. Complex laws and regulations, poor corporate governance, weak enforcement of contract law by courts, and corruption, continued to prevent direct large-scale foreign investment in Ukraine. There is a functioning stock market, but portfolio investment activities have been restricted by a historic lack of protection of shareholders' rights.\nAs of April 2011, total foreign direct investment stock in Ukraine stood at $44.7 billion. Statistics from FDi Magazine show that Ukraine suffered a year on year decline in foreign direct investment between 2010 and 2013.\nState enterprise InvestUkraine was created under the State Agency for Investment and National Projects (\"National Projects\") to serve as a one-stop stop for investors and to deliver investment consulting services.\nUkraine signed a shale gas exploration deal with Royal Dutch Shell on 25 January 2013. The $10 billion deal was the largest foreign direct investment ever for Ukraine.\nMany companies, owned by foreigners, have been successfully operating in Ukraine since its independence. These include companies in agriculture, such as Kyiv-Atlantic Group, founded in 1994 by David Sweere. He sold its business in Minnesota and invested in Ukraine, believing in its huge potential. The company has been operating at a profit since 2002. As a result, he became the fifth richest among the Westerners who made their fortune in Ukraine.\nIn 2016, foreign direct investment in Ukraine's economy amounted to $3.8\u00a0billion in 2016, which was almost twice more than in 2015.\nLegal environment and economic support.\nBackground.\nSince the late 1990s, the Ukrainian government has pledged to reduce the number of government agencies, streamline the regulatory process, create a legal environment to encourage entrepreneurs, and enact a comprehensive tax overhaul. In 2003, the IMF encouraged Ukraine to quicken the pace and scope of reforms, threatening to withdraw financial support.\nOn 24 June 2010, Ukraine's Foreign Minister Kostyantyn Hryshchenko signed a free trade agreement with the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). According to the Global Competitiveness Report of 2012\u20132013, \"the country's most important challenge is the needed overhaul of its institutional framework, which cannot be relied on because it suffers from red tape, lack of transparency, and favouritism.\" In reports by the \"Kyiv Post\" in 2010 and 2011 respectively, a \"double taxation avoidance\" treaty with Cyprus signed in 1982 by the Soviet Union has cost Ukraine billions of U.S. dollars of tax revenues.\nThe 2014 campaign of lustration in Ukraine was criticised by Mark Varga, writing in \"The National Interest\" as it might have adverse economic effects. On 29 May 2014, Ukraine entered into the European Union\u2013Ukraine Association Agreement, that reached its full application on 1 September 2017.\nDual citizenship.\nIn June 2025, Ukraine legalized dual citizenship.\nForeign workers.\nA number of foreign guest workers come to work in Ukraine, mainly in seasonal farm work and construction industry, especially from neighbouring Moldova and Belarus.\nEnvironmental issues.\nUkraine is interested in cooperating on regional environmental issues. Conservation of natural resources is a stated high priority, although implementation suffers from a lack of financial resources. Ukraine established its first nature preserve, Askania-Nova, in 1921 and has programs to breed endangered species.\nUkraine has a Ministry of Environment and has introduced a pollution fee system that levies taxes on air and water emissions and solid waste disposal. The resulting revenues are channelled to environmental protection activities, but enforcement of this pollution fee system is lax. Industrial pollution remains a considerable problem in Ukraine.\nSignificant environmental problems result from the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster in 1986. In accordance with its previously announced plans, Ukraine permanently closed the Chernobyl Atomic Energy Station in December 2000. In November 2001, Ukraine withdrew an application it had made to the EBRD for funding to complete two new reactor units to compensate for the energy once produced by Chernobyl. Ukrainian concern over reform conditions attached to the loan \u2013 particularly tariff increases needed to ensure loan repayment\u2014led the Ukrainian government to withdraw the application on the day the EBRD Board was to have considered final approval.\nThe Russo-Ukrainian War significantly impacts the environmental situation. Thirty-six thousand tons of waste, including toxic chemicals such as copper and zinc, have entered water bodies, posing dangers to human organs and the nervous system. Three million hectares of forests need to be demined, and forest fires caused by shelling occur in 30% of the country's forest area. The war has released approximately 67,532,788 tons of hazardous emissions, causing respiratory and cardiovascular issues.\nUkrainian companies.\nIn 2022, the sector with the highest number of companies registered in Ukraine is Services with 512,393 companies followed by Wholesale Trade and Manufacturing with 288,072 and 93,637 companies respectively.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFacts and figures.\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\nPoverty rate: 4% in 2018 (below US$5.5/day).\nIndustrial production growth rate:\n6% (2007 est.), 6.5 (2008)\nElectricity:\nElectricity \u2013 production by source:\nOil:\nNatural gas:\nAgriculture \u2013 exports:\ngrain, sugar beets, sunflower seeds, vegetables, beef, milk, natural honey.\nAgriculture \u2013 imports:\nseafood, pork, beef, grain.\nExchange rates:\nhryvnia per US$1 \u2013 22 (2015), 7.97 (2009), 5.05 (2007), 5.05 (2006), 5.13 (2005), 5.33 (May 2004), 5.30 (October 2002), 5.59 (February 2000), 5.3811 (January 2000), 4.1304 (1999), 2.4495 (1998), 1.8617 (1997), 1.8295 (1996), 1.4731 (1995)\nMinimum wage:\n\u20b46,000/ ~$210 per month (from 2021 to 2001\u201301)\nAverage salary by region\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Unlike the country's dominating export industries, telecommunications, as well as the related Internet sector, remain largely unaffected by the global economic crisis, ranking high in European and global rankings.\nThe industry also leads in demonopolization of Ukraine's economy as Ukrtelekom (once the country's sole telephone provider) was successfully privatized, and is now losing its retail market share to independent, foreign-invested private providers.\nThe entire population of Ukraine now has telephone and/or mobile phone connection; Internet access is universally available in cities and main transport corridors, expanding into smaller settlements.\nUkraine's telecommunication development plan emphasizes further improving domestic trunk lines, international connections, and the mobile cellular system.\nDuring the Russian invasion of Ukraine, telecommunications were provided by the Starlink satellite service.\nInternational data network.\nTwo new domestic trunk lines are a part of the fibre-optic Trans-Asia-Europe (TAE) system and three Ukrainian links have been installed in the fibre-optic Trans-European Lines (TEL) project that connects 18 countries; additional international service is provided by the Italy-Turkey-Ukraine-Russia (ITUR) fibre-optic submarine cable and by earth stations in the Intelsat, Inmarsat, and Intersputnik satellite systems.\nFixed telephone network.\nTelephones - land lines in use: 12.681 million (2011)\nUpon gaining independence from the USSR in 1991, Ukraine inherited an analogue PSTN telephone system that was antiquated, inefficient, and in many places in disrepair; meanwhile demand overwhelmed the supply with more than 3.5 million households applications for telephone lines pending. Telephone density has since risen and the domestic trunk system is being improved; about one-third of Ukraine's networks are digital, and the majority of regional centres now have digital switching stations. Improvements in local networks and local exchanges continue to lag.\nSeveral independent fixed network providers established themselves in the country's retail market, although Ukrtelecom still dominates it.\nMobile phone networks.\nMarket penetration.\nThe mobile cellular telephone system's expansion has slowed, largely due to the saturation of the market, which has reached 125 mobile phones per 100 people.\nTelephones - mobile cellular: 55.578 million (2011)\nMobile phone manufacturers.\nThe following companies in Ukraine are manufacturing mobile phones:\nRadio broadcast stations.\n300 (2007)\nUkrainian Amateur Radio League\nHistory.\nRussian Invasion of Ukraine.\nUkraine's military and government rapidly became dependent on SpaceX's Starlink satellite services during Russian's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, as Russia attacked key infrastructures including telecommunication ones, and Ukraine was experiencing significant problems with Internet access.\nSatellite internet from SpaceX had key telecommunications role such as in the Siege of Azovstal (April 15\u2013May 20), which helped Ukrainian defenders to resist Russian troops in Mariupol.\nWhile military and government use of Starlink has been the most important aspect of opening Ukraine to low-altitude satellite internet services in early 2022, civilians are also heavily using the technology \"to keep in touch with the outside world and tell loved ones that they are alive.\" During the war, Ukrainians can use Starlink terminals without paying the usual monthly subscription fee.\nTo pay for the cost of Starlink in Ukraine, SpaceX donated for an estimate of over $100 million, while an unknown amount was secured by several European countries and the US government. In June 2023, The Pentagon communicated that the Department of Defense signed a contract with SpaceX's Starlink to buy those satellite services for Ukraine.\nThe use of Starlink in Russian-occupied territories in Ukraine was however restricted by SpaceX, according to Ukrainian officials.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The transportation sector accounts for roughly 11% of the country's gross domestic product and 7% of total employment.\nIn total, Ukrainian paved roads stretch for . Major routes, marked with the letter 'M' for 'International' (Ukrainian: \"\u041c\u0456\u0436\u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0439\"), extend nationwide and connect all major cities of Ukraine, and provide cross-border routes to the country's neighbours.\nInternational maritime travel is mainly provided through the Port of Odesa, from where ferries sail regularly to Istanbul, Varna and Haifa. The largest ferry company presently operating these routes is Ukrferry.\nRail transport in Ukraine connects all major urban areas, port facilities and industrial centres with neighbouring countries. The heaviest concentration of railway track is the Donbas region of Ukraine. Although rail freight transport fell in the 1990s, Ukraine is still one of the world's highest rail users.\nThe total amount of railroad track in Ukraine extends for , of which was electrified in the 2000s. The state has a monopoly on the provision of passenger rail transport, and all trains, other than those with cooperation of other foreign companies on international routes, are operated by its company Ukrzaliznytsia.\nKyiv Boryspil is Ukraine's largest international airport. It has three main passenger terminals and is the base for the country's flag carrier, Ukraine International Airlines. Other large airports in the country include those in Kharkiv, Lviv and Donetsk (now destroyed). In addition to its flag carrier, Ukraine has a number of airlines including Windrose Airlines, Dniproavia, Azur Air Ukraine, and AtlasGlobal Ukraine. Antonov Airlines, a subsidiary of the Antonov Aerospace Design Bureau, was the only operator of the world's largest fixed wing aircraft, the An-225.\nEconomy.\nTransport infrastructure.\nToday the transport sector in Ukraine generally meets only the basic needs of the economy and population. The level of safety, quality and efficiency of passenger and freight transport, as well as the infrastructure's amount of energy usage, and the technological burden it places on the environment do not meet modern-day requirements.\nDue to the low level of demand, the country's existing transit potential and advantageous geographical position is not fully utilised. There is thus a lag in the development of transport infrastructure, transport and logistics technologies and multimodal transport. All this has made Ukraine uncompetitive as the high costs of transport across the country make the cost of production in the country uncommonly high.\nInternational transport corridors.\nThe advantageous geographical position of Ukraine allows for the location of a number of International Transport Corridors on its territory, in particular :\nTransport industry.\nThe share of the transport sector in Ukraine's gross domestic product (according to statista) as of 2021 was 5.42%. The number of workers employed in the sector is 8% of total employment. The transportation infrastructure of Ukraine is adequately developed overall, however it is obsolete and in need of major modernization. A remarkable boost in the recent development of the country's transportation infrastructure was noticed after winning the right to host a major continental sport event the UEFA Euro 2012.\nIn 2009, Ukrainian infrastructure provided for the transportation of 1.5 billion tons of cargo and 7.3 billion passengers. Due to the 2008 financial crisis, the volume of freight traffic decreased by 17.6% in 2009 when compared with figures from 2008; passenger transport fell by 12.7%.\nFreight and Passenger Transportation Statistics\nRail.\nThe public railways in Ukraine are managed by the state railway company Ukrzaliznytsia.\nNetwork length (2010).\nThe length of the railway network Ukraine ranks third in Europe (21.700 kilometres of track).\nMetro.\nIn Ukraine, there are 4 metro systems: the Kyiv Metro, the Kharkiv Metro, the Dnipro Metro and the Kryvyi Rih Metro.\nRoads.\nThe development of public roads in Ukraine is currently lagging behind the pace of motorisation in the country. During 1990-2010 the length of the highways network hardly increased at all. The density of highways in Ukraine is 6.6 times lower than in France (respectively 0.28 and 1.84 kilometres of roads per square kilometre area of the country). The length of express roads in Ukraine is 0.28 thousand km (in Germany \u2013 12.5 thousand kilometres in France \u2013 7.1 thousand kilometres), and the level of funding for each kilometre of road in Ukraine is around 5.5 \u2013 6 times less than in those locations.\nThis is due to a number of objective reasons, including that the burden of maintaining the transport network per capita is significantly higher than in European countries because of Ukraine's relatively low population density (76 people per square kilometre), low purchasing power of citizens (1/5 of the Eurozone's purchasing capacity), relatively low car ownership and the nation's large territory.\nThe operational condition of roads is very poor; around 51.1% of roads do not meet minimum standards, and 39.2% require major rebuilds. The average speed on roads in Ukraine 2\u20133 times lower than in Western countries.\nAs of 2016, many of Ukraine's major provincial highways are in very poor condition, with an Ukravtodor official stating that 97% of roads are in need of repair. The road repair budget was set at about \u20b420 billion, but corruption causes the budget to be poorly spent and overweight trucks are common place rapidly causing more road damage.\nPrincipal roads.\n Motorways in Ukraine, (2010):\nKyiv \u2013 Boryspil | Kharkiv \u2013 Dnipro\n State Highways, (2009):&lt;br&gt;\nM01 | M02 | M03 | M04 |\nM05 | M06 | M07 | M08 | M09 | M10 | M11 | M12 | M13 | M14 | M15 | M16 | M17 | M18 | M19 | M20 | M21 | M22 | M23\nNote: \"State highways are important national routes and are not necessarily high-speed roads\"\nAviation.\nOutlook.\nThe aviation section in Ukraine is developing very quickly, having recently established a visa-free program for EU nationals and citizens of a number of other 'Western' nations, the nation's aviation sector is handling a significantly increased number of travellers. Additionally, the granting of the Euro 2012 football tournament to Poland and Ukraine as joint hosts has prompted the government to invest huge amounts of money into transport infrastructure, and in particular airports.\nCurrently there are three major new airport terminals under construction in Donetsk, Lviv and Kyiv, a new terminal has already opened in Kharkiv and Kyiv's Boryspil International Airport has recently begun operations at Terminal F, the first of its two new international terminals. Ukraine has a number of airlines, the largest of which is the nation's flag carrier, UIA. Antonov Airlines, a subsidiary of the Antonov Aerospace Design Bureau is the only operator of the world's largest fixed wing aircraft, the An-225.\nDonetsk Airport destroyed due to War in Donbass.\nNew terminal at Odesa International Airport has been opened for arrival flights on April 14, 2017.\nAirports.\nAirports with paved runways.\nMajor airports are: Kyiv Boryspil Airport, Dnipro International Airport, Kharkiv Airport, Lviv Airport, Donetsk Airport, Odesa Airport, and Simferopol Airport.\nWater transport.\nRiver transport.\n navigable waterways on 7 rivers, most of them are on Danube, Dnieper and Pripyat rivers.

The foreign relations of Ukraine are guided by a number of key priorities outlined in the foreign policy of Ukraine.\nWestern relations.\nUkraine considers Euro-Atlantic integration its primary foreign policy objective, but in practice balances its relationship with Europe and the United States while attempting to sever its considerable ties to Russia. The European Union's Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) with Ukraine went into force on March 1, 1998. The European Union (EU) has encouraged Ukraine to implement the PCA fully before discussions begin on an association agreement. The EU Common Strategy toward Ukraine, issued at the EU Summit in December 1999 in Helsinki, recognizes Ukraine's long-term aspirations but does not discuss association.\nOn January 31, 1992, Ukraine joined the then-Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (now the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\u2014OSCE), and on March 10, 1992, it became a member of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council. Ukraine also has a close relationship with NATO and has declared interest in eventual membership. It is the most active member of the Partnership for Peace (PfP). Former President Viktor Yushchenko indicated that he supports Ukraine joining the EU in the future. Plans for Ukrainian membership to NATO were shelved by Ukraine following the 2010 Ukrainian presidential election in which Viktor Yanukovych was elected President.\nYanukovych opted to keep Ukraine a non-aligned state. This materialized on June 3, 2010 when the Ukrainian parliament (Verkhovna Rada) excluded, with 226 votes, the goal of \"integration into Euro-Atlantic security and NATO membership\" from the country's national security strategy giving the country a non-aligned status. \"European integration\" has remained part of Ukraine's national security strategy and co-operation with NATO was not excluded.\nUkraine then considered relations with NATO as a partnership. Ukraine and NATO continued to hold joint seminars and joint tactical and strategical exercises. After February 2014's Yanukovych ouster and the Russian annexation of Crimea, the nation has renewed its drive for NATO membership. On 23 December 2014 the Verkhovna Rada abolished, with 303 votes, Ukraine's non-aligned status.\nOn July 30, 2014, the US Senate passed a bill that gives Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova the status of non\u2013NATO allies. Now, in the event of direct military aggression against these countries, the United States can bring its troops into these countries to protect them from external aggression.\nBilateral security agreements.\nIn early 2024, following the 24 February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, a number of allies of Ukraine signed long-term bilateral security treaties with Ukraine for many years to come (often a period of 10 years). They resulted from a declaration by the G7 countries at a NATO Summit in Washington on 12 July 2023, concluding the establishment of a framework of bilateral security agreements of long-term military, materiel and economic support for Ukraine's defence.\n The bilateral agreements prioritised strengthening Ukrainian air defence systems, artillery, long-range strike capabilities, armour, and combat aviation to fend off Russian military aggression.\nAs of 2025, Slovakia and South Korea is negotiating long-term bilateral security agreements with Ukraine. 30 countries as well as the European Union had signed bilateral security treaties with Ukraine.\nRelations with CIS states.\nUkraine's relations with Russia had been complicated by energy dependence and by payment arrears. However, relations improved with the 1998 ratification of the bilateral Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation. The two sides have signed a series of agreements on the final division and disposition of the former Soviet Black Sea Fleet that helped to reduce tensions. However, Ukraine cut diplomatic relations with Russia as a response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nUkraine became a (non-official) member of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) on December 8, 1991. In January 1993 it refused to endorse a draft charter strengthening political, economic, and defense ties among CIS members, and completely ceased to participate as a member in March 2014. Ukraine was a founding member of GUAM (Georgia-Ukraine-Azerbaijan-Moldova).\nIn 1999\u20132001, Ukraine served as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council. Soviet Ukraine joined the United Nations in 1945 as one of the original members following a Western compromise with the Soviet Union, which had asked for seats for all 15 of its union republics. Ukraine has consistently supported peaceful, negotiated settlements to disputes. It has participated in the quadripartite talks on the conflict in Moldova and promoted a peaceful resolution to conflict in the post-Soviet state of Georgia.\nLeonid Derkach (chairman of the SBU, which is Ukraine's security service, successor to the KGB) was fired due to Western pressure after he organized the sale of radar systems to Iraq while such sales were embargoed.\nInternational disputes.\nBelarus.\nThe 1997 boundary treaty with Belarus remains un-ratified due to unresolved financial claims, stalling demarcation and reducing border security.\nRussia.\nDelimitation of the land boundary with Russia is incomplete, but the parties have agreed to defer demarcation. The maritime boundary through the Sea of Azov and the Kerch Strait remains unresolved despite a December 2003 framework agreement and ongoing expert-level discussions. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin allegedly declared at a NATO-Russia summit in 2008 that if Ukraine would join NATO his country can contend to annex the Ukrainian East and Crimea. As of April 2024, Russia has annexed the Crimean peninsula and partly four other regions of Ukraine: Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.\nStarting in November 2013, the decision by Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych to back out of signing an integration agreement with the European Union started a period of civil unrest between Ukrainians who favored integration with the European Union and those who wanted closer ties with Russia. This culminated in the Revolution of Dignity. Russia took advantage of this political instability to annex Crimea in March 2014, though Ukraine still claims sovereignty over the territory by any kind of international law. Russia has also allegedly supported quasi-separatist forces in the war in Donbas. In December 2015 Russian hackers reportedly hacked Ukraine's power grids leading to a blackout and widespread terror.\nOn 24 February 2022, diplomatic relations were cut with Russia as a response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nMoldova.\nMoldova and Ukraine have established joint customs posts to monitor transit through Moldova's break-away Transnistria Region which remains under OSCE supervision.\nRomania.\nUkraine and Romania have settled their dispute over the Ukrainian-administered Zmiyinyy (Snake) Island and the Black Sea maritime boundary at the International Court of Justice. The 2010 CIA World Factbook states that \"Romania opposes Ukraine's reopening of a navigation canal from the Danube border through Ukraine to the Black Sea\".\nInvestment promotion.\nState enterprise InvestUkraine was created under the State Agency for Investment and National Projects (National Projects) to serve as a One Stop Shop for investors and to deliver investment consulting services.\nDual Citizenship.\nIn June 2025, Ukraine legalized multiple citizenship.\nRelations by country.\nEurope.\nUkraine and all UN member states in Europe, except Belarus and Kazakhstan, are members of the Council of Europe.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31834", "revid": "13286072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31834", "title": "History of the United Arab Emirates", "text": "The United Arab Emirates (the UAE or the Emirates) is a country in the eastern part of the Arabian Peninsula, located on the southeastern coast of the Persian Gulf and the northwestern coast of the Gulf of Oman. The UAE has a history of human habitation, transmigration and trade spanning over 125,000 years. Pastoralist, nomadic Neolithic communities thrived in the area until the 4th millennium BCE. The area was home to the Bronze Age Magan people, known to the Sumerians, who traded with the Harappan culture of the Indus Valley, Afghanistan and Bactria, and the Levant.\nThrough the three defined Iron Ages and the subsequent Hellenistic period, the area was an important coastal trading entrep\u00f4t. It was Islamised in the 7th century, when it again emerged as an important centre for trade, particularly around the ports of Julfar, Dibba and Khor Fakkan. Linked to the Eastern Arab trading network that centred around the Kingdom of Hormuz, they formed an important link in the Arab monopoly of trade between the East and Europe.\nThe Portuguese under Afonso de Albuquerque invaded the area and disrupted the Arab trade networks, triggering a decline in trade and a rise in regional conflict. Conflicts between the maritime communities of the Trucial Coast and the British led to the sacking of Ras Al Khaimah by British forces, which resulted in the first of several British treaties with the coastal rulers in 1820 (leading to the adoption of the name the Trucial States) and their status as a British protectorate. An early-1968 British decision to withdraw from its involvement in the Trucial States led to the decision to form a federation between two of the most influential Trucial rulers, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan of Abu Dhabi and Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum of Dubai, who shook hands on 18 February 1968 in a desert tent between their emirates. They met with the rulers of the other five Trucial States and Bahrain and Qatar to discuss a federation on 25 February, and in a 27 February joint announcement named the intended federation the Federation of the Arab Emirates.\nThe United Arab Emirates achieved independence from Britain on 2 December 1971. Six of the seven emirates (Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al Quwain and Fujairah) declared their union that day and the seventh, Ras Al Khaimah, joined the federation on 10 February 1972.\nPrehistory.\nIn 2011, archeologists excavated primitive hand-axes and several kinds of scrapers and perforators at the Jebel Faya site. These objects resemble the tools used by early modern humans in East Africa. According to thermoluminescence dating, the artefacts are 125,000 years old. This is some of the earliest evidence of modern humans outside Africa, indicating that they left Africa much earlier than previously thought. The site has been preserved with discoveries related to later cultures, including tombs and other finds from the Hafit, Umm Al Nar, Wadi Suq, Iron Age, Hellenistic and Islamic periods, at Sharjah's Mleiha Archaeological Centre.\nNeolithic.\nEastern Arabia is thought to have been uninhabitable during the glacial maximum period, from 68,000 to 8000 BCE. Finds from the Stone Age Arabian Bifacial and Ubaid cultures (including knapped stone arrow and axe heads and Ubaid pottery) are evidence of human habitation in the area from 5000 to 3100 BCE, and demonstrate a cultural linkage between the human settlements of the Gulf and those of Mesopotamia. The inland necropolis at Jebel Buhais in Sharjah is the oldest burial site in the Emirates, with burials as old as the 5th millennium BCE. The archaeological record indicates that the Neolithic Arabian Bifacial/Ubaid period abruptly ended in eastern Arabia and the Oman peninsula at 3800 BCE, just after the lake lowering and dune reactivation onset; this devastated the area west of the Hajar Mountains, leading to the Dark Millennium: a fallow piece of the archaeological record, probably triggered by climate change and covering much of the period between 4000 and 3200 BCE. In the Baynunah Formation of the western Emirate of Abu Dhabi, a camel-slaughter site has been discovered which dates to about 6,000 years ago.\nHafit period.\nThe Hafit period followed the Dark Millennium as the re-emergence of human habitation on the western coast of Emirati. The Hafit period was named after many finds of burials of distinctive beehive-shaped tombs in the mountainous area of Jebel Hafeet in Al Ain Region. Further links to Mesopotamia are evidenced by finds of Jemdet Nasr pottery. The period defines early Bronze Age human settlement in the United Arab Emirates and Oman as from 3,200 to 2,600 BCE. Hafit-period tombs and remains have also been found across the UAE and Oman at sites such as Bidaa Bint Saud, Jebel Buhais and Buraimi.\nBronze Age: Umm Al Nar and Wadi Suq cultures.\nUmm Al Nar (also known as Umm an-Nar) was a Bronze Age culture loosely defined by archaeologists as from around 2600 to 2000 BCE in the area of the present-day UAE and Oman. The etymology derives from the island of the same name, which is adjacent to Abu Dhabi. The key site is well-protected and its location, between a refinery and a sensitive military area, have restricted public access.\nA characteristic element of the Umm Al Nar culture is circular tombs, typically with well-fitted stones in the outer wall and multiple human remains within. The Umm Al Nar culture covers six centuries (2600-2000 BCE), with further evidence of trade with the Sumerian and Akkadian kingdoms and the Indus Valley. The increasing sophistication of the Umm Al Nar people included the domestication of animals.\nIt was followed by the Wadi Suq culture, which dominated the region from 2000 to 1300 BCE. Key archaeological sites, pointing to major trading cities extant during both periods, are located on the western and eastern coasts of the UAE and in Oman and include Dalma, Umm Al Nar, Sufouh, Ed Dur, Tell Abraq and Kalba. Burial sites at Shimal and Seih Al Harf in Ras Al Khaimah have evidence of transitional Umm Al Nar to Wadi Suq burials.\nCamels and other animals were domesticated during the Wadi Suq era (2000-1300 BCE), leading to increased inland settlement and the cultivation of diverse crops which included the date palm. Increasingly-sophisticated metallurgy, pottery and stone carving led to more sophisticated weaponry and other implements, providing evidence that trading links with the Indus Valley and Mesopotamia dwindled.\nIron Age.\nThroughout three Iron Ages (Iron Age I, 1200-1000 BCE; Iron Age II, 1000-600 BCE; and Iron Age III, 600-300 BCE) and the Hellenistic Mleiha period (after 300 BCE), Eastern Arabia was occupied by a number of forces (including the Achaemenid Empire) and marked by the construction of fortified settlements and extensive husbandry due to the development of the \"falaj\" irrigation system. Early finds of \"aflaj\", particularly those around the desert city of Al Ain, have been cited as the earliest evidence of these waterways. The UAE have an unusual richness of archeological finds, particularly the metallurgical centre of Saruq Al Hadid in present-day Dubai. Other important Iron Age settlements in the UAE include Al Thuqeibah, Bidaa bint Saud, Ed Dur, Muweilah and Tell Abraq.\nMleiha.\nThe archaeological remnants of the Mleiha Archaeological Centre, dated to 300 BCE, are the most complete evidence of human settlement and community from the post-Iron Age era in the UAE. It documents early iron use, including nails, long swords and arrowheads, and evidence of slag from smelting. The period from 300 to 0 BCE has been called the Mleiha period, the Late Pre-Islamic period (PIR) and, according to older references, the Hellenistic era; Alexander the Great's conquests went no further than Persia, however, and left Arabia untouched.\nMleiha is linked to the ancient Near Eastern city of Ed Dur, on the UAE west coast. Hundreds of Macedonian-style coins were found at Ed Dur and Mleiha which date to Alexander the Great. They feature a head of Heracles and a seated Zeus on the obverse, and bear the name of \"Abi'el\" in Aramaic. These coins match the moulds found at Mleiha, which (with finds of Mleiha slag) suggest the existence of a metallurgical centre in the Mleiha Archaeological Centre and indicate a link between the Mleiha and Ed Dur. Camels buried with their heads reversed are also a common feature of animal burials at Ed Dur and inland Mleiha.\nIn February 2021, a trove of 409 Hellenistic-era coins stored in a clay pot was unearthed at Mleiha. The Sharjah Archaeology Authority described the nine-kilo find as \"hugely significant\". Funerary inscriptions from the mid-3rd century BCE mention the presence of \"Uman\", a major kingdom in Mleiha; the kingdom is mentioned by Greek writers Pliny the Elder and Strabo as Omana. The Mleiha site was apparently abandoned after the 3rd century CE, marking the kingdom's fall.\nEarly Christian presence.\nArchaeology has revealed late-antique and early Islamic Christian communities in the present-day UAE, linked to the Church of the East in the Beth Qa\u1e6draye region along the coast. On Sir Bani Yas (Abu Dhabi), a monastery and church were first identified in 1992; subsequent study established the site's monastic character, and a 2025 excavation uncovered a molded-plaster cross in adjacent courtyard houses (indicating a broader monastic settlement). A second monastery was identified on Siniyah Island (Umm al-Quwain) with radiocarbon dates from 534 to 656 CE, representing part of a cluster of Gulf Christian sites contemporary with the emergence of Islam.\nAdvent of Islam and the Middle Ages.\nThe Tuwwam region has long been held to have been related to the Buraimi settlement as a result of mentions in literature by Muqaddasi and others. However, contemporary research has tentatively identified Siniyah Island in Umm Al Quwain as the centre of the ancient lost town and region of Tawwam (or Tu'am); the name \"Tu'am\" is derived from St Thomas the Apostle of the East. Siniyah is the site of a major Christian monastic complex and the oldest pearling town in the Gulf. Siniyah is one of six monasteries identified on the Persian Gulf coast, and its discovery follows that of a pre-Islamic monastic centre on Abu Dhabi's Sir Bani Yas island.\nThe arrival of envoys from Muhammad in 632 heralded the region's conversion to Islam. A major battle of the Ridda Wars was fought after Muhammad's death at Dibba, on the east coast of the present-day Emirates. The defeat of the non-Muslims, including Laqit bin Malik Al-Azdi, resulted in the triumph of Islam in the Arabian Peninsula.\nThe Islamic era saw the expansion of trading links to the East, with trade centred around Hormuz Island and its port of Julfar. The medieval port was settled in two halves in the present-day Ras Al Khaimah suburbs of Al Mataf and Al Nudud from the 13th to 17th centuries CE. Julfar's founding has been dated to the early to mid-14th century as a small settlement of palm-frond huts which expanded during the 15th and 16th centuries into an important trading town. Julfar's early population fished and probably pearled; they also farmed, benefiting from the access to land and sea which characterised Kush, Julfar's predecessor settlement. Evidence of occupation at Julfar include finds of 14th-century Chinese porcelain, followed by post holes and ovens and the development of mud-brick buildings, defined streets and courtyard houses as the town developed into the 15th century.\nPearling and the Portuguese empire: 16th\u201318th centuries.\nPearling drove the economy of coastal communities across Eastern Arabia, which thrived in the relative calm at sea. Two to three thousand local ships were involved in the seasonal extraction of pearls from communities across the Gulf, and annual income was over half a million Portuguese cruzados. Workers in Julfar and surrounding areas were paid in pearls instead of cash. About 4,500 pearl boats operated from Gulf ports in 1907, employing over 74,000 people.\nWestern coast.\nThe most prominent pearling centers extended from Bida (Doha) to Dubai. The main part of the pearling season was around Dalma island, and was referred to as \"al-ghaws al-kabir\" (, \"the Great Dive\"). The large increase in demand from the expanding Indian and European markets led to the exploitation of more distant banks, such as the areas around Abu Dhabi and Dubai. The growth of the international merchant network turned pearling into an integrated industry enforced by local rulers. Pearling fleets remained at sea from June to late September, and every able-bodied male joined the fleet. Pearling was 80 percent of Sheikh Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan's revenue, giving him great influence and allowing him to distribute largesse.\nNorthern and Persian coasts.\nAfter the Portuguese Empire occupied Hormuz island and the northern and Persian coasts and took over the taxation system, the Sultan of Hormuz was responsible for collecting pearling taxes (\"magumbayas\") from 1523 to 1622 and Portugal obtained revenue from the industry until the second decade of the 18th century. The Portuguese system issued navigation permits (\"cartazes\"); permit distribution and tax collection were centered in the ports extending from Julfar to Khasab. On the Persian coast, the Portuguese did the same with the Arabs from Bandar Kong to the southwest coast of Iran. Any ship sailing without a Portuguese license was subject to capture by the Portuguese Armada. Fear of armada cannons led to maritime control of the Arabian coast.\nPearling culture.\nAt the start of the pearling season, which lasted from June to September, thousands of ships gathered with provisions for three months and a starting day would be set. On that day, celebrations were held and religious rites observed; this included the traditional charming of sharks so they would not harm the divers. The ships then dispersed on a clear, windless day, when the sea was calm.\nEach ship carried divers, who dove to the sea floor to gather pearls. To reach the bottom, two heavy stones were tied to the diver's feet and a cord to his waist; the cord was held by those who would pull him out. When his bag of pearls was full, the diver signalled to be pulled out.\nDecline of the industry.\nThe initial explanation of the decline of the Gulf pearling industry and the economy of the Trucial Coast, derived from two entries in the 1929 and 1930 British Residency Monthly Report by Hugh Biscoe (a newly-arrived administrator with experience in India and none in the Gulf), cited two factors: the invention of the cultured pearl by Japanese entrepreneur Kokichi Mikimoto and the Great Depression of 1929. Contemporary research indicates that overfishing, regional and world wars, poor weather and mounting debt sent the industry into decline about 20 years before Biscoe's memo, with reports of consistently poor harvests and depressed markets since 1911. The industry was already beyond recovery by the time of Biscoe's reports; the Great Depression and cultured pearls played no role in its decline. The Japanese cultured pearl, initially regarded as a wonder and displayed at expositions, began to be produced in commercial quantities during the late 1920s. However, the damage had already been done: in 1907, 335 pearling boats operated out of Dubai; in 1929, only 60 boats remained in port during the season.\nThe complex system of finance that underpinned the pearling industry and the relationships among owners, pearl merchants, \"nakhudas\" (captains), divers and pullers fell apart, leaving a large number of men unemployed. The pearling industry used slave labour; a record number of slaves approached the British Agent seeking manumission during the 1930s, reflecting the parlous state of the pearling fleet and its owners.\nBritish empire: 19th and 20th centuries.\nOttoman attempts to expand their sphere of influence into the Indian Ocean failed, and Portuguese expansion into the Indian Ocean in the early 16th century (following Vasco da Gama's route) resulted in the sacking of many coastal towns by the Portuguese. After this conflict, the Al Qasimi\u00a0\u2013 a seafaring tribe based on the Northern Peninsula and Lingeh on the Iranian coast\u00a0\u2013 dominated the Southern Gulf until the arrival of British ships.\nThe region was known to the British as the \"Pirate Coast\", with Al Qasimi (known as \"Joasmee\") raiders harassing the shipping industry despite (or perhaps because of) British navy patrols in the area during the 18th and 19th centuries. A number of conflicts occurred between 1809 and 1819.\nPersian Gulf campaign of 1809.\nAn expeditionary force embarked for Ras Al Khaimah in 1809, beginning the Persian Gulf campaign of 1809 after years of tension between the British and Al Qasimi navies; the first incidents occurred under the rule of Saqr bin Rashid Al Qasimi in 1797. The campaign ended with a peace treaty between the British and Hassan bin Rahma Al Qasimi, the Al Qasimi leader, which broke down in 1815. British diplomat J. G. Lorimer wrote that after the dissolution of the treaty, the Al Qasimi \"indulged in a carnival of maritime lawlessness, to which even their own previous record presented no parallel\".\nAfter another year of recurring attacks, Hassan bin Rahmah made conciliatory overtures to Bombay at the end of 1818 which were \"sternly rejected\". Naval resources commanded by the Al Qasimi were estimated at 60 large boats headquartered in Ras Al Khaimah, carrying 80 to 300 men each, and 40 smaller vessels housed in nearby ports.\nPersian Gulf campaign of 1819 and General Maritime Treaty of 1820.\nThe British began an expedition against the Al Qasimi in November 1819, besieging Ras Al Khaimah with a platoon of 3,000 soldiers led by Major General William Keir Grant and supported by a number of warships which included the HMS \"Liverpool\" and \"Curlew\". They extended an offer to Said bin Sultan of Muscat to make him ruler of the Pirate Coast if he agreed to assist the British in their expedition, and he obliged with a force of 600 men and two ships.\nWith the fall of Ras Al Khaimah and the surrender of Dhayah Fort, the British established a garrison of 800 sepoys and artillery in Ras Al Khaimah. Jazirat Al Hamra, south of Rad Al Khaimah, was found to be deserted. The British destroyed the fortifications and larger vessels in Umm Al Qawain, Ajman, Fasht, Sharjah, Abu Hail, and Dubai; ten vessels which had taken shelter in Bahrain were also destroyed. After the expedition, the British and the sheikhs of the coastal communities signed the General Maritime Treaty of 1820.\nThe 1820 treaty was followed by the 1847 \"Engagement to Prohibit Exportation of Slaves From Africa on board of Vessels Belonging to Bahrain and to the Trucial States and the Allow Right of Search of April\u2013May 1847\". The signatory sheikhs, now expanded by conquering smaller neighbours, included Sheikh Sultan bin Saqr of Ras Al Khaimah, Sheikh Hasher bin Maktoum of Dubai, Sheikh Abdulaziz bin Rashid of Ajman, Sheikh Abdullah bin Rashid of Umm Al Quwain and Sheikh Saeed bin Tahnoun of Abu Dhabi.\nThe treaty, granting protection to British vessels, did not prevent coastal wars between tribes. Intermittent raids continued until 1835, when the sheikhs agreed not to engage in hostilities at sea for one year; the truce was renewed annually until 1853.\nPerpetual Maritime Truce.\nThe Perpetual Maritime Truce, signed on 4 May 1853, prohibited any act of aggression at sea. The signatories included Abdulla bin Rashid of Umm Al Quwain, Hamed bin Rashid of Ajman, Saeed bin Butti of Dubai, Saeed bin Tahnoun (\"Chief of the Beniyas\") and Sultan bin Saqr (\"Chief of the Joasmees\"). A further agreement suppressing the slave trade was signed in 1856, followed by the \"Additional Article to the Maritime Truce Providing for the Protection of the Telegraph Line and Stations, Dated 1864\". An agreement about the treatment of absconding debtors followed in June 1879.\nExclusive Agreement.\nSigned in March 1892, the Exclusive Agreement bound rulers not to enter into \"any agreement or correspondence with any Power other than the British Government\"; without British assent, they would not \"consent to the residence within my territory of the agent of any other government\" and would not \"cede, sell, mortgage or otherwise give for occupation any part of my territory, save to the British Government\". In return, the British promised to protect the Trucial Coast from hostile activity on land and sea.\nTrucial States affairs.\nIn accordance with the treaties, the Trucial rulers were independent to manage their internal affairs. They often asked the British to provide naval firepower for their frequent disputes, particularly when the disputes involved indebtedness to British and Indian nationals.\nDuring the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a number of changes occurred to the status of emirates. Emirates such as Rams and Dayah (now part of Ras Al Khaimah) were signatories to the original 1819 treaty, but were not recognised by the British as trucial states; the emirate of Fujairah, today one of the seven United Arab Emirates, was not recognised as a trucial state until 1952. Kalba, recognised as a trucial state by the British in 1936, is part of the present-day emirate of Sharjah.\nUntil the 1930s, the British refrained from interfering in the internal affairs of the Trucial sheikhdoms as long as peace was maintained. This contrasted with their policy in Oman, where the British supported the stability of Oman's sultanate and maintained their airbase on Masirah Island. According to a British official,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;They could fight each other as much as they liked by land, and we did not hesitate to recognize a ruler who had acquired power by murder. The construction of an airport at Sharjah and the grant of oil concessions to an oil company forced us to modify this policy to some extent.\nDiscovery of oil.\nDuring the 1930s, the first oil company teams carried out preliminary surveys. An onshore concession was granted to Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) in 1939, and an offshore concession to D'Arcy Exploration Ltd in 1952. Exploration concessions were limited to British companies in accordance with agreements between the trucial sheikhs and British government. Management of the Trucial Coast moved from the British government in Bombay to the Foreign Office in London in 1947 with Indian independence. The Political Resident in the Gulf headed the small team responsible for liaison with the trucial sheikhs; he was based in Bushire until 1946, when his office was moved to Bahrain. Day-to-day administration was carried out by the Native Agent, a post established with the 1820 treaty and abolished in 1949. This agent was bolstered by a British political officer, based in Sharjah, in 1937.\nOil was discovered under Umm Shaif (an old pearling bed in the Persian Gulf) in 1958, and in the desert at Murban in 1960. The first cargo of crude was exported from Jabel Dhanna in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi in 1962. As the emirate's oil revenue increased, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan built schools, housing, hospitals and roads. When Dubai began exporting oil in 1969, Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum also used oil revenue to improve his people's quality of life.\nWorld War II and aftermath.\nBritish administrators in the Trucial States were particularly sensitive to criticism during the early part of the war, particularly into 1940 when things were going badly in Europe; an Indian trading company\u2019s agent was deported to India for expressing pro-German sentiment that year. The ruler of Sharjah turned up the volume of his radio and played German Arabic-language broadcasts for the benefit of an increasingly-large crowd gathering nightly to hear the broadcasts, a practice which was stopped by the horrified British Residency Agent. Rumours in the souk about British and French failure were found to have been started by Abdullah bin Faris, the ruler's secretary, and a war of words followed between Faris' supporters and British authorities; Faris was \"kept under observation\". British military activity increased at the aerodrome and RAF station at Sharjah, at the RAF landing strip and refuelling depot on Sir Bani Yas Island in Abu Dhabi, and at smaller facilities in Kalba and Ras Al Khaimah.\nA Handley Page HP42 biplane en route from India to Sharjah in the Gulf of Oman was lost in March 1940, and a Wellington bomber was lost in February 1943 at Dhadna in Fujairah. A monument to the crash and the death of the Wellington\u2019s navigator stands at Dhadna, on the east coast. Three Blenheims crashed in 1942 and 1943; one was due to engine failure in Umm Al Quwain, and one ditched in shallow water off Sharjah. One was fatal, with the loss of the pilot and two crew members of a Blenheim that lost an engine as it took off from Sharjah over the desert on 1 February 1942.\nThe war at sea included the August 1944 sinking off the coast of Oman by the German U-boat \"U859\" of the American Liberty Ship \"John Barry\", which was carrying silver ingots destined for Russia. The first sinking of a submarine in the area was the 1940 attack on the Italian submarine \"Luigi Galvani\", with the loss of 26 of its crew, after papers relating to its voyage were taken from the surrender of another Italian submarine. Thirty-one crew memberswere picked up by British ships. The German U-Boat \"U533\" was sunk off the coast of Fujairah by a Blenheim flying out of Sharjah. A single survivor from the U-boat was interned in Sharjah for the duration of the war.\nDuring the war, rationing and identity cards were introduced; commodities such as tea and sugar became valuable rarities. Opportunistic traders in Dubai smuggled and traded contraband and engaged in gunrunning. Outbreaks of disease were frequent, including outbreaks of cholera. Swarms of locusts\u00a0\u2013 considered edible by the locals\u00a0\u2013 were frequent, although a British eradication program (involving celebrated explorer Wilfred Thesiger) was successful.\nAn internal conflict broke out in the Trucial States when Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum led a party of men to build a pair of watchtowers overlooking the entrance to the creek in the coastal area of Khor Ghanadah, south of Dubai, on 17 October 1945. A combination of launches and landward forces was used, with about 300 men descending on the area and planting Dubai flags. Seeing the potential of a conflict with Abu Dhabi (which also claimed Ghanadah), the British noted Rashid's breach of the 1853 Perpetual Maritime Treaty and he withdrew.\nSheikh Shakhbut of Abu Dhabi was furious at the incursion, and camel-raiding by Bedouin tribes loyal to Abu Dhabi started to take place. Sheikh Rashid began to retaliate and launched a raid against Abu Dhabi in January 1946, capturing a large number of camels. Measures were taken by the British to force Rashid to stand down, including stopping British India Steam Navigation Company steamers from calling into Dubai on 8 June 1946. The British ruled that Ghanadah belonged to Abu Dhabi, and Dubai agreed to restitution and the return of a number of Abu Dhabi's camels on 15 July 1946.\nThe signing of a treaty in March 1947 was followed by further raiding by parties from the Manasir, Al Bu Shamis and Awamir tribes after Shakhbut failed to pay his Bedouins. Raiders had taken over fifty camels from Dubai by July 1947, and in August and September 300 more camels were taken by raiders and two Dubai men were killed. Abu Dhabi was blockaded by the British, resulting in peace in April 1948. The British drew the line between the two emirates at Hassyan on the coast and Al Ashoosh inland (where it remains), although the border was not finally agreed until 1968.\nThe mountainous area of Masfout was seized from the town's Na\u2019im headman, Saqr bin Sultan Al Hamouda, by Ajman ruler Rashid bin Humaid Al Nuaimi in 1948. After a long and debilitating conflict with its neighbour, Hatta, Masfout could not raise a force to oppose Rashid. Part of Masfout, the village of Sayh Mudayrah and the nearby community of Sinadil, were subject to a border dispute with Oman which was settled with joint sovereignty until a final border settlement in 1998 placed Sinadil on the Omani side of the border.\nBuraimi dispute.\nA group of about 80 Saudi Arabian guards\u00a0\u2013 40 of whom were armed\u00a0\u2013 led by the Saudi Emir of Ras Tanura, Turki Abdullah al Otaishan, crossed Abu Dhabi in 1952, occupied Hamasa (one of three Omani villages in the oasis), and claimed it as part of the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. The sul\u1e6dan of Muscat and imam of Oman gathered their forces to expel the Saudis, but were persuaded by the British government to exercise restraint and attempts to settle the dispute by arbitration. The British military presence increased, leading to the implementation of a standstill agreement and referral of the dispute to an international arbitration tribunal. Arbitration began in Geneva in 1955, but collapsed when British arbitrator Reader Bullard objected to Saudi Arabian attempts to influence the tribunal and withdrew. A few weeks later, the Saudi party was driven from Hamasa by the Trucial Oman Levies. The dispute was finally settled in 1974 by the Treaty of Jeddah between UAE President Sheikh Zayed and King Faisal of Saudi Arabia.\nTrucial States Council.\nThe British instituted the Trucial States Council in 1952 and allocated a Trucial States Development Budget, a limited fund which did little to bolster the resources of the Trucial States' rulers. Abu Dhabi did not strike oil until 1956, and revenue from oil-exploration concessions formed much of the rulers' income. When the Arab League approached them with an offer of a significant development fund, it found a receptive audience.\nAn Arab League delegation headed by Egyptian diplomat and Arab League Secretary-General Abdel Khaleq Hassouna visited the Trucial States on an October 1964 \"mission of brotherhood\", proposing the creation of a \u00a35 million development fund for the states. Ras Al Khaimah ruler Saqr bin Mohammed Al Qasimi and Saqr bin Sultan Al Qasimi of Sharjah, an ardent Arab nationalist, supported the opening of an Arab League office in Sharjah.\nA wave of demonstrations broke out in the streets of the Trucial States, with increasing anti-British sentiment. Long maintaining \"British prestige\" on the Trucial Coast, British administrators were alarmed at the strength of the sentiment and its source: Nasserism and its Soviet backers. British officials petitioned the rulers to turn down the Arab League offer, citing previous treaties in which the trucial rulers pledged not to deal with any foreign government other than the British. Saqr bin Sultan Al Qasimi was obstinate, even when British officials threatened to close his airspace and shut down Sharjah's power station. The British increased funding to the Trucial States Development Fund until it stood at \u00a32.5 million, but the rulers of the Northern States were not impressed; the ruler of Ajman, Rashid bin Humaid Al Nuaimi, said that \"5 million pounds will go further than 2.5 million pounds\".\nTerence Clark, deputy to the ill British Political Agent in Dubai Glencairn Balfour Paul, deposed Saqr bin Sultan Al Qasimi in a 1965 bloodless palace coup. The Trucial Oman Scouts overran Sharjah Fort and removed Saqr\u2019s brother, Abdullah bin Sultan Al Qasimi. Abdullah was accompanied by the son of Ras Al Khaimah ruler Khalid bin Saqr bin Muhammad Al Qasimi.\nSaqr was exiled to Bahrain and, eventually, to Cairo. His cousin, Khalid bin Mohammed Al Qasimi succeeded him as ruler of Sharjah on 25 June 1965.\n\"Dara\" incident.\nOn 7 April 1961, a fierce storm lashed the busy port of Dubai. A ship in port dragged its anchor in heavy waves and smashed into the bow of the 5,000-tonne, 120-meter MV \"Dara\", owned by the British India Steam Navigation Company. The \"Dara\"'s captain decided to leave harbour and ride out the storm in the open sea; the ship left so quickly that a number of officials' and passengers' relatives were still aboard. She sailed with 819 on board, including 132 crew. By dawn on 8 April, the \"Dara\" was returning to Dubai when an explosion destroyed her engine room. Fire broke out and, in the heavy swell, the lifeboats were hard to deploy when the captain called mayday. Three British frigates attended, playing hoses over the blazing decks of the \"Dara\", while an American warship and several civilian vessels helped to pick up passengers. In all, 238 people died in the greatest peacetime maritime disaster since the sinking of the Titanic. An April 1962 investigation found that the \"Dara\" fire was caused by explosives \"practically certainly deliberately placed in the vessel by person or persons unknown\".\nIndependence and union: 1966\u20131971.\nBy 1966, the British government had concluded that it could no longer afford to govern the Trucial States. Deliberation took place in Parliament, with a number of MPs arguing that the Royal Navy would not be able to defend the trucial sheikhdoms. UK Secretary of State for Defence Denis Healey reported that the British Armed Forces were severely overextended and, in some respects, dangerously under-equipped to defend the sheikhdoms. \nOn 16 January 1968, British Prime Minister Harold Wilson announced the decision to end the treaty relationships with the seven trucial sheikhdoms which had been (with Bahrain and Qatar), under British protection. The British decision to withdraw was reaffirmed in March 1971 by Prime Minister Edward Heath.\nThe region faced a host of serious local and regional problems. There were Iranian claims for Bahrain and other islands in the Gulf, territorial disputes between Qatar and Bahrain over Zubarah and the Hawar Islands, and the Buraimi dispute was still unresolved by Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi and Oman. Views differ about the Shah of Iran's intentions; Abdullah Omran Taryam says that Iran was contemplating the occupation of Bahrain and other islands in the Gulf, and Alvandi Roham writes that the Shah had no intention of using force to resolve the Bahrain question and unsuccessfully sought a \"package deal\" with Great Britain for the Tunb Islands and Abu Musa. The rulers of the emirates believed that Britain's continued presence guaranteed the region's safety, and some did not want Britain to withdraw; days after the British announcement to withdraw, Sheikh Zayed tried to persuade them to honour the protection treaties by offering to pay the costs of keeping British armed forces in the Emirates. The British Labour government rebuffed the offer. Dennis Healey said on the BBC TV programme \"Panorama\" that he disliked the idea of being \"a sort of white slaver for Arab sheikhs\", a remark for which he later apologised.\nFederation of nine emirates.\nBetween 8 and 11 January 1968, Labour MP Goronwy Roberts informed the trucial rulers about the British withdrawal. On 18 February, Sheikh Zayed of Abu Dhabi and Sheikh Rashid of Dubai met at Argoub Al Sedirah (a hill in the desert between their emirates) and agreed on the principle of union. They announced their intention to form a coalition, extending an invitation to other Gulf states to join. Later that month, at a summit meeting attended by the rulers of Bahrain, Qatar and the Trucial States, the government of Qatar proposed the formation of a federation of Arab emirates to be governed by a council of nine rulers. The proposal was accepted, and a declaration of union was approved. There was some disagreement among the rulers on matters such as the location of the capital, the drafting of a constitution and the distribution of ministries.\nFurther political issues surfaced when Bahrain attempted to claim a leading role in the nine-state union, and differences emerged among the rulers of the Trucial Coast, Bahrain and Qatar; the latter two were engaged in a long-running dispute over the Hawar Islands. While Dubai's ruler, Sheikh Rashid, had a strong connection to the Qatari ruling family\u00a0\u2013 including the royal intermarriage of his daughter with the son of the Qatari emir\u00a0\u2013 the relationship between Abu Dhabi and Dubai (also cemented by intermarriage; Rashid's wife was a member of Abu Dhabi's ruling family) endured the break-up of talks with Bahrain and Qatar. The sixth meeting, which took place in Abu Dhabi in October 1969, saw Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan elected as the federation's first president. There were stalemates on numerous issues during the meeting, including the position of vice-president, defense of the federation, and whether a constitution was required. A message was read to the Supreme Council from the British Political Resident which triggered a walk-out by delegates who found it patronising, prompting Qatar to withdraw from the federation over what it perceived as foreign interference in its internal affairs. This was the last meeting of the nine-member Supreme Council, and the nine-emirate federation was disbanded despite efforts by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Britain to reinvigorate discussions. Bahrain became independent in August 1971, and Qatar the following month.\nDeclaration of union: 1971\u20131972.\nOn 29 and 30 November 1971, a contingent of the Iranian army supported by naval forces occupied the islands of Abu Musa and the Lesser and Greater Tunbs. On Greater Tunb, six policemen clashed with approximately 2,000 Iranian troops; in the ensuing skirmish, four Ras Al Khaimah policemen and three Iranian soldiers were killed. The Iranian troops demolished the police station, the school, and a number of houses, forcing the natives to leave the island. The dead were buried on the island, and the residents were put on fishing boats and taken to Ras Al Khaimah. The Imperial Iranian Navy seized the islands with little resistance from the small local Arab police force. The population of Greater Tunb in 1971 was 150. The first soldier killed on the island was Salem Suhail bin Khamis, who was shot after he refused to lower the Ras Al Khaimah flag. The death of 20-year-old bin Khamis, the first martyr in the United Arab Emirates, is observed on November 30 as Commemoration Day. The ruler of Sharjah was forced to agree to negotiate for Iranian troops to occupy Abu Musa. His options were to save part of the territory or permanently forego the restoration of the remaining part of the island.\nThe British-Trucial States treaty was annulled on 1 December 1971, and the Trucial States became the United Arab Emirates the following day. Six former Trucial States signed the UAE's founding treaty, with a constitution quickly drafted to meet the 2 December deadline. On that date, at the Dubai Guesthouse (now known as Union House), the rulers of the six emirates agreed to form a union. Although the ruler of Ras Al Khaimah was present, he was not a signatory; Ras Al Khaimah joined the UAE on 10 February 1972. The new state was recognised first by Jordan, on 2 December 1971. The UAE joined the Arab League on 6 December, and the United Nations three days later.\nEstablishment: 1972-2000.\nThe United Arab Emirates' provisional constitution established five federal bodies: the Supreme Council of Rulers; the office of the President; the Cabinet; the Federal National Council (FNC) and the federal judiciary. The constitution also allowed the ruler of each emirate to maintain sovereignty \"over their own territories and territorial waters that are not within the jurisdiction of the Union\". A provision of the 1971 constitution was the establishment of a new capital city for the federation to be built between Dubai and Abu Dhabi and to be called Karama (Dignity). This provision was never enacted.\nA program of nation-building followed; the new nation had no ministries or other formal government bodies, no national infrastructure (roads, telecom, education, and finance) or national currency. The first annual federal budget, promulgated in February 1972, envisaged spending six million BD on social housing, electricity and communication infrastructure (including roads). \nCoups in Sharjah.\nThe former ruler of Sharjah, Sheikh Saqr bin Sultan Al Qasimi, and an armed group supported by Ras Al Khaimah forced his way into the palace of Sharjah ruler Sheikh Khalid bin Mohammed Al Qasimi on 24 January 1972, occupied it, and demanded to be recognized as the ruler of Sharjah. The group took control of the ruler's palace around 2:30 pm, with reports of gunfire and grenade explosions in the palace. Besieged by the Union Defence Force (which arrived an hour later), Saqr surrendered early on 25 January to UAE Minister of Defence Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. Khalid was killed in the fighting.\nSaqr was handed over to Sheikh Zayed by Mohammed and, according to Glencairn Balfour-Paul, \"dropped in an underground hole in Buraimi\". According to other sources, he was tried and imprisoned until 1979 before returning to exile in Cairo.\nOn 25 January 1972, the ruling family in Sharjah met to choose a new ruler for the emirate; Sheikh Sultan bin Muhammad Al-Qasimi, brother of the late ruler, was unanimously chosen to succeed him. The Supreme Council met in emergency session to consider the situation and, in addition to issuing an obituary of Sheikh Kh\u0101lid, proclaimed the accession. The movement to form a union took place at a time of unprecedented instability in the region, with a border dispute resulting in 22 deaths in Kalba and the January 1972 Sharjah coup; the emir of Qatar was deposed by his cousin in February 1972.\nOn 17 June 1987, while Sultan Bin Muhammad Al Qasimi was on holiday in the UK, his elder brother Abdulaziz led a coup. Abdulaziz, faced with unanimous support for Sultan Bin Muhammad by the UAE's rulers, agreed to a reconciliation and assumed the position of crown prince while Sultan was restored as ruler.\nGCC.\nAbu Dhabi hosted the 1981 inaugural meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), a political and economic union which planned to include Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the UAE and Oman.\nTanker war.\nThe newly-integrated UAE Armed Forces first saw action in 1982 with the establishment of the UN-brokered Multi-National Force in Lebanon, a peacekeeping role. UAE forces held similar peacekeeping roles in Somalia in 1992 and Kosovo in 1999.\nFor much of the 1980s, as the Iran-Iraq conflict and its associated tanker war in the Gulf intensified, the UAE Armed Forces were in a state of high alert. In the face of the threat of repercussions from the conflict, the GCC carried out the October 1983 Operation Peninsula Shield (its first joint military exercise). This led to the decision to create the joint Peninsula Shield Force the following year.\nIran and Iraq targeted each other's oil facilities and attempted to block oil exports by attacking neutral shipping. Kuwaiti tankers tended to ship Iraqi oil, and were frequently targeted by Iran. The US re-flagged Kuwaiti oil tankers with US flags and assigned warships to escort Kuwaiti tankers through the Strait of Hormuz. The operation's first casualty, the \"Earnest Will\", was an American frigate hit by Iraqi Exocet missiles. The Iranians laid mines in the Gulf, leading to the mining of the \"Bridgeton\" (a re-flagged Kuwaiti tanker).\nThe escalation continued; US forces attacked Iranian Revolutionary Guard units based on oil platforms, destroying three Iranian rigs. In July 1988, the USS \"Vincennes\" was involved in an action against harrying Iranian gunboats. The \"Vincennes\" mistakenly targeted an Iranian Airbus A300 flying a scheduled route from Tehran to Dubai and shot it down, with the loss of all 290 passengers and crew. Two weeks later, the Iranians accepted UN Security Council Resolution 598 calling for an end to the war.\n21st century.\n2000\u20132020.\nAfter the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States, the UAE was identified as a financial centre used by Al-Qaeda to transfer money to the hijackers. The nation immediately cooperated with the United States, freezing accounts tied to suspected terrorists and clamping down on money laundering. The country had signed a military-defence agreement with the United States in 1994, and with France in 1977.\nThe UAE supported military operations from the United States and other coalition nations engaged in the invasion of Afghanistan (2001) and Iraq (2003) and operations supporting the global War on Terrorism for the Horn of Africa at Al Dhafra Air Base, outside Abu Dhabi. The airbase also supported Allied operations during the 1991 Persian Gulf War and Operation Enduring Freedom.\nThe UAE's first president, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, died on 2 November 2004. His eldest son, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, succeeded him as ruler of Abu Dhabi. In accordance with the constitution, the UAE's Supreme Council of Rulers elected Khalifa president. Sheikh Mohammad bin Zayed Al Nahyan succeeded Khalifa as crown prince of Abu Dhabi. Sheikh Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the prime minister of the UAE and the ruler of Dubai, died in January 2006; and Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum assumed both roles.\nIn March 2006, the United States forced the state-owned Dubai Ports World to relinquish control of terminals at six major American ports. Critics of the ports deal feared an increased risk of terrorist attack, saying that the UAE was home to two of the 9/11 hijackers.\nIn December 2006, the UAE prepared for its first election to determine half the members of UAE's Federal National Council from 450 candidates. Only 7,000 Emirati citizens (less than one percent of the Emirati population) had the right to vote in the election; the manner of selection was opaque, but women were included in the electorate.\nIn August 2011, the Middle East experienced a number of pro-democratic uprisings popularly known as the Arab Spring. The UAE had comparatively little unrest but in a high-profile case, five political activists were arrested for defamation by insulting heads of state (UAE president Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, vice president Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, and Abu Dhabi crown prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan) on an anti-government website. The trial of the UAE Five attracted international publicity and protest from a number of human-rights groups, including Amnesty International, which called the five men prisoners of conscience. The defendants were convicted and given two- to three-year prison sentences on 27 November 2011.\nOn 25 September 2019, Hazza Al Mansouri flew aboard the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft to the International Space Station, where he stayed for eight days as the first Emirati in space.\nSince 2020.\nThe first confirmed COVID-19 case in the United Arab Emirates was announced on 29 January 2020. It was the first country in the Middle East to report a confirmed case.\nThe United Arab Emirates launched the Emirates Mars Mission that year, a United Arab Emirates Space Agency uncrewed space exploration mission to Mars. The Hope probe was launched on 19 July 2020, and went into orbit around Mars on 9 February 2021. The United Arab Emirates became the first Arab country and the fifth country to reach Mars, and the second country to enter Mars' orbit on its first try (after India). In April 2023, \"The New York Times\" reported an updated global map of Mars based on images from the Hope spacecraft.\nDuring the early 2020s, the UAE began overhauling its criminal and civil laws. It legalized alcohol, ended lighter punishments for honor killings, enacted harsher punishments for rape and sexual harassment, allowed foreigners to follow their home-country's family laws for marriage and inheritance rather than Sharia, reduced penalties for drugs and having a child when unmarried, and allowed unmarried couples to live together. Economic changes have allowed foreigners to own businesses without a UAE partner. The UAE moved to a Saturday-Sunday weekend at the beginning of 2022, with Friday a working half-day. Homosexuality remained illegal, although a new 21+ age rating allowed uncensored movies to be shown.\nExpo 2020 was a World Expo hosted by Dubai from 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2022. Originally scheduled for 20 October 2020 to 10 April 2021, it was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Arab Emirates. Despite the postponement, organizers kept the name Expo 2020 for marketing and branding purposes. The event recorded more than 24 million visits in its six months.\nOn 22 February 2022, the Museum of the Future was opened by the government. The date was chosen because it is a palindrome date. The museum is devoted to Dubai's innovative and futuristic technologies. On 14 May 2022, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan was elected as UAE president after the death of Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan.\nThe Emirates Lunar Mission was the first mission to the Moon from the UAE. The mission by Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre (MBRSC) sent a lunar rover named Rashid to the Moon aboard ispace's Hakuto-R Mission 1 lander. Launched on 11 December 2022 on a Falcon 9 Block 5 rocket, the rover attempted to land in the Atlas crater. On 25 April 2023, seconds before the attempted landing, communication with the Hakuto-R lander was lost. The ispace team confirmed that the spacecraft had crashed into the Moon and was destroyed.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The UAE lies between 22\u00b050\u2032 and 26\u00b0 north latitude and between 51\u00b0 and 56\u00b025\u2032 east longitude. It shares a border with Qatar on the northwest, a border with Saudi Arabia on the west, south, and southeast, and a border with Oman on the southeast and northeast.\nThe land border with Qatar in the Khor Al Adaid area is a source of long-running dispute (in fact, whether it even shares a land border with Qatar is in dispute). The total area of the UAE is approximately . The country's exact size is unknown because of disputed claims to several islands in the Persian Gulf, because of the lack of precise information on the size of many of these islands, and because most of its land boundaries, especially with Saudi Arabia, remain undemarcated. The largest emirate, Abu Dhabi, accounts for 87 percent of the UAE's total area (). The smallest emirate, Ajman, encompasses only .\nBoundaries.\nThe UAE stretches for more than along the southern shore of the Persian Gulf. Most of the coast consists of salt pans that extend far inland. A recent global remote sensing analysis suggested that there were 637 km2 of tidal flats in the United Arab Emirates, making it the 40th ranked country in terms of tidal flat extent. The largest natural harbor is at Dubai, although other ports have been dredged at Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, and elsewhere. Numerous islands are found in the Persian Gulf, and the ownership of some of them has been the subject of international disputes with both Iran and Qatar. The smaller islands, as well as many coral reefs and shifting sandbars, are a menace to navigation. Strong tides and occasional windstorms further complicate ship movements near the shore.\nThese northern emirates on the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman are part of the Gulf of Oman desert and semi-desert ecoregion.\nSouth and west of Abu Dhabi, vast, rolling sand dunes merge into the Rub' al Khali (Empty Quarter) of Saudi Arabia. The desert area of Abu Dhabi includes two important oases with adequate underground water for permanent settlements and cultivation. The extensive Liwa Oasis is in the south near the undefined border with Saudi Arabia, and about to the northeast is Al Buraymi Oasis, which extends on both sides of the Abu Dhabi-Oman border.\nPrior to withdrawing from the area in 1971, Britain delineated the internal borders among the seven emirates in order to pre-empt territorial disputes that might hamper formation of the federation. In general, the rulers of the emirates accepted the British intervention, but in the case of boundary disputes between Abu Dhabi and Dubai, and also between Dubai and Sharjah, conflicting claims were not resolved until after the UAE became independent. The most complicated borders were in the Western Mountains, where five of the emirates contested jurisdiction over more than a dozen enclaves.\nMountains.\nThe UAE also extends for about along the Gulf of Oman, an area known as Al-Batinah coast. The Western Hajar Mountains (\"Jib\u0101l Al-\u1e24ajar Al-Gharb\u012b\"), rising in places to , separate Al-Batinah coast from the rest of the UAE. Beginning at the UAE-Oman border on the Persian Gulf coast of the \"Ras Musandam\" (Musandam Peninsula), the Western Mountains extend southeastward for about to the southernmost UAE-Oman frontier on the Gulf of Oman. The range continues as the Eastern Hajar Mountains (\"Jib\u0101l Al-\u1e24ajar Ash-Sharq\u012b\") for more than into Oman. The steep mountain slopes run directly to the shore in many places. Nevertheless, there are small harbors at Dibba Al-Hisn, Kalba, and Khor Fakkan on the Gulf of Oman. In the vicinity of Fujairah, where the mountains do not approach the coast, there are sandy beaches.\nClimate.\nThe climate of the UAE generally is very hot and sunny. The hottest months are July and August, when average maximum temperatures reach above on the coastal plain. In the Western Hajar Mountains, temperatures are considerably cooler, a result of increased altitude. Average minimum temperatures in January and February are between . During the late summer months, a humid southeastern wind known as the sharqi makes the coastal region especially unpleasant. The average annual rainfall in the coastal area is less than , but in some mountainous areas annual rainfall often reaches . Rain in the coastal region falls in short, torrential bursts during the summer months, sometimes resulting in floods in ordinarily dry wadi beds. The region is prone to occasional, violent dust storms, which can severely reduce visibility. The Jebel Jais mountain cluster in Ras Al Khaimah has experienced snow only four times (2004, 2009, 2017 and 2020) since records began.\nFlora and fauna.\nDate palms, as well as acacia and eucalyptus trees, are commonly found growing at the region's oases. Within the desert itself, the flora is much more sparse and primarily consists of grasses and thornbushes.\nThe region's indigenous fauna had previously come close to extinction due to intensive hunting, which led to a 1970s conservation program on the Bani Yas island by Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan; this resulted in the survival of Arabian oryxes and leopards, among others. The region's coastal fish consist mainly of mackerel, perch and tuna, as well as sharks and whales.\nArea and land boundaries.\nArea:\nLand boundaries:\nCoastline: \nMaritime claims:\nElevation extremes:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This led to an influx of workers from diverse cultural and religious backgrounds, increasing the population from 4 million in 2004 to roughly 11.35 million in 2024. As of 2024, foreigners represent 88.50% of the population, the third largest proportion of expats in the world in relation to the nationals after Qatar and the Vatican. As of 2024, the largest group of non-UAE nationals are South Asian 68.36% (Indians 37.96%,Pakistanis 16.72%, Bangladeshis 7.38% and others 6.3%), Filipinos 6.1%, Iranians 4.72%, Egyptians 4.23% and other 2.16%.\nFemale citizens and non-citizens account for 36.20% percent of the UAE's population due to the high level of male foreign workers. The majority of the UAE population is between 25 and 54 years old 64.12%. A large part of this can be attributed to the expatriate worker population who fall in the age category. Population is heavily concentrated to the northeast on the Musandam Peninsula. The three largest Emirates (Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Sharjah), are home to nearly 83% of the population.\nAs of 2024 the population of the UAE stood at 11.35 million, with 63.80% being male and 36.20% female. The country's total fertility rate (TFR) was 1.46, while that of the Emirati citizen population was 3.1, significantly higher than the national average, though reflecting a 16% decline from 3.7 in 2015.

English is the most used language amongst expatriates and in business. Arabic is the main medium of instruction at all levels of schooling in government schools, while English is taught as a second language and used for teaching technical or scientific subjects. Private schools can follow a different curriculum (British, American, French, Pakistani, etc.) and use a different language.\nEmirati people speak Gulf Arabic. The Achomi language (Persian dialect) is also spoken by a 303,000 people in the UAE.\nOther languages spoken in the UAE, due to immigration, include other Arabic dialects (such as Levantine Arabic), Malayalam (1,060,000 speakers in the UAE), Hindi\u2013Urdu, Marathi, Persian, Cebuano, Pashto (144,000 speakers in the UAE), Kannada, Bengali (337,000 speakers in the UAE), Punjabi (201,000 speakers in the UAE), Odia, Telugu, Baluchi and Southern Baluchi (379,000 speakers in the UAE), Sinhala (121,000 speakers in the UAE), Russian, Ukrainian, Somali, Tagalog (303,000 speakers in the UAE), Nepali, Mandarin, Tamil (455,000 speakers in the UAE), Spanish, Italian and Greek.\nIn 2019, Abu Dhabi included Hindi as third official court language.

{"id": "31837", "revid": "26161718", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31837", "title": "Politics of the United Arab Emirates", "text": "Politics of the United Arab Emirates take place in a framework of a federal presidential elective semi-constitutional monarchy (a federation of absolute monarchies). The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a federation of seven constituent monarchies: the Emirates of Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Dubai, Fujairah, Ras al-Khaimah, Sharjah, and Umm al-Quwain.\nAccording to convention, the ruler of Abu Dhabi (Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan) is the president of the United Arab Emirates (despite holding the title of president, the country is not governed as a presidential republic) and the head of state, and the ruler of Dubai is the prime minister of the United Arab Emirates, the head of the government. Within the UAE, emirates have considerable administrative autonomy within themselves.\nThe UAE is an authoritarian state. The UAE has been described as a \"tribal autocracy\" where the seven constituent monarchies are led by tribal rulers in an autocratic fashion. There are no democratically elected institutions, and there is no formal commitment to free speech.\nThe discovery of oil in Abu Dhabi in 1958 and the country's subsequent oil wealth has defined its politics and economy, as well as shaped its foreign policy behavior.\nExecutive branch.\nAdministratively, the UAE is a federation of seven emirates, each with its own ruler. The pace of local government reform in each emirate is set primarily by the ruler. Under the provisional constitution of 1971, each emirate reserves considerable powers, including control over mineral rights (notably oil) and revenues. In this milieu, federal powers have developed slowly as each Emirate already had its own existing institutions of government prior to the country's official foundation. The Constitution of the United Arab Emirates separates powers into executive, legislative, and judicial branches. Additionally, legislative and executive powers are divided into federal and emirate jurisdictions.\nThe constitution of the United Arab Emirates established the positions of president (chief of state) and vice president elected by the rulers of each of the emirates from within (the seven rulers comprise the Federal Supreme Council, which also has an elected chairman and a vice chairman each serving five-year terms); a Council of Ministers (cabinet), led by a prime minister (head of government); a supreme council of rulers; and a 40-member National Assembly (known as the Federal National Council), a consultative body whose members are partially appointed by the emirate rulers and partially elected; and an independent judiciary which includes the Federal Supreme Court. Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan was president of the UAE from its foundation until his death on November 2, 2004. His oldest son, Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, was president until his death May 13, 2022. On 14 May 2022, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan was elected as the UAE's new president after the death of Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan.\nUnder federal authority, responsibilities include foreign affairs, security and defense, nationality and immigration issues, education, public health, currency, postal, telephone and other communications services, air traffic control, licensing of aircraft, labour relations, banking, delimitation of territorial waters and extradition of criminals. Issues excluded from Articles 120 and 121 of the Constitution are to be under the jurisdiction of respective emirates and are reaffirmed by Article 116 which states that: \u2018the emirates shall exercise all powers not assigned to the federation by this Constitution\u2019. This is further reiterated by Article 122, which stated that \u2018the emirates shall have jurisdiction in all matters not assigned to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federation, in accordance with the provision of the preceding two articles\u2019.\nFederal Supreme Council.\nThe Federal Supreme Council consists of the individual rulers of the seven emirates. The president and vice-president are elected by the Supreme Council every five years. Although unofficial, the presidency is \"de facto\" hereditary to the Al Nahyan clan of Abu Dhabi and the prime minister post \"de facto\" is hereditary to the Al Maktoum clan of Dubai.\nArticle 47 of the UAE constitution defines the powers of the council's authority in formulation of general policy; legislation on all matters of state; ratification of federal laws and decrees, including those relating to budget and fiscal matters; ratification of international treaties and agreements; and appointment of the prime minister and Supreme Court judges. Decisions are made by majority vote unless relating to substantive issues which require a two-thirds majority vote (five out of seven rulers), which must include Abu Dhabi and Dubai. The Supreme Council also elects the Council of Ministers, while an appointed 40-member Federal National Council, drawn from all the emirates, reviews proposed laws.\nCouncil of Ministers (Cabinet).\nThe Cabinet of United Arab Emirates (also called the Council of Ministers, ) is a collegial body presided over by the prime minister. It consists of 22 members and is also headed by a prime minister (chosen by the president with consultation). The federal cabinet is the executive authority for the federation. Under the supreme control of the president and supreme council, it manages all internal and foreign affairs of the federation under its constitutional and federal laws. The cabinet consists of cabinet's chairman (prime minister of UAE) and two deputies and ministers. The general secretariat shall be handled by the secretary general of the cabinet.\nLocal politics.\nThe relative prestige and financial influence of each emirate is reflected in the allocation of positions in the federal government. The ruler of Abu Dhabi, whose emirate is the UAE's major oil producer, is president of the UAE. The ruler of Dubai, which is the UAE's commercial center and a former oil producer, is vice president and prime minister.\nSince achieving independence in 1971, the UAE has worked to strengthen its federal institutions. Nonetheless, each emirate still retains substantial autonomy, and progress toward greater federal integration has slowed in recent years. A basic concept in the UAE government's development as a federal system is that a significant percentage of each emirate's revenues should be devoted to the UAE central budget.\nAlthough complexity of local government differs depending on size and development of each emirate, most (such as Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah and Ajman) have their own executive councils chaired by their respective rulers and possessing various departments reflective of federal ministries. Various autonomous agencies also exist such as the environment, tourism, culture and health agencies. Some emirates such as Abu Dhabi may also be divided into two municipalities (the Western and Eastern regions) and its main cities of Abu Dhabi and Al Ain are also administered by their own municipalities with a municipal council. Abu Dhabi and Sharjah also have their own national consultative councils with similar local duties and role as the Federal National Council.\nIt has long been regional tradition for rulers to hold open discussions with their people, be they common, merchants or the elite. Often, this forum is held by the emirate rulers as well as senior family members. This open majlis, or consultation, is held periodically; however, a ruler may also appoint an emir, or wali, to whom concerns may be directed by the general population when necessary. This individual is often considered a leading tribal figure whose trust is placed by his tribe as well as the ruler.\nLegislature.\nThe Federal National Council (\"al-Majlis al-Watani al-Ittihadi\") is the UAE's legislative body and consists of 40 members. The body only has advisory powers. Twenty of the members are indirectly elected by the hand-picked 33% of Emirati citizens who have voting rights through an electoral college, while the other twenty are appointed by the rulers of each emirate. According to Reuters, \"the process of selecting the people who can either elect or be elected is opaque.\"\nPolitical parties are banned. Al Islah, the only large-scale underground political party, operates underground but it considered a terrorist group by the UAE government since 2014 and has been federally banned since 2011.\nThe FNC is the main consultative body in the UAE and has both a legislative and supervisory role accorded by the Constitution.\nSince the council's inception, the following have been selected as speakers:\nThani Abdullah Humaid, Taryam Omran Taryam, Hilal bin Ahmed bin Lootah, Al Haj bin Abdullah Al Muhairbi, Mohammed Khalifa Habtour, Saeed Mohammad Al Gandi, Abdul Aziz Al Ghurair, Mohammad Al-Murr, and Amal Al Qubaisi since 2015.\nFederal Judiciary.\nThe Federal Judiciary is a constitutionally completely independent body (under Article 94) and includes the Federal Supreme Court and Courts of First Instance. Supreme Council of Rulers appoints the five judges headed by a president to the Supreme Court. The judges are responsible for deciding if federal laws are constitutional, mediating between inter-emirate disputes. It also possesses the authority to try cases involving cabinet and senior federal officials. Although secular law is applied, the basis of legislation is Sharia (Islamic Law) and involves three of the four schools including (mainly) Maliki, but also the Hanbali and Shafi'i schools.\nCriticism.\nAccording to Jim Krane \"The UAE\u2019s rulers now maintain power and legitimacy by giving generous subsidies to their citizens, known as Emiratis, essentially buying their support. The majority is happy with this unspoken bargain, which holds sway in most of the Gulf. The sheikhs get public backing in return for improvements in living standards, including jobs, homes, health care, and education. Tribal autocracy is one of the oldest ways of organizing society and the only form of governance the UAE has ever known.\nOn 2 April 2021, 91-year-old German philosopher J\u00fcrgen Habermas rejected the Sheikh Zayed Book Award worth 750,000 UAE dirhams prize money. Habermas earlier accepted the award, but later called it \u201ca wrong decision,\u201d which he corrected by rejecting it in April 2021. In a critical statement, Habermas cited his previous unawareness of the fact that the awarding institution had close connections with the existing political system of the country, which is a dictatorship as cited in a 2020 report published by Amnesty International.\nMenas Associates, a risk analysis firm, published a report highlighting escalating tensions between the UAE and Algeria, which accused the Emirates of collaborating with Morocco and Israel to undermine Algeria\u2019s interest in Western Sahara. The Emirati alliance was also accused of working to destabilize the Sahel region. The association between the UAE, Morocco and Israel was viewed as a part of a broader conspiracy against Algerian interests. In a press conference, Louisa Hanoune accused the UAE of \u2018collecting money to arm Morocco\u2019 and using their investments in Algeria. Additionally, the Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune claimed to have evidence proving that the UAE bribed Abdelaziz Bouteflika with around US$300 million for over 15 years in exchange of economic or political benefits. Meanwhile, the Emirati intelligence services claimed to have compromising files on Algeria\u2019s destabilizing activities in Sahel. Algeria requested Kuwait to be a mediator to de-escalate tensions with the UAE.\nPolitical reform and Arab spring.\nIn early 2007, the United Arab Emirates launched the 'UAE Government Strategy' for the years ahead, which covered twenty-one topics in six different sectors including social development, economic development, public sector development, justice and safety, infrastructure and rural areas development. The initiative is meant to reevaluate and advance these sectors towards top global standards by facilitating better continuous cooperation between federal and local governments with increased efficiency, training, Emiratisation, ministry empowerment, upgrading of services, improving civil service and legislation review.\nSubsequently, in 2007\u20132008, Abu Dhabi announced the implementation of its own policy to modernise public administration practices and government performance. Plans for reevaluation were laid out in areas including economy, energy, tourism, health, education, labour, civil services, culture and heritage, good control, urban planning, transport, environment, health and safety, municipal affairs, police and emergency services, electronic government, women and legislative reform. Abu Dhabi hopes advancements towards global standards in these areas will improve the quality of services for its residents as well as attract future investment towards further modernising the Emirate.\nAs of 2011, the country did not see the type of popular struggle other Arab countries saw during the Arab spring. There were minor protests, during which some people were arrested.\nThe 2023 international investigation series Abu Dhabi Secrets revealed United Arab Emirates\u2019 influence strategy to spy on citizens of 18 countries in Europe and beyond. Using a Swiss intelligence firm Alp Services the UAE intelligence services received the names of more than 1000 individuals and 400 organizations in 18 European countries, labelling them as part of the Muslim Brotherhood network in Europe.\nThe Economist Intelligence Unit rated the United Arab Emirates an \"authoritarian regime\" in .\nInternational organization affiliations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons\n "}

In 2009, more than 85% of the UAE's economy was based on the oil exports. In 2011, oil exports accounted for 77% of the UAE's state budget. In recent years, there has been some economic diversification, particularly in Dubai. Abu Dhabi and other UAE emirates have remained relatively conservative in their approach to diversification. Dubai has far smaller oil reserves than its counterparts.\nHospitality is one of the biggest non-commodity sources of revenue in the UAE.\nIn 2007, there was US$350 billion worth of active construction projects.\nThe UAE is a member of the UNCTAD, World Trade Organization and OPEC.\nEconomic overview.\nUAE has the second-largest economy in the Arab world (after Saudi Arabia), with a gross domestic product (GDP) of US$414 billion (AED 1.52 trillion) in 2018. A third of the GDP is from oil revenues. The economy was expected to grow 4\u20134.5% in 2013, compared to 2.3\u20133.5% over the previous five years. Since independence in 1971, UAE's economy has grown by nearly 231 times to AED1.45 trillion in 2013. The non-oil trade has grown to AED1.2 trillion, a growth of around 28 times from 1981 to 2012.\nThe UAE's economy is one of the most open worldwide, and its economic history goes back to the times when ships sailed to India, along the Swahili coast, as far south as Mozambique.\nThe UAE economy has been \u2018inspected\u2019 by international economic institutions on a regular basis, generally receiving good reports on economic developments. International Monetary Fund (IMF) expected UAE's economic growth to increase to 4.5% in 2015, compared to 4.3% in 2014. The IMF ascribed UAE's potentially strong economic growth in World Economic Outlook Report to the increased contribution of non-petroleum sectors, which registered a growth average of more than 6% in 2014 and 2015. Such contribution includes banking, tourism, commerce and real estate. Increase of Emirati purchasing power and governmental expenditures in infrastructure projects have considerably increased.\nInternationally, UAE is ranked among the top 20 for global service business, according to AT Kearney, the top 30 on the WEF \"most-networked countries\" and in the top quarter as a least corrupt country per the TI's corruption index.\nThe government of the United Arab Emirates announced a broad restructuring and merger of more than 50% of its federal agencies, including ministries and departments, in an attempt to deal with and recover from the economic shocks following months-long coronavirus lockdown.\nHistorical background.\nBefore independence from the United Kingdom and unification in 1971, each emirate was responsible for its own economy. At the time, pearl diving, seafaring and fishing were together the mainstay of the economy, until the development of Japanese cultured pearls and the discovery of commercial quantities of oil. Previous UAE President Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan is credited with bringing the country forward into the 20th century and using the revenue from oil exports to fund all the necessary development. Likewise, former UAE vice-president Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum had a bold vision for the Emirate of Dubai and foresaw the future in not petroleum alone, but also other industries.\nIn the 1980s, Dubai's diversification centred around trade and the creation of shipping and logistics centres, notably Port Rashid and the port and Free Zone of Jebel Ali as well as Dubai International Airport, leading to a number of major global plays in shipping, transportation and logistics (DP World, Emirates, DNATA).\n2008-present.\nThe emergence of Dubai's lively real estate market was briefly stopped by the 2008 financial crisis, when Dubai was bailed out by Abu Dhabi. The recovery from the overheated market led to tighter regulation and oversight and a more realistic market for real estate throughout the UAE with many 'on hold' projects restarting. Although the market continues to expand, current market conditions for developers have been characterised as 'tough'.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Arab Emirates, the UAE's economy shrank by 6.1% in 2020. The country's account balance dropped to six per cent of GDP in 2020 from 8.5 per cent in 2019 due to the underperformance of both hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon exports mitigated by lower imports.\nIn late 2021, the authority announced that UAE's banking assets are expected to grow by between 8 per cent and 10 per cent in 2022 as the second-biggest Arab economy continues to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. It was also announced the UAE's economy might grow at a faster than projected rate, reaching 4.6% in 2022.\nIn March 2022, the UAE was put in the \u201cgray list\u201d by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) over money laundering and terror financing concerns. In February 2024, the country was successfully removed from the watchlist and escaped the FATF's monitoring process. While the global watchdog said the Emirates addressed the shortcomings, critics argued that the move was driven by political considerations. In December 2022, the European Commission added the UAE to its blacklist over illicit financial flows. In January 2025, the UAE Economy Minister Abdulla bin Touq Al Marri criticized the EU for continuing to consider the country on its blacklist, despite its removal from the FATF's \u201cgray list\u201d. In July 2025, the European Parliament approved the European Commission's updated money laundering blacklist that removed the UAE, despite earlier opposition from the MEPs. Transparency International, along with lawmaker and civil society groups, criticized the Parliament's decision, saying it is premature to judge if the UAE's reforms are effective and that the decision appears to be politically motivated.\nData.\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980\u20132024 (with IMF estimates between 2022 and 2028).\nExternal trade.\nWith imports totaling $273.5 billion in 2012, UAE passed Saudi Arabia as the largest consumer market in the region. Exports totaled $314 billion, making UAE the second largest exporter in the region.\nUAE and India are each other's main trading partners, with the latter having many of its citizens working and living in the former. The trade totals over $75 billion (AED275.25 billion).\nIn 2021, the main export partners of the UAE were India (14.2%), Japan (8.3%), China (mainland) (7.7%), Saudi Arabia (7.5%), Iraq (4.8%), Singapore (4.0%), the European Union (4.0%), Oman (3.8%), Hong Kong (3.4%), and Thailand (3.0%).\nThe main import partners in 2012 were China (17.3%), the European Union (12.1%), India (9.4%), the United States (5.5%), Saudi Arabia (5.2%), the United Kingdom (2.8%), Mali (2.7%), Japan (2.6%), Turkey (2.1%), and Vietnam (2.0%).\nDiversification of the UAE's economy.\nAlthough the UAE has the most diversified economy in the GCC, the UAE's economy remains extremely reliant on oil. With the exception of Dubai, most of the UAE is dependent on oil revenues. Petroleum and natural gas continue to play a central role in the economy, especially in Abu Dhabi. More than 85% of the UAE's economy was based on the oil exports in 2009. While Abu Dhabi and other UAE emirates have remained relatively conservative in their approach to diversification, Dubai, which has far smaller oil reserves, was bolder in its diversification policy. In 2011, oil exports accounted for 77% of the UAE's state budget.\nDubai suffered from a significant economic crisis in 2007\u20132010 and was bailed out by Abu Dhabi's oil wealth. Dubai's current prosperity has been attributed to Abu Dhabi's petrodollars. In 2014, Dubai owed a total of $142 billion in debt. The UAE government has worked towards reducing the economy's dependence on oil exports by 2030. Various projects are underway to help achieve this, the most recent being the Khalifa Port, opened in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi at the end of 2012. The UAE also won the right to host the World Expo 2020, which is believed to have a positive effect on future growth, although there are some skeptics which mention the opposite.\nOver the decades, the Emirate of Dubai has started to look for additional sources of revenue. High-class tourism and international finance continue to be developed. In line with this initiative, the Dubai International Financial Centre was announced, offering 55.5% foreign ownership, no withholding tax, freehold land and office space and a tailor-made financial regulatory system with laws taken from best practice in other leading financial centers, like New York, London, Z\u00fcrich and Singapore. A new stock market for regional companies and other initiatives was announced in DIFC. Dubai has also developed Internet and Media free zones, offering 100% foreign ownership, no tax office space for the world's leading ICT and media companies, with the latest communications infrastructure to service them. Many of the world's leading companies have now set up branch offices, and even changed headquarters to, there. Recent liberalization in the property market allowing non-citizens to buy freehold land has resulted in a major boom in the construction and real estate sectors, with several signature developments, such as the 2 Palm Islands, the World (archipelago), Dubai Marina, Jumeirah Lake Towers, and a number of other developments, offering villas and high rise apartments and office space. Emirates (part of the Emirates Group) was formed by the Dubai Government in the 1980s and is presently one of the few airlines to witness strong levels of growth. Emirates is also the largest operator of the Airbus A380 aircraft. As of 2001[ [update]], budgeted government revenues were about AED 29.7 billion, and expenditures were about AED 22.9 billion. In addition, to finding new ways of sustaining the national economy, the UAE has also made progress in installing new, sustainable methods of generating electricity. This is evidenced by various solar energy initiatives at Masdar City and by other renewable energy developments in parts of the country.\nIn addition, the UAE is starting to see the emergence of local manufacturing as a new source of economic development. Examples of significant government-led investments, such as https:// in the aerospace industry, under Mubadala, are successful, while there are also small scale entrepreneurial ventures picking up, such as Zarooq Motors in the automotive industry.\nIn August 2020, the Barakah nuclear power plant, the first nuclear power plant in the Arab world, became operational.\nIn its hard push for economic diversification, the UAE had been increasing its presence in Africa. One of the areas of interest had been clean energy, for which Abu Dhabi's Masdar built infrastructure, including five wind farms in South Africa, a battery energy storage system in Senegal and solar power facilities in Mauritania. Emirati companies were also investing in fossil fuels, where ADNOC purchased 10% stakes in Mozambique\u2019s Rovuma gas basin. UAE\u2019s e&amp; also established a foothold in around 12 countries across Africa. The Emirati companies also entered the mining sector, where Tahnoun bin Zayed\u2019s International Holding Company expressed investment interests in mines in Kenya, Tanzania and Angola. However, certain investments had also been controversial. Tanzanian authorities were alleged of forcing several Maasai off their land for a safari and hunting project of an Emirati firm. A Dubai-based firm, Blue Carbon, signed preliminary agreements in Liberia, Tanzania, Kenya, Zambia and Zimbabwe, aiming to generate carbon credits. However, it was accused of attempting to acquire millions of hectares of African forests in a greenwashing attempt. Meanwhile, DP World also invested around $3bn in Africa, and operates ports from Mozambique in the south to Algeria in the north and Angola on the Atlantic. The Emirates had also been alleged of controversial actions in the war zones in Africa, including in Libya and Sudan.\nThe UAE targeted another major milestone in its diversification plans, as it granted a \u201cCommercial Gaming Facility Operator\u201d license to Wynn Resorts in October 2024. Wynn is developing a $3.9 billion integrated resort, Wynn Al Marjan Island, in Ras Al Khaimah, which will also include a 224,000 sq. ft. casino component. Set to open in 2027, the project aims at targeting foreign tourists and boosting tourism. Although the UAE established the General Commercial Gaming Regulatory Authority (GCGRA) in September 2023, it has no laws that legalize gambling or its tools and machines. Gambling remains a cultural taboo and illegal for local citizens. Despite the casino facility being constructed in the Emirates, project operators and insiders avoided talking publicly about it.\nForeign trade.\nConcerning foreign trade, the UAE's market is one of the world's most dynamic markets, placed among the 16 largest exporters and 20 largest importers of commodities. The top five Main Partner Countries of the UAE in 2014 were Iran (3.0%), India (2.9%), Saudi Arabia (1.5%), Oman (1.4%) and Switzerland (1.2%). The top five UAE suppliers are China (7.4%), United States (6.4%), India (5.8%), Germany (3.9%) and Japan (3.5%).\nIn 2014, the United Arab Emirates managed to export 380.4bn dominated by four products which are https:// (19.8%) https:// (3.4%) https://(3.2%) incl. gold plated with platinum, unwrought...https://(2.8%). In the same year, the United Arab Emirates imported 298.6 bn dominated by five countries which are China (7.4%), United States (6.4%), India (5.8%), Germany (3.9%), Japan (3.5%).\nOn one hand, the United Arab Emirates managed in 2013 to export 17 bn USD services exported in 2013 dominated by travel (67.13%), transportation (28.13%), Government services (4.74%). On the other hand, it imported 63.9 bn USD of services imported services dominated by transportation (70.68%), travel (27.70%) and government services (1.62%).\nIn September 2021, the UAE announced plans to increase trade ties with other economies, particularly in Asia and Africa. The country indicated that it was seeking inward foreign investments of around $150 billion in the next nine years, that is, by 2030. The UAE aimed to be one of the world's ten largest investment destinations. However, it faced strong competition from its neighbor, Saudi Arabia, creating a broader gap in the once-assumed alliance between the two countries. The Emirati minister of state for foreign trade said, \"Let the Saudis increase the competition. It means the pie is going to be bigger and having a bigger pie means that the UAE share out of this pie is going to be bigger.\"\nThe EU identified that Emirati firms were involved in the direct trade of weapon components to Russia. EU sanctions targeted two UAE-based companies, I Jet Global and Success Aviation Services, which were exporting dual-use goods. The EU warned that countries that will be used for Russia's benefit could face a total ban on imports from the EU military and high tech kit. Furthermore, a trade war with the UAE was expected, if it continued trade with Russia.\nThe United Arab Emirates has introduced significant changes to its regulations concerning the promotion and distribution of foreign investment funds within the country. As part of these changes, encapsulated in several decisions by the Securities and Commodities Authority, foreign-owned funds can no longer directly advertise or distribute units publicly in the UAE. Instead, these activities are confined to private distribution aimed at Professional Investors and/or Market Counterparties. This shift signifies a strategic move to tighten the circumstances under which foreign funds can interact with UAE-based investors, particularly Retail Customers and Professional Investors, underscoring a push towards a more regulated investment environment.\nThese regulatory updates have also led to changes in the distribution to Professional Investors, as they are now no longer exempt under the Securities and Commodities Authority Rulebook. Only firms licensed by the SCA to conduct the regulated activity of \"Promotion\" are now permitted to promote such funds, and only on a private placement basis. Furthermore, the promotion or distribution of foreign funds to retail investors is outright prohibited, although reverse solicitation from retail investors is not prohibited in itself. All foreign funds to be distributed in the UAE must be registered with the SCA, barring those that can prove documented reverse solicitation.\nThree Emirati companies were found involved in trade of Iranian petroleum or petrochemical products, and were sanctioned by the US State Department in June 2024. One of the companies was Sea Route Ship Management FZE, which engaged in transport of Iranian petrochemical products as the commercial manager of the vessel ASTRA. The other two firms, Almanac Ship Management LLC and Al Anchor Ship Management FZE were involved in transport of Iranian petroleum products as the commercial manager of the vessels BERENICE PRIDE and PARINE respectively.\nIn July 2024, Samco Petroleum Energy FZE, located in Hamriyah Free Zone, was put up for sale for $17.7 million, with a promise to provide a turnkey oil trading operation. The sale emerged amidst the US sanctions imposed on several oil traders in the UAE's free trade zones, particularly Hamriyah, for continuing business with Iran and Russia. In November 2023, OFAC sanctioned a dozen companies in various UAE's free zones for facilitating the sale of Iranian products in third countries through Sepehr Energy, which is affiliated with Iran's Armed Forces General Staff. In March 2023, more companies operating in the UAE were sanctioned for exporting petrochemical products from Iran's Persian Gulf Petrochemical Industries to India and Southeast Asia. The Emirati authorities were also pushed to halt Russian imports and exports via Dubai.\nIn September 2024, the UAE and Australia agreed on a free trade deal, which was expected to increase investment in Australia's significant mineral and clean energy sectors. The deal was to eliminate tariffs on imports of over 99% of Australian goods. However, Australian unions criticized the deal, highlighting the UAE's poor human rights and labor record, including modern slavery under the kafala system. Michele O'Neil also expressed concerns regarding the exploitation of migrant workers in the UAE, calling it one of the most repressive regimes with which Australia has entered into a bilateral trade deal.\nHuman Resources and Employment.\nMany buildings were built primarily by workers from South Asia and East Asia. This is generally because the current generation of UAE locals prefer governmental jobs and not private sector employment. On 17 June 2008, there were about 7,500 skilled workers employed at the Burj Khalifa construction site. Press reports indicated in 2006 that skilled carpenters at the site earned \u00a34.34 a day, and labourers earned \u00a32.84. According to a BBC investigation and a Human Rights Watch report, the workers were housed in abysmal conditions, and worked long hours for low pay. During construction, only one construction-related death was reported. However, workplace injuries and fatalities in the UAE are \"poorly documented\", according to Human Rights Watch.\nIn March 2006 about 2,500 workers, upset over buses that were delayed for the end of their shifts, protested and triggered a riot, damaging cars, offices, computers and construction equipment. A Dubai Interior Ministry official said the rioters caused almost \u00a3500,000 in damage. Most of the workers involved in the riot returned the following day but refused to work. Workers at Dubai airport also protested.\nEmiratisation.\nEmiratisation is an initiative by the government of the UAE to employ more UAE Nationals in a meaningful and efficient manner in the public and private sectors. While the program has been in place for more than a decade and results can be seen in the public sector, the private sector is still lagging behind with citizens only representing 0.34% of the private sector workforce.\nWhile there is general agreement over the importance of Emiratisation for social, economic and political reasons, there is also some contention as to the impact of localization on organizational efficiency. It is yet unknown whether, and the extent to which, employment of nationals generates returns for MNEs operating in the Middle East. Recent research cautions that localization is not always advantageous for firms operating in the region, and its effectiveness depends on a number of contingent factors.\nIn December 2009 however, a positive impact of UAE citizens in the workplace was identified in a newspaper article citing a yet unpublished study, this advantage being the use of networks within the evolving power structures.\nOverall, however, uptake in the private sector remains low regardless of significant investments in education, which have reached record levels with education now accounting for 22.5% \u2013 or $2.6 billion \u2013 of the overall budget planned for 2010. Multiple governmental initiatives are actively promoting Emiratisation by training anyone from high school dropouts to graduates in a multitude of skills needed for the \u2013 essentially Western \u2013 work environment of the UAE, these initiatives include Tawteen UAE, ENDP or the Abu Dhabi Tawteen Council.\nThere are very few anti-discrimination laws in relation to labour issues, with Emiratis \u2013 and other GCC nationals \u2013 being given preference when it comes to employment. Unions are generally banned and workers with any labour issues are advised to be in touch with the Ministry of Labour, instead of protesting or refusing to work. Migrant employees often complain of poor workplace safety and wages based on nationality, although this is being slowly addressed.\nBeyond directly sponsoring educational initiatives, the Emirates Foundation for Philanthropy is funding major research initiatives into Emiratisation through competitive research grants, allowing universities such as United Arab Emirates University or Dubai School of Government to build and disseminate expertise on the topic.\nAcademics working on various aspects of Emiratisation include \"Paul Dyer\"[12] and \"Natasha Ridge\" from Dubai School of Government, \"Ingo Forstenlechner\"[13] from United Arab Emirates University, \"Kasim Randaree\" from the British University of Dubai and Paul Knoglinger from the FHWien.\nIn 2020, economy of the United Arab Emirates became vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic, witnessing an economic shutdown. Among the Emirates, Dubai was facing extreme situation, where the expat workers were left jobless. Thousands of the Britons working in the city started selling off their possessions to collect money, as the strict visa regulations forced them to return to the UK.\nAccording to an April 2021 report published by the Democracy Centre for Transparency on the \"Discrimination against foreigners and expatriates living in the UAE versus Emirati citizens\", despite labor reforms in the UAE, foreigners and skilled or unskilled migrant workers face discrimination and racialization from the citizens of the country. Foreigners and expatriates are often subjected to discrimination at work concerning promotions and wages, or gender inequality. The findings of the DCT concern the organization as the UAE's economy largely relies on foreign workers and thus fulfills a crucial international role. The organization demands that the UAE abide by universal human rights principles.\nThe 31st edition of World Report 2021 released by Human Rights Watch reiterates that labour abuses driven by an exploitative kafala system are persistent in the UAE. During the COVID-19 pandemic, migrant workers faced massive unemployment issues and were also left stranded in dire conditions without legal residencies. Also, many migrants suffered wage theft and were unable to pay rent or buy food.\nInvestment.\nThe stock market capitalization of listed companies in the UAE was valued at $109.9 billion in October 2012 by Bloomberg.\nOutward investment.\nA investment institutions were created by the government to promote manage investments made by the UAE abroad:\nAbu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA)\nCorporate Governance Code.\nThe Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA) introduced a new corporate governance regulation (the Corporate Governance Code), which applies to all joint stock companies and institutions whose securities are listed on Dubai Financial Market (DFM) and Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange (ADX) in 2009.\nBanking.\nOn 19 June 2020, rating agency Moody's changed its outlook regarding eight banks in the United Arab Emirates from stable to negative. The change was due to \"the potential material weakening in their standalone credit profiles\", where the UAE's economy was facing additional challenges amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and low oil prices. The eight banks included Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, Emirates NBD, HSBC Bank Middle East, Dubai Islamic Bank, Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank, National Bank of Fujairah, National Bank of Ras al-Khaimah and Mashreq Bank.\nThe Fitch Ratings in its 22 June 2020 report predicted that the Standalone Credit Profiles of UAE-based banks are to possibly weaken in the following year due to the COVID-19 pandemic and oil price collapse. As per the Fitch report, despite the implementation of timely measures for supporting the economy, the profitability of banks in the UAE are prone to get affected by a lower non-interest income worsened by a controlled business volume, lower interest rates, and higher loan recovery charges. In addition, the asset quality is expected to weaken, too, following the unbearable impact of the economic downturn that all borrowers may not be able to withstand.\nReal estate.\nThe development in the real estate and infrastructure sectors during the recent year has contributed in making the country a global touristic destination. The contribution of tourism in the Emirati GDP increased from 3% in the mid-1990s to more than 16.5% by the end of 2010. This trend is supported by the huge public investments in touristic projects (47 Billion Dollars per annum) carried mainly to expend airports, increase their capacity, set up new airports and ports.\nThe real estate sector have a positive impact on development, job opportunities, investments and tourism as estate projects were launched to meet the needs of market and the increasing demand for housing and commercial units especially in Dubai and Abu Dhabi.\nThe UAE has about 37% of the region's petroleum and gas industries, chemical industries, energy and water and garbage projects. The UAE's government have been injecting huge funds in tourism and real estate projects, especially in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. Al Saadiyat Island in Abu Dhabi and Burj Khalifa in Dubai, the tallest tower in the world, world central near \"Jebel Ali\" are a point in case of the milestones that have given the UAE its high profile of a global tourist destination. According to 2013\u20132014 Global Competitiveness Report, the UAE ranked fourth worldwide in terms of infrastructure quality.\nOn 28 November 2020, the Abu Dhabi Media Office announced that the government of United Arab Emirates, ahead of the 49th National Day, granted house loans, land and homes worth $2 billion (7.2 billion dirhams) to their citizens. The package is said to consist 3,099 plots, 2,000 house loans and 601 homes and exempting some families of the deceased citizens and retirees from the repayment of mortgage. The Director General of the Abu Dhabi Housing Society, Basheer Al Mehairbi said the initiative of providing sustainable housing aimed at ensuring a good standard of living for the citizens of the UAE.\nReal-estate projects.\nSome of the significant real-estate projects are:\nFinancial centers.\nAmong the most prominent financial centers in the UAE are:\nRegional GDP.\nData shown are for the year 2023 in nominal numbers.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31839", "revid": "48643156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31839", "title": "Telecommunications in the United Arab Emirates", "text": " \nTelecommunications in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is under the control and supervision of the Telecommunications and Digital Government Regulatory Authority which was established under UAE Federal Law by Decree No. 3 of 2003. From 1976 to 2006 the Emirates Telecommunications Corporation (Etisalat) was the sole telephone and telecommunications provider for the UAE. And while there were exceptions for free zones and modern housing developments, for the majority of the UAE, Etisalat held a monopoly on business and personal telecommunications services. In February 2006, this monopoly became a duopoly when a new telephone company and Internet service provider (ISP), du, was established to offer mobile services across the UAE and Internet and TV services to some free zone areas. However, due to geographical distribution of service areas, the companies do not compete for customers and thus effectively operate as monopolies. Earlier du provided triple play services to free zone areas under the name Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Company (EITC), which is still its legal name.\nRadio and television.\nRadio has been around for more than 60 years in the UAE. Prior to the UAE's formation, the British Forces Broadcasting Services (BFBC) had a local FM radio studio here. It ran syndicated entertainment programmes and read news about the command to it garrisons stationed in the then Trucial States.\nIn the late 1970s, UAE Radio started independent services. Channel 4 was the first commercial radio station, followed by Emirates Media Radio and the Arab Media Group. As of February 2014, independent radio stations in the UAE include 7 each in English and Hindi, 12 in Arabic, 4 Malayalam, and one each in Tamil, Tagalog, Russian and Persian.\nInternet censorship.\nAccording to Freedom House, Internet in the United Arab Emirates is significantly restricted: online censorship is rampant, the Emirati government surveils online activists and journalists and uses increasingly sophisticated technology to spread disinformation that advances pro-UAE domestic and international narratives on social media, and social media users in the UAE are arrested and fined for online posts.\nThe government bans websites that criticize it, as well as pornographic websites and those perceived as anti-Islamic or anti-government/anti-police.\nThe United Arab Emirates censors the Internet using Secure Computing's solution. The country's ISPs Etisalat and du (telco) ban pornography, politically sensitive material and anything against the perceived moral values of the UAE. All or most VoIP services are blocked. Both WhatsApp and Snapchat calling functions were also blocked in the UAE, to comply with VoIP regulations.\nTRA instructs Etisalat and du to block parts of Wikipedia, all VoIP services such as Skype and SIP based services and some social networking services like hi5, Friendster, and all dating sites like Yahoo! Personals and Match.com. A 2005 study, before du was established, also showed Etisalat sometimes block websites relating to the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith.\nA common method of circumventing internet censorship is by using VPN services. In March 2015, the Dubai Police declared the usage of VPN (virtual private network) illegal, saying that \"tampering with the internet is a crime\". Although action may not be taken against an individual for simply using a VPN, the usage of VPN combined with other illegal acts would lead to additional charges.\nIn March 2020, amid the COVID-19 outbreak, the government of UAE introduced a partial relaxation of the ban on VoIP services to ease communication during the lockdown. Popular instant messaging applications that remained blocked despite the removal of the ban on VoIP services included WhatsApp, FaceTime, and Skype. The selective relaxation of the ban narrowed down the user\u2019s choice to premium (paid) services, owned by state-run telecommunication firms.\nBroadcast media censorship.\nOn 16 November 2007, Tecom stopped broadcast of two major Pakistani satellite news channels, uplinked from Dubai Media City, which were initially marketed by Tecom under the tagline \"Freedom to Create\". The Dubai government ordered Tecom to shut down the popular independent Pakistani news channels Geo News and ARY One World on the demand of Pakistan's military regime led by General Pervez Musharraf. This was implemented by du Samacom, disabling their SDI and ASI streams. Later policymakers in Dubai permitted these channels to air their entertainment programs, but news, current affairs and political analysis were forbidden. Although subsequently the conditions were removed, marked differences have since been observed in their coverage. This incident has had a serious impact on all organizations in the media city, with Geo TV and ARY OneWorld considering relocation.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Many of these roads have been improved to become multi-lane dual-carriageway motorways, coping with the high demand for road transportation.\nThe UAE has a right hand traffic. Historically, the UAE had a left hand traffic until 1st September 1966.\nSpeed limits are on freeways (some freeway network's like E22 were imposed with a lower speed limit by the Abu Dhabi Government), on rural roads, and on urban dual-carriageways. Heavy trucks and buses are installed with speed limiters to prevent overspeeding.\nIn 2006, UAE had a score of 190 killed per million population in traffic collisions linked to high speeds and poor safety culture.\nIn 2010, UAE had a score near of 100 killed per million population in traffic collisions.\nIn 2013, UAE had a score near of 109 killed per million population in traffic collisions, as estimated by the WHO\nBetween 2014 and 2018 peopled killed by traffic has drop by 34%.\nTraffic in the United Arab Emirates.\nThe population of the UAE increased from 344,513 in 1971 to 9,591,853 in 2024. The Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure is responsible for maintaining highways and road connection between emirates. The highways and road infrastructure is monitored 24/7 by the ministry which utilizes Artificial Intelligence to monitor traffic. \nCurrent Traffic Congestion in Major Emirates.\nPeople spend 20 hours per week stuck in traffic (around 8.4% of their weekly time). Dubai emirate comes in first place with 1.44 million vehicles per emirate, followed by Abu Dhabi with 0.98 million vehicles, then Sharjah with 0.46 million vehicles. In contrast, the other emirates combined (Ajman, Umm Al Quwain, Fujairah, and Ras Al Khaimah) have around 0.63 million vehicles.\nDubai, being a globally recognized and go-to destination city with nearly 66.6 million visitors annually, has some challenges when it comes to traffic congestion between the two main roads that connect the other Emirates and the Dubai Emirate called: \u201cUAE road\u201d and \u201cMohammed Bin Zayed road\u201d. These roads play an important role in daily commuting because they act as a \"vital artery\", linking the emirates of the country to each other. Furthermore, these roads act as a traffic hub, contributing to facilitating traffic flow and the movement of transport between the Emirates.\nFactors that Contribute towards Traffic Congestion.\nSeveral factors contributed to the increased traffic congestion experienced by many drivers in the UAE over the past years, as follows:\nImpacts of Traffic Congestion on.\nEconomy.\nEach minute a car's engine is turned on while being stuck in traffic causes significant fuel consumption, with approximately 1.6 million liters of fuel being consumed annually, which results in an increased amount of money spent on fuel refills. \nEnvironment.\nYearly CO2 emissions due to traffic congestion reach 105 Kilograms of Carbon Dioxide released into the atmosphere, which leads to global warming. \nMajor accidents.\nSix people were killed, at least 40 were injured and dozens of vehicles burned March 11, 2008 when hundreds of cars collided on a fog-shrouded Abu Dhabi\u2013Dubai highway.\nBuses.\nBus services were introduced in Abu Dhabi by the Emirate in 2008 with four routes which were zero fare in their pilot year. At the end of 2011, bus services in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi provided more than 95 service routes with 650 buses to transport 50 million passengers in the region.

They consist of the UAE Army, UAE Navy, UAE Air Force, UAE Presidential Guard, UAE Joint Aviation Command, and the UAE National Guard.\nThey were nicknamed \"Little Sparta\", a nickname by former United States Marine Corps General and Secretary of Defense James Mattis, due to their active and effective military role and power projection in the surrounding region compared to their relative size.\nHistory.\nThe United Arab Emirates military was formed from the Trucial Oman Levies, which was established on 11 May 1951 and was renamed the Trucial Oman Scouts in 1956. The Trucial Oman Scouts was turned over to the United Arab Emirates as the nucleus of its defense forces in 1971 with the formation of UAE and was absorbed into a united military called the Union Defence Force (UDF). The Union Defence Force was established officially as the military of the United Arab Emirates on 27 December 1971 from a directive issued by Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan.\nAs the Union Defence Force, every emirate was responsible for the equipment and training of its defense forces. In the event of an attack on any one of the seven emirates, the Union Defence Force would be mobilized from every emirate to defend the emirate under attack. In 1974, the name was changed to the Federal Armed Forces. On 6 May 1976, the Federal Armed Forces were unified as a single body. May 6 is celebrated annually as the Military Union Day. As a result of the union of forces, the number of personnel formed a brigade and were referred to as the Yarmouk Brigade. After the union of the armed forces in 1976, the Yarmouk Brigade was officially renamed the United Arab Emirates Armed Forces. In 1976 the official UAE Armed Forces insignia, uniform, military academies, air force, and naval force were established and the military General Headquarters (GHQ) was formed in Abu Dhabi. UAE Armed Forces are equipped with weapon systems purchased from a variety of outside countries, including France, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Some officers are graduates of the United Kingdom's Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst, with others having attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, the Royal Military College, Duntroon, and St Cyr, the military academy of France.\nThe United Arab Emirates Armed Forces participated in multiple conflicts, including those in the Middle East. From 1977 to 1979, the UAE Army contributed 750 men to the Arab Deterrent Force peacekeeping mission in Lebanon. During 1990\u20131991, the Armed Forces participated in the first Gulf War. 10 UAE soldiers lost their lives in liberating Kuwait. UAE Armed Forces were deployed in Eastern Europe and joined NATO's Kosovo Force peacekeeping mission, undertaking aid missions to thousands of fleeing refugees on the Albanian border. This was the first time the UAE troops' uniform was switched to the woodland camouflage compared to their home desert camouflage. UAE Armed Forces participated in the peacekeeping mission in Somalia from 1993-94. The UAE Presidential Guards were deployed to maintain security in War in Afghanistan against the Taliban. In March 2011, UAE joined the enforcement of the no-fly-zone over Libya by sending six F-16 and six Mirage 2000 multi-role fighter aircraft and in 2015 joined the Saudi-led coalition intervention in Yemen by sending 30 UAEAF F16 Desert Falcons to Yemen. The intervention was followed by UAE ground troops in Southern Yemen, focusing on targeting \"terrorist\" cells such as Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and Islamic State.\nUAE introduced a mandatory military conscription of 16 months for adult males in 2014 to expand its reserve force. The date of the first death in the line of duty of a UAE soldier was on 30 November 1971 during the Seizure of Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs which is celebrated annually as the Commemoration Day. The largest loss of life in the history of the UAE military occurred on Friday, 4 September 2015, when 52 soldiers were killed in the Marib area of Yemen by an Tochka missile that targeted a weapons cache and caused an explosion. Names of UAE soldiers who died in the line of duty are inscribed in the UAE Armed Forces memorial, the Oasis of Dignity, in Abu Dhabi.\nThe UAE outsourced much of its military to foreign mercenaries and advisers. A report released in October 2022 revealed that several retired US military personnel work as military contractors or consultants for the UAE. The report obtained through the Freedom of Information Act revealed that in seven years, nearly 280 American military veterans sought federal permission to work for the Emirates. Hundreds of US military veterans were also known to have been hired by the UAE government or state-owned firms. Experts claimed that the Emirati military was the Arab world's most powerful due to the influx of American veterans. UAE ambassador to the US, Yousef Al Otaiba, said the US played a crucial role in the Emirates' progress and security. However, the extent of Emirati dependence on US military contractors is not fully known.\nBranches.\nArmy.\nAs part of the military of the United Arab Emirates, the Army (called Land Forces in Arabic) is responsible for land and ground-based operations.\nNavy.\nThe United Arab Emirates Navy consisted of more than 2,000 personnel and 72 vessels.\nAir Force.\nThe United Arab Emirates Air Force has about 4,000 personnel as of 2017. The air force agreed in 1999 to purchase 80 US F-16 multirole fighter aircraft. Next to that, they included other equipment such as 60 Mirage 2000s, British Hawk aircraft, and French helicopters. The air defense has a Hawk missile program for which the United States has been providing training. The UAE has taken delivery of two out of five Triad I-Hawk batteries.\nPresidential Guard.\nThe United Arab Emirates Presidential Guard (UAE-PG) was formed in 2011 by merging the Amiri Guard, Special Operations Command, and the Marine Battalion from the UAE Navy. UAE requested that training support be provided by the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC). The U.S. State Department approved a foreign military sales (FMS) Training Case for UAE-PG in October 2011. Marine Corps Training Mission UAE (MCTM-UAE) operates under chief of mission authority as a Title 22 FMS training case.\nDeployments.\nGulf War.\nUAE sent forces to assist Kuwait during the 1990\u20131991 Gulf War where some hundred UAE troops participated in the conflict as part of the GCC Peninsula Shield force that advanced into Kuwait City. UAE air force carried out strikes against Iraqi forces. UAE Armed Forces participated in the coalition with an army battalion along with a squadron of Dassault Mirage 5 and Mirage 2000. 6 UAE troops were killed in action.\nUnited Nations Operation in Somalia II.\nUAE Armed Forces participated in UNOSOM II, which was an intervention launched in March 1993 until March 1995, and committed resources to the United Nations mission.\nLebanon.\nUAE Military field engineers arrived in Lebanon on 8 September 2007 in Beirut to clear areas of south Lebanon from mines and cluster bombs.\nWar in Afghanistan.\nUAE Armed Forces were deployed in 2003 to Afghanistan, mainly to support construction. UAE special forces would establish fire support base around UAE-supported projects which included funding tarmac roads, clinics, a Pashtun radio station, and a mast provided by e&amp;(formerly Etisalat) which provided competition for other mobile networks in Helmand. Their activities include driving into \"remote and impoverished\" Afghan villages, distributing aid and sitting down with the village \"elders\" to inquire about their needs. They would then fund projects while the contracts went out to local tender. UAE Armed Forces used their ties to Islam and ability to fund projects to try to reduce the local suspicion of NATO in Afghanistan.\nSaudi-led intervention in Yemen.\nIn 2015, the UAE participated in the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen to influence the outcome of the Yemeni Civil War (2015\u2013). During this war, Emirati special forces conducted an amphibious assault on Aden, which, according to the Economist, impressed observers in the West. On 4 September 2015, 52 UAE soldiers (together with 10 Saudi and 5 Bahraini soldiers) were killed when a Houthi missile hit an ammunition dump at a military base in Ma'rib Governorate, marking the \"highest death toll on the battlefield in the country's history\".\nIn 2016, during the Battle of Mukalla, UAE Armed Forces liberated the port of Mukalla from AQAP forces in 36 hours after being held by AQAP for more than a year with the US defense secretary James Mattis calling the UAE led operation a model for American troops. In 2018, the Associated Press in a report mentioned that UAE struck deals with AQAP militants by recruiting them against fighting the Houthis and providing them with money. The report continued to state that the United States was aware of Al-Qaeda joining ranks with UAE and has held off drone strikes against Al-Qaeda. UAE Brigadier General Musallam Al Rashidi responded to the report by stating that Al Qaeda cannot be reasoned with in the first place stating that \"There's no point in negotiating with these guys.\" The UAE military stated that accusations of allowing AQAP to leave with cash contradict its primary objective of depriving AQAP of its financial strength. The notion of Al Qaeda joining ranks with UAE Armed Forces and the United States holding off drone strikes against Al Qaeda has been denied by The Pentagon with Colonel Robert Manning, spokesperson of the Pentagon, calling the news source \"patently false\". According to The Independent, AQAP activity on social media as well as the number of reported attacks conducted by it has decreased since UAE intervention.\nOn 30 April 2018 the UAE armed forces, as part of the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen, landed troops on the island of Socotra. The Independent newspaper reported that UAE has politically annexed the island and built a communications network, and conducted census and provided Socotra residents with free healthcare and work permits in Abu Dhabi. On 14 May 2018, a deal was brokered between UAE and Yemen for a joint military training exercise and the return of administrative control of Socotra's airport and seaport to Yemen.\nIn June 2018, an offensive was carried out by UAE-led troops in Hodeidah. In June 2019, the UAE announced a partial withdrawal of its troops by reducing armed forces fighting in Yemen. An official from the UAE called the move a \"strategic\" redeployment. According to a Reuters report, the Gulf nation ordered the withdrawal of its troops following security concerns, after tensions with Iran. UAE stated that it is shifting its focus from Houthi rebels to ISIS and al-Qaeda in Yemen.\nIslamic State.\nIn 2015, the UAE Air Force dropped bombs on Islamic State targets in Syria. One of them was Major Mariyam Al Mansouri, the first female UAE Air Force pilot.\nSomalia.\nUAE forces have been assisting the military of Somalia against al-Shabaab (militant group) forces in the country. In February 2024, three UAE soldiers were killed in an attack, there.\nExpansion.\nIn 1989, the UAE purchased Scud-B ballistic missiles from North Korea. UAE went on an expansion drive in 1995, which began with the 1992\u201393 acquisition of 436 Leclerc tanks and 415 BMP-3 armored vehicles. It had learned from the Iranian experiences with having a single supplier for its military and has diversified its arms purchases, purchasing weaponry mainly from Russia, the United States, the UK, Ukraine, France, Italy and Germany. It has also taken care to invest in the systems it has purchased and standardize them according to NATO/GCC Specifications. The equipment purchases were also followed by a program to increase manpower numbers and Emiratisation program for the Armed forces.\nIn 2008, UAE bought MIM-104 Patriot missiles and related radar, support services for the Patriot systems.\nIn 2011, during a war scare with Iran over the Straits of Hormuz, the UAE announced a purchase of US$3.48 billion worth of American missile systems: 2 radar systems, 96 missiles, spare parts, and training. UAE was the first country to acquire the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense System (THAAD). A contract worth $1.96 billion was agreed for Lockheed Martin Corp to supply two THAAD anti-missile batteries.\nIn November 2019, South Africa blocked the supply of arms to United Arab Emirates, Oman, Algeria, and Saudi Arabia following a dispute in the inspection clause of its agreement. According to a report by Reuters, the UAE and the other mentioned countries refused to allow officials from South Africa to inspect their facilities. The dispute arose as the UAE and the other countries refused the inspections, stating that they violated their sovereignty. According to the industry, the inspection row puts business at risk and could cause the loss of up to 9,000 jobs at defense firms and supporting industries in South Africa. UAE began firing trials with China, India, and Serbia to replace the South African RDM as the preferred supplier of ammunition.\nIndustry.\nThe Abu Dhabi Ship Building (ADSB) produces a range of ships and is a contractor in the Baynunah Programme, a program to design, develop, and produce 5\u20136 corvettes customized for operation in the waters of the Persian Gulf. It has produced ammunition, military transport vehicles, and unmanned aerial vehicles. A joint venture agreement was signed in Abu Dhabi on 28 November 2007 between Tawazun Holding LLC, an investment company established by the Offset Program Bureau (OPB), Al-Jaber Trading Establishment, part of Al-Jaber Group, and Rheinmetall Munitions Systems, to set up the Al-Burkan munition factory at the Zayed Military City in Abu Dhabi. OPB signed four Memorandums of Understanding with companies from Europe and Singapore at the Paris Eurosatory 2008 defense exhibition on June 20, Rheinmetall Group and Diehl Defence Holding of Germany, Singapore Technologies Engineering (ST Engineering), and Thales of France. Tawazun has partnered with Saab on radar development.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
