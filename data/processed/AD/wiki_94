He was the second of three sons; firstborn Alfred died in infancy, and younger brother Herbert Maurice (or Millsap) was born in 1916. Lewis Alfred Ellison, a small-business owner and a construction foreman, died in 1916, after work-related injury and a failed operation. The elder Ellison loved literature, and doted on his children. Ralph later discovered, as an adult, that his father had hoped he would grow up to be a poet.\nIn 1921, Ellison's mother and her children moved to Gary, Indiana, where she had a brother. According to Ellison, his mother felt that \"my brother and I would have a better chance of reaching manhood if we grew up in the north.\" When she did not find a job and her brother lost his, the family returned to Oklahoma, where Ellison worked as a busboy, a shoeshine boy, hotel waiter, and a dentist's assistant. From the father of a neighborhood friend, he received free lessons for playing trumpet and alto saxophone, and would go on to become the school bandmaster.\nIda remarried three times after Lewis died. However, the family life was precarious, and Ralph worked various jobs during his youth and teens to assist with family support. While attending Douglass High School, he also found time to play on the school's football team. He graduated from high school in 1931. He worked for a year, and found the money to make a down payment on a trumpet, using it to play with local musicians, and to take further music lessons. At Douglass, he was influenced by principal Inman E. Page and his daughter, music teacher Zelia N. Breaux.\nAt Tuskegee Institute.\nEllison applied twice for admission to Tuskegee Institute, the prestigious all-black university in Alabama founded by Booker T. Washington. He was finally admitted in 1933 for lack of a trumpet player in its orchestra. Ellison hopped freight trains to get to Alabama, and was soon to find out that the institution was no less class-conscious than white institutions generally were.\nEllison's outsider position at Tuskegee \"sharpened his satirical lens,\" critic Hilton Als believes: \"Standing apart from the university's air of sanctimonious Negritude enabled him to write about it.\" In passages of \"Invisible Man\", \"he looks back with scorn and despair on the snivelling ethos that ruled at Tuskegee.\"\nTuskegee's music department was perhaps the most renowned department at the school, headed by composer William L. Dawson. Ellison also was guided by the department's piano instructor, Hazel Harrison. While he studied music primarily in his classes, he spent his free time in the library with modernist classics. He cited reading T. S. Eliot's \"The Waste Land\" as a major awakening moment. In 1934, he began to work as a desk clerk at the university library, where he read James Joyce and Gertrude Stein. Librarian Walter Bowie Williams enthusiastically let Ellison share in his knowledge.\nA major influence upon Ellison was English teacher Morteza Drexel Sprague, to whom Ellison later dedicated his essay collection \"Shadow and Act\". He opened Ellison's eyes to \"the possibilities of literature as a living art\" and to \"the glamour he would always associate with the literary life.\" Through Sprague, Ellison became familiar with Fyodor Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" and Thomas Hardy's \"Jude the Obscure\", identifying with the \"brilliant, tortured anti-heroes\" of those works.\nAs a child, Ellison evidenced what would become a lifelong interest in audio technology, starting by taking apart and rebuilding radios, and later moving on to constructing and customizing elaborate hi-fi stereo systems as an adult. He discussed this passion in a December 1955 essay, \"Living With Music\", in \"High Fidelity\" magazine. Ellison scholar John S. Wright contends that this deftness with the ins-and-outs of electronic devices went on to inform Ellison's approach to writing and the novel form. Ellison remained at Tuskegee until 1936, and decided to leave before completing the requirements for a degree.\nIn New York.\nDesiring to study sculpture, he moved to New York City on July 5, 1936, and found lodging at a YMCA on 135th Street in Harlem, then \"the culture capital of black America\". He met Langston Hughes, \"Harlem's unofficial diplomat\" of the Depression era, and someone\u2014as one of the country's celebrity black authors\u2014who could live from his writing. Hughes introduced him to the black literary establishment with Communist sympathies.\nEllison met several artists who would influence his later life, including the artist Romare Bearden and the author Richard Wright (with whom he would have a long and complicated relationship). After Ellison wrote a book review for Wright, Wright encouraged him to write fiction as a career. Ellison's first published story was \"Hymie's Bull\", inspired by his 1933 hoboing on a train with his uncle to get to Tuskegee. From 1937 to 1944, Ellison had more than 20 book reviews, as well as short stories and articles, published in magazines such as \"New Challenge\" and \"The New Masses\". \nEllison was also influenced to experiment with photography through his friendship with photographer Gordon Parks. The two collaborated on a photo essay in 1948, \"Harlem is Nowhere\", on the first racially integrated psychiatric clinic called Lafargue Clinic in Harlem, along with other photography projects over the years. Ellison's essay \"The Pictorial Problem\" was meant to be a manifesto of how images could psychologically impact the viewer. While working with Gordon Parks, Ellison was an inspiration to Gordon on creating impactful photographs. Ellison's essay would later become a guiding principle for Parks's photography.\nWright was then openly associated with the Communist Party, and Ellison was publishing and editing for communist publications, although his \"affiliation was quieter\", according to historian Carol Polsgrove in \"Divided Minds\". Both Wright and Ellison lost their faith in the Communist Party during World War II, when they felt the party had betrayed African Americans and replaced Marxist class politics with social reformism. In a letter to Wright, dated August 18, 1945, Ellison poured out his anger with party leaders: \"If they want to play ball with the bourgeoisie they needn't think they can get away with it.\u00a0... Maybe we can't smash the atom, but we can, with a few well chosen, well written words, smash all that crummy filth to hell.\" In the wake of this disillusion, Ellison began writing \"Invisible Man\", a novel that was, in part, his response to the party's betrayal.\nIn 1938, Ellison met Rose Araminta Poindexter, a woman two years his senior. She was an actress, starring in films such as \"The Upright Sinner\" (1931). Poindexter and Ellison were married in late 1938. Poindexter continued her career as a stage actress after their marriage. In biographer Arnold Rampersad's assessment of Ellison's taste in women, he was searching for one \"physically attractive and smart who would love, honor, and obey him\u2014but not challenge his intellect.\" At first they lived at 312 West 122nd Street, Rose's apartment, but moved to 453 West 140th Street after her income shrank. In 1941, he briefly had an affair with Sanora Babb, which he confessed to his wife afterwards, and in 1943 the marriage was over. The couple officially divorced in 1945. As of April 2023, Poindexter remains alive at 111 years old.\nAt the start of World War II, Ellison was classed 1A by the local Selective Service System, and thus eligible for the draft. However, he was not drafted. Toward the end of the war, he enlisted in the United States Merchant Marine. In 1946, he married Fanny McConnell, an accomplished person in her own right: a scholarship graduate of the University of Iowa who was a founder of the Negro People's Theater in Chicago and a writer for \"The Chicago Defender\". While he wrote \"Invisible Man\", she helped support Ellison financially by working for American Medical Center for Burma Frontiers (the charity supporting Gordon S. Seagrave's medical missionary work). In 1946, Ellison composed and wrote the lyrics for at least two songs, \"Flirty\" and \"It Would Only Hurt Me If I Knew\". From 1947 to 1951, he earned some money writing book reviews but spent most of his time working on \"Invisible Man\". Fanny also helped type Ellison's longhand text and assisted him in editing the typescript as it progressed.\nPublished in 1952, \"Invisible Man\" explores the theme of a person's search for their identity and place in society, as seen from the perspective of the first-person narrator, an unnamed African-American man, first in the Deep South and then in the New York City of the 1930s. In contrast to his contemporaries such as Richard Wright and James Baldwin, Ellison created characters that are dispassionate, educated, articulate, and self-aware. Through the protagonist, Ellison explores the contrasts between the Northern and Southern varieties of racism and their alienating effect. The narrator is \"invisible\" in a figurative sense, in that \"people refuse to see\" him, and also experiences a kind of dissociation. The novel also contains taboo issues such as incest and the controversial subject of communism.\nLater years.\nIn 1962, the futurist Herman Kahn recruited Ellison as a consultant to the Hudson Institute in an attempt to broaden its scope beyond defense-related research.\nIn 1964, Ellison published \"Shadow and Act\", a collection of essays, and began to teach at Bard College, Rutgers University and Yale University, while continuing to work on his novel. The following year, a Book Week poll of 200 critics, authors, and editors was released that proclaimed \"Invisible Man\" the most important novel since World War II.\nIn 1967, Ellison experienced a major house fire at his summer home in Plainfield, Massachusetts, in which he claimed more than 300 pages of his second novel manuscript were lost. A perfectionist regarding the art of the novel, Ellison had said in accepting his National Book Award for \"Invisible Man\" that he felt he had made \"an attempt at a major novel\" and, despite the award, he was unsatisfied with the book. Ellison ultimately wrote more than 2,000 pages of this second novel but never finished it.\nEllison died on April 16, 1994, of pancreatic cancer and was interred in a crypt at Trinity Church Cemetery and Mausoleum in the Hamilton Heights neighborhood of Upper Manhattan.\nAwards and recognition.\n\"Invisible Man\" won the 1953 US National Book Award for Fiction.\nThe award was his ticket into the American literary establishment. He eventually was admitted to the American Academy of Arts and Letters, received two President's Medals (from Lyndon Johnson and Ronald Reagan) and a State Medal from France. He was the first African-American admitted to the Century Association and was awarded an honorary Doctorate from Harvard University. Disillusioned by his experience with the Communist Party, he used his new fame to speak out for literature as a moral instrument. In 1955 he traveled to Europe, visiting and lecturing, settling for a time in Rome, where he wrote an essay that appeared in a 1957 Bantam anthology called \"A New Southern Harvest\". Robert Penn Warren was in Rome during the same period, and the two writers became close friends. Later, Warren would interview Ellison about his thoughts on race, history, and the Civil Rights Movement for his book \"Who Speaks for the Negro?\" In 1958, Ellison returned to the United States to take a position teaching American and Russian literature at Bard College and to begin a second novel, \"Juneteenth\". During the 1950s, he corresponded with his lifelong friend, the writer Albert Murray. In their letters they commented on the development of their careers, the Civil Rights Movement, and other common interests including jazz. Much of this material was published in the collection \"Trading Twelves\" (2000).\nWriting essays about both the black experience and his love for jazz music, Ellison continued to receive major awards for his work. In 1969, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom; the following year, he was made a Chevalier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by France and became a permanent member of the faculty at New York University as the Albert Schweitzer Professor of Humanities, serving from 1970 to 1980.\nIn 1975, Ellison was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and his hometown of Oklahoma City honored him with the dedication of the Ralph Waldo Ellison Library. Continuing to teach, Ellison published mostly essays, and in 1984, he received the New York City College's Langston Hughes Medal. In 1985, he was awarded the National Medal of Arts. In 1986, his \"Going to the Territory\" was published; this is a collection of seventeen essays that included insight into southern novelist William Faulkner and Ellison's friend Richard Wright, as well as the music of Duke Ellington and the contributions of African Americans to America's national identity.\nIn 1992, Ellison was awarded a special achievement award from the Anisfield-Wolf Book Awards; his artistic achievements included work as a sculptor, musician, photographer, and college professor as well as his writing output. He taught at Bard College, Rutgers University, the University of Chicago, and New York University. Ellison was also a charter member of the Fellowship of Southern Writers.\nLegacy and posthumous publications.\nAfter Ellison's death, more manuscripts were discovered in his home, resulting in the publication of \"Flying Home and Other Stories\" in 1996. In 1999, his second novel, \"Juneteenth\", was published under the editorship of John F. Callahan, a professor at Lewis &amp; Clark College and Ellison's literary executor. It was a 368-page condensation of more than 2,000 pages written by Ellison over a period of 40 years. All the manuscripts of this incomplete novel were published collectively on January 26, 2010, by Modern Library, under the title \"Three Days Before the Shooting...\"\nOn February 18, 2014, the USPS issued a 91\u00a2 stamp honoring Ralph Ellison in its Literary Arts series.\nA park on 150th Street and Riverside Drive in Harlem (near 730 Riverside Drive, Ellison's principal residence from the early 1950s until his death) was dedicated to Ellison on May 1, 2003. In the park stands a 15 by 8-foot bronze slab with a \"cut-out man figure\" inspired by his book \"Invisible Man\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Much of his literature concerns racial themes, especially related to the plight of African Americans during the late 19th to mid 20th centuries suffering discrimination and violence. His best known works include the novella collection \"Uncle Tom's Children\" (1938), the novel \"Native Son\" (1940), and the memoir \"Black Boy\" (1945). Literary critics believe his work helped change race relations in the United States in the mid-20th century.\nEarly life and education.\nChildhood in the US South.\nRichard Nathaniel Wright was born on September 4, 1908, at Rucker's Plantation, between the train town of Roxie and the larger river city of Natchez, Mississippi. He was the son of Nathan Wright, a sharecropper, and Ella (Wilson), a schoolteacher. His parents were born free after the Civil War; both sets of his grandparents had been born into slavery and freed as a result of the war. Each of his grandfathers had taken part in the U.S. Civil War and gained freedom through service: his paternal grandfather, Nathan Wright, had served in the 28th United States Colored Troops; his maternal grandfather, Richard Wilson, escaped from slavery in the South to serve in the U.S. Navy as a Landsman in April 1865.\nRichard's father left the family when Richard was six years old, and he did not see Richard for 25 years. In 1911 or 1912, Ella moved to Natchez, Mississippi, to be with her parents. While living in his grandparents' home, he accidentally set the house on fire. Wright's mother was so angry that she beat him until he was unconscious. In 1915, Ella put her sons in Settlement House, a Methodist orphanage, for a short time. He was enrolled at Howe Institute in Memphis, Tennessee, from 1915 to 1916. In 1916, his mother moved with Richard and his younger brother to live with her sister Maggie (Wilson) and Maggie's husband Silas Hoskins (born 1882) in Elaine, Arkansas. This part of Arkansas was in the Mississippi Delta, where former cotton plantations had been. The Wrights were forced to flee after Silas Hoskins \"disappeared\", reportedly killed by a white man who coveted his successful saloon business. After his mother became incapacitated by a stroke, Richard was separated from his younger brother and lived briefly with his uncle Clark Wilson and aunt Jodie in Greenwood, Mississippi. At the age of 12, Richard had not yet had a single complete year of schooling.\nSoon Richard with his younger brother and mother returned to the home of his maternal grandmother, which was now in the state capital, Jackson, Mississippi, where he lived from early 1920 until late 1925. His grandparents, still angry at him for destroying their house, repeatedly beat Wright and his brother. But while he lived there, he was finally able to attend school regularly. He attended the local Seventh-day Adventist school from 1920 to 1921, with his aunt Addie as his teacher. After a year, at the age of 13 he entered the Jim Hill public school in 1921, where he was promoted to sixth grade after only two weeks.\nIn his grandparents' Seventh-day Adventist home, Richard was miserable, largely because his controlling aunt and grandmother tried to force him to pray so he might build a relationship with God. Wright later threatened to move out of his grandmother's home when she would not allow him to work on the Adventist Sabbath, Saturday. His aunt's and grandparents' overbearing attempts to control him caused him to carry over hostility towards Biblical and Christian teachings to solve life's problems. This theme would weave through his writings throughout his life.\nAt the age of 15, while in eighth grade, Wright published his first story, \"The Voodoo of Hell's Half-Acre\", in the local Black newspaper \"Southern Register.\" No copies survive. In Chapter 7 of \"Black Boy\", he described the story as about a villain who sought a widow's home.\nIn 1923, after excelling in grade school and junior high, Wright earned the position of class valedictorian of Smith Robertson Junior High School from which he graduated in May 1925. He was assigned to write a speech to be delivered at graduation in a public auditorium. Before graduation day, he was called to the principal's office, where the principal gave him a prepared speech to present in place of his own. Richard challenged the principal, saying: \"[T]he people are coming to hear the students, and I won't make a speech that you've written.\" The principal threatened him, suggesting that Richard might not be allowed to graduate if he persisted, despite his having passed all the examinations. He also tried to entice Richard with an opportunity to become a teacher. Determined not to be called an Uncle Tom, Richard refused to deliver the principal's address, written to avoid offending the white school district officials. He was able to convince everyone to allow him to read the words he had written himself.\nIn September that year, Wright registered for mathematics, English, and history courses at the new Lanier High School, constructed for black students in Jackson\u2014the state's schools were segregated under its Jim Crow laws\u2014but he had to stop attending classes after a few weeks of irregular attendance because he needed to earn money to support his family.\nIn November 1925, at the age of 17, Wright moved on his own to Memphis, Tennessee. There, he fed his appetite for reading. His hunger for books was so great that Wright devised a successful ploy to borrow books from the segregated white library. Using a library card lent by a white coworker, which he presented with forged notes that claimed he was picking up books for the white man, Wright was able to obtain and read books forbidden to black people in the Jim Crow South. This stratagem also allowed him access to publications such as \"Harper's\", the \"Atlantic Monthly\", and \"The American Mercury\".\nHe planned to have his mother come and live with him once he could support her, and in 1926, his mother and younger brother did rejoin him. Shortly thereafter, Richard resolved to leave the Jim Crow South and go to Chicago. His family joined the Great Migration, when tens of thousands of blacks left the South to seek opportunities in the more economically prosperous northern and mid-western industrial cities.\nWright's childhood in Mississippi, Tennessee, and Arkansas shaped his lasting impressions of American racism.\nComing of age in Chicago.\nWright and his family moved to Chicago in 1927, where he secured employment as a United States postal clerk. He used his time in between shifts to study other writers including H. L. Mencken, whose vision of the American South as a version of Hell made an impression. When he lost his job there during the Great Depression, Wright was forced to go on relief in 1931. In 1932, he began attending meetings of the John Reed Club, a Marxist literary organization. Wright established relationships and networked with party members. Wright formally joined the Communist Party and the John Reed Club in late 1933 at the urging of his friend Abraham Aaron. As a revolutionary poet, he wrote proletarian poems (\"We of the Red Leaves of Red Books\", for example), for \"New Masses\" and other communist-leaning periodicals. A power struggle within the Chicago chapter of the John Reed Club had led to the dissolution of the club's leadership; Wright was told he had the support of the club's party members if he was willing to join the party.\nIn 1933, Wright founded the South Side Writers Group, whose members included Arna Bontemps and Margaret Walker. Through the group and his membership in the John Reed Club, Wright founded and edited \"Left Front\", a literary magazine. Wright began publishing his poetry (\"A Red Love Note\" and \"Rest for the Weary\", for example) there in 1934. There is dispute about the demise in 1935 of \"Left Front Magazine\" as Wright blamed the Communist Party despite his protests. It is, however, likely due to the proposal at the 1934 Midwest Writers Congress that the John Reed Club be replaced by a Communist Party-sanctioned First American Party Congress. Throughout this period, Wright continued to contribute to \"New Masses\" magazine, revealing the path his writings would ultimately take.\nBy 1935, Wright had completed the manuscript of his first novel, \"Cesspool\", which was rejected by eight publishers and published posthumously as \"Lawd Today\" (1963). This first work featured autobiographical anecdotes about working at a post office in Chicago during the Great Depression.\nIn January 1936, his story \"Big Boy Leaves Home\" was accepted for publication in the anthology \"New Caravan\" and the anthology \"Uncle Tom's Children\", focusing on black life in the rural American South.\nIn February of that year, he began working with the National Negro Congress (NNC), speaking at the Chicago convention on \"The Role of the Negro Artist and Writer in the Changing Social Order\". His ultimate goal (looking at other labor unions as inspiration) was the development of NNC-sponsored publications, exhibits, and conferences alongside the Federal Writers' Project to get work for black artists.\nIn 1937, he became the Harlem editor of the \"Daily Worker\". This assignment compiled quotes from interviews preceded by an introductory paragraph, thus allowing him time for other pursuits like the publication of \"Uncle Tom's Children\" a year later.\nPleased by his positive relations with white Communists in Chicago, Wright was later humiliated in New York City by some white party members who rescinded an offer to find housing for him when they learned his race. Some black Communists denounced Wright as a \"bourgeois intellectual\". Wright was essentially autodidactic. He had been forced to end his public education to support his mother and brother after completing junior high school.\nThroughout the Soviet pact with Nazi Germany in 1940, Wright continued to focus his attention on racism in the United States. He would ultimately break from the Communist Party when they broke from a tradition against segregation and racism and joined Stalinists supporting the US entering World War II in 1941.\nWright insisted that young communist writers be given space to cultivate their talents. He later described this episode through his fictional character Buddy Nealson, an African-American communist, in his essay \"I tried to be a Communist\", published in the \"Atlantic Monthly\" in 1944. This text was an excerpt of his autobiography scheduled to be published as \"American Hunger\" but was removed from the actual publication of \"Black Boy\" upon request by the Book of the Month Club. Indeed, his relations with the party turned violent; Wright was threatened at knifepoint by fellow-traveler co-workers, denounced as a Trotskyite in the street by strikers, and physically assaulted by former comrades when he tried to join them during the 1936 Labour Day march.\nCareer.\nIn Chicago in 1932, Wright began writing with the Federal Writer's Project and became a member of the American Communist Party. In 1937, he relocated to New York and became the Bureau Chief of the communist publication, the \"Daily Worker\". He would write more than 200 articles for the publication from 1937 to 1938. This allowed him to cover stories and issues that interested him, revealing depression-era America into light with well-written prose.\nHe worked on the Federal Writers' Project guidebook to the city, \"New York Panorama\" (1938), and wrote the book's essay on Harlem. Through the summer and fall, Wright wrote more than 200 articles for the \"Daily Worker\" and helped edit a short-lived literary magazine, \"New Challenge\". The year was also a landmark for him because he met and developed a friendship with writer Ralph Ellison that would last for years. Wright was awarded the \"Story\" magazine first prize of $500 for his short story \"Fire and Cloud\".\nAfter receiving the \"Story\" prize in early 1938, Wright shelved his manuscript of \"Lawd Today\" and dismissed his literary agent, John Troustine. He hired Paul Reynolds, the well-known agent of poet Paul Laurence Dunbar, to represent him. Meanwhile, the Story Press offered the publisher Harper all of Wright's prize-entry stories for a book, and Harper agreed to publish the collection.\nWright gained national attention for the collection of four short stories entitled \"Uncle Tom's Children\" (1938). He based some stories on lynching in the Deep South. The publication and favorable reception of \"Uncle Tom's Children\" improved Wright's status with the Communist Party and enabled him to establish a reasonable degree of financial stability. He was appointed to the editorial board of \"New Masses\". Granville Hicks, a prominent literary critic and Communist sympathizer, introduced him at leftist teas in Boston. By May 6, 1938, excellent sales had provided Wright with enough money to move to Harlem, where he began writing the novel \"Native Son\", which was published in 1940.\nBased on his collected short stories, Wright applied for and was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, which gave him a stipend allowing him to complete \"Native Son.\" During this period, he rented a room in the home of friends Herbert and Jane Newton, an interracial couple and prominent Communists whom Wright had known in Chicago. They had moved to New York and lived at 109 Lefferts Place in Brooklyn, in the Fort Greene neighborhood.\nAfter publication, \"Native Son\" was selected by the Book of the Month Club as its first book by an African-American author. It was a daring choice. The lead character, Bigger Thomas, is bound by the limitations that society places on African Americans. Unlike most in this situation, he gains his own agency and self-knowledge only by committing heinous acts. Wright's characterization of Bigger led to him being criticized for his concentration on violence in his works. In the case of \"Native Son\", people complained that he portrayed a black man in ways that seemed to confirm whites' worst fears. The period following publication of \"Native Son\" was a busy time for Wright. In July 1940, he went to Chicago to do research for a folk history of blacks to accompany photographs selected by Edwin Rosskam. While in Chicago, he visited the American Negro Exposition with Langston Hughes, Arna Bontemps and Claude McKay.\nWright traveled to Chapel Hill, North Carolina, to collaborate with playwright Paul Green on a dramatic adaptation of \"Native Son.\" In January 1941 Wright received the prestigious Spingarn Medal of the NAACP for noteworthy achievement. His play \"Native Son\" opened on Broadway in March 1941, with Orson Welles as director, to generally favorable reviews. Wright also wrote the text to accompany a volume of photographs chosen by Rosskam, which were almost completely drawn from the files of the Farm Security Administration. The FSA had employed top photographers to travel around the country and capture images of Americans. Their collaboration, \"12 Million Black Voices: A Folk History of the Negro in the United States\", was published in October 1941 to wide critical acclaim.\nWright's memoir \"Black Boy\" (1945) describes his early life from Roxie up until his move to Chicago at the age of 19. It includes his clashes with his Seventh-day Adventist family, his troubles with white employers, and social isolation. It also describes his intellectual journey through these struggles. \"American Hunger\", which was published posthumously in 1977, was originally intended by Wright as the second volume of \"Black Boy\". The Library of America edition of 1991 finally restored the book to its original two-volume form.\n\"American Hunger\" details Wright's participation in the John Reed Clubs and the Communist Party, which he left in 1942. The book implies he left earlier, but he did not announce his withdrawal until 1944. In the book's restored form, Wright used the diptych structure to compare the certainties and intolerance of organized communism, which condemned \"bourgeois\" books and certain members, with similar restrictive qualities of fundamentalist organized religion. Wright disapproved of Joseph Stalin's Great Purge in the Soviet Union.\nMove to France, later life and death.\nFollowing a stay of a few months in Qu\u00e9bec, Canada, including a lengthy stay in the village of Sainte-P\u00e9tronille on the \u00cele d'Orl\u00e9ans, Wright moved to Paris in 1946. He became a permanent American expatriate.\nIn Paris, Wright became friends with French writers Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus, whom he had met while still in New York, and he and his wife became particularly good friends with Simone de Beauvoir, who stayed with them in 1947. However, as Michel Fabre argues, Wright's existentialist leanings were more influenced by S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, Edmund Husserl, and especially Martin Heidegger. In following Fabre's argument, with respect to Wright's existentialist proclivities during the period of 1946 to 1951, Hue Woodson suggests that Wright's exposure to Husserl and Heidegger \"directly came as an intended consequence of the inadequacies of Sartre's synthesis of existentialism and Marxism for Wright\". His Existentialist phase was expressed in his second novel, \"The Outsider\" (1953), which described an African-American character's involvement with the Communist Party in New York. He also became friends with fellow expatriate writers Chester Himes and James Baldwin. His relationship with the latter ended in acrimony after Baldwin published his essay \"Everybody's Protest Novel\" (collected in \"Notes of a Native Son\"), in which he criticized Wright's portrayal of Bigger Thomas as stereotypical. In 1954 Wright published \"Savage Holiday\".\nAfter becoming a French citizen in 1947, Wright continued to travel through Europe, Asia, and Africa. He drew material from these trips for numerous nonfiction works. In 1949, Wright contributed to the anti-communist anthology \"The God That Failed;\" his essay had been published in the \"Atlantic Monthly\" three years earlier and was derived from the unpublished portion of \"Black Boy.\" He was invited to join the Congress for Cultural Freedom, which he rejected, correctly suspecting that it had connections with the CIA. Fearful of links between African Americans and communists, the FBI had Wright under surveillance starting in 1943. With the heightened communist fears of the 1950s, Wright was blacklisted by Hollywood movie studio executives. But in 1950, he starred as Bigger Thomas in an Argentinian film version of \"Native Son.\"\nIn mid-1953, Wright traveled to the Gold Coast, where Kwame Nkrumah was leading the country to independence from British rule, to be established as Ghana. Before Wright returned to Paris, he gave a confidential report to the United States consulate in Accra on what he had learned about Nkrumah and his political party. After Wright returned to Paris, he met twice with an officer from the U.S. State Department. The officer's report includes what Wright had learned from Nkrumah's adviser George Padmore about Nkrumah's plans for the Gold Coast after independence. Padmore, a Trinidadian living in London, believed Wright to be a good friend. His many letters in the Wright papers at Yale's Beinecke Library attest to this, and the two men continued their correspondence. Wright's book on his African journey, \"Black Power\", was published in 1954; its London publisher was Dennis Dobson, who also published Padmore's work.\nWhatever political motivations Wright had for reporting to American officials, he was also an American who wanted to stay abroad and needed their approval to have his passport renewed. According to Wright biographer Addison Gayle, a few months later Wright talked to officials at the American embassy in Paris about people he had met in the Communist Party; at the time these individuals were being prosecuted in the US under the Smith Act.\nHistorian Carol Polsgrove explored why Wright appeared to have little to say about the increasing activism of the civil rights movement during the 1950s in the United States. She found that he was under what his friend Chester Himes called \"extraordinary pressure\" to avoid writing about the US. As \"Ebony\" magazine delayed publishing his essay \"I Choose Exile\", Wright finally suggested publishing it in a white periodical. He believed that \"a white periodical would be less vulnerable to accusations of disloyalty\". He thought the \"Atlantic Monthly\" was interested, but in the end, the piece went unpublished.\nIn 1955, Wright visited Indonesia for the Bandung Conference. He recorded his observations on the conference as well as on Indonesian cultural conditions in \"The Color Curtain: A Report on the Bandung Conference\". Wright praised the conference extensively. He gave at least two lectures to Indonesian cultural groups, including PEN Club Indonesia, and he interviewed Indonesian artists and intellectuals in preparation to write \"The Color Curtain\". Several Indonesian artists and intellectuals whom Wright met, later commented on how he had depicted Indonesian cultural conditions in his travel writing.\nOther works by Wright included \"White Man, Listen!\" (1957) and a novel \"The Long Dream\" (1958), which was adapted as a play and produced in New York in 1960 by Ketti Frings. It explores the relationship between a man named Fish and his father. A collection of short stories, \"Eight Men\", was published posthumously in 1961, shortly after Wright's death. These works dealt primarily with the poverty, anger, and protests of northern and southern urban black Americans.\nHis agent, Paul Reynolds, sent strongly negative criticism of Wright's 400-page \"Island of Hallucinations\" manuscript in February 1959. Despite that, in March Wright outlined a novel in which his character Fish was to be liberated from racial conditioning and become dominating. By May 1959, Wright wanted to leave Paris and live in London. He felt French politics had become increasingly submissive to United States pressure. The peaceful Parisian atmosphere he had enjoyed had been shattered by quarrels and attacks instigated by enemies of the expatriate black writers.\nOn June 26, 1959, after a party marking the French publication of \"White Man, Listen!\", Wright became ill. He suffered a virulent attack of amoebic dysentery, probably contracted during his 1953 stay on the Gold Coast. By November 1959, his wife had found a London apartment, but Wright's illness and \"four hassles in twelve days\" with British immigration officials ended his desire to live in England.\nOn February 19, 1960, Wright learned from his agent Reynolds that the New York premiere of the stage adaptation of \"The Long Dream\" had received such bad reviews that the adapter, Ketti Frings, had decided to cancel further performances. Meanwhile, Wright was running into added problems trying to get \"The Long Dream\" published in France. These setbacks prevented his finishing revisions of \"Island of Hallucinations\", for which he was trying to get a publication commitment from Doubleday and Company.\nIn June 1960, Wright recorded a series of discussions for French radio, dealing primarily with his books and literary career. He also addressed the racial situation in the United States and the world, and specifically denounced American policy in Africa. In late September, to cover extra expenses for his daughter Julia's move from London to Paris to attend the Sorbonne, Wright wrote blurbs for record jackets for Nicole Barclay, director of the largest record company in Paris.\nIn spite of his financial straits, Wright refused to compromise his principles. He declined to participate in a series of programs for Canadian radio because he suspected American control. For the same reason, he rejected an invitation from the Congress for Cultural Freedom to go to India to speak at a conference in memory of Leo Tolstoy. Still interested in literature, Wright helped Kyle Onstott get his novel \"Mandingo\" (1957) published in France.\nWright's last display of explosive energy occurred on November 8, 1960, in his polemical lecture \"The Situation of the Black Artist and Intellectual in the United States\", delivered to students and members of the American Church in Paris. He argued that American society reduced the most militant members of the black community to slaves whenever they wanted to question the racial status quo. He offered as proof the subversive attacks of the Communists against \"Native Son\" and the quarrels that James Baldwin and other authors sought with him. On November 26, 1960, Wright talked enthusiastically with Langston Hughes about his work \"Daddy Goodness\" and gave him the manuscript.\nOn November 28, 1960, Wright went to the Eug\u00e8ne Gibez clinic in Paris for a periodic check-up of his amoebic dysentery condition. He died in the clinic that night of sudden heart failure. He was 52. He was interred in P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery. Wright's daughter Julia, and his close friend and fellow expatriate Ollie Harrington, were both suspicious of the circumstances of Wright's death and alleged that the author may have been murdered by the U.S. government.\nA number of Wright's works have been published posthumously. In addition, some of Wright's more shocking passages dealing with race, sex, and politics were cut or omitted before original publication of works during his lifetime. In 1991, unexpurgated versions of \"Native Son\", \"Black Boy\", and his other works were published. In addition, in 1994, his novella \"Rite of Passage\" was published for the first time.\nIn the last years of his life, Wright had become enamored of the Japanese poetic form haiku and wrote more than 4,000 such short poems. In 1998 a book was published (\"Haiku: This Other World\") with 817 of his own favorite haiku. Many of these haiku have an uplifting quality even as they deal with coming to terms with loneliness, death, and the forces of nature.\nA collection of Wright's travel writings was published by the University Press of Mississippi in 2001. At his death, Wright left an unfinished book, \"A Father's Law\", dealing with a black policeman and the son he suspects of murder. His daughter Julia Wright published \"A Father's Law\" in January 2008. An omnibus edition containing Wright's political works was published under the title \"Three Books from Exile: Black Power; The Color Curtain\"; and \"White Man, Listen!\"\nPersonal life.\nIn August 1939, with Ralph Ellison as best man, Wright married Dhimah Rose Meidman, a modern dance teacher of Russian Jewish ancestry. The marriage ended a year later.\nOn March 12, 1941, Wright married Ellen Poplar (n\u00e9e Poplowitz), a Communist organizer from Brooklyn. They had two daughters: Julia, born in 1942, and Rachel, born in 1949.\nEllen Wright, who died on April 6, 2004, aged 92, was the executor of Wright's estate. In this capacity, she unsuccessfully sued a biographer, the poet and writer Margaret Walker, in \"Wright v. Warner Books, Inc.\" She was a literary agent, and her clients included Simone de Beauvoir, Eldridge Cleaver, and Violette Leduc.\nLegacy.\n\"Black Boy\" became an instant best-seller upon its publication in 1945. Wright's stories published during the 1950s disappointed some critics who said that his move to Europe had alienated him from African Americans and separated him from his emotional and psychological roots. Many of Wright's works failed to satisfy the rigid standards of New Criticism during a period when the works of younger black writers gained in popularity.\nDuring the 1950s Wright grew more internationalist in outlook. While he accomplished much as an important public literary and political figure with a worldwide reputation, his creative work did decline.\nWhile interest in \"Black Boy\" ebbed during the 1950s, this has remained one of his best selling books. Since the late 20th century, critics have had a resurgence of interest in it. \"Black Boy\" remains a vital work of historical, sociological, and literary significance whose seminal portrayal of one black man's search for self-actualization in a racist society strongly influenced the works of African-American writers who followed, such as James Baldwin and Ralph Ellison. John A. Williams included a fictionalized version of Wright's life and death in his 1967 novel \"The Man Who Cried I Am\".\nIt is generally agreed that the influence of Wright's \"Native Son\" is not a matter of literary style or technique. Rather, this book affected ideas and attitudes, and \"Native Son\" has been a force in the social and intellectual history of the United States in the last half of the 20th century. \"Wright was one of the people who made me conscious of the need to struggle,\" said writer Amiri Baraka. \nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, scholars published critical essays about Wright in prestigious journals. Richard Wright conferences were held on university campuses from Mississippi to New Jersey. A new film version of \"Native Son\", with a screenplay by Richard Wesley, was released in December 1986. Certain Wright novels became required reading in a number of American high schools, universities and colleges.\nRecent critics have called for a reassessment of Wright's later work in view of his philosophical project. Notably, Paul Gilroy has argued that \"the depth of his philosophical interests has been either overlooked or misconceived by the almost exclusively literary inquiries that have dominated analysis of his writing\".\nWright was featured in a 90-minute documentary about the WPA Writers' Project entitled \"Soul of a People: Writing America's Story\" (2009). His life and work during the 1930s is highlighted in the companion book, \"Soul of a People: The WPA Writers' Project Uncovers Depression America\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 1982, she became the first African-American woman to win the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, which she was awarded for her novel \"The Color Purple\". Over the span of her career, Walker has published seventeen novels and short story collections, twelve non-fiction works, and collections of essays and poetry.\nWalker, born in rural Georgia, overcame challenges such as childhood injury and segregation to become high school valedictorian and graduate from Sarah Lawrence College. She began her writing career with her first book of poetry, \"Once\", and later wrote novels, including her best-known work, \"The Color Purple\". As an activist, Walker participated in the Civil Rights Movement, advocated for women of color through the term \"womanism,\" and has been involved in animal advocacy and pacifism. Additionally, she has taken a strong stance on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, supporting the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign against Israel.\nWalker has faced multiple accusations of antisemitism due to her praise for British conspiracy theorist David Icke and his works, which contain antisemitic conspiracy theories, along with criticisms of her own writings.\nEarly life and education.\nAlice Malsenior Walker was born in Eatonton, Georgia, a rural farming town, to Willie Lee Walker and Minnie Tallulah Grant. Both of Walker's parents were sharecroppers, though her mother also worked as a seamstress to earn extra money. Walker, the youngest of eight children, was first enrolled in school when she was just four years old at East Putnam Consolidated.\nAs an eight-year-old, Walker sustained an injury to her right eye after one of her brothers fired a BB gun. Since her family did not have access to a car, Walker could not receive immediate medical attention, causing her to become permanently blind in that eye. It was after the injury to her eye that Walker began to take up reading and writing. The scar tissue was removed when Walker was 14, but a mark still remains. It is described in her essay \"Beauty: When the Other Dancer is the Self\".\nAs the schools in Eatonton were segregated, Walker attended the only high school available to Black students: Butler Baker High School. There, she went on to become valedictorian, and enrolled in Spelman College in 1961 after being granted a full scholarship by the state of Georgia for having the highest academic achievements of her class. She found two of her professors, Howard Zinn and Staughton Lynd, to be great mentors during her time at Spelman, but both were transferred two years later. Walker was offered another scholarship, this time from Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers, New York, and after the firing of her Spelman professor, Howard Zinn, Walker accepted the offer. Walker became pregnant at the start of her senior year and had an abortion; this experience, as well as the bout of suicidal thoughts that followed, inspired much of the poetry found in \"Once\", Walker's first collection of poetry. Walker graduated from Sarah Lawrence College in 1965.\nWriting career.\nWalker wrote the poems that would culminate in her first book of poetry, entitled \"Once\", while she was a student in East Africa and during her senior year at Sarah Lawrence College. Walker would slip her poetry under the office door of her professor and mentor, Muriel Rukeyser, when she was a student at Sarah Lawrence. Rukeyser then showed the poems to her literary agent. \"Once\" was published four years later by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich.\nFollowing graduation, Walker briefly worked for the New York City Department of Welfare, before returning to the South. She took a job working for the Legal Defense Fund of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Jackson, Mississippi. Walker also worked as a consultant in Black history to the Friends of the Children of Mississippi Head Start program. She later returned to writing as writer-in-residence at Jackson State University (1968\u201369) and Tougaloo College (1970\u201371). In addition to her work at Tougaloo College, Walker published her first novel, \"The Third Life of Grange Copeland,\" in 1970. The novel explores the life of Grange Copeland, an abusive, irresponsible sharecropper, husband and father.\nIn 1973, before becoming editor of \"Ms.\" magazine, Walker and literary scholar Charlotte D. Hunt discovered an unmarked grave they believed to be that of Zora Neale Hurston in Ft. Pierce, Florida. Walker had it marked with a gray marker stating ZORA NEALE HURSTON / \"A GENIUS OF THE SOUTH\" / NOVELIST FOLKLORIST / ANTHROPOLOGIST / 1901\u20131960. The line \"a genius of the south\" is from Jean Toomer's poem \"Georgia Dusk\", which appears in his book \"Cane\". Hurston was actually born in 1891, not 1901.\nWalker's 1975 article \"https://\", published in \"Ms.\" magazine and later retitled \"Looking for Zora\", helped revive interest in the work of this Afro-American writer and anthropologist.\nIn 1976, Walker's second novel, \"Meridian,\" was published. \"Meridian\" is a novel about activist workers in the South, during the civil rights movement, with events that closely parallel some of Walker's own experiences. In 1982, she published what has become her best-known work, \"The Color Purple\". The novel follows a young, troubled Black woman who is not just fighting her way through a racist white culture, she is also fighting her way through a patriarchal Black culture. The book became a bestseller, and it was subsequently adapted into a critically acclaimed 1985 movie which was directed by Steven Spielberg, starring Oprah Winfrey and Whoopi Goldberg, as well as a 2005 Broadway musical totaling 910 performances.\nWalker has written several other novels, including \"The Temple of My Familiar\" (1989) and \"Possessing the Secret of Joy\" (1992) (which featured several characters and descendants of characters from \"The Color Purple\"). She has published a number of collections of short stories, poetry, and other writings. Her work is focused on the struggles of Black people, particularly women, and their lives in a racist, sexist, and violent society.\nIn 1993, Alice Walker coauthored a novel, \"Warrior Marks,\" alongside feminist activist, Pratibha Parmar. The novel was based on the topic of \"Female Genital Mutilation\" (FGM) and the Sexual Blinding of Women. The novel takes place in Africa, where the two of them collectively interview several survivors of FGM. The novel seeks to unearth the sociocultural rationale behind the practice by providing a platform to activists who stand in opposition to this issue.\nIn 2000, Walker released a collection of short fiction, based on her own life, called \"The Way Forward Is With a Broken Heart,\" exploring love and race relations. In this book, Walker details her interracial relationship with Melvyn Rosenman Leventhal, a civil rights attorney who was also working in Mississippi. The couple married on March 17, 1967, in New York City, since interracial marriage was then illegal in the South, and divorced in 1976. They had a daughter, Rebecca, together in 1969. Rebecca Walker, Alice Walker's only child, is an American novelist, editor, artist, and activist. The Third Wave Foundation, an activist fund, was co-founded by Rebecca and Shannon Liss-Riordan. Her godmother is Alice Walker's mentor and co-founder of \"Ms.\" magazine, Gloria Steinem.\nIn 2007, Walker donated her papers, consisting of 122 boxes of manuscripts and archive material, to Emory University's Manuscript, Archives, and Rare Book Library. In addition to drafts of novels such as \"The Color Purple\", unpublished poems and manuscripts, and correspondence with editors, the collection includes extensive correspondence with family members, friends and colleagues, early treatment of the film script for \"The Color Purple\", syllabi from courses she taught, and fan mail. The collection also contains a scrapbook of poetry compiled when Walker was 15, entitled \"Poems of a Childhood Poetess\".\nIn 2013, Alice Walker published two new books, one of them entitled \"The Cushion in the Road: Meditation and Wandering as the Whole World Awakens to Being in Harm's Way\". The other was a book of poems entitled \"The World Will Follow Joy: Turning Madness into Flowers (New Poems)\".\nActivism.\nCivil rights.\nWalker met Martin Luther King Jr. when she was a student at Spelman College in the early 1960s. She credits King for her decision to return to the American South as an activist in the Civil Rights Movement. She took part in the 1963 March on Washington with hundreds of thousands of people. Later, she volunteered to register Black voters in Georgia and Mississippi.\nOn March 8, 2003, International Women's Day, on the eve of the Iraq War, Walker was arrested with 26 others, including fellow authors Maxine Hong Kingston and Terry Tempest Williams, at a protest outside the White House, for crossing a police line during an anti-war rally. Walker wrote about the experience in her essay \"We Are the Ones We Have Been Waiting For\".\nWomanism.\nWalker's specific brand of feminism included advocacy on behalf of women of color. In 1983, Walker coined the term \"womanist\" in her collection \"In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens\", to mean \"a Black feminist or feminist of color\". The term was made to unite women of color and the feminist movement at \"the intersection of race, class, and gender oppression\". Walker states that \"'Womanism' gives us a word of our own\". because it is a discourse of Black women and the issues they confront in society. Womanism as a movement came into fruition in 1985 at the American Academy of Religion and the Society of Biblical Literature to address Black women's concerns from their own intellectual, physical, and spiritual perspectives.\" Today, her womanist ideology still persists within several movements including the Black Lives Matter Movement that was formed by Black women in response to overwhelming police brutality against Black males. The philosophy of womanism also served as the fundamental basis for the #MeToo Movement in which women publicly expressed their experiences of sexual abuse and harassment.\nFeminist advocacy.\nWalker's idea of feminist advocacy emerged in her work, \"In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens\", specifically in the essay, \"\". In her piece, she reflects on the modern injustices and historical oppression of the feminist movement. She also touches upon the need for compassion, empathy and awareness on behalf of Black women to overcome the past atrocities such as slavery and colonialism. In the end, the essay provides both a critique on the Black feminist movement and a call to action for readers to liberate themselves from discrimination.\nIsraeli\u2013Palestinian conflict.\nWalker is a judge member of the , and she also supports the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign against Israel.\nIn January 2009, Walker was one of over fifty signatories of a letter protesting against the Toronto International Film Festival's \"City to City\" spotlight on Israeli filmmakers, and condemning Israel as an \"apartheid regime\". Two months later, Walker and sixty other female activists from the anti-war group Code Pink traveled to Gaza in response to the Gaza War. Their purpose was to deliver aid, meet with NGOs and residents, and persuade Israel and Egypt to open their borders with Gaza. She planned to visit Gaza again in December 2009 to participate in the Gaza Freedom March. On June 23, 2011, she announced plans to participate in an aid flotilla to Gaza that attempted to break Israel's naval blockade.\nIn May 2013, Walker posted an open letter to singer Alicia Keys, asking her to cancel a planned concert in Tel Aviv. \"I believe we are mutually respectful of each other's path and work,\" Walker wrote. \"It would grieve me to know you are putting yourself in danger (soul danger) by performing in an apartheid country that is being boycotted by many global conscious artists.\" Keys rejected the plea. Walker has refused to allow \"The Color Purple\" to be translated and published in Hebrew, saying that she finds that \"Israel is guilty of apartheid and persecution of the Palestinian people, both inside Israel and also in the Occupied Territories\" and noting that she had refused to allow Steven Spielberg's film adaptation of her novel to be shown in South Africa until the system of apartheid was dismantled.\nSupport for Chelsea Manning and Julian Assange.\nIn June 2013, Walker and others appeared in a video expressing their support for Chelsea Manning, an American soldier who was imprisoned for releasing classified information. In recent years, Walker has spoken out repeatedly in support of Julian Assange. Founder of Wikileaks, Assange was considered a large threat to U.S. national security during the Obama administration, as he revealed classified intelligence information surrounding war crimes and human rights violations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Guantanamo Bay. Subsequently, Assange was arrested after attempting to seek refuge in the Ecuador embassy in London. He was later extradited to the U.S. and prosecuted on criminal charges. In light of these developments, Alice Walker published an Opinion Editorial taking aim at the US justice system and calling for the vindication of the charges brought against Assange. Moreover, Walker also took part in a panel discussion in Berkeley, California for the purpose of freeing Assange.\nAnimal advocacy.\nWalker has expressed that animal advocacy is one of her central concerns. Her fiction has increasingly embraced animal ethics over the past four decades, as she works to include animals as both active participants in her novels and as symbols for what she has called \"consciousness.\" Her earliest fiction represents nonhuman animals inasmuch as they are part of human life \u2013 namely as farmed animals, food sources, and absent referents for animalized epithets directed at humans, and her fiction increasingly incorporates the animal experience. She has advocated for greater consciousness in human beings and their relationships with animals, stating: \"Encouraging others to love nature, to respect other human beings and animals, to adore this earth, is part of my work in this world.\"\nPacifism.\nWalker has been a longtime sponsor of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. In early 2015, she wrote: \"So I think of any movement for peace and justice as something that is about stabilizing our inner spirit so that we can go on and bring into the world a vision that is much more humane than the one we have dominant today.\" She has written several works that convey her pacifist views, those including \"The Same River Twice\" and \"We are the Ones We have been Waiting for: Inner Light in a Time of Darkness.\" She discusses the importance for establishing an equitable and peaceful society.\nTransgender rights.\nIn 2023, Walker publicly defended J. K. Rowling from criticisms of her views regarding trans people. Walker wrote on her website: \"I consider J.K. Rowling perfectly within her rights as a human being of obvious caring for humanity to express her views about whatever is of concern to her. As she has done.\" She herself expressed the view that women were being \"erased\" in language, dictionaries and society, and that \"confusion\" with respect to gender had led to hasty sex reassignment surgeries, at least when minors were concerned. Walker was criticized on social media for taking this position with many referring to her as a TERF. In a subsequent essay, Walker addressed trans people, stating: \"I fully understand that your life belongs to you; therefore whatever changes you make, I offer my prayers for a beautiful transformation and complete recovery\", and acknowledged that one of the \"most loving and balanced people\" she knew was a trans man.\nAccusations of antisemitism and praise for David Icke.\nSince 2012, Walker has expressed appreciation for the works of the British conspiracy theorist David Icke. On BBC Radio 4's \"Desert Island Discs\", she said that Icke's book \"Human Race Get Off Your Knees: The Lion Sleeps No More\", which contains antisemitic conspiracy theories, would be the book she would take to a desert island. The book promotes the theory that the Earth is ruled by shapeshifting reptilian humanoids and \"Rothschild Zionists\". Jonathan Kay of the \"National Post\" described this book (and Icke's other books) as \"hateful, hallucinogenic nonsense\". Kay wrote that Walker's public praise for Icke's book was \"stunningly offensive\" and that by taking it seriously, she was disqualifying herself \"from the mainstream marketplace of ideas\". In 2013, the Anti-Defamation League called anti-Zionist essays in Walker's book \"The Cushion in the Road\" \"replete with fervently anti-Jewish ideas\" and it also stated that Walker was \"unabashedly infected with anti-Semitism\".\nOn her blog in 2017, Walker published a poem which she titled \"It Is Our (Frightful) Duty to Study The Talmud\", recommending that the reader should start with YouTube to learn about the allegedly shocking aspects of the Talmud, describing it as \"poison\". The poem contained antisemitic tropes and arguments. In it, she also \"describes her reaction when a Jewish friend\", later stated to be her ex-husband, accused her \"of appearing to be antisemitic\".\nIn 2018, an interviewer from \"The New York Times Book Review\" asked Walker \"What books are on your nightstand?\" She listed Icke's \"And the Truth Shall Set You Free,\" a book promoting an antisemitic conspiracy theory which draws on \"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\" and questions the Holocaust. Walker said: \"In Icke's books there is the whole of existence, on this planet and several others, to think about. A curious person's dream come true.\" The publication of the interview in the \"By the Book\" weekly column generated significant criticism of Walker and the \"New York Times Book Review\". The \"Review\" was criticized for publishing the interview as well as for failing to contextualize \"And the Truth Shall Set You Free\" as an antisemitic work. Walker defended her admiration for Icke and his book, saying: \"I do not believe he is anti-Semitic or anti-Jewish\". Walker argued that any \"attempt to smear David Icke, and by association, me, is really an effort to dampen the effect of our speaking out in support of the people of Palestine\". Following the controversy Roxane Gay argued that \"Alice Walker has been anti-Semitic for years\". The NYT released a statement that the contents of the interview \"do not imply an endorsement by Times editors\".\nIn 2019, Ayanna Pressley disavowed antisemitism after an uproar ensued following her tweeting of an Alice Walker quote. She tweeted \"I fully condemn and denounce anti-Semitism, prejudice and bigotry in all their forms \u2013 and the hateful actions they embolden\" and said she had been unaware of Walker's statements on the issue.\nIn 2020, after learning about Walker's perceived support of anti-Semitism, the host of the \"New York Times\" podcast \"Sugar Calling\" described herself as \"mortified\" for having hosted Walker on her show and she also said: \"If I'd known, I wouldn't have asked Alice Walker to be on the show.\"\nIn April 2022, Gayle King of CBS News was criticized for interviewing Walker without challenging her anti-Semitic writings. After the interview, King released a statement, saying: \"These are not only legitimate questions, they are mandatory questions. I certainly would have asked her about the criticisms, if I had been aware of them before the interview with Ms.\u00a0Walker.\"\nIn 2022, Walker was disinvited from the Bay Area Book Festival due to what the organizers referred to as her \"endorsement of anti-Semitic conspiracy theorist David Icke\". An invitation for Walker to speak at San Diego Community College District was upheld despite opposition from community groups with the organizers citing their belief in free speech. Walker dismissed the criticism as \"a ploy to shut down my webpage blog: alicewalkersgarden.com.\"\nPersonal life.\nIn 1965, Walker met Melvyn Rosenman Leventhal, a Jewish civil rights lawyer. They were married on March 17, 1967, in New York City. Later that year, the couple relocated to Jackson, Mississippi, becoming the first legally married interracial couple in Mississippi since miscegenation laws were introduced in the state. The couple had a daughter, Rebecca, in 1969. Walker and her husband divorced in 1976.\nIn the late 1970s, Walker moved to northern California. In 1984, she and fellow writer Robert L. Allen co-founded Wild Tree Press, a feminist publishing company in Anderson Valley, California. Walker legally added \"Tallulah Kate\" to her name in 1994 to honor her mother, Minnie Tallulah Grant, and paternal grandmother, Tallulah. Minnie Tallulah Grant's grandmother, Tallulah, was Cherokee.\nWalker has claimed that she was in a romantic relationship with singer-songwriter Tracy Chapman in the mid-1990s: \"It was delicious and lovely and wonderful and I totally enjoyed it and I was completely in love with her but it was not anybody's business but ours.\" Chapman has not publicly commented on the existence of a relationship between herself and Walker and maintains a strict separation between her private and public life.\nWalker's spirituality has influenced some of her best-known novels, including \"The Color Purple.\" She has written of her interest in Transcendental Meditation. Walker's exploration of religion in much of her writing draws on a literary tradition that includes writers like Zora Neale Hurston.\nWalker has never denied that there are some autobiographical dimensions to her stories. When \"Advancing Luna\u2014and Ida B. Wells\" was first published in \"Ms.\" magazine, Walker included a disclaimer that \"Luna and Freddie Pye are composite characters, and their names are made up. This is a fictionalized account suggested by a number of real events\". John O' Brien's 1973 interview with Walker offers further details.\nTeaching and Feminist Rights Movement.\nAside from her civil rights activism, Walker would often educate others about the Black feminist movement through her teachings at several different higher education institutions. In the fall of 1972, Walker taught a course in Black Women's Writers at the University of Massachusetts Boston. as well as Wellesley College in 1973. Moreover, that same year, she also published her primary collection of short stories \"In Love and Trouble: Stories of Black Women,\" as well as \"Revolutionary Petunias and Other Poems\" which served as a second volume of her poetry. In addition, she also taught an American Women studies class at Brandeis University in Waltham. Aside from the schools in Massachusetts at which she taught at, she gave several lectures on the topics of African-American Women Studies at Yale University as well as University of California, Berkeley. Overall, Walker gave several lectures at a variety of different institutions throughout America which allowed her to spread the ideas of the Black feminist movement.\nRepresentation in other media.\n\"Beauty in Truth\" (2013) is a documentary film about Walker directed by Pratibha Parmar. \"Phalia (Portrait of Alice Walker)\" (1989) is a photograph by Maud Sulter from her \"Zabat\" series originally produced for the Rochdale Art Gallery in England.\nSelected works.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1993. Her first novel, \"The Bluest Eye\", was published in 1970. The critically acclaimed \"Song of Solomon\" (1977) brought her national attention and won the National Book Critics Circle Award. In 1988, Morrison won the Pulitzer Prize for \"Beloved\" (1987).\nBorn and raised in Lorain, Ohio, Morrison graduated from Howard University in 1953 with a B.A. in English. Morrison earned a master's degree in American Literature from Cornell University in 1955. In 1957 she returned to Howard University, was married, and had two children before divorcing in 1964. Morrison became the first Black female editor for fiction at Random House in New York City in the late 1960s. She developed her own reputation as an author in the 1970s and '80s. Her novel \"Beloved\" was made into a film in 1998. Morrison's works are praised for addressing the harsh consequences of racism in the United States and the Black American experience.\nThe National Endowment for the Humanities selected Morrison for the Jefferson Lecture, the U.S. federal government's highest honor for achievement in the humanities, in 1996. She was honored with the National Book Foundation's Medal of Distinguished Contribution to American Letters the same year. President Barack Obama presented her with the Presidential Medal of Freedom on May 29, 2012. She received the PEN/Saul Bellow Award for Achievement in American Fiction in 2016. Morrison was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame in 2020.\nEarly years.\nToni Morrison was born Chloe Ardelia Wofford, the second of four children from a working-class, Black family, in Lorain, Ohio, to Ramah (n\u00e9e Willis) and George Wofford. Her mother was born in Greenville, Alabama, and moved north with her family as a child. She was a homemaker and a devout member of the African Methodist Episcopal Church. George Wofford grew up in Cartersville, Georgia. When Wofford was about 15 years old, a group of white people lynched two African-American businessmen who lived on his street. Morrison later said: \"He never told us that he'd seen bodies. But he had seen them. And that was too traumatic, I think, for him.\" Soon after the lynching, George Wofford moved to the racially integrated town of Lorain, Ohio, in the hope of escaping racism and securing gainful employment in Ohio's burgeoning industrial economy. He worked odd jobs and as a welder for U.S. Steel. In a 2015 interview Morrison said that her father, traumatized by his experiences of racism, hated whites so much he would not let them in the house.\nWhen Morrison was about two years old, her family's landlord set fire to the house in which they lived, while they were home, because her parents could not afford to pay rent. Her family responded to what she called this \"bizarre form of evil\" by laughing at the landlord rather than falling into despair. Morrison later said her family's response demonstrated how to keep your integrity and claim your own life in the face of acts of such \"monumental crudeness\".\nMorrison's parents instilled in her a sense of heritage and language through telling traditional African-American folktales, ghost stories, and singing songs. She read frequently as a child; among her favorite authors were Jane Austen and Leo Tolstoy.\nMorrison became a Catholic at the age of 12 and took the baptismal name Anthony (after Anthony of Padua), which led to her nickname, Toni. Attending Lorain High School, she was on the debate team, the yearbook staff, and in the drama club.\nCareer.\nAdulthood, Howard and Cornell years, and editing career: 1949\u20131975.\nIn 1949, she enrolled at Howard University in Washington, D.C., seeking the company of fellow Black intellectuals. Initially a student in the drama program at Howard, she studied theatre with celebrated drama teachers Anne Cooke Reid and Owen Dodson. It was while at Howard that she encountered racially segregated restaurants and buses for the first time. She graduated in 1953 with a B.A. in English and a minor in Classics, and was able to work with key members of the Harlem Renaissance era such as Alain Locke and Sterling Brown. Additionally, she participated in the university's theater group, known as the Howard Players, where she had the opportunity to travel the Deep South, which was a defining experience of her life.\nMorrison went on to earn a Master of Arts degree in 1955 from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Her master's thesis was titled \"Virginia Woolf's and William Faulkner's treatment of the alienated\". She taught English, first at Texas Southern University in Houston from 1955 to 1957, and then at Howard University for the next seven years. While teaching at Howard, she met Harold Morrison, a Jamaican architect, whom she married in 1958. Their first son was born in 1961 and she was pregnant with their second son when she and Harold divorced in 1964.\nAfter her divorce and the birth of her son Slade in 1965, Morrison began working as an editor for L. W. Singer, a textbook division of publisher Random House, in Syracuse, New York. Two years later, she transferred to Random House in New York City, where she became their first Black woman senior editor in the fiction department.\nIn that capacity, Morrison played a vital role in bringing Black literature into the mainstream. One of the first books she worked on was the groundbreaking \"Contemporary African Literature\" (1972), a collection that included work by Nigerian writers Wole Soyinka, Chinua Achebe, and South African playwright Athol Fugard. She fostered a new generation of Afro-American writers, including poet and novelist Toni Cade Bambara, radical activist Angela Davis, Black Panther Huey Newton and novelist Gayl Jones, whose writing Morrison discovered. She also brought to publication the 1975 autobiography of the outspoken boxing champion Muhammad Ali, \"\". In addition, she published and promoted the work of Henry Dumas, a little-known novelist and poet who in 1968 had been shot to death by a transit officer in the New York City Subway.\nAmong other books that Morrison developed and edited is \"The Black Book\" (1974), an anthology of photographs, illustrations, essays, and documents of Black life in the United States from the time of slavery to the 1920s. Random House had been uncertain about the project but its publication met with a good reception. Alvin Beam reviewed the anthology for the Cleveland \"Plain Dealer\", writing: \"Editors, like novelists, have brain children\u00a0\u2013 books they think up and bring to life without putting their own names on the title page. Mrs. Morrison has one of these in the stores now, and magazines and newsletters in the publishing trade are ecstatic, saying it will go like hotcakes.\"\nThe 2025 biography \"Toni at Random\" was written by Dana A. Williams about Morrison's time employed as an editor at the publishing company Random House. A review by Martha Southgate in \"The New York Times\" stated: \"With great respect and meticulous research, Williams reveals Morrison as a hard worker, a devoted literary citizen and one of the most important book editors of the 20th century.\" \"The Chicago Review of Books\" described it as \"an edifying look at a beloved creator's work as not only a writer, but a champion of writers\", while a starred review in \"Publishers Weekly\" concluded that the biography is \"a triumphant account of an underexplored aspect of Morrison's influence on American literature.\"\nFirst writings and teaching, 1970\u20131986.\nMorrison had begun writing fiction as part of an informal group of poets and writers at Howard University who met to discuss their work. She attended one meeting with a short story about a Black girl who longed to have blue eyes. Morrison later developed the story as her first novel, \"The Bluest Eye\", getting up every morning at 4\u00a0am to write, while raising two children on her own.\n\"The Bluest Eye\" was published by Holt, Rinehart, and Winston in 1970, when Morrison was aged 39. It was favorably reviewed in \"The New York Times\" by John Leonard, who praised Morrison's writing style as being \"a prose so precise, so faithful to speech and so charged with pain and wonder that the novel becomes poetry ... But \"The Bluest Eye\" is also history, sociology, folklore, nightmare and music.\" The novel did not sell well at first, but the City University of New York put \"The Bluest Eye\" on its reading list for its new Black studies department, as did other colleges, which boosted sales. The book also brought Morrison to the attention of the acclaimed editor Robert Gottlieb at Knopf, an imprint of the publisher Random House. Gottlieb later edited all but one of Morrison's novels.\nIn 1975, Morrison's second novel \"Sula\" (1973), about a friendship between two Black women, was nominated for the National Book Award. Her third novel, \"Song of Solomon\" (1977), follows the life of Macon \"Milkman\" Dead III, from birth to adulthood, as he discovers his heritage. This novel brought her national acclaim, being a main selection of the Book of the Month Club, the first novel by a Black writer to be so chosen since Richard Wright's \"Native Son\" in 1940. \"Song of Solomon\" also won the National Book Critics Circle Award.\nAt its 1979 commencement ceremonies, Barnard College awarded Morrison its highest honor, the Barnard Medal of Distinction.\nMorrison gave her next novel, \"Tar Baby\" (1981), a contemporary setting. In it, a looks-obsessed fashion model, Jadine, falls in love with Son, a penniless drifter who feels at ease with being Black.\nResigning from Random House in 1983, Morrison left publishing to devote more time to writing, while living in a converted boathouse on the Hudson River in Nyack, New York. She taught English at two branches of the State University of New York (SUNY) and at Rutgers University's New Brunswick campus. In 1984, she was appointed to an Albert Schweitzer chair at the University at Albany, SUNY.\nMorrison's first play, \"Dreaming Emmett\", is about the 1955 murder by white men of Black teenager Emmett Till. The play was commissioned by the New York State Writers Institute at the State University of New York at Albany, where she was teaching at the time. It was produced in 1986 by Capital Repertory Theatre and directed by Gilbert Moses. Morrison was also a visiting professor at Bard College from 1986 to 1988.\n\"Beloved\" trilogy and the Nobel Prize: 1987\u20131998.\nIn 1987, Morrison published her most celebrated novel, \"Beloved\". It was inspired by the true story of an enslaved African-American woman, Margaret Garner, whose story Morrison had discovered when compiling \"The Black Book\". Garner had escaped slavery but was pursued by slave hunters. Facing a return to slavery, Garner killed her two-year-old daughter but was captured before she could kill herself. Morrison's novel imagines the dead baby returning as a ghost, Beloved, to haunt her mother and family.\n\"Beloved\" was a critical success and a bestseller for 25 weeks. \"The New York Times\" book reviewer Michiko Kakutani wrote that the scene of the mother killing her baby is \"so brutal and disturbing that it appears to warp time before and after into a single unwavering line of fate\". Canadian writer Margaret Atwood wrote in a review for \"The New York Times\", \"Ms. Morrison's versatility and technical and emotional range appear to know no bounds. If there were any doubts about her stature as a pre-eminent American novelist, of her own or any other generation, \"Beloved\" will put them to rest.\"\nSome critics panned \"Beloved\". African-American conservative social critic Stanley Crouch, for instance, complained in his review in \"The New Republic\" that the novel \"reads largely like a melodrama lashed to the structural conceits of the miniseries\", and that Morrison \"perpetually interrupts her narrative with maudlin ideological commercials\".\nDespite overall high acclaim, \"Beloved\" failed to win the prestigious National Book Award or the National Book Critics Circle Award. Forty-eight Black critics and writers, among them Maya Angelou, protested the omission in a statement that \"The New York Times\" published on January 24, 1988. \"Despite the international stature of Toni Morrison, she has yet to receive the national recognition that her five major works of fiction entirely deserve\", they wrote. Two months later, \"Beloved\" won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. It also won an Anisfield-Wolf Book Award.\n\"Beloved\" is the first of three novels about love and African-American history, sometimes called the \"Beloved\" Trilogy. Morrison said they are intended to be read together, explaining: \"The conceptual connection is the search for the beloved \u2013 the part of the self that is you, and loves you, and is always there for you.\" The second novel in the trilogy, \"Jazz\", came out in 1992. Told in language that imitates the rhythms of jazz music, the novel is about a love triangle during the Harlem Renaissance in New York City. According to Lyn Innes, \"Morrison sought to change not just the content and audience for her fiction; her desire was to create stories which could be lingered over and relished, not 'consumed and gobbled as fast food', and at the same time to ensure that these stories and their characters had a strong historical and cultural base.\"\nIn 1992, Morrison also published her first book of literary criticism, \"\" (1992), an examination of the African-American presence in White American literature. (In 2016, \"Time\" magazine noted that \"Playing in the Dark\" was among Morrison's most-assigned texts on U.S. college campuses, together with several of her novels and her 1993 Nobel Prize lecture.) Lyn Innes wrote in the \"Guardian\" obituary of Morrison, \"Her 1990 series of Massey lectures at Harvard were published as Playing in the Dark: Whiteness and the Literary Imagination (1992), and explore the construction of a 'non-white Africanist presence and personae' in the works of Poe, Hawthorne, Melville, Cather and Hemingway, arguing that 'all of us are bereft when criticism remains too polite or too fearful to notice a disrupting darkness before its eyes'.\"\nBefore the third novel of the \"Beloved\" Trilogy was published, Morrison was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1993. The citation praised her as an author \"who in novels characterized by visionary force and poetic import, gives life to an essential aspect of American reality\". She was the first Black woman of any nationality to win the prize. In her acceptance speech, Morrison said: \"We die. That may be the meaning of life. But we do language. That may be the measure of our lives.\"\nIn her Nobel lecture, Morrison talked about the power of storytelling. To make her point, she told a story. She spoke about a blind, old, Black woman who is approached by a group of young people. They demand of her, \"Is there no context for our lives? No song, no literature, no poem full of vitamins, no history connected to experience that you can pass along to help us start strong? ...\u00a0Think of our lives and tell us your particularized world. Make up a story.\"\nMorrison received an honorary Doctor of Letters degree from Howard University during its Charter Day celebration in 1995. After the ceremony, she delivered the speech \"The First Solution\", excerpts of which were later published as an essay titled \"Racism and Fascism\". The speech discussed the ongoing threat of fascism to democracy, which she said makes inroads through a series of ten steps. Scholar Dana A. Williams writes that Morrison lays out the argument that racism \"is as much a strategy used to invoke fear and to uphold fabricated hierarchies as fascism.\"\nIn 1996, the National Endowment for the Humanities selected Morrison for the Jefferson Lecture, the U.S. federal government's highest honor for \"distinguished intellectual achievement in the humanities\". Morrison's lecture, entitled \"The Future of Time: Literature and Diminished Expectations\", began with the aphorism: \"Time, it seems, has no future.\" She cautioned against the misuse of history to diminish expectations of the future. Morrison was also honored with the 1996 National Book Foundation's Medal of Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, which is awarded to a writer \"who has enriched our literary heritage over a life of service, or a corpus of work\".\nThe third novel of her \"Beloved\" Trilogy, \"Paradise\", about citizens of an all-Black town, came out in 1997. The following year, Morrison was on the cover of \"Time\" magazine, making her only the second female writer of fiction and second Black writer of fiction to appear on what was perhaps the most significant U.S. magazine cover of the era.\n\"Beloved\" onscreen and \"the Oprah effect\".\nAlso in 1998, the movie adaptation of \"Beloved\" was released, directed by Jonathan Demme and co-produced by Oprah Winfrey, who had spent ten years bringing it to the screen. Winfrey also stars as the main character, Sethe, alongside Danny Glover as Sethe's lover, Paul D, and Thandiwe Newton as Beloved.\nThe movie flopped at the box office. A review in \"The Economist\" opined that \"most audiences are not eager to endure nearly three hours of a cerebral film with an original storyline featuring supernatural themes, murder, rape, and slavery\". Film critic Janet Maslin, in her \"New York Times\" review \"No Peace from a Brutal Legacy\", called it a \"transfixing, deeply felt adaptation of Toni Morrison's novel. ...\u00a0Its linchpin is of course Oprah Winfrey, who had the clout and foresight to bring 'Beloved' to the screen and has the dramatic presence to hold it together.\" Film critic Roger Ebert suggested that \"Beloved\" was not a genre ghost story but the supernatural was used to explore deeper issues and the non-linear structure of Morrison's story had a purpose.\nIn 1996, television talk-show host Oprah Winfrey selected \"Song of Solomon\" for her newly launched Book Club, which became a popular feature on her \"Oprah Winfrey Show\". An average of 13 million viewers watched the show's book club segments. As a result, when Winfrey selected Morrison's earliest novel \"The Bluest Eye\" in 2000, it sold another 800,000 paperback copies. John Young wrote in the \"African American Review\" in 2001 that Morrison's career experienced the boost of \"The Oprah Effect, ...\u00a0enabling Morrison to reach a broad, popular audience.\"\nWinfrey selected a total of four of Morrison's novels over six years, giving Morrison's works a bigger sales boost than they received from her Nobel Prize win in 1993. The novelist also appeared three times on Winfrey's show. Winfrey said, \"For all those who asked the question 'Toni Morrison again?'...\u00a0I say with certainty there would have been no Oprah's Book Club if this woman had not chosen to share her love of words with the world.\" Morrison called the book club a \"reading revolution\".\nEarly 21st century.\nMorrison continued to explore different art forms, such as providing texts for original scores of classical music. She collaborated with Andr\u00e9 Previn on the song cycle \"Honey and Rue\", which premiered with Kathleen Battle in January 1992, and on \"Four Songs\", premiered at Carnegie Hall with Sylvia McNair in November 1994. Both \"Sweet Talk: Four Songs on Text\" and \"Spirits In the Well\" (1997) were written for Jessye Norman with music by Richard Danielpour, and, alongside Maya Angelou and Clarissa Pinkola Est\u00e9s, Morrison provided the text for composer Judith Weir's \"woman.life.song\" commissioned by Carnegie Hall for Jessye Norman, which premiered in April 2000.\nMorrison returned to Margaret Garner's life story, the basis of her novel \"Beloved\", to write the libretto for a new opera, \"Margaret Garner\". Completed in 2002, with music by Richard Danielpour, the opera was premi\u00e8red on May 7, 2005, at the Detroit Opera House with Denyce Graves in the title role. \"Love\", Morrison's first novel since \"Paradise\", came out in 2003. In 2004, she put together a children's book called \"Remember\" to mark the 50th anniversary of the \"Brown v. Board of Education\" Supreme Court decision in 1954 that declared racially segregated public schools to be unconstitutional.\nFrom 1997 to 2003, Morrison was an Andrew D. White Professor-at-Large at Cornell University.\nIn 2004, Morrison was invited by Wellesley College to deliver the commencement address, which has been described as \"among the greatest commencement addresses of all time and a courageous counterpoint to the entire genre\".\nIn June 2005, the University of Oxford awarded Morrison an honorary Doctor of Letters degree.\nIn the spring 2006, \"The New York Times Book Review\" named \"Beloved\" the best work of American fiction published in the previous 25 years, as chosen by a selection of prominent writers, literary critics, and editors. In his essay about the choice, \"In Search of the Best\", critic A. O. Scott said: \"Any other outcome would have been startling since Morrison's novel has inserted itself into the American canon more completely than any of its potential rivals. With remarkable speed, 'Beloved' has, less than 20 years after its publication, become a staple of the college literary curriculum, which is to say a classic. This triumph is commensurate with its ambition since it was Morrison's intention in writing it precisely to expand the range of classic American literature, to enter, as a living Black woman, the company of dead White males like Faulkner, Melville, Hawthorne and Twain.\"\nIn November 2006, Morrison visited the Louvre museum in Paris as the second in its \"Grand Invit\u00e9\" program to guest-curate a month-long series of events across the arts on the theme of \"The Foreigner's Home\", about which \"The New York Times\" said: \"In tapping her own African-American culture, Ms. Morrison is eager to credit 'foreigners' with enriching the countries where they settle.\"\nMorrison's novel \"A Mercy\", released in 2008, is set in the Virginia colonies of 1682. Diane Johnson, in her review in \"Vanity Fair\", called \"A Mercy\" \"a poetic, visionary, mesmerizing tale that captures, in the cradle of our present problems and strains, the natal curse put on us back then by the Indian tribes, Africans, Dutch, Portuguese, and English competing to get their footing in the New World against a hostile landscape and the essentially tragic nature of human experience.\"\nPrinceton years.\nFrom 1989 until her retirement in 2006, Morrison held the Robert F. Goheen Chair in the Humanities at Princeton University. She said she did not think much of modern fiction writers who reference their own lives instead of inventing new material, and she used to tell her creative writing students, \"I don't want to hear about your little life, OK?\" Practicing what she preached, she chose not to write about her own life in a memoir or autobiography.\nThough based in the Creative Writing Program at Princeton, Morrison did not regularly offer writing workshops to students after the late 1990s, a fact that earned her some criticism. Rather, she conceived and developed the Princeton Atelier, a program that brings together students with writers and performing artists. Together the students and the artists produce works of art that are presented to the public after a semester of collaboration.\nInspired by her curatorship at the Louvre Museum, Morrison returned to Princeton in the fall 2008 to lead a small seminar, also entitled \"The Foreigner's Home\".\nOn November 17, 2017, Princeton University dedicated Morrison Hall (a building previously called West College) in her honor.\nFinal years: 2010\u20132019.\nIn May 2010, Morrison appeared at PEN World Voices for a conversation with Marlene van Niekerk and Kwame Anthony Appiah about South African literature and specifically van Niekerk's 2004 novel \"Agaat\".\nMorrison wrote books for children with her younger son, Slade Morrison, who was a painter and a musician. Slade died of pancreatic cancer on December 22, 2010, aged 45, when Morrison's novel \"Home\" (2012) was half-completed.\nIn May 2011, Morrison received an Honorary Doctor of Letters degree from Rutgers University\u2013New Brunswick. During the commencement ceremony, she delivered a speech on the \"pursuit of life, liberty, meaningfulness, integrity, and truth\".\nIn 2011, Morrison worked with opera director Peter Sellars and Malian singer-songwriter Rokia Traor\u00e9 on \"Desdemona\", taking a fresh look at William Shakespeare's tragedy \"Othello\". The trio focused on the relationship between Othello's wife Desdemona and her African nursemaid, Barbary, who is only briefly referenced in Shakespeare. The play, a mix of words, music and song, premiered in Vienna in 2011.\nMorrison had stopped working on her latest novel when her son died in 2010, later explaining, \"I stopped writing until I began to think, He would be really put out if he thought that he had caused me to stop. 'Please, Mom, I'm dead, could you keep going\u00a0...?'\"\nShe completed \"Home\" and dedicated it to her son Slade. Published in 2012, it is the story of a Korean War veteran in the segregated United States of the 1950s who tries to save his sister from brutal medical experiments at the hands of a white doctor.\nIn August 2012, Oberlin College became the home base of the Toni Morrison Society, an international literary society founded in 1993, dedicated to scholarly research of Morrison's work.\nMorrison's eleventh novel, \"God Help the Child\", was published in 2015. It follows Bride, an executive in the fashion and beauty industry whose mother tormented her as a child for being dark-skinned, a trauma that has continued to dog Bride.\nMorrison was a member of the editorial advisory board of \"The Nation\", a magazine started in 1865 by Northern abolitionists.\nPersonal life.\nWhile teaching at Howard University from 1957 to 1964, she met Harold Morrison, a Jamaican architect, whom she married in 1958. She took his last name, and became known as Toni Morrison. Their first son, Harold Ford, was born in 1961. She was pregnant when she and Harold divorced in 1964. Her second son, Slade Kevin Morrison, was born in 1965; he died of pancreatic cancer on December 22, 2010, when Morrison was halfway through writing her novel \"Home.\" She stopped work on the novel for a year or two before completing it; it was published in 2012.\nDeath.\nMorrison died at Montefiore Medical Center in The Bronx, New York City, on August 5, 2019, at the age of 88, from complications of pneumonia.\nA memorial tribute was held on November 21, 2019, at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City. Morrison was eulogized by, among others, Oprah Winfrey, Angela Davis, Michael Ondaatje, David Remnick, Fran Lebowitz, Ta-Nehisi Coates, and Edwidge Danticat. The jazz saxophonist David Murray performed a musical tribute.\nPolitics, literary reception, and legacy.\nPolitics.\nMorrison spoke openly about American politics and race relations.\nIn writing about the 1998 impeachment of Bill Clinton, she claimed that since Whitewater, Bill Clinton was being mistreated in the same way Black people often are:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Years ago, in the middle of the Whitewater investigation, one heard the first murmurs: white skin notwithstanding, this is our first black President. Blacker than any actual black person who could ever be elected in our children's lifetime. After all, Clinton displays almost every trope of blackness: single-parent household, born poor, working-class, saxophone-playing, McDonald's-and-junk-food-loving boy from Arkansas.\nThe phrase \"our first Black president\" was adopted as a positive by Bill Clinton supporters. When the Congressional Black Caucus honored the former president at its dinner in Washington, D.C., on September 29, 2001, for instance, Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-TX), the chair, told the audience that Clinton \"took so many initiatives he made us think for a while we had elected the first black president\".\nIn the context of the 2008 Democratic Primary campaign, Morrison stated to \"Time\" magazine: \"People misunderstood that phrase. I was deploring the way in which President Clinton was being treated, vis-\u00e0-vis the sex scandal that was surrounding him. I said he was being treated like a black on the street, already guilty, already a perp. I have no idea what his real instincts are, in terms of race.\" In the Democratic primary contest for the 2008 presidential race, Morrison endorsed Senator Barack Obama over Senator Hillary Clinton, though expressing admiration and respect for the latter. When he won, Morrison said she felt like an American for the first time. She said, \"I felt very powerfully patriotic when I went to the inauguration of Barack Obama. I felt like a kid.\"\nIn April 2015, speaking of the deaths of Michael Brown, Eric Garner and Walter Scott\u00a0\u2013 three unarmed Black men killed by white police officers\u00a0\u2013 Morrison said: \"People keep saying, 'We need to have a conversation about race.' This is the conversation. I want to see a cop shoot a white unarmed teenager in the back. And I want to see a white man convicted for raping a Black woman. Then when you ask me, 'Is it over?', I will say yes.\"\nAfter the 2016 election of Donald Trump as President of the United States, Morrison wrote an essay, \"Mourning for Whiteness\", published in the November 21, 2016, issue of \"The New Yorker\". In it she argues that white Americans are so afraid of losing privileges afforded them by their race that white voters elected Trump, whom she described as being \"endorsed by the Ku Klux Klan\", in order to keep the idea of white supremacy alive.\nRelationship to feminism.\nAlthough her novels typically concentrate on black women, Morrison did not identify her works as feminist. When asked in a 1998 interview, \"Why distance oneself from feminism?\" she replied: \"In order to be as free as I possibly can, in my own imagination, I can't take positions that are closed. Everything I've ever done, in the writing world, has been to expand articulation, rather than to close it, to open doors, sometimes, not even closing the book\u00a0\u2013 leaving the endings open for reinterpretation, revisitation, a little ambiguity.\" She went on to state that she thought it \"off-putting to some readers, who may feel that I'm involved in writing some kind of feminist tract. I don't subscribe to patriarchy, and I don't think it should be substituted with matriarchy. I think it's a question of equitable access, and opening doors to all sorts of things.\"\nIn 2012, she responded to a question about the difference between black and white feminists in the 1970s. \"Womanists is what black feminists used to call themselves\", she explained. \"They were not the same thing. And also the relationship with men. Historically, black women have always sheltered their men because they were out there, and they were the ones that were most likely to be killed.\"\nW. S. Kottiswari writes in \"Postmodern Feminist Writers\" (2008) that Morrison exemplifies characteristics of \"postmodern feminism\" by \"altering Euro-American dichotomies by rewriting a history written by mainstream historians\" and by her usage of shifting narration in \"Beloved\" and \"Paradise\". Kottiswari states: \"Instead of western logocentric abstractions, Morrison prefers the powerful vivid language of women of color\u00a0... She is essentially postmodern since her approach to myth and folklore is re-visionist.\"\nContributions to Black feminism.\nMany of Morrison's works have been cited by scholars as significant contributions to Black feminism, reflecting themes of race, gender, and sexual identity within her narratives.\nBarbara Smith's 1977 essay \"Toward a Black Feminist Criticism\" argues that Morrison's \"Sula\" is a work of Black feminism, as it presents a lesbian perspective that challenges heterosexual relationships and the conventional family unit. Smith states, \"Consciously or not, Morrison's work poses both lesbian and feminist questions about Black women's autonomy and their impact upon each other's lives.\"\nHilton Als's 2003 profile in \"The New Yorker\" notes that \"Before the late sixties, there was no real Black Studies curriculum in the academy\u2014let alone a post-colonial-studies program or a feminist one. As an editor and author, Morrison, backed by the institutional power of Random House, provided the material for those discussions to begin.\"\nMorrison consistently advocated for feminist ideas that challenge the dominance of the white patriarchal system, frequently rejecting the notion of writing from the perspective of the \"white male gaze\". Feminist political activist Angela Davis notes that \"Toni Morrison's project resides precisely in the effort to discredit the notion that this white male gaze must be omnipresent.\"\nIn a 1998 episode of \"Charlie Rose\", Morrison responded to a review of \"Sula\", stating, \"I remember a review of \"Sula\" in which the reviewer said, 'One day, she', meaning me, 'will have to face up 'to the real responsibilities, and get mature, 'and write about the real confrontation 'for black people, which is white people.' As though our lives have no meaning and no depth without the white gaze, and I have spent my entire writing life trying to make sure that the white gaze was not the dominant one in any of my books.\"\nIn a 2015 interview with \"The New York Times Magazine\", Morrison reiterated her intention to write without the white gaze, stating, \"What I'm interested in is writing without the gaze, without the white gaze. In so many earlier books by African-American writers, particularly the men, I felt that they were not writing to me. But what interested me was the African-American experience throughout whichever time I spoke of. It was always about African-American culture and people \u2013 good, bad, indifferent, whatever \u2013 but that was, for me, the universe.\"\nRegarding the racial environment in which she wrote, Morrison stated, \"Navigating a white male world was not threatening. It wasn't even interesting. I was more interesting than they were. I knew more than they did. And I wasn't afraid to show it.\"\nIn a 1986 interview with Sandi Russell, Morrison stated that she wrote primarily for Black women, explaining, \"I write for black women. We are not addressing the men, as some white female writers do. We are not attacking each other, as both black and white men do. Black women writers look at things in an unforgiving/loving way. They are writing to repossess, re-name, re-own.\"\nIn a 2003 interview, when asked about the labels \"black\" and \"female\" being attached to her work, Morrison replied, \"I can accept the labels because being a black woman writer is not a shallow place but a rich place to write from. It doesn't limit my imagination; it expands it. It's richer than being a white male writer because I know more and I've experienced more.\"\nIn a 1987 article in \"The New York Times\", Morrison argued for the greatness of being a Black woman, stating, \"I really think the range of emotions and perceptions I have had access to as a black person and as a female person are greater than those of people who are neither. I really do. So it seems to me that my world did not shrink because I was a black female writer. It just got bigger.\"\nZadie Smith, paying tribute to \"this infinite terrain\" that Morrison opened up to her as a young black woman, wrote in 2019: \"Morrison rejected the very concept of the narrow door and claimed for herself the wide world. She enriched our literary inheritance, and now every school child, whatever their background, can inherit Morrison as a literary forebear, a great American writer, who is as available to them\u2014as 'universal'\u2014as any other writer in the canon. All readers and writers are indebted to her for the space she created.\"\nNational Memorial for Peace and Justice.\nThe National Memorial for Peace and Justice in Montgomery, Alabama, includes writing by Morrison. Visitors can see her quote after they have walked through the section commemorating individual victims of lynching.\nPapers.\nThe Toni Morrison Papers are part of the permanent library collections of Princeton University, where they are held in the Manuscripts Division, Department of Rare Books and Special Collections. Morrison's decision to offer her papers to Princeton instead of to her alma mater Howard University was criticized by some within the historically black colleges and universities community.\nOpening in February 2023, an exhibition titled \"Toni Morrison: Sites of Memory\", which was curated from her archives at Princeton University, commemorated the 30th anniversary of her winning the Nobel Prize. Running from the week after her birthday until June 4, the exhibition featured rare manuscripts, correspondence between Morrison and others, and unfinished projects, taking its name from a 1995 essay by Morrison in which she spoke of a \"journey to a site to see what remains were left behind and to reconstruct the world that these remains imply.\"\nDay, halls, and school.\nIn 2007, https:// opened in her hometown of Lorain, Ohio. In 2019, a resolution was passed in her hometown of Lorain, Ohio, to designate February 18, her birthday, as Toni Morrison Day. Additional legislation was introduced to also proclaim that date throughout the State of Ohio. The legislation, HB 325, was passed by the Ohio House of Representatives on December 2, 2020, and signed into law by Governor Mike DeWine on December 21.\nIn 2021, Cornell University opened Toni Morrison Hall, a 178,869 square-foot residence hall and Morrison Dining in 2022, an adjacent dining hall designed by ikon.5 Architects.\nDuring December 2023, the Toni Morrison Collective at Cornell University to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Morrison's Nobel win partnered with Calvary Baptist Church to give away free copies of two of Morrison's books and hold book talks in various locations. As explained by Anne V. Adams, professor emerita of Africana studies and comparative literature and chair of the Toni Morrison Collective: \"The fact that Toni Morrison, during her first year as a master's student, lodged at a house just a couple of doors up the street from historic Calvary Baptist Church created a perfect context for a collaboration.\"\nDocumentary films.\nMorrison was interviewed by Margaret Busby in London for a 1988 documentary film by Sindamani Bridglal, entitled \"Identifiable Qualities\", shown on Channel 4.\nMorrison was the subject of a film titled \"Imagine\u00a0\u2013 Toni Morrison Remembers\", directed by Jill Nicholls and shown on BBC One television on July 15, 2015, in which Morrison talked to Alan Yentob about her life and work.\nIn 2016, Oberlin College received a grant to complete a documentary film begun in 2014, \"The Foreigner's Home\", about Morrison's intellectual and artistic vision, explored in the context of the 2006 exhibition she guest-curated at the Louvre. The film's executive producer was Jonathan Demme. It was directed by Oberlin College Cinema Studies faculty Geoff Pingree and Rian Brown, and incorporates footage shot by Morrison's first-born son Harold Ford Morrison, who also consulted on the film.\nIn 2019, Timothy Greenfield-Sanders' documentary \"\" premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. Those featured in the film include Morrison, Angela Davis, Oprah Winfrey, Fran Lebowitz, Sonia Sanchez, and Walter Mosley, among others.\nAwards.\nNomination.\n\"Who's Got Game? The Ant or the Grasshopper? The Lion or the Mouse? Poppy or the Snake?\" was a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for Children nominee in 2008.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 2003, the book was listed on the BBC's The Big Read poll of the UK's \"best-loved novels.\"\nThe novel has been adapted into various other media, including feature films in 1985 and 2023, a 2005 musical, and a 2008 radio serial on \"Woman's Hour\" on BBC Radio 4.\nPlot.\nCelie, a poor African-American girl, lives in rural Georgia in the early 1900s. She writes letters to God because her father Alphonso beats and rapes her. Due to the rape, she gives birth to two children, Olivia and Adam, whom Alphonso takes away. A farmer identified as \"Mister\" (Mr.__) asks to marry her younger sister Nettie, but Alphonso offers him Celie instead. Celie is abused by Mister and mistreated by his prior children. Nettie runs away and stays with Celie, but Mister eventually makes her leave after she refuses his unwanted sexual advances. Nettie promises to write, but Celie never receives any letters, and Celie concludes that she is dead.\nMister's son Harpo marries an assertive girl named Sofia. Celie is impressed by Sofia's self-esteem, but Mister chides Harpo for what he considers weakness in his treatment of Sofia. In a moment of envy, Celie tells Harpo to beat Sofia. Sofia fights back and confronts Celie, who apologizes and confides in her about Mister's abuse.\nShug Avery, a jazz and blues singer and Mister's long-time mistress, moves in. Celie takes care of Shug, who is ill. While Shug is initially rude to Celie, the two become friends and Celie becomes infatuated with Shug. Frustrated by Harpo's domineering behavior, Sofia moves out, taking her children with her. Several months later, Harpo opens a juke joint where a fully recovered Shug performs nightly. Shug begins an affair with Mister. Shug learns that Mister beats Celie, and vows to stay at the house until she is convinced he will stop. Shug and Celie grow closer, and Celie tells Shug that she's never had an orgasm. Shug convinces Celie to look at her vulva in a mirror and teaches her about her clitoris.\nSofia returns for a visit and gets into a fight with Harpo's new girlfriend, Squeak (Mary Agnes). She has a verbal spat with the mayor's wife, Miss Millie, and after the mayor slaps her, she hits him back. She is beaten by the police and sentenced to 12 years in prison. Squeak tricks the warden, her white uncle, into releasing Sofia from prison and having her work as Miss Millie's maid. The plan works, but the warden rapes Squeak. Sofia is released from prison and forced to work for Miss Millie, which she detests. Squeak cares for Sofia's children, and the two women become friends. \nShug returns to town, newly married to a man called Grady. Celie confesses to Shug that her father raped her. While both their husbands are out, Celie and Shug have sex for the first time. Together, they learn that Mister has hidden letters from Nettie for years. In the letters, Nettie says she has befriended a missionary couple, Samuel and Corrine, and gone to Africa with them. Samuel and Corrine had unwittingly adopted Adam and Olivia. Through Samuel's story of the adoption, Nettie learns that Alphonso is her and Celie's stepfather. Their biological father was lynched, and their mother then suffered a mental collapse that Alphonso exploited. Nettie confesses to Samuel and Corrine that she is the children's biological aunt. Corrine, gravely ill, refuses to believe Nettie until Nettie reminds her that she had previously met Celie. Later, Corrine dies, having accepted Nettie's story. \nCelie visits Alphonso, who confirms Nettie's story. Celie confides to Shug that she is losing faith in God; Shug explains to Celie her own unique religious philosophy. Celie, Shug and Squeak decide to leave town; Celie curses Mister before leaving him. They settle in Memphis, Tennessee; Celie starts a pants-making business.\nAlphonso dies. Celie inherits land that rightfully should have been passed down to her and Nettie because it belonged to her biological father and mother. She moves back into her childhood home. Celie is crushed when Shug falls in love with Germaine, a member of her band. Shug travels with Germaine, writing postcards to Celie. Celie pledges to love Shug even if Shug does not love her back. Celie learns that Mister is suffering from a considerable decline in fortunes, and begins calling him by his first name, Albert. Mister proposes that they marry \"in the spirit as well as in the flesh\", but Celie declines.\nNettie and Samuel marry and prepare to return to America. Before they leave, Adam marries Tashi, an African girl. Following tradition, Tashi undergoes female genital mutilation and facial scarring. In solidarity, Adam undergoes the same facial scarring ritual.\nAs Celie realizes that she is content without Shug, Shug returns, having ended her relationship with Germaine. Nettie, Samuel, Olivia, Adam and Tashi arrive at Celie's house. Nettie and Celie reunite after 30 years, introducing one another to their respective families.\nCritical reception.\n\"The Color Purple\" won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1983, making Walker the first black woman to win for fiction; in 1950 Gwendolyn Brooks had won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry. Walker also won the National Book Award for Fiction in 1983. Mel Watkins of the \"New York Times Book Review\" wrote that it is a \"striking and consummately well-written novel\", praising its powerful emotional impact and epistolary structure. It was also named a PBS Great American Read Top 100 Pick.\nThe book received greater scrutiny amidst controversy surrounding the release of the film adaptation in 1985. The controversy centered around the depiction of black men, which some critics saw as feeding stereotypical narratives of black male violence, while others found the representation compelling and relatable.\nOn November 5, 2019, the \"BBC News\" listed \"The Color Purple\" on its list of the 100 most influential novels.\nCensorship in the United States.\nThough the novel has garnered critical acclaim, it has also been the subject of controversy. The American Library Association placed it on the list of top hundred banned and challenged books in the United States from 1990 to 1999 (17), 2000 to 2009 (17), and 2010 to 2019 (50), as well as the top ten list for 2007 (6) and 2009 (9). Commonly cited justifications for banning the book include sexual explicitness, explicit language, violence, and homosexuality.\nAdaptations.\nThe novel was adapted into a film of the same name in 1985. It was directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Whoopi Goldberg as Celie, Danny Glover as Albert, and Oprah Winfrey as Sofia. Though nominated for eleven Academy Awards, it won none. This perceived snubbing ignited controversy because many critics, including Roger Ebert, considered it the best picture of the year.\nOn December 1, 2005, a musical adaptation of the novel and film with lyrics and music by Stephen Bray, Brenda Russell and Allee Willis, and book by Marsha Norman opened at The Broadway Theatre in New York City. The show was produced by Scott Sanders, Quincy Jones, Harvey Weinstein, and Oprah Winfrey, who was also an investor.\nIn 2008, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a radio adaptation of the novel in ten 15-minute episodes as a \"Woman's Hour\" serial with Nadine Marshall as Celie, Nikki Amuka-Bird, Nina Sosanya and Eamonn Walker. The script was by Patricia Cumper and in 2009 the production received the Sony Radio Academy Awards Silver Drama Award.\nIn 2018, Warner Bros. announced that they would be releasing a new film adaptation of \"The Color Purple\", based on the musical. Spielberg and Quincy Jones returned to produce this version, along with the stage musical's producers Scott Sanders and Oprah Winfrey. The film opened on December 25, 2023.\nBoycotting Israel.\nAs part of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement (BDS), the author declined publication of the book in Israel in 2012. This decision was criticized by Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz, who argued that Walker \"resorted to bigotry and censorship against Hebrew-speaking readers of her writings\". In a letter to Yediot Books, Walker stated that she would not allow her book to be published in Israel while the country maintained its system of apartheid.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Commonly known as arrow worms, they are mostly pelagic; however about 20% of the known species are benthic, and can attach to algae and rocks. They are found in all marine waters, from surface tropical waters and shallow tide pools to the deep sea and polar regions. Most chaetognaths are transparent and are torpedo shaped, but some deep-sea species are orange. They range in size from .\nChaetognaths were first recorded by the Dutch naturalist Martinus Slabber in 1775. As of 2021, biologists recognize 133 modern species assigned to over 26 genera and eight families. Despite the limited diversity of species, the number of individuals is large.\nArrow worms are strictly related to and possibly belonging to Gnathifera, a clade of protostomes that do not belong to either Ecdysozoa or Lophotrochozoa.\nAnatomy.\nChaetognaths are transparent or translucent dart-shaped animals covered by a cuticle. They range in length between 1.5 mm to 105 mm in the Antarctic species \"Pseudosagitta gazellae\". Body size, either between individuals in the same species or between different species, seems to increase with decreasing temperature. The body is divided into a distinct head, trunk, and tail. About 80% of the body is occupied by primary longitudinal muscles. \nHead and digestive system.\nThere are between four and fourteen hooked, grasping spines on each side of their head, flanking a hollow vestibule containing the mouth. The spines are used in hunting, and covered with a flexible hood arising from the neck region when the animal is swimming. Spines and teeth are made of \u03b1-chitin, and the head is protected by a chitinous armature. \nThe mouth opens into a muscular pharynx, which contains glands to lubricate the passage of food. From here, a straight intestine runs the length of the trunk to an anus just forward of the tail. The intestine is the primary site of digestion and includes a pair of diverticula near the anterior end. Materials are moved about the body cavity by cilia. Waste materials are simply excreted through the skin and anus. Eukrohniid species possess an oil vacuole closely associated with the gut. This organ contains wax esters which may assist reproduction and growth outside of the production season for \"Eukrohnia hamata\" in Arctic seas. Owing to the position of the oil vacuole in the center of the tractus, the organ may also have implications for buoyancy, trim and locomotion.\nUsually chaetognaths are not pigmented, however the intestines of some deep-sea species contain orange-red carotenoid pigments. \nNervous and sensory systems.\nThe nervous system is reasonably simple and shows a typical protostome anatomy, consisting of a ganglionated nerve ring surrounding the pharynx. The brain is composed of two distinct functional domains: the anterior neuropil domain and the posterior neuropil domain. The former probably controls head muscles moving the spines and the digestive system. The latter is linked to eyes and the corona ciliata. A putative sensory structure of unknown function, the retrocerebral organ, is also hosted by the posterior neuropil domain. The ventral ganglion is the largest, but nerves extend from all the ganglia along the length of the body. \nChaetognaths have two compound eyes, each consisting of a number of pigment-cup ocelli fused together; some deep-sea and troglobitic species have unpigmented or absent eyes. In addition, there are a number of sensory bristles arranged in rows along the side of the body, where they probably perform a function similar to that of the lateral line in fish. An additional, curved, band of sensory bristles lies over the head and neck. Almost all chaetognaths have \"indirect\" or \"inverted\" eyes, according to the orientation of photoreceptor cells; only some Eukhroniidae species have \"direct\" or \"everted\" eyes. A unique feature of the chaetognath eye is the lamellar structure of photoreceptor membranes, containing a grid of 35\u201355 nm wide circular pores.\nA significant mechanosensory system, composed of ciliary receptor organs, detects vibrations, allowing chaetognaths to detect the swimming motion of potential prey. Another organ on the dorsal part of the neck, the corona ciliata, is probably involved in chemoreception.\nInternal organs.\nThe body cavity is lined by peritoneum, and therefore represents a true coelom, and is divided into one compartment on each side of the trunk, and additional compartments inside the head and tail, all separated completely by septa. Although they have a mouth with one or two rows of tiny teeth, compound eyes, and a nervous system, they have no excretory or respiratory systems. While often said to lack a circulatory system, chaetognaths do have a rudimentary hemal system resembling those of annelids.\nThe arrow worm rhabdomeres are derived from microtubules 20\u00a0nm long and 50\u00a0nm wide, which in turn form conical bodies that contain granules and thread structures. The cone body is derived from a cilium.\nLocomotion.\nThe trunk bears one or two pairs of lateral fins incorporating structures superficially similar to the fin rays of fish, with which they are not homologous. Unlike those of vertebrates, these lateral fins are composed of a thickened basement membrane extending from the epidermis. An additional caudal fin covers the post-anal tail. Two chaetognath species, \"Caecosagitta macrocephala\" and \"Eukrohnia fowleri\", have bioluminescent organs on their fins. \nChaetognaths swim in short bursts using a dorso-ventral undulating body motion, where their tail fin assists with propulsion and the body fins with stabilization and steering. Muscle movements have been described as among the fastest in metazoans. Muscles are directly excitable by electrical currents or strong K+ solutions; the main neuromuscular transmitter is acetylcholine.\nReproduction and life cycle.\nAll species are hermaphroditic, carrying both eggs and sperm. Each animal possesses a pair of testes within the tail, and a pair of ovaries in the posterior region of the main body cavity. Immature sperm are released from the testes to mature inside the cavity of the tail, and then swim through a short duct to a seminal vesicle where they are packaged into a spermatophore.\nDuring mating, each individual places a spermatophore onto the neck of its partner after rupture of the seminal vesicle. The sperm rapidly escape from the spermatophore and swim along the midline of the animal until they reach a pair of small pores just in front of the tail. These pores connect to the oviducts, into which the developed eggs have already passed from the ovaries, and it is here that fertilisation takes place. The seminal receptacles and oviducts accumulate and store spermatozoa, to perform multiple fertilisation cycles. Some benthic members of Spadellidae are known to have elaborate courtship rituals before copulation, for example \"Paraspadella gotoi\".\nThe eggs are mostly planktonic, except in a few species such as \"Ferosagitta hispida\" that attaches eggs to the substrate. In \"Eukrohnia\", eggs develop in marsupial sacs or attached to algae. Eggs usually hatch after 1\u20133 days. Chaetognaths do not undergo metamorphosis nor they possess a well-defined larval stage, an unusual trait among marine invertebrates; however there are significant morphological differences between the newborn and the adult, with respect to proportions, chitinous structures and fin development. \nThe life spans of chaetognaths are variable but short; the longest recorded was 15 months in \"Sagitta friderici\".\nBehaviour.\nLittle is known of arrow worms' behaviour and physiology, due to the complexity in culturing them and reconstructing their natural habitat. It is known that they feed more frequently with higher temperatures. Planktonic chaetognaths often must swim continuously, with a \"hop and sink\" behaviour, to keep themselves in the desired location in the water layer, and swim actively to catch prey. They all tend to keep the body slightly slanted with the head pointing downwards. They often show a \"gliding\" behaviour, slowly sinking for a while, and then catching up with a quick movement of their fins. Benthic species usually stay attached to substrates such as rocks, algae or sea grasses, more rarely on top or between sand grains, and act more strictly as ambush predators, staying still until prey passes by. The prey is detected thanks to the ciliary fence and tuft organs, sensing vibrations \u2013 individuals of \"Spadella cephaloptera\" for example will attack a glass or metal probe vibrating at an adequate frequency. To catch prey, arrow worms jump forward with a strong stroke of the tail fin. Once in contact with prey, they withdraw the hood over the grasping spines, so that it forms a cage around the prey and bring it in contact with the mouth. They swallow their prey whole.\nEcology.\nChaetognaths are found in all world's oceans, from the poles to tropics, and also in brackish and estuarine waters. They inhabit very diverse environments, from hydrothermal vents to deep ocean seafloor, to seagrass beds and marine caves. The majority are planktonic, and they are often the second most common component of zooplankton, with a biomass ranging between 10 and 30% that of copepods. In the Canada Basin, chaetognaths alone represent ~13% of the zooplankton biomass. As such, they are ecologically relevant and a key food source for fishes and other predators, including commercially relevant fishes such as mackerel or sardines. 58% of known species are pelagic, while about a third of species are epibenthic or meiobenthic, or inhabit the immediate vicinity of the substrate. Chaetognaths have been recorded up to 5000 and possibly even 6000 meters of depth. \nThe highest density of chaetognaths is observed in the photic zone of shallow waters. Larger chaetognath species tend to live deeper in water, but spend their juvenile stages higher in the water column. Arrow worms however engage in diel vertical migration, spending the day at lower depths to avoid predators, and coming close to the surface at night. Their position in the water column can depend on light, temperature, salinity, age and food supply. They cannot swim against oceanic currents, and they are used as a hydrological indicator of currents and water masses. \nAll chaetognaths are ambush predators, preying on other planktonic animals, mostly copepods and cladocerans but also amphipods, krill and fish larvae. Adults can feed on younger individuals of the same species. Some species are also reported to be omnivores, feeding on algae and detritus. \nChaetognaths are known to use the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin to subdue prey, possibly synthesized by \"Vibrio\" bacterial species.\nGenetics.\nIn 2025, the genome of the arrow worm \"Paraspadella gotoi\" has been published. The genome is 257 Mb long, consists of 9 chromosomes and includes 22.072 protein-coding genes, with 20% of the sequence being occupied by repeats. The genome lacks genes for the centromeric histone H3 and CENPT, both proteins involved in the centromere; a condition associated with faster rearrangements of the genome in other species. Accordingly, genomic analysis indicates a higher rate of chromosomal rearrangement in gnathiferans. The \"P.gotoi\" genome also shows evidence of a significant gene duplication event, probably due to a burst of tandem gene duplication (a rare condition in animal genomes) instead than to a whole genome duplication event, involving 3.379 gene families. Many of these genes are involved in development and ion transmembrane transport. Chaetognaths seem to include as many as 2.250 unique gene families, a large number compared with the 157 unique gene families of Mollusca or 124 unique gene families of Echinodermata. Nearly half the chaetognath genes undergo trans-splicing.\nMitochondrial genome.\nThe mtDNA of the arrow worm \"Spadella cephaloptera\" has been sequenced in 2004, and at the time it was the smallest metazoan mitochondrial genome known, being 11,905 base pairs long (it has now been surpassed by the mitchondrial genome of the ctenophore \"Mnemiopsis leidyi\", which is 10,326 bp long). All mitochondrial tRNA genes are absent. The MT-ATP8 and MT-ATP6 genes are also missing. The mtDNA of \"Paraspadella gotoi\", also sequenced in 2004, is even smaller (11,403 bp) and it shows a similar pattern, lacking 21 of the 22 usually present tRNA genes and featuring only 14 of the 37 genes normally present. \nChaetognaths show a unique mitochondrial genomic diversity within individual of the same species.\nPhylogeny and evolution.\nEvolution and relationship to other animals.\nThe evolutionary relationships of chaetognaths have long been enigmatic. Charles Darwin remarked that arrow worms were \"remarkable for the obscurity of their affinities\". Chaetognaths in the past have been traditionally, but erroneously, classed as deuterostomes by embryologists due to deuterostome-like features in the embryo. Lynn Margulis and K. V. Schwartz placed chaetognaths in the deuterostomes in their \"Five Kingdom\" classification. However, several developmental features are at odds with deuterostomes and are either akin to Spiralia or unique to Chaetognatha.\nMolecular phylogeny shows that Chaetognatha are, in fact, protostomes. Thomas Cavalier-Smith places them in the protostomes in his \"Six Kingdom\" classification. The similarities between chaetognaths and nematodes mentioned above may support the protostome thesis\u2014in fact, chaetognaths are sometimes regarded as a basal ecdysozoan or lophotrochozoan. Chaetognatha appears close to the base of the protostome tree in most studies of their molecular phylogeny. This may explain their deuterostome embryonic characters. If chaetognaths branched off from the protostomes before they evolved their distinctive protostome embryonic characters, they might have retained deuterostome characters inherited from early bilaterian ancestors. Thus chaetognaths may be a useful model for the ancestral bilaterian.\nStudies of arrow worms' nervous systems suggests they should be placed within the protostomes. According to 2017 and 2019 papers, chaetognaths either belong to or are the sister group of Gnathifera.\nIn 2025, the sequencing of \"Paraspadella gotoi\" revealed that chaetognaths underwent both extensive gene loss and gene duplication and feature an unusual number of phylum-specific gene families that seem to have an important role in shaping novel cell types. One of the duplication events involved the Hox cluster, probably playing a role in sculpting the unique chaetognath body plan. Overall, according to researchers, the chaetognath body plan seems to have evolved not by incorporating and adapting the ancestral bilaterian genetic toolkit, but by discarding most of it and then evolving its own new genes, thus explaining at least in part the enigmatic uniqueness of these animals.\nFossil record.\nDue to their soft bodies, chaetognaths fossilize poorly. Even so, several fossil chaetognath species have been described. Chaetognaths first appear during the Cambrian Period. Complete body fossils have been formally described from the Lower Cambrian Maotianshan shales of Yunnan, China (\"Eognathacantha ercainella\" Chen &amp; Huang and \"Protosagitta spinosa\" Hu) and the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale of British Columbia (\"Capinatator praetermissus\".) A Cambrian stem-group chaetognath, \"Timorebestia\", first described in 2024, was much larger than modern species, showing that chaetognaths occupied different roles in marine ecosystems compared to today. A more recent chaetognath, \"Paucijaculum samamithion\" Schram, has been described from the Mazon Creek biota from the Pennsylvanian of Illinois. The enigmatic \"Nectocaris\", documented from the Burgess Shale since 1910 and described in 1976, has been recognized as a stem-chateognath in 2025.\nChaetognaths were thought possibly to be related to some of the animals grouped with the conodonts. The conodonts themselves, however, have been shown to be dental elements of vertebrates. It is now thought that protoconodont elements (e.g., \"Protohertzina anabarica\" Missarzhevsky, 1973), are probably grasping spines of chaetognaths rather than teeth of conodonts. Previously chaetognaths in the Early Cambrian were only suspected from these protoconodont elements, but the more recent discoveries of body fossils have confirmed their presence then. There is evidence that chaetognaths were important components of the oceanic food web already in the Early Cambrian.\nInternal phylogeny.\nBelow is a consensus evolutionary tree of extant Chaetognatha, based on both morphological and molecular data, as of 2021.\nHistory.\nThe first known description of a chaetognath has been published by Dutch naturalist Martinus Slabber in the 1770s; he also coined the name \"arrow worm\". The zoologist Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville also briefly mentioned probable chaetognaths but he understood them as pelagic mollusks. The first description of a currently accepted species of chaetognath, \"Sagitta bipunctata\", is from 1827. Among the early zoologists describing arrow worms, there is Charles Darwin, who took notes about them during the voyage of the \"Beagle\" and in 1844 dedicated a paper to them. In the following year, August David Krohn published an early anatomical description of \"Sagitta bipunctata\".\nThe term \"chaetognath\" has been coined in 1856 by Rudolf Leuckart. He was also the first to propose that the genus \"Sagitta\" belonged to a separate group: \u00abAt the moment, it seems most natural to regard the Sagittas as representatives of a small group of their own that makes the transition from the real annelids (first of all the lumbricines) to the nematodes, and may not be unsuitably named Chaetognathi.\u00bb\nThe modern systematics of Chaetognatha begins in 1911 with Ritter-Z\u00e1hony and is later consolidated by Takasi Tokioka in 1965 and Robert Bieri in 1991. Tokioka introduced the orders Phragmophora and Aphragmophora, and classified four families, six genera, for a total of 58 species \u2013 plus the extinct \"Amiskwia\", classified as a true primitive chaetognath in a separate class, Archisagittoidea.\nChaetognaths were for a while considered as belonging or affine to the deuterostomes, but suspects of their affinities among Spiralia or other protostomes were already present as early as 1986. Their affinities with protostomes were clarified in 2004 by sequencing and analysis of mtDNA.\nInfection by giant viruses.\nIn 2018, reanalysis of electron microscopy photographs from the 1980s allowed scientists to identify a giant virus (\"Meelsvirus\") infecting \"Adhesisagitta hispida\"; its site of multiplication is nuclear and the virions (length: 1.25 \u03bcm) are enveloped. In 2019, reanalysis of other previous studies has shown that structures that were taken in 1967 for bristles present on the surface of the species \"Spadella cephaloptera\", and in 2003, for bacteria infecting \"Paraspadella gotoi\", were in fact enveloped and spindle-shaped giant viruses with a cytoplasmic site of multiplication. The viral species infecting \"P. gotoi\", whose maximum length is 3.1 \u03bcm, has been named \"Klothovirus casanovai\" (\"Klotho\" being the Greek name for one of the three Fates whose attribute was a spindle, and \"casanovai\", in tribute to Pr J.-P. Casanova who devoted a large part of his scientific life to the study of chaetognaths). The other species has been named \"Megaklothovirus horridgei\" (in tribute to Adrian Horridge, the first author of the 1967 article). On a photograph, one of the viruses \"M. horridgei\", although truncated, is 3.9 \u03bcm long, corresponding to about twice the length of the bacteria \"Escherichia coli\". Many ribosomes are present in virions but their origin remains unknown (cellular, viral or only partly viral). To date, giant viruses known to infect metazoans are exceptionally rare.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Marine worms are found in several different phyla, including the Platyhelminthes, Nematoda, Annelida (segmented worms), Chaetognatha, Hemichordata, and Phoronida.\nReproduction.\nMarine worms exhibit numerous types of reproduction, both sexually and asexually. Asexually many are able to reproduce via budding or regeneration. This regeneration is most notably studied in Plathelminths or Triclad, known for being one of the earliest animals to be studied for its regenerative capabilities. Marine worms will also sexually reproduce, internally and externally, with some releasing spawn into the ocean currents. This is in opposition to the much more internal and invasive method displayed by flat-worms called Penis fencing where hermaphroditic organisms will flight to try and impregnate their opponent while avoiding becoming impregnated. This method is driven by the biological disadvantages (such as resource need and energy expenditure) behind carrying offspring instead of the more prolific gene passage through multiple impregnations.\nGenetics and taxonomy.\nPolynoid scale worms are estimated to have arrived in deep sea ecosystems around sixty million years ago. Through the comparison of 120 genes, researchers came to the conclusion that genes related to DNA repair, recombination, and integration were only present in the deep sea polynoidae, which correlates with the idea that they have to adapt to deal with potential hypoxia in deep sea environments.\nFeeding methods.\nMarine worms can be herbivores, carnivores, parasites, detritivores, or filter feeders, but many strange examples of feeding are seen in this diverse type of animal. The group of Siboglinidae have developed a relationship with symbiotic bacteria within their gut that often perform chemosynthesis from which the worm benefits. These bacteria reside in a specialized organ called the Trophosome. Some worms have an extendable pharynx or a proboscis for consuming prey, while others have developed jaws.\nCirculation.\nMarine worms have a variety of circulation and respiration processes. For example, in platyhelminths this is achieved through diffusion of oxygen (as well as other nutrients) across a moist epithelial layer, whereas annelids have a closed circulatory system with blood vessels lining the body.\nMany of these worms have specialized tentacles used for exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide which also may be used for reproduction. These specialized tentacles allow for gas exchange, further decreasing oxygen content in dead zones and in shallow water, which encourages plant and algae growth.\nThis quality is also observed in deeper oceans, where tube worms that use respiratory plumes with tentacles perform gas exchange of hydrogen sulfide and methane around hydrothermal vents. These types of circulatory systems differ from marine worms previously mentioned that can perform gas exchange through their entire bodies. This synapomorphy of gas exchange causes even related terrestrial annelids to be restricted to moist environments.\nEnvironmental niches.\nMarine worms are known to inhabit many different environments, having been found in both fresh and saltwater habitats globally.\nSome marine worms are tube worms, of which the giant tube worm lives in waters near underwater volcanoes and can withstand temperatures up to 90\u00a0\u00b0C (194\u00a0\u00b0F). They share this space with fellow polychaetas known as \"pompeii worms\" that can resist 105\u00a0\u00b0C waters coming out of vents for short periods of time, making them one of the most heat resistant animals ever recorded (Islam and Schulze-Makuch,2007).\nSome worms can live in extremely deep oceanic trenches, such as in the Pacific Ocean off the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands.\nMarine deep sea polychaetes under the genus \"Osedax\" will colonize at whale falls in many different oceans, using a symbiont that can digest the bones within the carcasses (Jones et al,2007) This earned them the common name of \"boneworms,\" and they are speculated to be a keystone species of these types of environments due to lack of organisms in whale falls without observed \"Osedax\" worms. These whale falls remain undigested for many more years than those observed with marine worm cultivations.\nIn recent years, marine worms (especially those found in the ocean) have been observed ingesting microplastic particles found in the oceans. This trend is concerning many scientists, as marine worms act as an important food source for many fish and wading birds. Marine worms are often keystone species in an ecosystem, and the introduction of plastic in the oceans not only diminishes the growth rates of the marine worms, but also affects the food chain of that ecosystem.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "43174", "revid": "20483999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43174", "title": "Cloudinidae", "text": "Group of extinct aquatic animals\nThe cloudinids, an early metazoan family containing the genera Acuticocloudina, Cloudina and Conotubus, lived in the late Ediacaran period about 550 million years ago and became extinct at the base of the Cambrian. They formed millimetre-scale conical fossils consisting of calcareous cones nested within one another; the appearance of the organism itself remains unknown. The name \"Cloudina\" honors the 20th-century geologist and paleontologist Preston Cloud.\nCloudinids comprise two genera: \"Cloudina\" itself is mineralized, whereas \"Conotubus\" is at best weakly mineralized, whilst sharing the same \"funnel-in-funnel\" construction.\nCloudinids had a wide geographic range, reflected in the present distribution of localities in which their fossils are found, and are an abundant component of some deposits. They never appear in the same layers as soft-bodied Ediacaran biota, but the fact that some sequences contain cloudinids and Ediacaran biota in alternating layers suggests that these groups had different environmental preferences. It has been suggested that cloudinids lived embedded in microbial mats, growing new cones to avoid being buried by silt. However no specimens have been found embedded in mats, and their mode of life is still an unresolved question.\nThe classification of the cloudinids has proved difficult: they were initially regarded as polychaete worms, and then as coral-like cnidarians on the basis of what look like buds on some specimens. Current scientific opinion is divided between classifying them as polychaetes and regarding it as unsafe to classify them as members of any broader grouping. In 2020, a new study of pyritized specimens from the Wood Canyon Formation in Nevada showed the presence of Nephrozoan type guts, the oldest on record, supporting the bilaterian interpretation.\nCloudinids are important in the history of animal evolution for two reasons. They are among the earliest and most abundant of the small shelly fossils with mineralized skeletons, and therefore feature in the debate about why such skeletons first appeared in the Late Ediacaran. The most widely supported answer is that their shells are a defense against predators, as some \"Cloudina\" specimens from China bear the marks of multiple attacks, which suggests they survived at least a few of them. The holes made by predators are approximately proportional to the size of the \"Cloudina\" specimens, and \"Sinotubulites\" fossils, which are often found in the same beds, have so far shown no such holes. These two points suggest that predators attacked in a selective manner, and the evolutionary arms race which this indicates is commonly cited as a cause of the Cambrian explosion of animal diversity and complexity.\nMorphology.\n\"Cloudina\" varies in size from a diameter of 0.3 to 6.5\u00a0mm, and 8 to 150\u00a0mm in length. Fossils consist of a series of stacked vase-like calcite tubes, whose original mineral composition is unknown, but inferred to be high-magnesium calcite. Each cone traps a significant pore space beneath it, and stacks eccentrically in the one below. This results in a ridged external appearance. The overall tube is curved or sinuous, and occasionally branches. The tube walls are 8 to 50 micrometers thick, usually lying in the range 10 to 25 \u03bcm. Although it used to be thought that the tubes had test-tube like bases, detailed three-dimensional reconstruction has shown that the tubes had an open base. There is evidence that the tube was flexible.\nClassification.\n\"Cloudina\" was originally classified in 1972 as a member of the Cribricyathea, a class known from the Early Cambrian. Glaessner (1976) accepted this classification and also\nproposed that \"Cloudina\" was similar to the annelid worms, particularly serpulid polychaetes. However, Hahn &amp; Pflug (1985) and Conway Morris \"et al.\". (1990) doubted both Germs' and Glaessner's suggested relationships, and were unwilling to classify it to anything more than its own family, Cloudinidae. Some specimens of \"Cloudina hartmannae\" display budding, which implies asexual reproduction. On this basis Grant (1990) classified \"Cloudina\" as a coral-like cnidarian. Since the tubes had an open base, creating a single living space rather than a series of separate chambers, \"Cloudina\" is more likely to be a stem group polychaete worm, in other words an evolutionary \"aunt\" or \"cousin\" of more recent polychaetes. This interpretation is reinforced by the even distribution of bore-holes made by predators. However, as with so many Ediacaran life forms, there is great debate surrounding its position in the tree of life, and classification between the kingdom and family level may be unwise.\nEcology.\n\"Cloudina\" is frequently found in association with stromatolites, which are limited to shallow water; their isotopic composition suggests that water temperatures were relatively cool. They have also been found in normal sea-floor sediments, suggesting that they were not only restricted to dwelling on microbial mounds. On the other hand, \"Cloudina\" has never been found in the same layers as the soft-bodied Ediacara biota, but \"Cloudina\" and Ediacara biota have been found in alternating layers. This suggests that the two groups of organisms had different environmental preferences.\nIn many \"Cloudina\" specimens the ridges formed by the cones are of varying width, which suggests the organisms grew at a variable rate. Adolf Seilacher suggests that they adhered to microbial mats, and that the growth phases represented the organism keeping pace with sedimentation\u2014growing through new material deposited on it that would otherwise bury it. Kinks in the developing tube are easily explained by the mat falling slightly from the horizontal. Because of its small size, \"Cloudina\" would be expected to be found \"in situ\" in the microbial mat, especially if, as Seilacher suggests, sedimentation built up around it during its lifetime. But all the many specimens discovered to date have only been found having been washed out of their places of growth. A further argument against Seilacher's hypothesis is that the predatory borings found in many specimens are not concentrated at what would be the top end, as one would expect if the animal was mainly buried. An alternative is that the organism dwelt on seaweeds, but until a specimen unquestionably \"in situ\" is discovered, its mode of life remains open to debate.\nThe tubes often appear to form colonies, although they are sometimes found in more isolated situations. The frequent appearance of large and sometimes single-species colonies has been attributed to the lack of significant predation. On the other hand, in some locations up to 20% of \"Cloudina\" fossils contain predatory borings ranging from 15 to 400\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter. The boreholes are rather evenly distributed along the tube length, and some tubes had been bored multiple times\u2014hence the organism could survive attacks, since predators do not attack empty shells. This may indicate that the animal could vary its position in the tube in response to predation, or that it occupied the full length\u2014but not the full width\u2014of the tube. The even distribution is perhaps difficult to reconcile with an infaunal lifestyle, mainly buried in a microbial mat, and adds weight to Miller's suggestion that the animal lived on seaweeds or in a reef environment. If modern-day molluscs are a suitable analogy, the size distribution of the borings suggests that the predator was similar in size to \"Cloudina\".\nFossil findings in the Nama Group, Namibia, suggest that \"Cloudina\" was one of the first reef-building animals, but machine-learning facilitated 3D tomography indicates that the 'reef-forming' fossils are in fact simply aggregations of solitary individuals.\nFossil locations.\n\"Cloudina\" occurred in calcium carbonate rich areas of stromatolite reefs. It is found in association with \"Namacalathus\", which like \"Cloudina\" was \"weakly skeletal\" and solitary, and \"Namapoikia\", which was \"robustly skeletal\" and formed sheets on open surfaces.\nFirst found in the Nama Group in Namibia, \"Cloudina\" has also been reported in Oman, China's Dengying Formation, Canada, Uruguay, Argentina, Antarctica, Brazil, Nevada, central Spain, northwest Mexico and California,\nin west and south Siberia. The \"Cloudina\" fossils found in association with late Precambrian-Early Cambrian anabaritids SSF and tubular agglutinated skeletal fossils \"Platysolenites\" and \"Spirosolenites\" in Siberia.\nPaleontological importance.\nAlthough not the first small shelly fossil to be found, \"Cloudina\" is one of the earliest and most abundant. The evolution of external shells in the Late Ediacaran is thought to be a defence against predators, marking the start of an evolutionary arms race. While predatory borings are common in \"Cloudina\" specimens, no such borings have been found in \"Sinotubulites\", a similar shelly fossil sometimes found in the same beds. In addition, the diameters of borings in \"Cloudina\" are proportional to the sizes of specimens, which suggests that predators were selective about the size of their prey. These two indications that predators attacked selectively suggest the possibility of speciation in response to predation, which is often postulated as a potential cause of the rapid diversification of animals in the Early Cambrian.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are primarily known from their hard, mineralised tooth-like structures called \"conodont elements\" that in life were present in the oral cavity and used to process food. Rare soft tissue remains suggest that they had elongate eel-like bodies with large eyes. Conodonts were a long-lasting group with over 300 million years of existence from the Cambrian (over 500 million years ago) to the beginning of the Jurassic (around 200 million years ago). Conodont elements are highly distinctive to particular species and are widely used in biostratigraphy as indicative of particular periods of geological time.\nDiscovery and understanding of conodonts.\nThe teeth-like fossils of the conodont were first discovered by Heinz Christian Pander and the results published in Saint Petersburg, Russia, in 1856.\nIt was only in the early 1980s that the first fossil evidence of the rest of the animal was found (see below). In the 1990s exquisite fossils were found in South Africa in which the soft tissue had been converted to clay, preserving even muscle fibres. The presence of muscles for rotating the eyes showed definitively that the animals were primitive vertebrates.\nNomenclature and taxonomic rank.\nThrough their history of study, \"conodont\" is a term which has been applied to both the individual fossils and to the animals to which they belonged. The original German term used by Pander was \"conodonten\", which was subsequently anglicized as \"conodonts\", though no formal latinized name was provided for several decades. MacFarlane (1923) described them as an order, Conodontes (a Greek translation), which Huddle (1934) altered to the Latin spelling Conodonta. A few years earlier, Eichenberg (1930) established another name for the animals responsible for conodont fossils: Conodontophorida (\"conodont bearers\"). A few other scientific names were rarely and inconsistently applied to conodonts and their proposed close relatives during 20th century, such as Conodontophoridia, Conodontophora, Conodontochordata, Conodontiformes, and Conodontomorpha.\nConodonta and Conodontophorida are by far the most common scientific names used to refer to conodonts, though inconsistencies regarding their taxonomic rank still persist. Bengtson (1976)'s research on conodont evolution identified three morphological tiers of early conodont-like fossils: protoconodonts, paraconodonts, and \"true conodonts\" (euconodonts). Further investigations revealed that protoconodonts were probably more closely related to chaetognaths (arrow worms) rather than true conodonts. On the other hand, paraconodonts are still considered a likely ancestral stock or sister group to euconodonts.\nThe 1981 \"Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology\" volume on the conodonts (Part W revised, supplement 2) lists Conodonta as the name of both a phylum and a class, with Conodontophorida as a subordinate order for \"true conodonts\". All three ranks were attributed to Eichenberg, and Paraconodontida was also included as an order under Conodonta. This approach was criticized by F\u00e5hraeus (1983), who argued that it overlooked Pander's historical relevance as a founder and primary figure in conodontology. F\u00e5hraeus proposed to retain Conodonta as a phylum (attributed to Pander), with the single class Conodontata (Pander) and the single order Conodontophorida (Eichenberg). Subsequent authors continued to regard Conodonta as a phylum with an ever-increasing number of subgroups.\nWith increasingly strong evidence that conodonts lie within the phylum Chordata, more recent studies generally refer to \"true conodonts\" as the class Conodonta, containing multiple smaller orders. Paraconodonts are typically excluded from the group, though still regarded as close relatives. In practice, Conodonta, Conodontophorida, and Euconodonta are equivalent terms and are used interchangeably.\nConodont elements.\nFor a long time, the function and arrangement of conodont elements was enigmatic, since the whole animal was soft-bodied, with the sole exception of the mineralized elements. Upon the conodont animal's demise, the soft tissues would decompose and the individual conodont elements would separate. However, in instances of exceptional preservation the conodont elements may be recovered in articulation. By closely observing these rare specimens, Briggs \"et al\". (1983) were able to for the first time study the anatomy of the complexes formed by the conodont elements arranged as they were in life. Other researchers have continued to revise and reinterpret this initial description.\nLone elements.\nConodont elements consist of mineralised teeth-like structures of varying morphology and complexity. The evolution of mineralized tissues has been puzzling for more than a century. It has been hypothesized that the first mechanism of chordate tissue mineralization began either in the oral skeleton of conodonts or the dermal skeleton of early agnathans.\nThe element array constituted a feeding apparatus that is radically different from the jaws of modern animals. They are now termed \"conodont elements\" to avoid confusion. The three forms of teeth, i.e., coniform cones, ramiform bars, and pectiniform platforms, probably performed different functions.\nFor many years, conodonts were known only from enigmatic tooth-like microfossils (200 micrometers to 5 millimeters in length), which occur commonly, but not always, in isolation and were not associated with any other fossil. Until the early 1980s, conodont teeth had not been found in association with fossils of the host organism, in a konservat lagerst\u00e4tte. This is because the conodont animal was soft-bodied, thus everything but the teeth was unsuited for preservation under normal circumstances.\nThese microfossils are made of hydroxylapatite (a phosphatic mineral). The conodont elements can be extracted from rock using adequate solvents.\nThey are widely used in biostratigraphy. Conodont elements are also used as paleothermometers, a proxy for thermal alteration in the host rock, because under higher temperatures, the phosphate undergoes predictable and permanent color changes, measured with the conodont alteration index. This has made them useful for petroleum exploration where they are known, in rocks dating from the Cambrian to the Late Triassic.\nFull apparatus.\nThe conodont apparatus may comprise a number of discrete elements, including the spathognathiform, ozarkodiniform, trichonodelliform, neoprioniodiform, and other forms.\nIn the 1930s, the concept of conodont assemblages was described by Hermann Schmidt and by Harold W. Scott in 1934.\nElement types.\nThe arrangement of elements in ozarkodinids and other complex conodonts was first reconstructed from extremely well-preserved taxa by Briggs \"et al.\" (1983), although loosely articulated conodont elements are reported as early as 1971. Conodont elements are organized into three different groups based upon shape. These groups of shapes are termed S, M, and P\u00a0elements.\nThe S and M\u00a0elements are ramiform, elongate, and comb-like structures. An individual element has a single row of many cusps running down the midline along its top side. These conodont elements are arranged towards the animal's anterior oral surface, forming an interlocking basket of cusps within the mouth. Cusp may point out towards the head of the animal, or back towards the tail. The number of S and M\u00a0elements present as well as the direction they point may vary by taxonomic group. M (makellate) elements have a higher position in the mouth and commonly form a symmetrical shape akin to a horseshoe or pick. S\u00a0elements are further divided into three subtypes:\nIn P\u00a0elements, a pectiniform (comb-shaped) row of cusps transitions into a broad flat or ridged platform moving towards the base of the element. Platforms and cusps are only found along one side of the structure. Individual elements oriented vertically and arranged in pairs, with platforms and cusps pointing towards the animal's midline. They occur deeper in the throat than the S and M elements. P\u00a0elements are further divided into two subtypes:\nThe conodont animal.\nAlthough conodont elements are abundant in the fossil record, fossils preserving soft tissues of conodont animals are known from only a few deposits in the world. One of the first possible body fossils of a conodont were those of \"Typhloesus\", an enigmatic animal known from the Bear Gulch limestone in Montana. This possible identification was based on the presence of conodont elements with the fossils of \"Typhloesus\". This claim was disproved, however, as the conodont elements were actually in the creature's digestive area. That animal is now regarded as a possible mollusk related to gastropods. As of 2023, there are only three described species of conodonts that have preserved trunk fossils: \"Clydagnathus windsorensis\" from the Carboniferous aged Granton Shrimp Bed in Scotland, \"Promissum pulchrum\" from the Ordovician aged Soom Shale in South Africa, and \"Panderodus unicostatus\" from the Silurian aged Waukesha Biota in Wisconsin. There are other examples of conodont animals that only preserve the head region, including eyes, of the animals known from the Silurian aged Eramosa site in Ontario and Triassic aged Akkamori section in Japan.\nAccording to these fossils, conodonts had large eyes, fins with fin rays, chevron-shaped muscles and axial line, which were interpreted as notochord or the dorsal nerve cord. While \"Clydagnathus\" and \"Panderodus\" had lengths only reaching , \"Promissum\" is estimated to reach in length, if it had the same proportions as \"Clydagnathus\".\nEcology.\nDiet.\nBecause they are associated with the oral region of the conodont animal, it is accepted that conodont elements are used in the acquisition of food. Two primary hypotheses have arisen as to how this is accomplished. One hypothesis proposed that elements acted as support structures for filamentous soft-tissues. These small filaments (cilia) would be used to filter small planktonic organisms out of the water column, analogous to the cnidoblast cells of a coral or the lophophore of a brachiopod.\nAnother hypothesis contests that the conodont elements were used to actively catch and process prey. S and M\u00a0elements could have been independently movable, allowing prey to be captured in the oral region of the animal. Modern hagfish and lampreys scrape at flesh using keratinous blades supported by a simple but effective pulley-like system, involving a string of muscles around a cartilaginous core. An equivalent system might have been present in conodonts. S and M elements would be able to open and close at will to firmly grasp or pinch at prey, before rotating back to consume the prey element. The blade-like P\u00a0elements deeper in the throat would process the food by slicing against their counterparts like a pair of scissors, or grinding against each other like molar teeth.\nCurrent consensus supports the latter hypothesis in which elements are used for predation, not suspension feeding. One line of evidence for this includes the isometric growth pattern exhibited by S, M, and P\u00a0elements. If the conodont animal relied upon a filter feeding strategy then this growth pattern would not provide the necessary surface area needed to support ciliated tissue as the animal grew. There is some evidence for cartilaginous structures similar to those present in modern jawless fish, which are both predators and scavengers. Wear on some conodont elements suggests that they functioned like teeth, with both wear marks likely created by food as well as by occlusion with other elements.\nIt is possible that multiple feeding strategies may have arisen in different groups of conodonts, as they are a diverse clade. A 2009 paper suggested that the genus \"Panderodus\" may have utilized venom in the acquisition of prey. Evidence of longitudinal grooves are present on some conodont elements associated with the feeding apparatus of this particular animal. These sorts of grooves are analogous to those present in some extant groups of venomous vertebrates.\nLifestyle.\nStudies have concluded that conodonts taxa occupied both pelagic (open ocean) and nektobenthic (swimming above the sediment surface) niches. The preserved musculature suggests that some conodonts (\"Promissum\" at least) were efficient cruisers, but incapable of bursts of speed. Based on isotopic evidence, some Devonian conodonts have been proposed to have been low-level consumers that fed on zooplankton.\nA study on the population dynamics of \"Alternognathus\" has been published. Among other things, it demonstrates that at least this taxon had short lifespans lasting around a month. A study Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca ratios of a population of conodonts from a carbonate platform from the Silurian of Sweden found that the different conodont species and genera likely occupied different trophic niches.\nClassification and phylogeny.\nAffinities.\nAs of 2012[ [update]], scientists classify the conodonts in the phylum Chordata on the basis of their fins with fin rays, chevron-shaped muscles and notochord.\nMilsom and Rigby envision them as vertebrates similar in appearance to modern hagfish and lampreys, and phylogenetic analysis suggests they are more derived than either of these groups. However, this analysis comes with one caveat: the earliest conodont-like fossils, the protoconodonts, appear to form a distinct clade from the later paraconodonts and euconodonts. Protoconodonts are probably not relatives of true conodonts, but likely represent a stem group to Chaetognatha, an unrelated phylum that includes arrow worms.\nMoreover, some analyses do not regard conodonts as either vertebrates or craniates, because they lack the main characteristics of these groups. More recently it has been proposed that conodonts may be stem-cyclostomes, more closely related to hagfish and lampreys than to jawed vertebrates, based on similarities in the shape of their fins, and the idea that the conodont elements may be homologous with lamprey and hagfish tooth plates.\nIngroup relations.\nIndividual conodont elements are difficult to classify in a consistent manner, but an increasing number of conodont species are now known from multi-element assemblages, which offer more data to infer how different conodont lineages are related to each other. The following is a simplified cladogram based on Sweet and Donoghue (2001), which summarized previous work by Sweet (1988) and Donoghue et al. (2000):\nOnly a few studies approach the question of conodont ingroup relationships from a cladistic perspective, as informed by phylogenetic analyses. One of the broadest studies of this nature was the analysis of Donoghue et al. (2008), which focused on \"complex\" conodonts (Prioniodontida and other descendant groups):\nEvolutionary history.\nThe earliest fossils of conodonts are known from the Cambrian period. Conodonts extensively diversified during the early Ordovician, reaching their apex of diversity during the middle part of the period, and experienced a sharp decline during the late Ordovician and Silurian, before reaching another peak of diversity during the mid-late Devonian. Conodont diversity declined during the Carboniferous, with an extinction event at the end of the middle Tournaisian and a prolonged period of significant loss of diversity during the Pennsylvanian. Only a handful of conodont genera were present during the Permian, though diversity increased after the P-T extinction during the Early Triassic.\nDiversity continued to decline during the Middle and Late Triassic, culminating in their extinction soon after the Triassic-Jurassic boundary. Much of their diversity during the Paleozoic was likely controlled by sea levels and temperature, with the major declines during the Late Ordovician and Late Carboniferous due to cooler temperatures, especially glacial events and associated marine regressions which reduced continental shelf area. However, their final demise is more likely related to biotic interactions, perhaps competition with new Mesozoic taxa.\nTaxonomy.\nConodonta taxonomy based on Sweet (1988), Sweet &amp; Donoghue (2001), and Mikko's Phylogeny Archive.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They inhabit sand and mud beneath shallow coastal waters and can survive in relatively anoxic environments. They were first recognised and described in 1956.\nAnatomy.\nMost gnathostomulids measure in length. They are often slender to thread-like worms, with a generally transparent body. In many Bursovaginoidea, one of the major group of gnathostomulids, the neck region is slightly narrower than the rest of the body, giving them a distinct head.\nLike flatworms they have a ciliated epidermis, but in contrast to flatworms, they have one cilium per cell. The cilia allow the worms to glide along in the water between sand grains, although they also use muscles, allowing the body to twist or contract, for movement.\nThey have no body cavity, and no circulatory or respiratory system. The nervous system is simple, and restricted to the outer layers of the body wall. The only sense organs are modified cilia, which are especially common in the head region.\nThe mouth is located just behind the head, after a rostrum, on the underside of the body. It has a pair of cuticular jaws, supplied by strong muscles, and often bearing minute teeth. A \"basal plate\" on the lower surface that bears a comb-like structure is also present. The basal plate is used to scrape smaller organisms off of the grains of sand that make up their anoxic seabed mud habitat. This bilaterally symmetrical pharynx with its complex cuticular mouth parts make them appear closely related to rotifers and their allies, together making up the Gnathifera. The ultrastructure of the jaws made of rods with electron dense core in transmission electron microscopy sections also support their close relation with Rotifera and Micrognathozoa. The mouth opens into a blind-ending tube in which digestion takes place; there is no true anus. However, there is tissue connecting the intestine to the epidermis which may serve as an anal pore.\nReproduction.\nGnathostomulids are simultaneous hermaphrodites. Each individual possesses a single ovary and one or two testes. After fertilization, the single egg ruptures through the body wall and adheres to nearby sand particles; the parent is able to rapidly heal the resulting wound. The egg hatches into a miniature version of the adult, without a larval stage.\nTaxonomy.\nThere are approximately 100 described species and certainly many more as yet undescribed. The known species are grouped in two orders. The filospermoids are very long and are characterized by an elongate rostrum. The bursovaginoids have paired sensory organs and are characterized by the presence of a penis and a sperm-storage organ called a bursa.\nGnathostomulids have no known fossil record, though there are (debatable) similarities between the jaws of modern gnathostomulids and certain conodont elements. (Ochietti &amp; Cailleux, 1969; Durden et al, 1969)\nThey appear to be a sister clade to the Syndermata.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

When he was six, he started on piano, then at eleven switched to guitar. He later began playing in rock and soul bands. In 1976, he won an award at the Reno Jazz Festival. At Princeton University, he studied music theory and composition with Milton Babbitt and computer music with Paul Lansky. He also took freshman calculus with Edward Nelson. While at Princeton, he played also with Benny Carter and Dizzy Gillespie.\nIn 1985, Bruce Lundvall became president of Blue Note Records and Stanley Jordan was the first person he signed. The label released his album \"Magic Touch\", which sat at No.1 on \"Billboard\"'s jazz chart for 51 weeks, setting a record.\nTouch technique.\nNormally, a guitarist uses two hands to play each note. One hand presses down a guitar string behind a chosen fret to prepare the note, and the other hand either plucks or strums the string to play that note. Jordan's touch technique is an advanced form of two-handed tapping. The guitarist produces a note using only one finger by quickly tapping (or hammering) his finger down on the appropriate fret. The impact causes the string to vibrate enough to sound the note, and the volume can be controlled by varying the force of impact. Jordan taps with both hands, and more legato than is normally associated with guitar tapping. His technique allows the guitarist to play melody and chords simultaneously. It is also possible, as he has demonstrated, to play simultaneously on two different guitars, as well as guitar and piano.\nHe plays guitar in all-fourths tuning, from bass to treble EADGCF (all in perfect fourths as on the bass guitar) rather than the standard EADGBE. He has stated that all-fourths tuning \"simplifies the fingerboard, making it logical\".\nJordan's main guitar was built by Vigier Guitars in 1984: it is an Arpege model on which Vigier made a flat fingerboard, allowing it to have a very low action (0.5/0.7mm). The low action facilitates the tapping technique.\nRecording.\nAmong the artists Jordan has worked with are Quincy Jones, Stanley Clarke, Onaje Allan Gumbs, Michal Urbaniak, Richie Cole, The Dave Matthews Band, The String Cheese Incident, Phil Lesh, Moe, and Umphrey's McGee.\nHe has performed at many jazz festivals, including Kool Jazz Festival (1984), Concord Jazz Festival (1985), and the Montreux International Jazz Festival (1985).\nIn 2004, he released the album \"Dreams of Peace\" with the Italian band Novecento. The album was produced by Lino Nicolosi and Pino Nicolosi at Nicolosi Productions and was released in the U.S. on Favored Nations. He signed with Mack Avenue Records and released \"State of Nature\" in 2008 and \"Friends\" in 2011. The latter was nominated for an NAACP Image Award. He has four Grammy nominations.\nJordan made the startup sound for the Macintosh computer models the Power Macintosh 6100, Power Macintosh 7100, and Power Macintosh 8100.\nFilm and television.\nJordan made a cameo appearance in the movie \"Blind Date\" (1987). In 1995 he wrote the score for the short film \"One Red Rose\". In 1996 he wrote the score for the ABC TV afternoon special, \"Daddy's Girl\".\nSince the mid-1980s he has performed on numerous television shows, including \"The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson\", \"The David Letterman Show\" and \"the Grammy Awards\".\nPersonal life.\nStanley Jordan was briefly married and has one daughter, Julia Jordan, who is a singer and songwriter.\nIn a 2023 interview, Jordan praised author and then-presidential candidate Marianne Williamson for \"bringing politics into the 21st-century\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are at least considered as being lophotrochozoan, and possibly being lophophorates, a group which includes the brachiopods (hyoliths may even be brachiopods themselves), while others consider them as being basal lophotrochozoans, or even molluscs.\nMorphology.\nThe shell of a hyolith is typically one to four centimeters in length, triangular or elliptical in cross section. Some species have rings or stripes. It comprises two parts: the main conical shell (previously referred to as a 'conch') and a cap-like operculum. Some also had two curved supports known as \"helens\" They are calcareous \u2013 probably aragonitic All of these structures grew by marginal accretion.\nShell microstructure.\nThe orthothecid shell has an internal layer with a microstructure of transverse bundles, and an external layer comprising longitudinal bundles.\nHelens.\nSome hyoliths had helens, long structures that taper as they coil gently in a logarithmic spiral in a ventral direction. The helens had an organic-rich central core surrounded by concentric laminae of calcite. They grew by the addition of new material at their base, on the cavity side, leaving growth lines.\nThey were originally described by Walcott as separate fossils under the genus name \"Helenia\" (Walcott's wife was named Helena and his daughter Helen); Bruce Runnegar adopted the name helen when they were recognized as part of the hyolith organism. Encrusting organisms have been found on helens, and also on both sides of the main shell, all of which are therefore supposed to have been raised above the sea bed. The helens have been interpreted as props that supported the feeding organ, the lophophore, above the sea bed.\nOperculum.\nThe operculum closes over the aperture of the shell, leaving (in hyolithids) two gaps through which the helens can protrude. It comprises two parts: the cardinal shield, a flat region at the top of the shell; and the conical shield, the bottom part, which is more conical. The inside of the shell[] bears a number of protrusions, notably the dorsal cardinal processes and the radially-arranged clavicles.\nSoft tissues.\nThe soft tissues of the mid-Cambrian hyolith \"Haplophrentis\", from the Burgess Shale and Spence Shale Lagerst\u00e4tten include a gullwing-shaped band below the operculum. This band is interpreted as a lophophore, a feeding organ with a central mouth; it bears 12 to 16 tentacles. From the mouth a muscular pharynx leads to a gut, which loops back and exits beyond the crown of tentacles. Next to the gut are a pair of large kidney-shaped organs of uncertain nature. Under the operculum are muscles. The thin body wall circumscribes the interior of the shell, except the apex. Preserved intestines have been described from the Ordovician hyolith \"Girvanolithes thraivensis\".\nTaxonomy.\nThe hyoliths are divided into two orders, the Hyolithida and the Orthothecida.\nHyolitha have dorso-ventrally differentiated opercula, with the ventral surface of the shell extending forwards to form a shelf termed the ligula.\nThe Orthothecida are somewhat more problematic, and probably contain a number of non-hyoliths simply because they are so difficult to identify with confidence, especially if their operculum is absent. They have a straight (planar) opening, sometimes with a notch on the bottom side, and sealed with an operculum that has no ligula, clavicles, furrow or rooflets.\n\"Hyptiotheca\" is an unusual hyolithid, in that it lacks clavicles.\nOrthothecids fall into two groups: one, the orthothecida \"sensu stricto\", is kidney or heart shaped in cross-section due to a longitudinal groove on its ventral surface, and its opercula bear cardinal processes; the other has a rounded cross-section and often lacks cardinal processes, making them difficult to distinguish from other cornet-shaped calcareous organisms. All were sessile and benthic; some may have been filter feeders.\nPhylogenetic position.\nBecause hyoliths are extinct and do not obviously resemble any extant group, it has long been unclear which living group they are most closely related to. They have been supposed to be molluscs; or to belong to their own phylum in an unspecified part of the phylogenetic tree. Their grade of organization was historically considered to be of the 'mollusc-annelid-sipunculid' level, consistent with a Lophotrochozoan affinity, and comparison was primarily drawn with the molluscs or sipunculids. Older studies (predating the Lophotrochozoan concept) consider hyoliths to represent a stem lineage of the clade containing (Mollusca + Annelida + Arthropoda).\nA secure classification at last became possible in 2017, on the basis of Burgess Shale specimens that preserve lophophores. This diagnostic characteristic demonstrates an affinity with the Lophophorata, a group that contains Brachiopoda, Bryozoa (perhaps), and Phoronida.\nA study in 2019 estimated that hyoliths are more likely to be basal members of the lophotrochozoans rather than lophophorates. Meanwhile, a study in 2020 instead concluded that hyoliths belong to Mollusca, as did a different study in 2022.\nEcology.\nHyolithids were benthic (bottom-dwellers), using their helens as stilts to hold the opening of their shells above the sea floor. Orthothecids did not have helens, but are presumed to have been sessile and benthic.\nIn the Cambrian, their global distribution shows no sign of provinciality, suggesting a long-lived planktonic larval life stage (reflected by their protoconchs); but by the Ordovician distinct assemblages were becoming evident.\nSome orthothecids are preserved in vertical [life] orientation, suggesting a sessile suspension-feeding habit; hyolithids tend to be flat on the bottom, and their shape and the occurrence of epibionts are consistent with a sessile suspension feeding habit via orientation relative to passive currents.\nOccurrence.\nThe first hyolith fossils appeared about https://\u00a0million years ago in the \"Purella antiqua\" Zone of the Nemakit-Daldynian Stage of Siberia and in its analogue the \"Paragloborilus subglobosus\u2013Purella squamulosa\" Zone of the Meishucunian Stage of China. Hyolith abundance and diversity attain a maximum in the Cambrian, followed by a progressive decline up to their Permian extinction.\nSimilar organisms.\nDue to the simple shape of their shell, hyoliths have been something of a wastebasket taxon, and organisms originally interpreted as hyoliths have sometimes later been recognized as something else \u2013 as for example in the case of the cnidarian-like \"Glossolites\" and \"Palaeoconotuba\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are panarthropods with stubby legs called lobopods, a term which may also be used as a common name of this group as well. While the definition of lobopodians may differ between literatures, it usually refers to a group of soft-bodied, marine (and freshwater) worm-like fossil panarthropods such as \"Aysheaia\" and \"Hallucigenia\". However, other genera like \"Kerygmachela\" and \"Pambdelurion\" (which have features similar to other groups) are often referred to as \"gilled lobopodians\".\nThe oldest near-complete fossil lobopodians date to the Lower Cambrian; some are also known from Ordovician, Silurian and Carboniferous Lagerst\u00e4tten. Some bear toughened claws, plates or spines, which are commonly preserved as carbonaceous or mineralized microfossils in Cambrian strata. The grouping is considered to be paraphyletic, as the three living panarthropod groups (Arthropoda, Tardigrada and Onychophora) are thought to have evolved from lobopodian ancestors.\nDefinitions.\nThe lobopodian concept varies from author to author. Its most general sense refers to a suite of mainly Cambrian worm-like panarthropod taxa possessing lobopods \u2013 for example, \"Aysheaia\", \"Hallucigenia\", and \"Xenusion\" \u2013 which were traditionally united as \"Xenusians\" or \"Xenusiids\" (class Xenusia). Certain Dinocaridid genera, such as \"Opabinia\", \"Pambdelurion\", and \"Kerygmachela\", may also be regarded as lobopodians, sometimes referred to more specifically as \"gilled lobopodians\" or \"gilled lobopods\". This traditional, informal usage of \"Lobopodia\" treats it as an evolutionary grade, including only extinct Panarthropods near the base of crown Panarthropoda. Crown Panarthropoda comprises the three extant Panarthropod phyla \u2013 Onychophora (velvet worms), Tardigrada (waterbears), and Arthropoda (arthropods) \u2013 as well as their most recent common ancestor and all of its descendants. Thus, in this usage, Lobopodia consists of various basal Panarthropods. This corresponds to \"A\" in the image to the left.\nAn alternative, broader definition of Lobopodia would also incorporate Onychophora and Tardigrada, the two living panarthropod phyla which still bear lobopodous limbs. This definition, corresponding to \"C\", is a morphological one, depending on the superficial similarity of appendages (the \"lobopods\"). Thus, it is paraphyletic, excluding the euarthropods, which are descendants of certain lobopodians, on the basis of their highly divergent limb morphology. \"Lobopodia\" has also been used to refer to a proposed sister clade to Arthropoda, consisting of the extant Onychophora and Tardigrada, as well as their most recent common ancestor and all of its descendants. This definition renders Lobopodia a monophyletic taxon, if indeed it is valid (that is, if Tardigrades and Onychophora are closer to one another than either is to Arthropoda), but would exclude all the euarthropod-line taxa traditionally considered lobopodians. Its validity is uncertain, however, as there are a number of hypotheses regarding the internal phylogeny of Panarthropoda. The broadest definition treats Lobopodia as a monophyletic superphylum equivalent in circumscription to Panarthropoda. By this definition, represented by \"D\" in the image, Lobopodia is no longer treated as an evolutionary grade but as a clade, containing not only the early, superficially \"lobopodian\" forms but also all of their descendants, including the extant Panarthropods.\nLobopodia has, historically, sometimes included Pentastomida, a group of parasitic panarthropods which were traditionally thought to be a unique phylum, but revealed by subsequent phylogenomic and anatomical studies to be a highly specialized taxon of crustaceans.\nRepresentative taxa.\nThe better-known genera include \"Aysheaia\", which was discovered in the Canadian Burgess Shale, and \"Hallucigenia\", known from both the Chenjiang Maotianshan Shale and the Burgess Shale. \"Aysheaia pedunculata\" has a morphology apparently basic for lobopodians \u2014 for example, a significantly annulated cuticle, a terminal mouth opening, specialized frontalmost appendages, and stubby lobopods with terminal claws. \"Hallucigenia sparsa\" is famous for having a complex history of interpretation \u2014 it was originally reconstructed with long, stilt-like legs and mysterious fleshy dorsal protuberances, and was long considered a prime example of the way in which nature experimented with the most diverse and bizarre body designs during the Cambrian. However, further discoveries showed that this reconstruction had placed the animal upside-down: interpreting the \"stilts\" as dorsal spines made it clear that the fleshy \"dorsal\" protuberances were actually elongated lobopods. More recent reconstruction even exchanged the front and rear ends of the animal: it was revealed that the bulbous imprint previously thought to be a head was actually gut contents being expelled from the anus.\n\"Microdictyon\" is another charismatic as well as the speciose genus of lobopodians resembling \"Hallucigenia\", but instead of spines, it bore pairs of net-like plates, which are often found disarticulated and are known as an example of small shelly fossils (SSF). \"Xenusion\" has the oldest fossil record amongst the described lobopodians, which may trace back to Cambrian Stage 2. \"Luolishania\" is an iconic example of lobopodians with multiple pairs of specialized appendages. The gill lobopodians \"Kerygmachela\" and \"Pambdelurion\" shed light on the relationship between lobopodians and arthropods, as they have both lobopodian affinities and characteristics linked to the arthropod stem-group.\nMorphology.\nMost lobopodians were only a few centimeters in length, while some genera grew up to over 20\u00a0centimeters. Their bodies are annulated, although the presence of annulation may differ between position or taxa, and sometimes difficult to discern due to their close spacing and low relief on the fossil materials. Body and appendages are circular in cross-section.\nHead.\nDue to the usually poor preservation, detailed reconstructions of the head region are only available for a handful of lobopodian species. The head of a lobopodian is more or less bulbous, and sometime possesses a pair of pre-ocular, presumely protocerebral appendages \u2013 for example, primary antennae or well-developed frontal appendages, which are individualized from the trunk lobopods (with the exception of \"Antennacanthopodia\", which have two pairs of head appendages instead of one). Mouthparts may consist of rows of teeth or a conical proboscis. The eyes may be represented by a single ocellus or by numerous pairs of simple ocelli, as has been shown in \"Luolishania\" (=\"Miraluolishania\"), \"Ovatiovermis\", \"Onychodictyon\", \"Hallucigenia\", \"Facivermis\", and less certainly \"Aysheaia\" as well. However, in gilled lobopodians like \"Kerygmachela\", the eyes are relatively complex reflective patches that may had been compound in nature.\nTrunk and lobopods.\nThe trunk is elongated and composed of numerous body segments (somites), each bearing a pair of legs called lobopods or lobopodous limbs. The segmental boundaries are not as externally significant as those of arthropods, although they are indicated by heteronomous annulations (i.e., the alternation of annulation density corresponding to the position of segmental boundaries) in some species. The trunk segments may bear other external, segment-corresponding structures such as nodes (e.g. \"Hadranax\", \"Kerygmachela\"), papillae (e.g. \"Onychodictyon\"), spine/plate-like sclerites (e.g. armoured lobopodians) or lateral flaps (e.g. gilled lobopodians). One member of Lobopodia, \"Palaeocampa\", has spines which seem to have been poisonous as shown by preserved exudates at their tips, with FTIR (Fourier-transform spectrometry analysis) showing the secretions likely contained aldehydes. The trunk may terminate with a pair of lobopods (e.g. \"Aysheaia\", \"Hallucigenia sparsa\") or a tail-like extension (e.g. \"Paucipodia\", \"Siberion\", \"Jianshanopodia\").\nThe lobopods are flexible and loosely conical in shape, tapering from the body to tips that may or may not bear claws. The claws, if present, are hardened structures with a shape resembling a hook or gently curved spine. Claw-bearing lobopods usually have two claws, but single claws are known (e.g. posterior lobopods of luolishaniids), as are more than two (e.g. three in \"Tritonychus\", seven in \"Aysheaia\") depending on its segmental or taxonomical association. In some genera, the lobopods bear additional structures such as spines (e.g. \"Diania\"), fleshy outgrowths (e.g. \"Onychodictyon\"), or tubercules (e.g. \"Jianshanopodia\"). There is no sign of arthropodization (development of a hardened exoskeleton and segmental division on panarthropod appendages) in known members of lobopodians, even for those belonging to the arthropod stem-group (e.g. gilled lobopodians and siberiids), and the suspected case of arthropodization on the limbs of \"Diania\" is considered to be a misinterpretation.\nDifferentiation (tagmosis) between trunk somites barely occurs, except in hallucigeniids and luolishaniids, where numerous pairs of their anterior lobopods are significantly slender (hallucigeniids) or setose (luolishaniids) in contrast to their posterior counterparts.\nInternal structures.\nThe gut of lobopodians is often straight, undifferentiated, and sometimes preserved in the fossil record in three dimensions. In some specimens the gut is found to be filled with sediment. The gut consists of a central tube occupying the full length of the lobopodian's trunk, which does not change much in width - at least not systematically. However, in some groups, specifically the gilled lobopodians and siberiids, the gut is surrounded by pairs of serially repeated, kidney-shaped gut diverticulae (digestive glands). In some specimens, parts of the lobopodian gut can be preserved in three dimensions. This cannot result from phosphatisation, which is usually responsible for 3-D gut preservation, because the phosphate content of the guts is under 1%; the contents comprise quartz and muscovite. The gut of the representative \"Paucipodia\" is variable in width, being widest at the centre of the body. Its position in the body cavity is only loosely fixed, so flexibility is possible.\nNot much is known about the neural anatomy of lobopodians due to the spare and mostly ambiguous fossil evidence. Possible traces of a nervous system were found in \"Paucipodia\", \"Megadictyon\" and \"Antennacanthopodia\". The first and so far the only confirmed evidence of lobopodian neural structures comes from the gilled lobopodian \"Kerygmachela\" in Park et al. 2018 \u2014 it presents a brain composed of only a protocerebrum (the frontal-most cerebral ganglion of panarthropods) that is directly connected to the nerves of eyes and frontal appendages, suggesting the protocerebral ancestry of the head of lobopodians as well as the whole Panarthropoda.\nIn some extant ecdysozoan such as priapulids and onychophorans, there is a layer of outermost circular muscles and a layer of innermost longitudinal muscles. The onychophorans also have a third, intermediate, layer of interwoven oblique muscles. Musculature of the gilled lobopodian \"Pambdelurion\" shows a similar anatomy, but that of the lobopodian \"Tritonychus\" shows the opposite pattern: it is the outermost muscles that are longitudinal and the innermost layer that consists of circular muscles.\nCategories.\nBased on external morphology, lobopodians may fall under different categories \u2014 for example the general worm-like taxa as \"xenusiid\" or \"xenusian\"; xenusiid with sclerite as \"armoured lobopodians\"; and taxa with both robust frontal appendages and lateral flaps as \"gilled lobopodians\". Some of them were originally defined under a taxonomic sense (e.g. class Xenusia), but neither any of them are generally accepted as monophyletic in further studies.\nArmoured lobopodians.\nArmoured lobopodians referred to xenusiid lobopodians which bore repeated sclerites such as spine or plates on their trunk (e.g. \"Hallucigenia\", \"Microdictyon\", \"Luolishania\") or lobopods (e.g. \"Diania\"). In contrast, lobopodians without sclerites may be referred to as \"unarmoured lobopodians\". Function of the sclerites were interpreted as protective armor and/or muscle attachment points. In some cases, only the disarticulated sclerites of the animal were preserved, which represented as component of small shelly fossils (SSF). Armoured lobopodians were suggest to be onychophoran-related and may even represent a clade in some previous studies, but their phylogenetic positions in later studies are controversial. (see text)\nGilled lobopodians.\nDinocaridids with lobopodian affinities (due to shared features like annulation and lobopods) are referred to as \"gilled lobopodians\" or \"gilled lobopods\". These forms sport a pair of flaps on each trunk segment, but otherwise no signs of arthropodization, in contrast to more derived dinocaridids like the Radiodonta that have robust and sclerotized frontal appendages. Gilled lobopodians cover at least four genera: \"Pambdelurion\", \"Kerygmachela\", \"Utahnax\" and \"Mobulavermis\". \"Opabinia\" may also fall under this category in a broader sense, although the presence of lobopods in this genus is not definitively proven. \"Omnidens\", a genus known only from \"Pambdelurion\"-like mouthparts and distal parts of the frontal appendages, may also be a gilled lobopodian. The body flaps may have functioned as both swimming appendages and gills, and are possibly homologous to the dorsal flaps of radiodonts and exites of Euarthropoda. Whether these genera were true lobopodians is still contested by some. However, they are widely accepted as stem-group arthropods just basal to radiodonts.\n\"Siberion\" and similar taxa.\n\"Siberion\", \"Megadictyon\" and \"Jianshanopodia\" may be grouped as siberiids (order Siberiida), jianshanopodians or \"giant lobopodians\" by some literatures. They are generally large \u2014 body length ranging from \u2014 xenusiid lobopodians with widen trunk, stout trunk lobopods without evidence of claws, and most notably a pair of robust frontal appendages. With the possible exception of \"Siberion\", they also have digestive glands like those of a gilled lobopodian and basal euarthropod. Their anatomy represent transitional forms between typical xenusiids and gilled lobopodians, eventually placing them under the basalmost position of arthropod stem-group.\nPaleoecology.\nLobopodians possibly occupied a wide range of ecological niches. Although most of them had undifferentiated appendages and straight gut, which would suggest a simple sediment-feeding lifestyle, sophisticated digestive glands and large size of gilled lobopodians and siberiids would allow them to consume larger food items, and their robust frontal appendages may even suggest a predatory lifestyle. On the other hand, luolishaniids such as \"Luolishania\" and \"Ovatiovermis\" have elaborate feather-like lobopods that presumably formed 'baskets' for suspension or filter-feeding. Lobopods with curved terminal claws may have given some lobopodians the ability to climb on harder substrates like rocks, sponges, or animal carcasses.\nNot much is known about the physiology of lobopodians. There is evidence to suggest that lobopodians moult just like other ecdysozoan taxa, but the outline and ornamentation of the harden sclerite did not vary during ontogeny. The gill-like structures on the body flaps of gilled lobopodians and ramified extensions on the lobopods of \"Jianshanopodia\" may provide respiratory function (gills). \"Pambdelurion\" may control the movement of their lobopods in a way similar to onychophorans.\nDistribution.\nDuring the Cambrian, lobopodians displayed a substantial degree of biodiversity. One species is known from each of the Ordovician and Silurian periods, with a few more known from the Carboniferous (Mazon Creek) \u2014 this represents the paucity of exceptional lagerstatten in post-Cambrian deposits.\nPhylogeny.\nThe overall phylogenetic interpretation on lobopodians has changed dramatically since their discovery and first description. The reassignments are not only based on new fossil evidence, but also new embryological, neuroanatomical, and genomic (e.g. gene expression, phylogenomics) information observed from extant panarthropod taxa.\nBased on their apparently onychophoran-like morphology (e.g. annulated cuticle, lobopodous appendage with claws), lobopodians were originally thought to be present a group of paleozoic onychophorans. This interpretation was challenged after the discovery of lobopodians with arthropod and tardigrade-like characteristics, suggesting that the similarity between lobopodians and onychophorans represents deeper panarthropod ancestral traits (plesiomorphies) instead of onychophoran-exclusive characteristics (synapomorphies). For example, The British palaeontologist Graham Budd sees the Lobopodia as representing a basal grade from which the phyla Onychophora and Arthropoda arose, with \"Aysheaia\" comparable to the ancestral plan, and with forms like \"Kerygmachela\" and \"Pambdelurion\" representing a transition that, via the dinocaridids, would lead to an arthropod body plan. Aysheaia's surface ornamentation, if homologous with palaeoscolecid sclerites, may represent a deeper link connecting it with cycloneuralian outgroups. Lobopodians are paraphyletic, and include the last common ancestor of arthropods, onychophorans and tardigrades.\nStem-group arthropods.\nCompared to other panarthropod stem-groups, suggestion on the lobopodian members of arthropod stem-group is relatively consistent \u2014 siberiid like \"Megadictyon\" and \"Jianshanopodia\" occupied the basalmost position, gilled lobopodians \"Pambdelurion\" and \"Kerygmachela\" branch next, and finally lead to a clade compose of \"Opabinia\", Radiodonta and Euarthropoda (crown-group arthropods). Their positions within arthropod stem-group are indicated by numerous arthropod groundplans and intermediate forms (e.g. arthropod-like digestive glands, radiodont-like frontal appendages and dorso-ventral appendicular structures link to arthropod biramous appendages). Lobopodian ancestry of arthropods also reinforced by genomic studies on extant taxa \u2014 gene expression support the homology between arthropod appendages and onychophoran lobopods, suggests that modern less-segmented arthropodized appendages evolved from annulated lobopodous limbs. On the other hand, primary antennae and frontal appendages of lobopodians and dinocaridids may be homologous to the labrum/hypostome complex of euarthropods, an idea support by their protocerebral origin and developmental pattern of the labrum of extant arthropods.\n\"Diania\", a genus of armoured lobopodian with stout and spiny legs, were originally thought to be associated within the arthropod stem-group based on its apparently arthropod-like (arthropodized) trunk appendages. However, this interpretation is questionable as the data provided by the original description are not consistent with the suspected phylogenic relationships. Further re-examination even revealed that the suspected arthropodization on the legs of \"Diania\" was a misinterpretation \u2014 although the spine may have hardened, the remaining cuticle of \"Diania\"'s legs were soft (not harden nor scleritzed), lacking any evidence of pivot joint and arthrodial membrane, suggest the legs are lobopods with only widely spaced annulations. Thus, the re-examination eventually reject the evidence of arthropodization (sclerotization, segmentation and articulation) on the appendages as well as the fundamental relationship between \"Diania\" and arthropods.\nStem-group onychophorans.\nWhile \"Antennacanthopodia\" is widely accepted as a stem-group onychophoran, the position of other xenusiid genera that were previously thought to be onychophoran-related is controversial \u2014 in further studies, most of them were either suggested to be stem-group onychophorans or basal panarthropods, with a few species (\"Aysheaia\" or \"Onychodictyon ferox\") occasionally suggested to be stem-group tardigrades. A study in 2014 suggested that \"Hallucigenia\" are stem-group onychophorans based on their claws, which have overlapped internal structures resembling those of an extant onychophoran. This interpretation was questioned by later studies, as the structures may be a panarthropod plesiomorphy.\nStem-group tardigrades.\nLobopodian taxa of the tardigrade stem-group is unclear. \"Aysheaia\" or \"Onychodictyon ferox\" had been suggest to be a possible member, based on the high claw number (in \"Aysheaia\") and/or terminal lobopods with anterior-facing claws (in both taxa). Although not widely accepted, there are even suggestions that Tardigrada itself representing the basalmost panarthropod or branch between the arthropod stem-group. However, a paper in 2023 found luolishaniids to be the closest relatives of tardigrades using various morphological characteristics.\nStem-group panarthropods.\nIt is unclear which lobopodians represent members of the panarthropod stem-group, and which were branched just before the last common ancestor of extant panarthropod phyla. \"Aysheaia\" may have occupied this position based on its apparently basic morphology; while other studies rather suggest luolishaniid and hallucigenid, two lobopodian taxa which had been resolved as members of stem-group onychophorans as well.\nDescribed genera.\nAs of 2018, over 20 lobopodian genera have been described. The fossil materials being described as lobopodians \"Mureropodia apae\" and \"Aysheaia prolata\" are considered to be disarticulated frontal appendages of the radiodonts \"Caryosyntrips\" and \"Stanleycaris\", respectively. \"Miraluolishania\" was suggested to be synonym of \"Luolishania\" by some studies. The enigmatic \"Facivermis\" was later revealed to be a highly specialized genus of luolishaniid lobopodians. \"Palaeocampa\", formerly thought to be a fireworm, was also found as a lobopodian.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is thought that the centre of the Archaeocyatha origin is now located in East Siberia, where they are first known from the beginning of the Tommotian Age of the Cambrian, 525\u00a0million years ago (mya). In other regions of the world, they appeared much later, during the Atdabanian, and quickly diversified into over a hundred families. They became the planet's first reef-building animals and are an index fossil for the Lower Cambrian worldwide.\nPreservation.\nThe remains of Archaeocyatha are mostly preserved as carbonate structures in a limestone matrix. This means that the fossils cannot be chemically or mechanically isolated, save for some specimens that have already eroded out of their matrices, and their morphology has to be determined from thin cuts of the stone in which they were preserved.\nGeological history.\nToday, the archaeocyathan families are recognisable by small but consistent differences in their fossilised structures: Some archaeocyathans were built like nested bowls, while others were as long as 300mm. Some archaeocyaths were solitary organisms, while others formed colonies. In the beginning of the Toyonian Age around 516 mya, the archaeocyaths went into a sharp decline. Almost all species became extinct by the Middle Cambrian, with the final-known species, \"Antarcticocyathus webberi\", disappearing just prior to the end of the Cambrian period. Their rapid decline and disappearance coincided with a rapid diversification of the Demosponges. As for the earliest archaeocyathan, the Ediacaran sponge \"Arimasia\" from the Nama Group may be within the clade and specifically allied with Monocyathea; however, this is unclear.\nThe archaeocyathans became the planet's first reef-building animals and are an index fossil for the Lower Cambrian worldwide. They were important reef-builders in the early to middle Cambrian, with reefs (and indeed any accumulation of carbonates) becoming very rare after the group's extinction until the diversification of new taxa of coral reef-builders in the Ordovician.\n\"Antarcticocyathus \" was considered the only late Cambrian archaeocyath, but its reinterpretation as a lithisid sponge means that there are no archaeocyathans identified post the mid-Cambrian.\nMorphology.\nThe typical archaeocyathid resembled a hollow horn coral. Each had a conical or vase-shaped porous skeleton of calcite similar to that of a sponge. The structure appeared like a pair of perforated, nested ice cream cones. Their skeletons consisted of either a single porous wall (Monocyathida), or more commonly as two concentric porous walls, an inner and outer wall separated by a space. Inside the inner wall was a cavity (like the inside of an ice cream cup). At the base, these pleosponges were held to the substrate by a holdfast. The body presumably occupied the space between the inner and outer shells (the intervallum).\nEcology.\nFlow tank experiments suggest that archaeocyathan morphology allowed them to exploit flow gradients, either by passively pumping water through the skeleton, or, as in present-day, extant sponges, by drawing water through the pores, removing nutrients, and expelling spent water and wastes through the pores into the central space.\nThe size of the pores places a limit on the size of plankton that archaeocyaths could have consumed; different species had different sized pores, the largest large enough to conceivably consume mesozooplankton, possibly giving rise to different ecological niches within a single reef.\nAlthough archaeocyaths have commonly been thought of as stenobionts narrowly adapted to carbonate-dominated marine settings, they were also present in siliciclastic-dominated environments as well.\nDistribution.\nA 2010 study showed that the centre of the Archaeocyatha origin is located in East Siberia, where they are first known from the beginning of the Tommotian Age of the Cambrian, 525\u00a0million years ago (mya). In other regions of the world, they appeared much later, during the Atdabanian, and quickly diversified into over a hundred families.\nThe archaeocyathans inhabited coastal areas of shallow seas. Their widespread distribution over almost the entire Cambrian world, as well as the taxonomic diversity of the species, might be explained by surmising that, like true sponges, they had a planktonic larval stage that enabled their wide spread.\nTaxonomy.\nTheir phylogenetic affiliation has been subject to changing interpretations, yet the consensus is growing that the archaeocyath was indeed a kind of sponge, thus sometimes called a pleosponge. But some invertebrate paleontologists have placed them in an extinct, separate phylum, known appropriately as the Archaeocyatha. However, one cladistic analysis suggests that Archaeocyatha is a clade nested within the phylum Porifera (better known as the true sponges).\nTrue archaeocyathans coexisted with other enigmatic sponge-like animals. Radiocyatha and Cribricyatha were two diverse Cambrian classes comparable to Archaeocyatha, alongside genera such as \"Boyarinovicyathus\", \"Proarchaeocyathus\", \"Acanthinocyathus\", and \"Osadchiites\".\nThe clade Archaeocyatha have traditionally been divided into Regulares and Irregulares (Rowland, 2001):\nHowever, Okulitch (1955), who at the time regarded the archaeocyathans as outside of Porifera, divided the phylum in three classes:\nNotable fossil sites.\nThe Ajax Mine Fossil Reef in the Flinders Ranges of South Australia contains a large number of Lower Cambrian Archaeocyath fossils, exposed in limestone at ground level. The term \"Ajax limestone\" is now used worldwide, and this site has been state-heritage-listed as a place of palaeontological and geological significance. The site contains a sample of almost every species of archaeocyatha known to have existed within the Australian-Antarctic geologic province. Its diversity is much greater than any other assemblage in the province, and it also contains over 100 type species, which include over 40 type species from the Cambrian period. As of 2022[ [update]] the fossil site is also one of seven sites in the Flinders Ranges under consideration for UNESCO World Heritage status.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In the movable do solf\u00e8ge system, the tonic note is sung as \"do\". More generally, the tonic is the note upon which all other notes of a piece are hierarchically referenced. Scales are named after their tonics: for instance, the tonic of the C major scale is the note C.\nThe triad formed on the tonic note, the tonic chord, is thus the most significant chord in these styles of music. In Roman numeral analysis, the tonic chord is typically symbolized by the Roman numeral \"I\" if it is major and by \"i\" if it is minor.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In very much conventionally tonal music, harmonic analysis will reveal a broad prevalence of the primary (often triadic) harmonies: tonic, dominant, and subdominant (i.e., I and its chief auxiliaries a 5th removed), and especially the first two of these.\nThese chords may also appear as seventh chords: in major, as IM7, or in minor as i7 or rarely iM7:&lt;score sound=\"1\"&gt;\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n \\clef treble\n \\time 4/4\n \\key c \\major\n &lt;c e g b&gt;1_\\markup { \\concat { \"I\" \\raise #1 \\small \"M7\" } } \\bar \"||\"\n \\clef treble\n \\time 4/4\n \\key c \\minor\n &lt;c es g b&gt;^\\markup { \"rare\" }_\\markup { \\concat { \"i\" \\raise #1 \\small \"M7\" } } \\bar \"||\"\n&lt;/score&gt;\nThe tonic is distinguished from the root, which is the reference note of a chord, rather than that of the scale.\nImportance and function.\nIn music of the common practice period, the tonic center was the most important of all the different tone centers which a composer used in a piece of music, with most pieces beginning and ending on the tonic, usually modulating to the dominant (the fifth scale degree above the tonic, or the fourth below it) in between.\nTwo parallel keys have the same tonic. For example, in both C major and C minor, the tonic is C. However, relative keys (two different scales that share the same key signature) have different tonics. For example, C major and A minor share a key signature that features no sharps or flats, despite having different tonic pitches (C and A, respectively).\nThe term \"tonic\" may be reserved exclusively for use in tonal contexts while tonal center or pitch center may be used in post-tonal and atonal music: \"For purposes of non-tonal centric music, it might be a good idea to have the term 'tone center' refer to the more general class of which 'tonics' (or tone centers in tonal contexts) could be regarded as a subclass.\" Thus, a pitch center may function referentially or contextually in an atonal context, often acting as an axis or line of symmetry in an interval cycle. The term \"pitch centricity\" was coined by Arthur Berger in his \"Problems of Pitch Organization in Stravinsky\". According to Walter Piston, \"the idea of a unified classical tonality replaced by nonclassical (in this case nondominant) centricity in a composition is perfectly demonstrated by Debussy's \"Pr\u00e9lude \u00e0 l'apr\u00e8s-midi d'un faune\"\".\nThe tonic includes four separate activities or roles as the principal goal tone, initiating event, generator of other tones, and the stable center neutralizing the tension between dominant and subdominant.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Generally, these tiny, elusive creatures consist of a somatoderm (outer layer) of ciliated cells surrounding one or more reproductive cells.\nA 2017 study recovered Mesozoa as a monophyletic group that emerged in the Lophotrochozoa as sister of the Rouphozoa.\nSome workers previously classified Mesozoa as the sole phylum of the lonely subkingdom Agnotozoa. Cavalier-Smith argued that at least some of the mesozoans are in fact protistans, not animals.\nIn the 19th century, the Mesozoa were a wastebasket taxon for multicellular organisms which lacked the invaginating gastrula which was thought to define the Metazoa.\nEvolution.\nMesozoa were once thought to be evolutionary intermediate forms between Protozoans and Metazoans, but now they are thought to be degenerate or simplified metazoa. Their ciliated larvae are similar to the miracidium of trematodes, and their internal multiplication is similar to what happens in the sporocysts of trematodes. Mesozoan DNA has a low GC-content (40%). This amount is similar to ciliates, but ciliates tend to be binucleate. Others relate mesozoa to a group including annelids, planarians and nemerteans.\nOrthonectida have a very reduced muscular and nervous system, only consisting of a few cells, but so far no muscle cells or neurons have been found in Dicyemida.\nGroupings.\nThe two main mesozoan groups are the Dicyemida and the Orthonectida. Other groups sometimes included in the Mesozoa are the Placozoa and the Monoblastozoa.\nMonoblastozoans consist of a single description written in the 19th century of a species that has not been seen since. As such, many workers doubt that they are a real group. As described, the animal had only a single layer of tissue.\nRhombozoan mesozoans.\nRhombozoa, or dicyemid mesozoans, are found in the nephrid tracts of squid and octopuses.\nThey range from a few millimeters long with twenty to thirty cells that include anterior attachment cells and a long central reproductive cell called an axial cell. This axial cell may develop asexually into vermiform juveniles or it may produce eggs and sperm that self-fertilize to produce a ciliated infusiform larva.\nThere are three genera: \"Dicyema\", \"Pseudicyema\" and \"Dicyemennea\".\nMolecular evidence suggests that this phylum are derived from the Lophotrochozoa.\nOrthonectid mesozoans.\nOrthonectida are found in the body spaces of various marine invertebrates including tissue spaces, gonads, genitorespiratory bursae. This pathogen causes host castration of different species.\nThe best known of Orthonectida is the parasite of brittle stars. The multinucleate syncytial stage lives within tissues and spaces of the gonad but can spread into arms. It causes the destruction of starfish ovary and eggs to cause castration (the male gonads are usually unaffected). The stages of the plasmodium develop into more plasmodia by simple fragmentation; at some point, they decide to go sexual. The syncytia are dioecious (either male or female), but young syncytia can fuse to produce both male and female. The males are ciliated and smaller than the females. The females and the males leave the starfish and mate in the sea. Tailed sperm enters the female and fertilizes the numerous oocytes. Each oocyst produces a small ciliated larva which makes its way to another star.\nThe genome of one of these species \u2013 \"Intoshia linei\" \u2013 has been sequenced. The Orthonectids may be degenerate annelid worms.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Most species range in size from , reaching in extreme cases, and in diameter. Horsehair worms can be discovered in damp areas, such as watering troughs, swimming pools, streams, puddles, and cisterns. The adult worms are free-living, but the larvae are parasitic on arthropods, such as beetles, cockroaches, mantises, orthopterans, and crustaceans. About 351 freshwater species are known and a conservative estimate suggests that there may be about 2000 freshwater species worldwide. The name \"Gordian\" stems from the legendary Gordian knot. This relates to the fact that nematomorphs often coil themselves in tight balls that resemble knots.\nDescription and biology.\nNematomorphs possess an external cuticle without cilia. Internally, they have only longitudinal muscle and a non-functional gut, with no excretory, respiratory or circulatory systems. The nervous system consists of a nerve ring near the anterior end of the animal and a ventral nerve cord running along the body.\nReproductively, they have two distinct sexes, with the internal fertilization of eggs that are then laid in gelatinous strings. Adults have cylindrical gonads, opening into the cloaca. The larvae have rings of cuticular hooks and terminal stylets that are believed to be used to enter the hosts. Once inside the host, the larvae live inside the haemocoel and absorb nutrients directly through their skin. Development into the adult form takes weeks or months, and the larva moults several times as it grows in size.\nThe adults are mostly free-living in freshwater or marine environments, and males and females aggregate into tight balls (\"Gordian knots\") during mating.\nIn \"Spinochordodes tellinii\" and \"Paragordius tricuspidatus\", which have grasshoppers and crickets as their hosts, the infection acts on the infected host's brain. This causes the host insect to seek water and drown itself, thus returning the nematomorph to water. \"P. tricuspidatus\" is also remarkably able to survive the predation of their host, being able to wiggle out of the predator that has eaten the host. The nematomorpha parasite affects host \"Hierodula patellifera\"'s light-interpreting organs so the host is attracted to horizontally polarized light. Thus the host goes into water and the parasite's lifecycle completes. Many of the genes the parasites use for manipulating their host have been acquired through horizontal gene transfer from the host genome.\nThere are a few cases of accidental parasitism in vertebrate hosts, including dogs, cats, and humans. Several cases involving \"Parachordodes\", \"Paragordius\", or \"Gordius\" have been recorded in human hosts in Japan and China.\nCommunity ecology.\nOwing to their use of orthopterans as hosts, nematomorphs can be significant factors in shaping community ecology. One study conducted in a Japanese riparian ecosystem showed that nematomorphs could cause orthopterans to become 20 times more likely to enter water than uninfected orthopterans; these orthopterans constituted up to 60% of the annual energy intake for the Kirikuchi char. The absence of nematomorphs from riparian communities can thus lead to char preying more heavily on other aquatic invertebrates, potentially causing more widespread physiological effects.\nTaxonomy.\nNematomorphs can be confused with nematodes, particularly mermithid worms. Unlike nematomorphs, mermithids do not have a terminal cloaca. Male mermithids have one or two spicules just before the end, apart from having a thinner, smoother cuticle without areoles and paler brown colour.\nThe phylum is placed along with the Ecdysozoa clade of moulting organisms that include the Arthropoda. Their closest relatives are the nematodes. The two phyla make up the group Nematoida in the clade Cycloneuralia. During the larval stage, the animals show a resemblance to adult kinorhyncha and some species of Loricifera and Priapulida, all members of the group Scalidophora. The earliest Nematomorph could be \"Maotianshania\", from the Lower Cambrian; this organism is, however, very different from extant species; fossilized worms resembling the modern forms have been reported from mid Cretaceous Burmese amber dated to 100 million years ago.\nRelationships within the phylum are still somewhat unclear, but two classes are recognised. The five marine species of nematomorph are contained in Nectonematoida. This order is monotypic containing the genus \"Nectonema\" : adults are planktonic and the larvae parasitise decapod crustaceans, especially crabs. They are characterized by a double row of natotory setae along each side of the body, dorsal and ventral longitudinal epidermal cords, a spacious and fluid-filled blastocoelom and singular gonads.\nThe approximately 320 remaining species are distributed between two families, within the monotypic class Gordioida. Gordioidean adults are free-living in freshwater or semiterrestrial habitats and larvae parasitise insects, primarily orthopterans. Unlike nectonematiodeans, gordioideans lack lateral rows of setae, have a single, ventral epidermal cord and their blastocoels are filled with mesenchyme in young animals but become spacious in older individuals.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In appearance they have variously been compared to worms with legs, caterpillars, and slugs. They prey upon other invertebrates, which they catch by ejecting an adhesive slime. Approximately 200\u00a0species of velvet worms have been described, although the true number is likely to be much greater.\nThe two extant families of velvet worms are Peripatidae and Peripatopsidae. They show a peculiar distribution, with the peripatids being predominantly equatorial and tropical, while the peripatopsids are all found south of the equator. It is the only phylum within Animalia that is wholly endemic to terrestrial environments, at least among extant members. Velvet worms are generally considered close relatives of the Arthropoda and Tardigrada, with which they form the proposed taxon Panarthropoda. This makes them of palaeontological interest, as they can help reconstruct the ancestral arthropod. Only two fossil species are confidently assigned as onychophorans: \"Antennipatus\" from the Late Carboniferous, and \"Cretoperipatus\" from the Late Cretaceous, the latter belonging to Peripatidae. In modern zoology, they are known for their mating behaviours and for some species bearing live young.\nAnatomy and physiology.\nVelvet worms are segmented animals with a flattened cylindrical body cross-section and rows of unstructured body appendages known as \"oncopods\" or \"lobopods\" (\"stub feet\"). They reach lengths between depending on species, with the smallest known being \"Ooperipatellus nanus\" and the largest known \"Mongeperipatus solorzanoi\". The number of leg pairs ranges from as few as 13 (in \"Ooperipatellus nanus\") to as many as 43 (in \"Plicatoperipatus jamaicensis\"). Their skin consists of numerous, fine transverse rings and is often inconspicuously coloured orange, red or brown, but sometimes also bright green, blue, gold or white, and occasionally patterned with other colours. Segmentation is outwardly inconspicuous, and identifiable by the regular spacing of the pairs of legs and in the regular arrangement of skin pores, excretion organs and concentrations of nerve cells. The individual body sections are largely unspecialised; even the head develops only a little differently from the abdominal segments. Segmentation is apparently specified by the same gene as in other groups of animals, and is activated in each case, during embryonic development, at the rear border of each segment and in the growth zone of the stub feet. Although onychophorans fall within the protostome group, their early development has a deuterostome trajectory (with the mouth and anus forming separately); this trajectory is concealed by the rather sophisticated processes which occur in early development.\nAntennae.\nOn the first head segment is a pair of slender antennae, which serve in sensory perception. They probably do not correspond directly to the antennae of the Arthropoda, but perhaps rather with their \"lips\" or labrum. At their base is a pair of simple eyes, except in a few blind species. In front of these, in many Australian species, are various dimples, whose function is not yet clear. It appears that in at least some species, these serve in the transfer of sperm-cell packages (spermatophores).\nMouth and jaws.\nOn the belly side of the second head segment is the labrum, a mouth opening surrounded by sensitive \"lips\". In the velvet worms, this structure is a muscular outgrowth of the throat, so, despite its name, it is probably not homologous to the labrum of the Arthropoda and is used for feeding. Deep within the oral cavity lie the sharp, crescent-shaped \"jaws\", or mandibles, which are strongly hardened and resemble the claws of the feet, with which they are serially homologous; early in development, the jaw appendages have a position and shape similar to the subsequent legs. The jaws are divided into internal and external mandibles and their concave surface bears fine denticles. They move backward and forward in a longitudinal direction, tearing apart the prey, apparently moved in one direction by musculature and the other by hydrostatic pressure. The claws are made of sclerotised \u03b1-chitin, reinforced with phenols and quinones, and have a uniform composition, except that there is a higher concentration of calcium towards the tip, presumably affording greater strength.\nThe surface of the mandibles is smooth, with no ornamentation. The cuticle in the mandibles (and claws) is distinct from the rest of the body. It has an inner and outer component; the outer component has just two layers (whereas body cuticle has four), and these outer layers (in particular the inner epicuticle) are dehydrated and strongly tanned, affording toughness.\nSlime papillae.\nOn the third head segment, to the left and right of the mouth, are two openings called \"oral papillae\", with each containing a large, heavily branched slime gland. These slime glands lie roughly in the center of a velvet worm's body and secrete a sort of milky-white slime. The slime is used to both ensnare prey and act as a distraction for defensive purposes. In certain species, an organ connected to the slime gland known as the \"slime conductor\" is broadened into a reservoir, allowing it to hold pre-produced slime.\nVelvet worm slime glands and oral papilla are likely modified and repurposed limbs. The glands themselves are probably modified crural glands. All three structures correspond to an evolutionary origin in the leg pairs of the other segments.\nSlime.\nThe Onychophora forcefully squirt glue-like slime from their oral papillae; they do so either in defense against predators or to capture prey. The openings of the glands that produce the slime are in the papillae, a pair of highly modified limbs on the sides of the head below the antennae. Inside, they have a syringe-like system that, by a geometric amplifier, allows for fast squirt using slow muscular contraction. High speed films show the animal expelling two streams of adhesive liquid through a small opening (50\u2013200 microns) at a speed of . The interplay between the elasticity of oral papillae and the fast unsteady flow produces a passive oscillatory motion (30\u201360\u00a0Hz) of the oral papillae. The oscillation causes the streams to cross in mid air, weaving a disordered net; the velvet worms can control only the general direction where the net is thrown.\nThe slime glands themselves are deep inside the body cavity, each at the end of a tube more than half the length of the body. The tube both conducts the fluid and stores it until it is required. The distance that the animal can propel the slime varies; usually it squirts it about a centimetre, but the maximal range has variously been reported to be ten centimetres, or even nearly a foot, although accuracy drops with range. It is not clear to what extent the range varies with the species and other factors. One squirt usually suffices to snare a prey item, although larger prey may be further immobilised by smaller squirts targeted at the limbs; additionally, the fangs of spiders are sometimes targeted. Upon ejection, it forms a net of threads about twenty microns in diameter, with evenly spaced droplets of viscous adhesive fluid along their length. It subsequently dries, shrinking, losing its stickiness, and becoming brittle. Onychophora eat their dried slime when they can, which seems provident, since an onychophoran requires about 24\u00a0days to replenish an exhausted slime repository.\nThe slime can account for up to 11% of the organism's dry weight and is 90% water; its dry residue consists mainly of proteins\u2014primarily a collagen-type protein. 1.3% of the slime's dry weight consists of sugars, mainly galactosamine. The slime also contains lipids and the surfactant nonylphenol. Onychophora are the only organisms known to produce this latter substance. It tastes \"slightly bitter and at the same time somewhat astringent\". The proteinaceous composition accounts for the slime's high tensile strength and stretchiness. The lipid and nonylphenol constituents may serve one of two purposes: They may line the ejection channel, stopping the slime from sticking to the organism when it is secreted; or they may slow the drying process long enough for the slime to reach its target.\nLobopods.\nThe stub feet that characterise the velvet worms are conical, baggy appendages of the body, which are internally hollow and have no joints. Although the number of feet can vary considerably between species, their structure is basically very similar. Rigidity is provided by the hydrostatic pressure of their fluid contents, and movement is usually obtained passively by stretching and contraction of the animal's entire body. However, each leg can also be shortened and bent by internal muscles. Due to the lack of joints, this bending can take place at any point along the sides of the leg. In some species, two different organs are found within the feet:\nOn each foot is a pair of retractable, hardened (sclerotised) chitin claws, which give the taxon its scientific name: Onychophora is derived from the , , \"claws\"; and , , \"to carry\". At the base of the claws are three to six spiny \"cushions\" on which the leg sits in its resting position and on which the animal walks over smooth substrates. The claws are used mainly to gain a firm foothold on uneven terrain. Each claw is composed of three stacked elements, like Russian nesting dolls. The outermost is shed during ecdysis, which exposes the next element, which is fully formed and so does not need time to harden before it is used.&lt;ref name=\"doi10.1038/nature13576\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This distinctive construction identifies many early Cambrian fossils as early offshoots of the onychophoran lineage. \nNervous system.\nThe entire body, including the stub feet, is littered with numerous papillae: warty protrusions responsive to touch that carry a mechanoreceptive bristle at the tip, each of which is also connected to further sensory nerve cells lying beneath. The mouth papillae, the exits of the slime glands, probably also have some function in sensory perception. Sensory cells known as \"sensills\" on the \"lips\" or labrum respond to chemical stimuli and are known as chemoreceptors. These are also found on the two antennae, which seem to be the velvet worm's most important sensory organs.\nExcept in a few (typically subterranean) species, one simply constructed eye (ocellus) lies behind each antenna, laterally, just underneath the head. This consists of a chitinous ball lens, a cornea and a retina and is connected to the centre of the brain via an optic nerve. The retina comprises numerous pigment cells and photoreceptors; the latter are easily modified flagellated cells, whose flagellum membranes carry a photosensitive pigment on their surface.\nThe rhabdomeric eyes of the Onychophora are thought to be homologous with the median ocelli of arthropods; this would suggest that the last common ancestor of arthropods may have only had median ocelli.\nHowever, the innervation shows that the homology is limited: The eyes of Onychophora form behind the antenna, whereas the opposite is true in arthropods.\nSkin and muscle.\nUnlike the arthropods, velvet worms do not possess a rigid exoskeleton. Instead, their fluid-filled body cavity acts as a hydrostatic skeleton, similarly to many distantly related soft-bodied animals that are cylindrically shaped, for example sea anemones and various worms. Pressure of their (near-incompressible) internal bodily fluid on the body wall provides rigidity, and muscles are able to act against it. The body wall consists of a non-cellular outer skin, the cuticula; a single layer of epidermis cells forming an internal skin; and beneath this, usually three layers of muscle, which are embedded in connective tissues. The cuticula is about a micrometer thick and covered with fine villi. In composition and structure, it resembles the cuticula of the arthropods, consisting of \u03b1-chitin and various proteins, although not containing collagen. It can be divided into an external epicuticula and an internal procuticula, which themselves consist of exo- and endo-cuticula. This multi-level structure is responsible for the high flexibility of the outer skin, which enables the velvet worm to squeeze itself into the narrowest crevices. Although outwardly water-repellent, the cuticula is not able to prevent water loss by respiration, and, as a result, velvet worms can live only in microclimates with high humidity to avoid desiccation. The surface of the cuticula is scattered with numerous fine papilla, the larger of which carry visible villi-like sensitive bristles. The papillae themselves are covered with tiny scales, lending the skin a velvety appearance (from which the common name is likely derived). It also feels like dry velvet to the touch, for which its water-repellent nature is responsible. Moulting of the skin (ecdysis) takes place regularly, around every 14 days, induced by the hormone ecdysone. The inner surface of the skin bears a hexagonal pattern. At each moult, the shed skin is replaced by the epidermis, which lies immediately beneath it; unlike the cuticula, this consists of living cells. Beneath this lies a thick layer of connective tissue, which is composed primarily of collagen fibres aligned either parallel or perpendicular to the body's longitudinal axis. The colouration of Onychophora is generated by a range of pigments. The solubility of these pigments is a useful diagnostic character: in all arthropods and tardigrades, the body pigment is soluble in ethanol. This is also true for the Peripatidae, but in the case of the Peripatopsidae, the body pigment is insoluble in ethanol.\nWithin the connective tissue lie three continuous layers of unspecialised smooth muscular tissue. The relatively thick outer layer is composed of annular muscles, and the similarly voluminous inner layer of longitudinal muscles. Between them lie thin diagonal muscles that wind backward and forward along the body axis in a spiral. Between the annular and diagonal muscles exist fine blood vessels, which lie below the superficially recognisable transverse rings of the skin and are responsible for the pseudo-segmented markings. Beneath the internal muscle layer lies the body cavity. In cross-section, this is divided into three regions by so-called dorso-ventral muscles, which run from the middle of the underbelly through to the edges of the upper side: a central midsection and on the left and right, two side regions that also include the legs.\nCirculation.\nThe body cavity is known as a \"pseudocoel\", or haemocoel. Unlike a true coelom, a pseudocoel is not fully enclosed by a cell layer derived from the embryonic mesoderm. A coelom is, however, formed around the gonads and the waste-eliminating nephridia. As the name \"haemocoel\" suggests, the body cavity is filled with a blood-like liquid in which all the organs are embedded; in this way, they can be easily supplied with nutrients circulating in the blood. This liquid is colourless as it does not contain pigments; for this reason, it serves only a limited role in oxygen transport.\nTwo different types of blood cells (or haemocytes) circulate in the fluid: Amoebocytes and nephrocytes. The amoebocytes probably function in protection from bacteria and other foreign bodies; in some species, they also play a role in reproduction. Nephrocytes absorb toxins or convert them into a form suitable for elimination by the nephridia.\nThe haemocoel is divided by a horizontal partition, the diaphragm, into two parts: The pericardial sinus along the back and the perivisceral sinus along the belly. The former encloses the tube-like heart, and the latter, the other organs. The diaphragm is perforated in many places, enabling the exchange of fluids between the two cavities. The heart itself is a tube of annular muscles consisting of epithelial tissues, with two lateral openings (ostia) per segment. While it is not known whether the rear end is open or closed, from the front, it opens directly into the body cavity.\nSince there are no blood vessels, apart from the fine vessels running between the muscle layers of the body wall and a pair of arteries that supply the antennae, this is referred to as an open circulation. The timing of the pumping procedure can be divided into two parts: Diastole and systole. During diastole, blood flows through the ostia from the pericardial sinus (the cavity containing the heart) into the heart. When the systole begins, the ostia close and the heart muscles contract inwards, reducing the volume of the heart. This pumps the blood from the front end of the heart into the perivisceral sinus containing the organs. In this way, the various organs are supplied with nutrients before the blood finally returns to the pericardial sinus via the perforations in the diaphragm. In addition to the pumping action of the heart, body movements also influence circulation.\nRespiration.\nOxygen uptake occurs to an extent via simple diffusion through the entire body surface, with the coxal vesicles on the legs possibly being involved in some species. However, of most importance is gas exchange via fine unbranched tubes, the tracheae, which draw oxygen from the surface deep into the various organs, particularly the heart.\nThe walls of these structures, which are less than three micrometers thick in their entirety, consist only of an extremely thin membrane through which oxygen can easily diffuse. The tracheae originate at tiny openings, the spiracles, which themselves are clustered together in dent-like recesses of the outer skin, the atria. The number of \"tracheae bundles\" thus formed is on average around 75\u00a0bundles per body segment; they accumulate most densely on the back of the organism.\nUnlike the arthropods, the velvet worms are unable to control the openings of their tracheae; the tracheae are always open, entailing considerable water loss in arid conditions. Water is lost twice as fast as in earthworms and forty times faster than in caterpillars. For this reason, velvet worms are dependent upon habitats with high air humidity.\nOxygen transport is helped by the oxygen carrier hemocyanin.\nDigestion and excretion.\nThe digestive tract begins slightly behind the head, the mouth lying on the underside a little way from the frontmost point of the body. Here, prey can be mechanically dismembered by the mandibles with their covering of fine toothlets. Two salivary glands discharge via a common conductor into the subsequent \"throat\", which makes up the first part of the front intestine. The saliva that they produce contains mucus and hydrolytic enzymes, which initiate digestion in and outside the mouth.\nThe throat itself is very muscular, serving to absorb the partially liquified food and to pump it, via the oesophagus, which forms the rear part of the front intestine, into the central intestine. Unlike the front intestine, this is not lined with a cuticula but instead consists only of a single layer of epithelial tissue, which does not exhibit conspicuous indentation as is found in other animals.\nOn entering the central intestine, food particles are coated with a mucus-based peritrophic membrane, which serves to protect the lining of the intestine from damage by sharp-edged particles. The intestinal epithelium secretes further digestive enzymes and absorbs the released nutrients, although the majority of digestion has already taken place externally or in the mouth. Indigestible remnants arrive in the rear intestine, or rectum, which is once again lined with a cuticula and which opens at the anus, located on the underside near to the rear end.\nIn almost every segment is a pair of excretory organs called nephridia, which are derived from coelom tissue. Each consists of a small pouch that is connected, via a flagellated conductor called a nephridioduct, to an opening at the base of the nearest leg known as a nephridiopore. The pouch is occupied by special cells called podocytes, which facilitate ultrafiltration of the blood through the partition between haemocoelom and nephridium.\nThe composition of the urinary solution is modified in the nephridioduct by selective recovery of nutrients and water and by isolation of poison and waste materials, before it is excreted to the outside world via the nephridiopore. The most important nitrogenous excretion product is the water-insoluble uric acid; this can be excreted in solid state, with very little water. This so-called uricotelic excretory mode represents an adjustment to life on land and the associated necessity of dealing economically with water.\nA pair of former nephridia in the head were converted secondarily into the salivary glands, while another pair in the final segment of male specimens now serve as glands that apparently play a role in reproduction.\nReproductive organs.\nBoth sexes possess pairs of gonads, opening via a channel called a gonoduct into a common genital opening, the gonopore, which is located on the rear ventral side. Both the gonads and the gonoduct are derived from true coelom tissue.\nIn females, the two ovaries are joined in the middle and to the horizontal diaphragm. The gonoduct appears differently depending on whether the species is live-bearing or egg-laying. In live-bearing species, each exit channel divides into a slender oviduct and a roomy \"womb\", the uterus, in which the embryos develop. The single vagina, to which both uteri are connected, runs outward to the gonopore. In egg-laying species, whose gonoduct is uniformly constructed, the genital opening lies at the tip of a long egg-laying apparatus, the ovipositor. The females of many species also possess a sperm repository called the \"receptacle seminis\", in which sperm cells from males can be stored temporarily or for longer periods.\nMales possess two separate testes, along with the corresponding sperm vesicle (the vesicula seminalis) and exit channel (the vasa efferentia). The two vasa efferentia unite to a common sperm duct, the vas deferens, which in turn widens through the ejaculatory channel to open at the gonopore. Directly beside or behind this lie two pairs of special glands, which probably serve some auxiliary reproductive function; the rearmost glands are also known as anal glands. A penis-like structure has so far been found only in males of the genus \"Paraperipatus\" but has not yet been observed in action.\nThere are different mating procedures: in some species males deposit their spermatophore directly into the female's genital opening, while others deposit it on the female's body, where the cuticle will collapse, allowing the sperm cells to migrate into the female. There are also Australian species where the male place their spermatophore on top of their head, which is then pressed against the female's genitals. In these species the head have elaborate structures like spikes, spines, hollow stylets, pits, and depressions, whose purpose is to either hold the sperm and / or assist in the sperm transfer to the female. The males of most species also secrete a pheromone from glands on the underside of the legs to attract females.\nDistribution and habitat.\nDistribution.\nVelvet worms are found in the tropics and in the temperate zone of the Southern Hemisphere. Members of the family Peripatidae are found the tropical regions of South America, Central America, the Caribbean islands, Gabon, Northeast India, and Southeast Asia. Meanwhile, members of Peripatopsidae are found Chile, Australia, Southern Africa, New Guinea, and New Zealand. One deviation is the South African \"Peripatopsis capensis\". This animal was inadvertently introduced to Santa Cruz Island in the Galapagos and co-occurs with native species. When looking at velvet worms as a whole, the majority of are found in Australia and South America.\nExtinct onychophorans have been discovered in parts of the Northern Hemisphere which are currently uninhabited by the group. While the onychophoran affinities of \"Succinipatopsis\" and \"Helenodora\" of are questioned,\"\" others like the \"Antennipatus\" are at a minimum close relatives of crown-group Onychophora (Peripatidae and Peripatopsidae). This indicates that velvet worms were far more widespread in the past, but subsequently died off for unknown reasons.\nHabitat.\nVelvet worms always sparsely occupy the habitats where they are found: they are rare among the fauna of which they are a part.\nAll extant velvet worms are terrestrial (land-living) and prefer dark environments with high air humidity. They are found particularly in the rainforests of the tropics and temperate zones, where they live among moss cushions and leaf litter, under tree trunks and stones, in rotting wood or in termite tunnels. They also occur in unforested grassland, if there exist sufficient crevices in the soil into which they can withdraw during the day, and in caves. Two species live in caves, a habitat to which their ability to squeeze themselves into the smallest cracks makes them exceptionally well-adapted and in which constant living conditions are guaranteed. Since the essential requirements for cave life were probably already present prior to the settlement of these habitats, this may be described as exaptation.\nSome species of velvet worms are able to occupy human-modified land-uses, such as cocoa and banana plantations in South America and the Caribbean, but for others, conversion of rainforests is likely one of the most important threats to their survival (see Conservation).\nVelvet worms are photophobic: They are repelled by bright light sources. Because the danger of desiccation is greatest during the day and in dry weather, it is not surprising that velvet worms are usually most active at night and during rainy weather. Under cold or dry conditions, they actively seek out crevices in which they shift their body into a resting state.\nBehaviour.\nLocomotion.\nVelvet worms move in a slow and gradual motion that makes them difficult for prey to notice. Their trunk is raised relatively high above the ground, and they walk with non-overlapping steps.\nTo move from place to place, the velvet worm crawls forward using its legs; unlike in arthropods, both legs of a pair are moved simultaneously. The claws of the feet are used only on hard, rough terrain where a firm grip is needed; on soft substrates, such as moss, the velvet worm walks on the foot cushions at the base of the claws.\nActual locomotion is achieved less by the exertion of the leg muscles than by local changes of body length. This can be controlled using the annular and longitudinal muscles. If the annular muscles are contracted, the body cross-section is reduced, and the corresponding segment lengthens; this is the usual mode of operation of the hydrostatic skeleton as also employed by other worms. Due to the stretching, the legs of the segment concerned are lifted and swung forward. Local contraction of the longitudinal muscles then shortens the appropriate segment, and the legs, which are now in contact with the ground, are moved to the rear. This part of the locomotive cycle is the actual leg stroke that is responsible for forward movement. The individual stretches and contractions of the segments are coordinated by the nervous system such that contraction waves run the length of the body, each pair of legs swinging forward and then down and rearward in succession. \"Macroperipatus\" can reach speeds of up to four centimetres per second, although speeds of around 6\u00a0body-lengths per minute are more typical.&lt;ref name=\"doi10.1111/j.1096-3642.1950.tb01699.x\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The body gets longer and narrower as the animal picks up speed; the length of each leg also varies during each stride.\nSociality.\nThe brains of Onychophora, though small, are very complex; consequently, the organisms are capable of rather sophisticated social interactions. Behaviour may vary from genus to genus, so this article reflects the most-studied genus, \"Euperipatoides\".\nThe \"Euperipatoides\" form social groups of up to fifteen individuals, usually closely related, which will typically live and hunt together. Groups usually live together; in drier regions an example of a shared home would be the moist interior of a rotting log. Group members are extremely aggressive towards individuals from other logs. Dominance is achieved through aggression and maintained through submissive behaviour. After a kill, the dominant female always feeds first, followed in turn by the other females, then males, then the young.\nWhen assessing other individuals, individuals often measure one another up by running their antennae down the length of the other individual. Once hierarchy has been established, pairs of individuals will often cluster together to form an \"aggregate\"; this is fastest in male-female pairings, followed by pairs of females, then pairs of males.\nSocial hierarchy is established by a number of interactions: Higher-ranking individuals will chase and bite their subordinates while the latter are trying to crawl on top of them. Juveniles never engage in aggressive behaviour, but climb on top of adults, which tolerate their presence on their backs.\nHierarchy is quickly established among individuals from a single group, but not among organisms from different groups; these are substantially more aggressive and very rarely climb one another or form aggregates. Individuals within an individual log are usually closely related; especially so with males. This may be related to the intense aggression between unrelated females.\nFeeding.\nVelvet worms are ambush predators, hunting only by night, and are able to capture animals at least their own size, although capturing a large prey item may take almost all of their mucus-secreting capacity. They feed on almost any small invertebrates, including woodlice (Isopoda), termites (Isoptera), crickets (Gryllidae), book/bark lice (Psocoptera), cockroaches (Blattidae), millipedes and centipedes (Myriapoda), spiders (Araneae), various worms, and even large snails (Gastropoda). Depending on their size, they eat on average every one to four weeks. They are considered to be ecologically equivalent to centipedes (Chilopoda).\nThe most energetically favourable prey are two-fifths the size of the hunting onychophoran. Ninety percent of the time involved in eating prey is spent ingesting it; re-ingestion of the slime used to trap the insect is performed while the onychophoran locates a suitable place to puncture the prey, and this phase accounts for around 8% of the feeding time, with the remaining time evenly split between examining, squirting, and injecting the prey. In some cases, chunks of the prey item are bitten off and swallowed; indigestible components take around 18 hours to pass through the digestive tract.\nOnychophora probably do not primarily use vision to detect their prey; although their tiny eyes do have a good image-forming capacity, their forward vision is obscured by their antennae; their nocturnal habit also limits the utility of eyesight. Air currents, formed by prey motion, are thought to be the primary mode of locating prey; the role of scent, if any, is unclear. Because it takes so long to ingest a prey item, hunting mainly happens around dusk; the onychophorans will abandon their prey at sunrise. This predatory way of life is probably a consequence of the velvet worm's need to remain moist: Due to the continual risk of desiccation, often only a few hours per day are available for finding food. This leads to a strong selection for a low cost-benefit ratio, which cannot be achieved with a herbivorous diet.\nVelvet worms literally creep up on their prey, with their smooth, gradual and fluid movement escaping detection. Once they reach their prey, they touch it very softly with their antennae to assess its size and nutritional value. After each poke, the antenna is hastily retracted to avoid alerting the prey. This investigation may last anywhere upwards of ten seconds, until the velvet worm makes a decision as to whether to attack it, or until it disturbs the prey and the prey flees. Hungry Onychophora spend less time investigating their prey and are quicker to apply their slime. Once slime has been squirted, Onychophora are determined to pursue and devour their prey, in order to recoup the energy investment. They have been observed to spend up to ten minutes searching for removed prey, after which they return to their slime to eat it. In the case of smaller prey, they may opt not to use slime at all. Subsequently, a soft part of the prey item (usually a joint membrane in arthropod prey) is identified, punctured with a bite from the jaws, and injected with saliva. This kills the prey very quickly and begins a slower process of digestion. While the onychophoran waits for the prey to digest, it salivates on its slime and begins to eat it (and anything attached to it). It subsequently tugs and slices at the earlier perforation to allow access to the now-liquefied interior of its prey. The jaws operate by moving backwards and forwards along the axis of the body (not in a side-to-side clipping motion as in arthropods), conceivably using a pairing of musculature and hydrostatic pressure. The pharynx is specially adapted for sucking, to extract the liquefied tissue; the arrangement of the jaws about the tongue and lip papillae ensures a tight seal and the establishment of suction. In social groups, the dominant female is the first to feed, not permitting competitors access to the prey item for the first hour of feeding. Subsequently, subordinate individuals begin to feed. The number of males reaches a peak after females start to leave the prey item. After feeding, individuals clean their antennae and mouth parts before re-joining the rest of their group.\nGrowth, development, and reproduction.\nAlmost all velvet worms reproduce sexually. The sole exception is \"Epiperipatus imthurni\", which have no males and reproduce by parthenogenesis. In most cases, velvet worms are sexually dimorphic. Females are usually larger than males and can often have more legs. All velvet worms have internal fertilization, though the way this is done varies widely. For most of them, a package of sperm cells called the spermatophore is placed into female's vagina. In many species, fertilization happens only once. Because of this, copulation can happen before reproductive organs are even fully developed. In cases like this, sperm cells are kept in a special reservoir where they can survive for longer.\nThe detailed process by which this is achieved is in most cases still unknown, a true penis having been observed only in species of the genus \"Paraperipatus\". In many Australian species, there exist dimples or special dagger- or axe-shaped structures on the head; the male of \"Florelliceps stutchburyae\" presses a long spine against the female's genital opening and probably positions its spermatophore there in this way. During the process, the female supports the male by keeping him clasped with the claws of her last pair of legs. The mating behavior of two species of the genus \"Peripatopsis\" is particularly curious. Here, the male places two-millimetre spermatophores on the back or sides of the female. Amoebocytes from the female's blood collect on the inside of the deposition site, and both the spermatophore's casing and the body wall on which it rests are decomposed via the secretion of enzymes. This releases the sperm cells, which then move freely through the haemocoel, penetrate the external wall of the ovaries and finally fertilize the ova. Why this self-inflicted skin injury does not lead to bacterial infections is not yet understood (though likely related to the enzymes used to deteriorate the skin or facilitate the transfer of viable genetic material from male to female). Velvet worms are found in egg-laying (oviparous), egg-live-bearing (ovoviviparous) and live-bearing (viviparous) forms.\nIn a recent peer-reviewed paper published in the \"Journal of Zoology,\" researchers discovered that certain species of Peripatus exhibit a unique form of parental care. Unlike most invertebrates, where parental involvement is minimal, female Peripatus were observed actively guarding their eggs and even providing protection to their offspring after hatching. This finding challenges the conventional understanding of reproductive behavior in invertebrates and highlights the diversity of parenting strategies in the animal kingdom.\nA female can have between 1 and 23 offspring per year; development from fertilized ovum to adult takes between 6 and 17\u00a0months and does not have a larval stage. This is probably also the original mode of development. Velvet worms have been known to live for up to six years.\nEcology.\nThe velvet worm's important predators are primarily various spiders and centipedes, along with rodents and birds, such as, in Central America, the clay-coloured thrush (\"Turdus grayi\"). In South America, Hemprichi's coral snake (\"Micrurus hemprichii\") feeds almost exclusively on velvet worms. For defence, some species roll themselves reflexively into a spiral, while they can also fight off smaller opponents by ejecting slime. Various mites (Acari) are known to be ectoparasites infesting the skin of the velvet worm. Skin injuries are usually accompanied by bacterial infections, which are almost always fatal.\nPhylogeny.\nInternal phylogeny.\nLiving velvet worms are divided into two families: Peripatidae and Peripatopsidae. These diverged around 274 million years ago during the Late Devonian and have since diversified. Within Peripatidae, the genera Eoperipatus (found in Southeast Asia) and Mesoperipatus (found in Gabon) were the most basal, while the rest of the group is found in tropical regions of the Americas. On the other hand, Peritpatopsidae can be divided into two main clades. One has members in Southern Africa and Chile, while the others live in Australasia.\nBelow is a genus-level cladogram of velvet worms. Note that this phylogeny doesn't analyze every species and lumps most peripatids into Neopatida, as many Peripatidae genera are paraphyletic. As of 2023, there are around 232 total living species, meaning this phylogeny should eventually be updated.\nExternal phylogeny.\nIn their present forms, the velvet worms are probably very closely related to the arthropods, a very extensive taxon that incorporates, for instance, the crustaceans, insects, and arachnids. They share, among other things, an exoskeleton consisting of \u03b1-chitin and non-collagenous proteins; gonads and waste-elimination organs enclosed in true coelom tissue; an open blood system with a tubular heart situated at the rear; an abdominal cavity divided into pericardial and perivisceral cavities; respiration via tracheae; and similar embryonic development. Segmentation, with two body appendages per segment, is also a shared feature.\nHowever, the antennae, mandibles, and oral papillae of velvet worms are probably \"not\" homologous to the corresponding features in arthropods; i.e., they probably developed independently.\nAnother closely related group are the comparatively obscure water bears (Tardigrada); however, due to their very small size, water bears have no need for\u2014and hence lack\u2014blood circulation and separate respiratory structures: shared characteristics that support common ancestry of velvet worms and arthropods.\nTogether, the velvet worms, arthropods, and water bears form a monophyletic taxon, the Panarthropoda, i.e., the three groups collectively cover all descendants of their last common ancestor. Due to certain similarities of form, the velvet worms were usually grouped with the water bears to form the taxon Protoarthropoda. This designation would imply that both velvet worms and water bears are not yet as highly developed as the arthropods. Modern systematic theories reject such conceptions of \"primitive\" and \"highly developed\" organisms and instead consider exclusively the historical relationships among the taxa. These relationships are not as yet fully understood, but it is considered probable that the velvet worms' sister groups form a taxon designated Tactopoda, thus:\nFor a long time, velvet worms were also considered related to the annelids. They share, among other things, a worm-like body; a thin and flexible outer skin; a layered musculature; paired waste-elimination organs; as well as a simply constructed brain and simple eyes. Decisive, however, was the existence of segmentation in both groups, with the segments showing only minor specialisation. The parapodia appendages found in annelids therefore correspond to the stump feet of the velvet worms. Within the Articulata hypothesis developed by Georges Cuvier, the velvet worms therefore formed an evolutionary link between the annelids and the arthropods: worm-like precursors first developed parapodia, which then developed further into stub feet as an intermediate link in the ultimate development of the arthropods' appendages. Due to their structural conservatism, the velvet worms were thus considered \"living fossils\". This perspective was expressed paradigmatically in the statement by the French zoologist A. Vandel:\n\"Onychophorans can be considered highly evolved annelids, adapted to terrestrial life, which announced prophetically the Arthropoda. They are a lateral branch which has endured from ancient times until today, without important modifications.\"\nModern taxonomy does not study criteria such as \"higher\" and \"lower\" states of development or distinctions between \"main\" and \"side\" branches\u2014only family relationships indicated by cladistic methods are considered relevant. From this point of view, several common characteristics still support the Articulata hypothesis \u2014 segmented body; paired appendages on each segment; pairwise arrangement of waste-elimination organs in each segment; and above all, a rope-ladder-like nervous system based on a double nerve strand lying along the belly. An alternative concept, most widely accepted today, is the so-called Ecdysozoa hypothesis. This places the annelids and Panarthropoda in two very different groups: the former in the Lophotrochozoa and the latter in the Ecdysozoa. Mitochondrial gene sequences also provide support for this hypothesis. Proponents of this hypothesis assume that the aforementioned similarities between annelids and velvet worms either developed convergently or were primitive characteristics passed unchanged from a common ancestor to both the Lophotrochozoa and Ecdysozoa. For example, in the first case, the rope-ladder nervous system would have developed in the two groups independently, while in the second case, it is a very old characteristic, which does not imply a particularly close relationship between the annelids and Panarthropoda. The Ecdysozoa concept divides the taxon into two, the Panarthropoda into which the velvet worms are placed, and the sister group Cycloneuralia, containing the threadworms (Nematoda), horsehair worms (Nematomorpha) and three rather obscure groups: the mud dragons (Kinorhyncha); penis worms (Priapulida); and brush-heads (Loricifera).\nParticularly characteristic of the Cycloneuralia is a ring of \"circumoral\" nerves around the mouth opening, which the proponents of the Ecdysozoa hypothesis also recognise in modified form in the details of the nerve patterns of the Panarthropoda. Both groups also share a common skin-shedding mechanism (ecdysis) and molecular biological similarities. One problem of the Ecdysozoa hypothesis is the velvet worms' subterminal position of their mouths: Unlike in the Cycloneuralia, the mouth is not at the front end of the body, but lies further back, under the belly. However, investigations into their developmental biology, particularly regarding the development of the head nerves, suggest that this was not always the case, and that the mouth was originally terminal (situated at the tip of the body). This is supported by the fossil record.\nThe \"stem-group arthropod\" hypothesis is very widely accepted, but some trees suggest that the onychophorans may occupy a different position; their brain anatomy is more closely related to that of the chelicerates than to any other arthropod. The modern velvet worms form a monophyletic group, incorporating all the descendants of their common ancestor. Important common derivative characteristics (synapomorphies) include, for example, the mandibles of the second body segment and the oral papillae and associated slime glands of the third; nerve strands extending along the underside with numerous cross-linkages per segment; and the special form of the tracheae. By 2011, some 180\u00a0modern species, comprising 49\u00a0genera, had been described; the actual number of species is probably about twice this. According to more recent study, 82\u00a0species of Peripatidae and 115\u00a0species of Peripatopsidae have been described thus far. However, among the 197\u00a0species, 20\u00a0are \"nomina dubia\", due to major taxonomic inconsistencies. The best-known is the type genus \"Peripatus\", which was described as early as 1825 and which, in English-speaking countries, stands representative for all velvet worms. All genera are assigned to one of two families, the distribution ranges of which do not overlap but are separated by arid areas or oceans:\nGenomics.\nAs of February 2025, velvet worms have had only two nuclear genomes sequenced. These are of \"Euperipatoides rowelli\" (a peripatopsid) and \"Epiperipatus broadwayi\" (a peripatid). The first one is highly fragmented, while the second is less so, but still needs improvement. Velvet worms seem to display genome gigantism, with the more complete assembly (E. broadwayi) having an size of 5.60 giga-base pairs. Around 70.92% of its genome are repeat sequences, something that contributes to the bulk of its size. While less substantial, it also has very large introns, or parts of a gene that do not become proteins.\nEvolution.\nInsights on decay and fossilization.\nDue to being soft-bodied, onychophorans need excellent conditions to fossilize. However, even when this happens, their fossils can be subject to taphonomic bias. Experiments were done with modern velvet worms to analyze their decomposition in various saline solutions. The study also investigated whether they experienced something called stemward slippage. In this phenomenon, animals are falsely categorized as more primitive due to the decay of certain features.\nThe researchers found that different features decayed at significantly different rates. Salinity and time of moult had little effect on decay, and the way things decomposed remained the same for different species (though it could happen at different speeds). Before any degradation, velvet worms flex into a S, U, or circular shape. Most flexing happens in the first 24 hours, but the process can continue for around two more days. In the early stages of decay, the epidermis and outer cuticle separate, causing a bloated appearance. The elongates while increasing in width by around 10\u201330%. The limbs do the same, increasing in length and width by around 10\u201325%. Around the same time, the internal organs begin to degrade. This eventually culminates in the gut rupturing, destroying the other organs. In later stages of decay, the body cuticle shrinks close to its original size. A similar trend was found with the limbs, but it was just short of being statistically significant. It's around this time that many external features begin to deteriorate. These include the dermal papillae, leg rings, anus, gonopore, antenna, slime papillae, and eventually eyes. Interestingly, the dermal papillae on the trunk disappear faster than those on the limbs. Even as decay progresses, the body is still recognizable. This stops once the outer cuticle finally ruptures. After that, the animal's anatomy is extremely difficult to interpret. At this stage, the only identifiable features would be the chitinous jaws and claws.\nOnychophorans are unlikely to experience any stemward slippage since their defining features (jaws, feet, and slime papillae) are generally decay-resistant. However, decomposition has a significant impact on fossil anatomy. For starters, the preserved body outline is probably somewhat inaccurate, as this gets bloated in the decay process. A similar thing happens with the limbs, so this needs to be accounted for when analyzing locomotion and/or leg length. While fossilized onychophorans can appear to display patterning, these aren't true to life. pigment granules are one of the first things to degrade and can easily move around in the body. Another finding is that characters such as internal organs or the body cavity are highly unlikely to fossilize. If these appear preserved in a fossil, they should be treated with skepticism, especially if they're unmineralized. When it comes to placement of the mouth, even moderate decay makes it hard to tell if it's at the front or underside of the head. Additionally, fossils that lack decay-resistant features probably lacked them in life. This is even more plausible if the fossil preserves decay-prone features, as their presence indicates a better level of preservation. For example, an onychophoran (or related animal) with eyes but no claws likely never had them.\nEmergence from lobopodians.\nCertain fossils from the Early Cambrian bear a striking resemblance to the velvet worms. These fossils, known collectively as lobopodians, were an evolutionary grade that gave rise to arthropods, tardigrades, onychophorans, and the extinct radiodonts.\nHow different lobopodians are related varies from study to study. However, with the exception of a single paper, \"Antennacanthopodia\" is the only animal to be confidently viewed as a close onychophoran relative. \"Antennacanthopodia\" lived during the Cambrian Stage 3 and possessed a variety of onychophoran traits: stubby lobopods, spinous foot pads, an annulated body, and small eyes behind the main antennae. An obvious difference from onychophorans was that the animal had not one, but two pairs of antennae. These secondary antennae were shorter than the first pair and thought to be homologous with either the slime papillae or jaws of velvet worms. When Onychophora first arose or moved onto land is currently unknown. However, it could have plausibly happened between the Ordovician and Silurian \u2013 approximately https:// Late Silurian \u2013 via the intertidal zone.\nVelvet worms and their diversification.\nThe earliest potential onychophoran, \"Helenodora\", originates from the Mid Pennsylvanian Mazon Creek lagerst\u00e4tte in the United States. Originally described in 1980, Helenodora was long regarded as the earliest known onychophoran. This changed in 2016 when a paper by Murdock et al. doubted its affinity. Based on the absence of many decay-resistant features (claws, jaws, slime papillae) and unclear ecology (\"Carbotubulus\", a late-surviving aquatic lobopodian, was found in the same formation), the authors of this study placed \"Helenodora\" as a basal lobopodian most closely related to \"Paucipodia\". \nThe earliest definite onychophoran is the French \"Antennipatus\" from a Stephanian (Late Pennsylvanian) Lagerst\u00e4tte in Montceau-les-Mines. This animal had a ventral (bottom facing) mouth, rings of dermal papillae on its trunk and limbs, and was at least somewhat terrestrial because of its slime papillae. However, due to the way it was preserved, it is unknown if \"Antennipatus\" belonged to the stem or crown group of the two living families of velvet worm (Peripatidae and Peripatopsidae).\nBased on molecular dating, crown-group onychophorans diverged around 376 million years ago in the Late Devonian. This estimation happens regardless if \"Antennipatus\" is used to constrain the divergence date, or if no calibration is done at all. The earliest known crown-group onychophoran, \"Cretoperipatus\", is known from multiple specimens in Burmese amber. All are from the same general location and date to a maximum age of around 98.79 million years ago (the earliest Cenomanian of the Late Cretaceous). Based on its morphology, \"Cretoperipatus\" was early-diverging member of Peripatidae, most closely related to the Asian genera \"Eoperipatus\" and \"Typhloperipatus\". \nDespite being preserved in amber, the affinities of the Cenozoic \"Tertiapatus\" and \"Succinipatopsis\" are surrounded in controversy. Some sources consider them to be onychophorans, while others dismiss this. Ultimately, these animals should be reanalyzed to better grasp their position on the tree of life.\nConservation status.\nThe global conservation status of velvet worm species is difficult to estimate; many species are only found their type locality (the location at which they were first observed and described). The collection of reliable data is also hindered by velvet worms' low population densities, their typically nocturnal behavior, and possibly as-yet undocumented seasonal influences and sexual dimorphism. To date, the only onychophorans evaluated by the IUCN are: \nThe primary threat to velvet worms comes from destruction and fragmentation of their habitat due to industrialisation, draining of wetlands, and slash-and-burn agriculture. As mentioned above, many species also have naturally low population densities and closely restricted geographic ranges. As a result, localized disturbances of important ecosystems could lead to the extinction of entire populations or species. Collection of specimens for universities or research institutes also plays a role on a local scale. \nThere is a very pronounced difference in the protection afforded to velvet worms between regions: in some countries, such as South Africa, there are restrictions on both collecting and exporting, while in others, such as Australia, only export restrictions exist. Many countries offer no specific safeguards at all. Tasmania has a protection program that is unique worldwide: one region of forest has its own velvet worm conservation plan tailored to a particular species (\"Tasmanipatus barretti\").\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Most ribbon worms are very slim, usually only a few millimeters wide, although a few have relatively short but wide bodies. Many have patterns of yellow, orange, red and green coloration.\nThe foregut, stomach and intestine run a little below the midline of the body, the anus is at the tip of the tail, and the mouth is under the front. A little above the gut is the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;rhynchocoel, a cavity which mostly runs above the midline and ends a little short of the rear of the body. All species have a proboscis which lies in the rhynchocoel when inactive but everts to emerge just above the mouth to capture the animal's prey with venom. A highly extensible muscle in the back of the rhynchocoel pulls the proboscis in when an attack ends. A few species with stubby bodies filter feed and have suckers at the front and back ends, with which they attach to a host.\nThe brain is a ring of four ganglia, positioned around the rhynchocoel near the animal's front end. At least a pair of ventral nerve cords connect to the brain and run along the length of the body. Most nemerteans have various chemoreceptors, and on their heads some species have a number of pigment-cup ocelli, which can detect light but can not form an image. Nemerteans respire through the skin. They have at least two lateral vessels which are joined at the ends to form a loop, and these and the rhynchocoel are filled with fluid. There is no heart, and the flow of fluid depends on contraction of muscles in the vessels and the body wall. To filter out soluble waste products, flame cells are embedded in the front part of the two lateral fluid vessels, and remove the wastes through a network of pipes to the outside.\nAll nemerteans move slowly, using their external cilia to glide on surfaces on a trail of slime, while larger species use muscular waves to crawl, and some swim by dorso-ventral undulations. A few live in the open ocean while the rest find or make hiding places on the bottom. About a dozen species inhabit freshwater, mainly in the tropics and subtropics, and another dozen species live on land in cool, damp places. Most nemerteans are carnivores, feeding on annelids, clams and crustaceans. Some species of nemerteans are scavengers, and a few live commensally inside the mantle cavity of molluscs. \nIn most species the sexes are separate, but all the freshwater species are hermaphroditic. Nemerteans often have numerous temporary gonads (ovaries or testes), and build temporary gonoducts (ducts from which the ova or sperm are emitted) opening to a gonopore, one per gonad, when the ova and sperm are ready. The eggs are generally fertilised externally. Some species shed them into the water, and others protect their eggs in various ways. The fertilized egg divides by spiral cleavage and grows by determinate development, in which the fate of a cell can usually be predicted from its predecessors in the process of division. The embryos of most taxa develop either directly to form juveniles (like the adult but smaller) or larvae that resemble the planulas of cnidarians. However, some form a pilidium larva, in which the developing juvenile has a gut which lies across the larva's body, and usually eats the remains of the larva when it emerges. The bodies of some species fragment readily, and even parts cut off near the tail can grow full bodies.\nTraditional taxonomy divides the phylum in two classes, Anopla (\"unarmed\" \u2013 their proboscises do not have a little dagger) with two orders, and Enopla (\"armed\" with a dagger) also with two orders. However, it is now accepted that Anopla are paraphyletic, as one order of Anopla is more closely related to Enopla than to the other order of Anopla. The phylum Nemertea itself is monophyletic, its main synapomorphies being the rhynchocoel and eversible proboscis. Traditional taxonomy says that nemerteans are closely related to flatworms, but both phyla are regarded as members of the Lophotrochozoa, a very large clade, sometimes viewed as a superphylum that also includes molluscs, annelids, brachiopods, bryozoa and many other protostomes.\nHistory.\nIn 1555 Olaus Magnus wrote of a marine worm which was apparently long (\"40 cubits\"), about the width of a child's arm, and whose touch made a hand swell. William Borlase wrote in 1758 of a \"sea long worm\", and in 1770 Gunnerus wrote a formal description of this animal, which he called \"Ascaris longissima\". Its current name, \"Lineus longissimus\", was first used in 1806 by Sowerby. In 1995, a total of 1,149 species had been described and grouped into 250 genera.\nNemertea are named after the Greek sea-nymph Nemertes, one of the daughters of Nereus and Doris. Alternative names for the phylum have included \"Nemertini\", \"Nemertinea\", and \"Rhynchocoela\". The Nemertodermatida are a separate phylum, whose closest relatives appear to be the Acoela.\nDescription.\nBody structure and major cavities.\nThe typical nemertean body is very thin in proportion to its length. The smallest are a few millimeters long, most are less than , and several exceed . The longest animal ever found, at long, may be a specimen of \"Lineus longissimus\", Ruppert, Fox and Barnes refer to a \"Lineus longissimus\" long, washed ashore after a storm off St Andrews in Scotland. Other estimates are about . Zoologists find it extremely difficult to measure this species. For comparison:\n\"L. longissimus\", however, is usually only a few millimeters wide. The bodies of most nemerteans can stretch a lot, up to 10 times their resting length in some species, but reduce their length to 50% and increase their width to 300% when disturbed. A few have relatively short but wide bodies, for example \"Malacobdella grossa\" is up to long and wide, and some of these are much less stretchy. Smaller nemerteans are approximately cylindrical, but larger species are flattened dorso-ventrally. Many have visible patterns in various combinations of yellow, orange, red and green.\nThe outermost layer of the body has no cuticle, but consists of a ciliated and glandular epithelium containing rhabdites, which form the mucus in which the cilia glide. Each ciliated cell has many cilia and microvilli. The outermost layer rests on a thickened basement membrane, the dermis. Next to the dermis are at least three layers of muscles, some circular and some longitudinal. The combinations of muscle types vary between the different classes, but these are not associated with differences in movement. Nemerteans also have dorso-ventral muscles, which flatten the animals, especially in the larger species. Inside the concentric tubes of these layers is mesenchyme, a kind of connective tissue. In pelagic species this tissue is gelatinous and buoyant.\nThey are unsegmented, but at least one species, Annulonemertes minusculus, is segmented. But this is assumed to be a derived trait. The segmentation does not include the coelom and body wall, and is therefore referred to as pseudosegmentation.\nThe mouth is ventral and a little behind the front of the body. The foregut, stomach and intestine run a little below the midline of the body and the anus is at the tip of the tail. Above the gut and separated from the gut by mesenchyme is the rhynchocoel, a cavity which mostly runs above the midline and ends a little short of the rear of the body. The rhynchocoel of class Anopla has an orifice a little to the front of the mouth, but still under the front of the body. In the other class, Enopla, the mouth and the front of the rhynchocoel share an orifice. The rhynchocoel is a coelom, as it is lined by epithelium.\nProboscis and feeding.\nThe proboscis is an infolding of the body wall, and sits in the rhynchocoel when inactive. When muscles in the wall of the rhynchocoel compress the fluid inside, the pressure makes the proboscis jump inside-out along a canal called the rhynchodeum and through an orifice, the proboscis pore. The proboscis has a muscle which attaches to the back of the rhynchocoel, can stretch up to 30 times its inactive length and acts to retract the proboscis.\nThe proboscis of the class Anopla exits from an orifice which is separate from the mouth, coils around the prey and immobilizes it by sticky, toxic secretions. The Anopla can attack as soon as the prey moves into the range of the proboscis. Some Anopla have branched proboscises which can be described as \"a mass of sticky spaghetti\". The animal then draws its prey into its mouth.\nIn most of the class Enopla, the proboscis exits from a common orifice of the rhynchocoel and mouth. A typical member of this class has a stylet, a calcareous barb, with which the animal stabs the prey many times to inject toxins and digestive secretions. The prey is then swallowed whole or, after partial digestion, its tissues are sucked into the mouth. The stylet is attached about one-third of the distance from the end of the everted proboscis, which extends only enough to expose the stylet. On either side of the active stylet are sacs containing back-up stylets to replace the active one as the animal grows or an active one is lost. Instead of one stylet, the Polystilifera have a pad that bears many tiny stylets, and these animals have separate orifices for the proboscis and mouth, unlike other Enopla. The Enopla can only attack after contacting the prey.\nSome nemerteans, such as \"L. longissimus\", absorb organic food in solution through their skins, which may make the long, slim bodies an advantage. Suspension feeding is found only among the specialized symbiotic bdellonemerteans, which have a proboscis but no stylet, and use suckers to attach themselves to bivalves.\nRespiration and circulatory system.\nNemerteans lack specialized gills, and respiration occurs over the surface of the body, which is long and sometimes flattened. Like other animals with thick body walls, they use fluid circulation rather than diffusion to move substances through their bodies. The circulatory system consists of the rhynchocoel and peripheral vessels, while their blood is contained in the main body cavity. The fluid in the rhynchocoel moves substances to and from the proboscis, and functions as a fluid skeleton in everting the proboscis and in burrowing. The vessels circulate fluid round the whole body and the rhynchocoel provides its own local circulation. The circulatory vessels are a system of coeloms.\nIn the simplest type of circulatory system, two lateral vessels are joined at the ends to form a loop. However, many species have additional long-wise and cross-wise vessels. There is no heart nor pumping vessels, and the flow of fluid depends on contraction of both the vessels and the body wall's muscles. In some species, circulation is intermittent, and fluid ebbs and flows in the long-wise vessels. The fluid in the vessels is usually colorless, but in some species it contains cells that are yellow, orange, green or red. The red type contain hemoglobin and carry oxygen, but the function of the other pigments is unknown.\nExcretion.\nNemertea use organs called protonephridia to excrete soluble waste products, especially nitrogenous by-products of cellular metabolism. In nemertean protonephridia, flame cells which filter out the wastes are embedded in the front part of the two lateral fluid vessels. The flame cells remove the wastes into two collecting ducts, one on either side, and each duct has one or more nephridiopores through which the wastes exit. Semiterrestrial and freshwater nemerteans have many more flame cells than marines, sometimes thousands. The reason may be that osmoregulation is more difficult in non-marine environments.\nNervous-system and senses.\nThe central nervous-system consists of a brain and paired ventral nerve cords that connect to the brain and run along the length of the body. The brain is a ring of four ganglia, masses of nerve cells, positioned round the rhynchocoel near its front end \u2013 while the brains of most protostome invertebrates encircle the foregut. Most nemertean species have just one pair of nerve cords, many species have additional paired cords, and some species also have a dorsal cord. In some species the cords lie within the skin, but in most they are deeper, inside the muscle layers. The central nervous-system is often red or pink because it contains hemoglobin. This stores oxygen for peak activity or when the animal experiences anoxia, for example while burrowing in oxygen-free sediments.\nSome species have paired cerebral organs, sacs whose only openings are to the outside. Others species have unpaired evertible organs on the front of their heads. Some have slits along the side of the head or grooves obliquely across the head, and these may be associated with paired cerebral organs. All of these are thought to be chemoreceptors, and the cerebral organs may also aiding osmoregulation. Small pits in the epidermis appear to be sensors. On their head, some species have a number of pigment-cup ocelli, which can detect light but not form an image. Most nemerteans have two to six ocelli, although some have hundreds. A few tiny species that live between grains of sand have statocysts, which sense balance.\n\"Paranemertes peregrina\", which feeds on polychaetes, can follow the prey's trails of mucus, and find its burrow by backtracking along its own trail of mucus.\nMovement.\nNemerteans generally move slowly, though they have occasionally been documented to successfully prey on spiders or insects. Most nemerteans use their external cilia to glide on surfaces on a trail of slime, some of which is produced by glands in the head. Larger species use muscular waves to crawl, and some aquatic species swim by dorso-ventral undulations. Some species burrow by means of muscular peristalsis, and have powerful muscles. Some species of the suborder Monostilifera, whose proboscis have one active stylet, move by extending the proboscis, sticking it to an object and pulling the animal toward the object.\nReproduction and life-cycle.\nLarger species often break up when stimulated, and the fragments often grow into full individuals. Some species fragment routinely and even parts near the tail can grow full bodies. But this kind of extreme regeneration is restricted to only a few types of nemerteans, and is assumed to be a derived feature. All reproduce sexually, and most species are gonochoric (the sexes are separate), but all the freshwater forms are hermaphroditic.\nNemerteans often have numerous temporary gonads (ovaries or testes), forming a row down each side of the body in the mesenchyme. Temporary gonoducts (ducts from which the ova or sperm are emitted), one per gonad, are built when the ova and sperm are ready. The eggs are generally fertilised externally. Some species shed them into the water, some lay them in a burrow or tube, and some protect them by cocoons or gelatinous strings. Some bathypelagic (deep sea) species have internal fertilization, and some of these are viviparous, growing their embryos in the female's body.\nThe zygote (fertilised egg) divides by spiral cleavage and grows by determinate development, in which the fate of a cell can usually be predicted from its predecessors in the process of division. The embryos of most taxa develop either directly to form juveniles (like the adult but smaller) or to form planuliform larvae. The planuliform larva stage may be short-lived and lecithotrophic (\"yolky\") before becoming a juvenile, or may be planktotrophic, swimming for some time and eating prey larger than microscopic particles. However, many members of the order Heteronemertea and the palaeonemertean family Hubrechtiidae form a pilidium larva, which can capture unicellular algae and which Maslakova describes as like a deerstalker cap with the ear flaps pulled down. It has a gut which lies across the body, a mouth between the \"ear flaps\", but no anus. A small number of imaginal discs form, encircling the archenteron (developing gut) and coalesce to form the juvenile. When it is fully formed, the juvenile bursts out of the larva body and usually eats it during this catastrophic metamorphosis. This larval stage is unique in that there are no Hox genes involved during development, which are only found in the juveniles developing inside the larvae.\nThe species \"Paranemertes peregrina\" has been reported as having a life span of around 18 months.\nEcological significance.\nMost nemerteans are marine animals that burrow in sediments, lurk in crevices between shells, stones or the holdfasts of algae or sessile animals. Some live deep in the open oceans, and have gelatinous bodies. Others build semi-permanent burrows lined with mucus or produce cellophane-like tubes. Mainly in the tropics and subtropics, about 12 species appear in freshwater, and about a dozen species live on land in cool, damp places, for example under rotting logs.\nThe terrestrial \"Argonemertes dendyi\" is a native of Australia but has been found in the British Isles, in Sao Miguel in the Azores, in Gran Canaria, and in a lava tube at Kaumana on the Island of Hawaii. It can build a cocoon, which allows it to avoid desiccation while being transported, and it may be able to build populations quickly in new areas as it is a protandrous hermaphrodite. Another terrestrial genus, \"Geonemertes\", is mostly found in Australasia but has species in the Seychelles, widely across the Indo-Pacific, in Tristan da Cunha in the South Atlantic, in Frankfurt, in the Canary Islands, in Madeira and in the Azores. \"Geonemertes pelaensis\" has been implicated in the decline of native arthropod species on the Ogasawara Islands, where it was introduced in the 1980s.\nMost are carnivores, feeding on annelids, clams and crustaceans, and may kill annelids of about their own size. They sometimes take fish, both living and dead. Insects and myriapods are the only known prey of the two terrestrial species of \"Argonemertes\".\nA few nemerteans are scavengers, and these generally have good distance chemoreception (\"smell\") and are not selective about their prey. A few species live commensally inside the mantle cavity of molluscs and feed on micro-organisms filtered out by the host.\nNear San Francisco the nemertean \"Carcinonemertes errans\" has consumed about 55% of the total egg production of its host, the dungeness crab \"Metacarcinus magister\". \"C. errans\" is considered a significant factor in the collapse of the dungeness crab fishery. Other coastal nemerteans have devastated clam beds.\nThe few predators on nemerteans include bottom-feeding fish, some sea birds, a few invertebrates including horseshoe crabs, and other nemerteans. Nemerteans' skins secrete toxins that deter many predators, but some crabs may clean nemerteans with one claw before eating them. The American \"Cerebratulus lacteus\" and the South African \"Polybrachiorhynchus dayi\", both called \"tapeworms\" in their respective localities, are sold as fish bait.\nTaxonomy.\nTraditional taxonomic classification has divided the group into two classes and four orders:\nRecent molecular phylogenetic studies divided the group into two superclasses, three classes, and eight orders:\nEvolutionary history.\nFossil record.\nAs nemerteans are mostly soft-bodied, one would expect fossils of them to be extremely rare. One might expect the stylet of a nemertean to be preserved, since it is made of calcium phosphate, but no fossil stylets have yet been found. reported nemertean fossils and traces from the Middle Triassic of Germany.\nThe Middle Cambrian fossil \"Amiskwia\" from the Burgess Shale has been classed as a nemertean, based on a resemblance to some unusual deep-sea swimming nemerteans, but few paleontologists accept this classification as the Burgess Shale fossils show no evidence of rhynchocoel nor intestinal caeca.\n reported fossils of vermiform organisms with a wide range of morphologies occurring on bedding planes from the Late Ordovician (Katian) Vaur\u00e9al Formation (Canada). In the specimens preserving the anterior end of the body, this end is pointed or rounded, bearing a rhynchocoel with the proboscis, which is characteristic for nemerteans. The authors attributed these fossils to nemerteans and interpreted them as the oldest record of the group reported so far. However, Knaust &amp; Desrochers cautioned that partly preserved putative nemertean fossils might ultimately turn out to be fossils of turbellarians or annelids.\nIt has been suggested that \"Archisymplectes\", one of the Pennsylvanian-age animals from Mazon Creek in northern and central Illinois, may be a nemertean.\nThis fossil, however, only preserves the outline of the \"worm\", and there is no evidence of a proboscis,\nso there is no certainty that it represents a nemertean.\nWithin Nemertea.\n Groups within Nemertea, by .&lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0\u00a0 highlights the \"Anopla\", which are paraphyletic.\nThere is no doubt that the phylum Nemertea is monophyletic (meaning that the phylum includes all and only descendants of one ancestor that was also a member of the phylum). The synapomorphies (trait shared by an ancestor and all its descendants, but not by other groups) include the eversible proboscis located in the rhynchocoel.\nWhile treat the Palaeonemertea as monophyletic, regard them as paraphyletic and basal (contains the ancestors of the more recent clades). The Anopla (\"unarmed\") represent an evolutionary grade of nemerteans without stylets (comprising the Heteronemertea and the Palaeonemerteans), while Enopla (\"armed\") are monophyletic, but find that Palaeonemertea is doubly paraphyletic, having given rise to both the Heteronemertea and the Enopla. treat the Bdellonemertea as a clade separate from the Hoplonemertea, while believe the Bdellonemertea are a part of the Monostilifera (with one active stylet), which are within the Hoplonemertea \u2013 which implies that \"Enopla\" and \"Hoplonemertea\" are synonyms for the same branch of the tree. The Polystilifera (with many tiny stylets) are monophyletic.\nRelationships with other phyla.\nEnglish-language writings have conventionally treated nemerteans as acoelomate bilaterians that are most closely related to flatworms (Platyhelminthes). These pre-cladistics analyses emphasised as shared features: multiciliated (with multiple cilia per cell), glandular epidermis; rod-shaped secretory bodies or rhabdites; frontal glands or organs; protonephridia; and acoelomate body organization. However, multiciliated epidermal cells and epidermal gland cells are also found in Ctenophora, Annelida, Mollusca and other taxa. The rhabdites of nemertea have a different structure from those of flatworms at the microscopic scale. The frontal glands or organs of flatworms vary a lot in structure, and similar structures appear in small marine annelids and entoproct larvae. The protonephridia of nemertea and flatworms are different in structure, and in position \u2013 the flame cells of nemertea are usually in the walls of the fluid vessels and are served by \"drains\" from which the wastes exit by a small number of tubes through the skin, while the flame cells of flatworms are scattered throughout the body.https://\nRigorous comparisons show no synapomorphies of nemertean and platyhelminth nephridia.\nAccording to more recent analyses, in the development of nemertean embryos, ectomesoderm (outer part of the mesoderm, which is the layer in which most of the internal organs are built) is derived from cells labelled 3a and 3b, and endomesoderm (inner part of the mesoderm) is derived from the 4d cell. Some of the ectomesoderm in annelids, echiurans and molluscs is derived from cells 3a and 3b, while the ectomesoderm of polyclad flatworms is derived from the 2b cell and acoel flatworms produce no ectomesoderm. In nemerteans the space between the epidermis and the gut is mainly filled by well-developed muscles embedded in noncellular connective tissue. This structure is similar to that found in larger flatworms such as polyclads and triclads, but a similar structure of body-wall muscles embedded in noncellular connective tissue is widespread among the Spiralia (animals in which the early cell divisions make a spiral pattern) such as sipunculans, echiurans and many annelids.\n Relationships of Nemertea to other Bilateria:\nNemerteans' affinities with Annelida (including Echiura, Pogonophora, Vestimentifera and perhaps Sipuncula) and Mollusca make the ribbon-worms members of Lophotrochozoa, which include about half of the extant animal phyla. Lophotrochozoa groups: those animals that feed using a lophophore (Brachiopoda, Bryozoa, Phoronida, Entoprocta); phyla in which most members' embryos develop into trochophore larvae (for example Annelida and Mollusca); and some other phyla (such as Platyhelminthes, Sipuncula, Gastrotricha, Gnathostomulida, Micrognathozoa, Nemertea, Phoronida, Platyhelminthes, and Rotifera).\nThese groupings are based on molecular phylogeny, which compares sections of organisms DNA and RNA. While analyses by molecular phylogeny are confident that members of Lophotrochozoa are more closely related to each other than of non-members, the relationships between members are mostly unclear.\nMost protostome phyla outside the Lophotrochozoa are members of Ecdysozoa (\"animals that molt\"), which include Arthropoda, Nematoda and Priapulida. Most other bilaterian phyla are in the Deuterostomia, which include Echinodermata and Chordata. The Acoelomorpha, which are neither protostomes nor deuterostomes, are regarded as basal bilaterians.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The play is set in Athens, and consists of several subplots that revolve around the marriage of Theseus and Hippolyta. One subplot involves a conflict among four Athenian lovers. Another follows a group of six amateur actors rehearsing the play which they are to perform before the wedding. Both groups find themselves in a forest inhabited by fairies who manipulate the humans and are engaged in their own domestic intrigue. \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" is one of Shakespeare's most popular and widely performed plays.\nCharacters.\nThe Athenians:\nThe Mechanicals:\nThe Fairies:\nPlot.\nThe play consists of several interconnecting plots, connected by a celebration of the wedding of Duke Theseus of Athens and the Amazon queen Hippolyta.\nMost of the action occurs in the woodland realm of Fairyland, under the light of the moon.\nAct 1.\nAct 1 Scene 1.\nThe play opens with Theseus and Hippolyta who are four days away from their wedding. Theseus is unhappy about how long he has to wait while Hippolyta thinks it will pass by like a dream. Theseus is confronted by Egeus and his daughter Hermia, who is in love with Lysander, and resistant to her father's demand that she marry Demetrius, whom he has arranged for her to marry. Enraged, Egeus invokes an ancient Athenian law before Duke Theseus, whereby a daughter needs to marry a suitor chosen by her father, or else face death. Theseus offers her another choice: lifelong chastity as a nun worshipping the goddess Diana, but the two lovers both deny his choice and make a secret plan to escape into the forest for Lysander's aunt's house, to run away from Theseus. Hermia tells their plans to Helena, her best friend, who pines unrequitedly for Demetrius, who broke up with her to be with Hermia. Desperate to reclaim Demetrius's love, Helena tells Demetrius about the plan and he follows them in hopes of finding Hermia.\nAct 1 Scene 2.\nThe mechanicals, Peter Quince and fellow players Nick Bottom, Francis Flute, Robin Starveling, Tom Snout and Snug plan to put on a play for the wedding of the Duke and the Queen, \"the most lamentable comedy and most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisbe\". Quince reads the names of characters and bestows them on the players. Nick Bottom, who is playing the main role of Pyramus, is over-enthusiastic and wants to dominate others by suggesting himself for the characters of Thisbe, the Lion, and Pyramus at the same time. Quince insists that Bottom can only play the role of Pyramus. Bottom would also rather play a tyrant and recites some lines of Ercles. Bottom is told by Quince that he would play the Lion so terribly as to frighten the duchess and other ladies so much that the Duke and Lords would have the players hanged. Snug remarks that he needs Lion's part because he is \"slow of study\". Quince assures Snug that the role of the lion is \"nothing but roaring.\" Quince then ends the meeting by telling his actors \"At the Duke's oak we meet\".\nAct 2.\nAct 2 Scene 1.\nIn a parallel plot line, at the same time, Oberon, king of the fairies, and Titania, his queen, have come to the forest outside Athens. Titania tells Oberon that she plans to stay there until she has attended Theseus and Hippolyta's wedding. Oberon and Titania are estranged because Titania refuses to give her Indian changeling to Oberon for use as his \"knight\" or \"henchman\" since the child's mother was one of Titania's worshippers. Oberon seeks to punish Titania. He calls upon Robin \"Puck\" Goodfellow, his \"shrewd and knavish sprite\", to help him concoct a magical juice derived from a flower called \"love-in-idleness\", which turns from white to purple when struck by Cupid's arrow. When the concoction is applied to the eyelids of a sleeping person, that person, upon waking, falls in love with the first living thing they perceive. He instructs Puck to retrieve the flower with the hope that he might make Titania fall in love with an animal of the forest and thereby shame her into giving up the little Indian boy. He says, \"And ere I take this charm from off her sight, / As I can take it with another herb, / I'll make her render up her page to me.\" Helena and Demetrius enter, with her continuously making advances towards Demetrius, promising to love him more than Hermia. However, he rebuffs her with cruel insults. Observing this, Oberon orders Puck to spread some of the magical juice from the flower on the eyelids of the young Athenian man.\nAct 2 Scene 2.\nAs Titania is lulled to sleep by her fairies, Oberon sneaks up and places the flower juice on her eyes, exiting the stage afterwards. Lysander and Hermia enter, lost and exhausted from the journey. Hermia rejects Lysander's advances to sleep together, and the two lie down on different corners. Puck enters and mistakes Lysander for Demetrius, not having seen either before, and administers the juice to the sleeping Lysander. Helena, coming across him, wakes him while attempting to determine whether he is dead or asleep. Upon this happening, Lysander immediately falls in love with Helena. Helena, mistakenly accusing Lysander of mocking her, runs away. Lysander follows her. When Hermia wakes up after dreaming a snake ate her heart, she sees that Lysander is gone and goes out in the woods to find him.\nAct 3.\nAct 3 Scene 1.\nMeanwhile, Quince and his band of five labourers (\"rude mechanicals\", as Puck describes them) have arranged to perform their play about Pyramus and Thisbe for Theseus's wedding and venture into the forest, near Titania's bower, for their rehearsal. Quince leads the actors in their rehearsal of the play. Bottom is spotted by Puck, who (taking his name to be another word for a jackass) transforms his head into that of a donkey. When Bottom returns for his next lines, the other workmen run screaming in terror: They claim that they are haunted, much to Bottom's confusion. Determined to await his friends, he begins to sing to himself. Titania, having received the love potion, is awakened by Bottom's singing and immediately falls in love with him. (In the words of the play, \"Titania waked, and straightway loved an ass.\") She lavishes him with her attention and that of her fairies; while she is in this state of devotion, Oberon takes the changeling boy.\nAct 3 Scene 2.\nOberon sees Demetrius still following Hermia. When Demetrius goes to sleep, Oberon condemns Puck's mistake and sends him to get Helena while he charms Demetrius's eyes. Upon waking, Demetrius sees Helena arguing with Lysander, and instantly falls in love with her. Now under the spell, the two men are both in love with a Helena convinced that both of her two suitors are mocking her, as neither loved her originally. Hermia finds Lysander and asks why he left her, but Lysander claims he never loved Hermia, instead loving Helena. This soon turns into a quarrel between the two ladies, with Helena chiding Hermia for joining in the mockery session, followed by the latter furiously charging at her for stealing her true love's heart and blaming her for the supposed 'mockery'. Oberon and Puck decide that they must resolve this conflict, and by the morning, none of them will have any memory of what happened, as if it were a dream. Oberon arranges everything so Helena, Hermia, Demetrius, and Lysander will all believe they have been dreaming when they awaken. Puck distracts Lysander and Demetrius from fighting over Helena's love by mimicking their voices and leading them apart. Eventually, all four find themselves separately falling asleep in the glade. Once they fall asleep, Puck administers the antidote to Lysander, returning his love to Hermia again. Once they awaken, the lovers assume that whatever happened was a dream and not reality.\nAct 4.\nAct 4 Scene 1.\nHaving achieved his goals, Oberon releases Titania and orders Puck to remove the donkey's head from Bottom. The fairies then disappear, and Theseus and Hippolyta arrive on the scene, during an early morning hunt. They find the lovers still sleeping in the glade. They wake up the lovers and, since Demetrius no longer loves Hermia, Theseus over-rules Egeus's demands and arranges a group wedding. The lovers at first believe they are still in a dream and cannot recall what has happened. The lovers decide that the night's events must have been a dream, as they walk back to Athens.\nAct 4 Scene 2.\nAfter they exit, Bottom awakes, and he too decides that he must have experienced a dream \"past the wit of man\". At Quince's house, Quince and his team of actors worry that Bottom has gone missing. Quince laments that Bottom is the only man who can take on the lead role of Pyramus. Bottom returns and the actors get ready to put on \"Pyramus and Thisbe\".\nAct 5.\nIn the final scene of the play, Theseus, Hippolyta and the lovers watch the six workmen perform \"Pyramus and Thisbe\" in Athens. The mechanicals are so terrible at playing their roles that the guests laugh as if it were meant to be a comedy, and everyone retires to bed. Afterwards, Oberon, Titania, Puck, and other fairies enter, and bless the house and its occupants with good fortune. After all the other characters leave, Puck \"restores amends\" and suggests that what the audience experienced might just be a dream.\nSources.\nIt is unknown exactly when \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" was written or first performed, but on the basis of topical references and an allusion to Edmund Spenser's \"Epithalamion\", it is usually dated 1595 or early 1596. Some have theorised that the play might have been written for an aristocratic wedding (for example that of Thomas Berkeley and Elizabeth Carey), while others suggest that it was written for the Queen to celebrate the feast day of St. John, but no evidence exists to support this theory. In any case, it would have been performed at The Theatre and, later, The Globe. Though it is not a translation or adaptation of an earlier work, various sources such as Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\" and Chaucer's \"The Knight's Tale\" served as inspiration. Aristophanes' classical Greek comedy \"The Birds\" (also set in the countryside near Athens) has been proposed as a source due to the fact that both Procne and Titania are awakened by male characters (Hoopoe and Bottom the Weaver) who have animal heads and who sing two-stanza songs about birds. According to John Twyning, the play's plot of four lovers undergoing a trial in the woods was intended as a \"riff\" on \"Der Busant\", a Middle High German poem.\nAccording to Dorothea Kehler, the writing period can be placed between 1594 and 1596, which means that Shakespeare had probably already completed \"Romeo and Juliet\" and was still in contemplation of \"The Merchant of Venice\". The play belongs to the author's early-middle period, a time when Shakespeare devoted primary attention to the lyricism of his works.\nDate and text.\nThe play was entered into the Register of the Stationers' Company on 8 October 1600 by the bookseller Thomas Fisher, who published the first quarto edition later that year. A second quarto was printed in 1619 by William Jaggard, as part of his so-called False Folio. The play next appeared in print in the First Folio of 1623. The title page of Q1 states that the play was \"sundry times publickely acted\" prior to 1600. According to Sukanta Chaudhuri, editor of the 2017 Arden edition of A Midsummer Night's Dream, \"The only firm evidence for the date of Dream is its mention in Francis Meres's Palladis Tamia, which appeared in 1598\" (p. 283). Chaudhuri's exhaustive investigation of its original date of performance points to 1595 or 1596 (likely for the wedding of either William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby to Elizabeth de Vere, or Thomas Berkeley, son of Henry Lord Berkeley, to Elizabeth Carey) (p. 284-5). Further consolidations of this late Elizabethan date are provided by \"Oberon's unmissable compliment to Queen Elizabeth (2.1.155-164)\" (Chaudhuri), and Titania's description of flooded fields and failed crops which occurred through England in the years 1594-1597/8 (2.1.84-121). The first court performance known with certainty occurred at Hampton Court on 1 January 1604, as a prelude to \"The Masque of Indian and China Knights\".\nThemes.\nLovers' bliss.\nIn Ancient Greece, long before the creation of the Christian celebrations of St. John's Day, the summer solstice was marked by Adonia, a festival to mourn the death of Adonis, the devoted mortal lover of the goddess Aphrodite. According to Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\", Aphrodite took the orphaned infant Adonis to the underworld to be raised by Persephone. He grew to be a beautiful young man, and when Aphrodite returned to retrieve him, Persephone did not want to let him go. Zeus settled the dispute by giving Adonis one-third of the year with Persephone, one-third of the year with Aphrodite, and the remaining third where he chose. Adonis chose to spend two-thirds of the year with his paramour, Aphrodite. He bled to death in his lover's arms after being gored by a boar. Mythology has various stories attributing the colour of certain flowers to staining by the blood of Adonis or Aphrodite.\nThe story of Venus and Adonis was well known to the Elizabethans and inspired many works, including Shakespeare's own hugely popular narrative poem, \"Venus and Adonis\", written while London's theatres were closed because of plague. It was published in 1593.\nThe wedding of Theseus and Hippolyta and the mistaken and waylaid lovers, Titania and Bottom, even the erstwhile acting troupe, model various aspects (and forms) of love.\nCarnivalesque.\nBoth David Wiles of the University of London and Harold Bloom of Yale University have strongly endorsed the reading of this play under the themes of Carnivalesque, Bacchanalia, and Saturnalia. Writing in 1998, David Wiles stated that: \"The starting point for my own analysis will be the proposition that although we encounter \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" as a text, it was historically part of an aristocratic carnival. It was written for a wedding, and part of the festive structure of the wedding night. The audience who saw the play in the public theatre in the months that followed became vicarious participants in an aristocratic festival from which they were physically excluded. My purpose will be to demonstrate how closely the play is integrated with a historically specific upper-class celebration.\" Wiles argued in 1993 that the play was written to celebrate the Carey-Berkeley wedding. The date of the wedding was fixed to coincide with a conjunction of Venus and the new moon, highly propitious for conceiving an heir.\nLove.\nDavid Bevington argues that the play represents the dark side of love. He writes that the fairies make light of love by mistaking the lovers and by applying a love potion to Queen Titania's eyes, forcing her to fall in love with an ass. In the forest, both couples are beset by problems. Hermia and Lysander are both met by Puck, who provides some comic relief in the play by confounding the four lovers in the forest. However, the play also alludes to serious themes. At the end of the play, Hippolyta and Theseus, happily married, watch the play about the unfortunate lovers, Pyramus and Thisbe, and are able to enjoy and laugh at it. Helena and Demetrius are both oblivious to the dark side of their love, totally unaware of what may have come of the events in the forest.\nProblem with time.\nThere is a dispute over the scenario of the play as it is cited at first by Theseus that \"four happy days bring in another moon\". The wood episode then takes place at a night of no Moon, but Lysander asserts that \"there will be so much light in the very night they will escape that dew on the grass will be shining like liquid pearls.\" Also, in the next scene, Quince states that they will rehearse in moonlight, which creates a real confusion. It is possible that the Moon set during the night allowing Lysander to escape in the moonlight and for the actors to rehearse, then for the wood episode to occur without moonlight. Theseus's statement can also be interpreted to mean \"four days until the next month\". Another possibility is that, since each month there are roughly four consecutive nights that the Moon is not seen due to its closeness to the Sun in the sky (the two nights before the moment of new moon, followed by the two following it), it may in this fashion indicate a liminal \"dark of the moon\" period full of magical possibilities. This is further supported by Hippolyta's opening lines exclaiming \"And then the moon, like to a silver bow New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night of our solemnities.\"; the thin crescent-shaped moon being the hallmark of the new moon's return to the skies each month. The play also intertwines the Midsummer Eve of the title with May Day, furthering the idea of a confusion of time and the seasons. This is evidenced by Theseus commenting on some slumbering youths, that they \"observe The rite of May\".\nLoss of individual identity.\nMaurice Hunt, former Chair of the English Department at Baylor University, writes of the blurring of the identities of fantasy and reality in the play that make possible \"that pleasing, narcotic dreaminess associated with the fairies of the play\". By emphasising this theme, even in the setting of the play, Shakespeare prepares the reader's mind to accept the fantastic reality of the fairy world and its happenings. This also seems to be the axis around which the plot conflicts in the play occur. Hunt suggests that it is the breaking down of individual identities that leads to the central conflict in the story. It is the brawl between Oberon and Titania, based on a lack of recognition for the other in the relationship, that drives the rest of the drama in the story and makes it dangerous for any of the other lovers to come together due to the disturbance of Nature caused by a fairy dispute. Similarly, this failure to identify and to distinguish is what leads Puck to mistake one set of lovers for another in the forest, placing the flower's juice on Lysander's eyes instead of Demetrius'.\nVictor Kiernan, a Marxist scholar and historian, writes that it is for the greater sake of love that this loss of identity takes place and that individual characters are made to suffer accordingly: \"It was the more extravagant cult of love that struck sensible people as irrational, and likely to have dubious effects on its acolytes.\" He believes that identities in the play are not so much lost as they are blended together to create a type of haze through which distinction becomes nearly impossible. It is driven by a desire for new and more practical ties between characters as a means of coping with the strange world within the forest, even in relationships as diverse and seemingly unrealistic as the brief love between Titania and Bottom: \"It was the tidal force of this social need that lent energy to relationships.\"\nThe aesthetics scholar David Marshall draws out this theme even further by noting that the loss of identity reaches its fullness in the description of the mechanicals and their assumption of other identities. In describing the occupations of the acting troupe, he writes \"Two construct or put together, two mend and repair, one weaves and one sews. All join together what is apart or mend what has been rent, broken, or sundered.\" In Marshall's opinion, this loss of individual identity not only blurs specificities, it creates new identities found in community, which Marshall points out may lead to some understanding of Shakespeare's opinions on love and marriage. Further, the mechanicals understand this theme as they take on their individual parts for a corporate performance of Pyramus and Thisbe. Marshall remarks that \"To be an actor is to double and divide oneself, to discover oneself in two parts: both oneself and not oneself, both the part and not the part.\" He claims that the mechanicals understand this and that each character, particularly among the lovers, has a sense of laying down individual identity for the greater benefit of the group or pairing. It seems that a desire to lose one's individuality and find identity in the love of another is what quietly moves the events of \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\". As the primary sense of motivation, this desire is reflected even in the scenery depictions and the story's overall mood.\nAmbiguous sexuality.\nIn his essay \"Preposterous Pleasures: Queer Theories and \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\",\" Douglas E. Green explores possible interpretations of alternative sexuality that he finds within the text of the play, in juxtaposition to the proscribed social mores of the culture at the time the play was written. He writes that his essay \"does not (seek to) rewrite \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" as a gay play but rather explores some of its 'homoerotic significations'\u00a0... moments of 'queer' disruption and eruption in this Shakespearean comedy.\"\nGreen does not consider Shakespeare to have been a \"sexual radical\", but that the play represented a \"topsy-turvy world\" or \"temporary holiday\" that mediates or negotiates the \"discontents of civilisation\", which while resolved neatly in the story's conclusion, do not resolve so neatly in real life. Green writes that the \"sodomitical elements\", \"homoeroticism\", \"lesbianism\", and even \"compulsory heterosexuality\"\u2014the first hint of which may be Oberon's obsession with Titania's changeling ward\u2014in the story must be considered in the context of the \"culture of early modern England\" as a commentary on the \"aesthetic rigidities of comic form and political ideologies of the prevailing order\".\nGender roles.\nMale dominance is one thematic element found in the play. In \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", Lysander and Hermia escape into the woods for a night where they do not fall under the laws of Theseus or Egeus. Upon their arrival in Athens, the couples are married. Marriage is seen as the ultimate social achievement for women while men can go on to do many other great things and gain social recognition. In \"The Imperial Votaress\", Louis Montrose draws attention to male and female gender roles and norms present in the comedy in connection with Elizabethan culture. In reference to the triple wedding, he says, \"The festive conclusion in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" depends upon the success of a process by which the feminine pride and power manifested in Amazon warriors, possessive mothers, unruly wives, and wilful daughters are brought under the control of lords and husbands.\" He says that the consummation of marriage is how power over a woman changes hands from father to husband. A connection is drawn between flowers and sexuality. Montrose sees the juice employed by Oberon as symbolising menstrual blood as well as the \"sexual blood shed by 'virgins'\". While blood as a result of menstruation is representative of a woman's power, blood as a result of a first sexual encounter represents man's power over women.\nThere are points in the play, however, when there is an absence of patriarchal control. In his book \"Power on Display\", Leonard Tennenhouse says the problem in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" is the problem of \"authority gone archaic\". The Athenian law requiring a daughter to die if she does not do her father's will is outdated. Tennenhouse contrasts the patriarchal rule of Theseus in Athens with that of Oberon in the carnivalistic Faerie world. The disorder in the land of the fairies completely opposes the world of Athens. He states that during times of carnival and festival, male power is broken down. For example, what happens to the four lovers in the woods as well as Bottom's dream represents chaos that contrasts with Theseus' political order. However, Theseus does not punish the lovers for their disobedience. According to Tennenhouse, by forgiving the lovers, he has made a distinction between the law of the patriarch (Egeus) and that of the monarch (Theseus), creating two different voices of authority. This can be compared to the time of Elizabeth I, in which monarchs were seen as having two bodies: the body natural and the body politic. Tennenhouse says that Elizabeth's succession itself represented both the voice of a patriarch and the voice of a monarch: (1) her father's will, which stated that the crown should pass to her and (2) the fact that she was the daughter of a king.\nCriticism.\nCritical history.\n17th century.\nDorothea Kehler has attempted to trace the criticism of the work through the centuries. The earliest such piece of criticism that she found was a 1662 entry in the diary of Samuel Pepys. He found the play to be \"the most insipid ridiculous play that ever I saw in my life\". He did, however, admit that it had \"some good dancing and some handsome women, which was all my pleasure\".\nThe next critic known to comment on the play was John Dryden, writing \"The Authors Apology for Heroique Poetry; and Poetique Licence\" in 1677. He was preoccupied with the question of whether fairies should be depicted in theatrical plays, since they did not exist. He concluded that poets should be allowed to depict things which do not exist but derive from popular belief. And fairies are of this sort, as are pygmies and the extraordinary effects of magic. Based on this reasoning, Dryden defended the merits of three fantasy plays: \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", \"The Tempest\", and Ben Jonson's \"The Masque of Queens\".\n18th century.\nCharles Gildon in the early 18th century recommended this play for its beautiful reflections, descriptions, similes, and topics. Gildon thought that Shakespeare drew inspiration from the works of Ovid and Virgil, and that he could read them in the original Latin and not in later translations.\nWilliam Duff, writing in the 1770s, also recommended this play. He felt the depiction of the supernatural was among Shakespeare's strengths, not weaknesses. He especially praised the poetry and wit of the fairies, and the quality of the verse involved. His contemporary Francis Gentleman, an admirer of Shakespeare, was much less appreciative of this play. He felt that the poetry, the characterisation, and the originality of the play were its strengths, but that its major weaknesses were a \"puerile\" plot and that it consists of an odd mixture of incidents. The connection of the incidents to each other seemed rather forced to Gentleman.\nEdmond Malone, a Shakespearean scholar and critic of the late 18th century, found another supposed flaw in this particular play, its lack of a proper decorum. He found that the \"more exalted characters\" (the aristocrats of Athens) are subservient to the interests of those beneath them. In other words, the lower-class characters play larger roles than their betters and overshadow them. He found this to be a grave error of the writer. Malone thought that this play had to be an early and immature work of Shakespeare and, by implication, that an older writer would know better. Malone's main argument seems to derive from the classism of his era. He assumes that the aristocrats had to receive more attention in the narrative and to be more important, more distinguished, and better than the lower class.\n19th century.\nAccording to Kehler, significant 19th-century criticism began in 1808 with August Wilhelm Schlegel. Schlegel perceived unity in the multiple plot lines. He noted that the donkey's head is not a random transformation, but reflects Bottom's true nature. He identified the tale of Pyramus and Thisbe as a burlesque of the Athenian lovers. In 1817, William Hazlitt found the play to be better as a written work than a staged production. He found the work to be \"a delightful fiction\" but when staged, it is reduced to a dull pantomime. He concluded that poetry and the stage do not fit together. Kehler finds the comment to be more of an indication of the quality of the theatrical productions available to Hazlitt, rather than a true indication of the play's supposed unsuitability to the stage. She notes that prior to the 1840s, all stage productions of this play were adaptations unfaithful to the original text.\nIn 1811\u20131812, Samuel Taylor Coleridge made two points of criticism about this play. The first was that the entire play should be seen as a dream. Second, that Helena is guilty of \"ungrateful treachery\" to Hermia. He thought that this was a reflection of the lack of principles in women, who are more likely to follow their own passions and inclinations than men. Women, in his view, feel less abhorrence for moral evil, though they are concerned with its outward consequences. Coleridge was probably the earliest critic to introduce gender issues to the analysis of this play. Kehler dismisses his views on Helena as indications of Coleridge's own misogyny, rather than genuine reflections of Helena's morality.\nIn 1837, William Maginn produced essays on the play. He turned his attention to Theseus' speech about \"the lunatic, the lover, and the poet\" and to Hippolyta's response to it. He regarded Theseus as the voice of Shakespeare himself and the speech as a call for imaginative audiences. He also viewed Bottom as a lucky man on whom Fortune showered favours beyond measure. He was particularly amused by the way Bottom reacts to the love of the fairy queen: completely unfazed. Maginn argued that \"Theseus would have bent in reverent awe before Titania. Bottom treats her as carelessly as if she were the wench of the next-door tapster.\" Finally, Maginn thought that Oberon should not be blamed for Titania's chagrin, which is the result of an accident. He viewed Oberon as angry with the \"caprices\" of his queen, but unable to anticipate that her charmed affections would be reserved for a weaver with a donkey's head.\nIn 1839, the philosopher Hermann Ulrici wrote that the play and its depiction of human life reflected the views of Platonism. In his view, Shakespeare implied that human life is nothing but a dream, suggesting influence from Plato and his followers who thought human reality is deprived of all genuine existence. Ulrici noted the way Theseus and Hippolyta behave here, like ordinary people. He agreed with Malone that this did not fit their stations in life, but viewed this behaviour as an indication of parody about class differences.\nJames Halliwell-Phillipps, writing in the 1840s, found that there were many inconsistencies in the play, but considered it the most beautiful poetical drama ever written.\nIn 1849, Charles Knight also wrote about the play and its apparent lack of proper social stratification. He thought that this play indicated Shakespeare's maturity as a playwright, and that its \"Thesean harmony\" reflects proper decorum of character. He also viewed Bottom as the best-drawn character, with his self-confidence, authority, and self-love. He argued that Bottom stands as a representative of the whole human race. Like Hazlitt he felt that the work is best appreciated when read as a text, rather than acted on stage. He found the writing to be \"subtle and ethereal\", and standing above literary criticism and its reductive reasoning.\nAlso in 1849, Georg Gottfried Gervinus wrote extensively about the play. He denied the theory that this play should be seen as a dream. He argued that it should be seen as an ethical construct and an allegory. He thought that it was an allegorical depiction of the errors of sensual love, which is likened to a dream. In his view, Hermia lacks in filial obedience and acts as if devoid of conscience when she runs away with Lysander. Lysander is also guilty for disobeying and mocking his prospective father-in-law. Pyramus and Thisbe also lack in filial obedience, since they \"woo by moonlight\" behind their parents' backs. The fairies, in his view, should be seen as \"personified dream gods\". They represent the caprices of superficial love, and they lack in intellect, feeling, and ethics.\nGervinus also wrote on where the fairyland of the play is located. Not in Attica, but in the Indies. His views on the Indies seem to Kehler to be influenced by Orientalism. He speaks of the Indies as scented with the aroma of flowers, and as the place where mortals live in the state of a half-dream. Gervinus denies and devalues the loyalty of Titania to her friend. He views this supposed friendship as not grounded in spiritual association. Titania merely \"delight[s] in her beauty, her 'swimming gait,' and her powers of imitation\". Gervinus further views Titania as an immoral character for not trying to reconcile with her husband. In her resentment, Titania seeks separation from him, for which Gervinus blames her.\nGervinus wrote with elitist disdain about the mechanicals of the play and their acting aspirations. He described them as homely creatures with \"hard hands and thick heads\". They are, in his view, ignorant men who compose and act in plays merely for financial reward. They are not real artists. Gervinus reserves his praise and respect only for Theseus, who he thinks represents the intellectual man. Like several of his predecessors, Gervinus thought that this work should be read as a text and not acted on stage.\nIn 1863, Charles Cowden Clarke also wrote on this play. Kehler notes he was the husband of famous Shakespearean scholar Mary Cowden Clarke. Charles was more appreciative of the lower-class mechanicals of the play. He commented favourably on their individualisation and their collective richness of character. He thought that Bottom was conceited but good natured, and shows a considerable store of imagination in his interaction with the representatives of the fairy world. He also argued that Bottom's conceit was a quality inseparable from his secondary profession, that of an actor.\nIn 1872, Henry N. Hudson, an American clergyman and editor of Shakespeare, also wrote comments on this play. Kehler pays little attention to his writings, as they were largely derivative of previous works. She notes, however, that Hudson too believed that the play should be viewed as a dream. He cited the lightness of the characterisation as supporting of his view. In 1881, Edward Dowden argued that Theseus and his reflections on art are central to the play. He also argued that Theseus was one of the \"heroic men of action\" so central to Shakespeare's theatrical works.\nBoth Horace Howard Furness and Henry Austin Clapp were more concerned with the problem of the play's duration, though they held opposing views. Clapp, writing in 1885, commented on the inconsistency of the time depicted in the play, as it should take place in four days and nights and seems to last less than two, and felt that this added to the unrealistic quality of the play. Furness, defending the play in 1895, felt that the apparent inconsistency did not detract from the play's quality.\nIn 1887, Denton Jacques Snider argued that the play should be read as a dialectic, either between understanding and imagination or between prose and poetry. He also viewed the play as representing three phases or movements. The first is the Real World of the play, which represents reason. The second is the Fairy World, an ideal world which represents imagination and the supernatural. The third is their representation in art, where the action is self-reflective. Snider viewed Titania and her caprice as solely to blame for her marital strife with Oberon. She therefore deserves punishment, and Oberon is a dutiful husband who provides her with one. For failing to live in peace with Oberon and her kind, Titania is sentenced to fall in love with a human. And this human, unlike Oberon is a \"horrid brute\".\nTowards the end of the 19th century, Georg Brandes (1895\u20136) and Frederick S. Boas (1896) were the last major additions to \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" criticism. Brandes' approach anticipates later psychological readings, seeing Oberon's magic as symbolic and \"typifying the sorcery of the erotic imagination\". Brandes felt that in the play, Shakespeare looks inward at the \"domain of the unconscious\". Boas eschews the play as ethical treatise or psychological study and instead takes a more historicist and literal approach. To Boas the play is, despite its fantastical and exotic trappings, \"essentially English and Elizabethan\". He sees Theseus as a Tudor noble; Helena a mere plot device to \"concentrate the four lovers on a single spot\"; and the \"Pyramus and Thisbe\" play-within-the-play a parody of a prominent \"topos\" of contemporary plays. Summing up their contributions, Kehler writes: \"This is recognizably modern criticism.\"\n20th century.\nThe 20th century brought new insights into the play. In 1961, Elizabeth Sewell argued that Shakespeare aligns himself not with the aristocrats of the play, but with Bottom and the artisans. It is their task to produce a wedding entertainment, precisely the purpose of the writer on working in this play. Also in 1961, Frank Kermode wrote on the themes of the play and their literary sources. He counted among them fantasy, blind love, and divine love. He traced these themes to the works of Macrobius, Apuleius, and Giordano Bruno. Bottom also briefly alludes to a passage from the First Epistle to the Corinthians by Paul the Apostle, dealing with divine love.\nIn 1964, R.W. Dent argued against theories that the exemplary model of love in the play is the rational love of Theseus and Hippolyta. He argued that in this work, love is inexplicable. It is the offspring of imagination, not reason. However the exemplary love of the play is one of an imagination controlled and restrained, and avoids the excesses of \"dotage\". Genuine love is contrasted with the unrequited love (and dotage) of Demetrius for Hermia, and with the supposed love (and dotage) of Titania for an unworthy object.\nDent also denied the rationality and wisdom typically attributed to Theseus. He reminded his readers that this is the character of Theseus from Greek mythology, a creation himself of \"antique fable\". Theseus' views on art are far from rational or wise. He cannot tell the difference between an actual play and its interlude. The interlude of the play's acting troop is less about the art and more of an expression of the mechanicals' distrust of their own audience. They fear the audience reactions will be either excessive or inadequate, and say so on stage. Theseus fails to get the message.\nAlso in 1964, Jan Kott offered his own views on the play. He saw the main themes of the play as being violence and \"unrepressed animalistic sexuality\". Both Lysander and Demetrius are, in his view, verbally brutal lovers, whose love interests are exchangeable and objectified. The changeling that Oberon desires is his new \"sexual toy\". The aristocrats of the play, both mortal and immortal, are promiscuous. As for the Athenian lovers following their night in the forest, they are ashamed to talk about it because that night liberated them from themselves and social norms, and allowed them to reveal their real selves. Kott's views were controversial, and contemporary critics wrote either in favour of or against his ideas, but few ignored them.\nIn 1967, John A. Allen theorised that Bottom is a symbol of the animalistic aspect of humanity. He also thought Bottom was redeemed through the maternal tenderness of Titania, which allowed him to understand the love and self-sacrifice of Pyramus and Thisbe. In 1968, Stephen Fender offered his own views on the play. He emphasised the \"terrifying power\" of the fairies and argued that they control the play's events. They are the most powerful figures featured, not Theseus as often thought. He also emphasised the ethically ambivalent characters of the play. Finally, Fender noted a layer of complexity in the play. Theseus, Hippolyta, and Bottom have contradictory reactions to the events of the night, and each has partly valid reasons for their reactions, implying that the puzzles offered to the play's audience can have no singular answer or meaning.\nIn 1969, Michael Taylor argued that previous critics offered a too cheerful view of what the play depicts. He emphasised the less pleasant aspects of the otherwise appealing fairies and the nastiness of the mortal Demetrius prior to his enchantment. He argued that the overall themes are the often painful aspects of love and the pettiness of people, which here include the fairies.\nIn 1970, R. A. Zimbardo viewed the play as full of symbols. The Moon and its phases alluded to in the play, in his view, stand for permanence in mutability. The play uses the principle of \"discordia concors\" in several of its key scenes. Theseus and Hippolyta represent marriage and, symbolically, the reconciliation of the natural seasons or the phases of time. Hippolyta's story arc is that she must submit to Theseus and become a matron. Titania has to give up her motherly obsession with the changeling boy and passes through a symbolic death, and Oberon has to once again woo and win his wife. Kehler notes that Zimbardo took for granted the female subordination within the obligatory marriage, social views that were already challenged in the 1960s.\nIn 1971, James L. Calderwood offered a new view on the role of Oberon. He viewed the king as specialising in the arts of illusion. Oberon, in his view, is the interior dramatist of the play, orchestrating events. He is responsible for the play's happy ending, when he influences Theseus to overrule Egeus and allow the lovers to marry. Oberon and Theseus bring harmony out of discord. He also suggested that the lovers' identities, which are blurred and lost in the forest, recall the unstable identities of the actors who constantly change roles. In fact the failure of the artisans' play is based on their chief flaw as actors: they can not lose their own identities to even temporarily replace them with those of their fictional roles.\nAlso in 1971, Andrew D. Weiner argued that the play's actual theme is unity. The poet's imagination creates unity by giving form to diverse elements, and the writer is addressing the spectator's own imagination which also creates and perceives unity. Weiner connected this unity to the concept of uniformity, and in turn viewed this as Shakespeare's allusion to the \"eternal truths\" of Platonism and Christianity.\nAlso writing in 1971, Hugh M. Richmond offered an entirely new view of the play's love story lines. He argued that what passes for love in this play is actually a self-destructive expression of passion. He argued that the play's significant characters are all affected by passion and by a sadomasochistic type of sexuality. This passion prevents the lovers from genuinely communicating with each other. At the same time it protects them from the disenchantment with the love interest that communication inevitably brings. The exception to the rule is Bottom, who is chiefly devoted to himself. His own egotism protects him from feeling passion for anyone else. Richmond also noted that there are parallels between the tale of Pyramus and Thisbe, featured in this play, and that of Shakespeare's \"Romeo and Juliet\".\nIn 1971, Neil Taylor argued that there was a double time-scheme in the play, making it seem to last a minimum of four nights but to also be timeless.\nIn 1972, Ralph Berry argued that Shakespeare was chiefly concerned with epistemology in this play. The lovers declare illusion to be reality, the actors declare reality to be illusion. The play ultimately reconciles the seemingly opposing views and vindicates imagination. Also in 1972, Thomas McFarland argued that the play is dominated by a mood of happiness and that it is one of the happiest literary creations ever produced. The mood is so lovely that the audience never feels fear or worry about the fate of the characters.\nIn 1974, Marjorie Garber argued that metamorphosis is both the major subject of the play and the model of its structure. She noted that in this play, the entry in the woods is a dream-like change in perception, a change which affects both the characters and the audience. Dreams here take priority over reason, and are truer than the reality they seek to interpret and transform. Also in 1974, Alexander Leggatt offered his own reading of the play. He was certain that there are grimmer elements in the play, but they are overlooked because the audience focuses on the story of the sympathetic young lovers. He viewed the characters as separated into four groups which interact in various ways. Among the four, the fairies stand as the most sophisticated and unconstrained. The contrasts between the interacting groups produce the play's comic perspective.\nIn 1975, Ronald F. Miller expresses his view that the play is a study in the epistemology of imagination. He focused on the role of the fairies, who have a mysterious aura of evanescence and ambiguity. Also in 1975, David Bevington offered his own reading of the play. He in part refuted the ideas of Jan Kott concerning the sexuality of Oberon and the fairies. He pointed that Oberon may be bisexual and his desire for the changeling boy may be sexual in nature, as Kott suggested. But there is little textual evidence to support this, as the writer left ambiguous clues concerning the idea of love among the fairies. He concluded that therefore their love life is \"unknowable and incomprehensible\". According to Bevington, the main theme of the play is the conflict between sexual desire and rational restraint, an essential tension reflected throughout the play. It is the tension between the dark and benevolent sides of love, which are reconciled in the end.\nIn 1977, Anne Paolucci argued that the play lasts five days.\nIn 1979, M. E. Lamb suggested that the play may have borrowed an aspect of the ancient myth of Theseus: the Athenian's entry into the Labyrinth of the Minotaur. The woods of the play serve as a metaphorical labyrinth, and for Elizabethans the woods were often an allegory of sexual sin. The lovers in the woods conquer irrational passion and find their way back. Bottom with his animal head becomes a comical version of the Minotaur. Bottom also becomes Ariadne's thread which guides the lovers. In having the new Minotaur rescue rather than threaten the lovers, the classical myth is comically inverted. Theseus himself is the bridegroom of the play who has left the labyrinth and promiscuity behind, having conquered his passion. The artisans may stand in for the master craftsman of the myth, and builder of the Labyrinth, Daedalus. Even Theseus' best known speech in the play, which connects the poet with the lunatic and the lover may be another metaphor of the lover. It is a challenge for the poet to confront the irrationality he shares with lovers and lunatics, accepting the risks of entering the labyrinth.\nAlso in 1979, Harold F. Brooks agreed that the main theme of the play, its very heart, is desire and its culmination in marriage. All other subjects are of lesser importance, including that of imagination and that of appearance and reality. In 1980, Florence Falk offered a view of the play based on theories of cultural anthropology. She argued that the play is about traditional rites of passage, which trigger development within the individual and society. Theseus has detached himself from imagination and rules Athens harshly. The lovers flee from the structure of his society to the \"communitas\" of the woods. The woods serve here as the \"communitas\", a temporary aggregate for persons whose asocial desires require accommodation to preserve the health of society. This is the rite of passage where the asocial can be contained. Falk identified this \"communitas\" with the woods, with the unconscious, with the dream space. She argued that the lovers experience release into self-knowledge and then return to the renewed Athens. This is \"societas\", the resolution of the dialectic between the dualism of \"communitas\" and structure.\nAlso in 1980, Christian critic R. Chris Hassel, Jr. offered a Christian view of the play. The experience of the lovers and that of Bottom (as expressed in his awakening speech) teach them \"a new humility, a healthy sense of folly\". They realise that there are things that are true despite the fact that they can not be seen or understood. They just learned a lesson of faith. Hassel also thought that Theseus' speech on the lunatic, the lover, and the poet is an applause to imagination. But it is also a laughing rejection of futile attempts to perceive, categorise, or express it.\nSome of the interpretations of the play have been based on psychology and its diverse theories. In 1972, Alex Aronson argued that Theseus represents the conscious mind and Puck represents the unconscious mind. Puck, in this view, is a guise of the unconscious as a trickster, while remaining subservient to Oberon. Aronson thought that the play explores unauthorised desire and linked it to the concept of fertility. He viewed the donkey and the trees as fertility symbols. The lovers' sexual desires are symbolised in their forest encounters. In 1973, Melvin Goldstein argued that the lovers can not simply return to Athens and wed. First, they have to pass through stages of madness (multiple disguises), and discover their \"authentic sexual selves\". In 1979, Norman N. Holland applied psychoanalytic literary criticism to the play. He interpreted the dream of Hermia as if it was a real dream. In his view, the dream uncovers the phases of Hermia's sexual development. Her search for options is her defence mechanism. She both desires Lysander and wants to retain her virginity.\nIn 1981, Mordecai Marcus argued for a new meaning of Eros (Love) and Thanatos (Death) in this play. In his view, Shakespeare suggests that love requires the risk of death. Love achieves force and direction from the interweaving of the life impulse with the deathward-release of sexual tension. He also viewed the play as suggesting that the healing force of love is connected to the acceptance of death, and vice versa.\nIn 1987, Jan Lawson Hinely argued that this play has a therapeutic value. Shakespeare in many ways explores the sexual fears of the characters, releases them, and transforms them. And the happy ending is the reestablishment of social harmony. Patriarchy itself is also challenged and transformed, as the men offer their women a loving equality, one founded on respect and trust. She even viewed Titania's loving acceptance of the donkey-headed Bottom as a metaphor for basic trust. This trust is what enables the warring and uncertain lovers to achieve their sexual maturity. In 1988, Allen Dunn argued that the play is an exploration of the characters' fears and desires, and that its structure is based on a series of sexual clashes.\nIn 1991, Barbara Freedman argued that the play justifies the ideological formation of absolute monarchy, and makes visible for examination the maintenance process of hegemonic order.\nPerformance history.\n17th and 18th centuries.\nDuring the years of the Puritan Interregnum when the theatres were closed (1642\u20131660), the comic subplot of Bottom and his compatriots was performed as a droll. Drolls were comical playlets, often adapted from the subplots of Shakespearean and other plays, that could be attached to the acts of acrobats and jugglers and other allowed performances, thus circumventing the ban against drama. When the theatres re-opened in 1660, \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" was acted in adapted form, like many other Shakespearean plays. Samuel Pepys saw it on 29 September 1662 and thought it \"the most insipid, ridiculous play that ever I saw\u00a0...\"\nAfter the Jacobean / Caroline era, \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" was never performed in its entirety until the 1840s. Instead, it was heavily adapted in forms like Henry Purcell's musical masque/play \"The Fairy Queen\" (1692), which had a successful run at the Dorset Garden Theatre, but was not revived. Richard Leveridge turned the Pyramus and Thisbe scenes into an Italian opera burlesque, acted at Lincoln's Inn Fields in 1716. John Frederick Lampe elaborated upon Leveridge's version in 1745. Charles Johnson had used the Pyramus and Thisbe material in the finale of \"Love in a Forest\", his 1723 adaptation of \"As You Like It\". In 1755, David Garrick did the opposite of what had been done a century earlier: he extracted Bottom and his companions and acted the rest, in an adaptation called \"The Fairies.\" Frederic Reynolds produced an operatic version in 1816.\nThe Victorian stage.\nIn 1840, Madame Vestris at Covent Garden returned the play to the stage with a relatively full text, adding musical sequences and balletic dances. Vestris took the role of Oberon, and for the next seventy years, Oberon and Puck would always be played by women.\nAfter the success of Madame Vestris' production, 19th-century theatre continued to stage the \"Dream\" as a spectacle, often with a cast numbering nearly one hundred. Detailed sets were created for the palace and the forest, and the fairies were portrayed as gossamer-winged ballerinas. The overture by Felix Mendelssohn was always used throughout this period. Augustin Daly's production opened in 1895 in London and ran for 21 performances.\n20th and 21st centuries.\nIn 1905 Oscar Asche staged a production at the Adelphi Theatre in London with himself as Bottom and Beatrice Ferrar as Puck.\nHerbert Beerbohm Tree staged a 1911 production which featured \"mechanical birds twittering in beech trees, a simulated stream, fairies wearing battery-operated lighting, and live rabbits following trails of food across the stage.\"\nMax Reinhardt staged \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" thirteen times between 1905 and 1934, introducing a revolving set. After he fled Germany he devised a more spectacular outdoor version at the Hollywood Bowl in September 1934. The shell was removed and replaced by a forest planted in tons of dirt hauled in especially for the event, and a trestle was constructed from the hills to the stage. The wedding procession inserted between Acts\u00a0IV and V crossed the trestle with torches down the hillside. The cast included James Cagney, Olivia de Havilland, Mickey Rooney, Victor Jory, and a corps of dancers that included Butterfly McQueen. The play was accompanied by Mendelssohn's music.\nOn the strength of this production, Warner Brothers signed Reinhardt to direct a filmed version, Hollywood's first Shakespeare movie since Douglas Fairbanks Sr. and Mary Pickford's \"Taming of the Shrew\" in 1929. Jory (Oberon), Rooney (Puck) and De Havilland (Hermia) reprised their roles from the Hollywood Bowl cast. James Cagney starred, in his only Shakespearean role, as Bottom. Other actors in the film who played Shakespearean roles just this once included Joe E. Brown and Dick Powell. Erich Wolfgang Korngold was brought from Austria to arrange Mendelssohn's music for the film. He used not only the \"Midsummer Night's Dream\" music but also several other pieces by Mendelssohn. Korngold went on to make a legendary career in Hollywood, remaining in the United States after Nazi Germany annexed Austria.\nDirector Harley Granville-Barker introduced in 1914 a less spectacular way of staging the \"Dream\": he reduced the size of the cast and used Elizabethan folk music instead of Mendelssohn. He replaced large, complex sets with a simple system of patterned curtains. He portrayed the fairies as golden robotic insectoid creatures based on Cambodian idols. His simpler, sparer staging significantly influenced subsequent productions.\nIn 1970, Peter Brook staged the play for the Royal Shakespeare Company in a blank white box, in which masculine fairies engaged in circus tricks such as trapeze artistry. Brook also introduced the subsequently common notion of doubling Theseus/Oberon and Hippolyta/Titania, as if to suggest that the world of the fairies is a mirror version of the world of the mortals. British actors who played roles in Brook's production included Patrick Stewart, Ben Kingsley, John Kane (Puck) and Frances de la Tour (Helena). Recordings documenting this production survive.\n\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" has been produced many times in New York, including a production by the Theatre for a New Audience, produced by Joseph Papp at the Public Theater, and also several stagings by the New York Shakespeare Festival at the Delacorte Theatre in Central Park. In 1978, the Riverside Shakespeare Company staged an outdoor production starring Eric Hoffmann as Puck, with Karen Hurley as Titania and Eric Conger as Oberon, directed by company founder Gloria Skurski. There have been several variations since then, including some set in the 1980s.\nThe Maryland Shakespeare Players at University of Maryland staged a queer production in 2015 in which the lovers were same-sex couples and the mechanicals were drag queens.\nThe University of Michigan's Nichols Arboretum's programme Shakespeare in the Arb has presented a play every summer since 2001. Shakespeare in the Arb has produced \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" three times. These performances take place in a natural setting, with lush woods, a flowing river, and steep hills. The performance takes place in several places, with actors and audience moving together to each setting. \"As one critic commented, 'The actors used the vastness of its Arb[oretum] stage to full advantage, making entrances from behind trees, appearing over rises and vanishing into the woods.'\"\nArtistic director Emma Rice's first production at Shakespeare's Globe in 2016 was a version of the play. While not \"a production to please the purists\", it received praise. A contemporary reworking, it included gender-switched characters and Bollywood influences.\nAdaptations and cultural references.\nPlays.\n\"Absurda Comica, oder Herr Peter Squentz\" by Andreas Gryphius, which was probably written between 1648 and 1650 and was published in 1657, is evidently based on the comic episode of Pyramus and Thisbe in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\".\nKen Ludwig's 2003 comic play, \"Shakespeare in Hollywood\", is set during the production of the 1935 film. Oberon and Puck appear on the scene, and find themselves cast as themselves.\nLiterary.\nKarl Marx quotes from the play in the first volume of his magnum opus \"Das Kapital\".\nThe play was translated into Esperanto (constructed international auxiliary language) by Louise Briggs in 1920.\nW. Stanley Moss used the quotation \"Ill met by moonlight\" as the title of his \"Ill Met by Moonlight\" (1950), a non-fiction book about the kidnap of General Kreipe during WWII. The book was adapted into a film with the same name in 1957.\nBotho Strau\u00df's play \"The Park\" (1983) is based on characters and motifs from \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\".\nNeil Gaiman's comic series \"The Sandman\" uses the play in the 1990 issue \"\". In this story, Shakespeare and his company perform the play for the real Oberon and Titania and an audience of fairies. The play is heavily quoted in the comic, and Shakespeare's son Hamnet appears in the play as the Indian boy. This issue was the first and only comic to win the World Fantasy Award for Best Short Fiction, in 1991.\nTerry Pratchett's book \"Lords and Ladies\" (1992) is a parody of the play.\nBernard Cornwell's novel \"Fools and Mortals\" (2017) is about the creation and first performance of the play, as seen by the young actor, Richard Shakespeare, brother of the playwright.\nMusical versions.\n\"The Fairy-Queen\" is an opera from 1692 by Henry Purcell, based on the play.\nIn 1826, Felix Mendelssohn composed a concert overture, inspired by the play, that was first performed in 1827. In 1842, partly because of the fame of the overture, and partly because his employer King Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia liked the incidental music that Mendelssohn had written for other plays that had been staged at the palace in German translation, Mendelssohn was commissioned to write incidental music for a production of \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" that was to be staged in 1843 in Potsdam. He incorporated the existing Overture into the incidental music, which was used in most stage versions through the 19th century. The best known of the pieces from the incidental music is the famous \"Wedding March\", frequently used as a recessional in weddings.\nBetween 1917 and 1939 Carl Orff also wrote incidental music for a German version of the play, \"Ein Sommernachtstraum\" (performed in 1939). Given that Mendelssohn's parents had been Jews (and despite the fact that they converted to Lutheranism), his music had been banned by the Nazi regime, and the Nazi cultural officials put out a call for new music for the play: Orff was one of the musicians who responded. He later reworked the music for a final version, completed in 1964.\nIn 1949, a three-act opera by Marcel Delannoy entitled \"Puck\" was premiered in Strasbourg.\n\"Over Hill, Over Dale\", from Act 2, is the third of the \"Three Shakespeare Songs\" set to music by the British composer Ralph Vaughan Williams. He wrote the pieces for a cappella SATB choir in 1951 for the British Federation of Music Festivals, and they remain a popular part of British choral repertoire today.\nThe play was adapted into an opera, with music by Benjamin Britten and libretto by Britten and Peter Pears. This was first performed on 11 June 1960 at Aldeburgh.\nIn 1964, a musical adaptation debuted on Broadway as \"Babes in The Wood\".\nProgressive rock guitarist Steve Hackett, best known for his work with Genesis, made a classical adaptation of the play in 1997. Hans Werner Henze's Eighth Symphony, written in 1993, is also inspired by sequences from the play.\nThe theatre company Moonwork put on a production of \"Midsummer\" in 1999. It was conceived by Mason Pettit, Gregory Sherman and Gregory Wolfe (who directed it). The show featured a rock-opera version of the play within a play, Pyramus &amp; Thisbe, with music written by Rusty Magee. The music for the rest of the show was written by Andrew Sherman.\n\"The Donkey Show\" is a disco-era experience based on \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", that first appeared off Broadway in 1999.\nIn 2011, Opera Memphis, Playhouse on the Square, and contemporary a cappella groups DeltaCappella and Riva, premiered Michael Ching's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream: Opera A Cappella\".\nIn 2015, the plot of \"Be More Chill\" included a version of the play called \"A Midsummer Nightmare (About Zombies)\".\nFilm adaptations.\n\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" has been adapted as a film many times.

{"id": "43207", "revid": "38411991", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43207", "title": "Polychaete", "text": "Class of annelid worms\nPolychaeta () is a paraphyletic class of generally marine annelid worms, commonly called bristle worms or polychaetes (). Each body segment has a pair of fleshy protrusions called parapodia which bear many chitinous bristles called chaetae, hence their name.\nMore than 10,000 species have been described in this diverse and widespread class; in addition to inhabiting all of the world's oceans, polychaetes occur at all ocean depths, from planktonic species living near the surface, to a small undescribed species observed through ROV at the deepest region in the Earth's oceans, Challenger Deep. In addition, many species live on the abyssal plains, coral reefs, parasitically, and a few within fresh water.\nCommonly encountered representatives include the lugworms, bloodworms, and species of \"Alitta\" such as the clam worm and sandworm or ragworm; these species inhabit shallow water marine environments and coastlines of subtropical and temperate regions around the world and may be used as fishing bait. More exotic species include the stinging fireworms, the predatory and large-bodied bobbit worm, the culturally important palolo worm, the bone-eating worms, and giant tube worms, which are extremophiles that tolerate near-boiling water near hydrothermal vents.\nDescription.\nPolychaetes are segmented worms, generally less than in length, although ranging at the extremes from to , in \"Eunice aphroditois\". They can sometimes be brightly coloured, and may be iridescent or even luminescent. Each segment bears a pair of paddle-like and highly vascularized parapodia, which are used for movement and, in many species, act as the worm's primary respiratory surfaces. Bundles of bristles, the chaetae, project from the parapodia.\nHowever, polychaete body plans vary widely from this generalized pattern, and can display a range of different body forms. The most generalised polychaetes are those that crawl along the bottom, but others have adapted to many different ecological niches, including burrowing, pelagic swimming, dwelling in self-created tubes or ones bored out of a substrate, commensalism, and parasitism; such varied lifestyles requires a divergence from the basic body plan of the common ancestor.\nThe head, or prostomium, is relatively well developed, compared with other annelids. It projects forward over the mouth, which is located on the succeeding section; the peristomium. The mouthparts vary in form depending on their diets, since the group includes predators, herbivores, filter feeders, scavengers, and parasites. In general, however, they possess a pair of jaws and a pharynx that can be rapidly everted, allowing the worms to grab food and pull it into their mouths. In some species, the pharynx is modified into a lengthy proboscis. Their jaws are formed from sclerotised collagen. The digestive tract is a simple tube, usually with a stomach partway along.\nThe head may include two to four pairs of eyes, although some species are eyeless. The eyes are typically fairly simple structures, capable of distinguishing only light and dark, although some species have large eyes with lenses that may be capable of more sophisticated vision, an example being the complex eyes of Alciopidae, which rival those of cephalopods and vertebrates. The head also includes a pair of antennae, tentacle-like palps, and a pair of pits lined with cilia known as nuchal organs, which are chemoreceptors that help the worm to seek out food.\nThe outer surface of the body wall consists of a simple columnar epithelium covered by a thin cuticle, constructed from cross-linked collagen fibers and may be thick. Sclerotized collagen makes up their setae.\nUnderneath the cuticle, in order, are a thin layer of connective tissue, a layer of circular muscle, a layer of longitudinal muscle, and a peritoneum surrounding the coelom (body cavity). Additional oblique muscles move the parapodia. In most species the body cavity is divided into separate compartments by sheets of peritoneum between each segment, but in some species it is more continuous.\nPhysiology.\nA simple but well-developed circulatory system is usually present. The two main blood vessels furnish smaller vessels to supply the parapodia and the gut. Blood flows forward in the dorsal vessel, above the gut, and returns down the body in the ventral vessel, beneath the gut. The blood vessels themselves are contractile, helping to push the blood along, so most species have no need of a heart. In a few cases, however, muscular pumps analogous to a heart are found in various parts of the system. Conversely, some species have little or no circulatory system at all, transporting oxygen in the coelomic fluid that fills their body cavities. The blood may be colourless, or have any of three different respiratory pigments. The most common of these is haemoglobin, but some groups have haemerythrin or the green-coloured chlorocruorin, instead.\nThe smallest species, and those adapted to burrowing, lack gills, breathing only through their body surfaces (by diffusion). Most other species have external gills, often associated with the parapodia.\nThe nervous system consists of a single or double ventral nerve cord running the length of the body, with ganglia and a series of small nerves in each segment. The brain is relatively large, compared with that of other annelids, and lies in the upper part of the head. An endocrine gland is attached to the ventral posterior surface of the brain, and appears to be involved in reproductive activity. In addition to the sensory organs on the head, photosensitive eye spots, statocysts, and numerous additional sensory nerve endings, most likely involved with the sense of touch, also occur on the body.\nPolychaetes have a varying number of protonephridia or metanephridia for excreting waste, which in some cases can be relatively complex in structure. The body also contains greenish \"chloragogen\" tissue, similar to that found in oligochaetes, which appears to function in metabolism, in a similar fashion to that of the vertebrate liver.\nMany species exhibit bioluminescence; eight families have luminous species.\nEcology.\nPolychaetes are predominantly marine, but 168 species (nearing 2% of total species) also live in freshwater, and a few in semiterrestrial environments and even in caves. They are extremely variable in both form and lifestyle, and include a few taxa that swim among the plankton or above the abyssal plain. Most burrow or build tubes in the sediment, and some live as commensals. A few species, roughly 80 (less than 0.5% of species), are parasitic. These include both ectoparasites and endoparasites. Ectoparasitic polychaetes feed on skin, blood, and other secretions, and some are adapted to bore through hard, usually calcerous surfaces, such as the shells of mollusks. These \"boring\" polychaetes may be parasitic, but may be opportunistic or even obligate symbionts (commensals).\nThe mobile forms (Errantia) tend to have well-developed sense organs and jaws, while the stationary forms (Sedentaria) lack them, but may have specialized gills or tentacles used for respiration and deposit or filter feeding, e.g., fanworms. Polychaete mouthparts are eversible and used to capture prey. A few groups have evolved to live in terrestrial environments, like Namanereidinae with many terrestrial species, but are restricted to humid areas. Some have even evolved cutaneous invaginations for aerial gas exchange.\nReproduction.\nMost polychaetes have separate sexes, rather than being hermaphroditic. The most primitive species have a pair of gonads in every segment, but most species exhibit some degree of specialisation. The gonads shed immature gametes directly into the body cavity, where they complete their development. Once mature, the gametes are shed into the surrounding water through ducts or openings that vary between species, or in some cases by the complete rupture of the body wall (and subsequent death of the adult). A few species copulate, but most fertilize their eggs externally.\nThe fertilized eggs typically hatch into trochophore larvae, which float among the plankton, and eventually metamorphose into the adult form by adding segments. A few species have no larval form, with the egg hatching into a form resembling the adult, and in many that do have larvae, the trochophore never feeds, surviving off the yolk that remains from the egg.\nHowever, some polychaetes exhibit remarkable reproductive strategies. Some species reproduce by epitoky. For much of the year, these worms look like any other burrow-dwelling polychaete, but as the breeding season approaches, the worm undergoes a remarkable transformation as new, specialized segments begin to grow from its rear end until the worm can be clearly divided into two halves. The front half, the atoke, is asexual. The new rear half, responsible for breeding, is known as the epitoke. Each of the epitoke segments is packed with eggs and sperm and features a single eyespot on its surface. The beginning of the last lunar quarter is the cue for these animals to breed, and the epitokes break free from the atokes and float to the surface. The eye spots sense when the epitoke reaches the surface and the segments from millions of worms burst, releasing their eggs and sperm into the water.\nA similar strategy is employed by the branching deep sea worm \"Syllis ramosa\", which lives inside a sponge; the worm develop \"stolons\" containing eggs or sperm from one of their many rear ends; these stolons detach from the parent worm and rise to the sea surface, where fertilisation takes place.\nEvolution.\nStem-group polychaete fossils are known from the Sirius Passet Lagerst\u00e4tte, a rich, sedimentary deposit in Greenland tentatively dated to the late Atdabanian (early Cambrian). The oldest known polychaete as of 2025 is \"Dannychaeta tucolus\", dated to approximately 514 million years ago. Many of the more famous Burgess Shale organisms, such as \"Canadia\", may also have polychaete affinities. \"Wiwaxia\", long interpreted as an annelid, is now considered to represent a mollusc. An even older fossil, \"Cloudina\", dates to the terminal Ediacaran period; this has been interpreted as an early polychaete, although consensus is absent.\nBeing soft-bodied organisms, the fossil record of polychaetes is dominated by their fossilized jaws, known as scolecodonts, and the mineralized tubes that some of them secrete. Most important biomineralising polychaetes are serpulids, sabellids, and cirratulids. Polychaete cuticle does have some preservation potential; it tends to survive for at least 30 days after a polychaete's death. Although biomineralisation is usually necessary to preserve soft tissue after this time, the presence of polychaete muscle in the nonmineralised Burgess shale shows this need not always be the case. Their preservation potential is similar to that of jellyfish.\nTaxonomy and systematics.\nTaxonomically, polychaetes are thought to be paraphyletic, meaning the group excludes some descendants of its most recent common ancestor. Groups that may be descended from the polychaetes include the clitellates (earthworms and leeches), sipunculans, and echiurans. The Pogonophora and Vestimentifera were once considered separate phyla, but are now classified in the polychaete family Siboglinidae.\nMuch of the classification below matches Rouse &amp; Fauchald, 1998, although that paper does not apply ranks above family.\nOlder classifications recognize many more (sub)orders than the layout presented here. As comparatively few polychaete taxa have been subject to cladistic analysis, some groups which are usually considered invalid today may eventually be reinstated.\nThese divisions were shown to be mostly paraphyletic in recent years.\nBelow is a phylogenetic tree of annelids from a 2021 review of annelid diversity (clades labeled \u00d7 are not considered polychaetes);\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "43209", "revid": "1318924824", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43209", "title": "Priapulida", "text": "Phylum of unsegmented marine worms\nPriapulida (priapulid worms, from Gr. \u03c0\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2, \"pri\u0101pos\" 'Priapus' + Lat. \"-ul-\", diminutive), sometimes referred to as penis worms, is a phylum of unsegmented marine worms. The name of the phylum relates to the Greek god of fertility, because their general shape and their extensible spiny introvert (eversible) proboscis may resemble the shape of a human penis. They live in the mud, except for a few tropical meiobenthic species which live in medium- to coarse-grained sands, and are found in comparatively shallow waters to deep waters and no warmer than 12\u201313\u00b0C. Some species show a remarkable tolerance for hydrogen sulfide, anoxia and low salinity. \"Halicryptus spinulosus\" appears to prefer brackish shallow waters. They can be quite abundant in some areas. In an Alaskan bay as many as 85 adult individuals of \"Priapulus caudatus\" per square meter has been recorded, while the density of its larvae can be as high as 58,000 per square meter (5,390 per square foot).\nTogether with Echiura and Sipuncula, they were once placed in the taxon Gephyrea, but consistent morphological and molecular evidence supports their belonging to Ecdysozoa, which also includes arthropods and nematodes. Fossil findings show that the mouth design of the stem-arthropod \"Pambdelurion\" is identical with that of priapulids, indicating that their mouth is an original trait inherited from the last common ancestor of both priapulids and arthropods, even if modern arthropods no longer possess it. Among Ecdysozoa, their nearest relatives are Kinorhyncha and Loricifera, with which they constitute the Scalidophora clade named after the spines covering the introvert (scalids). They feed on slow-moving invertebrates, such as polychaete worms.\nSome analyses suggest that Priapulida may represent a basal lineage within Ecdysozoa, leading to their classification as \"living fossils\". Priapulid-like fossils are known at least as far back as the Middle Cambrian. They were likely major predators of the Cambrian period. However, crown-group priapulids cannot be recognized until the Carboniferous. Twenty-two extant species of priapulid worms are known, half of them being of meiobenthic size.\nAnatomy.\nPriapulids are cylindrical worm-like animals, ranging from 0.2 to 0.3 to 39 centimetres (0.08\u20130.12 to 15.35 in) long, with a median anterior mouth quite devoid of any armature or tentacles. They show both radial and bilateral symmetry. The gonads, protonephridia and ventral nerve cord are bilateral, while the introvert, pharynx and brain show radial symmetry, and appears to be a secondary trait. Also the larvae show internal and external characteristics of radial symmetry. The adult body is divided into a main trunk or abdomen and a somewhat swollen proboscis region ornamented with longitudinal ridges. In addition it is ringed and often has circles of spines, which are continued into the slightly protrusible pharynx. Family Priapulidae have species with a tail or a pair of caudal appendages. A slender tail or tail filament is also found in family Tubiluchidae. Appendages are absent in the remaining families. The body has a chitinous cuticle that is moulted as the animal grows. Members of the family Chaetostephanidae also secretes a gelatinous tube, open in both ends, which they live in.\nThere is a wide body-cavity, which has no connection with the renal or reproductive organs, so it is not a coelom; it is probably a blood-space or hemocoel. There are no vascular or respiratory systems, but the body cavity does contain phagocytic amoebocytes and cells containing the respiratory pigment haemerythrin.\nThe alimentary canal is straight, consisting of an eversible pharynx, an intestine, and a short rectum. The pharynx is muscular and lined by teeth. Three of the five extant families have gone through a significant miniaturization and become detritivores (Tubiluchidae and Meiopriapulidae) and filter feeders (Chaetostephanidae). The two remaining families Priapulidae and Halicryptidae are larger carnivores that feed on other animals, although some species also consume detritus as larvae. The shape of the teeth reflect these different lifestyles, and seem to be adapted mainly towards grasping prey or raking detritus from the sediment into the mouth. The anus is terminal, although in \"Priapulus\" one or two hollow ventral diverticula of the body-wall stretch out behind it.\nThe nervous system consists of a nerve ring around the pharynx and a prominent cord running the length of the body with ganglia and longitudinal and transversal neurites consistent with an orthogonal organisation. The nervous system retains a basiepidermal configuration with a connection with the ectoderm, forming part of the body wall. There are no specialized sense organs, but there are sensory nerve endings in the body, especially on the proboscis.\nThe priapulids are gonochoristic, having two separate sexes (i.e. male and female). Their male and female organs are closely associated with the excretory protonephridia. They comprise a pair of branching tufts, each of which opens to the exterior on one side of the anus. The tips of these tufts enclose a flame-cell like those found in flatworms and other animals, and these probably function as excretory organs. As the animals mature, diverticula arise on the tubes of these organs, which develop either spermatozoa or ova. These sex cells pass out through the ducts. The perigenital area of the genus \"Tubiluchus\" exhibit sexual dimorphism.\nReproduction and development.\nFor the species \"Priapulus caudatus\", the 80\u00a0\u03bcm egg undergoes a total and radial cleavage following a symmetrical and subequal pattern. Development is remarkably slow, with the first cleavage taking place 15 hours after fertilization, gastrulation after several days and hatching of the first 'lorica' larvae after 15 to 20 days. The species \"Meiopriapulus fijiensis\" have direct development. In current systematics, they are described as protostomes, despite having a deuterostomic development. Because the group is so ancient, it is assumed the deuterostome condition which appears to be ancestral for bilaterians have been maintained.\nFossil record.\nStem-group priapulids are known from the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale, where their soft-part anatomy is preserved, often in conjunction with their gut contents \u2013 allowing a reconstruction of their diets. In addition, isolated microfossils (corresponding to the various teeth and spines that line the pharynx and introvert) are widespread in Cambrian deposits, allowing the distribution of priapulids \u2013 and even individual species \u2013 to be tracked widely through Cambrian oceans. Trace fossils that are morphologically almost identical to modern priapulid burrows (\"Treptichnus pedum\") officially mark the start of the Cambrian period, suggesting that priapulids, or at least close anatomical relatives, evolved around this time. Crown-group priapulid body fossils are first known from the Carboniferous.\nClassification.\nThere are 22 known extant species:\nPhylum Priapulida \nExtinct groups.\nStem-group \u2020Scalidophora\nStem-group \u2020Palaeoscolecida\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of 2023, the majority of scientists favor placing Vetulicolians in the stem group of the Chordata, but some continue to favor a more crownward placement as a sister group to the Tunicata. It was initially erected as a monophyletic clade with the rank of phylum in 2001, with subsequent work supporting its monophyly. However, more recent research suggests that vetulicolians may be paraphyletic and form a basal evolutionary grade of stem chordates.\nEtymology.\nThe taxon name, Vetulicolia, is derived from the type genus, \"Vetulicola\", which is a compound Latin word composed of \"vetuli\" \"old\" and \"cola\" \"inhabitant\". It was named after \"Vetulicola cuneata\", the first species of the group described in 1987.\nDescription.\nThe vetulicolian body plan comprises two parts: a voluminous rostral (anterior) forebody, tipped with an anteriorly positioned mouth and lined with a lateral row of five round to oval-shaped openings on each side, which have been interpreted as gills (or at least orifices in the vicinity of the pharynx); and a caudal (posterior) section that primitively comprises seven body segments and functions as a tail. All vetulicolians lack preserved appendages of any kind, having no legs, feelers or even eye spots. The area where the anterior and posterior parts join is constricted in most genera. Notochord-like structures have been found in some vetulicolian fossils.\nEcology and lifestyle.\nFrom their superficially tadpole-like forms, leaf or paddle-shaped tails, and various degrees of streamlining, it is assumed that all vetulicolians discovered to date were swimming animals that spent much, if not all, of their time living in water. Some groups, like the genus \"Vetulicola\", were more streamlined (complete with ventral keels) than other groups, such as the tadpole-like Didazoonidae.\nBecause all vetulicolians had mouths which had no features for chewing or grasping, it is assumed that they were not predators. Since vetulicolians possessed gill slits, many researchers regard these organisms as planktivores. The sediment infills in the guts of their fossils have caused some to suggest that they were deposit feeders. This idea has been contested, as deposit feeders tend to have straight guts, whereas the hindguts of vetulicolians were spiral-shaped. Some researchers propose that the vetulicolians were \"selective deposit-feeders\" which actively swam from one region of the seafloor to another, while supplementing their nutrition with filter-feeding.\nThe earliest vetulicolians appear to have lived in shallow water, with the first deeper water specimens appearing in the Balang biota and possibly in the Qingjiang biota.\nTaxonomy and evolution.\nThe phylum Vetulicolia was erected in 2001 to group the genera \"Vetulicola\", \"Didazoon\", and \"Xidazoon\" (later deemed a junior synonym of \"Pomatrum\"). Prior to this the class Vetulicolida had been defined in 1997 to group \"Vetulicola\" with the previously enigmatic genus \"Banffia\" due to its similar two-part construction, as well as apparent gill slits in a newly discovered specimen. Further work split \"Banffia\" into a separate class called Banffozoa, which was soon expanded to encompass similar species such as \"Heteromorphus\".\nWhile subsequent studies supported the monophyly of Vetulicolia, it has also been noted that this would preclude vetulicolians representing a stepwise development of deuterostome characteristics, as the genus with the most such characteristics, \"Vetulicola\", is one of the most derived in the group.\nA 2024 phylogenetic analysis by Mussini and colleagues found vetulicolians to be a paraphyletic group of stem-chordates, lying outside a clade formed by \"Yunnanozoon\", \"Cathaymyrus\", \"Pikaia\" and crown-chordates. This is in part due to the Cambroernida, which are basal stem-ambulacrarians, being discovered to share with vetulicolians a lack of crown-group chordate characters such as a post-anal tail, despite such characteristics previously being believed to be present in the last common ancestor of deuterostomes. However, ascidian larvae have been noted to have endoderm extending to the terminal end, which could suggest that the ancestral tunicate also had a terminal anus.\nOther possible placements are suggested by the Centroneuralia hypothesis, which features a paraphyletic Deuterostomia with chordates as the sister-group to protostomes. If proven true, pharyngeal slits would no longer require a deuterostome placement and vetulicolians could prove to be stem protostomes that lost the post-anal tail. In such a scenario, Banffozoa could be a more derived stem protostome group than Vetulicolida.\nCladograms.\nThe following cladograms show two possible placements of the Vetulicolia.\nFirst, on the left, a monophyletic Vetulicolia is shown as the sister group to Tunicata, but with all internal relationships unresolved.\nNext, on the right, the two proposed classes are shown as the earlier (Banffozoa) and later (Vetulicolida) parts of the vetulicolian grade. Within the Vetulicolida, the family Vetulicolidae as defined by Li \"et al.\" (2018) is recovered as monophyletic, while the three widely accepted members of the Didazoonidae are in a polytomy with the clade of crownward chordates.\nThe possible presence of a notochord in \"Nesonektris\" and the lack of clear evidence for one in \"Pikaia\" is relevant to the validity of the following cladograms. Proponents of a monophyletic Vetulicolia as the sister group of Tunicata note that scoring the notochord as \"unknown\" in \"Nesonektris\" produces the same topology, albeit with less support for certain nodes. Proponents of a paraphyletic Vetulicolia, who assume that both \"Pikaia\" and \"Nesonektris\" lacked a notochord, similarly note that scoring \"Nesonektris\" as having a notochord did not significantly change their topology. They also noted that fossils of unambiguous crown-group chordates also frequently lack a visible notochord, but the paper cited regarding this lack lists the notochord as one of the last anatomical structures to decay, with other structures preserved in \"Pikaia\" more likely to decay more quickly. Alternatively, a separate paper examining hypotheses regarding a notochord in \"Pikaia\" notes that it may have been lost as other structures evolved to take over its function.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-float/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-float/styles.css\" /&gt;\nClassification.\nThe following classification is taken from Li \"et al.\" (2018) except where noted.\nHistory of identification.\nThe current consensus view is that vetulicolians are stem group chordates, although some researchers continue to raise other possibilities. The possible identification of an endostyle bolstered theories of a tunicate affinity, but was later retracted, while the tentative identification of a notochord in \"Nesonektris\" and \"Vetulicola\" has further supported overall chordate affinities. Other characters that have been used to support a tunicate affinity include the limiting of the notochord to the tail and the presence of a stiff cuticle (tunic).\nRecent research has strengthened the arguments for placing vetulicolians in the chordate stem lineage rather than near the tunicates. Like vetulicolians, members of the basal ambulacrarian clade Cambroernida have a terminal anus rather than a post-anal tail. Since Ambulacraria is the sister-group of the chordates within the deuterostomes, this suggests that the last common ancestor of both groups lacked a post-anal tail. However, ascidian larvae have been noted to have endoderm extending to the terminal end, which could suggest that tunicates also lacked post-anal tails ancestrally.\nSome workers have questioned the inclusion of Banffozoa within this group due to their lack of gill slits and apparent gut diverticula, and have theorized that they may fit within Protostomia instead. \"Skeemella\", in particular, has been noted as having striking arthropod-like characteristics. However, \"Herpetogaster\", the most basal cambroernid, is thought to have non-serialized pores for pharyngial openings. If banffozoans are the most basal vetulicolians, this could explain why they also lack serialized pharyngeal structures. Additionally, a comprehensive review of the Vetulicolia in 2007 did not find evidence of gut diverticula in their material while acknowledging the previous report regarding \"Banffia\". \"Shenzianyuloma\" has been interpreted as a vetulicolian with both a notochord (a definitively deuterostome trait) and gut diverticula. However, the single fossil of this genus is of unusual provenance (a \"crystal and fossil vendor\"), and has not yet been examined by other researchers.\n Adapted from cladograms in Aldridge \"et al.\" 2007, showing each possible placement for Vetulicolia considered in the paper; note the presence of the Euchordata clade rather than the now-favored Olfactores.\nVetulicolians were thought to be stem arthropods when \"Vetulicola\" was first discovered, but around 2001 the focus of most theories shifted towards stem deuterostomes due to the discovery of pharyngial gill slits (a deuterostome characteristic), as well as the mounting evidence that vetuicolians have no appendages of any kind. A theory grouping both vetulicolians and vetulocystids with \"Saccorhytus\" was disproven when the alleged pharyngial openings of \"Saccorhytus\" were shown to be remnants of spines that had broken off; the saccorhytids are now considered to be ecdysozoans.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Such empirical distributions are said to be quasi-Zipfian.\nHistory.\nIn 1913, the German physicist Felix Auerbach observed an inverse proportionality between the population sizes of cities, and their ranks when sorted by decreasing order of that variable.\nZipf's law had been discovered before Zipf, first by the French stenographer Jean-Baptiste Estoup in 1916, and also by G. Dewey in 1923, and by E. Condon in 1928.\nThe same relation for frequencies of words in natural language texts was observed by George Zipf in 1932, but he never claimed to have originated it. In fact, Zipf did not like mathematics. In his 1932 publication, the author speaks with disdain about mathematical involvement in linguistics, \"a.o. ibidem\", p.\u00a021:\n \"... let me say here for the sake of any mathematician who may plan to formulate the ensuing data more exactly, the ability of the highly intense positive to become the highly intense negative, in my opinion, introduces the devil into the formula in the form of\" formula_7\nThe only mathematical expression Zipf used looks like which he \"borrowed\" from Alfred J. Lotka's 1926 publication.\nThe same relationship was found to occur in many other contexts, and for other variables besides frequency. For example, when corporations are ranked by decreasing size, their sizes are found to be inversely proportional to the rank. The same relation is found for personal incomes (where it is called Pareto principle), number of people watching the same TV channel, notes in music, cells transcriptomes, and more.\nIn 1957 George A. Miller proposed that a power law emerges even in randomly generated texts. and in \n1992 bioinformatician Wentian Li published a proof that the power law form of Zipf's law was a byproduct of ordering words by rank.\nFormal definition.\n&lt;/math&gt; where \"HN,s\" is the \"N\"th generalized harmonic number\nFormally, the Zipf distribution on N elements assigns to the element of rank k (counting from 1) the probability:\nformula_15 where HN is a normalization constant: The Nth harmonic number:\nformula_16\nThe distribution is sometimes generalized to an inverse power law with exponent s instead of 1. Namely,\nformula_17\nwhere HN,s is a generalized harmonic number\nformula_18\nThe generalized Zipf distribution can be extended to infinitely many items (N = \u221e) only if the exponent s exceeds 1. In that case, the normalization constant HN,s becomes Riemann's zeta function,\nformula_19\nThe infinite item case is characterized by the Zeta distribution and is called Lotka's law. If the exponent s is 1 or less, the normalization constant HN,s diverges as N tends to infinity.\nEmpirical testing.\nEmpirically, a data set can be tested to see whether Zipf's law applies by checking the goodness of fit of an empirical distribution to the hypothesized power law distribution with a Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test, and then comparing the (log) likelihood ratio of the power law distribution to alternative distributions like an exponential distribution or lognormal distribution.\nZipf's law can be visualized by plotting the item frequency data on a log-log graph, with the axes being the logarithm of rank order, and logarithm of frequency. The data conform to Zipf's law with exponent s to the extent that the plot approximates a linear (more precisely, affine) function with slope \u2212s. For exponent one can also plot the reciprocal of the frequency (mean interword interval) against rank, or the reciprocal of rank against frequency, and compare the result with the line through the origin with slope 1\u00a0.\nStatistical explanations.\nAlthough Zipf's law holds for most natural languages, and even certain artificial ones such as Esperanto and Toki Pona, the reason is still not well understood. Recent reviews of generative processes for Zipf's law include Mitzenmacher, \"A Brief History of Generative Models for Power Law and Lognormal Distributions\", and Simkin, \"Re-inventing Willis\".\nHowever, it may be partly explained by statistical analysis of randomly generated texts. Wentian Li has shown that in a document in which each character has been chosen randomly from a uniform distribution of all letters (plus a space character), the \"words\" with different lengths follow the macro-trend of Zipf's law (the more probable words are the shortest and have equal probability). In 1959, Vitold Belevitch observed that if any of a large class of well-behaved statistical distributions (not only the normal distribution) is expressed in terms of rank and expanded into a Taylor series, the first-order truncation of the series results in Zipf's law. Further, a second-order truncation of the Taylor series resulted in Mandelbrot's law.\nThe principle of least effort is another possible explanation:\nZipf himself proposed that neither speakers nor hearers using a given language want to work any harder than necessary to reach understanding, and the process that results in approximately equal distribution of effort leads to the observed Zipf distribution.\nA minimal explanation assumes that words are generated by monkeys typing randomly. If language is generated by a single monkey typing randomly, with fixed and nonzero probability of hitting each letter key or white space, then the words (letter strings separated by white spaces) produced by the monkey follows Zipf's law.\nAnother possible cause for the Zipf distribution is a preferential attachment process, in which the value x of an item tends to grow at a rate proportional to x (intuitively, \"the rich get richer\" or \"success breeds success\"). Such a growth process results in the Yule\u2013Simon distribution, which has been shown to fit word frequency versus rank in language and population versus city rank better than Zipf's law. It was originally derived to explain population versus rank in species by Yule, and applied to cities by Simon.\nA similar explanation is based on atlas models, systems of exchangeable positive-valued diffusion processes with drift and variance parameters that depend only on the rank of the process. It has been shown mathematically that Zipf's law holds for Atlas models that satisfy certain natural regularity conditions.\nRelated laws.\nA generalization of Zipf's law is the Zipf\u2013Mandelbrot law, proposed by Benoit Mandelbrot, whose frequencies are:\nformula_20\nThe constant C is the Hurwitz zeta function evaluated at s.\nZipfian distributions can be obtained from Pareto distributions by an exchange of variables.\nThe Zipf distribution is sometimes called the discrete Pareto distribution because it is analogous to the continuous Pareto distribution in the same way that the discrete uniform distribution is analogous to the continuous uniform distribution.\nThe tail frequencies of the Yule\u2013Simon distribution are approximately\nformula_21 for any choice of \nIn the parabolic fractal distribution, the logarithm of the frequency is a quadratic polynomial of the logarithm of the rank. This can markedly improve the fit over a simple power-law relationship. Like fractal dimension, it is possible to calculate Zipf dimension, which is a useful parameter in the analysis of texts.\nIt has been argued that Benford's law is a special bounded case of Zipf's law, with the connection between these two laws being explained by their both originating from scale invariant functional relations from statistical physics and critical phenomena. The ratios of probabilities in Benford's law are not constant. The leading digits of data satisfying Zipf's law with satisfy Benford's law.\nOccurrences.\nCity sizes.\nFollowing Auerbach's 1913 observation, there has been substantial examination of Zipf's law for city sizes. However, more recent empirical and theoretical studies have challenged the relevance of Zipf's law for cities.\nWord frequencies in natural languages.\nIn many texts in human languages, word frequencies approximately follow a Zipf distribution with exponent s close to 1; that is, the most common word occurs about n times the n-th most common one.\nThe actual rank-frequency plot of a natural language text deviates in some extent from the ideal Zipf distribution, especially at the two ends of the range. The deviations may depend on the language, on the topic of the text, on the author, on whether the text was translated from another language, and on the spelling rules used. Some deviation is inevitable because of sampling error.\nAt the low-frequency end, where the rank approaches N, the plot takes a staircase shape, because each word can occur only an integer number of times.\nIn some Romance languages, the frequencies of the dozen or so most frequent words deviate significantly from the ideal Zipf distribution, because those words include articles inflected for grammatical gender and number.\nIn many East Asian languages, such as Chinese, Tibetan, and Vietnamese, each morpheme (word or word piece) consists of a single syllable; a word of English being often translated to a compound of two such syllables. The rank-frequency table for those morphemes deviates significantly from the ideal Zipf law, at both ends of the range.\nEven in English, the deviations from the ideal Zipf's law become more apparent as one examines large collections of texts. Analysis of a corpus of 30,000 English texts showed that only about 15% of the texts in it have a good fit to Zipf's law. Slight changes in the definition of Zipf's law can increase this percentage up to close to 50%.\nIn these cases, the observed frequency-rank relation can be modeled more accurately as by separate Zipf\u2013Mandelbrot laws distributions for different subsets or subtypes of words. This is the case for the frequency-rank plot of the first 10\u00a0million words of the English Wikipedia. In particular, the frequencies of the closed class of function words in English is better described with s lower than 1, while open-ended vocabulary growth with document size and corpus size require s greater than 1 for convergence of the Generalized Harmonic Series.\nWhen a text is encrypted in such a way that every occurrence of each distinct plaintext word is always mapped to the same encrypted word (as in the case of simple substitution ciphers, like the Caesar ciphers, or simple codebook ciphers), the frequency-rank distribution is not affected. On the other hand, if separate occurrences of the same word may be mapped to two or more different words (as happens with the Vigen\u00e8re cipher), the Zipf distribution will typically have a flat part at the high-frequency end.\nApplications.\nZipf's law has been used for extraction of parallel fragments of texts out of comparable corpora. Laurance Doyle and others have suggested the application of Zipf's law for detection of alien language in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.\nThe frequency-rank word distribution is often characteristic of the author and changes little over time. This feature has been used in the analysis of texts for authorship attribution.\nThe word-like sign groups of the 15th-century codex Voynich Manuscript have been found to satisfy Zipf's law, suggesting that text is most likely not a hoax but rather written in an obscure language or cipher.\nWhale communication.\nRecent analysis of whale vocalization samples shows they contain recurring phonemes whose distribution appears to closely obey Zipf's Law.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is widely regarded as one of the greatest managers of all time, having won more trophies than any other manager in the history of football. Ferguson is often credited for valuing youth during his time at Manchester United, particularly in the 1990s with the \"Class of '92\", who contributed to making the club one of the most successful in the world.\nFerguson played as a forward for several Scottish clubs, including Dunfermline Athletic and Rangers. While playing for Dunfermline, he was the top goalscorer in the Scottish league during the 1965\u201366 season. Towards the end of his playing career, he also worked as a coach, then started his managerial career with East Stirlingshire and St Mirren. Ferguson then enjoyed a highly successful period as manager of Aberdeen, winning three Scottish league championships, four Scottish Cups and both the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup in 1983. He briefly managed Scotland following the death of Jock Stein, taking the team to the 1986 World Cup.\nFerguson was appointed manager of Manchester United in November 1986. During his 26 years with Manchester United, he won 38 trophies, including 13 Premier League titles, five FA Cups, and two UEFA Champions League titles. He was knighted in the 1999 Queen's Birthday Honours list for his services to the game. Ferguson is the longest-serving manager of Manchester United, having overtaken Sir Matt Busby's record on 19 December 2010. He retired from management at the end of the 2012\u201313 season, having won the Premier League in his final season.\nEarly life.\nAlexander Chapman Ferguson was born at his grandmother's home on Shieldhall Road in the Govan district of Glasgow on 31 December 1941, the son of Elizabeth (n\u00e9e Hardie) and Alexander Beaton Ferguson. His father was a plater's helper in the shipbuilding industry. He grew up in a tenement at 667 Govan Road, which has since been demolished, where he lived with his parents and his younger brother Martin, who also became a footballer. He attended Broomloan Road Primary School and later Govan High School. He began his football career with Harmony Row Boys Club in Govan, before progressing to Drumchapel Amateurs, a youth club with a strong reputation for producing senior footballers. He also took an apprenticeship as a toolmaker at a factory in Hillington, being appointed a union shop steward.\nPlaying career.\nClub.\nFerguson's playing career began as an amateur with Queen's Park, where he made his debut as a striker, aged 16. He described his first match as a \"nightmare\", but scored Queen's Park's goal in a 2\u20131 defeat against Stranraer. Perhaps his most notable game for Queen's Park was the 7\u20131 defeat away to Queen of the South on Boxing Day 1959 when ex-England international Ivor Broadis scored four of the Queen of the South goals. Ferguson was the solitary Queen's Park goalscorer.\nDespite scoring 20 goals in his 31 games for Queen's Park, he could not command a regular place in the side and moved to St Johnstone in 1960. Ferguson was on a part-time contract with St Johnstone, and he combined working in a Govan shipyard with training at night in Perth. Although he regularly scored goals for St Johnstone, he was unable to command a consistent place in their team. He regularly requested transfers, and even considered emigrating to Canada. St Johnstone's failure to sign another forward led the manager to select Ferguson for a match against Rangers, in which he scored a hat-trick in a surprise 3\u20132 victory at Ibrox.\nDunfermline signed him the following summer (1964), and Ferguson became a full-time professional footballer. In the following season (1964\u201365) Dunfermline were strong challengers for the Scottish league title and reached the Scottish Cup final, but Ferguson was dropped for the final after a poor performance in a league game against St Johnstone. Dunfermline lost the final 3\u20132 to Celtic, then failed to win the League by one point. The 1965\u201366 season saw Ferguson notch up 45 goals in 51 games for Dunfermline. Along with Joe McBride of Celtic, he was the top goalscorer in the Scottish league with 31 goals.\nFerguson then joined Rangers for \u00a365,000, which was a record fee for a transfer between two Scottish clubs. He performed well in Europe during his two seasons with the club, scoring six goals in nine appearances in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup including two against 1.FC K\u00f6ln in the 1967\u201368 competition, and an important strike against Athletic Bilbao in the 1968\u201369 edition which helped Rangers into the semi-finals, but on both occasions they were knocked out by English opposition. He was blamed for a goal conceded in the 1969 Scottish Cup final, in a match in which he was designated to mark Celtic captain, Billy McNeill, and was subsequently forced to play for the club's junior side instead of for the first team. According to his brother, Ferguson was so upset by the experience that he threw his losers' medal away.\nThere have been claims that he suffered discrimination at Rangers due to his marriage to a Catholic, Cathy Holding. Ferguson said in a 2021 documentary film about his life and career (\"\") that he \"assumed\" that his exclusion from the first team after the 1969 cup final was due to her religion. His autobiography noted that Rangers had known of his wife's religion when he joined the club. In March 2021, he added that when he was signed, a Rangers director had questioned whether the Fergusons had been married in a (Catholic) chapel, and that the director had replied \"oh, that's okay\" when told they had married in a registry office. Ferguson left Rangers reluctantly, as he had grown up locally and had dreamed of succeeding there. He was upset by how newspapers would refer to him as an \"ex-Rangers player\" after he had left, and rarely attended gatherings of their former players.\nThe following October, Nottingham Forest wanted to sign Ferguson, but his wife was not keen on moving to England at that time, so he went to Falkirk instead. He remained at Brockville for four years, gaining more league appearances than he had elsewhere; in recognition of his experience he was promoted to player-coach, but when John Prentice became manager he removed Ferguson's coaching responsibilities. Ferguson's time at Falkirk was soured by this, and he responded by requesting a transfer and moved to Ayr United, where he finished his playing career in 1974.\nInternational.\nFerguson's only involvement with the Scotland national team was during an overseas tour in 1967. For many years none of the tour matches were recognised by the Scottish Football Association as full internationals, and so Ferguson was deemed to have never played for Scotland. A \"BBC Sport\" article in June 2020 identified him as one of the best Scottish players to have never played a full international. The SFA announced in October 2021 that some of the tour matches would be reclassified as full internationals, which meant that Ferguson was belatedly awarded an international cap.\nManagerial career.\nEast Stirlingshire.\nIn June 1974, Ferguson was appointed manager of East Stirlingshire, at the comparatively young age of 32. It was a part-time job that paid \u00a340 per week, and the club did not have a single goalkeeper at the time. He gained a reputation as a disciplinarian, with club forward Bobby McCulley later saying he had \"never been afraid of anyone before but Ferguson was a frightening bastard from the start.\"\nSt Mirren.\nIn October 1974, Ferguson was invited to manage St Mirren. While they were below East Stirlingshire in the league, they were a bigger club and although Ferguson felt a degree of loyalty towards East Stirlingshire, he decided to join St Mirren after taking advice from Jock Stein.\nFerguson was manager of St Mirren from 1974 until 1978, producing a remarkable transformation of a team in the lower half of the old Second Division watched by crowds of just over 1,000, to First Division champions in 1977, discovering talent like Billy Stark, Tony Fitzpatrick, Lex Richardson, Frank McGarvey, Bobby Reid and Peter Weir while playing superb attacking football. The average age of the league winning team was 19 and the captain, Fitzpatrick, was 20.\nSt Mirren have the distinction of being the only club ever to sack Ferguson. He claimed wrongful dismissal against the club at an industrial tribunal but lost and was given no leave to appeal. According to a \"Sunday Herald\" article on 30 May 1999, the official version is that Ferguson was sacked for various breaches of contract, including unauthorised payments to players. He was counter-accused of intimidating behaviour towards his office secretary because he wanted players to get some expenses tax free. He did not speak to her for six weeks, confiscated her keys and communicated only through a 17-year-old assistant. The tribunal concluded that Ferguson was \"particularly petty\" and \"immature\". It was claimed during the tribunal by St Mirren chairman, Willie Todd, that Ferguson had \"no managerial ability\".\nIn 2008, \"The Guardian\" published an interview with Todd (then aged 87), who had sacked Ferguson many years earlier. Todd said that the fundamental reason for the dismissal was a breach of contract relating to Ferguson having agreed to join Aberdeen. Ferguson told journalist Jim Rodger of the \"Daily Mirror\" that he had asked at least one member of the squad to go to Aberdeen with him. He told the St Mirren staff he was leaving. Todd expressed regret over what happened but blamed Aberdeen for not approaching his club to discuss compensation.\nIn 1977, Ferguson turned down the manager's job at Aberdeen. The role went to Billy McNeill, who returned to Celtic after only a year, leaving the role available for Ferguson once again.\nAberdeen.\nLate 1970s.\nFerguson joined Aberdeen as manager in June 1978. Although Aberdeen were one of Scotland's major clubs they had won the league only once, in 1955 under Dave Halliday. The team had been playing well, however, and had not lost a league match since the previous December, having finished second in the league the previous season. Ferguson had now been a manager for four years, but was still not much older than some of the players and had trouble winning the respect of some of the older ones such as Joe Harper. The season did not go especially well, with Aberdeen reaching the semi-final of the Scottish Cup and the Scottish League Cup Final, but losing both matches and finishing fourth in the league.\nAberdeen lost the 1979\u201380 Scottish League Cup Final, this time to Dundee United after a replay. Ferguson took the blame for the defeat, saying he should have made changes to the team for the replay.\n1980s and silverware.\nAberdeen had started the 1979\u201380 season poorly but their form improved dramatically in the new year and they won the Scottish league that season with a 5\u20130 win on the final day. It was the first time in 15 years that the league had not been won by either Rangers or Celtic. Ferguson now felt that he had the respect of his players, later saying: \"That was the achievement which united us. I finally had the players believing in me\".\nHe was still a strict disciplinarian, though, and his players nicknamed him \"Furious Fergie\". He fined one of his players, John Hewitt, for overtaking him on a public road, and kicked a tea urn at the players at half time after a poor first half. He was dissatisfied with the atmosphere at Aberdeen matches, and deliberately created a \"siege mentality\" by accusing the Scottish media of being biased towards the Glasgow clubs, to motivate the team. The team continued their success with a Scottish Cup win in 1982. Ferguson was offered the manager's job at Wolverhampton Wanderers but turned it down as he felt that Wolves were in trouble and his \"ambitions at Aberdeen were not even half fulfilled\".\nEuropean success and Scottish national side.\nFerguson led Aberdeen to even greater success the following season, 1982\u201383. They had qualified for the European Cup Winners' Cup as a result of winning the Scottish Cup the previous season, and impressively knocked out Bayern Munich, who had beaten Tottenham Hotspur 4\u20131 in the previous round. According to Willie Miller, this gave them the confidence to believe that they could go on to win the competition, which they did, with a 2\u20131 victory over Real Madrid in the final on 11 May 1983. Aberdeen became only the third Scottish team to win a European trophy and Ferguson now felt that \"he'd done something worthwhile with his life\". This was followed up with victory in the European Super Cup in December 1983, when Hamburger SV, the reigning European Cup champions, were beaten 2\u20130 over two legs. Aberdeen had also performed well in the league that season, and retained the Scottish Cup with a 1\u20130 victory over Rangers, but Ferguson was not happy with his team's play in that match and upset the players by describing theirs as a \"disgraceful performance\" in a televised interview after the match, a statement he later retracted.\nAfter a sub-standard start to the 1983\u201384 season, Aberdeen's form improved and the team won the Scottish league and retained the Scottish Cup. Ferguson was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1985 New Year Honours, and was offered the managers' jobs at Rangers and Arsenal during the season. Aberdeen retained their league title in the 1984\u201385 season. In 1985\u201386, Aberdeen won both domestic cups, but finished fourth in the league. Ferguson had been appointed to the club's board of directors early in 1986, but that April he told Dick Donald, their chairman, that he intended to leave that summer.\nFerguson had been part of the coaching staff for the Scottish national side during qualifying for the 1986 World Cup, but manager Jock Stein had collapsed and died on 10 September 1985 \u2013 at the end of the game in which Scotland qualified from their group for a play-off against Australia. Ferguson promptly agreed to take charge of the Scottish national side against the Australians and subsequently at the World Cup. To allow him to fulfil his international duties he appointed Archie Knox as his co-manager at Aberdeen. However, after Scotland failed to progress past the group stages of the World Cup, Ferguson stepped down as national team manager on 15 June 1986.\nAround this time, Tottenham Hotspur offered Ferguson the chance to take over from Peter Shreeves as manager, but he rejected this offer and the job went to Luton Town's David Pleat instead. There was also an offer for Ferguson to replace Don Howe as Arsenal manager, but he rejected this offer as well, and fellow Scot George Graham took the post instead. That summer, there had been speculation that he would take over from Ron Atkinson at Manchester United, who had slumped to fourth in the English top flight after a ten-match winning start.\nIt was not the first time that Ferguson had been linked with a move to England. In February 1982, Wolverhampton Wanderers had approached him about succeeding John Barnwell as manager as they were heading for relegation from the First Division. He rejected this offer, perhaps concerned about the club's financial stability, as they were more than \u00a32\u00a0million in debt at the time and narrowly avoided going out of business. At the end of the 1984\u201385 season, it was reported that Ferguson was being considered for the Liverpool manager's job after the retirement of Joe Fagan was announced, but the job was quickly accepted by Liverpool striker Kenny Dalglish.\nAlthough Ferguson remained at Aberdeen over the summer, he did eventually join Manchester United when Atkinson was sacked in November 1986.\nManchester United.\nAppointment and first FA Cup title.\nFerguson was appointed manager at Old Trafford on 6 November 1986. He was initially worried that many of the players, such as Norman Whiteside, Paul McGrath and Bryan Robson were drinking too much and was \"depressed\" by their level of fitness, but he managed to increase the players' discipline and United climbed up the table to finish the season in 11th place, having been 21st (second from bottom) when he took over.\nHis first game in charge was a 2\u20130 defeat at Oxford United on 8 November, followed seven days later by a goalless draw at newly promoted Norwich City, and then his first win (1\u20130 at home to Queens Park Rangers) on 22 November. Results steadily improved as the season went on, and by the time they recorded what would be their only away win of the league campaign at title challengers and rivals Liverpool on Boxing Day, it was clear that United were on the road to recovery. The year 1987 began on a high note with a 4\u20131 victory over Newcastle United and United gradually pulled together in the second half of the season, with relatively occasional defeats on the way, and finished 11th in the final table. Ferguson's mother Elizabeth died of lung cancer, aged 64, three weeks after his appointment. Ferguson hired Archie Knox, his assistant at Aberdeen, in the same role at Manchester United in 1986.\nIn the 1987\u201388 season, Ferguson made several major signings, including Steve Bruce, Viv Anderson and Brian McClair. The new players made a positive contribution to a United team who finished in second place, nine points behind Liverpool. Liverpool's points lead, however, had been in double digits for most of the season and while United had lost only five league games all season, they drew 12 games, leaving some way to go before United could match their northwestern rivals.\nDuring the season, United played two friendly matches in Bermuda against the Bermuda national team and the Somerset Cricket Club. In the match against Somerset, both Ferguson himself and his assistant Archie Knox took to the field, with Knox even getting on the scoresheet. The match was Ferguson's only appearance for the Manchester United first team.\nUnited were expected to do well when Mark Hughes returned to the club two years after leaving for Barcelona, alongside Jim Leighton from Aberdeen; but the 1988\u201389 season was a disappointment for them, finishing 11th in the league and losing 1\u20130 at home to Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup sixth round. They had begun the season slowly, going on a nine-match winless run throughout October and November (with one defeat and eight draws) before a run of generally good results took them to third place and the fringes of the title challenge by mid February. However, another run of disappointing results in the final quarter of the season saw them fall down to mid-table.\nFor the 1989\u201390 season, Ferguson further boosted his squad by paying large sums of money for midfielders Neil Webb, Mike Phelan, and Paul Ince, as well as defender Gary Pallister and winger Danny Wallace. The season began well with a 4\u20131 win over defending champions Arsenal on the opening day, but United's league form quickly turned sour. In September, United suffered a humiliating 5\u20131 away defeat against fierce rivals Manchester City. Following this and an early season run of six defeats and two draws in eight games, a banner declaring, \"Three years of excuses and it's still crap\u00a0... ta-ra Fergie.\" was displayed at Old Trafford, and many journalists and supporters called for Ferguson to be sacked. Ferguson later described December 1989 as \"the darkest period [he had] ever suffered in the game\", as United ended the decade just outside the relegation zone.\nFollowing a run of seven games without a win, Manchester United were drawn away to Nottingham Forest in the third round of the FA Cup. Forest were performing well that season and were in the process of winning the League Cup for the second season running, and it was expected that United would lose the match and Ferguson would consequently be sacked, but United won the game 1\u20130 due to a Mark Robins goal and eventually reached the final. This cup win is often cited as the match that saved Ferguson's Old Trafford career. United went on to win the FA Cup, beating Crystal Palace 1\u20130 in the final replay after a 3\u20133 draw in the first match, giving Ferguson his first major trophy as Manchester United manager. United's defensive frailties in the first match were blamed on goalkeeper Jim Leighton. Ferguson dropped Leighton for the replay, bringing in Les Sealey.\nUnited's European firsts and Ferguson's seconds.\nAlthough United's league form improved greatly in 1990\u201391, they were still inconsistent and finished sixth. There were some excellent performances that season, including a 6\u20132 demolition of Arsenal at Highbury, but results like an early 2\u20131 loss at newly promoted Sunderland, a 4\u20130 September hammering by Liverpool at Anfield, and a 2\u20130 home defeat by Everton in early March (the game where 17-year-old talented prospect Ryan Giggs made his senior debut) showed that United still had some way to go.\nEven after the FA Cup victory in the previous season, some still had doubts about Ferguson's ability to succeed where all the other managers since Matt Busby had failed\u00a0\u2013 to win the league title. They were runners-up in the League Cup, losing 1\u20130 to Sheffield Wednesday. However, they won the European Cup Winners' Cup, beating that season's Spanish champions Barcelona 2\u20131. It would be United's only Cup Winners' Cup title. After the match, Ferguson vowed that United would win the league the following season, and at long last he seemed to have won over the last of his sceptics after nearly five years in the job.\nDuring the 1991 close season, Ferguson's assistant Archie Knox departed to Rangers to become assistant to Walter Smith, and Ferguson promoted youth team coach Brian Kidd to the role of assistant manager in Knox's place. He also made two major signings \u2013 goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel and defender Paul Parker \u2013 to bolster his side. There was much anticipation about the breakthrough of the young Ryan Giggs, who had played twice and scored once in the 1990\u201391 campaign, and the earlier emergence of another impressive young winger in the shape of Lee Sharpe, who despite their youth had made Ferguson feel able to resist plunging into the transfer market and buying a new player to take over from the disappointing Danny Wallace on the left wing. He had also added Soviet midfielder Andrei Kanchelskis to the right wing, giving him a more attacking alternative to older midfielders Mike Phelan and Bryan Robson.\nThe 1991\u201392 season did not live up to Ferguson's expectations and, in Ferguson's words, \"many in the media felt that [his] mistakes had contributed to the misery\". United won the League Cup and European Super Cup; both for the first time, but lost out on the league title to rivals Leeds United after leading the table for much of the season. A shortage of goals and being held to draws by teams they had been expected to beat in the second half of the campaign had proved to be the undoing of a United side who had performed so well in the first half of the season. Ferguson felt that his failure to secure the signing of Mick Harford from Luton Town had cost United the league, and that he needed \"an extra dimension\" to the team if they were to win the league the following season.\nDuring the 1992 close season, Ferguson went on the hunt for a new striker. He first attempted to sign Alan Shearer from Southampton, but lost out to Blackburn Rovers. He also made at least one approach for the Sheffield Wednesday striker David Hirst, but manager Trevor Francis rejected all offers and the player stayed put. In the end, he paid \u00a31\u00a0million for 23-year-old Cambridge United striker Dion Dublin \u2013 his only major signing of the summer.\nAfter a slow start to the 1992\u201393 season by sitting 10th at the beginning of November, it looked as though United would miss out on the league title yet again. However, after the purchase of French striker Eric Cantona from Leeds for \u00a31.2\u00a0million, the future of Manchester United, and Ferguson's position as manager, began to look bright. Cantona formed a strong partnership with Mark Hughes. On 10 April 1993, United were second in the league when they faced Sheffield Wednesday at home. United were losing with four minutes to go before Steve Bruce equalised. After seven minutes of injury time \u2013 which was subsequently dubbed \"Fergie Time\", alluding to extra minutes allegedly being granted to Ferguson's teams to get a goal \u2013 Bruce scored the 97th-minute winner, with Ferguson celebrating the goal by running from his dugout on to the touch line, while assistant Brian Kidd ran on to the field. Seen as being a decisive victory, it put United top of the league, where they remained. Winning the title ended United's 26-year wait for a league title, and also made them the first Premier League champions. United finished with a ten-point margin over runners-up Aston Villa, whose 1\u20130 defeat at Oldham Athletic on 2 May 1993 had given United the title. Ferguson was later voted Manager of the Year by the League Managers' Association.\n1993\u201395: Double win and loss.\nThe 1993\u201394 season brought more success. Ferguson added Nottingham Forest's 22-year-old midfielder Roy Keane to the ranks for a British record fee of \u00a33.75\u00a0million as a long term replacement for Bryan Robson, who was nearing the end of his career. United led the 1993\u201394 Premier League table virtually from start to finish. Ferguson was the first winner of the Premier League Manager of the Month award, introduced for the start of the 1993\u201394 season, when he collected the accolade for August 1993. Cantona was top scorer with 25 goals in all competitions despite being sent off twice in the space of five days in March 1994. United also reached the League Cup final but lost 3\u20131 to Aston Villa, managed by Ferguson's predecessor, Ron Atkinson. In the FA Cup final, Manchester United achieved an impressive 4\u20130 scoreline against Chelsea, winning Ferguson his second League and Cup Double, following his Scottish Premier Division and Scottish Cup titles with Aberdeen in 1984\u201385, though the League Cup final defeat meant that he had not yet achieved a repeat of the treble that he had achieved with Aberdeen in 1983.\nFerguson made only one close-season signing, paying Blackburn \u00a31.2\u00a0million for David May. There were newspaper reports that Ferguson was also going to sign highly rated 21-year-old striker Chris Sutton from Norwich City, but the player headed for Blackburn instead. 1994\u201395 was a harder season for Ferguson. Cantona assaulted a Crystal Palace supporter in a game at Selhurst Park, and it seemed likely he would leave English football. An eight-month ban saw Cantona miss the final four months of the season. He also received a 14-day prison sentence for the offence but the sentence was quashed on appeal and replaced by a 120-hour community service order. United paid a British record fee of \u00a37\u00a0million for Newcastle United's prolific striker Andy Cole, with young winger Keith Gillespie heading to the north-east in exchange. The season also saw the breakthrough of young players Gary Neville, Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes, who provided excellent cover for the long periods that United were left without some of their more experienced stars. However, the championship slipped out of Manchester United's grasp as they drew 1\u20131 with West Ham United on the final day of the season, when a win would have given them a third successive league title. United also lost the FA Cup final in a 1\u20130 defeat by Everton.\n1995\u201398.\nFerguson was heavily criticised in the summer of 1995 when three of United's star players were allowed to leave and replacements were not bought. First Paul Ince moved to Internazionale of Italy for \u00a37.5\u00a0million, long-serving striker Mark Hughes was sold to Chelsea in a \u00a31.5\u00a0million deal, and Andrei Kanchelskis was sold to Everton. Ferguson felt that United had a number of young players who were ready to play in the first team. The youngsters, who would be known as \"Fergie's Fledglings\", included Gary Neville, Phil Neville, David Beckham, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt, who would all go on to be important members of the team. And so the 1995\u201396 season began without a major signing, at a time when the likes of Arsenal, Liverpool and Newcastle were making the headlines with big-money signings.\nA youthful United team lost 3\u20131 in their opening league game of the 1995\u201396 season, against Aston Villa. On \"Match of the Day\", pundit Alan Hansen criticised their performance, ending his analysis with the words, \"You can't win anything with kids.\" United won their next five matches and were boosted by the return of Cantona, who made his comeback against Liverpool in October 1995. For much of the season, the team trailed league leaders Newcastle and found themselves ten points behind by Christmas; this later was narrowed to seven points after defeating them on 27 December 1995. The gap increased to 12 points, but a series of wins, coupled with Newcastle dropping points, meant by late March, United moved to the top of the table. In a televised outburst after his team's win against Leeds, Newcastle manager Kevin Keegan responded angrily to Ferguson's comments: \"We're still fighting for this title, and he's got to go to Middlesbrough... I would love it if we beat them, love it.\" A win against Middlesbrough on the final day sealed the title for United and the team beat Liverpool by a goal to nil to win the 1996 FA Cup Final; this was their second double in three years. A week after the cup final, Ferguson agreed a four-year contract to remain at United.\nUnited started the following season thrashing the previous year's league runners-up Newcastle 4-0 in the Charity Shield. They went on to win their fourth league title in five seasons at the end of the 1996\u201397 campaign, made easier by the fact that their rivals were \"not up to the job\". Under Ferguson, the team made a better go in the Champions League and reached the semi-final stage for the first time in 28 years. United did not advance any further, after defeat by Borussia Dortmund of Germany. Norwegian signings Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r and Ronny Johnsen were the notable additions to the squad, with the former ending the season as the club's top goalscorer. In May 1997, Cantona informed Ferguson of his decision to retire from football. The player \"felt exploited by United's merchandising department\" and questioned the ambition of the club, reasons which Ferguson understood. Striker Teddy Sheringham was signed as Cantona's replacement from Tottenham Hotspur, with Blackburn defender Henning Berg the other significant purchase that summer. In the close season, United appointed Keane as their new captain. Ferguson described him as \"the best all-round player in the game\" after the team's 1997 FA Charity Shield win and believed Keane had \"all the right ingredients\" to succeed from Cantona.\nDefeat by Leeds United in September 1997 was the team's first league loss in seven months; Keane during the match injured himself and was subsequently ruled out for the rest of the season with ligament damage. Goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel was placed as captain in his absence. By November, United opened up a four-point lead in the league, which prompted talk of whether any team could catch them. After Arsenal's defeat of United in the same month, Ferguson acknowledged a one-horse race was \"not good for the game\" and admitted his opponents \"...\u00a0deserved to win on their second-half performance\". The fallibilities of Liverpool, Chelsea and Blackburn as league challengers allowed United during the winter to extend their lead by 11 points, albeit with Arsenal having games-in-hand. This was enough for Manchester bookmaker Fred Done to pay out on punters who backed the champions retaining their title.\nArsenal collected maximum points, sealing the title with a win against Everton on 3 May 1998. Ferguson congratulated his opponent Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, who in his first full season at the club, later completed the double: \"I think it's good for my young players to lose on this occasion. I wholeheartedly acknowledge what Arsenal achieved between Christmas and the end of the season.\" United straight after paid \u00a310.75\u00a0million for PSV defender Jaap Stam, a new club record fee. Ferguson wanted to strengthen the squad's attacking options and identified Aston Villa's Dwight Yorke as his main target. Attempts to sign Yorke were rebuffed at first, before Ferguson persuaded Edwards to increase United's initial offer of \u00a310\u00a0million. A \u00a312.6\u00a0million deal was reached a week into the league campaign; Yorke signed minutes before the deadline to submit United's squad for the Champions League.\n1998\u201399: Treble success.\nUnited opened the 1998\u201399 season with a 3\u20130 loss to Arsenal in the 1998 FA Charity Shield. The beating did not concern Ferguson, though he described his team's defeat by Arsenal in September 1998 as \"a lot less tolerable\". In December 1998, Kidd left his role as assistant to become the manager of Blackburn Rovers. Ferguson instructed Eric Harrison and Les Kershaw to find suitable replacements, \"in terms of coaching ability and work ethic.\" Both recommended Steve McClaren, the assistant to Jim Smith at Derby County. McClaren was Ferguson's initial choice and appointed him in February 1999. His first game as assistant was United's 8\u20131 victory over Nottingham Forest.\nFerguson felt United's bid to regain the Premier League began indifferently because of their commitments to other competitions. He was willing to \"pay for the progress\" made in the Champions League; the team finished second in their Champions League \"group of death\", behind Bayern Munich and ahead of Barcelona. United's win against Liverpool in the FA Cup fourth round was a portent for the remainder of the season. A goal down after three minutes, the team equalised in the 86th minute and scored the winning goal through Solskj\u00e6r in stoppage time. On reflection, Ferguson said it was \"a demonstration of the morale that was to be every bit as vital as rich skill in the five months that lay ahead of United\".\nIn the final weeks of the league season, Arsenal emerged as a credible challenger to United. Both clubs were also paired together in the semi-final of the FA Cup, decided by a replay as the original game finished goalless. Keane was sent off in the second half and United conceded a penalty late into the match with the score 1\u20131. Dennis Bergkamp's effort was saved by Peter Schmeichel. Ferguson hoped his team \"could at least take it to a penalty shoot-out\", but instead the match was settled in extra time: Giggs ran the length of the pitch and evaded several Arsenal players to score the winning goal. United went on to beat Newcastle United in the FA Cup final and completed the double \u2013 a week earlier the team had regained the Premiership title.\nUnited's progression in the Champions League was promising compared to previous seasons. The team eliminated Inter Milan at the quarter-final stage and faced Juventus in the last four of the competition. A late goal scored by Giggs in the first leg earned the team a 1\u20131 draw, but in spite of conceding an away goal, Ferguson was adamant of United's chances of reaching the final: \"...\u00a0something tells me we are going to win. The nature of our club is that we torture ourselves so much that the only way to get relief is by winning over there.\" At the Stadio delle Alpi, striker Filippo Inzaghi scored twice to put Juventus 3\u20131 up on aggregate. Keane headed in a Beckham cross to halve the deficit just before half-time, but was later shown a yellow card for a foul on Edgar Davids, which prevented him from playing in the final. Yorke equalised, before Cole added a third to win the match outright. Keane's performance merited praise from Ferguson:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDays after the FA Cup final, United travelled to Barcelona, the setting for the UEFA Champions League final. Ferguson contemplated his team selection against Bayern Munich; suspensions to Scholes and Keane ruled both players out of the match. Beckham was positioned in centre midfield, while Giggs moved to the right wing and Blomqvist started on the left \u2013 changes the manager felt would prevent the opposition from playing narrow. United conceded in the first six minutes of the final, from a Mario Basler's free kick. Sheringham, who came on for Blomqvist, equalised from a corner in the first minute of additional time. McClaren told Ferguson to get the team organised for extra time, to which he replied, \"Steve, this game isn't finished.\" Three minutes into added time, Solskj\u00e6r scored the winner, which for United completed an unprecedented treble. Ferguson, interviewed moments after, said, \"I can't believe it. Football, bloody hell. But they never gave in and that's what won it.\" He and Schmeichel, the stand-in captain, jointly lifted the cup during the trophy presentation.\nA crowd of over 500,000 people turned out on the streets of Manchester to greet the players, who paraded through the city in an open-top bus. As European champions, United were invited to play in the Intercontinental Cup. The club also entered the inaugural Club World Championship, which was held in Brazil. This brought about a potential fixture congestion so United accepted the FA's recommendation of withdrawing from the FA Cup, the first holders to do so. In later years, Ferguson elaborated on the club's decision: \"We did it to help England's World Cup bid. That was the political situation. I regretted it because we got nothing but stick and terrible criticism for not being in the FA Cup when really, it wasn't our fault.\"\n1999\u20132002: Title hat-trick, retirement plan.\nSchmeichel's decision to leave United after eight seasons prompted Ferguson to bring in replacements: Mark Bosnich from Aston Villa and Italian Massimo Taibi. The latter featured in four matches, the last of which a 5\u20130 defeat at Chelsea in October 1999; he was not selected again by Ferguson. United ended the 1999\u20132000 league season as champions, with just three defeats and a record points margin of 18. In December 1999, the club beat Palmeiras in Tokyo to win the Intercontinental Cup, but a month later exited at the group stage of the inaugural Club World Championship, although Ferguson stated the tournament was \"fantastic\". United failed to retain the Champions League, as they lost in the quarter-final stage to eventual winners Real Madrid. Ferguson sought to strengthen his squad and signed Fabien Barthez from Monaco for \u00a37.8\u00a0million. He also monitored the progress of Ruud van Nistelrooy, \"a striker of the highest calibre\". He met the player and his agent in Manchester to discuss formalities and was informed of Van Nistelrooy's troubled right knee. Ferguson was not agitated by this; he recalled from experience a similar niggle that did not stop his playing career. Van Nistelrooy, however, failed his medical, but Ferguson reassured him that \"we might yet find a way out of the nightmare\". The deal was resurrected in April 2001 for a British record transfer fee of \u00a319\u00a0million.\nIn the 2000\u201301 season, United retained the league title for a third season, becoming only the fourth side in history to do so. The achievement was overshadowed by reports of a rift between the club's board and Ferguson. He told the club's television channel MUTV that he was prepared to sever all ties with the club, once his contract ended the following year: \"The decision has been taken. I'm going to leave the club. I'm disappointed with what has happened because I was hoping something would be sorted out. It hasn't happened as I thought it would and that's all there is to it.\" Both parties eventually reached a compromise which pleased Ferguson: \"I am delighted we've settled this. When you have been at the club as long as I have it gets in your blood.\" Age was one of the factors in Ferguson's decision to retire: reaching 60 acted as a \"psychological barrier ... It changed my sense of my own fitness, my health.\"\nIn May 2001, McClaren left to become Middlesbrough manager, with Jimmy Ryan being named assistant to Ferguson for the duration of the campaign. United once more broke their transfer record with the purchase of Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n from Lazio for a reported \u00a328.1\u00a0million. In August 2001, Stam was transferred to Lazio for \u00a316\u00a0million. The player reportedly moved because of claims in his autobiography \"Head to Head\"; Stam implied that Ferguson illegally contacted him about a move to Manchester United, before informing PSV. Ferguson said he sold the player because the club needed to cut back on its \"massive wage bill\". He replaced the defender with Laurent Blanc, a long sought-after target. In an interview with Alastair Campbell eight years after, Ferguson described his biggest mistake at the club was \"letting go of Jaap Stam. No question\".\nThe club endured a poor first half to the season and languished in ninth position after a home defeat by West Ham in December 2001. On the night of Christmas Day, Ferguson shelved his retirement plan. His family convinced him to remain in charge of United and Ferguson informed Watkins of his u-turn the following day.\nOnce Ferguson publicised his decision to remain in February 2002, United's form improved. The team won 13 out of 15 matches, though finished third in the league behind Arsenal and Liverpool. United were unsuccessful in Europe, losing their Champions League semi-final on away goals to Bayer Leverkusen. Early exits from the League Cup and FA Cup meant they ended the season trophyless. Ferguson himself said that the decision to announce his retirement had resulted in a negative effect on the players and on his ability to impose discipline.\n2002\u20132006: Rebuilding and transition.\nIn June 2002, Ferguson appointed Carlos Queiroz as his new assistant. The recommendation came from Andy Roxburgh, at a time when United began scouting for southern-hemisphere footballers and wanted a multilingual coach. Ferguson was so impressed with Queiroz after their first meeting, he offered him the job \"right away\". In July 2002, United paid \u00a329.3 million for Leeds United defender Rio Ferdinand. The club broke the British transfer record once more, though this did not concern Ferguson: \"We have the right to try and improve ourselves and there's nothing wrong with that.\"\nThe 2002\u201303 season began rather poorly for United; the club made their worst start to a league campaign in 13 years. In a column for \"The Daily Telegraph\", Hansen said Ferguson \"will recognise this difficult start to the season for what it is: the greatest challenge of his career\". Ferguson's response was typically bullish:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I don't get paid to panic. We have had plenty of stuttering starts. My greatest challenge is not what's happening at the moment. My greatest challenge was knocking Liverpool right off their fucking perch. And you can print that.\nSeveral players were sent away for surgery in this period, a \"minor gamble\" Ferguson took in the hope they would return energised. Defeats, such as the one to Manchester City at Maine Road in November 2002, forced United to change their playing style. The team \"moved the ball forward more and quicker rather than concentrating on possession ratios\", and the coaching staff tried accommodating Diego Forl\u00e1n with Ruud van Nistelrooy, before settling with Paul Scholes. United's league form improved as the season went on despite defeat by Liverpool in the 2003 Football League Cup Final and they overhauled Arsenal to win the Premier League for an eighth time in May 2003. The team were eliminated in the Champions League quarter-final to Real Madrid over two legs; Ferguson described the second match, a 4\u20133 win at Old Trafford as \"epic\".\nAfter a season at United, Queiroz left to manage Real Madrid in June 2003. Ferguson anticipated his deputy would return \u2013 \"Three months later, he was wanting to quit Madrid\" \u2013 and for that reason did not appoint a replacement. In the summer, David Beckham also moved to Real Madrid, while Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n joined Chelsea. United in the meantime rebuilt their team: Tim Howard replaced Barthez in goal and Kl\u00e9berson, Eric Djemba-Djemba and Cristiano Ronaldo came in to bolster the squad. Ronaldinho might have also joined \"had he not said yes, then no, to our offer\".\nIn December 2003, Rio Ferdinand was banned from playing football for eight months after he failed to present himself at a drugs test. Ferguson in his autobiography ten years later blamed the drug testers, who \"...didn't do their job. They didn't go looking for Rio\". The absence of Ferdinand hampered United's defence of the Premier League in the 2003\u201304 season; the team finished third behind Arsenal's \"Invincibles\" and Chelsea. In Europe, they experienced defeat at the hands of eventual winners Porto. Ferguson felt it was possible \"not because of the performance of the players but because of the referee\", who disallowed a legitimate Scholes goal that would have been enough to progress. United ended the campaign as FA Cup winners, beating Millwall 3\u20130 in the 2004 final.\nAt the beginning of the 2004\u201305 season, teenage striker Wayne Rooney (the world's most expensive teenager at more than \u00a320\u00a0million) and Argentine defender Gabriel Heinze joined United while Cristiano Ronaldo continued where he had left off the previous season by putting in more match-winning performances. But the lack of a striker after Ruud van Nistelrooy spent most of the season injured saw the club finish third for the third time in four seasons. In the 2004\u201305 FA Cup, they lost on penalties to Arsenal in the final. A second-round exit from the Champions League at the hands of Milan and a semi-final exit from the League Cup at the hands of eventual winners Chelsea (who also clinched the Premier League title) meant that 2004\u201305 was a rare instance of a trophyless season for United. During the season, Ferguson managed his 1,000th game in charge of United in a 2\u20131 home win against Lyon.\nFerguson's preparations for the 2005\u201306 season were disrupted by a high-profile dispute with major shareholder John Magnier, over the ownership of the racehorse Rock of Gibraltar. When Magnier and business partner J. P. McManus agreed to sell their shares to American business tycoon Malcolm Glazer, it cleared the way for Glazer to acquire full control of the club. This sparked violent protests from United fans, and disrupted Ferguson's plans to strengthen the team in the transfer market. In spite of this, United looked to solve their goalkeeping and midfield problems. For this, they signed the Dutch goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar from Fulham and Korean star Park Ji-sung from PSV.\nThe season was one of transition. On 18 November, Roy Keane officially left the club, his contract ended by mutual consent. United failed to qualify for the knock-out phase of the UEFA Champions League. In the January transfer window, Serbian defender Nemanja Vidi\u0107 and French full-back Patrice Evra were signed, and the side finished in second place in the league, behind runaway winners Chelsea. Winning the League Cup was a consolation prize for lack of success elsewhere. Ruud van Nistelrooy's future at Old Trafford was in doubt after not starting in the League Cup final, and he departed at the end of the season.\nBefore the start of the new season, Ferguson received much criticism, particular in the guise of an article in \"The Guardian\" titled \"Shredding his legacy at every turn\".\nSecond Champions League trophy.\nIn 2006, Michael Carrick was signed to take Roy Keane's place in the team for a fee that eventually rose to \u00a318\u00a0million. United started the season well, and for the first time ever won their first four Premier League games, United's best start since 1985. They set the early pace in the Premier League and never relinquished top spot from the tenth match of the 38-game season. The January 2006 signings had a huge impact on United's performances \u2013 Patrice Evra and Nemanja Vidi\u0107 came in to form a solid back line along with Rio Ferdinand and skipper Gary Neville. The signing of Carrick brought stability and further creativity in the United midfield, forming an effective partnership with Paul Scholes. Park Ji-sung and Ryan Giggs both underlined their value to the first team squad by adding significant pace and incisiveness in attack with Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo.\nFerguson celebrated the 20th anniversary of his appointment as manager of Manchester United on 6 November 2006. Tributes also came from Ferguson's players, both past and present, as well as his old foe, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. The party was spoiled the following day when United endured a single-goal defeat at the hands of Southend United in the fourth round of the League Cup. On 1 December it was announced that Manchester United had signed 35-year-old Henrik Larsson on loan, a player that Ferguson had admired for many years, and attempted to capture previously. On 23 December 2006, Cristiano Ronaldo scored the club's 2,000th goal under Ferguson in a match against Aston Villa.\nManchester United subsequently won their ninth Premier League title but were denied a unique fourth double by Chelsea's Didier Drogba scoring a late goal in the FA Cup final at Wembley Stadium. In the Champions League, the club reached the semi-finals, recording a 7\u20131 home win over Roma in the quarter-final second leg, but lost at the San Siro to Milan 3\u20130 in the second leg of the semi-final after being 3\u20132 up from the first leg.\nFor the 2007\u201308 season, Ferguson made notable signings to reinforce United's first team. Long-term target Owen Hargreaves joined from Bayern Munich, young Portuguese winger Nani and Brazilian playmaker Anderson joined soon after, while the last summer signing was West Ham and Argentina striker Carlos Tevez after a complex and protracted transfer saga.\nDespite getting some retribution on Chelsea by beating them in the Community Shield, United suffered their worst start to a league season under Ferguson, drawing their first two league games before suffering a 1\u20130 defeat by local rivals Manchester City. United, however, recovered and began a tight race with Arsenal for the title. After a good run of form, Ferguson claimed that throughout his time at Manchester United, this was the best squad he had managed to assemble thus far.\nOn 16 February 2008, United beat Arsenal 4\u20130 in an FA Cup fifth round match at Old Trafford, but were knocked out by eventual winners Portsmouth in the quarter-final on 8 March, losing 1\u20130 at home. United having had a penalty claim turned down, Ferguson alleged after the game that Keith Hackett, general manager of the Professional Game Match Officials Board, was \"not doing his job properly\". Ferguson was subsequently charged by The FA with improper conduct, which he decided to contest. This was the second charge Ferguson faced in the season, following his complaints against the referee after United lost 1\u20130 at Bolton Wanderers\u00a0\u2013 a charge he decided not to contest.\nOn 11 May 2008, Ferguson led Manchester United to a tenth Premier League title, exactly 25 years to the day after he led Aberdeen to European glory against Real Madrid in the Cup Winners' Cup. Nearest rivals Chelsea\u00a0\u2013 level on points going into the final round of matches, but with an inferior goal difference\u00a0\u2013 could only draw 1\u20131 at home to Bolton, finishing two points adrift of the champions. United's title win was sealed with a 2\u20130 win over Wigan Athletic, managed by former United captain Steve Bruce.\nOn 21 May 2008, Ferguson won his second European Cup with Manchester United as they beat Chelsea 6\u20135 on penalties in the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, following a 1\u20131 draw after extra time in the first ever all-English UEFA Champions League Final. A penalty miss from Cristiano Ronaldo meant that John Terry's spot-kick would have given the trophy to Chelsea if successfully converted, but Terry missed his penalty and in the end it was Edwin van der Sar's blocking of a Nicolas Anelka penalty which gave the trophy to Manchester United for the second time under Ferguson and for the third time overall.\nWorld champions and further league titles.\nAlthough the team had a slow start to the 2008\u201309 season, United won the Premier League with a game to spare, making Ferguson the first manager in the history of English football to win the top division three times consecutively, on two separate occasions. Ferguson had now won 11 league titles at Manchester United, and the 2008\u201309 season title success put them level with Liverpool as league champions on a record 18 occasions in total. They also won the League Cup on penalties after a goalless draw in the final against Tottenham, after becoming the first British club to win the FIFA Club World Cup in December 2008.\nThey contested the Champions League final against Barcelona on 27 May 2009 but lost 2\u20130, thus failed to defend the trophy.\nIn 2009\u201310 season, Ferguson added another League Cup to his honours list as United defeated Aston Villa 2\u20131 in the final on 28 February 2010, United's first ever successful knockout cup defence. However, his dreams of a third European Cup were ended a few weeks later when United were edged out of the competition in the quarter-finals by Bayern Munich on away goals. And their hopes of a record 19th league title were ended on the last day of the season when Chelsea beat them to the Premier League title by one point, crushing Wigan Athletic 8\u20130 and rendering United's 4\u20130 win over Stoke City meaningless.\nHe ended the following season by winning his 12th and Manchester United's 19th league title and thus overtaking Liverpool's record of 18. Manchester United faced Barcelona again on 28 May 2011 in the 2011 Champions League final, their third in four years, but United lost 3\u20131. Analyst Alan Hansen stated that he believed Ferguson was \"the key component\" in United's success that season, so key in fact that \"[he] would have claimed the crown with any of the other top sides had he been in charge of them\". With Edwin van der Sar, Gary Neville and Paul Scholes all retiring in 2011, Ferguson spent big by signing defender Phil Jones from Blackburn and winger Ashley Young from Aston Villa for around \u00a317\u00a0million each, and goalkeeper David de Gea from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid for around \u00a319\u00a0million.\nThe following season United managed to beat rivals Manchester City in the 2011 FA Community Shield and eliminated them in the FA Cup third round, but ended the season below City, who won their first Premier League title on goal difference. This bitter and slim defeat prompted Ferguson to sign star-striker Robin van Persie, who was the Premier League Golden Boot title-holder, from another arch-rival Arsenal on 17 August 2012.\nThe 2012\u201313 season saw Ferguson guide United to become league champions for the 20th time, claiming the title with a 3\u20130 home win over Aston Villa on 22 April 2013 with four matches to spare; Van Persie scored all the goals with a first half hat-trick en route to retain the Golden Boot. His final game in charge, his 1,500th in total, saw United play out a 5\u20135 draw with West Bromwich Albion. The result meant United finished the season 11 points ahead of runners-up Manchester City. Earlier in the season, on 2 September 2012, Ferguson managed his 1,000th league game with United playing against Southampton. United won the game 3\u20132 thanks to another hat-trick from Van Persie. Two weeks later, he won his 100th game in the Champions League with a 1\u20130 win over Galatasaray at Old Trafford.\nRetirement.\nOn 8 May 2013, Ferguson announced that he had decided to retire as manager at the end of the football season, but would remain at the club as a director and club ambassador. \"The Guardian\" announced it was the \"end of an era\", while UEFA president Michel Platini referred to Ferguson as \"a true visionary\". Former Manchester United players Paul Ince and Bryan Robson agreed that Ferguson would be \"a hard act to follow\". Manchester United co-chairman Joel Glazer said, \"His determination to succeed and dedication to the club have been truly remarkable.\" Ferguson revealed that he had in fact decided that he was going to retire back in December 2012 and that it had been very difficult not to reveal his plans. Ferguson's announcement of his decision to retire saw United's shares fall 5% on the New York Stock Exchange.\nOn 9 May 2013, Manchester United announced Everton manager David Moyes would replace Ferguson as the club manager from 1 July, having signed a six-year contract. In Ferguson's final match in charge, Manchester United drew 5\u20135 at West Bromwich Albion, a hat-trick from Romelu Lukaku, later a United player, denying Ferguson a final victory.\nFerguson released his second autobiography in October 2013 called \"\". In January 2014, Ferguson was appointed as the UEFA Coaching Ambassador, and said it was \"an honour and a privilege\" to be given the role. In April 2014, it was announced that Ferguson would be taking up a \"long-term teaching position\" at Harvard University, where he would be lecturing on a new course titled \"The Business of Entertainment, Media and Sports\". This came six months after he revealed his blueprint for success was included in the \"Harvard Business Review\" in a series of interviews with Anita Elberse. His book, \"Leading: Learning from Life and My Years at Manchester United\", was published in collaboration with billionaire venture capitalist, author and former journalist Michael Moritz in August 2015.\nControversies.\nGordon Strachan.\nGordon Strachan was a key player for Ferguson at Aberdeen, but their relationship broke down when Strachan signed an agreement with German club FC K\u00f6ln without telling Ferguson. Ferguson said that he believed although \"there was a cunning streak in Strachan, I had never imagined that he could pull such a stroke on me\". Strachan did not sign for K\u00f6ln, but instead moved to Manchester United in the summer of 1984. Strachan liked the move because he felt that Ron Atkinson treated him as an adult, unlike Ferguson. Strachan was still with the club when Ferguson was appointed manager in November 1986. Ferguson thought that Strachan did not play for United with the same confidence he had in Scotland and subsequently sold him to Leeds United in 1989. Strachan enjoyed significant success with Leeds as a veteran player, helping them win the 1991\u201392 English league championship in a title race with Ferguson's United.\nTheir relationship continued to be frosty as Strachan moved into management himself. In his 1999 autobiography, Ferguson stated that Strachan \"could not be trusted an inch \u2013 I would not want to expose my back to him in a hurry\". Strachan's reaction to the attack, in his own autobiography, \"My Life in Football\", was one of being \"surprised and disappointed\", although he suspected that Ferguson had helped to relegate Strachan's Coventry City in 2001 by fielding a weakened Manchester United team in a match against Derby County. By 2006 they appeared to have \"declared something of a truce\", ahead of Champions League matches between United and Strachan's Celtic.\nDavid Beckham.\nIn February 2003, Ferguson was involved in a dressing room argument with Manchester United player David Beckham. Ferguson allegedly kicked a football boot in frustration, which hit Beckham in the face and caused a minor injury. Ferguson apologised to Beckham, who was transferred to Real Madrid later that year.\nChampions League draw fixing.\nOn 5 April 2003, Ferguson claimed that the Champions League draw was fixed in favour of Spanish and Italian teams. UEFA charged Ferguson for bringing the game into disrepute with his comments. Ferguson apologised for his remarks and wrote a letter to UEFA in explanation, but he was fined 10,000 Swiss francs (\u00a34,600) by the governing body.\nRock of Gibraltar.\nIn 2003, Ferguson launched legal action against the then major Manchester United shareholder John Magnier over stud rights for race horse Rock of Gibraltar. Magnier counter-sued Ferguson by filing a \"Motion to Comply\" requiring Ferguson to substantiate his claim for half of Rock of Gibraltar's stud fees. The legal issues were further compounded by Magnier being a significant shareholder in the football club managed by Ferguson at the time. Magnier requested that \"99 Questions\" be answered over Ferguson's transfer dealings, including those of Jaap Stam, Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n, Tim Howard, David Bellion, Cristiano Ronaldo and Kl\u00e9berson. The case was eventually settled out of Court.\nBBC.\nFerguson refused to give interviews to the BBC after a documentary called \"Fergie and Son\" was shown on BBC Three on 27 May 2004. According to an article in \"The Independent\", the documentary had \"portrayed his agent son, Jason, as somebody who exploited his father's influence and position to his own ends in the transfer market\". The same newspaper article made it clear that Jason was never found guilty of any wrongdoing, and it quoted Alex Ferguson as saying: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;They [the BBC] did a story about my son that was whole lot of nonsense. It all [\"sic\"] made-up stuff and 'brown paper bags' and all that kind of carry-on. It was a horrible attack on my son's honour and he should never have been accused of that. Subsequent interviews on BBC programmes such as \"Match of the Day\" were done by his assistants, latterly Mike Phelan.\nUnder new Premier League rules intended for the 2010\u201311 season, Ferguson was required to end his BBC boycott. However, he refused to end his boycott and Manchester United said they would pay the resulting fines. No fines were ever issued, as the BBC hoped to resolve the dispute. On 25 August 2011, Ferguson met with BBC director general Mark Thompson and BBC North director Peter Salmon, after which Ferguson agreed to end his seven-year boycott.\nReferees.\nFerguson has received numerous punishments for abusing and publicly criticising match officials when he has perceived them to be at fault:\n\"Fergie Time\".\nIt has also been suggested that Ferguson's intimidation of referees resulted in so-called \"Fergie Time\": that is, unusually generous injury time being added in matches where Manchester United were behind. The phrase is at least as old as 1998, but the concept first appeared on 10 April 1993 when Steve Bruce scored a 97th-minute goal (seventh minute of injury time added on by the referee) against Sheffield Wednesday to win the game for United: they went top of the league with this win and remained there until the season ended. The term got wider coverage when United came from behind to win the 1999 UEFA Champions League final with two goals in injury time.\nThe concept cropped up in the media (and by opponents) whenever games seemed to be having more injury time than expected. A statistical analysis by \"The Times\" suggests that this concept might be valid, though the article points out that other footballing criteria may explain the correlation between extra added time and United being behind. Analysis by Opta Sports of Premier League matches played between 2010 and 2012 found on average that 79 seconds more time was played in matches where Manchester United were losing. This was a greater figure than for other top clubs, although most of these clubs seem to benefit from a \"Fergie Time\" effect, particularly in their home matches.\nLegacy.\nMany of Ferguson's former players have gone on to become football managers themselves, including Tony Fitzpatrick, Alex McLeish, Gordon Strachan, Mark McGhee, Willie Miller, Neale Cooper, Bryan Gunn, Eric Black, Billy Stark, Bryan Robson, Steve Bruce, Mark Hughes, Roy Keane, Paul Ince, Chris Casper, Mark Robins, Darren Ferguson, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, Henning Berg, Andrei Kanchelskis, Michael Appleton, Ryan Giggs, David Healy, Gabriel Heinze, Paul Scholes, Gary Neville, Jaap Stam, Michael Carrick, Wayne Rooney and Phil Neville. Three of these have subsequently managed Manchester United: Giggs (interim player-manager in 2014), Solskj\u00e6r (2018 to 2021), and Carrick (interim manager in 2021).\nThe phrase \"squeaky-bum time\", coined by Ferguson in reference to the tense final stages of a league competition, was included in the \"Collins English Dictionary\" and the \"Oxford English Dictionary\".\nA bronze statue of Ferguson, designed by Scottish sculptor Philip Jackson, was unveiled outside Old Trafford on 23 November 2012. On 14 October 2013, Ferguson attended a ceremony where a road near Old Trafford was renamed from Water's Reach to Sir Alex Ferguson Way. In July 2021, Aberdeen commissioned sculptor Andy Edwards to sculpt a bronze statue of Ferguson. This was unveiled at Aberdeen's Pittodrie stadium on 25 February 2022, and on the following day Ferguson was presented with a maquette of the statue.\nA documentary about Ferguson's career titled \"\" was released in UK cinemas on 27 May 2021 and was made available on Amazon Prime Video in the UK and Ireland on 29 May. It includes interviews from Ferguson himself, his family, doctors and former players who he managed throughout his career. Ferguson also inspired author Jilly Cooper to write a novel, \"Tackle!,\" based on football.\nPersonal life.\nFerguson lives in Wilmslow, Cheshire, and was married to Cathy Holding from 1966 until her death in October 2023. They had three sons together: Mark (born 1968); and twins Darren, who was also a professional footballer and currently the manager of Peterborough United; and Jason (born 1972), who runs an events management company. Jason directed the 2021 documentary \"\" about his father.\nIn 1991, Ferguson became a wine collector after being shown a display of bottles from Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem and Ch\u00e2teau P\u00e9trus while in Montpellier, France. In 2014, he put part of his vast collection up for auction with Christie's, with their head of wine David Elswood describing his taste as \"exceptional\", valued at up to \u00a33 million. After the first of three auctions, Ferguson had sold 229 lots for \u00a32.2 million.\nFerguson underwent an emergency surgery on 5 May 2018, after having a brain haemorrhage. He made a recovery from the surgery and attended his first match at Old Trafford since then on 22 September 2018.\nPolitical involvement.\nA self-described socialist and a lifelong supporter of the Labour Party, Ferguson is a personal friend of Tony Blair's political strategist Alastair Campbell and was enthusiastic about New Labour's 1997 electoral victory. He was in regular phone contact with Campbell during the 1997 campaign, offering his views and advice. In 1998, Ferguson was named in a list of the Labour Party's biggest private financial donors. He later defended New Labour's record and praised Gordon Brown's handling of the 2008 global financial crisis.\nIn January 2011 Graham Stringer, a Labour MP in Manchester and Manchester United supporter, called for Ferguson to be made a life peer. Stringer and fellow Manchester Labour MP Paul Goggins repeated this call after Ferguson announced his retirement in May 2013.\nIn the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, Ferguson supported Scotland remaining in the United Kingdom. He criticised the Scottish Government and First Minister Alex Salmond for denying the vote to Scots living in the UK but outside Scotland. He also objected to the self-imposed rule by the Yes Scotland campaign against accepting donations from people living outside Scotland of more than \u00a3500, which they urged the No campaign to also adopt.\nFerguson met with Keir Starmer at Old Trafford ahead of the 2024 United Kingdom general election, and endorsed Labour Party's Davy Russell during his successful 2025 Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse by-election campaign to win the seat from the Scottish National Party.\nCharitable work.\nAfter retiring from managing Manchester United in 2013, Ferguson continued to serve as an ambassador and director for the club. In October 2024, it was announced that at the end of the season he will leave his official role as club ambassador.\nAs well as having an ambassadorial role at Manchester United and other public speaking and charity engagements in retirement, he is a long-term patron of his childhood team Harmony Row, including a successful campaign for the club to have new facilities (they are now based at Braehead).\nIn July 2025 Ferguson was announced as an official ambassador for the Glasgow\u2011based dementia charity \"Playlist for Life\", which promotes the use of personally meaningful music in dementia care. The appointment formalised several years of support for the organisation, including fundraising activities and public advocacy. In 2024 he had shared a personal \u201cplaylist of his life\u201d on \"BBC Breakfast\" to mark National Playlist Day, encouraging others to create their own therapeutic playlists. \nHonours.\nPlayer.\nSt Johnstone\nFalkirk\nIndividual\nManager.\nFerguson was made an Inaugural Inductee of the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002 in recognition of his impact on the English game as a manager. In 2003, Ferguson became an inaugural recipient of the FA Coaching Diploma, awarded to all coaches who had at least ten years' experience of being a manager or head coach. He is the Vice-President of the National Football Museum, based in Manchester, and a member of the Executive Committee of the League Managers Association. On 5 November 2011, the Old Trafford North Stand was officially renamed the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand in honour of his 25 years as manager of Manchester United.\nIn addition to being the only manager to win the top league honours, and the 'Double', north and south of the England\u2013Scotland border (winning the Premier League with Manchester United, and the Scottish Premier Division with Aberdeen), he is also the last manager to win the Scottish league championship with a non Old Firm team, achieving this in the 1984\u201385 season with Aberdeen.\nFerguson is the second-most decorated manager in European football competitions with seven honours, behind only Carlo Ancelotti. Ferguson won the top division title in England a record 13 times. He is also the first manager in the history of the English league to win three consecutive league titles, which he did twice. Ferguson won 10 Manager of the Year awards, 27 Manager of the Month awards, and managed the most games in the UEFA Champions League (190). In 2017, Ferguson was named among the 10 most influential coaches since the foundation of UEFA in 1954.\nSt Mirren\nAberdeen\nManchester United\nIndividual\nHonorary degrees.\nFerguson has received at least eight honorary degrees.

{"id": "43229", "revid": "41496293", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43229", "title": "The Solent", "text": "Strait separating the Isle of Wight from the mainland of England\nThe Solent ( ) is a strait between the Isle of Wight and mainland Great Britain; the major historic ports of Southampton and Portsmouth lie inland of its shores. It is about long and varies in width between , although the Hurst Spit which projects into the Solent narrows the sea crossing between Hurst Castle and Colwell Bay to just over .\nThe Solent is a major shipping lane for passenger, freight and military vessels. It is also an important recreational area for water sports, particularly yachting, hosting the Cowes Week sailing event annually. It is sheltered by the Isle of Wight and has a complex tidal pattern, which has benefited Southampton's success as a port, providing a \"double high tide\" that extends the tidal window during which deep-draught ships can be handled. Spithead, an area off Gilkicker Point near Gosport, is known as the place where the Royal Navy is traditionally reviewed by the monarch of the day.\nThe area is of great ecological and landscape importance, particularly because of the coastal and estuarine habitats along its edge. Much of its coastline is designated as a Special Area of Conservation. It is bordered by and forms a part of the character of a number of nationally important protected landscapes including the New Forest National Park, and the Isle of Wight AONB.\nIt is sometimes erroneously referred to as the \u201cRiver Solent\u201d, however, the River Solent is actually an extinct river that, during the Pleistocene, was located in southern Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. The Solent itself is not a river \u2013 it is a strait.\nEtymology.\nThe word predates Old English, and is first recorded in 731 as \"Soluente\" (Bede, \"H.E.\" 4, 16). This original spelling suggests a possible derivation from the Brittonic element \"-uente\", which has endured throughout the history of Hampshire, as in the Roman city of Venta Belgarum (Latinised as \"Venta\"), the post-Roman kingdom of Y Went, and the modern name of Winchester.\nIt later appears in Anglo-Saxon records as \"Solentan\".\nA pre-Celtic and supposedly Semitic root meaning \"free-standing rock\" has also been suggested as a possible description of the cliffs marking western approach of the strait. This Semitic origin may be a relic of the Phoenician traders who are believed by some to have sailed to Britain from the Mediterranean as part of the ancient tin trade.\nAn Indo-European root (as opposed to Semitic) is preferred by Richard Coates.\nAnother suggestion is that the name may reflect the number of Northern Gannets (previously known as Solans or the Solan Goose) along the coast.\nGeology.\nOriginally a river valley, the Solent has gradually widened and deepened over many thousands of years. The River Frome was the source of the River Solent, with four other rivers\u2014the Rivers Avon, Hamble, Itchen and Test\u2014being tributaries of it. Seismic sounding has shown that, when the sea level was lower, the River Solent incised its bed to a depth of at least below current Ordnance Datum.\nThe Purbeck Ball Clay contains kaolinite and mica, showing that in the Lutetian stage of the Eocene water from a granite area, probably Dartmoor, flowed into the River Solent.\nSeabed survey shows that when the sea level was lower in the Ice Age the River Solent continued the line of the eastern Solent (Spithead) to a point roughly due east of the east end of the Isle of Wight and due south of a point about west of Selsey Bill, and then south-south-west for about , and then south for about , and then joined the main river flowing down the dry bed of the English Channel.\nDuring the Ice Age, meanders of the Solent's tributaries became incised: for example, an incised meander of the River Test is buried under reclaimed land under the Westquay shopping centre, near Southampton docks;\nSince the retreat of the most recent glaciation, the South East of England, like the Netherlands, has been steadily slowly sinking through historic time due to forebulge sinking.\nIn 2008 a new theory\u2014that the Solent was originally a lagoon\u2014was reported in the \"Southern Daily Echo\" by Garry Momber from the Hampshire and Wight Trust for Maritime Archaeology.\nThe Isle of Wight was formerly contiguous with the Isle of Purbeck in Dorset\u2014the Needles on Wight and Old Harry Rocks on Purbeck are the last remnant of this connection.\nTen thousand years ago a band of relatively resistant chalk rock, part of the Southern England Chalk Formation, ran from the Isle of Purbeck area of south Dorset to the eastern end of Isle of Wight, parallel to the South Downs. Inland behind the chalk were less resistant sands, clays and gravels. Through these weak soils and rocks ran many rivers, from the Dorset Frome in the west and including the Stour, Beaulieu River, Test, Itchen and Hamble, which created a large estuary flowing west to east and into the English Channel at the eastern end of the present Solent. This great estuary ran through a wooded valley and is now referred to as the Solent River.\nWhen glaciers covering more northern latitudes melted at the end of the last ice age, two things happened to create the Solent. Firstly, a great amount of flood water ran into the Solent River and its tributaries, carving the estuary deeper. Secondly, post-glacial rebound after the removal of the weight of ice over Scotland caused the island of Great Britain to tilt about an east\u2013west axis, because isostatic rebound in Scotland and Scandinavia is pulling mantle rock out from under the Netherlands and south England: this is forebulge sinking.\nOver thousands of years, the land sank in the south (a process still continuing) to submerge many valleys creating today's characteristic rias, such as Southampton Water and Poole Harbour, as well as submerging the Solent. The estuary of the Solent River was gradually flooded, and eventually the Isle of Wight became separated from the mainland as the chalk ridge between The Needles on the island and Old Harry Rocks on the mainland was eroded. This is thought to have happened about 7,500 years ago.\nThe process of coastal change is still continuing, with the soft cliffs on some parts of the Solent, such as Fort Victoria, constantly eroding, whilst other parts, such as Ryde Sands, are accreting.\nThe Solent is a comparatively shallow stretch of tidal water. It has an unusual double tide that is both favourable and hazardous to maritime activities with its strong tidal movements and quickly changing sea states.\nCoupled with the above, the Solent is renowned for its large volume of vessel usage, thus resulting in one of the highest density of declared lifeboat stations in the world. This includes six RNLI (e.g. Calshot and Cowes) and five independently run stations (e.g. Hamble Lifeboat and Gosport and Fareham Inshore Rescue Service).\nHistory.\nRemains of human habitation have been found from the prehistoric, Roman, and Saxon eras, showing that humans retreated towards progressively higher ground over these periods. Offshore from Bouldnor, Isle of Wight, divers have found at depth the submerged remains of a wooden building that was built there on land around 6000 BC when the sea level was lower and the land was higher.\nThere is an early Norman period report that much land on the south of Hayling Island was lost to sea flood. South of Hayling Island in the Solent is a deposit of stones, which scuba divers found to be the remains of a stone building, probably a church. There is an old report that this church was formerly in the middle of Hayling Island. If similar amounts of land have been lost on other parts of the Solent shore, the Solent was likely to have been much narrower in Roman times, and it is possible to believe Diodorus Siculus's report that in his time men could wade to the Isle of Wight at low tide.\nIn the early 16th century, Henry VIII of England built an extensive set of coastal defences at each end of the Solent, part of his Device Forts, effectively controlling access to east and west. In 1545, a naval battle was fought in the Solent between English and French naval forces. The battle was inconclusive with no significant losses other than Henry VIII's flagship, the \"Mary Rose\", which foundered and sank while making a sharp turn. From a total crew of over 400 (some estimates have suggested as many as 700), fewer than 35 survived the sinking. The remains of the \"Mary Rose\" were discovered at the bottom of the Solent by a salvage project in 1971 and were successfully salvaged in 1982. The remains of the hull and a large number of artefacts can be seen in the Mary Rose Museum located in the Portsmouth Historic Dockyard.\nIn 1685, King James II narrowly escaped shipwreck while sailing in the Solent. Musician Henry Purcell wrote \"They that go down to the sea in ships\" to be sung by the extraordinary voice of John Gostling in commemoration of this event. More forts were built on land and at sea in the 19th century. These were generally known as Palmerston Forts.\nThe Solent was one of two sites for the sailing events at the 1908 Summer Olympics. The Solent became the departure area of the ill-fated ocean liner, \"Titanic\", in April 1912.\nA bank in the centre of the Solent, Bramble Bank, is exposed at low water at spring tide. This, combined with the unique tidal patterns in the area, makes navigation challenging. There is an annual cricket match on Bramble Bank during the lowest tide of the year, but games are often cut short by rising tide.\nAccording to the BBC, the at Ryde gives a major advantage to hovercraft which can travel right up a beach and the Solent is the only place in Western Europe where there is a regular passenger service. The operator, Hovertravel, claims it is the world's only commercial passenger hovercraft. It celebrated 50 years of operation in 2015.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

When the conditions are right, a distinct green spot is briefly visible above the Sun's upper limb; the green appearance usually lasts for no more than two seconds. Rarely, the green flash can resemble a green ray shooting up from the sunset or sunrise point.\nGreen flashes occur because the Earth's atmosphere can cause the light from the Sun to separate, via wavelength varying refraction, into different colors. Green flashes are a group of similar phenomena that stem from slightly different causes, and therefore, some types of green flashes are more common than others.\nObserving.\nGreen flashes may be observed from any altitude. They usually are seen at an unobstructed horizon, such as over the ocean, but are possible over cloud tops and mountain tops as well. They may occur at any latitude, although at the equator, the flash rarely lasts longer than a second.\nThe green flash also may be observed in association with the Moon and bright planets at the horizon, including Venus and Jupiter. With an unrestricted view of the horizon, green flashes are regularly seen by airline pilots, particularly when flying westwards as the sunset is slowed. If the atmosphere is layered, the green flash may appear as a series of flashes.\nWhile observing at the Vatican Observatory in 1960, D.J.K.\u00a0O'Connell produced the first color photograph of the green flash at sunset.\nExplanation.\nGreen flash occurs because the atmosphere causes the light from the Sun to separate, or refract, into different frequencies. Green flashes are enhanced by mirages, which increase refraction. A green flash is more likely to be seen in stable, clear air, when more of the light from the setting sun reaches the observer without being scattered. One might expect to see a blue flash, since blue light is refracted most of all and the blue component of the sun's light is therefore the last to disappear below the horizon, but the blue is preferentially scattered out of the line of sight, and the remaining light ends up appearing green.\nWith slight magnification, a green rim on the top of the solar disk may be seen on most clear-day sunsets, although the flash or ray effects require a stronger layering of the atmosphere and a mirage, which serves to magnify the green from a fraction of a second to a couple of seconds.\nTypes.\nThe \"green flash\" description relates to a group of optical phenomena, some of which are listed below:\nThe majority of flashes observed are inferior-mirage or mock-mirage effects, with the others constituting only 1% of reports. Some types not listed in the table above, such as the cloud-top flash (seen as the Sun sinks into a coastal fog, or at distant cumulus clouds), are not understood.\nBlue flashes.\nOn rare occasion, the amount of blue light is sufficient to be visible as a \"blue flash\".\nGreen rim.\nAs an astronomical object sets or rises in relation to the horizon, the light it emits travels through Earth's atmosphere, which works as a prism separating the light into different colors. The color of the upper rim of an astronomical object could go from green to blue to violet depending on the decrease in concentration of pollutants as they spread throughout an increasing volume of atmosphere. The lower rim of an astronomical object is always red. A green rim is very thin and is difficult or impossible to see with the naked eye. In usual conditions, a green rim of an astronomical object gets fainter when an astronomical object is very low above the horizon because of atmospheric reddening, but sometimes the conditions are right to see a green rim just above the horizon.\nThe following quote describes what was probably the longest observation of a green rim, which at times could have been a green flash. It was seen on and off for 35 minutes by members of the Richard Evelyn Byrd party from the Antarctic Little America exploration base in 1934:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There was a rush for the surface and as eyes turned southward, they saw a tiny but brilliant green spot where the last ray of the upper rim of the sun hung on the skyline. It lasted an appreciable length of time, several seconds at least, and no sooner disappeared than it flashed forth again. Altogether it remained on the horizon with short interruptions for thirty-five minutes.When it disappeared momentarily it seemed to have been shut off by a tiny spurt, an inequality in the skyline caused by the barrier surface.Even by moving the head up a few inches it would disappear and reappear again and after it had finally disappeared from view it could be recaptured by climbing up the first few steps of the antanea [\"sic\"] post.\nFor the explorers to have seen a green rim on and off for 35 minutes, there must have been some mirage effect present.\nA green rim is present at every sunset, but it is too thin to be seen with the naked eye. Often a green rim changes to a green flash and back again during the same sunset. The best time to observe a green rim is about 10 minutes before sunset. That is too early to use any magnification like binoculars or a telescope to look directly at the Sun without potential harm to the eyes. (Of course, a magnified image might be projected onto a sheet of paper for safe viewing.) As the Sun gets closer to the horizon, the green rim becomes fainter due to atmospheric reddening. According to the above, it is probably correct to conclude that although a green rim is present during every sunset, a green flash is rarer because of the required mirage.\nIn popular culture.\nJules Verne's 1882 novel \"The Green Ray\" helped to popularize the green flash phenomenon.\nThe disappearance of an opal, named the \"Green Flash at Sunset\" for the scientific phenomenon, forms a significant point plot in Victoria Holt's 1976 novel \"The Pride of the Peacock\". The actual phenomenon is referenced several times in the text.\nIn the 1984 film The Island Closest to Heaven Yuichi Fukaya took Mari, the main character to watch the sunset and told about the green flash after the sun sinks into the sea. According to him those people who saw it will be able to find what they are for looking for.\nIn \u00c9ric Rohmer's 1986 film \"The Green Ray\" (French: \"Le rayon vert\"), the main character, Delphine, eavesdrops on a conversation about Jules Verne's novel and the significance of the green flash, eventually witnessing the phenomenon herself in the final scene.\nIn \"Arthur's New Year's Eve\" from the first season of \"Arthur\" in 1996, Arthur Read, having never stayed up until midnight on New Year's Eve before, talks with his friends about what happens when the New Year comes. Despite not actually having stayed up themselves, they each share their take on the matter, Prunella Deegan telling him that there is an amazing green flash at midnight, but if it doesn't happen, then it has to stay the same year for another whole year.\nIn 2002, the City of San Diego installed an art piece titled \"The Green Flash\" by Malcolm Jones next to the beach boardwalk in Mission Beach. The acrylic and concrete work also includes a plaque that describes the scientific phenomenon. \nWalt Disney Pictures' 2007 movie \"\" references the green flash as a signal that a soul had returned from the dead.\nThe episode \"Trials and Determinations!\" of references the green flash when Ash's Rockruff evolves into Dusk Form Lycanroc after witnessing a green flash at sunset.\nIn 2025, the film \"Dora and the Search for Sol Dorado\" depicted the green flash, as a signal one believes is given by his closed one after death. Dora waits for her grandfather's signal, and she finally sees it one day after her successful adventure, prompting another adventure.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "43236", "revid": "3022076", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43236", "title": "Unicorn", "text": "Legendary single-horned horse-like creature\nThe unicorn is a legendary creature that has been described since antiquity as a beast with a single large, pointed, spiraling horn projecting from its forehead.\nIn European literature and art, the unicorn has for the last thousand years or so been depicted as a white horse- or goat-like animal with a long straight horn with spiraling grooves, cloven hooves, and sometimes a goat's beard. In the Middle Ages and Renaissance, it was commonly described as an extremely wild woodland creature, a symbol of purity and grace, which could be captured only by a virgin. In encyclopedias, its horn was described as having the power to render poisoned water potable and to heal sickness. In medieval and Renaissance times, the tusk of the narwhal was sometimes sold as a unicorn horn.\nA bovine type of unicorn is thought by some scholars to have been depicted in seals of the Bronze Age Indus Valley civilization, the interpretation remaining controversial. An equine form of the unicorn was mentioned by the ancient Greeks in accounts of natural history by various writers, including Ctesias, Strabo, Pliny the Younger, Aelian, and Cosmas Indicopleustes. The Bible also describes an animal, the re'em, which some translations render as \"unicorn\".\nThe unicorn continues to hold a place in popular culture. It is often used as a symbol of fantasy or rarity. In the 21st century, it has become an LGBTQ symbol.\nHistory.\nIndus Valley civilization.\nA creature with a single horn, conventionally called a unicorn, is the most common image on the soapstone stamp seals of the Bronze Age Indus Valley civilization (\"IVC\"), from the centuries around 2000 BC. It has a body more like a cow than a horse, and a curved horn that goes forward, then up at the tip. The mysterious feature depicted coming down from the front of the back is usually shown; it may represent a harness or other covering. Typically, the unicorn faces a vertical object with at least two stages; this is variously described as a \"ritual offering stand\", an incense burner, or a manger. The animal is always in profile on Indus seals, but the theory that it represents animals with two horns, one hiding the other, is disproved by a (much smaller) number of small terracotta unicorns, probably toys, and the profile depictions of bulls, where both horns are clearly shown. It is thought that the unicorn was the symbol of a powerful \"clan or merchant community\", but may also have had some religious significance.\nIn South Asia, the unicorn is only seen during the IVC period, and disappeared in South Asian art after this. Jonathan Mark Kenoyer stated the IVC \"unicorn\" has no \"direct connection\" with later unicorn motifs observed in other parts of the world; nonetheless, it remains possible that the IVC unicorn had contributed to later myths of fantastical one-horned creatures in West Asia.\nClassical antiquity.\nUnicorns are not found in Greek mythology, but rather in the accounts of natural history, for Greek writers of natural history were convinced of the reality of unicorns, which they believed lived in India, a distant and fabulous realm for them. The earliest description is from Ctesias, who in his book \"Indika\" (\"On India\") described them as wild asses, fleet of foot, having a horn a cubit and a half () in length, and colored white, red and black. Unicorn meat was said to be too bitter to eat.\nCtesias got his information while living in Persia. Unicorns or, more likely, winged bulls, appear in reliefs at the ancient Persian capital of Persepolis in Iran. Aristotle must be following Ctesias when he mentions two one-horned animals, the oryx (a kind of antelope) and the so-called \"Indian ass\" (). Antigonus of Carystus also wrote about the one-horned \"Indian ass\". Strabo says that in the Caucasus there were one-horned horses with stag-like heads. Pliny the Elder mentions the oryx and an Indian ox (perhaps a greater one-horned rhinoceros) as one-horned beasts, as well as \"a very fierce animal called the monoceros which has the head of the stag, the feet of the elephant, and the tail of the boar, while the rest of the body is like that of the horse; it makes a deep lowing noise, and has a single black horn, which projects from the middle of its forehead, two cubits [] in length.\" In \"On the Nature of Animals\" (, ), Aelian, quoting Ctesias, adds that India produces also a one-horned horse (iii. 41; iv. 52), and says (xvi. 20) that the () was sometimes called (), which may be a form of the Arabic , meaning 'rhinoceros'.\nCosmas Indicopleustes, a 6th-century Greek traveler who journeyed to India and the Kingdom of Aksum, gives a description of a unicorn based on four bronze figures he saw in the four-towered palace of the King of Ethiopia. He states, from report: They speak of him as a terrible beast and quite invincible and that all its strength lies in its horn. When he finds himself pursued by many hunters and on the point of being caught, he springs up to the top of some precipice whence he throws himself down and in the descent turns a somersault so that the horn sustains all the shock of the fall, and he escapes unhurt.\nMiddle Ages and Renaissance.\nMedieval knowledge of unicorns stemmed from biblical and ancient sources, and unicorns were variously represented as a kind of wild ass, goat, or horse.\nSeveral European medieval travelers claimed to have seen unicorns in their travels outside of Europe. For example Felix Fabri claimed to have seen a unicorn in Sinai.\nThe predecessor of the medieval bestiary, compiled in Late Antiquity and known as (), popularized an elaborate allegory in which a unicorn, trapped by a maiden (representing the Virgin Mary), stood for the Incarnation. As soon as the unicorn sees her, it lays its head on her lap and falls asleep.160 This became a basic emblematic tag that underlies medieval notions of the unicorn, justifying its appearance in both secular and religious art. The unicorn is often shown hunted, raising parallels both with vulnerable virgins and sometimes the Passion of Christ. The myths refer to a beast with one horn that can only be tamed by a virgin; subsequently, some writers translated this into an allegory for Christ's relationship with the Virgin Mary.\nThe unicorn also figured in courtly terms: for some 13th-century French authors such as Thibaut of Champagne and Richard de Fournival, the lover is attracted to his lady as the unicorn is to the virgin. With the rise of humanism, the unicorn also acquired more orthodox secular meanings, emblematic of chaste love and faithful marriage. It plays this role in Petrarch's \"Triumph of Chastity\", and on the reverse of Piero della Francesca's portrait of Battista Strozzi, paired with that of her husband Federico da Montefeltro (painted c. 1472\u201374), Bianca's triumphal car is drawn by a pair of unicorns.\nHowever, when the unicorn appears in the medieval legend of \"Barlaam and Josaphat\", ultimately derived from the life of the Buddha, it represents death, as the \"Golden Legend\" explains.184 Unicorns in religious art largely disappeared after they were condemned by Molanus after the Council of Trent.305\nThe unicorn, tamable only by a virgin woman, was well established in medieval lore by the time Marco Polo described them as \"scarcely smaller than elephants. They have the hair of a buffalo and feet like an elephant's. They have a single large black horn in the middle of the forehead... They have a head like a wild boar's... They spend their time by preference wallowing in mud and slime. They are very ugly brutes to look at. They are not at all such as we describe them when we relate that they let themselves be captured by virgins, but clean contrary to our notions.\" It is clear that Marco Polo was describing a rhinoceros.\nAlicorn.\nThe horn itself and the substance it was made of was called alicorn, and it was believed that the horn holds magical and medicinal properties. The Danish physician Ole Worm determined in 1638 that the alleged alicorns were the tusks of narwhals. Such beliefs were examined wittily and at length in 1646 by Sir Thomas Browne in his \"Pseudodoxia Epidemica\".\nFalse alicorn powder, made from the tusks of narwhals or horns of various animals, was sold in Europe for medicinal purposes as late as 1741. The alicorn was thought to cure many diseases and have the ability to detect poisons, and many physicians would make \"cures\" and sell them. Cups were made from alicorn for kings and given as a gift; these were usually made of ivory or walrus ivory. Entire horns were very precious in the Middle Ages and were often really the tusks of narwhals.\nEntrapment.\nOne traditional method of hunting unicorns involved entrapment by a virgin.\nIn one of his notebooks Leonardo da Vinci wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The unicorn, through its intemperance and not knowing how to control itself, for the love it bears to fair maidens forgets its ferocity and wildness; and laying aside all fear it will go up to a seated damsel and go to sleep in her lap, and thus the hunters take it.\nThe famous late Gothic series of seven tapestry hangings \"The Hunt of the Unicorn\" are a high point in European tapestry manufacture, combining both secular and religious themes. The tapestries now hang in the Cloisters division of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. In the series, richly dressed noblemen, accompanied by huntsmen and hounds, pursue a unicorn against backgrounds or settings of buildings and gardens. They bring the animal to bay with the help of a maiden who traps it with her charms, appear to kill it, and bring it back to a castle; in the last and most famous panel, \"The Unicorn in Captivity\", the unicorn is shown alive again and happy, chained to a pomegranate tree surrounded by a fence, in a field of flowers. Scholars conjecture that the red stains on its flanks are not blood but rather the juice from pomegranates, which were a symbol of fertility. However, the true meaning of the mysterious resurrected unicorn in the last panel is unclear. The series was woven about 1500 in the Low Countries, probably Brussels or Li\u00e8ge, for an unknown patron. A set of six engravings on the same theme, treated rather differently, were engraved by the French artist Jean Duvet in the 1540s.\nAnother famous set of six tapestries of (\"Lady with the unicorn\") in the Mus\u00e9e de Cluny, Paris, were also woven in the Southern Netherlands before 1500, and show the five senses (the gateways to temptation) and finally Love (\"\" the legend reads), with unicorns featured in each piece. Facsimiles of these unicorn tapestries were woven for permanent display in Stirling Castle, Scotland, to take the place of a set recorded in the castle in a 16th-century inventory.\nA rather rare, late-15th-century, variant depiction of the \"hortus conclusus\" in religious art combined the Annunciation to Mary with the themes of the \"Hunt of the Unicorn\" and \"Virgin and Unicorn\", so popular in secular art. The unicorn already functioned as a symbol of the Incarnation and whether this meaning is intended in many \"prima facie\" secular depictions can be a difficult matter of scholarly interpretation. There is no such ambiguity in the scenes where the archangel Gabriel is shown blowing a horn, as hounds chase the unicorn into the Virgin's arms, and a little Christ Child descends on rays of light from God the Father. The Council of Trent finally banned this somewhat over-elaborated, if charming, depiction, partly on the grounds of realism, as no one now believed the unicorn to be a real animal.\nShakespeare scholars describe unicorns being captured by a hunter standing in front of a tree, the unicorn goaded into charging; the hunter would step aside the last moment and the unicorn would embed its horn deeply into the tree (See annotations of Timon of Athens, Act 4, scene 3, c. line 341: \"wert thou the unicorn, pride and wrath would confound thee and make thine own self the conquest of thy fury\".)\nHeraldry.\nIn heraldry, a unicorn is often depicted as a horse with a goat's cloven hooves and beard, a lion's tail, and a slender, spiral horn on its forehead (non-equine attributes may be replaced with equine ones). Whether because it was an emblem of the Incarnation or of the fearsome animal passions of raw nature, the unicorn was not widely used in early heraldry, but became popular from the 15th century. Though sometimes shown collared and chained, which may be taken as an indication that it has been tamed or tempered, it is more usually shown collared with a broken chain attached, showing that it has broken free from its bondage.\nScotland.\nIn heraldry the unicorn is best known as a symbol of Scotland: the unicorn was believed to be the natural enemy of the lion \u2013 a symbol that the English royals had adopted around a hundred years before Two unicorns supported the royal arms of the King of Scots and Duke of Rothesay, and since the 1707 union of England and Scotland, the royal arms of the United Kingdom have been supported by a unicorn along with an English lion. Two versions of the royal arms exist: that used in Scotland gives more emphasis to the Scottish elements, placing the unicorn on the left and giving it a crown, whereas the version used in England and elsewhere gives the English elements more prominence. John Guillim, in his book; \"A Display of Heraldry\", has illustrated the unicorn as a symbol of power, honor and respect.\nGolden coins known as the unicorn and half-unicorn, both with a unicorn on the obverse, were used in Scotland in the 15th and 16th century. In the same realm, carved unicorns were often used as finials on the pillars of Mercat crosses, and denoted that the settlement was a royal burgh. Certain noblemen such as the Earl of Kinnoull were given special permission to use the unicorn in their arms, as an augmentation of honour. The crest for Clan Cunningham bears a unicorn head.\nQueer culture.\nBy the beginning of the 21st century, unicorns became a queer icon, second only to the rainbow flag, symbolizing queerness.\nThe rainbow flag, created by American artist Gilbert Baker in 1978 as a joyous symbol of the diversity of the queer community, became prominent during the gay rights protests of the 1970s and 1980s. Unicorns, which were intrinsically linked to rainbows since the Victorian era, became a symbol of the queer community.\nThere is no consensus on how the unicorn became a gay icon. Alice Fisher, an editor of Observer Design magazine, notes that the values of a unicorn \u2013 as rare and magical \u2013 have resulted in the word being used with various connotations. However, she argues that the Victorian association between rainbows and unicorns has resulted in unicorns becoming a queer icon.\nWhen directly asked, queer people give different answers about why they have close personal relationships with unicorns. They often relate to one or more of the following aspects: uniqueness, magical quality, elusiveness and gender fluidity.\nQueer individuals tend to relate to the unicorn because of their unique sexual orientation and gender identity. Tracey Anne Duncan, a queer New Orleans journalist, described her connection to unicorns when she watched \"The Last Unicorn\" as a child. In the film, the protagonist believed she was one of a kind throughout her life. Tracey was able to relate to that feeling, even though she did not really know what \"her kind\" was at that time.\nThe unicorn is an imaginary animal that lives in a world of myths and legends. Queer people, whose existence may seem to blur the lines between societal norms of masculinity and femininity, may feel like they do not fully belong in this world. It explains their interests in mythical creatures such as unicorns, mermaids, and fairies.\nSome argue that the gender fluidity of the unicorn makes it a suitable representation of the LGBT community. In ancient myths, the unicorn is portrayed as male, whereas in the modern times, it is depicted as a female creature.\nSimilar animals in religion and myth.\nBiblical.\nAn animal called the \"re'em\" () is mentioned in several places in the Hebrew Bible, often as a metaphor representing strength. The allusions to the \"re'em\" as a wild, untamable animal of great strength and agility, with mighty horn or horns best fit the aurochs (\"Bos primigenius\"); this view is further supported by the Assyrian cognate word \"rimu,\" which is often used as a metaphor of strength, and is depicted as a powerful, fierce, wild mountain bull with large horns. This animal was often depicted in ancient Mesopotamian art in profile, with only one horn visible.\nThe translators of the Authorized King James Version of the Bible (1611) followed the Greek Septuagint (\"monokeros\") and the Latin Vulgate (\"unicornis\") and employed \"unicorn\" to translate \"re'em\", providing a recognizable animal that was proverbial for its untamable nature. The American Standard Version translates this term \"wild ox\" in each case.\nThe classical Jewish understanding of the Bible did not identify the \"Re'em\" animal as the unicorn. However, some rabbis in the Talmud debate the proposition that the \"Tahash\" animal (Exodus 25, 26, 35, 36 and 39; Numbers 4; and Ezekiel 16:10) was a domestic, single-horned kosher creature that existed in Moses' time, or that it was similar to the \"keresh\" animal described in Marcus Jastrow's Talmudic dictionary as \"a kind of antelope, unicorn\".\nChinese mythology.\nThe \"qilin\" (), a creature in Chinese mythology, is sometimes called \"the Chinese unicorn\", and some ancient accounts describe a single horn as its defining feature. However, it is more accurately described as a hybrid animal that looks less unicorn than chimera, with the body of a deer, the head of a lion, green scales and a long forwardly-curved horn. The Japanese version (\"kirin\") more closely resembles the Western unicorn, even though it is based on the Chinese \"qilin\". The Qu\u1ebb Ly of Vietnamese myth, similarly sometimes mistranslated \"unicorn\" is a symbol of wealth and prosperity that made its first appearance during the Duong dynasty, about 600 CE, to Emperor Duong Cao To, after a military victory which resulted in his conquest of T\u00e2y Nguy\u00ean. In November 2012 the History Institute of the DPRK Academy of Social Sciences, as well as the Korea News Service, reported that the Kiringul had been found, which is associated with a kirin ridden by King Dongmyeong of Goguryeo.\nBeginning in the Ming dynasty, the \"qilin\" became associated with giraffes, after Zheng He's voyage to East Africa brought a pair of the long-necked animals and introduced them at court in Nanjing as \"qilin\". The resemblance to the \"qilin\" was noted in the giraffe's ossicones (bony protrusions from the skull resembling horns), graceful movements, and peaceful demeanor.\n\"Shanhaijing\" (117) mentioned the \"Bo\"-horse (), a chimera horse with an ox tail, a single horn, a white body, and a sound like a person calling. The creature was said to live at Honest-head Mountain. Guo Pu in his \"jiangfu\" said that the \"Bo\"-horse was able to walk on water. Another similar creature, also mentioned in \"Shanhaijing\" (80) and said to live in Mount Winding-Centre, was the \"Bo\" (), but it had a black tail, tiger's teeth and claws, devoured leopards and tigers.\nHornless unicorn.\nIn \"The Lady and the Unicorn\" tapestry set of (c.\u20091500), it has been claimed, the \"Taste\" tapestry shows a young unicorn without a horn among the animals in the millefleur background, above the two women.\nThe alabaster burial monument of Henry Manners, 2nd Earl of Rutland shows a hornless unicorn at his feet.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "43240", "revid": "40781349", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43240", "title": "Thomas Telford", "text": "Scottish civil engineer (1757\u20131834)\nThomas Telford (9 August 1757 \u2013 2 September 1834) was a Scottish civil engineer. After establishing himself as an engineer of road and canal projects in Shropshire, he designed numerous infrastructure projects in his native Scotland, as well as harbours and tunnels. Such was his reputation as a prolific designer of highways and related bridges, he was dubbed the 'Colossus of Roads' (a pun on the Colossus of Rhodes), and, reflecting his command of all types of civil engineering in the early 19th century, he was elected as the first president of the Institution of Civil Engineers, a post he held for 14 years until his death. The town of Telford in Shropshire was named after him.\nEarly career.\nTelford was born on 9 August 1757, at Glendinning, a hill farm east of Eskdalemuir Kirk, in the rural parish of Westerkirk, in Eskdale, Dumfriesshire. His father John Telford, a shepherd, died soon after Thomas was born. Thomas was raised in poverty by his mother Janet Jackson (died 1794).\nAt the age of 14, he was apprenticed to a stonemason, and some of his earliest work can still be seen on the bridge across the River Esk in Langholm in Dumfries and Galloway. He worked for a time in Edinburgh and in 1782 he moved to London where, after meeting architects Robert Adam and Sir William Chambers, he was involved in building additions to Somerset House there. Two years later he found work at Portsmouth dockyard and \u2013 although still largely self-taught \u2013 was extending his talents to the specification, design and management of building projects.\nIn 1787, through his wealthy patron William Pulteney, he became Surveyor of Public Works in Shropshire. His projects included renovation of Shrewsbury Castle, the town's prison (during the planning of which he met leading prison reformer John Howard), the Church of St Mary Magdalene, Bridgnorth and another church, St Michael's, in Madeley. Called in to advise on a leaking roof at St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury in 1788, he warned the church was in imminent danger of collapse; his reputation was made locally when it collapsed three days later, but he was not the architect for its replacement.\nAs the Shropshire county surveyor, Telford was also responsible for bridges. In 1790 he designed Montford Bridge carrying the London\u2013Holyhead road over the River Severn at Montford, the first of some 40 bridges he built in Shropshire, including major crossings of the Severn at Buildwas, and Bridgnorth. The bridge at Buildwas was Telford's first iron bridge. He was influenced by Abraham Darby's bridge at Ironbridge, and observed that it was grossly over-designed for its function, and many of the component parts were poorly cast. By contrast, his bridge was wider in span and half the weight, although it now no longer exists. He was one of the first engineers to test his materials thoroughly before construction. As his engineering prowess grew, Telford was to return to this material repeatedly.\nIn 1795, the bridge at Bewdley in Worcestershire was swept away in the winter floods and Telford was responsible for the design of its replacement. The same winter floods saw the bridge at Tenbury also swept away. This bridge across the River Teme was the joint responsibility of both Worcestershire and Shropshire and the bridge has a bend where the two counties meet. Telford was responsible for the repair to the northern (Shropshire) end of the bridge.\nEllesmere Canal.\nTelford's reputation in Shropshire led to his appointment in 1793 to manage the detailed design and construction of the Ellesmere Canal, linking the ironworks and collieries of Wrexham via the north-west Shropshire town of Ellesmere, with Chester, utilising the existing Chester Canal, and then the River Mersey.\nAmong other structures, this involved the spectacular Pontcysyllte Aqueduct over the River Dee in the Vale of Llangollen, where Telford used a new method of construction consisting of troughs made from cast iron plates and fixed in masonry. Extending for over with an altitude of above the valley floor, the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct consists of nineteen arches, each with a span. Being a pioneer in the use of cast-iron for large scaled structures, Telford had to invent new techniques, such as using boiling sugar and lead as a sealant on the iron connections. Canal engineer William Jessop oversaw the project but left the detailed execution of the project in Telford's hands. The aqueduct was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2009.\nThe same period also saw Telford involved in the design and construction of the Shrewsbury Canal. When the original engineer, Josiah Clowes, died in 1795, Telford succeeded him. One of Telford's achievements on this project was the design of Longdon-on-Tern Aqueduct, the cast-iron aqueduct at Longdon-on-Tern, pre-dating that at Pontcysyllte, and substantially bigger than the UK's first cast-iron aqueduct, built by Benjamin Outram on the Derby Canal just months earlier. The aqueduct is no longer in use, but is preserved as a distinctive piece of canal engineering.\nThe Ellesmere Canal was left uncompleted in 1805 because it failed to generate the revenues needed to finance the connecting sections to Chester and Shrewbury. However, alongside his canal responsibilities, Telford's reputation as a civil engineer meant he was constantly consulted on numerous other projects. These included water supply works for Liverpool, improvements to London's docklands and the rebuilding of London Bridge (c. 1800).\nMost notably (and again William Pulteney was influential), in 1801 Telford devised a master plan to improve communications in the Highlands of Scotland, a massive project that was to last some 20 years. It included the building of the Caledonian Canal along the Great Glen and redesign of sections of the Crinan Canal, some of new roads, over a thousand new bridges (including the Craigellachie Bridge), numerous harbour improvements (including works at Aberdeen, Dundee, Peterhead, Wick, Portmahomack and Banff), and 32 new churches.\nTelford also undertook highway works in the Scottish Lowlands, including of new roads and numerous bridges, ranging from a 112\u00a0ft (34\u00a0m) span stone bridge across the Dee at Tongueland in Kirkcudbright (1805\u201306) to the 129\u00a0ft (39\u00a0m) tall Cartland Crags bridge near Lanark (1822).\nIn 1809, Telford was tasked with improving the Howth Road in Dublin, to connect the new harbour at Howth to the city of Dublin as part of wider plan to improve communication between Dublin and London. The milestones that are a feature of this route from Howth to the GPO on O'Connell Street still mark the route. He also drafted the first design of the Ulster Canal. Irish engineer, William Dargan, was trained by Telford.\nTelford was consulted in 1806 by the King of Sweden about the construction of a canal between Gothenburg and Stockholm. His plans were adopted and construction of the G\u00f6ta Canal began in 1810. Telford travelled to Sweden at that time to oversee some of the more important initial excavations.\nMany of Telford's projects were undertaken due to his role as a member of the Exchequer Bill Loan Commission, an organ set up under the Public Works Loans Act 1817 (57 Geo. 3. c. 34), to help finance public work projects that would generate employment.\nThe 'Colossus of Roads'.\nDuring his later years, Telford was responsible for rebuilding sections of the London to Holyhead road, a task completed by his assistant of ten years, John MacNeill; today, much of the route is the A5 trunk road, although the Holyhead Road diverted off the A5 along what is now parts of A45, A41 and A464 through the cities of Coventry, Birmingham and Wolverhampton. Between London and Shrewsbury, most of the work amounted to improvements. Beyond Shrewsbury, and especially beyond Llangollen, the work often involved building a highway from scratch. Notable features of this section of the route include the\nWaterloo Bridge across the River Conwy at Betws-y-Coed, the ascent from there to Capel Curig and then the descent from the pass of Nant Ffrancon towards Bangor. Between Capel Curig and Bethesda, in the Ogwen Valley, Telford deviated from the original road, built by Romans during their occupation of this area.\nOn the island of Anglesey a new embankment across the Stanley Sands to Holyhead was constructed, but the crossing of the Menai Strait was the most formidable challenge, overcome by the Menai Suspension Bridge (1819\u201326). Spanning , this was the longest suspension bridge of the time. Unlike modern suspension bridges, Telford used individually linked iron eye bars for the cables.\nTelford also worked on the North Wales coast road between Chester and Bangor, including another major suspension bridge at Conwy, opened later the same year as its Menai counterpart.\nFurther afield Telford designed a road to cross the centre of the Isle of Arran. Named the 'String road', this route traverses bleak and difficult terrain to allow traffic to cross between east and west Arran avoiding the circuitous coastal route. His work on improving the Glasgow \u2013 Carlisle road, later to become the A74, has been described as \"a model for future engineers.\"\nTelford improved on methods for the building of macadam roads by improving the selection of stone based on thickness, taking into account traffic, alignment and slopes.\nThe punning nickname 'Colossus of Roads' was given to Telford by his friend, the eventual Poet Laureate, Robert Southey.\nIn 1821, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\nThe 'Telford Church'.\nAn Act of Parliament in 1823 provided a grant of \u00a350,000 for the building of up to 40 churches and manses in communities without any church buildings (hence the alternative name: 'Parliamentary Church' or 'Parliamentary Kirk'). The total cost was not to exceed \u00a31500 on any site and Telford was commissioned to undertake the design. He developed a simple church of T-shaped plan and two manse designs \u2013 a single-storey and a two-storey, adaptable to site and ground conditions, and to brick or stone construction, at \u00a3750 each. Of the 43 churches originally planned, 32 were eventually built around the Scottish highlands and islands (the other 11 were achieved by redoing existing buildings). The last of these churches was built in 1830. Some have been restored and/or converted to private use.\nLate career.\nOther works by Telford include the St Katharine Docks (1824\u201328) close to Tower Bridge in central London, where he worked with the architect Philip Hardwick, the Gloucester and Berkeley Ship Canal (today known as the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal), Over Bridge near Gloucester, the second Harecastle Tunnel on the Trent and Mersey Canal (1827), and the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal (today part of the Shropshire Union Canal) \u2013 started in May 1826 but finished, after Telford's death, in January 1835. At the time of its construction in 1829, Galton Bridge was the longest single span in the world. Telford surveyed and planned the Macclesfield Canal, which was completed by William Crosley (or Crossley). He also built Whitstable harbour in Kent in 1832, in connection with the Canterbury and Whitstable Railway with an unusual system for flushing out mud using a tidal reservoir. He also completed the \"Grand Trunk\" after James Brindley died due to being over-worked.\nIn 1820, Telford was appointed the first President of the recently formed Institution of Civil Engineers, a post he held until his death.\nFreemasonry.\nHe was a founder member of Phoenix Lodge, No. 257 (in Portsmouth). Telford designed a room within the George Inn for the lodge. In 1786 he became an affiliate member of Salopian Lodge, No. 262 (Shrewsbury, England).\nTelford's death.\nTelford's young draughtsman and clerk 1830\u201334 George Turnbull in his diary states:\n\"On the 23rd\" [August 1834] \"Mr Telford was taken seriously ill of a bilious derangement to which he had been liable ... he grew worse and worse\" \u2026 [surgeons] \"attended him twice a day, but it was to no avail for he died on the 2nd September, very peacefully at about 5pm. \u2026 His old servant James Handscombe and I were the only two in the house\" [24 Abingdon Street, London] \"when he died. He was never married. Mr Milne and Mr Rickman were, no doubt, Telford's most intimate friends. ... I went to Mr Milne and under his direction \u2026 made all the arrangements about the house and correspondence. ... Telford had no blood relations that we knew of. The funeral took place on the 10th September [in Westminster Abbey]. ... Mr Telford was of the most genial disposition and a delightful companion, his laugh was the heartiest I ever heard; it was a pleasure to be in his society.\"\nThomas Telford was buried in the nave of Westminster Abbey; a statue was erected to him nearby, in St Andrew's Chapel adjoining the north transept.\nThroughout his life Telford had a great affection for his birthplace of Eskdale and its people and in his will left legacies to the two local libraries at Westerkirk and Langholm.\nHonours.\nIn 2011 he was one of seven inaugural inductees to the Scottish Engineering Hall of Fame.\nTelford the poet.\nTelford's reputation as a man of letters may have preceded his fame as an engineer: he had published poetry between 1779 and 1784, and an account of a tour of Scotland with Robert Southey. His will left bequests to Southey (who would later write Telford's biography), the poet Thomas Campbell (1777\u20131844) and to the publishers of the \"Edinburgh Encyclop\u00e6dia\" (to which he had been a contributor).\nGeorge Turnbull states that Telford wrote and gave him a poem:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTurnbull also states:\nHis ability and perseverance may be understood from various literary compositions of after life, such as the articles he contributed to the \"Edinburgh Encyclop\u00e6dia\", such as Architecture, Bridge-building, and Canal-making. Singular to say the earliest distinction he acquired in life was as a poet. Even at 30 years of age he reprinted at Shrewsbury a poem called \"Eskdale\", \u2026 Some others of his poems are in my possession.\nAnother example, later in Telford's life, was \"To Sir John Malcolm on Receiving His Miscellaneous Poems\" (1831).\nBridges designed by Telford.\nTelford designed many bridges and aqueducts during his career. They include:\nPlaces named after Telford.\nTelford is commemorated in the names of many sites:\nAutobiography.\nTelford's autobiography, titled \"The Life of Thomas Telford, Civil Engineer, written by himself\", was published posthumously in 1838.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "43243", "revid": "14694810", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43243", "title": "Religion and sexuality", "text": "The views of the various different religions and religious believers regarding human sexuality range widely among and within them, from giving sex and sexuality a rather negative connotation to believing that sex is the highest expression of the divine. Some religions distinguish between human sexual activities that are practised for biological reproduction (sometimes allowed only when in formal marital status and at a certain age) and those practised only for sexual pleasure in evaluating relative morality.\nSexual morality has varied greatly over time and between cultures. A society's sexual norms\u2014standards of sexual conduct\u2014can be linked to religious beliefs, or social and environmental conditions, or all of these. Sexuality and reproduction are fundamental elements in human interaction and societies worldwide. Furthermore, \"sexual restriction\" is one of the universals of culture peculiar to all human societies.\nAccordingly, most religions have seen a need to address the question of a \"proper\" role for sexuality. Religions have differing codes of sexual morality, which regulate sexual activity or assign normative values to certain sexually charged actions or ideas. Each major religion has developed a moral code covering issues of human sexuality, morality, ethics, etc. These moral codes seek to regulate the situations that can give rise to sexual interest and to influence people's sexual activities and practices.\nAbrahamic religions.\nAbrahamic religions (namely Judaism, Samaritanism, Christianity, the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, and Islam) have traditionally affirmed and endorsed a patriarchal and heteronormative approach towards human sexuality.\nCatholicism in particular favours exclusively penetrative vaginal intercourse between men and women within the boundaries of marriage over all other forms of human sexual activity, including autoeroticism, masturbation, anal sex, oral sex, non-penetrative and non-heterosexual sexual intercourse (all of which have been labeled as \"sodomy\" at various times), believing and teaching that such behaviors are forbidden and considered sinful, and further compared to or derived from the alleged behavior of the residents of Sodom and Gomorrah. However, the status of LGBT people in early Christianity and early Islam is debated.\nBah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith.\nIn the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, sexual relationships are permitted only between a husband and wife, and marriage is emphasized in the faith. Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h, the founder of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, forbade any sexual intercourse outside a heterosexual marriage in his book of laws; the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas. Homosexual sexual relationships and same-sex marriages continue to be prohibited.\nChristianity.\nThe Old Testament and Christianity have historically affirmed and endorsed a patriarchal and heteronormative approach toward human sexuality, favouring exclusively penetrative vaginal intercourse between men and women within the boundaries of marriage over all other forms of human sexual activity, including autoeroticism, masturbation, anal sex, oral sex, non-penetrative and non-heterosexual sexual intercourse (all of which have been labeled as \"sodomy\" at various times), believing and teaching that such behaviors are forbidden because they're considered sinful, and further compared to or derived from the behavior of the alleged residents of Sodom and Gomorrah.\nIn the New Testament, Jesus discussed little about sex, and most of the information about sex comes from the Old Testament and Paul's writings, and some are controversial today.\nSexuality carried out between different sexes, between 2 people (Monogamy, although polygamy is not forbidden) and in particular procreation, is generally understood as the ideal state.\nNew Testament.\nPaul the Apostle stated in 1 Corinthians \"To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is well for them to remain unmarried as I am. But if they are not practising self-control, they should marry. For it is better to marry than to be aflame with passion.\" Importantly, Paul's view of sex is also that it is actually unnecessary for those with certain gifts (presumably \"celibacy\"). Jennifer Wright Knust says Paul framed desire a force Christians gained control over whereas non-Christians were \"enslaved\" by it. Further, Paul says the bodies of Christians were members of Christ's body and thus sexual desire must be eschewed.\nNew Testament scholar N. T. Wright asserts that Paul absolutely forbade fornication, irrespective of a new Christian's former cultural practices. Wright notes \"If a Corinthian were to say, 'Because I'm a Corinthian, I have always had a string of girl-friends I sleep with, that's part of our culture,' Paul would respond, 'Not now you're a Christian you don't.'... When someone disagreed with Paul's clear rules on immorality or angry disputes, the matters he deals with in Colossians 3.5\u201310, he is... firm, as we see dramatically in 1 Corinthians 5 and 6. There is no place in the Christian fellowship for such practices and for such a person.\"\nSome have suggested that Paul's treatment of sex was influenced by his conviction that the end of the world was imminent. Under this view, Paul, believing that the world would soon end, took it as a corollary that all earthly concerns, including sex, should hold little interest for Christians. Paul's letters show far greater concern with sexual issues than the gospel writers attributed to Jesus, since Paul was building Christian communities over decades and responding to various issues that arose.\nEarly Christianity.\nIn early Christianity, reflection on scriptural texts introduced an eschatological hermeneutic to the reading of the Book of Genesis. The Garden of Eden was seen as a normative ideal state to which Christians were to strive; writers linked the future enjoyment of Heaven to the original blessedness of Adam and Eve in their reflections.\nThe valuation of virginity in the ancient church brought into relief a tension between the Genesis injunction to \"be fruitful and multiply\" with its understood contextual implication of marriage as a social institution, and the interpretation of the superiority of virginity over marriage, sexual activity and family formation from the Gospel texts https://, https://. One way patristic thinkers tried to harmonize the texts was through the position that there had actually been no sexual intercourse in Eden: on this reading, sex happened after the fall of man and the expulsion from Eden, thus preserving virginity as the perfect state both in the historical Paradise and the anticipated Heaven. John Chrysostom, Gregory of Nyssa, Justin Martyr, Epiphanius of Salamis, and Irenaeus of Lyons all espoused this view:\nProf. John Noonan suggests that \"if one asks... where the Christian Fathers derived their notions on marital intercourse \u2013 notions which have no express biblical basis \u2013 the answer must be, chiefly from the Stoics\". He uses texts from Musonius Rufus, Seneca the Younger, and Ocellus Lucanus, tracing works of Clement of Alexandria, Origen and Jerome to the works of these earlier thinkers, particularly as pertaining to the permissible use of the sexual act, which in the Stoic model must be subdued, dispassionate, and justified by its procreative intent.\nAugustine of Hippo had a different challenge: to respond to the errors of Manichaeism. The Manichees, according to Augustine, were \"opposed to marriage, because they are opposed to procreation which is the purpose of marriage\". \"The method of contraception practised by these Manichees whom Augustine knew is the use of the sterile period as determined by Greek medicine\", which Augustine condemns (this stands in contrast to the contemporarily permitted Catholic use of Natural family planning). Elaine Pagels says, \"By the beginning of the fifth century, Augustine had actually declared that spontaneous sexual desire is the proof of\u2014and penalty for\u2014universal original sin\", though that this view goes against \"most of his Christian predecessors\".\nAs monastic communities developed, the sexual lives of monks came under scrutiny from two theologians, John Cassian and Caesarius of Arles, who commented on the \"vices\" of the solitary life. \"Their concerns were not with the act of masturbation, but with the monks who vowed chastity. The monks' vow made masturbation an illicit act; the act itself was not considered sinful... In fact... prior to Cassian, masturbation was not considered a sexual offence for anyone.\"\nCatholicism.\nFrom the beginning of the thirteenth century, the Catholic Church formally recognized marriage between a freely consenting, baptized man and woman as a sacrament \u2013 an outward sign communicating a special gift of God's love. The Council of Florence in 1438 gave this definition, following earlier church statements in 1208, and declared that sexual union was a special participation in the union of Christ in the church. However the Puritans, while highly valuing the institution, viewed marriage as a \"civil\", rather than a \"religious\" matter, being \"under the jurisdiction of the civil courts\". This is because they found no biblical precedent for clergy performing marriage ceremonies. Further, marriage was said to be for the \"relief of concupiscence\" as well as any spiritual purpose.\nThe Catholic moral theologian Charles E. Curran stated \"the fathers of the Church are practically silent on the simple question of masturbation\".\nThe \"Catechism of the Catholic Church\" teaches that \"the flesh is the hinge of salvation\". The \"Catechism\" indicates that sexual relationships in marriage is \"a way of imitating in the flesh the Creator's generosity and fecundity\" and lists fornication as one of the \"offenses against chastity\", calling it \"an intrinsically and gravely disordered action\" because \"use of the sexual faculty, for whatever reason, outside of marriage is essentially contrary to its purpose\". The \"conjugal act\" aims \"at a deeply personal unity, a unity that, beyond union in one flesh, leads to forming one heart and soul\" since the marriage bond is to be a sign of the love between God and humanity.\nPope John Paul II's first major teaching was on the theology of the body, presented in a series of lectures by the same name. Over the course of five years he elucidated a vision of sex that was not only positive and affirming but was about redemption, not condemnation. He taught that by understanding God's plan for physical love we could understand \"the meaning of the whole of existence, the meaning of life.\" He taught that human beings were created by a loving God for a purpose: to be loving persons who freely choose to love, to give themselves as persons who express their self-giving through their bodies. Thus, sexual intercourse between husband and wife is a symbol of their total mutual self-donation.\nFor John Paul II, \"The body, and it alone, is capable of making visible what is invisible: the spiritual and divine.\" He says there is no other more perfect image of the unity and communion of God in mutual love than the sexual act of a married couple, whereby they give themselves in a total way \u2013 exclusively to one another, and up to the end of their lives, and in a fruitfully generous way by participating in the creation of new human beings. Through this perspective, he understands the immorality of extra-marital sex. It falsifies the language of the human body, a language of total love worthy of persons by using the body for selfish ends, thus treating persons as things and objects, rather than dealing with embodied persons with the reverence and love that incarnate spirits deserve. John Paul II stresses that there is great beauty in sexual love when done in harmony with the human values of freely chosen total commitment and self-giving. For him, this sexual love is a form of worship, an experience of the sacred.\nRoman Catholics believe that masturbation is a sin.\nIn September 2015, the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, responsible for enforcing Catholic doctrine, did not permit a transgender man in Spain to serve as a godfather effectively barring transgender Catholics from serving as a baptismal sponsors. The statement concluded: \"[...] the result is evident that this person does not possess the requisite of leading a life conformed to the faith and to the position of godfather (CIC, can 874 \u00a71,3), therefore is not able to be admitted to the position of godmother nor godfather. One should not see this as discrimination, but only the recognition of an objective absence of the requisites that by their nature are necessary to assume the ecclesial responsibility of being a godparent.\"\nProtestantism.\nViews over sexuality in Protestant churches differ.\nConservative Protestants assert that any and all sex outside of marriage, including that conducted between committed, engaged or cohabiting couples, is the sin of fornication.\nUnlike Roman Catholics, certain Protestants do not disapprove of masturbation due to the lack of a Biblical injunction against the act, including mainline and conservative denominations. Among those Protestants who do not view masturbation as being sinful, there are various restrictions, such as making sure it does not lead to use of pornography or looking lustfully at people or mutual masturbation or addiction to the act. It must also not be undertaken in a spirit of defiance against God.\nLutheran and Reformed churches.\nThe Confessional Lutheran tradition, which includes several denominations worldwide (such as the Lutheran Church \u2013 Missouri Synod) takes a traditional stance towards human sexuality, teaching that \"God created male and female, sexual human beings\". Confessional Lutherans hold that \"Upon creating man and women and the rest of creation, God observed that 'it (was) good,' including the gift of sex.\" The Confessional Lutheran denominations view \"pornography, homosexuality and cohabitation\" as sinful.\nAll 20 Lutheran and Reformed churches of the Evangelical Church in Germany welcome LGBT members, as well as the Protestant Church in the Netherlands. In these Lutheran and Reformed churches gay ministers are permitted in ministry and gay married couples are allowed in their churches.\nInside the Lutheran Church of Sweden, the Bishop of Stockholm, Eva Brunne is a lesbian in a registered partnership with Gunilla Lind\u00e9n, who is also an ordained priest of the Church of Sweden.\nAnglicanism.\nThe Anglican Church upholds human sexuality as a gift from a loving God, designed to be between a man and a woman in a monogamous, lifetime union of marriage. It also recognises singleness and dedicated celibacy as Christ-like. It reassures people with same-sex attraction they are loved by God, and are welcomed as full members of the Body of Christ. The church leadership has a variety of views in regard to homosexual expression and ordination. Some expressions of sexuality are considered sinful, including \"promiscuity, prostitution, incest, pornography, paedophilia, predatory sexual behaviour, and sadomasochism (all of which may be heterosexual and homosexual), adultery, violence against wives, and female circumcision.\" The church is concerned with pressures on young people to engage sexually and encourages abstinence.\nIn the Anglican Church, there is a large discussion over the blessing of gay couples, and over tolerance of homosexuality. The discussion is more about the aspect of love between two people of the same-sex in a relationship than it is about the sexual aspect of a relationship.\nMethodism.\nThe Free Methodist Church teaches:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection teaches: \"We believe that God has commanded that no intimate sexual activity be engaged in outside of marriage between a man and a woman.\" It additionally holds that those who remarry after divorce are living in a state of adultery.\nThe United Methodist Church permits its clergy to officiate same-sex weddings.\nMetropolitan Community Church.\nThe Metropolitan Community Church, also known as the Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches, has a specific outreach to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender families and communities.\nLatter Day Saints movement.\nWithin the many branches of the Latter Day Saints movement, the principal denomination, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), teaches conservative views around sexual ethics in their Law of Chastity, which holds that masturbation, pre- and extra-marital sex, and same-sex sexual activity are sins. In the mid-1800s, however, it was allowed for men to be married to and have children with several women, and this was also discontinued in the late 1800s.\nOn various occasions, LDS Church leaders have taught that members should not masturbate as part of obedience to the LDS law of chastity. The LDS Church believes that sex outside of opposite-sex marriage is sinful, and that any same-sex sexual activity is a serious sin. God is believed to be in a heterosexual marriage with the Heavenly Mother, and Mormons believe that opposite-sex marriage is what God wants for all his children. Top LDS Church leaders formerly taught that attractions to those of the same sex were a sin or disease that could be changed or fixed, but now have no stance on the etiology of homosexuality, and teach that therapy focused on changing sexual orientation is unethical. Lesbian, gay, and bisexual members are, thus, left with the option of attempting to change their sexual orientation, entering a mixed-orientation opposite-sex marriage, or living a celibate lifestyle without any sexual expression (including masturbation).\nThe LDS Church teaches that women's principal role is to raise children. Women who rejected this role as being a domestic woman in the home, were seen as unstable and corrupted. Before 1890, the Mormon leaders taught that polygamy was a way to salvation, and many had multiple wives into the early 1900s, and some women practiced polyandry.\nThe Mormon religion teaches that marriage should be with a man and a woman. The LDS Church teaches its members to obey the law of chastity, which says that \"sexual relations are proper only between a man and a woman who are legally and lawfully wedded as husband and wife.\" Violations of this code include: \"adultery, being without natural affection, lustfulness, infidelity, incontinence, filthy communications, impurity, inordinate affection, fornication.\" The traditional Mormon religion forbids all homosexual behavior, whether it be intra-marriage or extramarital. In Romans 1:24-32, Paul preached to the Romans that homosexual behavior was sinful. In Leviticus 20:13, Moses included in his law that homosexual actions and behaviors were against God's will. In the 1830s, LDS founder, Joseph Smith, instituted the private practice on polygamy. The practice was defended by the church as a matter of religious freedom. In 1890, the church practice was terminated. Since the termination of polygamy, Mormons have solely believed in marriage between two people, and those two people being a man and a woman. The LDS community states that they still love homosexuals as sons and daughters of the Lord, but if they act upon their inclinations, then they are subject to discipline of the church.\nUnitarian Universalism.\nSeveral Unitarian Universalist congregations have undertaken a series of organizational, procedural, and practical steps to become acknowledged as a \"Welcoming Congregation\": a congregation which has taken specific steps to welcome and integrate gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) members. UU ministers perform same-sex unions and now same-sex marriages where legal (and sometimes when not, as a form of civil protest). On June 29, 1984, the Unitarian Universalists became the first major church \"to approve religious blessings on homosexual unions.\"\nUnitarian Universalists have been in the forefront of the work to make same-sex marriages legal in their local states and provinces, as well as on the national level. Gay men, bisexuals, and lesbians are also regularly ordained as ministers, and a number of gay, bisexual, and lesbian ministers have, themselves, now become legally married to their partners. In May 2004, Arlington Street Church was the site of the first state-sanctioned same-sex marriage in the United States. The official stance of the UUA is for the legalization of same-sex marriage\u2014\"Standing on the Side of Love.\" In 2004 UU Minister Rev. Debra Haffner of The Religious Institute on Sexual Morality, Justice, and Healing published \"An Open Letter on Religious Leaders on Marriage Equality\" to affirm same-sex marriage from a multi-faith perspective. In December 2009, Washington, DC Mayor Adrian Fenty signed the bill to legalize same-sex marriage for the District of Columbia in All Souls Church, Unitarian (Washington, D.C.).\nUnitarian Universalists for Polyamory Awareness is a group within Unitarian Universalism whose vision is \"for Unitarian Universalism to become the first poly-welcoming mainstream religious denomination.\"\nIslam.\nInterfaith marriages are recognized between Muslim men and and Non-Muslim women only and not vicecversa , \"People of the Book\" (usually enumerated as Jews, Christians, and Sabians). According to the traditional interpretation of Islamic law (\"shar\u012b\u02bfa\"), a Muslim man is allowed to marry a Christian or Jewish woman, but this ruling does not apply to women who belong to other Non-Muslim religious groups, whereas a Muslim woman is not allowed to marry a Non-Muslim man of any Non-Muslim religious group. In general, the Quran tells Muslim men not to marry Non-Muslim women, and it tells Muslim women not to marry non-Muslim men, but it makes an allowance for Muslim men to marry women of the People of the Book under certain conditions, such as a low amount of Muslim women in their vicinity. Additionally, the non-Muslim wife must be devout in her religion and not be unchaste. Some Muslim scholars discourage all interfaith marriages, citing cultural differences between Muslims and Non-Muslims.\nIn some societies outside the traditional \"dar al-islam\", interfaith marriages between Muslims and Non-Muslims are not uncommon, including marriages that contradict the historic Sunni understanding of \"ijm\u0101\u02bf\" (the consensus of \"fuq\u0101ha\") as to the bounds of legitimacy. The tradition of reformist and progressive Islam, however, permits marriage between Muslim women and Non-Muslim men; Islamic scholars opining this view include Khaleel Mohammed, Hassan Al-Turabi, among others. Despite Sunni Islam prohibiting it, interfaith marriages between Muslim women and Non-Muslim men take place at substantial rates. In the United States, about 10% of Muslim women are today married to Non-Muslim men.\nAttitudes toward LGBTQ+ people and their experiences in the Muslim world have been influenced by its religious, legal, social, political, and cultural history. The religious stigma and sexual taboo associated with homosexuality in Islamic societies can have profound effects for those Muslims who self-identify as LGBTQ+. Today, most LGBTQ-affirming Islamic organizations and individual congregations are primarily based in the Western world and South Asian countries; they usually identify themselves with the liberal and progressive movements within Islam.\nHomosexual acts are forbidden in traditional Islamic jurisprudence and are liable to different punishments, including flogging, stoning, and the death penalty, depending on the situation and legal school. However, homosexual relationships were generally tolerated in pre-modern Islamic societies, and historical records suggest that these laws were invoked infrequently, mainly in cases of rape or other \"exceptionally blatant infringement on public morals\". Public attitudes toward homosexuality in the Muslim world underwent a marked negative change starting from the 19th century through the global spread of Islamic fundamentalist movements such as Salafism and Wahhabism, and the influence of the sexual notions and restrictive norms prevalent in Europe at the time: a number of Muslim-majority countries have retained criminal penalties for homosexual acts enacted under European colonial rule. In recent times, extreme prejudice, discrimination, and violence against LGBT people persists, both socially and legally, in much of the Muslim world, exacerbated by increasingly socially conservative attitudes and the rise of Islamist movements in Muslim-majority countries.\nJudaism.\nIn the perspective of traditional Judaism, sex and reproduction are the holiest of acts one can do, the act through which one can imitate God, and in order to preserve its sanctity there are many boundaries and guidelines. Within the boundaries, there are virtually no outright strictures, and it is in fact obligatory. It prohibits sexual relations outside of heterosexual marriage, maintains biblical strictures on relations within marriage including observance of \"niddah\", a prohibition on relations for a period including the menstrual period, and \"tzniut\", requirements of modest dress and behavior. Traditional Judaism views the physical acts of adultery, incest, intentional waste of semen, the physical act of men having sex with men, and male masturbation as grave sins. Judaism permits relatively free divorce, with Orthodox Judaism and Conservative Judaism requiring a religious divorce ceremony for a divorce to be religiously recognized. Worldwide movements in Judaism considered more liberal have rejected Jewish law as binding but rather inspirational and allegorical, so adapted perspectives more consistent with general contemporary Western culture.\nMost of mainstream Judaism does not accept polyamory, although some people consider themselves Jewish and polyamorous. One prominent rabbi who accepts polyamory is Sharon Kleinbaum, who was ordained in Reconstructionist Judaism, which considers biblical Jewish law as not necessarily binding, but is treated as a valuable cultural remnant that should be upheld unless there is reason for the contrary. She is the senior rabbi at Congregation Beit Simchat Torah in New York which works independently of any major American Jewish denomination. R Kleinbaum states that polyamory is a choice that does not preclude a Jewishly observant, socially conscious life. Some polyamorous Jews also point to biblical patriarchs having multiple wives and concubines as evidence that polyamorous relationships can be sacred in Judaism. There is an email list dedicated to polyamorous Jews, called \"AhavaRaba\", which roughly translates to \"big love\" in Hebrew. (Its name echoes the Ahava rabbah prayer expressing thanks for God's \"abundant love\").\nOrthodox.\nThere are several levels to the observance of physical and personal modesty (\"tzniut\"), according to Orthodox Judaism, as derived from various sources in \"halakha\". Observance of these rules varies from aspirational to mandatory to routine across the spectrum of Orthodox stricture and observance.\nOrthodox Judaism also maintains a strong prohibition on interfaith sexual relations and marriage. Orthodox Judaism, alone of all the Jewish denominations, retains relatively mild traditional disabilities on divorce, including a Biblical prohibition on a Kohen (priestly descendant of Aaron) marrying a divorcee or a woman who has engaged in certain types of sexual misconduct. An Orthodox bill of divorce is required for a divorce to be recognized.\nConservative.\nConservative Judaism, consistent with its general view that halakha (Jewish law) is a binding guide to Jewish life but subject to periodic revision by the Rabbinate, has lifted a number of strictures observed by Orthodox Judaism. In particular, in December 2006, Conservative Judaism's Committee on Jewish Law and Standards adopted \"responsa\" presenting diametrically opposed views on the issue of homosexuality. It adopted an opinion restricting a prior prohibition on homosexual conduct to male-male anal sex only, which it declared to be the only Biblical prohibition, declaring all other prohibitions (e.g. male-male oral sex or lesbian sex) rabbinic, and lifting all rabbinic restrictions based on its interpretation of the Talmudic principle of Kevod HaBriyot (\"human dignity\"). While declining to develop a form of religious gay marriage, it permitted blessing lesbian and gay unions and ordaining openly lesbian and gay rabbis who agree not to engage in male-male anal sex. It is also a traditionalist opinion, upholding all traditional prohibitions on homosexual activity, also adopted as a majority opinion, The approach permits individual rabbis, congregations, and rabbinical schools to set their own policy on homosexual conduct. It reflects a profound change from a prior blanket prohibition on male homosexual practices. It acknowledges a sharp divergence of views on sexual matters within Conservative Judaism, such that there is no single Conservative Jewish approach to matters of sexuality. Conservative Judaism currently straddles the divide between liberal and traditional opinion on sexual matters within contemporary American society, permitting both views.\nConservative Judaism has maintained on its books a variety of requirements and prohibitions, including a requirement that married women observe the family purity laws and a general prohibition on non-marital heterosexual conduct. The family purity laws require women to be recognized as tumah or niddah during their menstrual period. As a tumah, a woman is to wait 7 days for her menstrual cycle to end and then 7 \"clean days\" in order to enter the mikveh and begin sexual relations. During this time, it is forbidden to have any type of contact with the niddah, thus anything she touches is not to be touched and no physical contact is permitted. On the same day as the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards released its homosexuality responsa, it released multiple opinions on the subject of niddah including a responsum lifting certain traditional restrictions on husband-wife contact during the niddah period while maintaining a prohibition on sexual relations. The permissive responsum on homosexuality used the Conservative movement's approach to niddah as an analogy for construing the Biblical prohibition against male homosexual conduct narrowly and lifting restrictions it deemed Rabbinic in nature. The responsum indicated it would be making a practical analogy between an approach in which male homosexual couples would be on their honor to refrain from certain acts and its approach to niddah:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We expect homosexual students to observe the rulings of this responsum in the same way that we expect heterosexual students to observe the CJLS rulings on niddah. We also expect that interview committees, administrators, faculty and fellow students will respect the privacy and dignity of gay and lesbian students in the same way that they respect the privacy and dignity of heterosexual students.\nThe responsum enjoined young people not to be \"promiscuous\" and to prepare themselves for \"traditional marriage\" if possible, while not explicitly lifting or re-enforcing any express strictures on non-marital heterosexual conduct.\nEven before this responsum, strictures on pre-marital sex had been substantially ignored, even in official circles. For example, when the Jewish Theological Seminary of America proposed enforcing a policy against non-marital cohabitation by rabbinical students in the 1990s, protests by cohabiting rabbinical students resulted in a complete rescission of the policy.\nConservative Judaism formally prohibits interfaith marriage and its standards currently indicate it will expel a rabbi who performs an interfaith marriage. It maintains a variety of formal strictures including a prohibition on making birth announcements in synagogue bulletins for children on non-Jewish mothers and accepting non-Jews as synagogue members. However, interfaith marriage is relatively widespread among the Conservative laity, and the Conservative movement has recently adapted a policy of being more welcoming of interfaith couples in the hopes of interesting their children in Judaism.\nConservative Judaism, which was for much of the 20th century the largest Jewish denomination in the United States declined sharply in synagogue membership in the United States the 1990s, from 51% of synagogue memberships in 1990 to 33.1% in 2001, with most of the loss going to Orthodox Judaism and most of the rest to Reform. The fracturing in American society of opinion between increasingly liberal and increasingly traditionalist viewpoints on sexual and other issues, as well as the gap between official opinion and general lay practice vis-a-vis the more traditionalist and liberal denominations, may have contributed to the decline.\nReform, Liberal, Reconstructionist, and Humanistic.\nReform Judaism, Humanistic Judaism, and Reconstructionist Judaism do not observe or require traditional sexuality rules and have welcomed non-married and homosexual couples and endorsed homosexual commitment ceremonies and marriages.\nReform and Reconstructionist Judaism are more tolerant of interfaith partnerships and often explicitly welcome interfaith families at their synagogues and services. Reform and Liberal branches of Judaism do not currently perform religious (and therefore legally binding) marriage ceremonies for interfaith couples; however as of October 2020, Liberal Rabbis may bless an interfaith marriage under a chuppah at their discretion, provided the couple intend to keep a Jewish household. Humanistic Judaism permits interfaith marriage. Reform, Reconstructionist, and Humanistic Judaism also do not require a religious divorce ceremony separate from a civil divorce.\nIt has been speculated that the more tolerant attitudes of Reform, Reconstructionist, and Humanistic Judaism towards both sexual diversity and interfaith marriage may have contributed to the rise in their popularity during the 1990s, from about 33% of affiliated households to 38%, passing Conservative Judaism as the largest Jewish denomination in the United States.\nDharmic religions.\nBuddhism.\nThe most common formulation of Buddhist ethics are the five precepts and the Noble Eightfold Path, which say that one should neither be attached to nor crave sensual pleasure. These precepts take the form of voluntary, personal undertakings, not divine mandate or instruction.\nOf the five precepts, the third vow is to refrain from sex with another's spouse, someone under age (namely, those protected by their parents or guardians), and those who have taken vows of religious celibacy. In Chinese Buddhism, the third vow is interpreted as refraining from sex outside marriage.\nBuddhist monks and nuns of most traditions are expected to refrain from all sexual activity and the Buddha is said to have admonished his followers to avoid unchastity \"as if it were a pit of burning cinders.\" While laypersons may have sex within marriage, monastics are not to have any sexual conduct at all.\nHinduism.\nReligiously, Hindus begin life at the Brahmacharya or \"student\" stage, in which they are directed to chastely advance themselves educationally and spiritually to prepare themselves for a life of furthering their \"dharma\" (societal, occupational, parental, etc. duties) and \"karma\" (right earthly actions); only once they reach the Grihastya or \"householder\" stage can they seek \"kama\" (physical pleasure) and artha (worldly achievement, material prosperity) through marriage and their vocations, respectively.\nAccording to the Dharmasastras or the religious legal texts of Hinduism, marriage in Hinduism is an institution for reproduction and thus is naturally limited to heterosexual couples. Furthermore, sex outside of marriage is prohibited. The Manusmriti list eight types of marriage of which four are consensual and encouraged and four are non-consensual and discouraged. However, popular practices did not necessarily reflect religious teachings.\nThe \"Kama Sutra\" (Discourse on K\u0101ma) by Vatsayana, widely believed to be just a manual for sexual practices, offers an insight into the sexual mores, ethics and societal rules that were prevalent in ancient India. The erotic sculptures of Khajuraho also offer insight. Abhigyana Shakuntalam, a drama in Sanskrit by K\u0101lid\u0101sa, cited as one of the best examples of shringara rasa (romance, one of the nine rasas or emotions), talks of the love story of Dushyanta and Shakuntala.\nSikhism.\nA disciplined Sikh is expected to be in control of sexual desire at all times. \"Kaam\", or \"excessive\" lust, is one of the five thieves, or vices, that interfere with one's spiritual journey. Normal and healthy amounts of sexuality and lust are not condemned nor considered \"kaam\".\nEast Asian religions.\nTaoism.\nIn Chinese mythology, Jiutian Xuann\u00fc is the goddess of war, sex, and longevity. She is closely related to Sun\u00fc (\u7d20\u5973), who is her divine sister. Both their names combined, as \"xuansu zhidao\" (\u7384\u7d20\u4e4b\u9053), signify the Daoist arts of the bedchamber. Most books bearing Jiutian Xuann\u00fc's name were about warfare, but there were a few books that were specifically about sex. The \"Xuann\u00fc Jing\" (\u7384\u5973\u7d93, \"Mysterious Woman Classic\") and the \"Sun\u00fc Jing\" (\u7d20\u5973\u7d93, \"Natural Woman Classic\"), both dating to the Han dynasty, were handbooks in dialogue form about sex. Texts from the \"Xuann\u00fc Jing\" have been partly incorporated into the Sui dynasty edition of the \"Sun\u00fc Jing\". From the Han dynasty onwards, these handbooks would be familiar to the upper class. On the other side, during the Han dynasty, Wang Chong had criticized the sexual arts as \"not only harming the body but infringing upon the nature of man and woman.\" During the Tang dynasty and earlier periods, Jiutian Xuann\u00fc was often associated with the sexual arts. The \"Xuann\u00fc Jing\" remained a familiar work among the literati during the Tang and Sui dynasties.\nThe \"Dongxuanzi Fangzhong Shu\" (\u6d1e\u7384\u5b50\u623f\u4e2d\u8853, \"Bedchamber Arts of the Master of the Grotto Mysteries\"), which was likely written by the 7th-century poet Liu Zongyuan, contains explicit descriptions of the sexual arts that was supposedly transmitted from Jiutian Xuann\u00fc. The sexual practices, that Jiutian Xuann\u00fc supposedly taught, were often compared to alchemy and physiological procedures for prolonging life. In Ge Hong's \"Baopu Zi\", there's a passage in which Jiutian Xuann\u00fc tells Huangdi that sexual techniques are \"like the intermingling of water and fire\u2014it can kill or bring new life depending upon whether or not one uses the correct methods.\"\nTu'er Shen (), The Leveret Spirit is a Chinese Shenist or Taoist deity who manages love and sex between men. His name is often colloquially translated as \"Rabbit God\". Wei-Ming Temple in the Yonghe District of New Taipei City in Taiwan is dedicated to Tu'er Shen. About 9000 pilgrims visit the temple each year to pray to find a suitable partner. The Wei-ming temple also performs love ceremony for gay couples.\nIndigenous religions.\nAfrican Diasporic religions.\nWithin Candombl\u00e9, a syncretic religion primarily found in Brazil, there is widespread (though not universal) support for gay rights, many members are LGBT, and have performed gay marriages. Practitioners of Santer\u00eda, primarily found in Cuba, generally (though not universally) welcome LGBT members and include them in religious or ritual activities. Also a Brazilian syncretic religion, Umbanda houses generally support LGBT rights and have performed gay marriages. Homosexuality is religiously acceptable in Haitian Vodou. The lwa or loa (spirits) Erzulie Dantor and Erzulie Freda are often associated with and viewed as protectors of queer people. The lao Ghede Nibo is sometimes depicted as an effeminate drag queen and inspires those he inhabits to lascivious sexuality of all kinds.\nAncient Mesopotamian religion.\nIndividuals who went against the traditional gender binary were heavily involved in the cult of Inanna, an ancient Mesopotamian goddess. During Sumerian times, a set of priests known as \"gala\" worked in Inanna's temples, where they performed elegies and lamentations. Men who became \"gala\" sometimes adopted female names and their songs were composed in the Sumerian \"eme-sal\" dialect, which, in literary texts, is normally reserved for the speech of female characters. Some Sumerian proverbs seem to suggest that \"gala\" had a reputation for engaging in anal sex with men. During the Akkadian Period, \"kurgarr\u016b\" and \"assinnu\" were servants of Ishtar who dressed in female clothing and performed war dances in Ishtar's temples. Several Akkadian proverbs seem to suggest that they may have also had homosexual proclivities. Gwendolyn Leick, an anthropologist known for her writings on Mesopotamia, has compared these individuals to the contemporary Indian \"hijra.\" In one Akkadian hymn, Ishtar is described as transforming men into women. Some modern pagans include Inanna in their worship.\nPre-colonial religions of the Americas.\nAmong the Indigenous peoples of the Americas prior to the European colonization, many Nations had respected ceremonial, religious, and social roles for homosexual, bisexual, and gender-nonconforming individuals in their communities and in many contemporary Native American and First Nations communities, these roles still exist. Homosexual and gender-variant individuals were also common among other pre-conquest civilizations in Latin America, such as the Aztecs, Mayans, Quechuas, Moches, Zapotecs, and the Tupinamb\u00e1 of Brazil and were accepted in their various religions.\nNew religious movements.\nSince the beginning of the sexual liberation movement in the Western world, which coincided with second-wave feminism and the women's liberation movement initiated in the early 1960s, new religious movements and alternative spiritualities such as Modern Paganism and the New Age began to grow and spread across the globe alongside their intersection with the sexual liberation movement and the counterculture of the 1960s, and exhibited characteristic features, such as the embrace of alternative lifestyles, unconventional dress, rejection of Abrahamic religions and their conservative social mores, use of cannabis and other recreational drugs, relaxed attitude, sarcastic humble or self-imposed poverty, and \"laissez-faire\" sexual behavior. The sexual liberation movement was aided by feminist ideologues in their mutual struggle to challenge traditional ideas regarding female sexuality, male sexuality, and queer sexuality. Elimination of undue favorable bias towards men and objectification of women, as well as support for women's right to choose their sexual partners free of outside interference or societal judgment, were three of the main goals associated with sexual liberation from the feminist perspective.\nModern Paganism.\nMost Neopagan religions have the theme of fertility (both physical and creative/spiritual) as central to their practices, and as such encourage what they view as a healthy sex life, consensual sex between adults, regardless of gender.\nHeathenry, a modern Germanic Pagan movement, includes several pro-LGBT groups. Some groups legitimize openness toward LGBT practitioners by reference to the gender-bending actions of Thor and Odin in Norse mythology. There are, for instance, homosexual and transgender members of The Troth, a prominent U.S. Heathen organisation. Many Heathen groups in Northern Europe perform same-sex marriages, and a group of self-described \"Homo-Heathens\" marched in the 2008 Stockholm Pride carrying a statue of the Norse god Freyr. Research found a greater proportion of LGBT practitioners within Heathenry (21%) than wider society, although noted that the percentage was lower than in other forms of modern Paganism.\nWicca, like other religions, has adherents with a broad spectrum of views, ranging from conservative to liberal. It is a largely nondogmatic religion and has no prohibitions against sexual intercourse outside of marriage or relationships between members of the same sex. The religion's ethics are largely summed up by the Wiccan Rede: \"An it harm none, do as thou wilt\", which is interpreted by many as allowing and endorsing responsible sexual relationships of all varieties. Specifically in the Wiccan tradition of modern witchcraft, one of the widely accepted pieces of Craft liturgy, the Charge of the Goddess instructs that \"...all acts of love and pleasure are [the Goddess'] rituals\", giving validity to all forms of sexual activity for Wiccan practitioners.\nIn the Gardnerian and Alexandrian forms of Wicca, the \"Great Rite\" is a sex ritual much like the hieros gamos, performed by a priest and priestess who are believed to embody the Wiccan God and Goddess. The Great Rite is almost always performed figuratively using the athame and chalice as symbols of the penis and vagina. The literal form of the ritual is always performed by consenting adults, by a couple who are already lovers and in private. The Great Rite is not seen as an opportunity for casual sex.\nRa\u00eblism.\nRa\u00eblism, an international new religious movement and UFO religion which was founded in France in 1974, promotes a positive outlook towards human sexuality, including homosexuality. Its founder Ra\u00ebl recognised same-sex marriage, and a Ra\u00eblian press release stated that sexual orientation is genetic and it also likened discrimination against gay people to racism. Some Ra\u00eblian leaders have performed licensed same-sex marriages.\nSanta Muerte.\nThe cult of Santa Muerte is a new religious movement centered on the worship of Santa Muerte, a cult image, female deity, and folk saint which is popularly revered in Mexican Neopaganism and folk Catholicism. A personification of death, she is associated with healing, protection, and safe delivery to the afterlife by her devotees. Santa Muerte is also revered and seen as a saint and protector of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) communities in Mexico, since LGBTQ+ people are considered and treated as outcasts by the Catholic Church, evangelical churches, and Mexican society at large. Many LGBTQ+ people ask her for protection from violence, hatred, disease, and to help them in their search for love. Her intercession is commonly invoked in same-sex marriage ceremonies performed in Mexico. The Iglesia Cat\u00f3lica Tradicional M\u00e9xico-Estados Unidos, also known as the Church of Santa Muerte, recognizes gay marriage and performs religious wedding ceremonies for homosexual couples. According to R. Andrew Chesnut, PhD in Latin American history and professor of Religious studies, the cult of Santa Muerte is the single fastest-growing new religious movement in the Americas.\nSatanism.\nLaVeyan Satanism is critical of Abrahamic sexual mores, considering them narrow, restrictive and hypocritical. Sex is viewed as an indulgence, but one that should only be freely entered into with consent. The Eleven Satanic Rules of the Earth only give two instructions regarding sex, namely \"Do not make sexual advances unless you are given the mating signal\" and \"Do not harm little children\", although the latter is much broader and encompasses physical and other abuse. This has always been consistent part of Church of Satan policy since its inception in 1966 as Peter H. Gilmore wrote in an essay supporting same sex marriage:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Finally, since certain people try to suggest that our attitude on sexuality is \"anything goes\" despite our stated base principle of \"responsibility to the responsible,\" we must reiterate another fundamental dictate: The Church of Satan's philosophy strictly forbids sexual activity with children as well as with non-human animals.\nSatanists are pluralists, accepting gays, lesbians, bisexuals, BDSM, polyamorists, transgender people, and asexuals. In that essay, he also stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAllegations have been made by antifascist organisations, several British politicians and the media that the Order of Nine Angles condones and encourages sexual abuse, and this has been given as one of the reasons why the O9A should be proscribed by the British government. Many O9A members openly view rape as an effective way to undermine society by transgressing against its norms. White Star Acception commits rapes by their own admission and O9A texts such as \"The Dreccian Way\", \"Iron Gates\", \"Bluebird\" and \"The Rape Anthology\" recommend and praise rape and pedophilia, even suggesting rape is necessary for \"ascension of the Ubermensch\". To advance in rank, ONA member must perform assaults, lynching and sexual assault being the most recommended. Material promoting pedophilia has also appeared in ONA's in house magazine \"Fenrir\". According to BBC News, \"the authorities are concerned by the number of paedophiles associated with the ONA\".\nWestern esotericism and occultism.\nSex magic is a term for various types of sexual activity used in magical, ritualistic, or otherwise religious and spiritual pursuits found within Western esotericism which is a broad spectrum of spiritual traditions found in Western society, or refers to the collection of the mystical, esoteric knowledge of the Western world. One practice of sex magic is using the energy of sexual arousal or orgasm with visualization of a desired result. A premise of sex magic is the concept that sexual energy is a potent force that can be harnessed to transcend one's normally perceived reality. The earliest known practical teachings of sex magic in the Western world come from 19th-century American occultist Paschal Beverly Randolph, under the heading of \"The Mysteries of Eulis\". In the latter part of the 19th century, sexual reformer Ida Craddock published several works dealing with sacred sexuality, most notably \"Heavenly Bridegrooms\" and \"Psychic Wedlock\". Aleister Crowley reviewed \"Heavenly Bridegrooms\" in the pages of his journal \"The Equinox\", stating:\nIt was one of the most remarkable human documents ever produced, and it should certainly find a regular publisher in book form. The authoress of the MS. claims that she was the wife of an angel. She expounds at the greatest length the philosophy connected with this thesis. Her learning is enormous. [...]\nThis book is of incalculable value to every student of occult matters. No Magick library is complete without it.\nAleister Crowley became involved with Theodor Reuss and Ordo Templi Orientis following the publication of \"The Book of Lies\" between 1912 and 1913. According to Crowley's account, Reuss approached him and accused him of having revealed the innermost (sexual) secret of O.T.O. in one of the cryptic chapters of this book. When it became clear to Reuss that Crowley had done so unintentionally, he initiated Crowley into the IX\u00b0 (ninth degree) of O.T.O. and appointed him \"Sovereign Grand Master General of Ireland, Iona and all the Britains.\"\nWhile the O.T.O. included, from its inception, the teaching of sex magick in the highest degrees of the Order, when Crowley became head of the Order, he expanded on these teachings and associated them with different degrees as follows:\nHugh Urban, professor of comparative religion at Ohio State University, noted Crowley's emphasis on sex as \"the supreme magical power\". According to Crowley:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"The Book of the Law\" solves the sexual problem completely. Each individual has an absolute right to satisfy his sexual instinct as is physiologically proper for him. The one injunction is to treat all such acts as sacraments. One should not eat as the brutes, but in order to enable one to do one's will. The same applies to sex. We must use every faculty to further the one object of our existence.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "43245", "revid": "12845131", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43245", "title": "Westminster Abbey", "text": "Church in London, England\nWestminster Abbey, formally titled the Collegiate Church of Saint Peter at Westminster, is an Anglican church in the City of Westminster, London, England. Since 1066, it has been the location of the coronations of 40 English and British monarchs and a burial site for 18 English, Scottish, and British monarchs. At least 16 royal weddings have taken place at the abbey since 1100.\nAlthough the origins of the church are obscure, an abbey housing Benedictine monks was on the site by the mid-10th century. The church got its first large building from the 1040s, commissioned by King Edward the Confessor, who is buried inside. Construction of the present church began in 1245 on the orders of Henry III. The monastery was dissolved in 1559, and the church was made a royal peculiar \u2013 a Church of England church, accountable directly to the sovereign \u2013 by Elizabeth I. The abbey, the Palace of Westminster and St Margaret's Church became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987 because of their historic and symbolic significance.\nThe church's Gothic architecture is chiefly inspired by 13th-century French and English styles, although some sections of the church have earlier Romanesque styles or later Baroque and modern styles. The Henry VII Chapel, at the east end of the church, is a typical example of Perpendicular Gothic architecture; antiquarian John Leland called it \"orbis miraculum\" (\"the wonder of the world\").\nThe abbey is the burial site of more than 3,300 people, many prominent in British history: monarchs, prime ministers, poets laureate, actors, musicians, scientists, military leaders, and the Unknown Warrior. Due to the fame of the figures buried there, artist William Morris described the abbey as a \"National Valhalla\".\nHistory.\nHistorians agree that there was a monastery dedicated to Saint Peter on the site prior to the 11th century, though its exact origin is somewhat obscure. One legend claims that it was founded by the Saxon king S\u00e6berht of Essex, and another claims that its founder was the fictional 2nd-century British king Lucius. One tradition claims that a young fisherman on the River Thames had a vision of Saint Peter near the site. The Fishmongers' Company still gives the abbey a salmon each year in recognition of this story.\nThe origins of the abbey are generally thought to date to about 959, when Dunstan and King Edgar installed a community of Benedictine monks on the site. At that time, the location was an island in the Thames called Thorney Island. This building has not survived, but archaeologists have found some pottery and foundations from this period on the abbey site.\nEdward the Confessor's abbey.\nBetween 1042 and 1052, Edward the Confessor began rebuilding Saint Peter's Abbey to provide himself with a royal burial church. It was built in the Romanesque style and was the first church in England built on a cruciform floorplan. The master stonemason for the project was Leofsi Duddason, with Godwin and Wendelburh Gretsyd (meaning \"fat purse\") as patrons, and Teinfrith as \"churchwright\", probably meaning someone who worked on the carpentry and roofing. Endowments from Edward supported a community that increased from a dozen monks during Dunstan's time, to as many as 80. The building was completed around 1060 and was consecrated on 28December 1065, about a week before Edward's death on 5January 1066. A week later, he was buried in the church; nine years later, his wife Edith was buried alongside him. His successor, Harold Godwinson, was probably crowned here, although the first documented coronation is that of William the Conqueror later that year.\nThe only extant depiction of Edward's abbey is in the Bayeux Tapestry. The foundations still survive under the present church, and above ground, some of the lower parts of the monastic dormitory survive in the undercroft, including a door said to come from the previous Anglo-Saxon abbey. It was a little smaller than the current church, with a central tower.\nIn 1103, thirty-seven years after his death, Edward's tomb was re-opened by Abbot Gilbert Crispin and Henry I, who discovered that his body was still in perfect condition. This was considered proof of his saintliness, and he was canonised in 1161. Two years later he was moved to a new shrine, during which time his ring was removed and placed in the abbey's collection.\nThe abbey became more closely associated with royalty from the second half of the 12th century, as kings increasingly used the nearby Palace of Westminster as the seat of their governments. In 1222, the abbey was officially granted exemption from the Bishop of London's jurisdiction, making it answerable only to the head of the Church itself. By this time, the abbey owned a large swath of land around it, from modern-day Oxford Street to the Thames, plus entire parishes in the City of London, such as St Alban, Wood Street and St Magnus the Martyr, as well as several wharfs.\nOutside London, the abbey owned estates across southeast England, including in Middlesex, Hertfordshire, Essex, Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire. The abbot was also the lord of the manor for the town of Westminster, as a settlement of two to three thousand people grew around the abbey. As a consumer and employer on a grand scale, the abbey helped fuel the town's economy. It also paid for houses and shops to be built in the local area, and gave alms to the local poor.\nHenry III's rebuilding.\nWestminster Abbey continued to be used as a coronation site, but after Edward the Confessor, no monarchs were buried there until Henry III began to rebuild it in the Gothic style. Henry III wanted it built as a shrine to venerate Edward, to match great French churches such as Reims Cathedral and the Sainte-Chapelle, and as a burial place for himself and his family. Construction began on 6July 1245 under Henry's master mason, Henry of Reynes. The first building stage included the entire eastern end, the transepts, and the easternmost bay of the nave. The Lady chapel, built from around 1220 at the extreme eastern end, was incorporated into the chevet of the new building.\nPart of the new building included a rich shrine and chapel to Edward the Confessor, of which the base only still stands. The golden shrine with its jewelled figures no longer exists. 4,000 marks (about \u00a35,800) for this work came from the estate of David of Oxford, the husband of Licoricia of Winchester, and a further \u00a32,500 came from a forced contribution from Licoricia herself, by far the biggest single donation at that time.\nAround 1253, Henry of Reynes was replaced by John of Gloucester, who was replaced by Robert of Beverley around 1260. During the summer, there were up to 400 workers on the site at a time, including stonecutters, marblers, stone-layers, carpenters, painters and their assistants, marble polishers, smiths, glaziers, plumbers, and general labourers. From 1257, Henry III held assemblies of local representatives in Westminster Abbey's chapter house; these assemblies were a precursor to the House of Commons. Henry III also commissioned the Cosmati pavement in front of the High Altar. Further work produced an additional five bays for the nave, bringing it to one bay west of the choir. Here, construction stopped in about 1269. By 1261, Henry had spent over \u00a329,000 on the abbey, and the final sum may have been near \u00a350,000. A consecration ceremony was held on 13October 1269, during which the remains of Edward the Confessor were moved to their present location at the shrine behind the main altar. After Henry's death and burial in the abbey in 1272, construction did not resume and Edward the Confessor's old Romanesque nave remained attached to the new building for over a century.\nIn 1296, Edward I captured the Scottish coronation stone, the Stone of Scone. He had a Coronation Chair made to hold it, which he entrusted to the abbot at Westminster Abbey. In 1303, the small crypt underneath the chapter house was broken into and a great deal of the king's treasure was stolen. It was thought that the thieves must have been helped by the abbey monks, fifty of whom were subsequently imprisoned in the Tower of London.\nCompletion of the Gothic church.\nFrom 1376, Abbot Nicholas Litlyngton and Richard II donated large sums to finish the church. The remainder of the old nave was pulled down and rebuilding commenced, with Richard's mason Henry Yevele closely following the original design even though it was now more than 100 years out of date. During the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, Richard prayed at Edward the Confessor's shrine for \"divine aid when human counsel was altogether wanting\" before meeting the rebels at Smithfield. In the modern day, the abbey holds Richard's full-length portrait, the earliest of an English king, on display near the west door.\nBuilding work was not fully complete for many years. Henry V, disappointed with the abbey's unfinished state, gave extra funds towards the rebuilding. In his will, he left instructions for a chantry chapel to be built over his tomb; the chapel can be seen from ground level. Between 1470 and 1471, because of fallout from the Wars of the Roses, Elizabeth Woodville, the wife of Edward IV, took sanctuary at Westminster Abbey while her husband was deposed, and gave birth to Edward V in the abbot's house. In 1495, building work finally reached the end of the nave, finishing with the west window.\nUnder Henry VII, the 13th-century Lady chapel was demolished and rebuilt in a Perpendicular Gothic style; it is known as the Henry VII Chapel. Work began in 1503 and the main structure was completed by 1509, although decorative work continued for several years afterwards. Henry's original reason for building such a grand chapel was to have a place suitable for the burial of another saint alongside the Confessor, as he planned on having Henry VI, who was buried at Windsor Castle, canonised. The abbey paid \u00a3500 to obtain papal permission to move Henry VI's body, but after Henry VII's death, his son, Henry VIII, gave up on the plan and had his own father buried there instead.\nA view of the abbey dated 1532 shows a lantern tower above the crossing, but this is not shown in any later depiction. It is unlikely that the loss of this feature was caused by any catastrophic event: structural failure seems more likely. Other sources maintain that a lantern tower was never built. The current squat pyramid dates from the 18th century; the painted wooden ceiling below it was installed during repairs to World War II bomb damage.\nIn the early 16th century, a project began under Abbot John Islip to add two towers to the western end of the church. These had been partially built up to roof level when building work stopped due to uncertainty caused by the English Reformation.\nDissolution and Reformation.\nIn the 1530s, Henry VIII broke away from the authority of the Catholic Church in Rome and seized control of England's monasteries, including Westminster Abbey, beginning the English Reformation. In 1535, when the king's officers assessed the abbey's funds, its annual income was \u00a33,000. Henry's agents removed many relics, saints' images, and treasures from the abbey. The golden feretory that housed the coffin of Edward the Confessor was melted down, and monks hid his bones to save them from destruction. The monastery was dissolved and the building became the cathedral for the newly created Diocese of Westminster. The abbot, William Benson, became dean of the cathedral, while the prior and five of the monks were among the twelve newly created canons.\nThe Westminster diocese was dissolved in 1550, but the abbey was recognised (in 1552, retroactively to 1550) as a second cathedral of the Diocese of London until 1556. Money meant for the abbey, which is dedicated to St Peter, was diverted to the treasury of St Paul's Cathedral; this led to an association with the already-old saying \"robbing Peter to pay Paul\".\nThe abbey saw the return of Benedictine monks under the Catholic Mary I, but they were again ejected under Elizabeth I in 1559. In 1560, Elizabeth re-established Westminster as a \"royal peculiar\" \u2013 a church of the Church of England responsible directly to the sovereign, rather than to a diocesan bishop. It was renamed the Collegiate Church of Saint Peter, a non-cathedral church run by the \"Dean and Chapter\"- a dean and several canons. From that date onwards, the building was simply a church, though it was still called an abbey. Elizabeth also re-founded Westminster School, providing for 40 students (the King's (or Queen's) Scholars) and their schoolmasters. The King's Scholars have the duty of shouting \"Vivat Rex\" or \"Vivat Regina\" (\"Long live the King/Queen\") during the coronation of a new monarch. In the modern day, the dean of Westminster Abbey remains the chair of the school governors.\n17th century.\nIn the early 17th century, the abbey hosted two of the six companies of churchmen who produced the King James Version of the Bible. They used the Jerusalem Chamber in the abbey for their meetings. The First Company was headed by the dean of the abbey, Lancelot Andrewes.\nIn 1642, the English Civil War broke out between Charles I and his own parliament. The Dean and Chapter fled the abbey at the outbreak of war, and were replaced by priests loyal to Parliament. The abbey itself suffered damage during the war; altars, stained glass, the organ, and the Crown Jewels were damaged or destroyed. Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell was given an elaborate funeral there in 1658, only for Cromwell's body to be disinterred in January 1661 and posthumously hanged from a gibbet at Tyburn. In 1669, the abbey was visited by the diarist Samuel Pepys, who saw the body of the 15th-century queen Catherine de Valois. She had been buried in the 13th-century Lady chapel in 1437, but was exhumed during building work for the Henry VII Chapel and not reburied in the intervening 150 years. Pepys leaned into the coffin and kissed her on the mouth. In 1878 she was re-interred close to her husband, Henry V. In 1685, during preparations for the coronation of James II, a workman accidentally put a scaffolding pole through the coffin of Edward the Confessor. A chorister, Charles Taylour, pulled a cross on a chain out of the coffin and gave it to the king, who then gave it to the Pope. Its whereabouts are unknown.\n18th and 19th centuries.\nAt the end of the 17th century, the architect Christopher Wren was appointed the abbey's first Surveyor of the Fabric. He began a project to restore the exterior of the church, which was continued by his successor, William Dickinson. After over two hundred years, the abbey's two western towers were built in the 1740s in a Gothic\u2013Baroque style by Nicholas Hawksmoor and John James.\nOn 11 November 1760, the funeral of George II was held at the abbey, and the king was interred next to his late wife, Caroline of Ansbach. He left instructions for the sides of his and his wife's coffins to be removed so that their remains could mingle. He was the last monarch to be buried in the abbey. Around the same time, the tomb of RichardII developed a hole through which visitors could put their hands. Several of his bones went missing, including a jawbone which was taken by a boy from Westminster School and kept by his family until 1906, when it was returned to the abbey.\nIn the 1830s, the screen dividing the nave from the choir, which had been designed by Nicholas Hawksmoor, was replaced by one designed by Edward Blore. The screen contains the monuments to the scientist Isaac Newton and the military general James Stanhope. Further rebuilding and restoration occurred in the 19th century under the architect George Gilbert Scott, who rebuilt sections of the chapter house and north porches, and designed a new altar and reredos for the crossing. His successor, J. L. Pearson, finished the work on the north porches and also reconstructed the northern rose window.\n20th century.\nThe abbey saw \"Prayers For Prisoners\" suffragette protests in 1913 and 1914. Protesters attended services and interrupted proceedings by chanting \"God Save Mrs Pankhurst\" and praying for suffragette prisoners. In one protest, a woman chained herself to her chair during a sermon by the Archbishop of Canterbury. On 11June 1914, a bomb planted by suffragettes of the Women's Social and Political Union exploded inside the abbey. No serious injuries were reported, but the bomb blew off a corner of the Coronation Chair. It also caused the Stone of Scone to break in half, although this was not discovered until 1950 when four Scottish nationalists broke into the church to steal the stone and return it to Scotland.\nIn preparation for bombing raids during World War\u00a0II, the Coronation Chair and many of the abbey's records were moved out of the city, and the Stone of Scone was buried. In 1941, on the night of 10May and the early morning of 11May, the Westminster Abbey precincts and roof were hit by incendiary bombs. Although the Auxiliary Fire Service and the abbey's own fire-watchers were able to stop the fire spreading to the whole of the church, the deanery and three residences of abbey clergy and staff were badly damaged, and the lantern tower above the crossing collapsed, leaving the abbey open to the sky. The cost of the damage was estimated at \u00a3135,000. Some damage can still be seen in the RAF Chapel, where a small hole in the wall was created by a bomb that fell outside the chapel. No one was killed, and the abbey continued to hold services throughout the war. When hostilities ceased, evacuated objects were returned to the abbey, 60,000 sandbags were moved out, and a new permanent roof was built over the crossing. Two different designs for a narthex (entrance hall) for the west front were produced by architects Edwin Lutyens and Edward Maufe during World War II, but neither was built.\nBecause of its outstanding universal value, the abbey was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987, together with the nearby Palace of Westminster and St Margaret's Church.\nIn 1997, the abbey, which was then receiving approximately 1.75\u00a0million visitors each year, began charging admission fees to visitors at the door (although a fee for entering the eastern half of the church had existed prior to 1600).\n21st century.\nIn June 2009, the first major building work in 250 years was proposed. A corona \u2013 a crown-like architectural feature \u2013 was suggested to be built around the lantern over the central crossing, replacing an existing pyramidal structure dating from the 1950s. This was part of a wider \u00a323-million development of the abbey completed in 2013. On 4 August 2010, the Dean and Chapter announced that, \"after a considerable amount of preliminary and exploratory work\", efforts toward the construction of a corona would not be continued.\nThe Cosmati pavement underwent a major cleaning and restoration programme for two years, beginning in 2008. On 17September 2010, Pope Benedict XVI became the first pope to set foot in the abbey when he participated in a service of evening prayer with archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams. On 29April 2011, the abbey hosted the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton.\nIn 2018, the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Galleries were opened. Located in the medieval triforium, high up around the sanctuary, they are areas for displaying the abbey's treasures. A new Gothic access tower with a lift was designed by the abbey architect and Surveyor of the Fabric, Ptolemy Dean.\nIn 2020, a 13th-century sacristy was uncovered in the grounds of the abbey as part of an archaeological excavation. The sacristy was used by the monks of the abbey to store objects used in Mass, such as vestments and chalices. Also on the site were hundreds of buried bodies, mostly of abbey monks. On 10 March 2021, a vaccination centre opened in Poets' Corner to administer doses of COVID-19 vaccines.\nArchitecture.\nThe building is chiefly built in a Geometric Gothic style, using Reigate stone for facings. The church has an eleven-bay nave with aisles, transepts, and a chancel with ambulatory and radiating chapels. The building is supported with two tiers of flying buttresses. The western end of the nave and the west front were designed by Henry Yevele in a Perpendicular Gothic style. The Henry VII Chapel was built in a late Perpendicular style in Huddlestone stone, probably by Robert and William Vertue. The west towers were designed by Nicholas Hawksmoor and blend the Gothic style of the abbey with the Baroque style fashionable during his lifetime.\nThe modern Westminster Abbey is largely based on French Gothic styles, especially those found at Reims Cathedral, rather than the contemporaneous English Gothic styles. For example, the English Gothic style favours large and elaborate towers, while Westminster Abbey did not have any towers until the 18th century. It is also more similar to French churches than English ones in terms of its ratio of height to width: Westminster Abbey has the highest nave of any Gothic church in England, and the nave is much narrower than any medieval English church of a similar height. Instead of a short, square, eastern end (as was the English fashion), Westminster Abbey has a long, rounded apse, and it also has chapels radiating from the ambulatory, which is typical of a French Gothic style. However, there are also distinctively English elements, such as the use of materials of contrasting colours, as with the Purbeck marble and white stone in the crossing.\nThe northern entrance has three porches, with the central one featuring an elaborately carved tympanum, leading it to acquire the nickname \"Solomon's porch\" as a reference to the legendary temple in Jerusalem.\nThe abbey retains its 13th- and 14th-century cloisters, which would have been one of the busiest parts of the church when it was part of a monastery. The west cloister was used for the teaching of novice monks, the north for private study. The south cloister led to the refectory, and the east to the chapter house and dormitory. In the southwest corner of the cloisters is a cellarium formerly used by the monks to store food and wine; in modern times, it is the abbey caf\u00e9. The north cloister and northern end of the east cloister, closest to the church, are the oldest; they date to c.\u20091250, whereas the rest are from 1352 to 1366. The abbey also contains a Little Cloister, on the site of the monks' infirmary. The Little Cloister dates from the end of the 17th century and contains a small garden with a fountain in the centre. A passageway from the Little Cloister leads to College Garden, which has been in continuous use for 900 years, beginning as the medicine garden for the monks of the abbey and now overlooked by canons' houses and the dormitory for Westminster School.\nThe newest part of the abbey is the Weston Tower, finished in 2018 and designed by Ptolemy Dean. It sits between the chapter house and the Henry VII Chapel, and contains a lift shaft and spiral staircase to allow public access to the triforium, which contains the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Galleries. The tower has a star-shaped floorplan and leaded windows with an elaborate crown rooftop. The lift shaft inside is faced with 16 kinds of stone from the abbey's history, including Purbeck marble, Reigate stone, and Portland stone. The project took five years and cost \u00a322.9million. The galleries were designed by McInnes Usher McKnight.\nInterior.\nThe church's interior has Purbeck marble piers and shafting. The roof vaulting is quadripartite, with ridge ribs and bosses and, at , it is one of Britain's highest church vaults. To accommodate as many guests as possible during coronations, the transepts were designed to be unusually long and the choir was placed east (rather than west) of the crossing; this is also seen in Rheims Cathedral. The 13th-century interior would have been painted in bright colours and gilded, although the piers would have been left unpainted.\nAlthough the nave was built over the course of centuries from the east to the west end, generations of builders stuck to the original design and it has a unified style. Markers of the long gap in building between 1269 and 1376 are relatively minor, but can be seen at the fifth bay from the crossing. The spandrels above the arches towards the earlier east end are decorated with diaper-work, and are plain towards the (later) west end. The lancet windows on the earlier side have a foiled circle, and have an unencircled quatrefoil on the later side; the shields on the aisle walls are carved on the earlier side, and painted on the later side. Above the crossing, in the centre of the church, is a roof lantern which was destroyed by a bomb in 1941 and restored by architect Stephen Dykes Bower in 1958. In the choir aisles, shields of donors to the 13th- and 14th-century rebuilding are carved and painted in the spandrels of the arcade. At the eastern end of the nave is a large screen separating the nave from the choir, made of 13th-century stone, reworked by Edward Blore in 1834, and with paintwork and gilding by Bower in the 1960s.\nBehind the main altar is the shrine and tomb of Edward the Confessor. Saints' shrines were once common in English medieval churches, but most were destroyed during the English Reformation and Edward is the only major English saint whose body still occupies his shrine. Arranged around him in a horseshoe shape are a series of tombs of medieval kings and their queens: Henry III, Eleanor of Castile, Edward I, Philippa of Hainault, Edward III, Anne of Bohemia, and Richard II. Henry V is in the centre of the horseshoe, at the eastern end. Henry III's tomb was originally covered with pieces of coloured glass and stone, since picked off by generations of tourists. Above Henry V's tomb, at mezzanine level over the ambulatory, is a chantry chapel built by mason John Thirske and decorated with many sculpted figures (including Henry V riding a horse and being crowned in the abbey). At the western end, the shrine is separated from the main church by a stone reredos which makes it a semi-private space. The reredos depicts episodes from Edward's life, including his birth and the building of the abbey. The shrine is closed to the public, except for special events.\nThe abbey includes side chapels radiating from the ambulatory. Many were originally included in the 13th-century rebuilding as altars dedicated to individual saints, and many of the chapels still bear saints' names (such as St Nicholas and St Paul). Saints' cults were no longer orthodox after the English Reformation, and the chapels were repurposed as places for extra burials and monuments. In the north ambulatory are the Islip Chapel, the Nurses' Chapel (sometimes called the Nightingale Chapel), the Chapel of Our Lady of the Pew, the Chapel of St John the Baptist, and St Paul's Chapel. The Islip Chapel is named after Abbot John Islip, who commissioned it in the 16th century. The screen inside is decorated with a visual pun on his name: an eye and a boy falling from a tree (eye-slip). Additional chapels in the eastern aisle of the north transept are named after (from south to north) St John the Evangelist, St Michael, and St Andrew. The chapels of St Nicholas, St Edmund, and St Benedict are in the south ambulatory.\nThe footprint of the south transept is smaller than the northern one because the 13th-century builders butted against the pre-existing 11th-century cloisters. To make the transepts match, the south transept overhangs the western cloister; this permitted a room above the cloisters which was used to store the abbey muniments. In the south transept is the chapel of St Faith, built c.\u20091250 as the vestry for the abbey's monks. On the east wall is a c.\u20091290\u00a0\u2013 c.\u20091310 painting of St Faith holding the grid-iron on which she was roasted to death.\nChapter house and Pyx Chamber.\nThe octagonal chapter house was used by the abbey monks for daily meetings, where they would hear a chapter of the Rule of St Benedict and receive their instructions for the day from the abbot. The chapter house was built between 1250 and 1259 and is one of the largest in Britain, measuring nearly across. For 300 years after the English Reformation, it was used to store state records until they were moved to the Public Record Office in 1863. It was restored by George Gilbert Scott in the 19th century.\nThe entrance is approached from the east cloister via outer and inner vestibules, and the ceiling becomes higher as a visitor approaches the chapter house. It is an octagonal room with a central pillar, built with a small crypt below. Around the sides are benches for 80 monks, above which are large stained-glass windows depicting the coats of arms of several monarchs and the abbey's patrons and abbots. The exterior includes flying buttresses (added in the 14th century) and a leaded roof designed by Scott. The interior walls of the chapter house are decorated with 14th- and 15th-century paintings of the Apocalypse, the Last Judgement, and birds and animals. The chapter house also has an original, mid-13th-century tiled floor. A wooden door in the vestibule, made with a tree felled between 1032 and 1064, is one of Britain's oldest. It may have been the door to the 11th-century chapter house in Edward the Confessor's abbey, and was re-used as the door to the Pyx Chamber in the 13th century. It now leads to an office.\nThe adjoining Pyx Chamber was the undercroft of the monks' dormitory. Dating to the late 11th century, it was used as a monastic and royal treasury. The outer walls and circular piers also date to the 11th century; several capitals were enriched in the 12th century, and the stone altar was added in the 13th century. The term \"pyx\" refers to the boxwood chest in which coins were held and presented to a jury during the Trial of the Pyx, when newly minted coins were presented to ensure they conformed to the required standards. The chapter house and Pyx Chamber are in the guardianship of English Heritage, but under the care and management of the Dean and Chapter of Westminster.\nHenry VII Chapel.\nThe Henry VII Lady Chapel, also known simply as the Henry VII Chapel, is a large lady chapel at the far eastern end of the abbey which was paid for by the will of King Henry VII. The chapel, built in late Perpendicular Gothic style, inspired English poet John Leland to call it the \"orbis miraculum\" (the wonder of the world). The tombs of several monarchs, including Edward V, Henry VII, Edward VI, Mary I, Elizabeth I, James I, Charles II, George II and Mary, Queen of Scots, are in the chapel.\nIt is noted for its pendant- and fan vault-style ceiling, probably designed by William Vertue, which writer Washington Irving said was \"achieved with the wonderful minuteness and airy security of a cobweb\". The ceiling is not a true fan vault, but a groin vault disguised as a fan vault. The interior walls are densely decorated with carvings, including 95 statues of saints. Many statues of saints in England were destroyed in the 17th century, so these are rare survivors. Like much of the rest of the medieval building, they would originally have been painted and gilded. From outside, The chapel walls are supported from outside by flying buttresses, each in the form of a polygonal tower topped with a cupola. At the centre of the chapel is the tomb of Henry VII and his wife, Elizabeth of York, which was sculpted by Pietro Torrigiano (who fled to England from Italy after breaking Michaelangelo's nose in a fight).\nThe chapel has sub-chapels radiating from the main structure. One, to the north, contains the tombs of Mary I and Elizabeth I; both coffins are in Elizabeth's monument. Another, to the south, contains the tomb of Mary, Queen of Scots. Both monuments were commissioned by James I, Elizabeth's successor to the English throne and Mary's son. At the far eastern end is the RAF Chapel, with a stained-glass window dedicated to those who died in the 1940 Battle of Britain. The RAF Chapel was the original burial site of Oliver Cromwell in 1658. Cromwell was disinterred in 1661, after the Stuart Restoration, when his body was hanged in chains on the gallows at Tyburn.\nThe chapel has been the mother church of the Order of the Bath since 1725, and the banners of its members hang above the stalls. The stalls retain their medieval misericords: small ledges for monks to perch on during services, often decorated with varied and humorous carvings.\nMonastic buildings.\nMany rooms used by the monks have been repurposed. The dormitory became a library and a school room, and the monks' offices have been converted into houses for the clergy. The abbot had his own lodgings, and ate separately from the rest of the monks. The lodgings, now used by the Dean of Westminster, are probably the oldest continuously occupied residence in London. They include the Jericho Parlour (covered in wooden linenfold panelling), the Jerusalem Chamber (commissioned in 1369), and a grand dining hall with a minstrels' gallery which is now used by Westminster School. The prior also had his own household, separate from the monks, on the site of present-day Ashburnham House in Little Dean's Yard (now also part of Westminster School).\nArtworks and treasures.\nThe nave and transepts have sixteen crystal chandeliers made of hand-blown Waterford glass. Designed by A. B. Read and Stephen Dykes Bower, they were donated by the Guinness family in 1965 to commemorate the abbey's 900th anniversary. The choir stalls were designed by Edward Blore in 1848. Some stalls are assigned to high commissioners of countries in the Commonwealth of Nations.\nBeyond the crossing to the west is the sacrarium, which contains the high altar. The abbey has the 13th-century Westminster Retable, thought to be the altarpiece from Henry III's 13th-century church and the earliest surviving English panel painting altarpiece, in its collections. The present high altar and screen were designed by George Gilbert Scott between 1867 and 1873, with sculptures of Moses, St Peter, St Paul, and King David by H. H. Armistead, as well as a mosaic of the Last Supper by J. R. Clayton and Antonio Salviati.\nThe south transept contains wall paintings made c.\u20091300, which Richard Jenkyns calls \"the grandest of their time remaining in England\". Depicting Thomas the Apostle looking at Christ's wounds and St Christopher carrying the Christ Child, the paintings were discovered in 1934 behind two monuments. Fourteenth-century paintings are on the backs of the \"sedilia\" (seats used by priests on either side of the high altar). On the south side are three figures: Edward the Confessor, the angel Gabriel, and the Virgin Mary. On the north side are two kings (possibly Henry III and Edward I) surrounding a religious figure, possibly St Peter. They were walled off during the Commonwealth period by order of Parliament, and were later rediscovered.\nOver the Great West Door are ten statues of 20th-century Christian martyrs of various denominations; the statues were sculpted by the abbey's craftsmen in 1998. Those commemorated are Maximilian Kolbe, Manche Masemola, Janani Luwum, Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna, Martin Luther King Jr., \u00d3scar Romero, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Esther John, Lucian Tapiedi, and Wang Zhiming.\nFrom the chapter house is a doorway leading to the abbey's library, which was built as a dormitory for the monks and has been used as a library since the 16th century. The collection has about 16,000 volumes. Next to the library is the Muniment Room, where the abbey's historic archives are kept.\nCosmati pavement.\nAt the crossing in front of Edward the Confessor's shrine and the main altar is the Cosmati pavement, a 700-year-old tile floor made of almost 30,000 pieces of coloured glass and stone. Measuring almost 25 feet square, coronations take place here.\nThe floor is named after the Cosmati family in Rome, who were known for such work. It was commissioned by Richard Ware, who travelled to Rome in 1258, when he became abbot, and returned with stone and artists. The porphyry used was originally quarried as far away as Egypt, and was presumably brought to Italy during the Roman Empire. It was surrounded by a Latin inscription in brass letters (since lost) identifying the artist as Odericus, probably referring to designer Pietro di Oderisio or his son. The inscription also predicted the end of the world 19,863 years after its creation. Unlike traditional mosaic work, the pieces were not cut to a uniform size but made using a technique known as \"opus sectile\" (\"cut work\"). It is unique among Cosmati floors in Europe for the use of dark Purbeck-marble trays, forming bold borders, instead of the more typical white marble. The pavement influenced later floor treatments at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, and Canterbury Cathedral.\nGeometric designs, such as those in the pavement, were thought to help the abbey's monks with contemplation, and conveyed medieval Christian ideas on the nature of the universe that could not easily be put into words. Much of the design relies on the geometric doubling of the square, considered a trade secret by stonemasons. The four-sided squares, four-fold symmetry, and the four inner roundels of the design represent the four elements of classical philosophy, with the central roundel representing the unformed state of the universe at its creation. Each inner roundel is touched by two bands, which represent the shared qualities of each element; water and air were both considered \"moist\" in classical philosophy, and air and fire were both considered \"hot\".\nStained glass.\nThe abbey's 13th-century windows would have been filled with stained glass, but much of this was destroyed in the English Civil War and the Blitz and was replaced with clear, plain glass. Since the 19th century, new stained glass, designed by artists such as Ninian Comper (on the north side of the nave), Hugh Easton and Alan Younger (in the Henry VII Chapel), has replaced clear glass.\nThe north rose window was designed by James Thornhill and made by Joshua Price in 1722; it shows Christ, the apostles (without Judas Iscariot), the Four Evangelists, and, in the centre, the Bible. The window was restored by J. L. Pearson in the 19th century, during which the feet of the figures were cut off. Thornhill also designed the great west window, which shows the Biblical figures of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as well as representatives of the Twelve Tribes of Israel underneath.\nIn the Henry VII Chapel, the west window was designed by John Lawson and unveiled in 1995. It depicts coats of arms and cyphers of Westminster Abbey's benefactors, particularly John Templeton (whose coat of arms is prominent in the lower panel). In the centre are the arms of Elizabeth II. The central east window, designed by Alan Younger and dedicated to the Virgin Mary, was unveiled in 2000. It depicts Comet Hale\u2013Bopp, which was passing over the artist's house at the time, as the star of Bethlehem. The donors of the window, Lord and Lady Harris of Peckham, are shown kneeling at the bottom.\nIn 2018, artist David Hockney unveiled a new stained-glass window for the north transept to celebrate the reign of Elizabeth II. It shows a country scene inspired by his native Yorkshire, with hawthorn blossoms and blue skies. Hockney used an iPad to design the window, replicating the backlight that comes through stained glass.\nQueen's Diamond Jubilee Galleries.\nThe Westminster Abbey Museum was located in the 11th-century vaulted undercroft beneath the former monks' dormitory. This is one of the oldest areas of the abbey, dating almost to the foundation of the church by Edward the Confessor in 1065. This space had been used as a museum since 1908, but was closed to the public when it was replaced as a museum in June 2018 by the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Galleries (high in the abbey's triforium and accessed through the Weston Tower, which encloses a lift and stairs).\nThe exhibits include a set of life-size effigies of English and British monarchs and their consorts, originally made to lie on the coffin in the funeral procession or to be displayed over the tomb. The effigies date from the 14th to the 18th centuries, and some include original clothes.\nOn display in the galleries is \"\", a portrait by Ralph Heimans of the queen standing on the Cosmati pavement where she was crowned in 1953. Other exhibits include a model of an unbuilt tower designed by Christopher Wren; a paper model of the abbey as it was for Queen Victoria's 1837 coronation; and the wedding licence of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, who were married in the abbey in 2011.\nBurials and memorials.\nOver 3,300 people are buried or commemorated in the abbey. For much of its history, most of the people buried there (other than monarchs) were people with a connection to the church \u2013 either ordinary locals or the monks of the abbey, who were generally buried without surviving markers. Since the 18th century, it has been an honour for any British person to be buried or commemorated in the abbey\u00a0\u2013 a practice boosted by the lavish funeral and monument of Isaac Newton, who died in 1727. By 1900, so many prominent figures were buried in the abbey that the writer William Morris called it a \"National Valhalla\".\nPoliticians buried in the abbey include Pitt the Elder, Charles James Fox, Pitt the Younger, William Wilberforce, William Gladstone, and Clement Attlee. A cluster of scientists surrounds the tomb of Isaac Newton, including Charles Darwin and Stephen Hawking. Actors include David Garrick, Henry Irving, and Laurence Olivier. Musicians tend to be buried in the north aisle of the nave, and include Henry Purcell and Ralph Vaughan Williams. George Frideric Handel is buried in Poets' Corner.\nAn estimated 18 English, Scottish and British monarchs are buried in the abbey, including Edward the Confessor, Henry III, Edward I, Edward III, Richard II, Henry V, Edward V, Henry VII, Edward VI, Mary I, Mary Queen of Scots, Elizabeth I, James I, Charles II, Mary II, William III, Queen Anne, and George II. Elizabeth and Mary Queen of Scots were the last monarchs to be buried with full tomb effigies; monarchs buried after them are commemorated in the abbey with simple inscriptions. George II was the last monarch to be buried in the abbey, in 1760, and George III's brother, Henry Frederick, was the last member of the royal family to be buried in the abbey, in 1790. Most monarchs after George II have been buried in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, or at the Frogmore Royal Burial Ground, east of Windsor Castle.\nPoets' Corner.\nThe south transept of the church is known as Poets' Corner because of its high number of burials of, and memorials to, poets and writers. The first was Geoffrey Chaucer (buried around 1400), who was employed as Clerk of the King's Works and had apartments in the abbey. A second poet, Edmund Spenser (who was local to the abbey), was buried nearby in 1599. The idea of a Poets' Corner did not crystallise until the 18th century, when memorials were established to writers buried elsewhere, such as William Shakespeare and John Milton. Since then, writers buried in Poets' Corner have included John Dryden, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, Charles Dickens, and Rudyard Kipling. Not all writers buried in the abbey are in the south transept; Ben Jonson is buried standing upright in the north aisle of the nave, and Aphra Behn in the cloisters.\nThe Unknown Warrior.\nOn the floor, just inside the Great West Door in the centre of the nave, is the grave of the Unknown Warrior: an unidentified soldier killed on a European battlefield during the First World War. Although many countries have a Tomb of the Unknown Soldier (or Warrior), the one in Westminster Abbey was the first; it came about as a response to the unprecedented death toll of the war. The idea came from army chaplain David Railton, who suggested it in 1920. The funeral was held on 11 November 1920, the second anniversary of the end of the war. The Unknown Warrior lay in state for a week afterwards, and an estimated 1.25\u00a0million people viewed his gravesite in that time. This grave is the only floor stone in the abbey on which it is forbidden to walk, and every visit by a foreign head of state begins with a visit to it.\nRoyal occasions.\nThe abbey has strong connections with the royal family. It has been patronised by monarchs, been the location for coronations, royal weddings and funerals, and several monarchs have attended services there. One monarch was born and one died at Westminster Abbey. In 1413, Henry IV collapsed while praying at the shrine of Edward the Confessor. He was moved into the Jerusalem Chamber, and died shortly afterwards. Edward V was born in the abbot's house in 1470.\nThe first jubilee celebration held at the abbey was for Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee in 1887. Rather than wearing the full regalia that she had worn at her coronation, she wore her black mourning clothes topped with the insignia of the Order of the Garter and a miniature crown. She sat in the Coronation Chair\u2014which received a coat of dark varnish for the occasion, which was painstakingly removed afterwards\u2014making her the only monarch to sit in the chair twice. Queen Elizabeth II and her husband, Prince Philip, marked their silver, gold, and diamond wedding anniversaries with services at the abbey and regularly attended annual observances there for Commonwealth Day.\nThe monarch participates in the Office of the Royal Maundy on Maundy Thursday each year, during which selected elderly people (as many people of each sex as the monarch has years of their life) receive alms of coins. The service has been held at churches around the country since 1952, returning to the abbey every 10 years.\nCoronations.\nSince the coronation of William the Conqueror in 1066, 40 English and British monarchs have been crowned in Westminster Abbey (not counting Edward V, Lady Jane Grey, and Edward VIII, who were never crowned). In 1216, Henry III could not be crowned in the abbey because London was occupied by hostile forces at the time. Henry was crowned in Gloucester Cathedral, and had a second coronation at Westminster Abbey in 1220. When he had the abbey rebuilt, it was designed with long transepts to accommodate many guests at future coronations. Much of the order of service derives from the \"Liber Regalis\", an illuminated manuscript made in 1377 for the coronation of Richard II and held in the abbey's collections. On 6 May 2023, the coronation of Charles III took place at the abbey. The area used in the church is the crossing, known in the abbey as \"the theatre\" because of its suitability for grand events. The space in the crossing is clear rather than filled with immovable pews (like many similar churches), allowing for temporary seating in the transepts.\nThe Coronation Chair (the throne on which English and British sovereigns are seated when they are crowned) is in the abbey's St George's Chapel near the west door, and has been used at coronations since the 14th century. From 1301 to 1996 (except for a short time in 1950, when the stone was stolen by Scottish nationalists), the chair housed the Stone of Scone upon which the kings of Scots were crowned. Although it has been kept in Scotland at Edinburgh Castle since 1996, the stone is returned to the Coronation Chair in the abbey as needed for coronations. The chair was accessible to the public during the 18th and 19th centuries; people could sit in it, and some carved initials into the woodwork.\nBefore the 17th century, a king would hold a separate coronation for his new queen if he married after his coronation. The last of these to take place in the abbey was the coronation of Anne Boleyn in 1533, after her marriage to Henry VIII. Twenty-nine coronations of queens consort have been held in the abbey, the most recent being Queen Camilla. A coronation for Jane Seymour, Henry VIII's third wife, was planned but she died before it took place; no coronations were planned for Henry's subsequent wives. Mary I's husband, Philip of Spain, was not given a separate coronation due to concerns that he would attempt to rule alone after Mary's death. Since then, there have been few opportunities for a second coronation; monarchs have generally come to the throne already married.\nHenry II held a coronation ceremony at Westminster Abbey in 1170 for his son, known as Henry the Young King, while Henry II was still alive in an attempt to secure the succession. However, the Young King died before his father and never took the throne.\nWeddings.\nAt least 16 royal weddings have taken place at the abbey. Royal weddings at the abbey were relatively rare before the 20th century, with royals often married in a Chapel Royal or at Windsor Castle; this changed with the 1922 wedding of Princess Mary at the abbey. In 1923, Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon became the first royal bride to leave her bouquet on the grave of the Unknown Warrior, a practice continued by many royal brides since.\nRoyal weddings have included:\nFunerals.\nMany royal funerals took place at the abbey between that of Edward the Confessor in 1066 and that of Prince Henry, the last royal buried in the church, in 1790. There were no royal funerals at the abbey from then until that of Queen Alexandra in 1925; the queen was buried in Windsor Castle. Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother was another queen consort who had a funeral at the abbey before being buried elsewhere, in 2002.\nOn 6 September 1997, the ceremonial funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales was held at the abbey. Before the funeral, the railings of the abbey were swamped with flowers and tributes. The event was more widely seen than any previous occasion in the abbey's history, with 2\u00a0billion television viewers worldwide. Diana was buried privately on a private island at Althorp, her family estate.\nOn 19 September 2022, the state funeral of Elizabeth II took place at the abbey before her burial at St George's Chapel, Windsor. It was the first funeral of a monarch at Westminster Abbey for more than 260 years.\nPeople.\nDean and Chapter.\nWestminster Abbey is a collegiate church governed by the Dean and Chapter of Westminster as established by a royal charter from Elizabeth I dated 21 May 1560, which created it as the Collegiate Church of St Peter Westminster (a royal peculiar). In 2019, David Hoyle was appointed Dean of Westminster. The chapter consists of four canons and a senior administrative officer, known as the Receiver General. One of the canons is also rector of the adjoining St Margaret's Church, Westminster, and is often the chaplain of the Speaker of the House of Commons. In addition to the dean and canons, there are minor canons.\nKing's almsmen.\nSix King's (or Queen's) almsmen and women are supported by the abbey. They are appointed by royal warrant on the recommendation of the dean and the Home Secretary, attend Matins and Evensong on Sundays, and perform requested duties for a small stipend. On duty, they wear a distinctive red gown with a crowned rose badge on the left shoulder.\nThe almshouse was founded near the abbey by Henry VII in 1502, and the twelve almsmen and three almswomen were originally minor court officials who were retired due to age or disability. They were required to be over the age of 50, single, with a good reputation, literate, able to look after themselves, and with an income of under \u00a34 per year. The building survived the Dissolution of the Monasteries, but was demolished for road-widening in 1779. From the late 18th to the late 20th century, almsmen were usually old soldiers and sailors; today, they are primarily retired abbey employees.\nSchools.\nWestminster School is in the abbey. Instruction has taken place since the 14th century with the monks of the abbey; the school regards its founder as Elizabeth I, who dissolved the monastery for the last time and provided for the establishment of the school, the dean, canons, assistant clergy, and lay officers. The schoolboys were rambunctious; Westminster boys have defaced the Coronation Chair, disrupted services, and once interrupted the consecration of four bishops with a bare-knuckle fight in the cloisters. One schoolboy carved on the Coronation Chair that he had slept in it overnight, making him probably its longest inhabitant. Westminster School became independent of the abbey Dean and Chapter in 1868, although the institutions remain closely connected. Westminster Abbey Choir School, also on the abbey grounds, educates the choirboys who sing for abbey services.\nOrder of the Bath.\nThe Most Honourable Order of the Bath is a British order of chivalry whose spiritual home is the abbey's Henry VII Chapel. The order was founded by George I in 1725, fell out of fashion after 1812, and was revived by George V in 1913. The name derives from the elaborate medieval ceremony for appointing a knight, which included bathing as a symbol of purification. Members are given stalls with their banner, crest, and a stall plate at installation ceremonies in the abbey every four years. Since there are more members than stalls, some members wait many years for their installation. The Order of the Bath is the fourth-oldest British orders of chivalry, after the Orders of the Garter, the Thistle, and St Patrick (the latter is presently dormant).\nMusic.\nAndrew Nethsingha has been the abbey's Organist and Master of the Choristers since 2023. Matthew Jorysz is the Sub-Organist, Paul Greally is the Assistant Organist, and Fran\u00e7ois Cloete is the organ scholar.\nChoir.\nSince its foundation in the 14th century, the primary role of the Westminster Abbey choir has been to sing for daily services; the choir also plays a central role in many state occasions, including royal weddings and funerals, coronations, and memorial services. In 2012, the choir accepted an invitation from Pope Benedict XVI to sing with the Sistine Chapel Choir at a Papal Mass in St Peter's Basilica. The all-male choir consists of twelve professional adult singers and thirty boy choristers from eight to 13 years old who attend the Westminster Abbey Choir School.\nOrgan.\nThe first record of an organ at Westminster Abbey was the mention of a gift of three marks from Henry III in 1240 for the repair of one (or more) organs. \"Unum parem organorum\" (\"a pair of organs\") was recorded in the Lady Chapel in 1304. An inventory compiled for the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1540 lists a pair of organs in the choir and one in the Islip Chapel. During the Commonwealth, a Royalist source said that soldiers who were billeted in the abbey \"brake downe the Organ, and pawned the pipes at severall Ale-houses for pots of Ale\"; an organ was played at the Restoration in 1660, however, suggesting that it had not been completely destroyed. In 1720, an organ gifted by George II and built by Christopher Shrider was installed over the choir screen; organs had previously been hidden on the north side of the choir. The organ was rebuilt by William Hill &amp; Son in 1848.\nA new organ was built by Harrison &amp; Harrison in 1937, with four manuals and 84 speaking stops, and was played publicly for the first time at the coronation of George VI and Elizabeth that year. Some pipework from the previous Hill organ of 1848 was re-voiced and incorporated into the new instrument. The two organ cases, designed and built in the late 19th century by J. L. Pearson, were reinstated and coloured in 1959.\nIn 1982 and 1987, Harrison &amp; Harrison enlarged the organ at the direction of Simon Preston to include an additional lower choir organ and a bombarde organ. The full instrument has five manuals and 109 speaking stops. Its console was refurbished by Harrison &amp; Harrison in 2006, and space was prepared for two additional 16-foot stops on the lower choir organ and the bombarde organ. The abbey has three other organs: the two-manual Queen's Organ in the Lady Chapel, a smaller continuo organ, and a practice organ.\nBells.\nThere have been bells at the abbey since at least the time of Henry III, and the current bells were installed in the north-west tower in 1971. The ring is made up of ten bells, hung for change ringing, which were cast in 1971 by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry and tuned to the musical notes F#, E, D, C#, B, A, G, F#, E and D. The tenor bell in D (588.5\u00a0Hz) has a weight of 30\u00a0cwt, 1\u00a0qtr, 15\u00a0lb (3,403\u00a0lb, or 1,544\u00a0kg). Two additional service bells were cast by Robert Mot in 1585 and 1598, and a sanctus bell was cast in 1738 by Richard Phelps and Thomas Lester. Two bells are unused; one was cast c.\u20091320, and the second was cast in 1742 by Thomas Lester. The Westminster Abbey Company of Ringers ring peals on special occasions, such as the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton.\nIn popular culture.\nWestminster Abbey is mentioned in the play \"Henry VIII\" by William Shakespeare and John Fletcher, when a gentleman describes Anne Boleyn's coronation. The abbey was mentioned in a 1598 sonnet by Thomas Bastard which begins, \"When I behold, with deep astonishment/ To famous Westminster how there restort/ Living in brass or stony monument/ The princes and the worthies of all sort\". Poetry about the abbey has also been written by Francis Beaumont and John Betjeman. The building has appeared in paintings by artists such as Canaletto, Wenceslaus Hollar, William Bruce Ellis Ranken, and J. M. W. Turner.\nPlaywright Alan Bennett produced \"The Abbey\", a 1995 documentary recounting his experiences of the building. Key scenes in the book and film \"The Da Vinci Code\" take place in Westminster Abbey. The abbey refused to allow filming in 2005 (calling the book \"theologically unsound\"), and the film uses Lincoln Cathedral as a stand-in. The abbey issued a fact sheet to their staff which answered questions and debunked several claims made in the book. In 2022, it was announced that the abbey had given rare permission to film inside the church for \"\".\nNotes and references.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

According to the \"Annuario Pontificio\", the dates may have ranged from 162\u2013168 to 170\u2013177. He was born in Fundi, in the Lazio region of Italy. Soter is known for declaring that marriage was valid only as a sacrament blessed by a priest and also for formally inaugurating Easter as an annual festival in Rome. His name, from Greek \u03a3\u03c9\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 from \u03c3\u03c9\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1 \"saviour\", would be his baptismal name, as his lifetime predates the tradition of adopting papal names.\nEarly life.\nPope Soter was born in Fondi, Lazio (then in Campania), into a Greek family. This ancestry seems to have made Soter particularly interested in the problems of relations with the Greek Church, even sending a collection of funds to the Church of Corinth, in order for them to be distributed to the poor.\nRoman Martyrology.\nSaint Soter's feast day is celebrated on 22 April, as is that of Saint Caius. The Roman Martyrology, the official list of recognized saints, references Soter: \"At Rome, Saint Soter, Pope, whom Dionysius of Corinth praises for his outstanding charity towards needy exiled Christians who came to him, and towards those who had been condemned to the mines.\"\nIt has often been supposed that all the earliest Popes suffered martyrdom, but the Roman Martyrology does not give Pope Soter the title of martyr. The book detailing the 1969 revision of the General Roman Calendar states: \"There are no grounds for including Saint Soter and Saint Caius among the martyrs.\"\nReaction to the Montanist movement.\nThe Montanist movement, which originated in Asia Minor, made its way to Rome and Gaul in the second half of the 2nd century, during the reign of Eleuterus. Its nature did not diverge so much from the orthodoxy of the time for it to initially be labeled heresy. During the violent persecution at Lyon, in 177, local confessors wrote from their prison concerning the new movement to the Asiatic and Phrygian communities as well as to Pope Eleuterus. The bearer of their letter to the pope was the presbyter Irenaeus, soon to become Bishop of Lyon. It appears from statements of Eusebius concerning these letters that the Christians of Lyon, though opposed to the Montanist movement, advocated patience and pleaded for the preservation of ecclesiastical unity.\nWhen the Roman church took its definite stand against Montanism is not precisely known. Tertullian records that a Roman bishop sent some conciliatory letters to the Montanists, but based on the complaints of Praxeas \"concerning the prophets themselves and their churches, and by insistence on the decisions of the bishop's predecessors\" forced the pontiff to recall these letters. The \"Praedestinatorum Haeresis\" (once attributed to Augustine of Hippo, but now considered to be the work of an unknown author) states that \"Holy Soter, Pope of the City, wrote against them a book, as did the master, Apollonius of Ephesus. Against these wrote the priest Tertullian of Carthage, who \"in all ways wrote well, wrote first and wrote incomparably, in this alone did reprehensibly, that he defended Montanus\". At Rome, the Gnostics and Marcionites continued to preach against the Catholic Church.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Morality can be a body of standards or principles derived from a code of conduct from a particular philosophy, religion or culture, or it can derive from a standard that is understood to be universal. Morality may also be specifically synonymous with \"goodness\", \"appropriateness\" or \"rightness\".\nMoral philosophy includes meta-ethics, which studies abstract issues such as moral ontology and moral epistemology, and normative ethics, which studies more concrete systems of moral decision-making such as deontological ethics and consequentialism. An example of normative ethical philosophy is the Golden Rule, which states: \"One should treat others as one would like others to treat oneself.\"\nImmorality is the active opposition to morality (i.e., opposition to that which is good or right), while amorality is variously defined as an unawareness of, indifference toward, or disbelief in any particular set of moral standards or principles.\nEthics.\nEthics (also known as moral philosophy) is the branch of philosophy which addresses questions of morality. The word 'ethics' is \"commonly used interchangeably with 'morality'... and sometimes it is used more narrowly to mean the moral principles of a particular tradition, group, or individual\". Likewise, certain types of ethical theories, especially deontological ethics, sometimes distinguish between ethics and morality.\nSimon Blackburn writes:\nAlthough the morality of people and their ethics amounts to the same thing, there is a usage that restricts morality to systems such as that of Immanuel Kant, based on notions such as duty, obligation, and principles of conduct, reserving ethics for the more Aristotelian approach to practical reasoning, based on the notion of a virtue, and generally avoiding the separation of 'moral' considerations from other practical considerations.\nDescriptive and normative.\nIn its descriptive sense, \"morality\" refers to personal or cultural values, codes of conduct or social mores that are observed to be accepted by a significant number of individuals (not necessarily all) in a society. It does not connote objective claims of right or wrong, but only refers to claims of right and wrong that are seen to be made and to conflicts between different claims made. Descriptive ethics is the branch of philosophy which studies morality in this sense.\nIn its normative sense, \"morality\" refers to whatever (if anything) is \"actually\" right or wrong, which may be independent of the values or mores held by any particular peoples or cultures. Normative ethics is the branch of philosophy which studies morality in this sense.\nRealism and anti-realism.\nPhilosophical theories on the nature and origins of morality (that is, theories of meta-ethics) are broadly divided into two classes:\nSome forms of non-cognitivism and ethical subjectivism, while considered anti-realist in the robust sense used here, are considered realist in the sense synonymous with moral universalism. For example, universal prescriptivism is a universalist form of non-cognitivism which claims that morality is derived from reasoning about implied imperatives, and divine command theory and ideal observer theory are universalist forms of ethical subjectivism which claim that morality is derived from the edicts of a god or the hypothetical decrees of a perfectly rational being, respectively.\nAnthropology.\nMorality with practical reasoning.\nPractical reason is necessary for the moral agency but it is not a sufficient condition for moral agency. Real life issues that need solutions do need both rationality and emotion to be sufficiently moral. One uses rationality as a pathway to the ultimate decision, but the environment and emotions towards the environment at the moment must be a factor for the result to be truly moral, as morality is subject to culture. Something can only be morally acceptable if the culture as a whole has accepted this to be true. Both practical reason and relevant emotional factors are acknowledged as significant in determining the morality of a decision.\nTribal and territorial.\nCelia Green made a distinction between tribal and territorial morality. She characterizes the latter as predominantly negative and proscriptive: it defines a person's territory, including his or her property and dependents, which is not to be damaged or interfered with. Apart from these proscriptions, territorial morality is permissive, allowing the individual whatever behaviour does not interfere with the territory of another. By contrast, tribal morality is prescriptive, imposing the norms of the collective on the individual. These norms will be arbitrary, culturally dependent and 'flexible', whereas territorial morality aims at rules which are universal and absolute, such as Kant's 'categorical imperative' and Geisler's graded absolutism. Green relates the development of territorial morality to the rise of the concept of private property, and the ascendancy of contract over status.\nIn-group and out-group.\nSome observers hold that individuals apply distinct sets of moral rules to people depending on their membership of an \"in-group\" (the individual and those they believe to be of the same group) or an \"out-group\" (people not entitled to be treated according to the same rules). Some biologists, anthropologists and evolutionary psychologists believe this in-group/out-group discrimination has evolved because it enhances group survival. This belief has been confirmed by simple computational models of evolution. In simulations this discrimination can result in both unexpected cooperation towards the in-group and irrational hostility towards the out-group. Gary R. Johnson and V.S. Falger have argued that nationalism and patriotism are forms of this in-group/out-group boundary. Jonathan Haidt has noted that experimental observation indicating an in-group criterion provides one moral foundation substantially used by conservatives, but far less so by liberals.\nIn-group preference is also helpful at the individual level for the passing on of one's genes. For example, a mother who favors her own children more highly than the children of other people will give greater resources to her children than she will to strangers', thus heightening her children's chances of survival and her own gene's chances of being perpetuated. Due to this, within a population, there is substantial selection pressure exerted toward this kind of self-interest, such that eventually, all parents wind up favoring their own children (the in-group) over other children (the out-group).\nComparing cultures.\nPeterson and Seligman approach the anthropological view looking across cultures, geo-cultural areas and across millennia. They conclude that certain virtues have prevailed in all cultures they examined. The major virtues they identified include \"wisdom / knowledge; courage; humanity; justice; temperance; and transcendence\". Each of these include several divisions. For instance \"humanity\" includes \"love\", \"kindness\", and \"social intelligence\".\nStill, others theorize that morality is not always absolute, contending that moral issues often differ along cultural lines. A 2014 PEW research study among several nations illuminates significant cultural differences among issues commonly related to morality, including divorce, extramarital affairs, homosexuality, gambling, abortion, alcohol use, contraceptive use, and premarital sex. Each of the 40 countries in this study has a range of percentages according to what percentage of each country believes the common moral issues are acceptable, unacceptable, or not moral issues at all. Each percentage regarding the significance of the moral issue varies greatly on the culture in which the moral issue is presented.\nAdvocates of a theory known as moral relativism subscribe to the notion that moral virtues are right or wrong only within the context of a certain standpoint (e.g., cultural community). In other words, what is morally acceptable in one culture may be taboo in another. They further contend that no moral virtue can objectively be proven right or wrong Critics of moral relativism point to historical atrocities such as infanticide, slavery, or genocide as counter arguments, noting the difficulty in accepting these actions simply through cultural lenses.\nFons Trompenaars, author of \"Did the Pedestrian Die?\", tested members of different cultures with various moral dilemmas. One of these was whether the driver of a car would have his friend, a passenger riding in the car, lie in order to protect the driver from the consequences of driving too fast and hitting a pedestrian. Trompenaars found that different cultures had quite different expectations, from none to definite.\nAnthropologists from Oxford's Institute of Cognitive &amp; Evolutionary Anthropology (part of the School of Anthropology &amp; Museum Ethnography) analysed ethnographic accounts of ethics from 60 societies, comprising over 600,000 words from over 600 sources and discovered what they believe to be seven universal moral rules: help your family, help your group, return favours, be brave, defer to superiors, divide resources fairly, and respect others' property.\nEvolution.\nThe development of modern morality is a process closely tied to sociocultural evolution. Some evolutionary biologists, particularly sociobiologists, believe that morality is a product of evolutionary forces acting at an individual level and also at the group level through group selection (although to what degree this actually occurs is a controversial topic in evolutionary theory). Some sociobiologists contend that the set of behaviors that constitute morality evolved largely because they provided possible survival or reproductive benefits (i.e. increased evolutionary success). Humans consequently evolved \"pro-social\" emotions, such as feelings of empathy or guilt, in response to these moral behaviors.\nOn this understanding, moralities are sets of self-perpetuating and biologically driven behaviors which encourage human cooperation. Biologists contend that all social animals, from ants to elephants, have modified their behaviors, by restraining immediate selfishness in order to improve their evolutionary fitness. Human morality, although sophisticated and complex relative to the moralities of other animals, is essentially a natural phenomenon that evolved to restrict excessive individualism that could undermine a group's cohesion and thereby reducing the individuals' fitness.\nOn this view, moral codes are ultimately founded on emotional instincts and intuitions that were selected for in the past because they aided survival and reproduction (inclusive fitness). Examples: the maternal bond is selected for because it improves the survival of offspring; the Westermarck effect, where close proximity during early years reduces mutual sexual attraction, underpins taboos against incest because it decreases the likelihood of genetically risky behaviour such as inbreeding.\nThe phenomenon of reciprocity in nature is seen by evolutionary biologists as one way to begin to understand human morality. Its function is typically to ensure a reliable supply of essential resources, especially for animals living in a habitat where food quantity or quality fluctuates unpredictably. For example, some vampire bats fail to feed on prey some nights while others manage to consume a surplus. Bats that did eat will then regurgitate part of their blood meal to save a conspecific from starvation. Since these animals live in close-knit groups over many years, an individual can count on other group members to return the favor on nights when it goes hungry (Wilkinson, 1984)\nMarc Bekoff and Jessica Pierce (2009) have argued that morality is a suite of behavioral capacities likely shared by all mammals living in complex social groups (e.g., wolves, coyotes, elephants, dolphins, rats, chimpanzees). They define morality as \"a suite of interrelated other-regarding behaviors that cultivate and regulate complex interactions within social groups.\" This suite of behaviors includes empathy, reciprocity, altruism, cooperation, and a sense of fairness. In related work, it has been convincingly demonstrated that chimpanzees show empathy for each other in a wide variety of contexts. They also possess the ability to engage in deception, and a level of social politics prototypical of our own tendencies for gossip and reputation management.\nChristopher Boehm (1982) has hypothesized that the incremental development of moral complexity throughout hominid evolution was due to the increasing need to avoid disputes and injuries in moving to open savanna and developing stone weapons. Other theories are that increasing complexity was simply a correlate of increasing group size and brain size, and in particular the development of theory of mind abilities.\nPsychology.\nIn modern moral psychology, morality is sometimes considered to change through personal development. Several psychologists have produced theories on the development of morals, usually going through stages of different morals. Lawrence Kohlberg, Jean Piaget, and Elliot Turiel have cognitive-developmental approaches to moral development; to these theorists morality forms in a series of constructive stages or domains. In the Ethics of care approach established by Carol Gilligan, moral development occurs in the context of caring, mutually responsive relationships which are based on interdependence, particularly in parenting but also in social relationships generally. Social psychologists such as Martin Hoffman and Jonathan Haidt emphasize social and emotional development based on biology, such as empathy. Moral identity theorists, such as William Damon and Mordechai Nisan, see moral commitment as arising from the development of a self-identity that is defined by moral purposes: this moral self-identity leads to a sense of responsibility to pursue such purposes. Of historical interest in psychology are the theories of psychoanalysts such as Sigmund Freud, who believe that moral development is the product of aspects of the super-ego as guilt-shame avoidance. Theories of moral development therefore tend to regard it as positive moral development: the higher stages are morally higher, though this, naturally, involves a circular argument. The higher stages are better because they are higher, but the better higher because they are better.\nAs an alternative to viewing morality as an individual trait, some sociologists as well as social- and discursive psychologists have taken upon themselves to study the \"in-vivo\" aspects of morality by examining how persons conduct themselves in social interaction.\nA new study analyses the common perception of a decline in morality in societies worldwide and throughout history. Adam M. Mastroianni and Daniel T. Gilbert present a series of studies indicating that the perception of moral decline is an illusion and easily produced, with implications for misallocation of resources, underuse of social support, and social influence. To begin with, the authors demonstrate that people in no less than 60 nations hold the belief that morality is deteriorating continuously, and this conviction has been present for the last 70 years. Subsequently, they indicate that people ascribe this decay to the declining morality of individuals as they age and the succeeding generations. Thirdly, the authors demonstrate that people's evaluations of the morality of their peers have not decreased over time, indicating that the belief in moral decline is an illusion. Lastly, the authors explain a basic psychological mechanism that uses two well-established phenomena (distorted exposure to information and distorted memory of information) to cause the illusion of moral decline. The authors present studies that validate some of the predictions about the circumstances in which the perception of moral decline is attenuated, eliminated, or reversed (e.g., when participants are asked about the morality of people closest to them or people who lived before they were born).\nMoral cognition.\nMoral cognition refers to cognitive processes implicated in moral judgment and decision making, and moral action. It consists of several domain-general cognitive processes, ranging from perception of a morally salient stimulus to reasoning when faced with a moral dilemma. While it is important to mention that there is not a single cognitive faculty dedicated exclusively to moral cognition, characterizing the contributions of domain-general processes to moral behavior is a critical scientific endeavor to understand how morality works and how it can be improved.\nCognitive psychologists and neuroscientists investigate the inputs to these cognitive processes and their interactions, as well as how these contribute to moral behavior by running controlled experiments. In these experiments putatively moral versus nonmoral stimuli are compared to each other, while controlling for other variables such as content or working memory load. Often, the differential neural response to specifically moral statements or scenes, are examined using functional neuroimaging experiments.\nCritically, the specific cognitive processes that are involved depend on the prototypical situation that a person encounters. For instance, while situations that require an active decision on a moral dilemma may require active reasoning, an immediate reaction to a shocking moral violation may involve quick, affect-laden processes. Nonetheless, certain cognitive skills such as being able to attribute mental states\u2014beliefs, intents, desires, emotions to oneself, and others is a common feature of a broad range of prototypical situations. In line with this, a meta-analysis found overlapping activity between moral emotion and moral reasoning tasks, suggesting a shared neural network for both tasks. The results of this meta-analysis, however, also demonstrated that the processing of moral input is affected by task demands.\nRegarding the issues of morality in video games, some scholars believe that because players appear in video games as actors, they maintain a distance between their sense of self and the role of the game in terms of imagination. Therefore, the decision-making and moral behavior of players in the game are not representing player's Moral dogma.\nIt has been recently found that moral judgment consists in concurrent evaluations of three different components that align with precepts from three dominant moral theories (virtue ethics, deontology, and consequentialism): the character of a person (Agent-component, A); their actions (Deed-component, D); and the consequences brought about in the situation (Consequences-component, C). This, implies that various inputs of the situation a person encounters affect moral cognition.\nJonathan Haidt distinguishes between two types of moral cognition: moral intuition and moral reasoning. Moral intuition involves the fast, automatic, and affective processes that result in an evaluative feeling of good-bad or like-dislike, \"without\" awareness of going through any steps. Conversely, moral reasoning does involve conscious mental activity to reach a moral judgment. Moral reasoning is controlled and less affective than moral intuition. When making moral judgments, humans perform moral reasoning to support their initial intuitive feeling. However, there are three ways humans can override their immediate intuitive response. The first way is conscious verbal reasoning (for example, examining costs and benefits). The second way is reframing a situation to see a new perspective or consequence, which triggers a different intuition. Finally, one can talk to other people which illuminates new arguments. In fact, interacting with other people is the cause of most moral change.\nNeuroscience.\nThe brain areas that are consistently involved when humans reason about moral issues have been investigated by multiple quantitative large-scale meta-analyses of the brain activity changes reported in the moral neuroscience literature. The neural network underlying moral decisions overlaps with the network pertaining to representing others' intentions (i.e., theory of mind) and the network pertaining to representing others' (vicariously experienced) emotional states (i.e., empathy). This supports the notion that moral reasoning is related to both seeing things from other persons' points of view and to grasping others' feelings. These results provide evidence that the neural network underlying moral decisions is probably domain-global (i.e., there might be no such things as a \"moral module\" in the human brain) and might be dissociable into cognitive and affective sub-systems.\nCognitive neuroscientist Jean Decety thinks that the ability to recognize and vicariously experience what another individual is undergoing was a key step forward in the evolution of social behavior, and ultimately, morality. The inability to feel empathy is one of the defining characteristics of psychopathy, and this would appear to lend support to Decety's view. Recently, drawing on empirical research in evolutionary theory, developmental psychology, social neuroscience, and psychopathy, Jean Decety argued that empathy and morality are neither systematically opposed to one another, nor inevitably complementary.\nBrain areas.\nAn essential, shared component of moral judgment involves the capacity to detect morally salient content within a given social context. Recent research implicated the salience network in this initial detection of moral content. The salience network responds to behaviorally salient events and may be critical to modulate downstream default and frontal control network interactions in the service of complex moral reasoning and decision-making processes.\nThe explicit making of moral right and wrong judgments coincides with activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPC), a region involved in valuation, while intuitive reactions to situations containing implicit moral issues activates the temporoparietal junction area, a region that plays a key role in understanding intentions and beliefs.\nStimulation of the VMPC by transcranial magnetic stimulation, or neurological lesion, has been shown to inhibit the ability of human subjects to take into account intent when forming a moral judgment. According to such investigations, TMS did not disrupt participants' ability to make any moral judgment. On the contrary, moral judgments of intentional harms and non-harms were unaffected by TMS to either the RTPJ or the control site; presumably, however, people typically make moral judgments of intentional harms by considering not only the action's harmful outcome but the agent's intentions and beliefs. So why were moral judgments of intentional harms not affected by TMS to the RTPJ? One possibility is that moral judgments typically reflect a weighted function of any morally relevant information that is available at the time. Based on this view, when information concerning the agent's belief is unavailable or degraded, the resulting moral judgment simply reflects a higher weighting of other morally relevant factors (e.g., outcome). Alternatively, following TMS to the RTPJ, moral judgments might be made via an abnormal processing route that does not take belief into account. On either account, when belief information is degraded or unavailable, moral judgments are shifted toward other morally relevant factors (e.g., outcome). For intentional harms and non-harms, however, the outcome suggests the same moral judgment as to the intention. Thus, the researchers suggest that TMS to the RTPJ disrupted the processing of negative beliefs for both intentional harms and attempted harms, but the current design allowed the investigators to detect this effect only in the case of attempted harms, in which the neutral outcomes did not afford harsh moral judgments on their own.\nSimilarly, individuals with a lesion of the VMPC judge an action purely on its outcome and are unable to take into account the intent of that action.\nGenetics.\nMoral intuitions may have genetic bases. A 2022 study conducted by scholars Michael Zakharin and Timothy C. Bates, and published by the \"European Journal of Personality\", found that moral foundations have significant genetic bases. Another study, conducted by Smith and Hatemi, similarly found significant evidence in support of moral heritability by looking at and comparing the answers of moral dilemmas between twins. \nGenetics play a role in influencing prosocial behaviors and moral decision-making. Genetics contribute to the development and expression of certain traits and behaviors, including those related to morality. However, it is important to note that while genetics play a role in shaping certain aspects of moral behavior, morality itself is a multifaceted concept that encompasses cultural, societal, and personal influences as well.\nPolitics.\nIf morality is the answer to the question 'how ought we to live' at the individual level, politics can be seen as addressing the same question at the social level, though the political sphere raises additional problems and challenges. It is therefore unsurprising that evidence has been found of a relationship between attitudes in morality and politics. Moral foundations theory, authored by Jonathan Haidt and colleagues, has been used to study the differences between liberals and conservatives, in this regard. Haidt found that Americans who identified as liberals tended to value care and fairness higher than loyalty, respect and purity. Self-identified conservative Americans valued care and fairness less and the remaining three values more. Both groups gave care the highest over-all weighting, but conservatives valued fairness the lowest, whereas liberals valued purity the lowest. Haidt also hypothesizes that the origin of this division in the United States can be traced to geo-historical factors, with conservatism strongest in closely knit, ethnically homogeneous communities, in contrast to port-cities, where the cultural mix is greater, thus requiring more liberalism.\nGroup morality develops from shared concepts and beliefs and is often codified to regulate behavior within a culture or community. Various defined actions come to be called moral or immoral. Individuals who choose moral action are popularly held to possess \"moral fiber\", whereas those who indulge in immoral behavior may be labeled as socially degenerate. The continued existence of a group may depend on widespread conformity to codes of morality; an inability to adjust moral codes in response to new challenges is sometimes credited with the demise of a community (a positive example would be the function of Cistercian reform in reviving monasticism; a negative example would be the role of the Dowager Empress in the subjugation of China to European interests). Within nationalist movements, there has been some tendency to feel that a nation will not survive or prosper without acknowledging one common morality, regardless of its content.\nPolitical morality is also relevant to the behavior internationally of national governments, and to the support they receive from their host population. The Sentience Institute, co-founded by Jacy Reese Anthis, analyzes the trajectory of moral progress in society via the framework of an expanding moral circle. Noam Chomsky states that\n... if we adopt the principle of universality: if an action is right (or wrong) for others, it is right (or wrong) for us. Those who do not rise to the minimal moral level of applying to themselves the standards they apply to others\u2014more stringent ones, in fact\u2014plainly cannot be taken seriously when they speak of appropriateness of response; or of right and wrong, good and evil.\nIn fact, one of them, maybe the most, elementary of moral principles is that of universality, that is, If something's right for me, it's right for you; if it's wrong for you, it's wrong for me. Any moral code that is even worth looking at has that at its core somehow.\nReligion.\nReligion and morality are not synonymous. Morality does not depend upon religion although for some this is \"an almost automatic assumption\". According to \"The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics\", religion and morality \"are to be defined differently and have no definitional connections with each other. Conceptually and in principle, morality and a religious value system are two distinct kinds of value systems or action guides.\"\nPositions.\nWithin the wide range of moral traditions, religious value-systems co-exist with contemporary secular frameworks such as consequentialism, freethought, humanism, utilitarianism, and others. There are many types of religious value-systems. Modern monotheistic religions, such as Islam, Judaism, Christianity, and to a certain degree others such as Sikhism and Zoroastrianism, define right and wrong by the laws and rules as set forth by their respective scriptures and as interpreted by religious leaders within each respective faith. Other religions spanning pantheistic to nontheistic tend to be less absolute. For example, within Buddhism, the intention of the individual and the circumstances should be accounted for in the form of merit, to determine if an action is termed right or wrong. Barbara Stoler Miller points out a further disparity between the values of religious traditions, stating that in Hinduism, \"practically, right and wrong are decided according to the categories of social rank, kinship, and stages of life. For modern Westerners, who have been raised on ideals of universality and egalitarianism, this relativity of values and obligations is the aspect of Hinduism most difficult to understand\".\nReligions provide different ways of dealing with moral dilemmas. For example, Hinduism lacks any absolute prohibition on killing, recognizing that it \"may be inevitable and indeed necessary\" in certain circumstances. Monotheistic traditions view certain acts\u2014such as abortion or divorce\u2014in more absolute terms.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[a] Religion is not always positively associated with morality. Philosopher David Hume stated that \"the greatest crimes have been found, in many instances, to be compatible with a superstitious piety and devotion; Hence it is justly regarded as unsafe to draw any inference in favor of a man's morals, from the fervor or strictness of his religious exercises, even though he himself believe them sincere.\"\nReligious value-systems can be used to justify acts that are contrary to general contemporary morality, such as massacres, misogyny and slavery. For example, Simon Blackburn states that \"apologists for Hinduism defend or explain away its involvement with the caste system, and apologists for Islam defend or explain away its harsh penal code or its attitude to women and infidels\". In regard to Christianity, he states that the \"Bible can be read as giving us a carte blanche for harsh attitudes to children, the mentally handicapped, animals, the environment, the divorced, unbelievers, people with various sexual habits, and elderly women\", and notes morally-suspect themes in the Bible's New Testament as well.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[e] Elizabeth Anderson likewise holds that \"the Bible contains both good and evil teachings\", and it is \"morally inconsistent\". Christian apologists address Blackburn's viewpoints and construe that Jewish laws in the Hebrew Bible showed the evolution of moral standards towards protecting the vulnerable, imposing a death penalty on those pursuing slavery and treating slaves as persons and not as property. Humanists like Paul Kurtz believe that we can identify moral values across cultures, even if we do not appeal to a supernatural or universalist understanding of principles \u2013 values including integrity, trustworthiness, benevolence, and fairness. These values can be resources for finding common ground between believers and nonbelievers.\nEmpirical analyses.\nSeveral studies have been conducted on the empirics of morality in various countries, and the overall relationship between faith and crime is unclear.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[b] A 2001 review of studies on this topic found \"The existing evidence surrounding the effect of religion on crime is varied, contested, and inconclusive, and currently, no persuasive answer exists as to the empirical relationship between religion and crime.\" Phil Zuckerman's 2008 book, \"Society without God\", based on studies conducted during 14 months in Scandinavia in 2005\u20132006, notes that Denmark and Sweden, \"which are probably the least religious countries in the world, and possibly in the history of the world\", enjoy \"among the lowest violent crime rates in the world [and] the lowest levels of corruption in the world\".&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[c]\nDozens of studies have been conducted on this topic since the twentieth century. A 2005 study by Gregory S. Paul published in the \"Journal of Religion and Society\" stated that, \"In general, higher rates of belief in and worship of a creator correlate with higher rates of homicide, juvenile and early adult mortality, STD infection rates, teen pregnancy, and abortion in the prosperous democracies,\" and \"In all secular developing democracies a centuries long-term trend has seen homicide rates drop to historical lows\" with the exceptions being the United States (with a high religiosity level) and \"theistic\" Portugal.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[d] In a response, Gary Jensen builds on and refines Paul's study. he concludes that a \"complex relationship\" exists between religiosity and homicide \"with some dimensions of religiosity encouraging homicide and other dimensions discouraging it\". In April 2012, the results of a study which tested their subjects' pro-social sentiments were published in the \"Social Psychological and Personality Science\" journal in which non-religious people had higher scores showing that they were more motivated by their own compassion to perform pro-social behaviors. Religious people were found to be less motivated by compassion to be charitable than by an inner sense of moral obligation.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\na.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ Studies on divorce in the United States done by the Barna Group suggested that atheists and agnostics have lower divorce rates than faith groups on average (though some faith groups had lower rates still). The study notes that fewer atheists and agnostics enter into marriage relative to faith-based individuals.\nb.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ Some studies appear to show positive links in the relationship between religiosity and moral behavior Modern research in criminology also suggests an inverse relationship between religion and crime, with some studies establishing this connection. A meta-analysis of 60 studies on religion and crime concluded, \"religious behaviors and beliefs exert a moderate deterrent effect on individuals' criminal behavior\".\nc.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ Zuckerman identifies that Scandinavians have \"relatively high rates of petty crime and burglary\", but \"their overall rates of violent crime\u2014such as murder, aggravated assault, and rape\u2014are among the lowest on earth\" (Zuckerman 2008, pp. 5\u20136).\nd.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ The authors also state that \"A few hundred years ago rates of homicide were astronomical in Christian Europe and the American colonies,\" and \"the least theistic secular developing democracies such as Japan, France, and Scandinavia have been most successful in these regards.\" They argue for a positive correlation between the degree of public religiosity in a society and certain measures of dysfunction, an analysis published later in the same journal argues that a number of methodological problems undermine any findings or conclusions in the research.\ne.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ Blackburn provides examples such as the phrase in Exodus 22:18 that has \"helped to burn alive tens or hundreds of thousands of women in Europe and America\": \"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live,\" and notes that the Old Testament God apparently has \"no problems with a slave-owning society\", considers birth control a crime punishable by death, and \"is keen on child abuse\". Others interpret these passages differently, arguing for example that Jewish laws show the evolution of moral standards in society: that Jews actually threatened those who pursued forced slavery with the death penalty, held that slaves were persons instead of property, and protected them in several ways.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was operated by the Central Overland California and Pikes Peak Express Company.\nDuring its 18 months of operation beginning in 1860, the Pony Express reduced the time for messages to travel between the east and west US coast to about 10 days. It became the west's most direct means of east\u2013west communication before the first transcontinental telegraph was established (October 24, 1861), and was vital for tying the new state of California with the rest of the United States.\nDespite a heavy subsidy, the Pony Express was not a financial success and went bankrupt in 18 months, when a faster telegraph service was established. Nevertheless, it demonstrated that a unified transcontinental system of communications could be established and operated year-round. When it was replaced by the telegraph, the Pony Express quickly became romanticized and became part of the lore of the Old West. Its reliance on the ability and endurance of hardy riders and fast horses was seen as evidence of rugged American individualism of the frontier times.\nInception and founding.\nThe idea of having a fast mail route to the Pacific Coast was prompted largely by California's newfound prominence and its rapidly growing population. After gold was discovered there in 1848, thousands of prospectors, investors, and businessmen made their way to California, at that time a new territory of the U.S. By 1850, California had entered the Union as a free state. By 1860, the population had grown to 380,000. The prospect of California and its national role became the source of bitter partisan debate in Congress. The demand for a faster way to get the mail and other communications to and from this westernmost state became even greater as the American Civil War approached.\nWilliam Russell, Alexander Majors, and William Bradford Waddell were the three founders of the Pony Express. They were already in the freighting and drayage business. At the peak of the operations, they employed 6,000 men, owned 75,000 oxen, thousands of wagons, and warehouses, plus a sawmill, a meatpacking plant, a bank, and an insurance company.\nRussell was a prominent businessman, well respected among his peers and the community. Waddell was co-owner of the firm Morehead, Waddell &amp; Co. In 1859, C. R. Morehead took the proposal for the Pony Express to President Buchanan. After Morehead was bought out and moved to Leavenworth to enter the mercantile business, Waddell merged his company with Russell's, changing the name to Waddell &amp; Russell. In 1855, they took on a new partner, Alexander Majors, and founded the company of Russell, Majors &amp; Waddell. They held government contracts for delivering army supplies to the western frontier, and Russell had a similar idea for contracts with the U.S. government for fast mail delivery.\nBy using a short route and mounted riders rather than traditional stagecoaches, they proposed to establish a fast mail service between St. Joseph, Missouri, and Sacramento, California, with letters delivered in 10 days, which many said was impossible. The initial price was set at $5 per , then $2.50, and by July 1861 to $1. The initial price was 250 times the price of mail through the normal mail service, which was $0.02. The founders of the Pony Express hoped to win an exclusive government mail contract, but that did not come about.\nRussell, Majors, and Waddell organized and put together the Pony Express in two months in the winter of 1860. The undertaking assembled 80 riders, 184 stations, 400 horses, and several hundred personnel during January and February 1861.\nMajors was a religious man and resolved \"by the help of God\" to overcome all difficulties. He presented each rider with a Pony Express special-edition Bible and required this oath, which they were also required to sign.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I, ... , do hereby swear, before the Great and Living God, that during my engagement, and while I am an employee of Russell, Majors, and Waddell, I will, under no circumstances, use profane language, that I will drink no intoxicating liquors, that I will not quarrel or fight with any other employee of the firm, and that in every respect I will conduct myself honestly, be faithful to my duties, and so direct all my acts as to win the confidence of my employers, so help me God.\u2014\u200a\nOperation.\nIn 1860, the roughly 186 Pony Express stations were about apart along the Pony Express route. At each station, the express rider would change to a fresh horse, get a bite to eat, and would only take the mail pouch called a \"mochila\" (from the Spanish for pouch or backpack) with him.\nThe employers stressed the importance of the pouch. They often said that, if it came to be, the horse and rider should perish before the \"mochila\" did. The \"mochila\" was thrown over the saddle and held in place by the weight of the rider sitting on it. Each corner had a \"cantina,\" or pocket. Bundles of mail were placed in these \"cantinas\", which were padlocked for safety. The\" mochila\" could hold of mail along with the of material carried on the horse. Eventually, everything except one revolver and a water sack was removed, allowing for a total of on the horse's back. Riders, who could not weigh over , changed about every , and rode day and night. In emergencies, a given rider might ride two stages back to back, over 20 hours on a quickly moving horse.\nWhether riders tried crossing the Sierra Nevada in winter is unknown, but they certainly crossed central Nevada. By 1860, a telegraph station was in Carson City, Nevada Territory. The riders received $125 a month as pay. As a comparison, the wage for unskilled labor at the time was about $0.43\u20131.00 per day, and for semi-skilled laborers like bricklayers and carpenters was usually less than $2 per day.\nAlexander Majors, one of the founders of the Pony Express, had acquired more than 400 horses for the project. He selected horses from around the west, paying an average of $200. These averaged about \u00a0hands high and each; thus, the name pony was appropriate, even if not strictly correct in all cases.\nPony Express route.\nBeginning at St. Joseph, Missouri, the approximately route roughly followed the Oregon and California trails to Fort Bridger in Wyoming, and then the Mormon Trail (known as the Hastings Cutoff) to Salt Lake City, Utah. From there, it followed the Central Nevada Route to Carson City, Nevada Territory, before passing over the Sierra and reaching to Sacramento, California. From there mail was transferred to boats to go downriver to San Francisco or, on occasion, via a combination of riders and ferries to the destination.\nThe route started at St. Joseph, Missouri, on the Missouri River, and then followed what is modern-day U.S. Highway 36 (the Pony Express Highway) to Marysville, Kansas, where it turned northwest following Little Blue River to Fort Kearny in Nebraska. Through Nebraska, it followed the Great Platte River Road, cutting through Gothenburg, Nebraska, clipping the edge of Colorado at Julesburg; and passing Courthouse Rock, Chimney Rock, and Scotts Bluff, before arriving first at Fort Laramie and then Fort Caspar (Platte Bridge Station) in Wyoming. From there, it followed the Sweetwater River, passing Independence Rock, Devil's Gate, and Split Rock, through South Pass to Fort Bridger and then south to Salt Lake City, Utah. From Salt Lake City, it generally followed the Central Nevada Route blazed in 1859 by Captain James H. Simpson of the Corps of Topographical Engineers. This route roughly follows today's US\u00a050 across Nevada and Utah. It crossed the Great Basin, the Utah-Nevada Desert, and the Sierra Nevada near Lake Tahoe before arriving in Sacramento. Mail was transferred and sent by steamer down the Sacramento River to San Francisco. An alternative overland route was used for the first month and whenever the steamer departure was missed. The alternative route, roughly following first today's Interstate 80, then Interstate 680, then California Route 24, took the mail by horseback through Benicia, California. This route would then cross the Carquinez Strait via ferry to Martinez, then on horseback onward to Oakland and across the San Francisco Bay by ferry to San Francisco.\nStations.\nAlong the long and arduous route used by the Pony Express, 190 stations were used. The stations and station keepers were essential to the successful, timely, and smooth operation of the Pony Express mail system. The stations were often fashioned out of existing structures, several of them located in military forts, while others were built anew in remote areas where living conditions were basic. The route was divided into five divisions. To maintain the rigid schedule, 157 relay stations were located from apart, as the terrain would allow. At each \"swing station\", riders would exchange their tired mounts for fresh ones, while \"home stations\" provided room and board for the riders between runs. This technique allowed the mail to be moved across the continent in record time. Each rider rode about per day.\nFirst journeys.\nWestbound.\nThe first westbound Pony Express trip left St. Joseph on April 3, 1860, and arrived 10 days later in Sacramento, California, on April 14. These letters were sent under cover from the east to St. Joseph, and never directly entered the U.S. mail system. Today, only a single letter is known to exist from the inaugural westbound trip from St. Joseph to Sacramento. It was delivered in an envelope embossed with postage (depicted below) that was first issued by the U.S. Post Office in 1855.\nThe messenger delivering the \"mochila\" from New York and Washington, DC, missed a connection in Detroit and arrived in Hannibal, Missouri, two hours late. The railroad cleared the track and dispatched a special locomotive called \"Missouri\" with a one-car train to make the trek across Missouri in a record 4 hours and 51 minutes, an average of . It arrived at Olive and 8th Street, a few blocks from the company's new headquarters in a hotel at Patee House at 12th and Penn Street, St. Joseph, and the company's nearby stables on Penn Street. The first pouch contained 49 letters, five private telegrams, and some papers for San Francisco and intermediate points.\nSt. Joseph Mayor M. Jeff Thompson, William H. Russell, and Alexander Majors gave speeches before the \"mochila\" was handed off. The ride began at about 7:15\u00a0pm. The \"St. Joseph Gazette\" was the only newspaper included in the bag.\nThe identity of the first rider has long been in dispute. The St. Joseph \"Weekly West\" (April 4, 1860) reported Johnson William Richardson was the first rider.\nJohnny Fry is credited in some sources as the rider. Nonetheless, the first westbound rider carried the pouch across the Missouri River ferry to Elwood, Kansas. The first horse-ridden leg of the Express was only about from the Express stables/railroad area to the Missouri River ferry at the foot of Jules Street. Reports indicated that horse and rider crossed the river. In later rides, the courier crossed the river without a horse and picked up his mount at a stable on the other side.\nThe first westbound \"mochila\" reached Sacramento, on April 14, at 1:00\u00a0am.\nEastbound.\nThe first eastbound Pony Express trip left Sacramento on April 3, 1860, and arrived at its destination 10 days later in St. Joseph, Missouri. From St. Joseph, letters were placed in the U.S. mails for delivery to eastern destinations. Only two letters are known to exist from the inaugural eastbound trip.\nMail.\nAs the Pony Express mail service existed only briefly in 1860 and 1861, few examples of Pony Express mail survive. Contributing to the scarcity of Pony Express mail is that the cost to send a letter was $5.00 at the beginning (, or 2&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442 days of semi-skilled labor). By the end of the Pony Express, the price had dropped to $1.00 per &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442 ounce but even that was considered expensive to mail one letter. Only 250 known examples of Pony Express mail remain.\nPostmarks.\nVarious postmarks were added to the mail to be carried by the Pony Express at the point of departure.\nFastest mail service.\nWilliam Russell, senior partner of Russell, Majors, and Waddell, and one of the biggest investors in the Pony Express, used the 1860 presidential election, of Abraham Lincoln, as a way to promote the Pony Express and how fast it could deliver the U.S. Mail. This was an important event because just four years earlier, in the prior election, it took months to get news of James Buchanan's win. The election of Lincoln was important because the newly-named president would have to take the country into the Civil War. Prior to the election, Russell hired extra riders to ensure that fresh riders and relay horses were available along the route. On November 7, 1860, a Pony Express rider departed Fort Kearny, Nebraska Territory (the end of the eastern telegraph line) with the election results. Riders briskly traversed the route, over snow-covered trails to Fort Churchill, Nevada Territory (the end of the western telegraph line). California's newspapers received word of Lincoln's election only 7 days and 17 hours after the East Coast papers, an \"unrivaled feat at the time\".\nAttacks.\nThe Paiute War was a minor series of raids and ambushes initiated by American expansion into the territory of the Paiute Indian tribe in Nevada, which resulted in the disruption of mail services of the Pony Express. It took place from May through June 1860, though sporadic violence continued for a period afterward.\nIn the brief history of the Pony Express, only once did the mail not go through. After completing eight weekly trips from both Sacramento and Saint Joseph, the Pony Express was forced to suspend mail services because of the outbreak of the Paiute Indian War in May 1860.\nAbout 6,000 Paiutes in Nevada had suffered during a winter of fierce blizzards that year. By spring, the whole tribe was ready to embark on a war, except for the Paiute chief named Numaga. For three days, Numaga fasted and argued for peace.\nMeanwhile, a raiding party attacked Williams Station, a Pony Express station located on the then Carson River under present-day Lake Lahontan (reservoir), not to be confused with the large endorheic Pleistocene lake of the same name (Lake Lahontan). One account says the raid was a deliberate attempt to provoke war. Another says the raiders had heard that men at the station had kidnapped two Paiute women, and fighting broke out when they went to investigate and free the women. Either way, the war party killed five men and the station was burned.\nDuring the following weeks, other isolated incidents occurred when whites in the Paiute country were ambushed and killed. The Pony Express was a special target. Seven other express stations were also attacked; 16 employees were killed, and around 150 express horses were either stolen or driven off. Those who worked at the stations had no one around, possibly for miles, to help defend against the attacks, making working at the stations one of the deadliest jobs in the whole operation. The Paiute War cost the Pony Express company about $75,000 &amp;lpar;&amp;dollar;\u00a0in &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Tooltip/styles.css\" /&gt;) in livestock and station equipment, not to mention the loss of life. In June of that year, the Paiute uprising had been ended through the intervention of U.S. troops, after which four delayed mail shipments from the East were finally brought to San Francisco on June 25, 1860.\nDuring this brief war, one Pony Express mailing, which left San Francisco on July 21, 1860, did not immediately reach its destination. That mail pouch (\"mochila\") did not reach St. Joseph and subsequently New York until almost two years later.\nFamous riders.\nIn 1860, riding for the Pony Express was difficult work\u00a0\u2013 riders had to be tough and lightweight. An advertisement allegedly read, \"Wanted: Young, skinny, wiry fellows not over eighteen. Must be expert riders, willing to risk death daily. Orphans preferred,\" but one historian, Joseph Nardone, claims that it is a hoax (dating no earlier than 1902), as no one has found the ad in contemporary newspaper archives.\nThe Pony Express had an estimated 80 riders traveling east or west along the route at any given time. In addition, about 400 other employees were used, including station keepers, stock tenders, and route superintendents. Many young men applied; Waddell and Majors could have easily hired riders at low rates, but instead offered $100 a month\u00a0\u2013 a handsome sum for that time. Author Mark Twain described the riders in his travel memoir \"Roughing It\" as: \"...\u00a0usually a little bit of a man\". Though the riders were small, lightweight, generally teenaged boys, they came to be seen as heroes of the American West. There was no systematic list of riders kept by the company, but a partial list has been compiled by Raymond and Nancy Settle in their \"Saddles &amp; Spurs\" (1972).\nWild Bill Hickok never worked as a rider and only worked as a stocktender for the Pony Express.\nFirst riders.\nThe identity of the first westbound rider to depart St. Joseph has been disputed, but currently most historians have narrowed it down to either Johnny Fry or Billy Richardson. Both Expressmen were hired at St. Joseph for A. E. Lewis' Division, which ran from St. Joseph to Seneca, Kansas, a distance of . They covered at an average speed of , including all stops. Before the mail pouch was delivered to the first rider on April 3, 1860, time was taken out for ceremonies and several speeches. First, Mayor M. Jeff Thompson gave a brief speech on the significance of the event for St. Joseph. Then William H. Russell and Alexander Majors addressed the gala crowd about how the Pony Express was just a \"precursor\" to the construction of a transcontinental railroad. At the conclusion of all the speeches, around 7:15\u00a0pm, Russell turned the mail pouch over to the first rider. A cannon fired, the large assembled crowd cheered, and the rider dashed to the landing at the foot of Jules Street, where the ferry boat \"Denver\", under a full head of steam, alerted by the signal cannon, waited to carry the horse and rider across the Missouri River to Elwood, Kansas Territory. On April 9 at 6:45\u00a0pm, the first rider from the east reached Salt Lake City, Utah. Then, on April 12, the mail pouch reached Carson City, Nevada Territory, at 2:30\u00a0pm. The riders raced over the Sierra Nevada, through Placerville, California, and on to Sacramento. Around midnight on April 14, 1860, the first mail pouch was delivered by the Pony Express to San Francisco. With it was a letter of congratulations from President Buchanan to California Governor Downey along with other official government communications, newspapers from New York, Chicago, and St. Louis, and other important mail to banks and commercial houses in San Francisco. In all, 85 pieces of mail were delivered on this first trip.\nJames Randall is credited as \"the first eastbound rider\" from the San Francisco Alta telegraph office, since he was on the steamship \"\" to go to Sacramento. Mail for the Pony Express left San Francisco at 4:00\u00a0pm, carried by horse and rider to the waterfront, and then on by steamboat to Sacramento, where it was picked up by the Pony Express rider. At 2:45\u00a0am, William (Sam) Hamilton was the first Pony Express rider to begin the journey from Sacramento. He rode all the way to Sportsman Hall Station, where he gave his \"mochila \"filled with mail to Warren Upson. A California Registered Historical Landmark plaque at the site reads:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This was the site of Sportsman's Hall, also known as the Twelve-Mile House. The hotel was operated in the late 1850s and 1860s by John and James Blair. A stopping place for stages and teams of the Comstock, it became a relay station of the central overland Pony Express. Here, at 7:40\u00a0am, April 4, 1860, Pony rider William (Sam) Hamilton, riding in from Placerville, handed the Express mail to Warren Upson who, two minutes later, sped on his way eastward.\u2014\u200a\nWilliam Cody.\nProbably more than any other rider in the Pony Express, William Cody (better known as Buffalo Bill) epitomizes the legend and the folklore, be it fact or fiction, of the Pony Express. Numerous stories have been told of young Cody's adventures as a Pony Express rider, though his accounts may have been fabricated or exaggerated. At age 15, Cody was on his way west to California when he met Pony Express agents along the way and signed on with the company. Cody helped in the construction of several way-stations. Thereafter, he was employed as a rider and was given a short delivery run from the township of Julesburg, which lay to the west. After some months, he was transferred to Slade's Division in Wyoming, where he is said to have made the longest nonstop ride from Red Buttes Station to Rocky Ridge Station and back when he found that his relief rider had been killed. This trail of was completed in 21 hours and 40 minutes, and 21 horses were required. On one occasion when he is said to have carried mail, he unintentionally ran into an Indian war party, but managed to escape. Cody was present for many significant chapters in early western history, including the gold rush, the building of the railroads, and cattle herding on the Great Plains. A career as a scout for the Army under General Phillip Sheridan following the Civil War earned him his nickname and established his notoriety as a frontiersman.\nRobert Haslam.\n\"Pony Bob\" Haslam was among the most brave, resourceful, and best-known riders of the Pony Express. He was born in January 1840 in London, United Kingdom, and came to the United States as a teenager. Haslam was hired by Bolivar Roberts, helped build the stations, and was given the mail run from Friday's Station at Lake Tahoe to Buckland's Station near Fort Churchill, to the east.\nHis greatest ride, in 8 hours and 20 minutes while wounded, was an important contribution to the fastest trip ever made by the Pony Express. The mail carried Lincoln's inaugural address. Indian problems in 1860 led to Haslam's record-breaking ride. He had received the eastbound mail (probably the May 10 mail from San Francisco) at Friday's Station. When he reached Buckland's Station, his relief rider was so badly frightened over the Indian threat that he refused to take the mail. Haslam agreed to take the mail all the way to Smith's Creek for a total distance of without a rest. After a rest of 9 hours, he retraced his route with the westbound mail, where at Cold Springs, he found that Indians had raided the place, killing the station keeper and running off all of the stock. On the ride, he was shot through the jaw with an Indian arrow, losing three teeth.\nFinally, he reached Buckland's Station, making the round trip the longest on record.\nPony Bob continued to work as a rider for Wells Fargo and Company after the Civil War, scouted for the U.S. Army well into his 50s, and later accompanied his good friend \"Buffalo Bill\" Cody on a diplomatic mission to negotiate the surrender of Chief Sitting Bull in December 1890. He drifted in and out of public mention, but died in Chicago during the winter of 1912 (age 72) in deep poverty after suffering a stroke. Buffalo Bill paid for his friend's headstone at Mount Greenwood Cemetery (111 Street and Sacramento) on Chicago's far south side.\nJack Keetley.\nJack Keetley was hired by A. E. Lewis for his division at the age of 19 and put on the run from Marysville to Big Sandy. He was one of those who rode for the Pony Express during the entire 19 months of its existence.\nJack Keetley's longest ride, upon which he doubled back for another rider, ended at Seneca, where he was taken from the saddle sound asleep. He had ridden in 31 hours without stopping to rest or eat. After the Pony Express was disbanded, Keetley went to Salt Lake City, where he engaged in mining. He died there on October 12, 1912, where he was also buried.\nIn 1907, Keetley wrote the following letter (excerpt):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Alex Carlyle was the first man to ride the Pony Express out of St. Joe. He was a nephew of the superintendent of the stage line to Denver, called the \"Pike's Peak Express\". The superintendent's name was Ben Ficklin. Carlyle was a consumptive, and could not stand the hardships, and retired after about two months' trial, and died within about six months after retiring. John Frye was the second rider, and I was the third, and Gus Cliff was the fourth.I made the longest ride without a stop, only to change horses. It was said to be 300 miles and was done a few minutes inside of twenty-four hours. I do not vouch for the distance being correct, as I only have it from the division superintendent, A.E. Lewis, who said that the distance given was taken by his English roadometer which was attached to the front wheel of his buggy which he used to travel over his division with, and which was from St. Joe to Fort Kearney.\u2014\u200a\nBilly Tate.\nBilly Tate was a 14-year-old Pony Express rider who rode the express trail in Nevada near Ruby Valley. During the Paiute uprising of 1860, he was chased by a band of Paiute Indians on horseback and was forced to retreat into the hills behind some big rocks, where he killed seven of his assailants in a shoot-out before being killed himself. His body was found riddled with arrows, but was not scalped, a sign that the Paiutes honored their enemy.\nMajor Howard Egan.\nEgan emigrated to the United States from Ireland with his parents in the early 1830s. While living in Massachusetts, he joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. He was with the pioneer party of 1847 that journeyed to the west to modern day Salt Lake City, Utah. At the start of the Pony Express, he was appointed Superintendent of the Division from Salt Lake City to Robert's Creek which is in present day Nevada. Egan filled in when others couldn't ride. After the Pony Express, he ranched and became involved with the court system in Utah.\nHorses.\nAt the west end of the Pony Express route in California, W.W. Finney purchased 100 head of short-coupled stock called \"California horses\", while A.B. Miller purchased another 200 native ponies in and around the Great Salt Lake Valley. The horses were ridden quickly between stations, a distance of . They were then relieved, and a fresh horse was exchanged for the one that just arrived from its strenuous run.\nDuring his route of , a Pony Express rider would change horses 8 to 10 times. The horses were ridden at a fast canter of around and at times they were driven to full gallop at speeds up to . Horses of the Pony Express were purchased in Missouri, Iowa, California, and some western U.S. territories.\nThe types of horses ridden by riders of the Pony Express included Morgans and thoroughbreds, which were often used on the eastern end of the trail. Mustangs were often used on the western (more rugged) end of the mail route.\nSaddle.\nIn 1844, years before the Pony Express came to St. Joseph, Israel Landis opened a small saddle and harness shop there. His business expanded as the town grew, and when the Pony Express came to town, Landis was the ideal candidate to produce saddles for the newly founded Pony Express. Because Pony Express riders rode their horses at a quick pace over a distance of or more between stations, every consideration was made to reduce the overall weight the horse had to carry. To help reduce this load, special lightweight saddles were designed and crafted. Using less leather and fewer metallic and wood components, they fashioned a saddle that was similar in design to the regular stock saddle generally in use in the West at that time.\nThe mail pouch was a separate component to the saddle that made the Pony Express unique. Standard mail pouches for horses were never used because of their size and shape, as detaching and attaching it from one saddle to the other was time-consuming, causing undue delay in changing mounts. With many stops to make, the delayed time at each station would accumulate to appreciable proportions. To get around this difficulty, a \"mochila\" (a covering of leather) was thrown over the saddle. The saddle horn and cantle projected through holes that were specially cut to size in the \"mochila\". Attached to the broad leather skirt of the \"mochila\" were four \"cantinas\", or box-shaped hard leather compartments, where letters were carried on the journey.\nClosing.\nDuring its brief time in operation, the Pony Express delivered about 35,000 letters between St. Joseph and Sacramento. Although the Pony Express proved that the central/northern mail route was viable, Russell, Majors, and Waddell did not get the contract to deliver mail over the route. The contract was instead awarded to Jeremy Dehut in March 1861, who had taken over the southern, congressionally favored Butterfield Overland Mail Stage Line. The so-called \"Stagecoach King\", Ben Holladay, acquired the Russell, Majors, and Waddell stations for his stagecoaches.\nShortly after the contract was awarded, the start of the American Civil War caused the stage line to cease operation. From March 1861, the Pony Express ran mail only between Salt Lake City and Sacramento. The Pony Express announced its closure on October 26, 1861, two days after the transcontinental telegraph reached Salt Lake City and connected Omaha, Nebraska, and Sacramento. Other telegraph lines connected points along the line and other cities on the east and west coasts.\nDespite the subsidy, the Pony Express was a financial failure. It grossed $90,000 and lost $200,000.\nIn 1866, after the Civil War was over, Holladay sold the Pony Express assets along with the remnants of the Butterfield Stage to Wells Fargo for $1.5\u00a0million.\nLegacy.\nPostage stamps.\nIn 1869, the United States Post Office issued the first U.S. postage stamp to depict an actual historic event, and the subject chosen was the Pony Express. Until then, only the faces of George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and Andrew Jackson were found on the face of U.S. postage. Sometimes mistaken for an actual stamp used by the Pony Express, the \"Pony Express Stamp\" issue was released in 1869 (8 years after the Pony Express service had ended) to honor the men who rode the long and sometimes dangerous journeys and to commemorate the service they provided for the nation. In 1940 and 1960, commemorative stamps were issued for the 80th and 100th anniversaries of the Pony Express, respectively.\nHistorical research.\nThe foundation of accountable Pony Express history rests in the few tangible areas where records, papers, letters, and mailings have yielded the most historical evidence. Until the 1950s, most of what was known about the short-lived Pony Express was the product of a few accounts, hearsay, and folklore, generally true in their overall aspects, but lacking in verification in many areas for those who wanted to explore the history surrounding the founders, the various riders, and station keepers, or who were interested in stations or forts along the Pony Express route.\nThe most complete books on the Pony Express are \"The Story of the Pony Express\" by Raymond and Mary Settle and \"Saddles and Spurs\" by Roy Bloss. Settle's account is unique, as he was the first writer and historical researcher to make use of Pony Express founder William B. Waddell's papers, now in a collection at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California. Mr. Settle wrote in the mid-1950s. Mr. Bloss was a writer for the Pony Express Centennial. While Settle's work was published generally without his annotations and notes, the writer's background here is unique and Settle does have an excellent bibliography. When Settle prepared to publish his well-researched account, he had a good volume of footnotes, citations prepared, but the editors chose not to use most of them. Instead, they opted for a less expensive approach to print and publish and released an accurate, but simplified account. Settle was not pleased with this new and sudden development, as he put much time and effort into the annotations. Yet, the account Settle wrote was and is a definitive one and is considered the best account on the history of the Pony Express among many historians.\nNational Historic Trail.\nThe Pony Express route was designated the Pony Express National Historic Trail August 3, 1992, by an act of Congress. Its route goes through eight states and includes substantial sections of land managed by the Bureau of Land Management in California, Colorado, Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming.\nThe public can auto-tour the route, visit interpretive sites and museums, and hike, bike, or horseback ride various trail segments. Sites open to public visitation along the trail include the Sand Mountain Recreation Area in Nevada; automobile access to a backcountry byway (the Pony Express Trail National Back Country Byway) along the route itself, Boyd Station and Simpson Springs Campground in Utah; and the Little Sandy Crossing in Wyoming. In total, approximately 120 historic sites along the trail may eventually be open to the public, including 50 stations or station ruins.\nThe National Pony Express Association is a nonprofit, volunteer-led historical organization. Its purpose is to preserve the original Pony Express trail and to continue the memory and importance of Pony Express in American history in partnership with the National Park Service, Pony Express Trail Association, and Oregon-California Trails Association.\nOther commemorations.\nFrom 1866 until 1889, the Pony Express logo was used by stagecoach and freight company Wells Fargo, which provided secure mail service. Wells Fargo used the Pony Express logo for its guard and armored-car services. The logo continued to be used when other companies took over the security business into the 1990s. Since 2001, the Pony Express logo is no longer used for security businesses, since the business has been sold.\nIn June 2006, the United States Postal Service announced it had trademarked \"Pony Express\" along with \"Air Mail\".\nApril 3, 2010 was the Pony Express's 150th anniversary. Located in St. Joseph, Missouri, the Patee House Museum, which was the Pony Express's headquarters, hosted events celebrating the anniversary.\nOn April 14, 2015, Google released a playable doodle game celebrating their 155th anniversary.\nIn popular culture.\nThe continued remembrance and popularity of the Pony Express can be linked to Buffalo Bill Cody, his autobiographies, and his Wild West Show. The first book dedicated solely to the Pony Express was not published until 1900. However, in his first autobiography, published in 1879, Cody claims to have been an Express rider. While this claim has recently come under dispute, his show became the \"primary keeper of the pony legend\" when it premiered as a scene in the Wild West Show.\nTelevision.\nComic books\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Historians and theologians identify three, or sometimes four, waves of increased religious enthusiasm between the early 18th century and the late 20th century. Each of these \"Great Awakenings\" was characterized by widespread revivals led by evangelical Protestant ministers, a sharp increase of interest in religion, a profound sense of conviction and redemption on the part of those affected, an increase in evangelical church comradeship, and the formation of new religious movements and denominations.\nGeorge Whitefield, Jonathan Edwards, Gilbert Tennent, and the New Lights and the Old Lights highly influenced the First Great Awakening. \nThe First Great Awakening in the American colonies is closely related to the Evangelical Revival in the British Isles.\nPulling away from ritual and ceremony, the Great Awakening made religion more personal by fostering a sense of spiritual conviction of personal sin and need for redemption, and by encouraging introspection and a commitment to personal morality. It incited rancor and division between traditionalists, who insisted on the continuing importance of ritual and doctrine, and revivalists who encouraged emotional involvement and personal commitment. It had a major impact in reshaping the Congregational church, the Presbyterian church, the Dutch Reformed Church, and the German Reformed denomination, and strengthened the small Baptist and Methodist denominations. It had less impact on Anglicans and Quakers. Unlike the Second Great Awakening, which began about 1800 and reached out to the unchurched, the First Great Awakening focused on those who were already church members. It changed their rituals, their piety, and their self-awareness.\nFirst Great Awakening.\nThe First Great Awakening began in the 1730s and lasted to about 1740, though pockets of revivalism had occurred in years prior, especially amongst the ministry of Solomon Stoddard, Jonathan Edwards's grandfather. Edwards's congregation was involved in a revival later called the \"Frontier Revivals\" in the mid-1730s, though this was on the wane by 1737. But as American religious historian Sydney E. Ahlstrom noted, the Great Awakening \"was still to come, ushered in by the Grand Itinerant\", the British evangelist George Whitefield. Whitefield arrived in Georgia in 1738 and returned in 1739 for a second visit of the Colonies, making a \"triumphant campaign north from Philadelphia to New York, and back to the South\". In 1740, he visited New England, and \"at every place he visited, the consequences were large and tumultuous\". Ministers from various evangelical Protestant denominations supported the Great Awakening. In the middle colonies, he influenced not only the British churches, but the Dutch and German.\nAdditionally, pastoral styles began to change. In the late colonial period, most pastors read their sermons, which were theologically dense and advanced a particular theological argument or interpretation. Nathan O. Hatch argues that the evangelical movement of the 1740s played a key role in the development of democratic thought, as well as the belief of the free press and the belief that information should be shared and completely unbiased and uncontrolled. Micha\u0142 Choi\u0144ski argues that the First Great Awakening marks the birth of the American \"rhetoric of the revival\" understood as \"a particular mode of preaching in which the speaker employs and it has a really wide array of patterns and communicative strategies to initiate religious conversions and spiritual regeneration among the hearers\". All these theological, social, and rhetorical notions ushered in the period of the American Revolution. This contributed to create a demand for religious freedom. The Great Awakening represented the first time African Americans embraced Christianity in large numbers.\nIn the later part of the 1700s, the Revival came to the English colonies of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island primarily through the efforts of Henry Alline and his New Light movement.\nSecond Great Awakening.\nThe Second Great Awakening (sometimes known simply as \"the Great Awakening\") was a religious revival that occurred in the United States beginning in the late eighteenth century and lasting until the middle of the nineteenth century. While it occurred in all parts of the United States, it was especially strong in the Northeast and the Midwest. This awakening was unique in that it moved beyond the educated elite of New England to those who were less wealthy and less educated. The center of revivalism was the so-called burned-over district in western New York. Named for its overabundance of hellfire-and-damnation preaching, the region produced dozens of new denominations, communal societies, and reform.\nAmong these dozens of new denominations were free black churches, run independently of existing congregations that were predominantly of white attendance. During the period between the American revolution and the 1850s, black involvement in largely white churches declined in great numbers, with participation becoming almost non-existent by the 1840s\u20131850s; some scholars argue that this was largely due to racial discrimination within the church. This discrimination came in the form of segregated seating and the forbiddance of African Americans from voting in church matters or holding leadership positions in many white churches. Reverend Richard Allen, a central founder of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, was quoted describing one such incident of racial discrimination in a predominantly white church in Philadelphia, in which fellow preacher and a former slave from Delaware, Absalom Jones, was grabbed by a white church trustee in the midst of prayer and forcefully told to leave.\nClosely related to the Second Great Awakening were other reform movements such as temperance, abolition, and women's rights. The temperance movement encouraged people to abstain from consuming alcoholic drinks in order to preserve family order. The abolition movement fought to abolish slavery in the United States. The women's rights movement grew from female abolitionists who realized that they could fight for their own political rights, too. In addition to these causes, reforms touched nearly every aspect of daily life, such as restricting the use of tobacco and dietary and dress reforms. The abolition movement emerged in the North from the wider Second Great Awakening 1800\u20131840.\nThird Great Awakening.\nThe Third Great Awakening in the 1850s\u20131900s was characterized by new denominations, active missionary work, Chautauquas, and the Social Gospel approach to social issues. The YMCA (founded in 1844) played a major role in fostering revivals in the cities in the 1858 Awakening and after. The revival of 1858 produced leaders such as Dwight L. Moody who carried out religious work in the Civil War armies. The Christian and Sanitary Commissions and numerous Freedmen's Societies were also formed during the war.\nFourth Great Awakening.\nThe Fourth Great Awakening is a debated concept that has not received the acceptance of the first three. Advocates such as economist Robert Fogel say it happened in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The Jesus Movement is cited as evidence of this awakening, and it created a shift in church music styles.\nMainline Protestant denominations weakened sharply in both membership and influence while the most conservative religious denominations (such as the Southern Baptists) grew rapidly in numbers, spread across the United States, had grave internal theological battles and schisms, and became politically powerful.\nTerminology.\nThe idea of an \"awakening\" implies a slumber or passivity during secular or less religious times. Awakening is a term which originates from, and is embraced often and primarily by, evangelical Christians. In recent times, the idea of \"awakenings\" in United States history has been put forth by conservative American evangelicals.\nIn the late 2010s and 2020s the term \"Great Awakening\" has been used by promoters of the QAnon conspiracy theory to denote awareness of their theory.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It spread religion through revivals and emotional preaching and sparked a number of schismatic movements. Revivals were key to the movement and attracted hundreds of converts to new denominations. The Methodist Church used circuit riders to reach people in frontier locations.\nThe Second Great Awakening led to a period of antebellum social reform and an emphasis on salvation by institutions. The outpouring of religious fervor and revival began in Kentucky and Tennessee in the 1790s and early 1800s among the Presbyterians, Methodists, and Baptists. New religious movements emerged during the Second Great Awakening, such as Adventism, Dispensationalism, and the Latter Day Saint movement. The Second Great Awakening also led to the founding of several well-known colleges, seminaries, and mission societies.\nHistorians named the Second Great Awakening in the context of the First Great Awakening of the 1730s and 1750s and of the Third Great Awakening of the late 1850s to early 1900s. The First Awakening was part of a much larger evangelical religious movement that was sweeping across England, Scotland, and Germany.\nSpread of revivals.\nBackground.\nThe Second Great Awakening in North America rejected the skepticism, deism, Unitarianism, and rationalism left over from the American Enlightenment, about the same time that similar movements flourished in Europe. Pietism was sweeping Germanic countries and evangelicalism was waxing strong in England.\nThe Second Great Awakening occurred in several episodes and over different denominations; however, the revivals were very similar. As the most effective form of evangelizing during this period, revival meetings cut across geographical boundaries. The movement quickly spread throughout Kentucky, Indiana, Tennessee, and southern Ohio, as well as other regions of the United States and Canada. Each denomination had assets that allowed it to thrive on the frontier. The Methodists had an efficient organization that depended on itinerant ministers, known as circuit riders, who sought out people in remote frontier locations. The circuit riders came from among the common people, which helped them establish rapport with the frontier families they hoped to convert.\nTheology.\nPostmillennialist theology dominated American Protestantism in the first half of the 19th century. Postmillennialists believed that Christ will return to earth after the \"Millennium\", which could entail either a literal 1,000 years or a figurative \"long period\" of peace and happiness. Christians thus had a duty to purify society in preparation for that return. This duty extended beyond American borders to include Christian Restorationism. George Fredrickson argues that Postmillennial theology \"was an impetus to the promotion of Progressive reforms, as historians have frequently pointed out.\" During the Second Great Awakening of the 1830s, some diviners expected the Millennium to arrive in a few years. By the late 1840s, however, the great day had receded to the distant future, and postmillennialism became a more passive religious dimension of the wider middle-class pursuit of reform and progress.\nBurned-over district.\nBeginning in the 1820s, Western New York State experienced a series of popular religious revivals that would later earn this region the nickname \"the burned-over district,\" which implied the area was set ablaze with spiritual fervor. This term, however, was not used by contemporaries in the first half of the nineteenth century, as it originates from Charles Grandison Finney's \"Autobiography of Charles G Finney\" (1876), in which he writes, \"I found that region of country what, in the western phrase, would be called, a 'burnt district.' There had been, a few years previously, a wild excitement passing through that region, which they called a revival of religion, but which turned out to be spurious.\" During this period, a number of nonconformist, folk religion, and evangelical sects flourished in the region.\nThe extent to which religious fervor actually affected the region was reassessed in last quarter of the twentieth century. Linda K. Pritchard used statistical data to show that compared to the rest of New York State, the Ohio River Valley in the lower Midwest, and the country as a whole, the religiosity of the Burned-over District was typical rather than exceptional. More recent works, however, have argued that these revivals in Western New York had a unique and lasting impact upon the religious and social life of the entire nation.\nWest and Tidewater South.\nOn the American frontier, evangelical denominations, especially Methodists and Baptists, sent missionary preachers and exhorters to meet the people in the backcountry in an effort to support the growth of church membership and the formation of new congregations. Another key component of the revivalists' techniques was the camp meeting. These outdoor religious gatherings originated from field meetings and the Scottish Presbyterians' \"Holy Fairs\", which were brought to America in the mid-eighteenth century from Ireland, Scotland, and Britain's border counties. Most of the Scotch-Irish immigrants before the American Revolutionary War settled in the backcountry of Pennsylvania and down the spine of the Appalachian Mountains in present-day Maryland and Virginia, where Presbyterian emigrants and Baptists held large outdoor gatherings in the years prior to the war. The Presbyterians and Methodists sponsored similar gatherings on a regular basis after the Revolution.\nThe denominations that encouraged the revivals were based on an interpretation of man's spiritual equality before God, which led them to recruit members and preachers from a wide range of classes and all races. Baptists and Methodist revivals were successful in some parts of the Tidewater South, where an increasing number of common planters, plain folk, and slaves were converted.\nWest.\nIn the newly settled frontier regions, the revival was implemented through camp meetings. These often provided the first encounter for some settlers with organized religion, and they were important as social venues. The camp meeting was a religious service of several days' length with preachers. Settlers in thinly populated areas gathered at the camp meeting for fellowship as well as worship. The sheer exhilaration of participating in a religious revival with crowds of hundreds and perhaps thousands of people inspired the dancing, shouting, and singing associated with these events. The revivals also followed an arc of great emotional power, with an emphasis on the individual's sins and need to turn to Christ, and a sense of restoring personal salvation. This differed from the Calvinists' belief in predestination as outlined in the Westminster Confession of Faith, which emphasized the inability of men to save themselves and decreed that the only way to be saved was by God's electing grace. Upon their return home, most converts joined or created small local churches, which grew rapidly.\nThe Revival of 1800 in Logan County, Kentucky, began as a traditional Presbyterian sacramental occasion. The first informal camp meeting began in June, when people began camping on the grounds of the Red River Meeting House. Subsequent meetings followed at the nearby Gasper River and Muddy River congregations. All three of these congregations were under the ministry of Presbyterian Reverend James McGready. A year later, in August 1801, an even larger sacrament occasion that is generally considered to be America's first camp meeting was held at Cane Ridge in Bourbon County, Kentucky, under Barton W. Stone (1772\u20131844) with numerous Presbyterian, Baptist, and Methodist ministers participating in the services. The six-day gathering attracting perhaps as many as 20,000 people, although the exact number of attendees was not formally recorded. Due to the efforts of such leaders as Stone and Alexander Campbell (1788\u20131866), the camp meeting revival spread religious enthusiasm and became a major mode of church expansion, especially for the Methodists and Baptists. Presbyterians and Methodists initially worked together to host the early camp meetings, but the Presbyterians eventually became less involved because of the noise and often raucous activities that occurred during the protracted sessions.\nAs a result of the Revival of 1800, the Cumberland Presbyterian Church was founded in 1810 near Dickson, Tennessee by the Revs: Samuel McAdow, Finis Ewing, and Samuel King and became a strong supporter of the revivalist movement. Cane Ridge was also instrumental in fostering what became known as the Restoration Movement, which consisted of non-denominational churches committed to what they viewed as the original, fundamental Christianity of the New Testament. Churches with roots in this movement include the Churches of Christ, Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), and the Evangelical Christian Church in Canada. The congregations of these denomination were committed to individuals' achieving a personal relationship with Christ.\nChurch membership soars.\nThe Methodist circuit riders and local Baptist preachers made enormous gains in increasing church membership. To a lesser extent the Presbyterians also gained members, particularly with the Cumberland Presbyterian Church in sparsely settled areas. As a result, the numerical strength of the Baptists and Methodists rose relative to that of the denominations dominant in the colonial period\u2014the Anglicans, Presbyterians, Congregationalists. Among the new denominations that grew from the religious ferment of the Second Great Awakening are the Latter Day Saint movement, Restoration Movement, Jehovah's Witnesses, Churches of Christ, Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and the Evangelical Christian Church in Canada.\nThe converts during the Second Great Awakening were predominantly female. A 1932 source estimated at least three female converts to every two male converts between 1798 and 1826. Young people (those under 25) also converted in greater numbers, and were the first to convert.\nNew movements.\nAdventism.\nThe Advent Movement emerged in the 1830s and 1840s in North America, and was preached by ministers such as William Miller, whose followers became known as Millerites. The name refers to belief in the soon Second Advent of Jesus (popularly known as the Second coming) and resulted in several major religious denominations, including Seventh-day Adventists, Advent Christians, and Jehovah's Witnesses.\nHoliness movement.\nThough its roots are in the First Great Awakening and earlier, a re-emphasis on Wesleyan teachings on sanctification emerged during the Second Great Awakening, leading to a distinction between Mainline Methodism and Holiness churches.\nRestoration Movement.\nThe idea of restoring a \"primitive\" form of Christianity grew in popularity in the U.S. after the American Revolution. This desire to restore a purer form of Christianity without an elaborate hierarchy contributed to the development of many groups during the Second Great Awakening, including the Latter Day Saints and Shakers. Several factors made the restoration sentiment particularly appealing during this time period:\nThe Restoration Movement began during, and was greatly influenced by, the Second Great Awakening. While the leaders of one of the two primary groups making up this movement, Thomas Campbell and Alexander Campbell, resisted what they saw as the spiritual manipulation of the camp meetings, the revivals contributed to the development of the other major branch, led by Barton W. Stone. The Southern phase of the Awakening \"was an important matrix of Barton Stone's reform movement\" and shaped the evangelistic techniques used by both Stone and the Campbells.\nCulture and society.\nEfforts to apply Christian teaching to the resolution of social problems presaged the Social Gospel of the late 19th century. Converts were taught that to achieve salvation they needed not just to repent personal sin but also work for the moral perfection of society, which meant eradicating sin in all its forms. Thus, evangelical converts were leading figures in a variety of 19th century reform movements.\nCongregationalists set up missionary societies to evangelize the western territory of the northern tier. Members of these groups acted as apostles for the faith, and also as educators and exponents of northeastern urban culture. The Second Great Awakening served as an \"organizing process\" that created \"a religious and educational infrastructure\" across the western frontier that encompassed social networks, a religious journalism that provided mass communication, and church-related colleges. Publication and education societies promoted Christian education; most notable among them was the American Bible Society, founded in 1816. Women made up a large part of these voluntary societies. The Female Missionary Society and the Maternal Association, both active in Utica, NY, were highly organized and financially sophisticated women's organizations responsible for many of the evangelical converts of the New York frontier.\nThere were also societies that broadened their focus from traditional religious concerns to larger societal ones. These organizations were primarily sponsored by affluent women. They did not stem entirely from the Second Great Awakening, but the revivalist doctrine and the expectation that one's conversion would lead to personal action accelerated the role of women's social benevolence work. Social activism influenced abolition groups and supporters of the Temperance movement. They began efforts to reform prisons and care for the handicapped and mentally ill. They believed in the perfectibility of people and were highly moralistic in their endeavors.\nAfrican Americans.\nBaptists and Methodists in the South preached to slaveholders and slaves alike. Conversions and congregations started with the First Great Awakening, resulting in Baptist and Methodist preachers being authorized among slaves and free African Americans more than a decade before 1800. \"Black Harry\" Hosier, an illiterate freedman who drove Francis Asbury on his circuits, proved to be able to memorize large passages of the Bible verbatim and became a cross-over success, as popular among white audiences as the black ones Asbury had originally intended for him to minister. His sermon at Thomas Chapel in Chapeltown, Delaware, in 1784 was the first to be delivered by a black preacher directly to a white congregation.\nDespite being called the \"greatest orator in America\" by Benjamin Rush and one of the best in the world by Bishop Thomas Coke, Hosier was repeatedly passed over for ordination and permitted no vote during his attendance at the Christmas Conference that formally established American Methodism. Richard Allen, the other black attendee, was ordained by the Methodists in 1799, but his congregation of free African Americans in Philadelphia left the church there because of its discrimination. They founded the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME) in Philadelphia. After first submitting to oversight by the established Methodist bishops, several AME congregations finally left to form the first independent African-American denomination in the United States in 1816. Soon after, the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church (AME Zion) was founded as another denomination in New York City.\nEarly Baptist congregations were formed by slaves and free African Americans in South Carolina and Virginia. Especially in the Baptist Church, African Americans were welcomed as members and as preachers. By the early 19th century, independent African-American congregations numbered in the several hundreds in some cities of the South, such as Charleston, South Carolina, and Richmond and Petersburg, Virginia. With the growth in congregations and churches, Baptist associations formed in Virginia, for instance, as well as Kentucky and other states.\nThe revival also inspired slaves to demand freedom. In 1800, out of African-American revival meetings in Virginia, a plan for slave rebellion was devised by Gabriel Prosser, although the rebellion was discovered and crushed before it started. Despite white attempts to control independent African-American congregations, especially after the Nat Turner uprising of 1831, a number of African-American congregations managed to maintain their separation as independent congregations in Baptist associations. State legislatures passed laws requiring them always to have a white man present at their worship meetings.\nWomen.\nWomen, who made up the majority of converts during the Awakening, played a crucial role in its development and focus. It is not clear why women converted in larger numbers than men. Various scholarly theories attribute the discrepancy to a reaction to the perceived sinfulness of youthful frivolity, an inherent greater sense of religiosity in women, a communal reaction to economic insecurity, or an assertion of the self in the face of patriarchal rule. Husbands, especially in the South, sometimes disapproved of their wives' conversion, forcing women to choose between submission to God or their spouses. Church membership and religious activity gave women peer support and place for meaningful activity outside the home, providing many women with communal identity and shared experiences.\nDespite the predominance of women in the movement, they were not formally indoctrinated or given leading ministerial positions. However, women took other public roles; for example, relaying testimonials about their conversion experience, or assisting sinners (both male and female) through the conversion process. Leaders such as Charles Finney saw women's public prayer as a crucial aspect in preparing a community for revival and improving their efficacy in conversion. Women also took crucial roles in the conversion and religious upbringing of children. During the period of revival, mothers were seen as the moral and spiritual foundation of the family, and were thus tasked with instructing children in matters of religion and ethics.\nThe greatest change in women's roles stemmed from participation in newly formalized missionary and reform societies. Women's prayer groups were an early and socially acceptable form of women's organization. In the 1830s, female moral reform societies rapidly spread across the North making it the first predominantly female social movement. Through women's positions in these organizations, women gained influence outside of the private sphere.\nChanging demographics of gender also affected religious doctrine. In an effort to give sermons that would resonate with the congregation, ministers stressed Christ's humility and forgiveness, in what the historian Barbara Welter calls a \"feminization\" of Christianity.\nPolitical implications.\nRevivals and perfectionist hopes of improving individuals and society continued to increase from 1840 to 1865 across all major denominations, especially in urban areas. Evangelists often directly addressed issues such as slavery, greed, and poverty, laying the groundwork for later reform movements. The influence of the Awakening continued in the form of more secular movements. In the midst of shifts in theology and church polity, American Christians began progressive movements to reform society during this period. Known commonly as , this phenomenon included reforms against the consumption of alcohol, for women's rights and abolition of slavery, and a multitude of other issues faced by society.\nThe religious enthusiasm of the Second Great Awakening was echoed by the new political enthusiasm of the Second Party System. More active participation in politics by more segments of the population brought religious and moral issues into the political sphere. The spirit of evangelical humanitarian reforms was carried on in the antebellum Whig party.\nHistorians stress the common understanding among participants of reform as being a part of God's plan. As a result, local churches saw their roles in society in purifying the world through the individuals to whom they could bring salvation, and through changes in the law and the creation of institutions. Interest in transforming the world was applied to mainstream political action, as temperance activists, antislavery advocates, and proponents of other variations of reform sought to implement their beliefs into national politics. While Protestant religion had previously played an important role on the American political scene, the Second Great Awakening strengthened the role it would play.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a small, swimming crustacean that lives in large schools, called swarms, sometimes reaching densities of 10,000\u201330,000 animals per cubic metre. It feeds directly on minute phytoplankton, thereby using the primary production energy that phytoplankton originally derive from the sun in order to sustain its pelagic life cycle. It grows to a length of , weighs up to , and can live for up to six years. A key species in the Antarctic ecosystem and in terms of biomass, \"E. superba\" is one of the most abundant animal species on the planet, with a cumulative biomass of approximately .\nLife cycle.\nThe main spawning season of Antarctic krill is from January to March, both above the continental shelf and also in the upper region of deep sea oceanic areas. In the typical way of all krill, the male attaches a spermatophore to the genital opening of the female. For this purpose, the first pleopods (legs attached to the abdomen) of the male are constructed as mating tools. Females lay 6,000\u201310,000 eggs at one time. They are fertilised as they pass out of the genital opening.\nAccording to the classical hypothesis of Marriosis De' Abrtona, derived from the results of the expedition of the famous British research vessel RRS \"Discovery\", egg development then proceeds as follows: gastrulation (development of egg into embryo) sets in during the descent of the eggs on the shelf at the bottom, in oceanic areas in depths around . The egg hatches as a nauplius larva; once this has moulted into a metanauplius, the young animal starts migrating towards the surface in a migration known as developmental ascent.\nThe next two larval stages, termed second nauplius and metanauplius, still do not eat but are nourished by the remaining yolk. After three weeks, the young krill has finished the ascent. They can appear in enormous numbers counting 2 per litre in water depth. Growing larger, additional larval stages follow (second and third calyptopis, first to sixth furcilia). They are characterised by increasing development of the additional legs, the compound eyes and the setae (bristles). At , the juvenile krill resembles the habitus of the adults. Krill reach maturity after two to three years. Like all crustaceans, krill must moult in order to grow. Approximately every 13 to 20 days, krill shed their chitinous exoskeleton and leave it behind as exuvia.\nFood.\nThe gut of \"E. superba\" can often be seen shining green through its transparent skin. This species feeds predominantly on phytoplankton\u2014especially very small diatoms (20 \u03bcm), which it filters from the water with a feeding basket. The glass-like shells of the diatoms are cracked in the gastric mill and then digested in the hepatopancreas. The krill can also catch and eat copepods, amphipods and other small zooplankton. The gut forms a straight tube; its digestive efficiency is not very high and therefore a lot of carbon is still present in the feces. Antarctic krill (\"E. superba\") primarily has chitinolytic enzymes in the stomach and mid-gut to break down chitinous spines on diatoms, additional enzymes can vary due to its expansive diet.\nIn aquaria, krill have been observed to eat each other. When they are not fed, they shrink in size after moulting, which is exceptional for animals this size. It is likely that this is an adaptation to the seasonality of their food supply, which is limited in the dark winter months under the ice. However, the animal's compound eyes do not shrink, and so the ratio between eye size and body length has thus been found to be a reliable indicator of starvation. A krill with ample food supply would have eyes proportional to body length, compared to a starving krill that would have eyes that appeared larger than what is normal. \nFilter feeding.\nAntarctic krill directly ingest minute phytoplankton cells, which no other animal of krill size can do. This is accomplished through filter feeding, using the krill's highly developed front legs which form an efficient filtering apparatus: the six thoracopods (legs attached to the thorax) create a \"feeding basket\" used to collect phytoplankton from the open water. In the finest areas the openings in this basket are only 1\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter. In lower food concentrations, the feeding basket is pushed through the water for over half a metre in an opened position, and then the algae are combed to the mouth opening with special setae (bristles) on the inner side of the thoracopods.\nIce-algae raking.\nAntarctic krill can scrape off the green lawn of ice algae from the underside of pack ice. Krill have developed special rows of rake-like setae at the tips of their thoracopods, and graze the ice in a zig-zag fashion. One krill can clear an area of a square foot in about 10\u00a0minutes (1.5\u00a0cm2/s). Recent discoveries have found that the film of ice algae is well developed over vast areas, often containing much more carbon than the whole water column below. Krill find an extensive energy source here, especially in the spring after food sources have been limited during the winter months.\nBiological pump and carbon sequestration.\nKrill are thought to undergo between one and three vertical migrations from mixed surface waters to depths of 100\u00a0m daily. The krill is a very untidy feeder, and it often spits out aggregates of phytoplankton (spitballs) containing thousands of cells sticking together. It also produces fecal strings that still contain significant amounts of carbon and glass shells of the diatoms. Both are heavy and sink very fast into the abyss. This process is called the biological pump. As the waters around Antarctica are very deep (), they act as a carbon dioxide sink: this process exports large quantities of carbon (fixed carbon dioxide, CO2) from the biosphere and sequesters it for about 1,000\u00a0years.\nIf the phytoplankton is consumed by other components of the pelagic ecosystem, most of the carbon remains in the upper layers of the ocean. There is speculation that this process is one of the largest biofeedback mechanisms of the planet, maybe the most sizable of all, driven by a gigantic biomass. Still more research is needed to quantify the Southern Ocean ecosystem.\nBiology.\nBioluminescence.\nKrill are often referred to as \"light-shrimp\" because they emit light through bioluminescent organs. These organs are located on various parts of the individual krill's body: one pair of organs at the eyestalk (cf. the image of the head above), another pair are on the hips of the second and seventh thoracopods, and singular organs on the four pleonsternites. These light organs emit a yellow-green light periodically, for up to 2\u20133\u00a0s. They are considered so highly developed that they can be compared with a flashlight. There is a concave reflector in the back of the organ and a lens in the front that guide the light produced. The whole organ can be rotated by muscles, which can direct the light to a specific area. The function of these lights is not yet fully understood; some hypotheses have suggested they serve to compensate the krill's shadow so that they are not visible to predators from below; other speculations maintain that they play a significant role in mating or schooling at night.\nThe krill's bioluminescent organs contain several fluorescent substances. The major component has a maximum fluorescence at an excitation of 355\u00a0nm and emission of 510\u00a0nm.\nEscape reaction.\nKrill use an escape reaction to evade predators, swimming backwards very quickly by flipping their rear ends. This swimming pattern is also known as lobstering. Krill can reach speeds of over . The trigger time to optical stimulus is, despite the low temperatures, only 55\u00a0ms.\nGenome.\nThe genome of \"E. superba\" spans about 48 GB and is thus one of the largest in the animal kingdom and the largest that has been assembled to date. Its content of repetitive DNA is about 70% and may reach up to 92.45% after additional repeat annotation, which is also the largest fraction known of any genome. There is no evidence of polyploidy. Shao et al. annotated 28,834 protein-coding genes in the Antarctic krill genome, which is similar to other animal genomes. The gene and intron lengths of Antarctic krill are notably shorter than those of lungfishes and Mexican axolotl, two other animals with giant genomes.\nGeographic distribution.\nAntarctic krill has a circumpolar distribution, being found throughout the Southern Ocean, and as far north as the Antarctic Convergence. At the Antarctic Convergence, the cold Antarctic surface water submerges below the warmer subantarctic waters. This front runs roughly at 55\u00b0 south; from there to the continent, the Southern Ocean covers 32 million square kilometres. This is 65 times the size of the North Sea. In the winter season, more than three-quarters of this area become covered by ice, whereas become ice free in summer. The water temperature fluctuates at .\nThe waters of the Southern Ocean form a system of currents. Whenever there is a West Wind Drift, the surface strata travels around Antarctica in an easterly direction. Near the continent, the East Wind Drift runs counterclockwise. At the front between both, large eddies develop, for example, in the Weddell Sea. The krill swarms swim with these water masses, to establish one single stock all around Antarctica, with gene exchange over the whole area. Currently, there is little knowledge of the precise migration patterns since individual krill cannot yet be tagged to track their movements. The largest shoals are visible from space and can be tracked by satellite. One swarm covered an area of of ocean, to a depth of and was estimated to contain over 2 million tons of krill. Recent research suggests that krill do not simply drift passively in these currents but actually modify them. By moving vertically through the ocean on a 12-hour cycle, the swarms play a major part in mixing deeper, nutrient-rich water with nutrient-poor water at the surface.\nEcology.\nAntarctic krill is the keystone species of the Antarctic ecosystem beyond the coastal shelf, and provides an important food source for whales, seals (such as leopard seals, fur seals, and crabeater seals), squid, icefish, penguins, albatrosses and many other species of birds. Crabeater seals have even developed special teeth as an adaptation to catch this abundant food source: its unusual multilobed teeth enable this species to sieve krill from the water. Its dentition looks like a perfect strainer, but how it operates in detail is still unknown. Crabeaters are the most abundant seal in the world; 98% of their diet is made up of \" E. superba\". These seals consume over 63 million tonnes of krill each year. Leopard seals have developed similar teeth (45% krill in diet). All seals consume 63\u2013130 million tonnes, all whales 34\u201343 million tonnes, birds 15\u201320 million tonnes, squid 30\u2013100 million tonnes, and fish 10\u201320 million tonnes, adding up to 152\u2013313 million tonnes of krill consumption each year.\nThe size step between krill and its prey is unusually large: generally it takes three or four steps from the 20\u00a0\u03bcm small phytoplankton cells to a krill-sized organism (via small copepods, large copepods, mysids to 5\u00a0cm fish).\n\"E. superba\" lives only in the Southern Ocean. In the North Atlantic, \"Meganyctiphanes norvegica\" and in the Pacific, \"Euphausia pacifica\" are the dominant species.\nBiomass and production.\nThe biomass of Antarctic krill was estimated in 2009 to be 0.05 gigatons of carbon (Gt C), similar to the total biomass of humans (0.06 Gt C). The reason Antarctic krill are able to build up such a high biomass and production is that the waters around the icy Antarctic continent harbour one of the largest plankton assemblages in the world, possibly \"the\" largest. The ocean is filled with phytoplankton; as the water rises from the depths to the light-flooded surface, it brings nutrients from all of the world's oceans back into the photic zone where they are once again available to living organisms.\nThus primary production\u2014the conversion of sunlight into organic biomass, the foundation of the food chain\u2014has an annual carbon fixation of 1\u20132\u00a0g/m2 in the open ocean. Close to the ice it can reach 30\u201350\u00a0g/m2. These values are not outstandingly high, compared to very productive areas like the North Sea or upwelling regions, but the area over which it takes place is enormous, even compared to other large primary producers such as rainforests. In addition, during the Austral summer there are many hours of daylight to fuel the process. All of these factors make the plankton and the krill a critical part of the planet's ecocycle.\nDecline with shrinking pack ice.\nA possible decline in Antarctic krill biomass may have been caused by the reduction of the pack ice zone due to global warming. Antarctic krill, especially in the early stages of development, seem to need the pack ice structures in order to have a fair chance of survival. The pack ice provides natural cave-like features which the krill uses to evade their predators. In the years of low pack ice conditions the krill tend to give way to salps, a barrel-shaped free-floating filter feeder that also grazes on plankton.\nOcean acidification.\nAnother challenge for Antarctic krill, as well as many calcifying organisms (corals, bivalve mussels, snails etc.), is the acidification of the oceans caused by increasing levels of carbon dioxide. Krill exoskeleton contains carbonate, which is susceptible to dissolution under low pH conditions. It has already been shown that increased carbon dioxide can disrupt the development of krill eggs and even prevent the juvenile krill from hatching, leading to future geographically widespread decreases in krill hatching success. The further effects of ocean acidification on the krill life cycle however remains unclear but scientists fear that it could significantly impact on its distribution, abundance and survival.\nFisheries.\nThe fishery of Antarctic krill is on the order of 100,000\u00a0tonnes per year. The major catching nations are South Korea, Norway, Japan and Poland. The products are used as animal food and fish bait. Krill fisheries are difficult to operate in two important respects. First, a krill net needs to have very fine meshes, producing a very high drag, which generates a bow wave that deflects the krill to the sides. Second, fine meshes tend to clog very fast.\nYet another problem is bringing the krill catch on board. When the full net is hauled out of the water, the organisms compress each other, resulting in great loss of the krill's liquids. Experiments have been carried out to pump krill, while still in water, through a large tube on board. Special krill nets also are currently under development. The processing of the krill must be very rapid since the catch deteriorates within several hours. Its high protein and vitamin content makes krill quite suitable for both direct human consumption and the animal-feed industry.\nFishing and potentially overfishing krill is an issue of increasing concern.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Frobenius inner product and norm arise frequently in matrix calculus and statistics.\nThe Frobenius inner product may be extended to a hermitian inner product on the complex vector space of all complex matrices of a fixed size, by replacing B by its complex conjugate.\nThe symmetry of the Frobenius inner product may be phrased more directly as follows: the matrices in the trace of a product can be switched without changing the result. If A and B are \"m\" \u00d7 \"n\" and \"n\" \u00d7 \"m\" real or complex matrices, respectively, then\nformula_9\nThis is notable both for the fact that AB does not usually equal BA, and also since the trace of either does not usually equal tr(A)tr(B). The similarity-invariance of the trace, meaning that tr(A) \n tr(P\u22121AP) for any square matrix A and any invertible matrix P of the same dimensions, is a fundamental consequence. This is proved by\nformula_10\nSimilarity invariance is the crucial property of the trace in order to discuss traces of linear transformations as below.\nAdditionally, for real column vectors formula_11 and formula_12, the trace of the outer product is equivalent to the inner product:\nformula_13\nCyclic property.\nMore generally, the trace is \"invariant under circular shifts\", that is,\nformula_14\nThis is known as the \"cyclic property\".\nArbitrary permutations are not allowed: in general,\nformula_15\nHowever, if products of \"three\" symmetric matrices are considered, any permutation is allowed, since:\nformula_16\nwhere the first equality is because the traces of a matrix and its transpose are equal. Note that this is not true in general for more than three factors.\nTrace of a Kronecker product.\nThe trace of the Kronecker product of two matrices is the product of their traces:\nformula_17\nCharacterization of the trace.\nThe following three properties:\nformula_18\ncharacterize the trace up to a scalar multiple in the following sense: If formula_19 is a linear functional on the space of square matrices that satisfies formula_20 then formula_19 and formula_22 are proportional.\nFor formula_23 matrices, imposing the normalization formula_24 makes formula_19 equal to the trace.\nTrace as the sum of eigenvalues.\nGiven any \"n\" \u00d7 \"n\" matrix A, there is\nformula_26\nwhere \u03bb1, ..., \u03bb\"n\" are the eigenvalues of A counted with multiplicity. This holds true even if A is a real matrix and some (or all) of the eigenvalues are complex numbers. This may be regarded as a consequence of the existence of the Jordan canonical form, together with the similarity-invariance of the trace discussed above.\nTrace of commutator.\nWhen both A and B are \"n\" \u00d7 \"n\" matrices, the trace of the (ring-theoretic) commutator of A and B vanishes: tr([A, B]) = 0, because tr(AB) = tr(BA) and tr is linear. One can state this as \"the trace is a map of Lie algebras gl\"n\" \u2192 \"k\" from operators to scalars\", as the commutator of scalars is trivial (it is an Abelian Lie algebra). In particular, using similarity invariance, it follows that the identity matrix is never similar to the commutator of any pair of matrices.\nConversely, any square matrix with zero trace is a linear combination of the commutators of pairs of matrices. Moreover, any square matrix with zero trace is unitarily equivalent to a square matrix with diagonal consisting of all zeros.\nRelationship to the characteristic polynomial.\nThe trace of an formula_27 matrix formula_28 is the coefficient of formula_29 in the characteristic polynomial, possibly changed of sign, according to the convention in the definition of the characteristic polynomial.\nRelationship to eigenvalues.\nIf A is a linear operator represented by a square matrix with real or complex entries and if \"\u03bb\"1, ..., \"\u03bbn\" are the eigenvalues of A (listed according to their algebraic multiplicities), then\nformula_30\nThis follows from the fact that A is always similar to its Jordan form, an upper triangular matrix having \"\u03bb\"1, ..., \"\u03bbn\" on the main diagonal. In contrast, the determinant of A is the \"product\" of its eigenvalues; that is,\nformula_31\nEverything in the present section applies as well to any square matrix with coefficients in an algebraically closed field.\nDerivative relationships.\nIf a is a square matrix \"with small entries\" and I denotes the identity matrix, then we have approximately\nformula_32\nPrecisely this means that the trace is the derivative of the determinant function at the identity matrix. Jacobi's formula \nformula_33\nis more general and describes the differential of the determinant at an arbitrary square matrix, in terms of the trace and the adjugate of the matrix.\nFrom this (or from the connection between the trace and the eigenvalues), one can derive a relation between the trace function, the matrix exponential function, and the determinant:formula_34\nA related characterization of the trace applies to linear vector fields. Given a matrix A, define a vector field F on R\"n\" by F(x) = Ax. The components of this vector field are linear functions (given by the rows of A). Its divergence div F is a constant function, whose value is equal to tr(A).\nBy the divergence theorem, one can interpret this in terms of flows: if F(x) represents the velocity of a fluid at location x and U is a region in R\"n\", the net flow of the fluid out of U is given by tr(A) \u00b7 vol(\"U\"), where vol(\"U\") is the volume of U.\nThe trace is a linear operator, hence it commutes with the derivative:\nformula_35\nTrace of a linear operator.\nIn general, given some linear map \"f\" : \"V\" \u2192 \"V\" of finite rank (where V is a vector space), we can define the trace of this map by considering the trace of a matrix representation of f, that is, choosing a basis for V and describing f as a matrix relative to this basis, and taking the trace of this square matrix. The result will not depend on the basis chosen, since different bases will give rise to similar matrices, allowing for the possibility of a basis-independent definition for the trace of a linear map.\nSuch a definition can be given using the canonical isomorphism between the space of linear endomorphisms of V of finite rank and \"V\" \u2297 \"V\"*, where \"V\"* is the dual space of V. Let v be in V and let g be in \"V\"*. Then the trace of the decomposable element \"v\" \u2297 \"g\" is defined to be \"g\"(\"v\"); the trace of a general element is defined by linearity. The trace of a linear map \"f\" : \"V\" \u2192 \"V\" of finite rank can then be defined as the trace, in the above sense, of the element of \"V\" \u2297 \"V\"* corresponding to \"f\" under the above-mentioned canonical isomorphism. Using an explicit basis for V and the corresponding dual basis for \"V\"*, one can show that this gives the same definition of the trace as given above.\nNumerical algorithms.\nStochastic estimator.\nThe trace can be estimated unbiasedly by \"Hutchinson's trick\":Given any matrix formula_36, and any random formula_37 with formula_38, we have formula_39. \nFor a proof expand the expectation directly. \nUsually, the random vector is sampled from formula_40 (normal distribution) or formula_41 (Rademacher distribution).\nMore sophisticated stochastic estimators of trace have been developed.\nApplications.\nIf a 2 x 2 real matrix has zero trace, its square is a diagonal matrix.\nThe trace of a 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 complex matrix is used to classify M\u00f6bius transformations. First, the matrix is normalized to make its determinant equal to one. Then, if the square of the trace is 4, the corresponding transformation is \"parabolic\". If the square is in the interval [0,4), it is \"elliptic\". Finally, if the square is greater than 4, the transformation is \"loxodromic\". See classification of M\u00f6bius transformations.\nThe trace is used to define characters of group representations. Two representations A, B : \"G\" \u2192 \"GL\"(\"V\") of a group G are equivalent (up to change of basis on V) if tr(A(\"g\")) = tr(B(\"g\")) for all \"g\" \u2208 \"G\".\nThe trace also plays a central role in the distribution of quadratic forms.\nLie algebra.\nThe trace is a map of Lie algebras formula_42 from the Lie algebra formula_43 of linear operators on an n-dimensional space (\"n\" \u00d7 \"n\" matrices with entries in formula_44) to the Lie algebra K of scalars; as K is Abelian (the Lie bracket vanishes), the fact that this is a map of Lie algebras is exactly the statement that the trace of a bracket vanishes:\nformula_45\nThe kernel of this map, a matrix whose trace is zero, is often said to be &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;traceless or &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;trace free, and these matrices form the simple Lie algebra formula_46, which is the Lie algebra of the special linear group of matrices with determinant 1. The special linear group consists of the matrices which do not change volume, while the special linear Lie algebra is the matrices which do not alter volume of \"infinitesimal\" sets.\nIn fact, there is an internal direct sum decomposition formula_47 of operators/matrices into traceless operators/matrices and scalars operators/matrices. The projection map onto scalar operators can be expressed in terms of the trace, concretely as:\nformula_48\nFormally, one can compose the trace (the counit map) with the unit map formula_49 of \"inclusion of scalars\" to obtain a map formula_50 mapping onto scalars, and multiplying by n. Dividing by n makes this a projection, yielding the formula above.\nIn terms of short exact sequences, one has\nformula_51\nwhich is analogous to\nformula_52\n(where formula_53) for Lie groups. However, the trace splits naturally (via formula_54 times scalars) so formula_55, but the splitting of the determinant would be as the nth root times scalars, and this does not in general define a function, so the determinant does not split and the general linear group does not decompose:\nformula_56\nBilinear forms.\nThe bilinear form (where X, Y are square matrices)\nformula_57\n where formula_58\n and for orientation, if formula_59\n then formula_60\nformula_61 is called the Killing form; it is used to classify Lie algebras.\nThe trace defines a bilinear form:\nformula_62\nThe form is symmetric, non-degenerate and associative in the sense that:\nformula_63\nFor a complex simple Lie algebra (such as formula_64\"n\"), every such bilinear form is proportional to each other; in particular, to the Killing form.\nTwo matrices X and Y are said to be \"trace orthogonal\" if\nformula_65\nThere is a generalization to a general representation formula_66 of a Lie algebra formula_67, such that formula_68 is a homomorphism of Lie algebras formula_69 The trace form formula_70 on formula_71 is defined as above. The bilinear form\nformula_72\nis symmetric and invariant due to cyclicity.\nGeneralizations.\nThe concept of trace of a matrix is generalized to the trace class of compact operators on Hilbert spaces, and the analog of the Frobenius norm is called the Hilbert\u2013Schmidt norm.\nIf formula_44 is a trace-class operator, then for any orthonormal basis formula_74, the trace is given by\nformula_75\nand is finite and independent of the orthonormal basis.\nThe partial trace is another generalization of the trace that is operator-valued. The trace of a linear operator formula_76 which lives on a product space formula_77 is equal to the partial traces over formula_28 and formula_79:\nformula_80\nFor more properties and a generalization of the partial trace, see traced monoidal categories.\nIf formula_28 is a general associative algebra over a field formula_82, then a trace on formula_28 is often defined to be any functional formula_84 which vanishes on commutators; formula_85 for all formula_86. Such a trace is not uniquely defined; it can always at least be modified by multiplication by a nonzero scalar.\nA supertrace is the generalization of a trace to the setting of superalgebras.\nThe operation of tensor contraction generalizes the trace to arbitrary tensors.\nGomme and Klein (2011) define a matrix trace operator formula_87 that operates on block matrices and use it to compute second-order perturbation solutions to dynamic economic models without the need for tensor notation.\nTraces in the language of tensor products.\nGiven a vector space V, there is a natural bilinear map \"V\" \u00d7 \"V\"\u2217 \u2192 \"F\" given by sending (\"v\", \u03c6) to the scalar \u03c6(\"v\"). The universal property of the tensor product \"V\" \u2297 \"V\"\u2217 automatically implies that this bilinear map is induced by a linear functional on \"V\" \u2297 \"V\"\u2217.\nSimilarly, there is a natural bilinear map \"V\" \u00d7 \"V\"\u2217 \u2192 Hom(\"V\", \"V\") given by sending (\"v\", \u03c6) to the linear map \"w\" \u21a6 \u03c6(\"w\")\"v\". The universal property of the tensor product, just as used previously, says that this bilinear map is induced by a linear map \"V\" \u2297 \"V\"\u2217 \u2192 Hom(\"V\", \"V\"). If V is finite-dimensional, then this linear map is a linear isomorphism. This fundamental fact is a straightforward consequence of the existence of a (finite) basis of V, and can also be phrased as saying that any linear map \"V\" \u2192 \"V\" can be written as the sum of (finitely many) rank-one linear maps. Composing the inverse of the isomorphism with the linear functional obtained above results in a linear functional on Hom(\"V\", \"V\"). This linear functional is exactly the same as the trace.\nUsing the definition of trace as the sum of diagonal elements, the matrix formula tr(AB) \n tr(BA) is straightforward to prove, and was given above. In the present perspective, one is considering linear maps S and T, and viewing them as sums of rank-one maps, so that there are linear functionals \"\u03c6\"\"i\" and \"\u03c8\"\"j\" and nonzero vectors \"v\"\"i\" and \"w\"\"j\" such that \"S\"(u) \n \u03a3\"\u03c6\"\"i\"(\"u\")\"v\"\"i\" and \"T\"(u) \n \u03a3\"\u03c8\"\"j\"(\"u\")\"w\"\"j\" for any u in V. Then\nformula_88\nfor any u in V. The rank-one linear map \"u\" \u21a6 \"\u03c8\"\"j\"(\"u\")\"\u03c6\"\"i\"(\"w\"\"j\")\"v\"\"i\" has trace \"\u03c8\"\"j\"(\"v\"\"i\")\"\u03c6\"\"i\"(\"w\"\"j\") and so\nformula_89\nFollowing the same procedure with S and T reversed, one finds exactly the same formula, proving that tr(\"S\" \u2218 \"T\") equals tr(\"T\" \u2218 \"S\").\nThe above proof can be regarded as being based upon tensor products, given that the fundamental identity of End(\"V\") with \"V\" \u2297 \"V\"\u2217 is equivalent to the expressibility of any linear map as the sum of rank-one linear maps. As such, the proof may be written in the notation of tensor products. Then one may consider the multilinear map \"V\" \u00d7 \"V\"\u2217 \u00d7 \"V\" \u00d7 \"V\"\u2217 \u2192 \"V\" \u2297 \"V\"\u2217 given by sending (\"v\", \"\u03c6\", \"w\", \"\u03c8\") to \"\u03c6\"(\"w\")\"v\" \u2297 \"\u03c8\". Further composition with the trace map then results in \"\u03c6\"(\"w\")\"\u03c8\"(\"v\"), and this is unchanged if one were to have started with (\"w\", \"\u03c8\", \"v\", \"\u03c6\") instead. One may also consider the bilinear map End(\"V\") \u00d7 End(\"V\") \u2192 End(\"V\") given by sending (\"f\", \"g\") to the composition \"f\" \u2218 \"g\", which is then induced by a linear map End(\"V\") \u2297 End(\"V\") \u2192 End(\"V\"). It can be seen that this coincides with the linear map \"V\" \u2297 \"V\"\u2217 \u2297 \"V\" \u2297 \"V\"\u2217 \u2192 \"V\" \u2297 \"V\"\u2217. The established symmetry upon composition with the trace map then establishes the equality of the two traces.\nFor any finite dimensional vector space V, there is a natural linear map \"F\" \u2192 \"V\" \u2297 \"V\"'; in the language of linear maps, it assigns to a scalar c the linear map \"c\"\u22c5id\"V\". Sometimes this is called \"coevaluation map\", and the trace \"V\" \u2297 \"V\"' \u2192 \"F\" is called \"evaluation map\". These structures can be axiomatized to define categorical traces in the abstract setting of category theory.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "43271", "revid": "51059952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43271", "title": "William IV", "text": "King of the United Kingdom from 1830 to 1837\nWilliam IV (William Henry; 21 August 1765\u00a0\u2013 20 June 1837) was King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and King of Hanover from 26 June 1830 until his death in 1837. The third son of George\u00a0III, William succeeded his elder brother George\u00a0IV, becoming the last king and penultimate monarch of the United Kingdom's House of Hanover.\nWilliam served in the Royal Navy in his youth, spending time in British North America and the Caribbean, and was later nicknamed the \"Sailor King\". In 1789, he was created Duke of Clarence and St Andrews. Between 1791 and 1811, he cohabited with the actress Dorothea Jordan, with whom he had ten children. In 1818, he married Princess Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen. In 1827, he was appointed Britain's Lord High Admiral, the first since 1709. \nAs his two elder brothers died without leaving legitimate issue, William inherited the throne when he was 64 years old. His reign saw several reforms: the Poor Law was updated, child labour restricted, slavery abolished in nearly all of the British Empire, and the electoral system refashioned by the Reform Act 1832. Although William did not engage in politics as much as his brother or his father, he was the last British monarch to appoint a prime minister contrary to the will of Parliament. He granted his German kingdom a short-lived liberal constitution. William had no surviving legitimate children at the time of his death, so he was succeeded by his niece Victoria in the United Kingdom and his brother Ernest Augustus in Hanover, ending the 123-year personal union between the two countries.\nEarly life.\nWilliam was born in the early hours of the morning on 21 August 1765 at Buckingham House, the third child and son of King George\u00a0III and Queen Charlotte. He had two elder brothers, George, Prince of Wales, and Prince Frederick (later Duke of York and Albany), and was not expected to inherit the Crown. He was baptised in the Great Council Chamber of St James's Palace on 20 September 1765. His godparents were the King's siblings: Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh; Prince Henry (later Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn); and Princess Augusta, Hereditary Duchess of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel.\nWilliam spent most of his early life in Richmond and at Kew Palace, where he was educated by private tutors. At the age of thirteen, he joined the Royal Navy as a midshipman, in Admiral Robert Digby's squadron. For four years the lieutenant of his watch was Richard Goodwin Keats, with whom he formed a life-long friendship and whom he described as the one to whom he owed all his professional knowledge. He was present at the Battle of Cape St Vincent in 1780, when the \"San Juli\u00e1n\" struck her colours to his ship. His experiences in the navy seem to have been little different from those of other midshipmen, though in contrast to other sailors he was accompanied on board ship by a tutor. He did his share of the cooking and got arrested with his shipmates after a drunken brawl in Gibraltar; he was hastily released from custody after his identity became known.\nWilliam served in New York during the American War of Independence, making him the only member of the British royal family to visit America up to and through the American Revolution. While William was in America, George Washington approved a plot to kidnap him, writing:\nThe spirit of enterprise so conspicuous in your plan for surprising in their quarters and bringing off the Prince William Henry and Admiral Digby merits applause; and you have my authority to make the attempt in any manner, and at such a time, as your judgment may direct. I am fully persuaded, that it is unnecessary to caution you against offering insult or indignity to the persons of the Prince or Admiral...\nThe plot did not come to fruition; the British heard of it and assigned guards to William, who had until then walked around New York unescorted. In September 1781, William held court at the Manhattan home of Governor James Robertson. In attendance were Mayor David Mathews, Admiral Digby, and General Oliver De Lancey.\nWilliam became a lieutenant in 1785 and captain of the following year, during which he spent time in the colonies of Newfoundland and Nova Scotia. Later in 1786, he was stationed in the West Indies under Horatio Nelson, who wrote of William, \"in his professional line, he is superior to two-thirds, I am sure, of the [naval] list; and in attention to orders, and respect to his superior officer, I hardly know his equal.\" The two were great friends, and dined together almost nightly. At Nelson's wedding, William insisted on giving the bride away. After touring Quebec in 1787, he was, the next year, given command of the frigate and promoted to rear-admiral while commanding in 1790.\nWilliam sought to be made a duke like his elder brothers, and to receive a similar parliamentary grant, but his father was reluctant. To put pressure on him, William threatened to stand for the House of Commons for the constituency of Totnes in Devon. Appalled at the prospect of his son making his case to the voters, the King created him Duke of Clarence and St Andrews and Earl of Munster on 19 May 1789, supposedly saying: \"I well know it is another vote added to the Opposition.\" William's political record was inconsistent and, like many politicians of the time, cannot be ascribed to a single party. However, he allied himself publicly with the Whigs, as did his elder brothers, who were known to be in conflict with the political positions of their father.\nNaval career.\nWilliam ceased his active service in the Royal Navy in 1790. When Britain declared war on France in 1793, he was eager to serve his country and expected to be given a command but was not, perhaps at first because he had broken his arm by falling down some stairs drunk, but later perhaps because he gave a speech in the House of Lords opposing the war. The following year he spoke in favour of the war, and expected a command after his change of heart; none came. The Admiralty did not reply to his request. He did not lose hope of being appointed to an active post. In 1798 he was made an admiral, but the rank was purely nominal. Despite repeated petitions, he was never given a command throughout the Napoleonic Wars. In 1811, he was appointed to the honorary position of Admiral of the Fleet. In 1813, he came nearest to involvement in actual fighting, when he visited the British troops fighting in the Low Countries. Watching the bombardment of Antwerp from a church steeple, he came under fire, and a bullet pierced his coat.\nInstead of serving at sea, William spent time in the House of Lords, where he spoke in opposition to the abolition of slavery, which still existed in the British colonies. Freedom would do the slaves little good, he argued. He had travelled widely and, in his eyes, the living standard among freemen in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland was worse than that among slaves in the West Indies. His experience in the Caribbean, where he \"quickly absorbed the plantation owners' views about slavery\", lent weight to his position, which was perceived as well-argued and just by some of his contemporaries. In his first speech before Parliament he called himself \"an attentive observer of the state of the negroes\" who found them well cared for and \"in a state of humble happiness\". Others thought it \"shocking that so young a man, under no bias of interest, should be earnest in continuance of the slave trade\". In his speech to the House, William insulted William Wilberforce, the leading abolitionist, saying: \"the proponents of the abolition are either fanatics or hypocrites, and in one of those classes I rank Mr. Wilberforce\". On other issues he was more liberal, such as supporting moves to abolish penal laws against dissenting Christians. He also opposed efforts to bar those found guilty of adultery from remarriage.\nRelationships and marriage.\nWilliam had an illegitimate son before 1791 whose mother is unknown; the son, also called William, likely drowned off Madagascar when HMS \"Blenheim\" sank or foundered in February 1807. Caroline von Linsingen, whose father was a general in the Hanoverian infantry, claimed to have had a son, Heinrich, by William in around 1790 but William was not in Hanover at the time that she claims, and the story is considered implausible by historians.\nFrom 1791, William lived with an Irish actress, Dorothea Bland, better known by her stage name Mrs Jordan, the title \"Mrs\" being assumed at the start of her stage career to explain an inconvenient pregnancy and \"Jordan\" because she had \"crossed the water\" from Ireland to Britain. He appeared to enjoy the domesticity of his life with Mrs. Jordan, remarking to a friend: \"Mrs Jordan is a very good creature, very domestic and careful of her children. To be sure she is absurd sometimes and has her humours. But there are such things more or less in all families.\" The couple, while living quietly, enjoyed entertaining, with Mrs. Jordan writing in late 1809: \"We shall have a full and merry house this Christmas, 'tis what the dear Duke delights in.\" The King was accepting of his son's relationship with the actress (though recommending that he halve her allowance); in 1797, he created William the Ranger of Bushy Park, which included a large residence, Bushy House, for William's growing family. William used Bushy as his principal residence until he became king. His London residence, Clarence House, was constructed to the designs of John Nash between 1825 and 1827.\nWilliam and Jordan had ten illegitimate children\u2014five sons and five daughters\u2014nine of whom were named after William's siblings; each was given the surname \"FitzClarence\". Their affair lasted for twenty years before ending in 1811. Mrs Jordan had no doubt about the reason for the break-up: \"Money, money, my good friend, has, I am convinced made HIM at this moment the most wretched of men\", adding, \"With all his excellent qualities, his domestic \"virtues\", his love for his \"lovely\" children, what must he not at this moment suffer?\" She was given a financial settlement of \u00a34,400 () per year and custody of her daughters on condition that she did not resume the stage. When she resumed acting in an effort to repay debts incurred by the husband of one of her daughters from a previous relationship, William took custody of the daughters and stopped paying the \u00a31,500 () designated for their maintenance. After Mrs Jordan's acting career began to fail, she fled to France to escape her creditors and died, impoverished, near Paris in 1816.\nDeeply in debt, William attempted to marry wealthy heiresses Catherine Tylney-Long and Sophia Wykeham, but his suits were unsuccessful. Following the death of William's niece Princess Charlotte of Wales, then second-in-line to the British throne, in 1817, George\u00a0III was left with twelve children but no legitimate grandchildren. The race was on among his sons, the royal dukes, to marry and produce an heir. William had great advantages in this race\u2014his two older brothers were both childless and estranged from their wives, who were both beyond childbearing age anyway, and William was the healthiest of the three. If he lived long enough, he would almost certainly ascend the British and Hanoverian thrones and have the opportunity to sire the next monarch. William's initial choices of potential wives either met with the disapproval of his eldest brother, the Prince of Wales, or turned him down. His younger brother Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge, was sent to Germany to scout out the available Protestant princesses; he came up with Princess Augusta of Hesse-Kassel, but her father, Frederick, declined the match. Two months later Adolphus married Augusta himself. Eventually, however, a princess was found who was amiable, home-loving and willing to accept (even enthusiastically welcome) William's nine surviving children, several of whom had not yet reached adulthood. In the Drawing Room at Kew Palace on 11 July 1818, William married Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen.\nWilliam's marriage, which lasted almost twenty years until his death, was a happy one. Adelaide took both William and his finances in hand. For their first year of marriage the couple lived in economical fashion in Germany. William's debts were soon on the way to being paid, especially since Parliament had voted him an increased allowance, which he reluctantly accepted after his requests to have it increased further were refused. William is not known to have had mistresses after his marriage. The couple had two short-lived daughters and Adelaide suffered two miscarriages. Despite this, false rumours that she was pregnant persisted into William's reign\u2014he dismissed them as \"damned stuff\".\nLord High Admiral.\nWilliam's eldest brother, the Prince of Wales, had been Prince Regent since 1811 because of the mental illness of their father. In 1820, George\u00a0III died and the Prince Regent became George\u00a0IV. William was now second in the line of succession, preceded only by his brother Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany. Reformed since his marriage, William walked for hours, ate relatively frugally, and the only drink he imbibed in quantity was barley water flavoured with lemon. Both of his older brothers were unhealthy, and it was considered only a matter of time before he became king. When Frederick died in 1827, William, then more than 60 years old, became heir presumptive. Later that year, the incoming prime minister, George Canning, appointed him to the office of Lord High Admiral, which had been in commission (that is, exercised by a board rather than by a single individual) since 1709. While in office, William had repeated conflicts with his Council, which was composed of Admiralty officers. Things finally came to a head in 1828 when, as Lord High Admiral, he put to sea with a squadron of ships, leaving no word of where they were going, and remained away for ten days. The King requested his resignation through the prime minister, Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington; he complied.\nDespite the difficulties William experienced, he did considerable good as Lord High Admiral. He abolished the cat o' nine tails for most offences other than mutiny, attempted to improve the standard of naval gunnery, and required regular reports of the condition and preparedness of each ship. He commissioned the first steam warship and advocated the construction of more. Holding the office permitted him to make mistakes and learn from them\u2014a process that might have been far more costly if he had not learnt before becoming king that he should act only with the advice of his councillors.\nWilliam spent much of his remaining time during his brother's reign in the House of Lords. He supported the Catholic Emancipation Bill against the opposition of his younger brother Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, describing the latter's position on the Bill as \"infamous\", to Ernest's outrage. George\u00a0IV's health was increasingly bad; it was obvious by early 1830 that he was near death. The King took his leave of William at the end of May, stating, \"God's will be done. I have injured no man. It will all rest on you then.\" William's genuine affection for his older brother could not mask his rising anticipation that he would soon be king.\nReign.\nEarly reign.\nWhen George IV died on 26 June 1830 without surviving legitimate issue, William succeeded him as William\u00a0IV. Aged 64, he was the oldest person at that point to assume the British throne, a distinction he would hold until surpassed by Charles III in 2022.\nUnlike his extravagant brother, William was unassuming, discouraging pomp and ceremony. In contrast to George\u00a0IV, who tended to spend most of his time in Windsor Castle, William was known, especially early in his reign, to walk, unaccompanied, through London or Brighton. Until the Reform Crisis eroded his standing he was very popular among the people, who saw him as more approachable and down-to-earth than his brother.\nThe King immediately proved himself a conscientious worker. The prime minister, the Duke of Wellington, stated that he had done more business with King William in ten minutes than he had with George\u00a0IV in as many days. Lord Brougham described him as an excellent man of business, asking enough questions to help him understand the matter\u2014whereas George\u00a0IV feared to ask questions lest he display his ignorance and George\u00a0III would ask too many and then not wait for a response.\nThe King did his best to endear himself to the people. Charlotte Williams-Wynn wrote shortly after his accession: \"Hitherto the King has been indefatigable in his efforts to make himself popular, and do good natured and amiable things in every possible instance.\" Emily Eden noted: \"He is an immense improvement on the last unforgiving animal, who died growling sulkily in his den at Windsor. This man at least \"wishes\" to make everybody happy, and everything he has done has been benevolent.\"\nWilliam dismissed his brother's French chefs and German band, replacing them with English ones to public approval. He gave much of George\u00a0IV's art collection to the National Gallery and halved the royal stud. George had begun an extensive (and expensive) renovation of Buckingham Palace; William refused to reside there and twice tried to give the palace away, once to the Army as a barracks and once to Parliament after the Houses of Parliament burned down in 1834. His informality could be startling: when in residence at the Royal Pavilion in Brighton, he used to send to the hotels for a list of their guests and invite anyone he knew to dinner, urging guests not to \"bother about clothes. The Queen does nothing but embroider flowers after dinner.\"\nUpon taking the throne, William did not forget his nine surviving illegitimate children, creating his eldest son, George, Earl of Munster and granting the other children the precedence of a daughter or a younger son of a marquess. Despite this his children importuned for greater opportunities, disgusting elements of the press who reported that the \"impudence and rapacity of the FitzJordans is unexampled\". The relationship between William and his sons \"was punctuated by a series of savage and, for the King at least, painful quarrels\" over money and honours. His daughters, on the other hand, proved an ornament to his court, as \"They are all, you know, pretty and lively, and make society in a way that real princesses could not.\"\nReform crisis.\nAt the time, the death of the monarch caused fresh Parliamentary elections and, in the general election of 1830, Wellington's Tories lost ground to the Whigs under Lord Grey, though the Tories still had the largest number of seats. With the Tories bitterly divided, Wellington was defeated in the House of Commons in November, and Lord Grey formed a government. Grey pledged to reform the electoral system, which had seen few changes since the fifteenth century. The inequities in the system were great; for example, large towns such as Manchester and Birmingham elected no members (though they were part of county constituencies), while small boroughs, known as rotten or pocket boroughs\u2014such as Old Sarum with just seven voters\u2014elected two members of Parliament each. Often, the rotten boroughs were controlled by great aristocrats, whose nominees were invariably elected by the constituents\u2014who were, most often, their tenants\u2014especially since the secret ballot was not yet used in Parliamentary elections. Landowners who controlled seats were even able to sell them to prospective candidates.\nWhen the First Reform Bill was defeated in the House of Commons in 1831, Grey's ministry urged William to dissolve Parliament, which would lead to a new general election. At first, William hesitated to exercise his prerogative powers to dissolve Parliament because elections had just been held the year before and the country was in a state of high excitement which might boil over into violence. He was, however, irritated by the conduct of the Opposition, which announced its intention to move the passage of an Address, or resolution, in the House of Lords, against dissolution. Regarding the Opposition's motion as an attack on his prerogative, and at the urgent request of Lord Grey and his ministers, the King prepared to go in person to the House of Lords and prorogue Parliament. The monarch's arrival would stop all debate and prevent passage of the Address. When initially told that his horses could not be ready at such short notice, William is supposed to have said, \"Then I will go in a hackney cab!\" Coach and horses were assembled quickly and he immediately proceeded to Parliament. Said \"The Times\" of the scene before William's arrival, \"It is utterly impossible to describe the scene\u00a0... The violent tones and gestures of noble Lords\u00a0... astonished the spectators, and affected the ladies who were present with visible alarm.\" Lord Londonderry brandished a whip, threatening to thrash the Government supporters, and was held back by four of his colleagues. William hastily put on the crown, entered the Chamber, and dissolved Parliament. This forced new elections for the House of Commons, which yielded a great victory for the reformers. But although the Commons was clearly in favour of parliamentary reform, the Lords remained implacably opposed to it.\nThe crisis saw a brief interlude for the celebration of the King's coronation on 8 September 1831. At first, William wished to dispense with the coronation entirely, feeling that his wearing the crown while proroguing Parliament answered any need. He was persuaded otherwise by traditionalists. He refused, however, to celebrate the coronation in the expensive way his brother had\u2014the 1821 coronation had cost \u00a3240,000, of which \u00a316,000 was merely to hire the jewels. At William's instructions, the Privy Council budgeted less than \u00a330,000 for the coronation. When traditionalist Tories threatened to boycott what they called the \"Half Crown-nation\", the King retorted that they should go ahead, and that he anticipated \"greater convenience of room and less heat\".\nAfter the rejection of the Second Reform Bill by the House of Lords in October 1831, agitation for reform grew across the country; demonstrations grew violent in so-called \"Reform Riots\". In the face of popular excitement, the Grey ministry refused to accept defeat, and re-introduced the Bill, despite the continued opposition of peers in the House of Lords. Frustrated by the Lords' obdurate attitude, Grey suggested that the King create a sufficient number of new peers to ensure the passage of the Reform Bill. The King objected\u2014though he had the power to create an unlimited number of peers, he had already created 22 new peers in his Coronation Honours. William reluctantly agreed to the creation of the number of peers sufficient \"to secure the success of the bill\". However, the King, citing the difficulties with a permanent expansion of the peerage, told Grey that the creations must be restricted as much as possible to the eldest sons and collateral heirs of existing peers, so that the created peerages would for the most part be absorbed as subsidiary titles. This time, the Lords did not reject the bill outright, but began preparing to change its basic character through amendments. Grey and his fellow ministers decided to resign if the King did not agree to an immediate and large creation to force the bill through in its entirety. The King refused, and accepted their resignations. The King attempted to restore the Duke of Wellington to office, but Wellington had insufficient support to form a ministry and the King's popularity sank to an all-time low. Mud was slung at his carriage and he was publicly hissed. The King agreed to reappoint Grey's ministry, and to create new peers if the House of Lords continued to pose difficulties. Concerned by the threat of the creations, most of the bill's opponents abstained and the Reform Act 1832 was passed. The mob blamed William's actions on the influence of his wife and brother, and his popularity recovered.\nForeign policy.\nWilliam distrusted foreigners, particularly anyone French, which he acknowledged as a \"prejudice\". He also felt strongly that Britain should not interfere in the internal affairs of other states, which brought him into conflict with the interventionist foreign secretary, Lord Palmerston. William supported Belgian independence and, after unacceptable Dutch and French candidates were put forward, favoured Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the widower of his niece Charlotte, as a candidate for the newly created Belgian throne.\nThough he had a reputation for tactlessness and buffoonery, William could be shrewd and diplomatic. He foresaw that the potential construction of a canal at Suez would make good relations with Egypt vital to Britain. Later in his reign, he flattered the American ambassador at a dinner by announcing that he regretted not being \"born a free, independent American, so much did he respect that nation, which had given birth to George Washington, the greatest man that ever lived\". By exercising his personal charm, William assisted in the repair of Anglo-American relations, which had been so deeply damaged during the reign of his father.\nKing of Hanover.\nPublic perception in Germany was that Britain dictated Hanoverian policy. This was not the case. In 1832, Austrian chancellor Klemens von Metternich introduced laws that curbed fledgling liberal movements in Germany. Lord Palmerston opposed this, and sought William's influence to cause the Hanoverian government to take the same position. The Hanoverian government instead agreed with Metternich, much to Palmerston's dismay, and William declined to intervene. The conflict between William and Palmerston over Hanover was renewed the following year when Metternich called a conference of the German states, to be held in Vienna, and Palmerston wanted Hanover to decline the invitation. Instead, William's brother Prince Adolphus, Viceroy of Hanover, accepted, backed fully by William. In 1833, William signed a new constitution for Hanover, which empowered the middle class, gave limited power to the lower classes, and expanded the role of the parliament. The constitution would later be revoked by his brother and successor in Hanover, King Ernest Augustus.\nLater reign and death.\nFor the remainder of his reign, William interfered actively in politics only once, in 1834, when he became the last British sovereign to choose a prime minister contrary to the will of Parliament. In 1834, the ministry was facing increasing unpopularity and Lord Grey retired; the home secretary, William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne, replaced him. Melbourne retained most Cabinet members, and his ministry retained an overwhelming majority in the House of Commons. Some members of the Government, however, were anathema to the King, and increasingly left-wing policies concerned him. The previous year Grey had already pushed through legislation reforming the Protestant Church of Ireland. The Church collected tithes throughout Ireland, supported multiple bishoprics and was wealthy. However, barely an eighth of the Irish population belonged to the Church of Ireland. In some parishes, there were no Church of Ireland members at all, but there was still a priest paid for by tithes collected from the local Catholics and Presbyterians, leading to charges that idle priests were living in luxury at the expense of Irish people living at the level of subsistence. Grey's Act had reduced the number of bishoprics by half, abolished some of the sinecures and overhauled the tithe system. Further measures to appropriate the surplus revenues of the Church of Ireland were mooted by the more radical members of the Government, including Lord John Russell. The King had an especial dislike for Russell, calling him \"a dangerous little Radical.\"\nIn November 1834, the leader of the House of Commons and chancellor of the Exchequer, Lord Althorp, inherited a peerage, thus removing him from the Commons to the Lords. Melbourne had to appoint a new Commons leader and a new Chancellor (who by long custom, must be drawn from the Commons), but the only candidate whom Melbourne felt suitable to replace Althorp as Commons leader was Lord John Russell, whom William (and many others) found unacceptable due to his radical politics. William claimed that the ministry had been weakened beyond repair and used the removal of Lord Althorp\u2014who had previously indicated that he would retire from politics upon becoming a peer\u2014as the pretext for the dismissal of the entire ministry. With Lord Melbourne gone, William chose to entrust power to a Tory, Sir Robert Peel. Since Peel was then in Italy, the Duke of Wellington was provisionally appointed prime minister. When Peel returned and assumed leadership of the ministry for himself, he saw the impossibility of governing because of the Whig majority in the House of Commons. Consequently, Parliament was dissolved to force fresh elections. Although the Tories won more seats than in the previous election, they were still in the minority. Peel remained in office for a few months but resigned after a series of parliamentary defeats. Melbourne was reappointed as prime minister, remaining there for the rest of William's reign, and the King was forced to accept Russell as Commons leader.\nThe King had a mixed relationship with Lord Melbourne. Melbourne's government mooted more ideas to introduce greater democracy, such as the devolution of powers to the Legislative Council of Lower Canada, which greatly alarmed the King, who feared it would eventually lead to the loss of the colony. At first, the King bitterly opposed these proposals. William exclaimed to Lord Gosford, Governor General-designate of Canada: \"Mind what you are about in Canada\u00a0... mind me, my Lord, the Cabinet is not my Cabinet; they had better take care or by God, I will have them impeached.\" When William's son Augustus enquired of his father whether the King would be entertaining during Ascot week, William gloomily replied, \"I cannot give any dinners without inviting the ministers, and I would rather see the devil than any one of them in my house.\" Nevertheless, William approved the Cabinet's recommendations for reform. Despite his disagreements with Melbourne, the King wrote warmly to congratulate the prime minister when he triumphed in the adultery case brought against him concerning Caroline Norton\u2014he had refused to permit Melbourne to resign when the case was first brought. The King and Lord Melbourne eventually found a \"modus vivendi\", with Melbourne applying tact and firmness when called for and William realising that his prime minister was far less radical in his politics than the King had feared.\nBoth the King and Queen were fond of their niece, Princess Alexandrina Victoria of Kent. Their attempts to forge a close relationship with the girl were frustrated by the conflict between the King and Victoria's widowed mother, the Duchess of Kent and Strathearn. The King, angered at what he took to be disrespect from the Duchess to his wife, took the opportunity at what proved to be his final birthday banquet in August 1836 to settle the score. Speaking to those assembled at the banquet, who included the Duchess and Princess Victoria, William expressed his hope that he would survive until Victoria was 18 so that the Duchess would never be regent. He said, \"I trust to God that my life may be spared for nine months longer\u00a0... I should then have the satisfaction of leaving the exercise of the Royal authority to the personal authority of that young lady, heiress presumptive to the Crown, and not in the hands of a person now near me, who is surrounded by evil advisers and is herself incompetent to act with propriety in the situation in which she would be placed.\" The speech was so shocking that Victoria burst into tears, while her mother sat in silence and was only with difficulty persuaded not to leave immediately after dinner (the two left the next day). William's outburst undoubtedly contributed to Victoria's tempered view of him as \"a good old man, though eccentric and singular\". William survived, though mortally ill, to the month after Victoria's coming of age. \"Poor old man!\", Victoria wrote as he was dying, \"I feel sorry for him; he was always personally kind to me.\"\nWilliam was \"very much shaken and affected\" by the death of his eldest daughter, Sophia, Lady de L'Isle and Dudley, in childbirth in April 1837. William and his eldest son, the Earl of Munster, were estranged at the time, but William hoped that a letter of condolence from Munster signalled a reconciliation. His hopes were not fulfilled and Munster, still thinking he had not been given sufficient money or patronage, remained bitter to the end.\nQueen Adelaide attended the dying William devotedly, not going to bed herself for more than ten days. William died at 2:12am on 20 June 1837 at Windsor Castle. He was buried in the Royal Vault at St George's Chapel on 8 July.\nLegacy.\nAs William had no living legitimate issue, the British throne passed to his niece Victoria, the only legitimate child of Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, George\u00a0III's fourth son. Under Salic Law, a woman could not rule Hanover and so the Hanoverian throne went to George\u00a0III's fifth son, Ernest Augustus. William's death thus ended the personal union of Britain and Hanover, which had persisted since 1714. The main beneficiaries of his will were his eight surviving children by Mrs Jordan. Although William is not the direct ancestor of the later monarchs of the United Kingdom, he has many notable descendants through his illegitimate children with Mrs Jordan, including British prime minister David Cameron, TV presenter Adam Hart-Davis, and author and statesman Duff Cooper.\nWilliam IV had a short but eventful reign. In Britain, the Reform Crisis marked the ascendancy of the House of Commons and the corresponding decline of the House of Lords, and the King's unsuccessful attempt to remove the Melbourne ministry indicated a reduction in the political influence of the Crown and of the King's influence over the electorate. During the reign of George\u00a0III, the king could have dismissed one ministry, appointed another, dissolved Parliament, and expected the electorate to vote in favour of the new administration. Such was the result of a dissolution in 1784, after the dismissal of the Fox-North Coalition, and in 1807, after the dismissal of Lord Grenville. But when William dismissed the Melbourne ministry, the Tories under Peel failed to win the ensuing elections. The monarch's ability to influence the opinion of the electorate, and therefore national policy, had been reduced. None of William's successors has attempted to remove a government or to appoint another against the wishes of Parliament. William understood that as a constitutional monarch he had no power to act against the opinion of Parliament. He said, \"I have my view of things, and I tell them to my ministers. If they do not adopt them, I cannot help it. I have done my duty.\"\nDuring William's reign, the British Parliament enacted major reforms, including the Factory Act 1833 (preventing child labour), the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 (emancipating slaves in the colonies), and the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 (standardising provision for the destitute). William attracted criticism both from reformers, who felt that reform did not go far enough, and from reactionaries, who felt that reform went too far. A modern interpretation sees him as failing to satisfy either political extreme by trying to find a compromise between two bitterly opposed factions, but in the process proving himself more capable as a constitutional monarch than many had supposed.\nHonours and arms.\nBritish and Hanoverian honours\nForeign honours\nArms.\nBefore becoming king, William, as a son of the sovereign, was granted the use of the royal arms (without the electoral inescutcheon in the Hanoverian quarter) in 1781, differenced by a label of three points argent, the centre point bearing a cross gules, the outer points each bearing an anchor azure. In 1801 his arms altered with the royal arms, however the marks of difference remained the same.\nAs king, William used the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom undifferenced: Quarterly, I and IV Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or (for England); II Or a lion rampant within a tressure flory-counter-flory Gules (for Scotland); III Azure a harp Or stringed Argent (for Ireland); overall an escutcheon tierced per pale and per chevron (for Hanover), I Gules two lions passant guardant Or (for Brunswick), II Or a semy of hearts Gules a lion rampant Azure (for L\u00fcneburg), III Gules a horse courant Argent (for Westphalia), overall an inescutcheon Gules charged with the crown of Charlemagne Or, the whole escutcheon surmounted by a crown.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "43274", "revid": "1316523163", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43274", "title": "Knight Rider (1982 TV series)", "text": "American crime drama television series (1982\u20131986)\nKnight Rider is an American action crime drama television series created and produced by Glen A. Larson. The series was originally broadcast on NBC from September 26, 1982, to April 4, 1986. The show stars David Hasselhoff as Michael Knight, a sleek and modern crime fighter assisted by KITT, an advanced, artificially intelligent, self-aware, and nearly indestructible car. This was the last series Larson devised at Universal Television before he moved to 20th Century Fox Television. While the series received negative reviews from critics during its initial run, retrospective reviews have been more positive from audiences and critics alike. The series has received a cult following. \nPlot.\nSelf-made billionaire Wilton Knight rescues police Detective Lieutenant Michael Arthur Long after a near-fatal gunshot to the face, giving him a new face through plastic surgery and a new identity and name: Michael Knight. Wilton selects Michael to be the primary field agent in the pilot program of his public justice organization, the Foundation for Law and Government (FLAG). The other half of this pilot program is the Knight Industries Two Thousand (KITT), a heavily modified, technologically advanced Pontiac Firebird Trans Am with numerous features, including a highly durable shell and frame, controlled by a computer with artificial intelligence. Michael and KITT are brought in during situations where \"direct action might provide the only feasible solution\".\nHeading FLAG is Devon Miles, who takes over after Wilton's death and provides Michael with directives and guidance. Dr. Bonnie Barstow (season 1, 3 and 4) and April Curtis (season 2) are the chief engineers in charge of KITT's care and act as a technical assistant to Devon.\n Hasselhoff also played Garthe Knight, Wilton Knight's estranged son and a criminal mastermind who drives Goliath, a Peterbilt 352 Pacemaker semi-truck armed with rockets, and protected by KITT's Molecular Bonded Shell.\nProduction.\nVehicle.\nThe car used as KITT in the series was a customized 1982 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am, that cost US$100,000 to build (). The nose and dashboard of the car were designed by design consultant Michael Scheffe.\nStuntman Jack Gill says KITT's ride height was dropped 1.5 inches (4\u00a0cm) from a stock Trans Am. The hero car was the only vehicle that contained the intricate dashboard. Spare cars were always on hand, and Universal eventually did all of the modifications that were needed. A mock up dashboard was used on a sound stage for closeups of the voice box or other buttons.\nGlen Larson wanted the talking muscle car to have a heartbeat and asked Scheffe to design a beam of light like the Cylons had in \"Battlestar Galactica\" to be used on the front of the vehicle. The Pontiac's nose was eventually extended slightly.\nGill said that the studio got the cars from Pontiac for $1 apiece, but Pontiac often gave the studio vehicles that had already been damaged from a train derailment. The only car Universal had to pay for was the hero car.\nFor the scenes in which KITT appeared to be driving without a driver, Gill would sit behind the driver's seat. Gill would extend his arms and legs through the seat out of sight. A two-way mirror was created that hid Gill during scenes where KITT appeared to be driving solo. KITT was never seen driving for long periods of time solo because of the difficulty of shooting it.\nWilliam Daniels, the voice of KITT, would record his lines after the majority of the episode was filmed. Hasselhoff would work with an assistant off-camera who would read him KITT's lines. If KITT was in motion during filming, the lines would be read to Hasselhoff through the car stereo. The vehicle was usually towed during scenes when Hasselhoff appeared to be driving.\nThe studio held a marketing campaign for \"Knight Rider\". Fans could write to the network and they would receive a pamphlet detailing some features about KITT. The first campaign was held in August 1982. The pamphlet said, \"The Competition is NO Competition!\" KITT was pictured parked alongside a vehicle that resembled the General Lee from \"The Dukes of Hazzard\".\nSoundtrack.\nThe \"Knight Rider Theme\" was composed by Stu Phillips and Glen A. Larson. The series DVD bonus material contains an interview about this lead music, where Glen A. Larson says he remembers a theme out of a classical piece (\"Marche Et Cort\u00e8ge De Bacchus\" Act III \u2013 No. 14 from \"Sylvia\" written by French composer L\u00e9o Delibes) from which he took pieces for the \"Knight Rider Theme\". The decision to use synthesizers was largely a network decision. Larson claims that they used five or six synthesizers, drums and a Fender bass.\nThe rest of the series music was composed by Stu Phillips for 13 episodes and Don Peake for 75 episodes. Glen A. Larson co-wrote music for one episode and Morton Stevens wrote the music for one episode. Peake took over scoring duties with the 14th episode of season 1, \"Hearts of Stone\", in 1983, when Larson moved to Twentieth Century-Fox and Phillips was working there on his projects. Peake remained as the series sole composer until the end of the series in 1986.\nIn 2005, FSM released a disc of music from the series, featuring the series theme, ad bumpers and Phillips' scores for \"Knight of the Phoenix\" (the pilot), \"Not a Drop to Drink\", \"Trust Doesn't Rust\", \"Forget Me Not\" and the composer's final episode \"Inside Out\", as well as the logo music for Glen Larson Productions. Albums of Don Peake's scores have also been issued.\nEpisodes.\nThe intro throughout most of the episodes began with this narration: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Knight Rider, a shadowy flight into the dangerous world of a man who does not exist. \nMichael Knight, a young loner on a crusade to champion the cause of the innocent, the helpless, the powerless in a world of criminals who operate above the law.\nDuring the first season, the outro was Michael and KITT driving on a road in the desert with Wilton Knight's words of \"One man can make a difference, Michael.\" These words were phased out after episode 7, \"Not A Drop To Drink\".\nThen the narration goes on to say: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Michael Knight, a lone crusader in a dangerous world. The world of the Knight Rider.\nThe outro of seasons 2 and 3 was Michael and KITT driving away from the sunset toward the camera. Season 4's outro was the same, except with KITT in Super Pursuit Mode.\nCritical reception.\nAt review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the first season scores 35%, based mainly on archived contemporaneous reviews, with an average rating of 5.60/10. The site's consensus reads: \"This car can do anything -- except paper over how tiresomely silly \"Knight Rider\"'s concept is.\" Tom Shales, writing for \"The Washington Post\", commented: \"'Knight Rider' is all revved up but has no place to go, except, maybe, headlong into a large brick wall.\" In contrast, retrospective reviews have been more positive. Marc Bernardin of \"Entertainment Weekly\" called the show \"a relic from a simpler time, when audiences demanded less from their TV\".\nSyndication and home media.\nIn syndication.\n\"Knight Rider\" was first syndicated in the U.S. in fall 1986.

{"id": "43277", "revid": "4637213", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43277", "title": "Abalone (board game)", "text": "1987 board game\nAbalone is a two-player abstract strategy board game designed by Michel Lalet and Laurent L\u00e9vi in 1987. Players are represented by opposing black and white marbles on a hexagonal board with the objective of pushing six of the opponent's marbles off the edge of the board.\n\"Abalone\" was published in 1990 and has sold more than 4.5\u00a0million units. The year it was published it received one of the first Mensa Select awards. As of 2011, it is sold in more than thirty countries.\nGameplay.\nRules.\nThe board consists of 61 circular spaces arranged in a hexagon, five on a side. Each player has 14 marbles that rest in the spaces and are initially arranged as shown below, on the left image. The players take turns with the black marbles moving first. For each move, a player moves a straight line of one, two or three marbles of one color by one space in one of six directions. The move can be either \"broadside / arrow-like\" (parallel to the line of marbles) or \"in-line / in a line\" (serial in respect to the line of marbles), as illustrated below.\nA player can push their opponent's marbles (a \"sumito\") that are in a line to their own with an in-line move only. They can only push if the pushing line has more marbles than the pushed line (three can push one or two; two can push one). Marbles must be pushed to an empty space (i.e. not blocked by a marble) or off the board. The winner is the first player to push six of the opponent's marbles off the edge of the board.\nMove notation.\nThe notation for recording moves assigns the letters A-I to the horizontal lines, and the numbers 1\u20139 to northwest\u2013southeast diagonals.\n I O O O O O\n H O O O O O O\n G + + O O O + +\n F + + + + + + + +\n E + + + + + + + + +\n D + + + + + + + + 9\n C + + @ @ @ + + 8\n B @ @ @ @ @ @ 7\n A @ @ @ @ @ 6\n 1 2 3 4 5\nOne popular notation:\nan inline move can be denoted by the movement of the trailing marble (the \"caboose\");\nbroadside moves can be denoted by the initial positions of the two extremities of the \"lance\" followed by the final position of the first marble (with this notation, each broadside move has two notations possible, which could be avoided).\nAvoiding draws.\nThe dynamics of the basic game may have one serious flaw: it seems that a good but conservative player can set up their marbles in a defensive wedge and ward off all attacks indefinitely. An attacker may try to outflank this wedge or lure it into traps, but such advances are often more dangerous to the attacker than the defender. Thus, from the starting position, it takes little skill and no imagination to avoid losing, and nothing in the rules prevents games from being interminable.\nBecause it is boring for games to be drawn out indefinitely, serious \"Abalone\" players tacitly agree to play aggressively. A player who forms a defensive wedge and makes no attempt to attack is likely to be a novice who might lose anyway. Nevertheless, there remains the possibility of any competent player bringing the game to a standstill and successfully avoiding losing, even to a championship-level player.\nThere are several possible \"solutions\". First, in tournaments, a judge may penalize a player for playing defensively. This solution is somewhat unsatisfactory, given that a judge may not always be present, and that \"defensive play\" is subjective.\nSecond, several variations of the rules have been developed for the same board and marbles. None of the variations has the same appealing simplicity of the original.\nThe third, and perhaps best, alternative starting positions have been designed to make the formation of stalemate wedges less likely. Experiments are still underway to find an opening position which neither devolves to a draw nor gives too great an advantage to the first player. One popular attempt are the \"Marguerite\" or Daisy positions, two versions of which are displayed in the center and to the right.\nAnother option is to create a \"turn limit\" where if no marble has been knocked off the board by turn 15, whoever has made the most progress towards the center line wins. This encourages an aggressive strategy of moving forward, and often the rule will not come into play.\nRule variations and more players.\n\"Abalone\" can be played by three or more people using the same board with fewer marbles for each player and each player using a different color.\nA number of two-player variations use a third color for passive pieces. For example, the variation called \"The Pillar\" (with a fixed marble in the centre of the board), which has been examined in some depth by Alex Borello and Nicolas Le Gal, uses a third color. Another possible variation involves either player winning the game by ejecting the central marble.\nA few variations use a second layer of marbles.\nStrategy.\nForums of \"Abalone\" communities have found that, generally:\nChampions.\nPerson-to-person competitions have been held by the Mind Sports Olympiad since 1997.\nGert Schnider and Thomas Fenner participated in the evaluation and adjustment of AbaPro. Marc Tastet was the 1992 World Othello Champion, Stephane Nicolet is a two-time World Othello Championship finalist, and Jan Stastna is a strong Othello player.\nIn a computer-to-computer competition held in 2003 at the International Computer Games Association (ICGA) events in Graz, Austria, the AbaPro program defeated the Nacre program.\nIn 1999, a number of top players from the Mind Sports Olympiad signed an agreement to use a different starting position (the Belgian daisy) to revitalize the game. This has been used for top tournaments since then, including the AbaCup.\nReception.\nIn the February\u2013March 1990 edition of \"Games International\" (Issue 13), Mike Siggins called the components \"of good quality\", and the rules \"extremely concise.\" He found the game very replayable, and commented that \"it has the potential to become a classic.\" His only complaint was that \"as players become more proficient the game can slow up and stalemates often result.\" Despite this, Siggins gave the game an above-average rating of 8 out of 10, saying, \"\"Abalone\" is one of the best abstract games to appear in a long while.\"\nPlay online.\nSeveral digital adaptions of Abalone are available:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Marriage to D\u00f3nal an Chogaidh (Donal \"of the war\") \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh brought her greater wealth and influence, reportedly owning as much as 1,000 head of cattle and horses. In 1593, when her sons Tibbot Bourke and Murchadh \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh (Murrough O'Flaherty) and her half-brother D\u00f3nal an Ph\u00edopa (\"Donal of the Pipes\") were taken captive by the English governor of Connacht, Sir Richard Bingham, O'Malley sailed to England to petition for their release. She formally presented her request to Queen Elizabeth I at her court in Greenwich Palace.\nO'Malley is not mentioned in the Irish annals, so documentary evidence for her life comes mostly from English sources, especially the eighteen \"Articles of Interrogatory\", questions put to her in writing on behalf of Elizabeth I. She is mentioned in the English State Papers and in other documents of the kind.\nIn Irish folklore she is commonly known as Gr\u00e1inne Mhaol (anglicised as Granuaile) and is a well-known historical figure in sixteenth-century Irish history. Her name was also rendered in contemporaneous English documents in various ways, including Gr\u00e1inne O'Maly, Graney O'Mally, Granny ni Maille, Grany O'Mally, Grayn Ny Mayle, Grane ne Male, Grainy O'Maly, and Granee O'Maillie, rarely as Grace O'Malley. In popular culture, she is often referred to as \"The Pirate Queen\".\nEarly life.\nO'Malley was born in Ireland around 1530, when Henry VIII was King of England and held the title Lord of Ireland. Under the policies of the English government at the time, the semi-autonomous Irish clans were left mostly to their own devices. However, this changed over the course of O'Malley's life as the Tudor conquest of Ireland gathered pace.\nEoghan Dubhdara \u00d3 M\u00e1ille, her father, and his family were based in Clew Bay, County Mayo. He was Chief of the Name of Clan \u00d3 M\u00e1ille and Lord of Umhaill, and claimed descent from Maille mac Conall. The U\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille were one of the seafaring clans of Connacht, and they had built a row of castles facing the sea to protect their territory. They controlled most of what is now the barony of Murrisk in south-west County Mayo and recognised as their nominal overlords the Mac William \u00cdochtar branch of the Bourkes, who controlled much of what is now County Mayo. The Bourke family (Irish: d\"e B\u00farca\") were originally Anglo-Norman (de Burgh) but by O'Malley's lifetime had become completely Gaelicised. Her mother, Margaret or Maeve, was also an O'Malley. Although she was the only child of Dubhdara and his wife, O'Malley had a paternal half-brother called D\u00f3nal na P\u00edopa. Although under Brehon Law only male members of the derbhfine could inherit the mantle of Chief of the Name through tanistry, O'Malley \"was considered to be the legal retainer of the family land and seafaring activities\".\nWith shore castles like Carrickkildavnet, the Clan U\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille demanded and received black rent from those who fished off their coasts, which included fishermen from as far away as England. The head of the family was known simply by his surname as \u00d3 M\u00e1ille (anglicised as The O'Malley). The local oral tradition has it that O'Malley, as a young girl, wished to go on a trading expedition to Spain with her father. Upon being told she could not because her long hair would catch in the ship's ropes, she cut off most of her hair to shame her father into taking her. This earned her the nickname \"Gr\u00e1inne Mhaol\" (; from \"maol\", meaning 'bald' or 'having cropped hair'), usually anglicised as Granuaile ( ). The nickname may also come from \"Gr\u00e1inne Umhaill\" (\"Gr\u00e1inne of Umhall\", Umhall being a historical district of west Connacht dominated by the U\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille).\nAs a child she most likely lived at her family's residence of Belclare and Clare Island, but she may have been fostered by another family, as fosterage was traditional among the Gaelic nobility of Ireland.\nMarriage to \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh.\nO'Malley was married in 1546 to D\u00f3nal an Chogaidh \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh, \"t\u00e1naiste\" or heir to the Chief of the Name of Clan \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh, which would have been a good political match for the daughter of the Chief of Clan \u00d3 M\u00e1ille. As \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh \"t\u00e1naiste\", D\u00f3nal an Chogaidh had expectations of one day ruling as Lord of Iar Connacht, which was roughly equivalent to modern Connemara.\nShe bore three children during her marriage to D\u00f3nal an Chogaidh:\nIn 1564, D\u00f3nal's ambitions were dashed when his kinsman Murrough na dTuadh \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh was appointed by Queen Elizabeth as Chief of the Name instead of him. In 1565, D\u00f3nal was killed in an ambush while hunting in the hills surrounding Lough Corrib. His assassination was, undoubtedly, part of D\u00f3nal's wider struggle against Clan Joyce for control of Hen's Castle upon the lough. When the Joyces moved to take the Castle, thinking that Gr\u00e1inne would not resist, she fought back successfully and forced Clan Joyce to retreat. O'Malley then returned to her own lands and established her principal residence upon Clare Island (now called Granuaile's Castle). She allegedly took a shipwrecked sailor as her lover. The affair lasted only briefly as he was killed by Clan MacMahon of Ballyvoy. Seeking vengeance, O'Malley attacked Clan MacMahon's stronghold of Doona Castle in Blacksod Bay and slew her lover's murderers upon Caher Island. Her veangence against Clan MacMahon earned Gr\u00e1inne the nickname the 'Dark Lady of Doona'.\nMarriage to Bourke.\nBy 1566, O'Malley had married a second time, this time to Risde\u00e1rd an Iarainn (\"Iron Richard\") Bourke, 18th Mac William \u00cdochtar (d.1583), his nickname deriving from his ironworks at Burrishoole, the place of his principal castle and residence. Tibbot, 1st Viscount Mayo, was a child of this marriage.\nStill not satisfied with her revenge, O'Malley then sailed for Ballycroy and attacked the garrison at Doona Castle, overpowering the defenders and taking the castle for herself. Her attack against the MacMahons was not the first time she interrupted someone at their prayers. Legend tells of another lord who stole property from her and fled to a church for sanctuary. She was determined to wait out the thief, maintaining that he could starve or surrender. The thief dug a tunnel and escaped, however, and the hermit who took care of the church broke his vow of silence to scold her for attempting to harm someone who had sought sanctuary. Her reply is not recorded.\nMore than twenty years after her death, an English Lord Deputy of Ireland recalled her ability as a leader of fighting men, noting the fame she still had among the Irish people.\nAutonomous status.\nIn 1576, O'Malley engaged in the surrender and regrant process with the Lord Deputy Sir Henry Sidney in respect of her lands. Because Rockfleet was over a week's march from Dublin, and as she was so often at sea, control by the Crown was very weak.\nIn 1593, in his letter to protest O'Malley's claims against him, Sir Richard Bingham claimed that she was \"nurse to all rebellions in the province for this forty years\". Bingham was Lord President of Connacht, tasked with controlling local lords who had, until then, been mostly autonomous.\nO'Malley had every reason, and used every opportunity, to limit the power of the Kingdom of Ireland over her part of the country. An expedition from Galway led by Sheriff William \u00d3ge Martyn attacked her castle at Clare Island in March 1579. However, they were put to flight and barely escaped.\nMeeting with Elizabeth.\nIn the late 16th century, English power steadily grew in Ireland and O'Malley's power was steadily encroached upon. In June 1593, O'Malley sent a petition to the Queen. She asked her \"to grant her some reasonable maintenance for the little tyme she hath to live\". In return she offered \"a surrender at her hands\" of the lands of her two sons and those of her two surviving Bourke nephews. She asked for \"free libertye during her lyve to envade with sword and fire all your highness enemyes wheresoever they are or shall be\u00a0... without any interruption of any person or persons whatsoever\". In May 1593, Hugh Maguire (Lord of Fermanagh) rebelled and burned Ballymote, then under the control of Sir George Bingham. One of Maguire's men was captured and implicated Grace's son Tibbott-ne-Long in a wider Tyrone- inspired conspiracy against the English. Tibbott was promptly captured by Sir Richard Bingham, sent to Athlone prison and charged with treason. Grace's half-brother D\u00f3nal na P\u00edopa was also arrested by Sir Richard Bingham and charged with the murder of some English soldiers. Grace sailed to England to petition Queen Elizabeth I for their release. She was accompanied by Sir-Murrough-ne-Doe O'Flaherty.\nSir Richard Bingham implied that Grace sailed her own ship to England as he stated she brought over the son of Ulick Bourke of Erris and her grandnephew, the son of Tibbott Reagh Bourke who \"attended uppon Grany O'Maille in her late beyinge at court\". The Earl of Ormond, cousin and favourite of the Queen, gave Grace an introduction to Lord Burghley, chief advisor to the Queen. Burghley sent O'Malley a list of questions, \"eighteen articles of interrogatory\" which were answered and returned.\nAt around the same time, Sir Richard Bingham wrote to Burghley: \"There be 2 notable traitors gon over Sir Morrow ne doe and Grainy O\u2019Maly both rebelle from their childhoode and continually in accion\u00a0... for notwithstanding that they have many pardons there ys matter ynough of late found out against them to hang them by justice\".\nTradition but not the written sources states that O'Malley met with the Queen at Greenwich Palace, wearing a fine gown; the two of them were surrounded by guards and the members of Elizabeth's royal court.\nMany of what Anne Chambers refers to as \"fanciful tales\" have embellished the story of the meeting in Irish story-telling tradition. For example, O'Malley is said to have refused to bow before Elizabeth because she did not recognise her as the \"Queen of Ireland\". It was said that she had a dagger concealed about her person, which guards found upon searching her. Elizabeth's courtiers were said to be very upset and worried, but O'Malley informed the Queen that she carried it for her own safety. Elizabeth accepted this and seemed untroubled. It was said that O'Malley had sneezed and was given a lace-edged handkerchief from a noblewoman. She apparently blew her nose into it and then threw the cloth into a nearby fireplace, much to the shock of the court. O'Malley informed everyone that in Ireland, a used handkerchief was considered dirty and was properly destroyed.\nThe Queen ordered her Privy Council to seek an explanation from Sir Richard Bingham regarding his treatment of O'Malley and her family and to investigate how her situation could best be relieved. Bingham defended himself replying \"in defence of my own innocency\u00a0... to shew me instance of any one that ever I used violence against, havinge always (I thancke the Lord) had that consideracion of christian duty as I never sought any man's bloode otherwise then by course of her Maties. comon lawes to take away.\" He made his thoughts clear that \"how great soevr any may make her wch knoweth her not I will nevr aske but a boat of xxx tonnes to beate her\u00a0... and wth gods assistance dryve her and all her fleet into the sea.\"\nTowards the end of September 1593 the Queen wrote to Bingham ordering the release of Tibbott-ne-Long and D\u00f3nal-ne-P\u00edopa from prison. She also ordered for provision to be made for Grace out of her sons' estates, the amount to be deducted from their crown taxes. She requested Bingham to allow them ownership of their lands and property and \"protect them to live in peace to enjoy their livelihoods\". The Queen stated that O'Malley had \"departeth with great thankfulness and with many more earnest promises that she will, as long as she lives, continue a dutiful subject, yea and will employ all her power to offend and prosecute any offender against Us\".\nThe leading authority on the life of Grace O'Malley, Anne Chambers, states that the conversation between the two women would have been in English as all the indications are that O'Malley could speak it, and not in Latin as often said.\nLast years.\nSir Richard Bingham disagreed with the decision of the Queen and initially did not obey her instructions, which O'Malley had personally delivered to him on her return to Ireland.\nO'Malley had to threaten him \"that she would else repaire againe into England\" if he did not comply. Therefore, he reluctantly agreed, \"to enlarge Grany O'Mally, her son Tibbott and her brother Donal na Pippe,\u00a0... upon such slender surytes.\"\nGrace O'Malley rebuilt her fleet with three large galleys and began to return to her former life. Bingham struck, quartering a troop of his soldiers on her ships to accompany her in her voyages and later forcing her into service against some of her own kinsmen who he claimed were in rebellion. Bingham quartered another detachment of his soldiers on Grace O'Malley's property in Burishoole, leading to her impoverishment. Unable to bear the strain, she, her sons cousins and followers \"were forced to withdrawe themselves into the Province of Mounster, where they do remaine in great distresse\". In April 1595 O'Malley sought the aid of the Earl of Ormond at his Elizabethan manor at Carrick-on-Suir. Ormond wrote to Burghley on her behalf. At some time between 17 April and 5 May she returned to England to plead her case with Burghley. O'Malley was rewarded when in August 1595, a commission was granted by the queen and the Privy Council to investigate the lands in Mayo claimed by her two sons, her grandson D\u00f3nal O'Flaherty, son of Owen, Dermot and D\u00f3nal O'Malley of \"Owel O'Maillie\", and Miles MacEvilly, Tibbott-ne-Long's foster-father, \"with the intention of the Queen accepting their surrenders of the premises and re-granting them by letters patent.\"\nAs the Nine Years' War escalated, O'Malley sought to retrench her position with the crown. On 18 April 1595 she petitioned Lord Burghley, complaining of the activities of troops and asking to hold her estate for Elizabeth I. She added that \"her sons, cousins, and followers will serve with a hundred men at their own charges at sea upon the coast of Ireland in Her Majesty's wars upon all occasions\u00a0... to continue dutiful unto Her Majesty, as true and faithful subjects\". Throughout the war she encouraged and supported her son Tibbot Bourke to fight for the Crown against Tyrone's confederation of Irish lords.\nIn September 1595, there was a conspiracy against Sir Richard Bingham; he fled to England and was imprisoned. Sir Conyers Clifford was appointed Governor of Connaught.\nShe most likely died at Rockfleet Castle around 1603, the same year as Elizabeth's death, though the year and place of O'Malley's death are disputed. Her family's usual burial place was in Clare Island Abbey.\nBiographical sources.\nIn her 2006 biography of O'Malley, Irish historian and novelist Anne Chambers described her as:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;a fearless leader, by land and by sea, a political pragmatist and politician, a ruthless plunderer, a mercenary, a rebel, a shrewd and able negotiator, the protective matriarch of her family and tribe, a genuine inheritor of the Mother Goddess and Warrior Queen attributes of her remote ancestors. Above all else, she emerges as a woman who broke the mould and thereby played a unique role in history.\nDocumentary evidence for O'Malley's life comes mostly from English sources, as she is not mentioned in the Irish annals. The \u00d3 M\u00e1ille family \"book\", a collection of eulogistic bardic poetry and other material of the sort kept by aristocratic Gaelic households of the period, has not survived. There are no contemporary images of her. An important source of information is the eighteen \"Articles of Interrogatory\", questions put to her in writing on behalf of Elizabeth I. She is also mentioned in the English State Papers and in other documents of the kind, an example being a letter sent by the Lord Deputy, Sir Henry Sidney, to his son Phillip in 1577: \"There came to mee a most famous femynyne sea captain called Grace Imallye, and offred her service unto me, wheresoever I woulde command her, with three gallyes and two hundred fightinge men\u00a0...\"\nLocal traditions concerning her were collected by Irish scholar John O'Donovan in the 1830s and 1840s on behalf of the Ordnance Survey of Ireland. In a letter of 1838, he describes her as being \"most vividly remembered by tradition and people were living in the last generation who conversed with people who knew her personally\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Charles Cormick of Erris, now 74 years and six weeks old, saw and conversed with Elizabeth O'Donnell of Newtown within the Mullet, who died about 65 years ago who had seen and intimately known a Mr Walsh who remembered O'Malley. Walsh died at the age of 107 and his father was the same age as O'Malley.\nA story is recorded of O'Malley chiding her son T\u00edobo\u00edd in the course of an attack on Kanturk Castle, when she thought he was shirking the battle: (\"Are you trying to hide in my arse, the place that you came out of?\"). She is also recorded as saying, with regard to her followers, (that she would rather have a shipload of Conroys and MacAnallys than a shipload of gold).\nWestport House.\nWestport House in County Mayo, Ireland, was the seat of the Browne dynasty, Marquesses of Sligo, direct descendants of Grace O'Malley. The current house was built close to the site of Cahernamart ( \u2013 \"fort of the beef market\"), an \u00d3 M\u00e1ille fort. The original house was built by Colonel John Browne, a Jacobite, who was at the Siege of Limerick (1691), and his wife Maude Bourke. Maude Bourke was O'Malley's great-great-granddaughter.\nA statue of Grace O'Malley by the artist Michael Cooper \u2013 the brother-in-law of the 11th Marquess of Sligo \u2013 is on display in Westport House, and a bronze casting of the statue is situated on the grounds near the house. Westport House also contains an exhibition on the life of O'Malley compiled by the author Anne Chambers, who wrote a biography of Granuaile.\nCultural impact.\nO'Malley's life has inspired many musicians, novelists, and playwrights to create works based on her life and adventures and she has been used as a personification of Ireland:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was formed to trade in the Indian Ocean region, initially with the East Indies (which included the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia), and later with East Asia. The company gained control of large parts of the Indian subcontinent and Hong Kong. At its peak, the company was the largest corporation in the world by various measures and had its own armed forces in the form of the company's three presidency armies, totalling about 260,000 soldiers, twice the size of the British Army at certain times.\nOriginally chartered as the \"Governor and Company of Merchants of London Trading into the East-Indies,\" the company rose to account for half of the world's trade during the mid-1700s and early 1800s, particularly in basic commodities including cotton, silk, indigo dye, sugar, salt, spices, saltpetre, tea, gemstones, and later opium. The company also initiated the beginnings of the British Raj in the Indian subcontinent.\nThe company eventually came to rule large areas of the Indian subcontinent, exercising military power and assuming administrative functions. Company-ruled areas in the region gradually expanded after the Battle of Plassey in 1757 and by 1858 most of modern India, Pakistan and Bangladesh was either ruled by the company or princely states closely tied to the company by treaties. Following the Sepoy Rebellion of 1857, the Government of India Act 1858 led to the British Crown assuming direct control of present-day Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Myanmar in the form of the new British Indian Empire.\nThe company subsequently experienced recurring problems with its finances, despite frequent government intervention. The company was dissolved in 1874 under the terms of the East India Stock Dividend Redemption Act enacted one year earlier, as the Government of India Act had by then rendered it vestigial, powerless, and obsolete. The official government machinery of the British Empire had assumed its governmental functions and absorbed its armies.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nIn 1577, Francis Drake set out on an expedition from England to plunder Spanish settlements in South America in search of gold and silver. Sailing in the \"Golden Hind\" he achieved this, and then sailed across the Pacific Ocean in 1579, known then only to the Spanish and Portuguese. Drake eventually sailed into the East Indies and came across the Moluccas, also known as the Spice Islands, and met Sultan Babullah. In exchange for linen, gold, and silver, the English obtained a large haul of exotic spices, including cloves and nutmeg. Drake returned to England in 1580 and became a hero; his circumnavigation raised an enormous amount of money for England's coffers, and investors received a return of some 5,000 percent. Thus started an important element in the eastern design during the late sixteenth century.\nSoon after the Spanish Armada's defeat in 1588, the captured Spanish and Portuguese ships and cargoes enabled English voyagers to travel the globe in search of riches. London merchants presented a petition to Elizabeth I for permission to sail to the Indian Ocean. The aim was to deliver a decisive blow to the Spanish and Portuguese monopoly of far-eastern trade. Elizabeth granted her permission and in 1591, James Lancaster in the with two other ships, financed by the Levant Company, sailed from England around the Cape of Good Hope to the Arabian Sea, becoming the first English expedition to reach India that way. Having sailed around Cape Comorin to the Malay Peninsula, they preyed on Spanish and Portuguese ships there before returning to England in 1594.\nThe biggest prize that galvanised English trade was the seizure of a large Portuguese carrack, the \"Madre de Deus\", by Walter Raleigh and the Earl of Cumberland at the Battle of Flores on 13 August 1592. When she was brought in to Dartmouth she was the largest vessel ever seen in England and she carried chests of jewels, pearls, gold, silver coins, ambergris, cloth, tapestries, pepper, cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, benjamin (a highly aromatic balsamic resin used for perfumes and medicines), red dye, cochineal and ebony. Equally valuable was the ship's rutter (mariner's handbook) containing vital information on the China, India, and Japan trade routes.\nIn 1596, three more English ships sailed east but all were lost at sea. A year later however saw the arrival of Ralph Fitch, an adventurer merchant who, with his companions, had made a remarkable nine year overland journey to Mesopotamia, the Persian Gulf, the Indian Ocean, India and Southeast Asia. Fitch was consulted on Indian affairs and gave even more valuable information to Lancaster.\nFormation.\nIn 1599, a group of prominent merchants and explorers met to discuss a potential East Indies venture under a royal charter. Besides Fitch the group included Stephen Soame, then Lord Mayor of London; Thomas Smythe, a powerful London politician and administrator; Richard Hakluyt, writer and proponent of English colonisation of the Americas; and several other sea-farers who had served with Drake and Raleigh.\nOn 22 September, the group stated their intention \"to venture in the pretended voyage to the East Indies (the which it may please the Lord to prosper)\" and to themselves invest \u00a330,133 (over \u00a34,000,000 in today's money). Two days later, the \"Adventurers\" reconvened and resolved to apply to the Queen for support of the project. Although their first attempt had not been completely successful, they sought the Queen's unofficial approval to continue. They bought ships for the venture and increased their investment to \u00a368,373.\nThey convened again a year later, on 31 December 1600, and this time they succeeded; the Queen responded favourably to a petition by George, Earl of Cumberland and 218 others, including James Lancaster, Sir John Harte, Sir John Spencer (both of whom had been Lord Mayor of London), the adventurer Edward Michelborne, the nobleman William Cavendish and other aldermen and citizens. She granted her charter to their corporation named Governor and Company of Merchants of London trading into the East Indies. For a period of fifteen years, the charter awarded the company a monopoly on English trade with all countries east of the Cape of Good Hope and west of the Straits of Magellan. Any traders there without a licence from the company were liable to forfeiture of their ships and cargo (half of which would go to the Crown and half to the company), as well as imprisonment at the \"royal pleasure\".\nThe charter named Thomas Smythe as the first governor of the company, and 24 directors (including James Lancaster) or \"committees\", who made up a Court of Directors. They, in turn, reported to a Court of Proprietors, who appointed them. Ten committees reported to the Court of Directors. By tradition, business was initially transacted at the Nags Head Inn, opposite St Botolph's church in Bishopsgate, before moving to East India House on Leadenhall Street.\nEarly voyages to the East Indies.\nSir James Lancaster commanded the first East India Company voyage in 1601 aboard . The following year, whilst sailing in the Malacca Straits, Lancaster took the rich 1,200 ton Portuguese carrack \"Sao Thome\" carrying pepper and spices. The booty enabled the voyagers to set up two \"factories\" (trading posts) \u2013 one at Bantam on Java and another in the Moluccas (Spice Islands) before leaving. On return to England in 1603, they learned of Elizabeth's death, but Lancaster was knighted by the new king, James I, on account of the voyage's success. By this time, the war with Spain had ended but the company had profitably breached the Spanish-Portuguese duopoly; new horizons opened for the English.\nIn March 1604, Sir Henry Middleton commanded the company's second voyage. General William Keeling, a captain during the second voyage, led the third voyage aboard \"Red Dragon\" from 1607 to 1610 along with \"Hector\" under Captain William Hawkins and \"Consent\" under Captain David Middleton.\nEarly in 1608, Alexander Sharpeigh was made captain of the company's \"Ascension\", and general or commander of the fourth voyage. Thereafter two ships, \"Ascension\" and \"Union\" (captained by Richard Rowles), sailed from Woolwich on 14 March 1608. This expedition was lost.\nInitially, the company struggled in the spice trade because of competition from the Dutch East India Company. This rivalry led to military skirmishes, with each company establishing fortified trading posts, fleets, and alliances with local rulers. The Dutch, better financed and supported by their government, gained the upper hand by establishing a stronghold in the spice islands (now Indonesia), enforcing a near-monopoly through aggressive policies that eventually drove the EIC to seek trade opportunities in India instead. The English company opened a factory (trading post) in Bantam on Java on its first voyage, and imports of pepper from Java remained an important part of the company's trade for twenty years.\nEnglish traders frequently fought their Dutch and Portuguese counterparts in the Indian Ocean. The company achieved a major victory over the Portuguese in the Battle of Swally in 1612, at Suvali in Surat. The company decided to explore the feasibility of a foothold in mainland India, with official sanction from both Britain and the Mughal Empire, and requested that the Crown launch a diplomatic mission.\nFoothold in India.\nCompany ships docked at Surat in Gujarat in 1608. The company's first Indian factory was established in 1611 at Masulipatnam on the Andhra Coast of the Bay of Bengal, and its second in 1615 at Surat. The high profits reported by the company after landing in India initially prompted James I to grant subsidiary licences to other trading companies in England. However, in 1609, he renewed the East India Company's charter for an indefinite period, with the proviso that its privileges would be annulled if trade was unprofitable for three consecutive years.\nIn 1615, James I instructed Sir Thomas Roe to visit the Mughal Emperor Nur-ud-din Salim Jahangir (r.\u00a01605\u20131627) to arrange for a commercial treaty that would give the company exclusive rights to reside and establish factories in Surat and other areas. In return, the company offered to provide the Emperor with goods and rarities from the European market. This mission was highly successful, and Jahangir sent a letter to James through Sir Thomas Roe:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Upon which assurance of your royal love I have given my general command to all the kingdoms and ports of my dominions to receive all the merchants of the English nation as the subjects of my friend; that in what place soever they choose to live, they may have free liberty without any restraint; and at what port soever they shall arrive, that neither Portugal nor any other shall dare to molest their quiet; and in what city soever they shall have residence, I have commanded all my governors and captains to give them freedom answerable to their own desires; to sell, buy, and to transport into their country at their pleasure.\nFor confirmation of our love and friendship, I desire your Majesty to command your merchants to bring in their ships of all sorts of rarities and rich goods fit for my palace; and that you be pleased to send me your royal letters by every opportunity, that I may rejoice in your health and prosperous affairs; that our friendship may be interchanged and eternal.\u2014\u200a\nExpansion in present day South Asia.\nThe company, which benefited from the imperial patronage, soon expanded its commercial trading operations. It eclipsed the Portuguese Estado da \u00cdndia, which had established bases in Goa, Chittagong, and Bombay; Portugal later ceded Bombay to England as part of the dowry of Catherine of Braganza on her marriage to King Charles II. The East India Company also launched a joint attack with the Dutch United East India Company (VOC) on Portuguese and Spanish ships off the coast of China that helped secure EIC ports in China, independently attacking the Portuguese in the Persian Gulf Residencies primarily for political reasons. The company established trading posts in Surat (1619) and Madras (1639). By 1647, the company had 23 factories and settlements in India, and 90 employees. Many of the major factories became some of the most populated and commercially influential cities in Bengal, including the walled forts of Fort William in Bengal, Fort St George in Madras, and Bombay Castle.\nThe first century of the Company, despite its original profits coming primarily from piracy in the Spice Islands between competing European powers and their companies, saw the East India Company change focus after suffering a major setback in 1623 when their factory in Amboyna in the Moluccas was attacked by the Dutch. This compelled the company to formally abandon their efforts in the Spice Islands, and turn their attention to Bengal where, by this time, they were making steady, if less exciting, profits. After gaining the indifferent patronage of the Mughal Empire, whose cities were 'the megacities of their time' and whose wealth was unrivaled outside of Asia in the 17th century, the Company's first century in the Mughal-ruled areas was spent cultivating their relationship with the Mughal Dynasty, and conducting peaceful trade at great profit. At first it should be said the EIC was drawn into the Mughal system, acting as a kind of vassal to Mughal authority in present-day Bangladesh: it was from this position that the Company would ultimately outplay and outmanoeuvre all competing powers in the region, to eventually use that very system to hold power itself. What started as trading posts on undesirable land were developed into sprawling factory complexes with hundreds of workers sending exotic goods to England and managing protected points to export English finished goods to local merchants. The Company's initial rise in Bengal and successes generally came at the expense of competing European powers through the art of currying favours and well-placed bribes, as the Company was matched at every step with French expansion in the region (whose equivalent company carried substantial royal support). Throughout the entire century the company only resorted to force against the Mughals once, with terrible consequences. The Anglo-Mughal war (1686\u20131690) was a complete defeat, ending when the EIC effectively swore fealty to the Mughals to get their factories back.\nThe East India Company's fortunes changed for the better in 1707 when Bengal and other regions under Mughal rule fell into anarchy after the death of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. A series of large-scale rebellions, and the collapse of the Mughal taxation system led to the effective independence of virtually all of the pre-1707 Mughal fiefs and holdings, with their capital Delhi routinely under the control of Maratha, Afghan, or usurper generals' armies. The EIC was able to take advantage of this chaos, slowly assuming direct control of the province of Bengal, and fighting numerous wars against the French for control of the east coast of the subcontinent. The Company's position in the Mughal court as it fell apart made it possible to sponsor various powerful people on the subcontinent as they individually contended with others, steadily amassing more land and power in India to themselves.\nIn the 18th Century, the primary source of the Company's profits in Bengal became taxation in conquered and controlled provinces, as the factories became fortresses and administrative hubs for networks of tax collectors that expanded into enormous cities. The Mughal Empire was the richest in the world in 1700, and the East India Company tried to strip it bare for a century thereafter. Dalrymple calls it \"the single largest transfer of wealth until the Nazis.\" What was in the 17th century the production capital of the world for textiles was forced to become a market for British-made textiles. Statues, jewels, and various other valuables were moved from the palaces of Bengal to the townhouses of the English countryside. Bengal in particular suffered the worst of Company tax farming, highlighted by the Great Bengal famine of 1770.\nThe primary tool of expansion for the company was the Sepoy. The Sepoys were locally raised with European training and equipment, who changed warfare in present-day South Asia. Mounted forces and their superior mobility had been king on the region's battlefields for a thousand years, with cannon so well integrated that the Mughals fought with cannon mounted on elephants; all were no match to line infantry with decent discipline supported with field cannon. Repeatedly, a few thousand company sepoys fought vastly larger Mughal forces numerically and came out victorious. Afghan, Mughal and Maratha factions started creating their own European-style forces, often with French equipment, as the chaos intensified and the stakes were raised. Ultimately, the company won out, generally through as much diplomacy and state-craft as through fraud and deception. The gradual rise of the East India Company within the Mughal network culminated in the Second Anglo-Maratha War, in which the Company successfully ousted the Maratha, the Empire's official protectors, at the high water point in their rise to power, and installed a young Mughal Prince as Emperor, with the Company as the de jure protectors of the Empire from their position of direct control in Bengal. This relationship was repeatedly strained as the Company continued its expansion and exploitation, however it lasted in some form until 1858, when the last Mughal Emperor was exiled as the Company was disbanded and its assets were taken over by the British Crown.\nIn 1634, the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan extended his hospitality to English traders to Bengal, the richest region of the empire, and in 1717 customs duties were completely waived for the English in Bengal. By then, the Company's mainstay businesses were in cotton, silk, opium, indigo dye, saltpetre and tea. Meanwhile, the Dutch, the Company's most aggressive competitors, had expanded their monopoly of the spice trade in the Straits of Malacca by ousting the Portuguese in 1640\u20131641. With reduced Portuguese and Spanish influence in the region, the EIC and VOC entered a period of intense competition, resulting in the Anglo-Dutch wars of the 17th and 18th centuries. The British were also interested in trans-Himalayan trade routes, as they would create access to untapped markets for British manufactured goods in Tibet and China. This economic interest was showcased by the Anglo-Nepalese war (1814\u20131816).\nExpansion throughout Asia.\nWithin the first two decades of the 17th century, the Dutch East India Company or \"Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie\", (VOC) was the wealthiest commercial operation in the world with 50,000\u00a0employees worldwide and a private fleet of 200\u00a0ships. It specialised in the spice trade and gave its shareholders 40% annual dividend.\nThe British East India Company was fiercely competitive with the Dutch and French throughout the 17th and 18th centuries over spices from the Spice Islands. Some spices, at the time, could only be found on these islands, such as nutmeg and cloves; and they could bring profits as high as 400 per cent from one voyage.\nThe tension was so high between the Dutch and the British East Indies Trading Companies that it escalated into at least four Anglo-Dutch wars: 1652\u20131654, 1665\u20131667, 1672\u20131674 and 1780\u20131784.\nCompetition arose in 1635 when Charles I granted a trading licence to Sir William Courteen, which permitted the rival Courteen association to trade with the east at any location in which the EIC had no presence.\nIn an act aimed at strengthening the power of the EIC, King Charles II granted the EIC (in a series of five acts around 1670) the rights to autonomous territorial acquisitions, to mint money, to command fortresses and troops and form alliances, to make war and peace, and to exercise both civil and criminal jurisdiction over the acquired areas.\nIn 1689, a Mughal fleet commanded by Sidi Yaqub attacked Bombay. After a year of resistance the EIC surrendered in 1690, and the company sent envoys to Aurangzeb's camp to plead for a pardon. The company's envoys had to prostrate themselves before the emperor, pay a large indemnity, and promise better behaviour in the future. The emperor withdrew his troops, and the company subsequently re-established itself in Bombay and set up a new base in Calcutta.\nSlavery 1621\u20131834.\nThe East India Company's archives suggest its involvement in the slave trade began in 1684, when a Captain Robert Knox was ordered to buy and transport 250 slaves from Madagascar to St. Helena. The East India Company began using and transporting slaves in Asia and the Atlantic in the early 1620s, according to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica,&lt;ref name=\"topic/East\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; or in 1621, according to Richard Allen. Eventually, the company ended the trade in 1834 after numerous legal threats from the British state and the Royal Navy in the form of the West Africa Squadron, which discovered various ships had contained evidence of the illegal trade.\nJapan.\nIn 1613, during the rule of Tokugawa Hidetada of the Tokugawa shogunate, the British ship , under the command of Captain John Saris, was the first English ship to call on Japan. Saris was the chief factor of the EIC's trading post in Java, and with the assistance of William Adams, an English sailor who had arrived in Japan in 1600, he was able to gain permission from the ruler to establish a commercial house in Hirado on the Japanese island of Kyushu:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We give free license to the subjects of the King of Great Britaine, Sir Thomas Smythe, Governor and Company of the East Indian Merchants and Adventurers forever safely come into any of our ports of our Empire of Japan with their shippes and merchandise, without any hindrance to them or their goods, and to abide, buy, sell and barter according to their own manner with all nations, to tarry here as long as they think good, and to depart at their pleasure.\nUnable to obtain Japanese raw silk for export to China, and with their trading area reduced to Hirado and Nagasaki from 1616 onwards, the company closed its factory in 1623.\nAnglo-Mughal war.\nThe first of the Anglo-Indian wars occurred in 1686 when the company conducted naval operations against Shaista Khan, the governor of Mughal Bengal. This led to the siege of Bombay and the subsequent intervention of the Mughal Emperor, Aurangzeb. Subsequently, the English company was defeated and fined.\nMughal convoy piracy incident of 1695\nIn September 1695, Captain Henry Every, an English pirate on board the , reached the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, where he teamed up with five other pirate captains to make an attack on the Indian fleet returning from the annual pilgrimage to Mecca. The Mughal convoy included the treasure-laden \"Ganj-i-Sawai\", reported to be the greatest in the Mughal fleet and the largest ship operational in the Indian Ocean, and its escort, the \"Fateh Muhammed\". They were spotted passing the straits en route to Surat. The pirates gave chase and caught up with the \"Fateh Muhammed\" some days later, and meeting little resistance, took some \u00a340,000 of silver.\nEvery continued in pursuit and managed to overhaul \"Ganj-i-Sawai\", which resisted strongly before eventually striking. \"Ganj-i-Sawai\" carried enormous wealth and, according to contemporary East India Company sources, was carrying a relative of the Grand Mughal, though there is no evidence to suggest that it was his daughter and her retinue. The loot from the \"Ganj-i-Sawai\" had a total value between \u00a3325,000 and \u00a3600,000, including 500,000 gold and silver pieces, and has become known as the richest ship ever taken by pirates.\nWhen the news arrived in England it caused an outcry. To appease Aurangzeb, the East India Company promised to pay all financial reparations, while Parliament declared the pirates \"hostis humani generis\" (\"the enemy of humanity\"). In mid-1696 the government issued a \u00a3500 bounty on Every's head and offered a free pardon to any informer who disclosed his whereabouts. The first worldwide manhunt in recorded history was underway.\nThe plunder of Aurangzeb's treasure ship had serious consequences for the English East India Company. The furious Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb ordered Sidi Yaqub and Nawab Daud Khan to attack and close four of the company's factories in India and imprison their officers, who were almost lynched by a mob of angry Mughals, blaming them for their countryman's depredations, and threatened to put an end to all English trading in India. To appease Emperor Aurangzeb and particularly his Grand Vizier Asad Khan, Parliament exempted Every from all of the Acts of Grace (pardons) and amnesties it would subsequently issue to other pirates.\nChina.\nThe British began trading with China in 1699. This fact is recorded from the Chinese side in \"The Draft History of the Qing\" under the year Kangxi 37 (1698). The apparent discrepancy between the British and Chinese sources can be explained by the fact that Chinese New Year of 1699 did not fall until 31 January, so that any treaties entered into in January would have been logged under Kangxi 37 rather than Kangxi 38. In 1715 the Company established a permanent \"factory\" in Guangzhou (Canton).\nThe company started selling opium to Chinese merchants in the 1770s in exchange for goods like porcelain and tea, causing a series of opioid addiction outbreaks across China in 1820. The ruling Qing dynasty outlawed the opium trade in 1796 and 1800, but British merchants continued illegally nonetheless. The Qing took measures to prevent the East India Company from selling opium, and destroyed tens of thousands of chests of opium already in the country. This series of events led to the First Opium War in 1839, which involved a succession of British naval attacks along the Chinese coast over the course of several months. As part of the Treaty of Nanjing in 1842, the Qing were forced to give British merchants special treatment and the right to sell opium. The Chinese also ceded territory to the British, including the island of Hong Kong.\nForming a complete monopoly.\nTrade monopoly.\nThe prosperity that the officers of the company enjoyed allowed them to return to Britain and establish sprawling estates and businesses, and to obtain political power, such as seats in the House of Commons. Ship captains sold their appointments to successors for up to \u00a3500. As recruits aimed to return to Britain wealthy by securing Indian money, their loyalties to their homeland increased.\nThe company developed a lobby in the English parliament. Pressure from ambitious tradesmen and former company associates (pejoratively termed \"Interlopers\" by the company), who wanted to establish private trading firms in India, led to the passing of the deregulating act in 1694.\nThis act allowed any English firm to trade with India, unless specifically prohibited by act of parliament, thereby annulling the charter that had been in force for almost 100 years. When the East India Company Act 1697 (9 Will. 3. c. 44) was passed in 1697, a new \"parallel\" East India Company (officially titled the \"English Company Trading to the East Indies\") was floated under a state-backed indemnity of \u00a32\u00a0million. The powerful stockholders of the old company quickly subscribed a sum of \u00a3315,000 in the new concern, and dominated the new body. The two companies wrestled with each other for some time, both in England and in India, for a dominant share of the trade.\nIt quickly became evident that, in practice, the original company faced scarcely any measurable competition. The companies merged in 1708, by a tripartite indenture involving both companies and the state, with the charter and agreement for the new \"United Company of Merchants of England Trading to the East Indies\" being awarded by Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin. Under this arrangement, the merged company lent a sum of \u00a33,200,000 to the Treasury, in return for exclusive privileges for the next three years, after which the situation was to be reviewed. The amalgamated company became the \"United Company of Merchants of England Trading to the East Indies\".\nA constant battle between the company lobby and Parliament followed for decades. The company sought a permanent establishment, while Parliament would not willingly allow it greater autonomy and so relinquish the opportunity to exploit the company's profits. In 1712, another act renewed the status of the company, though the debts were repaid. By 1720, 15% of British imports were from India, almost all passing through the company, which reasserted the influence of the company lobby. The licence was prolonged until 1766 by yet another act in 1730.\nAt this time, Britain and France became bitter rivals. Frequent skirmishes between them took place for control of colonial possessions. In 1742, fearing the monetary consequences of a war, the British government agreed to extend the deadline for the licensed exclusive trade by the company in India until 1783, in return for a further loan of \u00a31\u00a0million. Between 1756 and 1763, the Seven Years' War diverted the state's attention towards consolidation and defence of its territorial possessions in Europe and its colonies in North America.\nThe war partly took place in the Indian theatre, between the company troops and the French forces. In 1757, the Law Officers of the Crown delivered the Pratt\u2013Yorke opinion distinguishing overseas territories acquired by right of conquest from those acquired by private treaty. The opinion asserted that, while the Crown of Great Britain enjoyed sovereignty over both, only the property of the former was vested in the Crown.\nWith the advent of the Industrial Revolution, Britain surged ahead of its European rivals. Demand for Indian commodities was boosted by the need to sustain troops and the economy during the war, and by the increased availability of raw materials and efficient methods of production. As home to the revolution, Britain experienced higher standards of living. Its ever-growing cycle of prosperity, demand and production had a profound influence on overseas trade. The company became the single largest player in the British global market. In 1801 Henry Dundas reported to the House of Commons that\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... on the\u00a01st March, 1801, the debts of the East India Company amounted to 5,393,989\"l.\" their effects to 15,404,736\"l.\" and that their sales had increased since February 1793, from 4,988,300\"l.\" to 7,602,041\"l.\"\nSaltpetre trade.\nSir John Banks, a businessman from Kent who negotiated an agreement between the king and the company, began his career in a syndicate arranging contracts for victualling the navy, an interest he kept up for most of his life. He knew that Samuel Pepys and John Evelyn had amassed a substantial fortune from the Levant and Indian trades.\nHe became a director and later, as governor of the East India Company in 1672, he arranged a contract which included a loan of \u00a320,000 and \u00a330,000 worth of saltpetre\u2014also known as potassium nitrate, a primary ingredient in gunpowder\u2014for the King \"at the price it shall sell by the candle\"\u2014that is by auction\u2014where bidding could continue as long as an inch-long candle remained alight.\nOutstanding debts were also agreed and the company permitted to export 250 tons of saltpetre. Again in 1673, Banks successfully negotiated another contract for 700 tons of saltpetre at \u00a337,000 between the king and the company. So high was the demand from armed forces that the authorities sometimes turned a blind eye on the untaxed sales. One governor of the company was even reported as saying in 1864 that he would rather have the saltpetre made than the tax on salt.\nBasis for the monopoly.\nColonial monopoly.\nThe Seven Years' War (1756\u20131763) resulted in the defeat of the French forces, limited French imperial ambitions, and stunted the influence of the Industrial Revolution in French territories. Robert Clive, the Governor-General, led the company to a victory against Joseph Fran\u00e7ois Dupleix, the commander of the French forces in India, and recaptured Fort St George from the French. The company took this respite to seize Manila in 1762.\nBy the Treaty of Paris, France regained the five establishments captured by the British during the war (Pondich\u00e9ry, Mahe, Karaikal, Yanam and Chandernagar) but was prevented from erecting fortifications and keeping troops in Bengal (art. XI). Elsewhere in India, the French were to remain a military threat, particularly during the War of American Independence, and up to the capture of Pondich\u00e9ry in 1793 at the outset of the French Revolutionary Wars without any military presence. Although these small outposts remained French possessions for the next two hundred years, French ambitions on Indian territories were effectively laid to rest, thus eliminating a major source of economic competition for the company.\nIn May 1772 the EIC stock price rose significantly. In June Alexander Fordyce lost \u00a3300,000 shorting EIC stock, leaving his partners liable for an estimated \u00a3243,000 in debts. As this information became public, 20\u201330 banks across Europe collapsed during the British credit crisis of 1772\u20131773. In India alone, the company had bill debts of \u00a31.2 million. It seems that EIC directors James Cockburn and George Colebrooke were \"bulling\" the Amsterdam market during 1772. The root of this crisis in relation to the East India Company came from the prediction by Isaac de Pinto that 'peace conditions plus an abundance of money would push East Indian shares to 'exorbitant heights.'\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In September the company took out a loan from the Bank of England, to be repaid from the sale of goods later that month. But with buyers scarce,\nmost of the sale had to be postponed, and when the loan fell due, the company's coffers were empty. On October 29 the bank refused to renew the loan. That decision set in motion a chain of events that made the American Revolution inevitable. The East India Company had eighteen million pounds of tea sitting in British warehouses. A huge amount of tea as assets which were lying unsold. Selling it in a hurry would do wonders for its finances.\nOn 14 January 1773 the directors of the EIC asked for a government loan and unlimited access to the tea market in the American colonies, both of which were granted. In August 1773 the Bank of England assisted the EIC with a loan.\nThe East India Company had also been granted competitive advantages over colonial American tea importers to sell tea from its colonies in Asia in American colonies. This led to the Boston Tea Party of 1773 in which protesters boarded British ships and threw the tea overboard. When protesters successfully prevented the unloading of tea in three other colonies and in Boston, Governor Thomas Hutchinson of the Province of Massachusetts Bay refused to allow the tea to be returned to Britain. This was one of the incidents which led to the American Revolution and independence of the American colonies.\nThe company's trade monopoly with India was abolished in the Charter Act 1813. The monopoly with China was ended in 1833, ending the trading activities of the company and rendering its activities purely administrative.\nDisestablishment.\nIn the aftermath of the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and under the provisions of the Government of India Act 1858, the British Government nationalised the company. The British government took over its Indian possessions, its administrative powers and machinery, and its armed forces.\nThe company had already divested itself of its commercial trading assets in India in favour of the UK government in 1833, with the latter assuming the debts and obligations of the company, which were to be serviced and paid from tax revenue raised in India. In return, the shareholders voted to accept an annual dividend of 10.5%, guaranteed for forty years, likewise to be funded from India, with a final pay-off to redeem outstanding shares. The debt obligations continued beyond dissolution and were only extinguished by the UK government during the Second World War.\nThe company remained in existence in vestigial form, continuing to manage the tea trade on behalf of the British Government (and the supply of Saint Helena) until the East India Stock Dividend Redemption Act 1873 came into effect, on 1 January 1874. This act provided for the formal dissolution of the company on 1 June 1874, after a final dividend payment and the commutation or redemption of its stock. \"The Times\" commented on 8 April 1873:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It accomplished a work such as in the whole history of the human race no other trading Company ever attempted, and such as none, surely, is likely to attempt in the years to come.\nEstablishments in Britain.\nThe company's headquarters in London, from which much of India was governed, was East India House in Leadenhall Street. After occupying premises in Philpot Lane from 1600 to 1621; in Crosby House, Bishopsgate from 1621 to 1638; and in Leadenhall Street from 1638 to 1648, the company moved into Craven House, an Elizabethan mansion in Leadenhall Street. The building had become known as East India House by 1661. It was completely rebuilt and enlarged in 1726\u20131729 and further significantly remodelled and expanded in 1796\u20131800. It was finally vacated in 1860 and demolished in 1861\u20131862. The site is now occupied by the Lloyd's building.\nIn 1607, the company decided to build its own ships and leased a yard on the River Thames at Deptford. By 1614, the yard having become too small, an alternative site was acquired at Blackwall: the new yard was fully operational by 1617. It was sold in 1656, although for some years East India Company ships continued to be built and repaired there under the new owners.\nIn 1803 an act of Parliament, promoted by the East India Company, established the East India Dock Company, with the aim of establishing a new set of docks (the East India Docks) primarily for the use of ships trading with India. The existing Brunswick Dock, part of the Blackwall Yard site, became the Export Dock; while a new Import Dock was built to the north. In 1838 the East India Dock Company merged with the West India Dock Company. The docks were taken over by the Port of London Authority in 1909 and closed in 1967.\nThe East India College was founded in 1806 as a training establishment for \"writers\" (i.e. clerks) in the company's service. It was initially located in Hertford Castle, but moved in 1809 to purpose-built premises at Hertford Heath, Hertfordshire. In 1858 the college closed; but in 1862 the buildings reopened as a public school, now Haileybury and Imperial Service College.\nThe East India Company Military Seminary was founded in 1809 at Addiscombe, near Croydon, Surrey, to train young officers for service in the company's armies in India. It was based in Addiscombe Place, an early 18th-century mansion. The government took it over in 1858 and renamed it the Royal Indian Military College. In 1861 it was closed, and the site was subsequently redeveloped.\nIn 1818, the company entered into an agreement by which those of its servants who were certified insane in India might be cared for at Pembroke House, Hackney, London, a private lunatic asylum run by Dr George Rees until 1838, and thereafter by Dr William Williams. The arrangement outlasted the company itself, continuing until 1870, when the India Office opened its own asylum, the Royal India Asylum, at Hanwell, Middlesex.\nThe East India Club in London was formed in 1849 for officers of the company. The Club still exists today as a private gentlemen's club with its club house situated at 16 St James's Square, London.\nSymbols.\nFlags.\nThe English East India Company flag changed over time, with a canton based on the flag of the contemporary Kingdom, and a field of 9-to-13\u00a0alternating red and white stripes.\nFrom 1600, the canton consisted of a St George's Cross representing the Kingdom of England. With the Acts of Union 1707, the canton was changed to the new Union Flag\u2014consisting of an English St George's Cross combined with a Scottish St Andrew's cross\u2014representing the Kingdom of Great Britain. After the Acts of Union 1800 that joined Ireland with Great Britain to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the canton of the East India Company flag was altered accordingly to include a Saint Patrick's Saltire.\nThere has been much debate about the number and order of stripes in the field of the flag. Historical documents and paintings show variations from 9-to-13\u00a0stripes, with some images showing the top stripe red and others showing it white.\nAt the time of the American Revolution the East India Company flag was nearly identical to the Continental Union Flag. Historian Charles Fawcett argued that the East India Company Flag inspired the Stars and Stripes of America.\nCoat of arms.\nThe East India Company's original coat of arms was granted in 1600. The blazon of the arms is as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Arms: \"Azure, three ships with three masts, rigged and under full sail, the sails, pennants and ensigns Argent, each charged with a cross Gules; on a chief of the second a pale quarterly Azure and Gules, on the 1st and 4th a fleur-de-lis or, on the 2nd and 3rd a leopard or, between two roses Gules seeded Or barbed Vert.\"\nCrest: \"A sphere without a frame, bounded with the Zodiac in bend Or, between two pennants flottant Argent, each charged with a cross Gules, over the sphere the words \" (Latin: God Indicates).\nSupporters: \"Two sea lions Or, the tails proper.\"\nMotto: \"\" (Latin: Where God Leads, Nothing Harms)\nThe East India Company's later arms, granted in 1698, were:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Arms: \"Argent a cross Gules; in the dexter chief quarter an escutcheon of the arms of France and England quarterly, the shield ornamentally and regally crowned Or.\"\nCrest: \"A lion rampant guardant Or holding between the forepaws a regal crown proper.\"\nSupporters: \"Two lions rampant guardant Or, each supporting a banner erect Argent, charged with a cross Gules.\"\nMotto: (Latin: Under the auspices of the King and the Parliament of England). \nMerchant mark.\nWhen the East India Company was chartered in 1600, it was still customary for individual merchants or members of companies such as the Company of Merchant Adventurers to have a distinguishing merchant's mark which often included the mystical Sign of Four and served as a trademark. The East India Company's merchant mark consisted of a Sign of Four atop a heart within which was a saltire between the lower arms of which were the initials \"EIC\". This mark was a central motif of the East India Company's coinage and forms the central emblem displayed on the Scinde Dawk postage stamps.\nShips.\nShips of the East India Company were called East Indiamen or simply \"Indiamen\". Their names were sometimes prefixed with the initials \"HCS\", standing for \"Honourable Company's Service\" or \"Honourable Company's Ship\", such as and .\nDuring the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, the East India Company arranged for letters of marque for its vessels such as \"Lord Nelson\". This was not so that they could carry cannon to fend off warships, privateers, and pirates on their voyages to India and China (that they could do without permission) but so that, should they have the opportunity to take a prize, they could do so without being guilty of piracy. Similarly, \"Earl of Mornington\", an East India Company packet ship of only six guns, also sailed under a letter of marque.\nIn addition, the company had its own navy, the Bombay Marine, equipped with warships such as . These vessels often accompanied vessels of the Royal Navy on expeditions, such as the Invasion of Java.\nAt the Battle of Pulo Aura, which was probably the company's most notable naval victory, Nathaniel Dance, Commodore of a convoy of Indiamen and sailing aboard the , led several Indiamen in a skirmish with a French squadron, driving them off. Some six years earlier, on 28 January 1797, five Indiamen, \"Woodford\", under Captain Charles Lennox, \"Taunton-Castle\", Captain Edward Studd, \"Canton\", Captain Abel Vyvyan, \"Boddam\", Captain George Palmer, and , Captain John Christian Lochner, had encountered Admiral de Sercey and his squadron of frigates. On this occasion the Indiamen succeeded in bluffing their way to safety, and without any shots even being fired. Lastly, on 15 June 1795, \"General Goddard\" played a large role in the capture of seven Dutch East Indiamen off St Helena.\nEast Indiamen were large and strongly built, and when the Royal Navy was desperate for vessels to escort merchant convoys, it bought several of them to convert to warships. \"Earl of Mornington\" became HMS \"Drake\". Other examples include:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTheir design as merchant vessels meant that their performance in the warship role was underwhelming and the Navy converted them to transports.\nThe amount of trade and shipping between Britain and company ports in India was considerable. For instance, in 1844, 534 ships (247,087 tons) arrived in Britain, and 540 vessels (239,368 tons) left UK ports for British India.\nRecords.\nUnlike all other British Government records, the records from the East India Company (and its successor the India Office) are not in The National Archives at Kew, London, but are held by the British Library in London as part of the Asia, Pacific and Africa Collections. The catalogue is searchable online in the \"Access to Archives\" catalogues. Many of the East India Company records are freely available online under an agreement that the Families in British India Society has with the British Library. Published catalogues exist of East India Company ships' journals and logs, 1600\u20131834; accompanying catalogues also cover the company's daughter institutions, including the East India Company College, Haileybury, and Addiscombe Military Seminary.\n\"The Asiatic Journal and Monthly Register for British India and its Dependencies\", first issued in 1816, was sponsored by the East India Company, and includes much information relating to its work.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "43282", "revid": "1682772", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43282", "title": "Leonard Bernstein", "text": "American conductor and composer (1918\u20131990)\nLeonard Bernstein ( ; born Louis Bernstein; August 25, 1918 \u2013 October 14, 1990) was an American conductor, composer, pianist, music educator, author, and humanitarian. Considered to be one of the most important conductors of his time, he was the first American-born conductor to receive international acclaim. Bernstein was \"one of the most prodigiously talented and successful musicians in American history\" according to music critic Donal Henahan. Bernstein's honors and accolades include seven Emmy Awards, two Tony Awards, and 16 Grammy Awards (including the Lifetime Achievement Award) as well as an Academy Award nomination. He received the Kennedy Center Honor in 1981.\nAs a composer, Bernstein wrote in many genres, including symphonic and orchestral music, ballet, film and theatre music, choral works, opera, chamber music, and pieces for the piano. Bernstein's works include the Broadway musical \"West Side Story\", which continues to be regularly performed worldwide, and has been adapted into two (1961 and 2021) feature films, as well as three symphonies, \"Serenade (after Plato's Symposium)\" (1954) and \"Chichester Psalms\" (1965), the original score for Elia Kazan's \"On the Waterfront\" (1954), and theater works including \"On the Town\" (1944), \"Wonderful Town\" (1953), \"Candide\" (1956), and his \"Mass\" (1971).\nBernstein was the first American-born conductor to lead a major American symphony orchestra. He was music director of the New York Philharmonic and conducted the world's major orchestras, generating a legacy of audio and video recordings. Bernstein was also a critical figure in the modern revival of the music of Gustav Mahler, in whose music he was most interested. A skilled pianist, Bernstein often conducted piano concertos from the keyboard. He shared and explored classical music on television with a mass audience in national and international broadcasts, including Young People's Concerts with the New York Philharmonic.\nBernstein worked in support of civil rights; protested against the Vietnam War; advocated nuclear disarmament; raised money for HIV/AIDS research and awareness; championed Janis Ian at age 15 and her song about interracial love, \"Society's Child\", on his CBS television show; and engaged in multiple international initiatives for human rights and world peace. He conducted Mahler's \"Resurrection Symphony\" to mark the death of president John F. Kennedy, and in Israel at a concert, \"Hatikvah on Mt. Scopus\", after the Six-Day War. The sequence of events was recorded for a documentary entitled \"Journey to Jerusalem\". Bernstein was a member of the executive committee for Writers and Artists for Peace in the Middle East, a pro-Israel group. On Christmas Day, 1989, Bernstein conducted a performance of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 in Berlin to celebrate the fall of the Berlin Wall. Less than a year later, in October 1990, he died of heart attack in New York, aged 72.\nEarly life and education.\n1918\u20131935: Early life and family.\nBernstein was born in Lawrence, Massachusetts, to Jewish parents of Russian/ Ukrainian heritage, Jennie (n\u00e9e Resnick) and Samuel Joseph Bernstein, both immigrants to the United States from Rivne, Russian Empire (now in Ukraine). His grandmother insisted that his first name officially be Louis, but his parents always called him Leonard. He legally changed his name to Leonard when he was 16. To his friends and many others, he was simply known as \"Lenny.\"\nHis mother had moved in with her parents, in Lawrence, toward the end of her pregnancy with Leonard, her first child. Since he was sickly as an infant, he stayed there until he was strong enough for him and his mother to join his father in Boston. There, the boy attended the William Lloyd Garrison School and then the Boston Latin School, where he and classmate Lawrence F. Ebb wrote the class song. When Leonard was 15, the family moved to nearby Newton, Massachusetts.\nSamuel became a wealthy man as the owner of the Samuel J. Bernstein Hair Company, which, in the 1920s and 1930s, held the exclusive distribution rights for the Frederick's Permanent Wave Machine.\nIn Leonard's early years, his main exposure to music was on Friday nights at Congregation Mishkan Tefila, in the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston. When Bernstein was 10 years old, his Aunt Clara, Samuel's sister, deposited her upright piano at their house. Young Bernstein asked for lessons and subsequently studied with a variety of piano teachers, including Helen Coates, who would later become his secretary. In the summers, the Bernstein family would retreat to their vacation home in Sharon, Massachusetts, where Leonard conscripted all the neighborhood children to put on shows, ranging from Bizet's \"Carmen\" to Gilbert and Sullivan's \"H.M.S. Pinafore\". He and his two younger siblings, Shirley and Burton, remained close their entire lives.\nSamuel initially opposed Leonard's interest in music and attempted to discourage it by refusing to pay for his son's piano lessons. So, Leonard took to giving lessons to young people in his neighborhood. One of his students, Sid Ramin, would become a beloved lifelong friend and Bernstein's orchestrator (along with Irwin Kostal) for \"West Side Story\".\nEventually, Samuel came around, taking his son to orchestral concerts in his teenage years and ultimately supporting his music studies, as well. In May 1932, Leonard attended his first orchestral concert with the Boston Pops, conducted by Arthur Fiedler. There, Bernstein first heard Ravel's \"Bol\u00e9ro\", which impressed him greatly.\nOn March 30, 1932, Bernstein played Brahms's Rhapsody in G minor at his first public piano performance in Susan Williams's studio recital at the New England Conservatory of Music. Two years later, he made his debut as a soloist with an orchestra, playing Grieg's Piano Concerto in A minor with the Boston Public School Orchestra.\nAmong his strong musical influences was George Gershwin. When news came of Gershwin's death, in July 1937, Bernstein, then a music counselor at a summer camp, interrupted lunch in the mess hall and played Gershwin's second \"Prelude\" as a memorial.\n1935\u20131941: College years.\nHarvard University \nIn 1935, Bernstein enrolled at Harvard College, where he studied music with, among others, composers Edward Burlingame Hill and Walter Piston. Bernstein's first extant composition, Psalm 148, for voice and piano, is dated 1935. He majored in music with a senior thesis entitled \"The Absorption of Race Elements into American Music\" (1939; reproduced in his book \"Findings\"). One of Bernstein's intellectual influences at Harvard was aesthetics professor David Prall, and one of his friends at the school was future philosopher Donald Davidson. Bernstein wrote and conducted the musical score for Davidson's production of the Aristophanes play \"The Birds\", performed in the original Greek. Bernstein recycled some of this music in future works. While a student, Bernstein composed for the Harvard Glee Club and was briefly its president while also serving as the unpaid pianist for Harvard Film Society's silent film presentations.\nBernstein mounted a student production of \"The Cradle Will Rock\", directing its action from the piano as the composer Marc Blitzstein had done at the premiere. Blitzstein, who attended the performance, subsequently became a close friend and mentor to Bernstein. As a sophomore at Harvard, Bernstein met the conductor Dimitri Mitropoulos, who was an influence on Bernstein's eventual decision to become a conductor. Mitropoulos invited Bernstein to come to Minneapolis for the 1940\u201341 season to be his assistant, but the plan fell through because of union issues. In 1937, Bernstein sat next to Aaron Copland at a dance recital at Town Hall in New York City. Copland invited Bernstein to his birthday party afterwards, where Bernstein impressed the guests by playing Copland's challenging Piano Variations. Although he was never a formal student of Copland's, Bernstein regularly sought his advice, often citing him as \"the closest thing to a composition teacher [Bernstein] ever had.\" Bernstein graduated from Harvard in 1939 with a Bachelor of Arts, \"cum laude\".\nCurtis Institute of Music \nAfter graduating from Harvard, Bernstein enrolled at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. At Curtis, Bernstein studied conducting with Fritz Reiner; piano with Isabelle Vengerova; orchestration with Randall Thompson; counterpoint with Richard St\u00f6hr; and score reading with Ren\u00e9e Longy-Miquelle. In 1940, Bernstein attended the inaugural year of the Berkshire Music Center, the Boston Symphony Orchestra's summer home. Bernstein studied conducting with the BSO's music director, Serge Koussevitzky, who became a profound lifelong inspiration to Bernstein. He became Koussevitzky's conducting assistant at Tanglewood and later dedicated his Symphony No. 2: \"The Age of Anxiety\" to Koussevitzky. One of Bernstein's classmates, both at Curtis and at Tanglewood, was Lukas Foss, who remained a lifelong friend and colleague. Bernstein returned to Tanglewood nearly every summer for the rest of his life to teach and conduct the young music students. Bernstein received a diploma in conducting from Curtis in 1941.\nCareer.\n1940s: Rise to prominence.\nSoon after he left Curtis, Bernstein moved to New York City where he lived in various apartments in Manhattan. Bernstein supported himself by coaching singers, teaching piano, and playing the piano for dance classes in Carnegie Hall. He found work with Harms-Witmark, transcribing jazz and pop music and publishing his work under the pseudonym \"Lenny Amber\". (\"Bernstein\" means \"amber\" in German.)\nBernstein briefly shared an apartment in Greenwich Village with his friend Adolph Green. Green was then part of a satirical music troupe called The Revuers, featuring Betty Comden and Judy Holliday. With Bernstein sometimes providing piano accompaniment, The Revuers often performed at the legendary jazz club the Village Vanguard. On April 21, 1942, Bernstein performed the premiere of his first published work, \"Sonata for Clarinet and Piano\", with clarinetist David Glazer at the Institute of Modern Art in Boston.\nNew York Philharmonic conducting debut.\nBernstein would later make his New York Philharmonic conducting debut. On November 14, 1943, having recently been appointed assistant conductor to Artur Rodzi\u0144ski of the New York Philharmonic, Bernstein made his major conducting debut at short notice\u2014and without any rehearsal\u2014after guest conductor Bruno Walter came down with the flu. The challenging program included works by Robert Schumann, Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa, Richard Wagner, and Richard Strauss.\nThe next day, \"The New York Times\" carried the story on its front page and remarked in an editorial, \"It's a good American success story. The warm, friendly triumph of it filled Carnegie Hall and spread far over the air waves.\" Many newspapers throughout the country carried the story, which, in combination with the concert's live national CBS Radio Network broadcast, propelled Bernstein to instant fame. Over the next two years, Bernstein made conducting debuts with ten different orchestras in the United States and Canada, greatly broadening his repertoire and initiating a lifelong frequent practice of conducting concertos from the piano.\nOn January 28, 1944, Bernstein conducted the premiere of his Symphony No. 1: \"Jeremiah\" with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra and soloist Jennie Tourel. In the fall of 1943, Bernstein and Jerome Robbins began work on their first collaboration, \"Fancy Free\", a ballet about three young sailors on leave in wartime New York City. \"Fancy Free\" premiered on April 18, 1944, with the Ballet Theatre (now the American Ballet Theatre) at the old Metropolitan Opera House, with scenery by Oliver Smith and costumes by Kermit Love.\nBernstein and Robbins decided to expand the ballet into a musical and invited Comden and Green to write the book and lyrics. \"On the Town\" opened on Broadway's Adelphi Theatre on December 28, 1944. The show resonated with audiences during World War II, and it broke race barriers on Broadway: Japanese-American dancer Sono Osato in a leading role; a multiracial cast dancing as mixed race couples; and a Black concertmaster, Everett Lee, who eventually took over as music director of the show. \"On the Town\" became an MGM motion picture in 1949, starring Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra, and Jules Munshin as the three sailors. Only part of Bernstein's score was used in the film and additional songs were provided by Roger Edens.\nFrom 1945 to 1947, Bernstein was the music director of the New York City Symphony, which had been founded the previous year by the conductor Leopold Stokowski. The orchestra (with support from Mayor Fiorello La Guardia) had modern programs and affordable tickets. In 1946, Bernstein made his overseas debut with the Czech Philharmonic at the inaugural Prague Spring International Music Festival. He also recorded Ravel's Piano Concerto in G major as soloist and conductor with the Philharmonia Orchestra. On July 4, 1946, Bernstein conducted the European premiere of \"Fancy Free\" with the Ballet Theatre at the Royal Opera House in London. On August 6 he conducted opera professionally for the first time, with the American premiere of Benjamin Britten's \"Peter Grimes\" at Tanglewood, commissioned by Koussevitzky. That same year, Arturo Toscanini invited Bernstein to guest conduct two concerts with the NBC Symphony Orchestra, one of which featured Bernstein as soloist in Ravel's Piano Concerto in G major.\nIsrael Philharmonic Orchestra, television debut and Tanglewood.\nIn 1947, Bernstein conducted in Tel Aviv for the first time, beginning a lifelong association with the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, then known as the Palestine Symphony Orchestra. The next year, he conducted an open-air concert for Israeli troops at Beersheba in the middle of the desert during the Arab-Israeli war. In 1957, he conducted the inaugural concert of the Mann Auditorium in Tel Aviv. In 1967, he conducted a concert on Mount Scopus to commemorate the Reunification of Jerusalem, featuring Mahler's Symphony No. 2 and Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto with soloist Isaac Stern. The city of Tel Aviv added his name to the Habima Square (Orchestra Plaza) in the center of the city. On December 10, 1949, Bernstein made his first television appearance as conductor with the Boston Symphony Orchestra at Carnegie Hall. The concert, which included an address by Eleanor Roosevelt, celebrated the first anniversary of the United Nations General Assembly's ratification of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and included the premiere of Aaron Copland's \"Preamble for a Solemn Occasion\" with Sir Laurence Olivier narrating text from the UN Charter. The concert was televised by NBC Television Network. In April 1949, Bernstein performed as piano soloist in the world premiere of his Symphony No. 2: The Age of Anxiety with Koussevitzy conducting the Boston Symphony Orchestra. On December 2, 1949, Bernstein conducted the world premiere of the Messiaen's \"Turangal\u00eela-Symphonie\", with the Boston Symphony Orchestra and the New York premiere in Carnegie Hall on the afternoon of December 10. Part of the rehearsal for the concert was recorded and released by the orchestra. When Koussevitzky died in 1951, Bernstein became head of the orchestra and conducting departments at Tanglewood.\n1950s: Career expansion and \"West Side Story\".\nThe 1950s comprised the most active years of Bernstein's career. He created five new works for the Broadway stage, composed several symphonic works and an iconic film score, and was appointed music director of the New York Philharmonic with whom he toured the world, including concerts behind the Iron Curtain. Bernstein also harnessed the power of television to expand his educational reach, and he married and started a family. In 1950, Bernstein composed incidental music for a Broadway production of J. M. Barrie's play \"Peter Pan\". The production, which opened on Broadway on April 24, 1950, starred Jean Arthur as Peter Pan and Boris Karloff in the dual roles of George Darling and Captain Hook. The show ran for 321 performances.\nIn 1951, Bernstein composed \"Trouble in Tahiti\", a one-act opera in seven scenes with an English libretto by the composer. The opera portrays the troubled marriage of a couple whose idyllic suburban post-war environment belies their inner turmoil. Ironically, Bernstein wrote most of the opera while on his honeymoon in Mexico with his wife, Felicia Montealegre. Bernstein was a visiting music professor at Brandeis University from 1951 to 1956. In 1952, he created the Brandeis Festival of the Creative Arts, where he conducted the premiere of \"Trouble in Tahiti\" on June 12 of that year. The NBC Opera Theatre subsequently presented the opera on television in November 1952. It opened on Broadway at the Playhouse Theatre on April 19, 1955, and ran for six weeks. Three decades later, Bernstein wrote a second opera, \"A Quiet Place\", which picked up the story and characters of \"Trouble in Tahiti\" in a later period.\n \"Wonderful Town\" (1953) \nIn 1953, Bernstein wrote the score for the musical \"Wonderful Town\" on very short notice, with a book by Joseph A. Fields and Jerome Chodorov and lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green. Like the 1940 play, directed on Broadway by George S. Kaufman, it is based on the autobiographical short stories, collectively titled \"My Sister Eileen\", that were written by Ruth McKenney and published in the early 1930s by \"The New Yorker\". They tell the story of two sisters from Ohio who move to New York City and seek success from their squalid basement apartment in Greenwich Village. \"Wonderful Town\" opened on Broadway on February 25, 1953, at the Winter Garden Theatre, starring Rosalind Russell in the role of Ruth Sherwood, Edie Adams as Eileen Sherwood, and George Gaynes as Robert Baker. It won five Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Actress.\n \"Candide\" (1956) \nIn the three years leading up to Bernstein's appointment as music director of the New York Philharmonic, Bernstein was simultaneously working on the scores for two Broadway shows. The first of the two was the operetta-style musical \"Candide.\" Lillian Hellman originally brought Bernstein her idea of adapting Voltaire's novella. The original collaborators on the show were book writer John Latouche and lyricist Richard Wilbur. \"Candide\" opened on Broadway on December 1, 1956, at the Martin Beck Theatre, in a production directed by Tyrone Guthrie. Anxious about the parallels Hellman had deliberately drawn between Voltaire's story and the ongoing hearings conducted by the House Un-American Activities Committee, Guthrie persuaded the collaborators to cut their most incendiary sections prior to opening night. While the production was a box office disaster, running for only two months for a total of 73 performances, the cast album became a cult classic, which kept Bernstein's score alive. There have been several revivals, with modifications to improve the book. The elements of the music that have remained best known and performed over the decades are the Overture, which quickly became one of the most frequently performed orchestral compositions by a 20th century American composer; the coloratura aria \"Glitter and Be Gay\", which Barbara Cook sang in the original production; and the grand finale \"Make Our Garden Grow\".\n \"West Side Story\" (1957)\nThe other musical Bernstein was writing simultaneously with \"Candide\" was \"West Side Story\". Bernstein collaborated with director and choreographer Jerome Robbins, book writer Arthur Laurents, and lyricist Stephen Sondheim. The story is an updated retelling of Shakespeare's \"Romeo and Juliet\", set in the mid-1950s in the slums of New York City's Upper West Side. The Romeo character, Tony, is affiliated with the Jets gang, who are of white Northern European descent. The Juliet character is Maria, who is connected to the Sharks gang, recently arrived from Puerto Rico. The original Broadway production opened at the Winter Garden Theatre on September 26, 1957, and ran 732 performances. Robbins won the Tony Award for Best Choreographer, and Oliver Smith won the Tony for Best Scenic Designer.\nBernstein's score for \"West Side Story\" blends \"jazz, Latin rhythms, symphonic sweep and musical-comedy conventions in groundbreaking ways for Broadway\". It was orchestrated by Sid Ramin and Irwin Kostal following detailed instructions from Bernstein. The dark theme, sophisticated music, extended dance scenes, and focus on social problems marked a turning point in musical theatre. In 1960, Bernstein prepared a suite of orchestral music from the show, titled \"Symphonic Dances from West Side Story\", which continues to be popular with orchestras worldwide. A 1961 United Artists film adaptation, directed by Robert Wise and Robbins, starred Natalie Wood as Maria and Richard Beymer as Tony. The film won ten Academy Awards, including Best Picture and a ground-breaking Best Supporting Actress award for Puerto Rican-born Rita Moreno playing the role of Anita. A film adaptation directed by Steven Spielberg opened in 2021.\nIn addition to Bernstein's compositional activity for the stage, he wrote a symphonic work, \"Serenade after Plato's \"Symposium\"\" (1954); the score \"On the Waterfront\" (1954); and \"Prelude, Fugue and Riffs\", composed in 1949, but only premiered in 1955, for jazz big band and solo clarinet. In 1953, Bernstein became the first American conductor to appear at La Scala in Milan, conducting Cherubini's \"Medea\", with Maria Callas in the title role. Callas and Bernstein reunited at La Scala to perform Bellini's \"La sonnambula\" in 1955. On November 14, 1954, Bernstein presented the first of his television lectures for the CBS Television Network arts program \"Omnibus\". The live lecture, entitled \"Beethoven's Fifth Symphony\", involved Bernstein explaining the symphony's first movement with the aid of musicians from the \"Symphony of the Air\" (formerly NBC Symphony Orchestra). The program featured manuscripts from Beethoven's own hand, as well as a giant painting of the first page of the score covering the studio floor. Six more \"Omnibus\" lectures followed from 1955 to 1961 (later on ABC and then NBC) covering a broad range of topics: jazz, conducting, American musical comedy, modern music, J. S. Bach, and grand opera.\n Music director of the New York Philharmonic \nBernstein was appointed the music director of the New York Philharmonic in 1957, sharing the post jointly with Dimitri Mitropoulos until he took sole charge in 1958. Bernstein held the music directorship until 1969 when he was appointed \"Laureate Conductor\". He continued to conduct and make recordings with the orchestra for the rest of his life. Bernstein's television teaching took a quantum leap when, as the new music director of the New York Philharmonic, he put the orchestra's traditional Saturday afternoon Young People's Concerts on the CBS Television Network. Millions of viewers of all ages and around the world enthusiastically embraced Bernstein and his engaging presentations about classical music. Bernstein often presented talented young performers on the broadcasts. Many of them became celebrated in their own right, including conductors Claudio Abbado and Seiji Ozawa; flutist Paula Robison; and pianist Andr\u00e9 Watts. From 1958 until 1972, the 53 Young People's Concerts comprised the most influential series of music education programs ever produced on television. They were highly acclaimed by critics and won numerous Emmy Awards.\nSome of Bernstein's scripts, all of which he wrote himself, were released in book form and on records. A recording of \"Humor in Music\" was awarded a Grammy award for Best Documentary or Spoken Word Recording (other than comedy) in 1961. The programs were shown in many countries around the world, often with Bernstein dubbed into other languages, and the concerts were later released on home video by Kultur Video.\nIn 1958, Bernstein and Mitropoulos led the New York Philharmonic on its first tour south of the border, through 12 countries in Central and South America. The United States Department of State sponsored the tour to improve the nation's relations with its southern neighbors. In 1959, the Department of State also sponsored Bernstein and the Philharmonic on a 50-concert tour through Europe and the Soviet Union, portions of which were filmed by the CBS Television Network. A highlight of the tour was Bernstein's performance of Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony, in the presence of the composer, who came on stage at the end to congratulate Bernstein and the musicians.\n1960s: Innovations and Lincoln Center.\n New York Philharmonic Innovations \nBernstein's innovative approach to themed programming included introducing audiences to composers less-performed at the time such as Gustav Mahler, Carl Nielsen, Jean Sibelius, and Charles Ives (including the world premiere of his Symphony No. 2). Bernstein actively advocated for the commission and performance of works by contemporary composers, conducting over 40 world premieres by a diverse roster of composers ranging from John Cage to Alberto Ginastera to Luciano Berio. He also conducted US premieres of 19 major works from around the globe, including works by Dmitri Shostakovich, Pierre Boulez, and Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti.\nBernstein championed American composers, especially those with whom he had a close friendship, such as Aaron Copland, William Schuman, and David Diamond. This decade saw a significant expansion of Bernstein and the Philharmonic's collaboration with Columbia Records, together they released over 400 compositions, covering a broad swath of the classical music canon. Bernstein welcomed the Philharmonic's additions of its first Black musician, Sanford Allen, and its second woman musician, Orin O'Brien. Bernstein also shared the Philharmonic's commitment to connecting with as many New Yorkers as possible. That vision became a reality with the launch of the Concerts in the Parks in 1965, which Bernstein conducted often. Another milestone was the Philharmonic's first visit to Japan in 1961, when Bernstein led acclaimed Philharmonic concerts and engaged in cultural exchange. Over the years, he led the Orchestra on tours to 144 cities in 38 countries.\nBernstein initiated the Philharmonic's informal Thursday Evening Preview Concerts, which included Bernstein's talks from the stage, a practice that was unheard of at the time. In one oft-reported incident, on April 6, 1962, Bernstein appeared on stage before a performance of the Brahms Piano Concerto No. 1 in D minor to explain that the soloist, Glenn Gould, had chosen an idiosyncratic approach to the work. Bernstein explained that while he did not totally agree with it, he thought Gould's interpretation was an artistically worthy exploration. Bernstein questioned: \"In a concerto, who is the boss: the soloist or the conductor?\" The incident created a stir that reverberated in the press for decades; see .\nIn 1960, Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic marked the centennial of Gustav Mahler's birth with a series of performances. The composer's widow, Alma, attended some of Bernstein's rehearsals. That same year, Bernstein made his first commercial recording of a Mahler symphony (the Fourth). Over the next seven years, he recorded the entire Mahler symphony cycle with the New York Philharmonic (except for the 8th Symphony, which was recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra). The combination of concert performances, television talks, and recordings led to a renewed interest in Mahler, especially in the United States. Bernstein claimed that he identified with the works on a personal level, and once wrote of the composer: \"I'm so sympathetic to Mahler: I understand his problem. It's like being two different men locked up in the same body; one man is a conductor and the other a composer ... It's like being a double man.\"\n Opening Lincoln Center \nOn May 14, 1959, President Dwight D. Eisenhower broke ground for Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. On September 23, 1962, the New York Philharmonic moved from Carnegie Hall to its new home, Philharmonic Hall (now David Geffen Hall). Bernstein conducted the gala opening concert featuring works by Mahler, Beethoven, and Vaughan Williams, as well as the premiere of Aaron Copland's \"Connotations\". In 1964, Bernstein conducted at the Metropolitan Opera for the first time in Franco Zeffirelli's production of Verdi's \"Falstaff\". In subsequent years, Bernstein returned to The Met to conduct \"Cavalleria rusticana\" (1970) and \"Carmen\" (1972), as well as at the Centennial Gala in 1983.\n An Artist's Response to Violence \nIn 1961, Bernstein composed and conducted a fanfare for President John F. Kennedy's pre-inaugural gala.\nOn November 23, 1963, the day after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Bernstein conducted the New York Philharmonic and the Schola Cantorum of New York in a nationally televised memorial featuring the Mahler's Symphony No. 2: \"Resurrection\". Later that week, in a speech to the United Jewish Appeal, Bernstein said: \"This will be our reply to violence: to make music more intensely, more beautifully, more devotedly than ever before.\" After Senator Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1968, Bernstein conducted the \"Adagietto\" movement from Mahler's Symphony No. 5 at the funeral mass.\n \"Kaddish\" and \"Chichester Psalms\" \nDue to his commitment to the New York Philharmonic and his many other activities, Bernstein had little time for composition during the 1960s, composing just two major works. His Symphony No. 3: \"Kaddish\" was written in 1963; Bernstein dedicated the work: \"To the Beloved Memory of John F. Kennedy.\" The work features a large orchestra, a full choir, a boys' choir, a soprano soloist, and a narrator. \"Kaddish\" refers to the Jewish prayer recited for the dead. Bernstein wrote the text of the narration himself; his wife, Felicia Montealegre, narrated the US premiere of the work.\nIn 1965, Bernstein took a sabbatical year from the New York Philharmonic to concentrate on composition, during which he composed \"Chichester Psalms.\" Commissioned by the Dean of Chichester Cathedral, Walter Hussey, the work premiered at Philharmonic Hall in New York City on July 15, 1965, conducted by Bernstein himself, and subsequently at Chichester Cathedral, conducted by the cathedral's Organist and Master of the Choristers, John Birch. For his text, Bernstein chose excerpts from the Book of Psalms in the original Hebrew. In 2018, Bernstein's Centennial year, \"Chichester Psalms\" was cited as the 5th-most performed concert work worldwide.\n Vienna Philharmonic debut \nIn 1966, Bernstein began a lifelong rich relationship with the Vienna Philharmonic, conducting concerts as well as making his debut at the Vienna State Opera in Luchino Visconti's production of \"Falstaff\" with Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau in the title role. Bernstein was largely responsible for restoring the works of Mahler to the Vienna Philharmonic's core repertoire. Bernstein recorded Mahler's Symphonies numerous times with the orchestra. Bernstein returned to the State Opera in 1968 for a production of \"Der Rosenkavalier\" and in 1970 for Otto Schenk's production of Beethoven's \"Fidelio\".\n1970s: \"Mass\", \"Dybbuk\" and international acclaim.\nDuring the 1970s, Bernstein's company, Amberson, in partnership with Unitel, produced and coordinated filmed recordings of his symphonic concerts around the world. For the rest of his life, Bernstein preferred to derive his audio recordings from live performances. Nearly 80% of Bernstein's recordings with his new recording partner, Deutsche Grammophon, were recorded live.\nBernstein's major compositions during the 1970s were his \"Mass: A Theatre Piece for Singers, Players, and Dancers\"; his score for the ballet \"Dybbuk\"; his orchestral vocal work \"\"; and his U.S. bicentennial musical \"1600 Pennsylvania Avenue\", with lyrics by Alan Jay Lerner, which was his last Broadway show and only theatrical flop.\n \"Mass: A Theatre Piece for Singers, Players, and Dancers\" (1971) \nIn 1966, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis commissioned Bernstein to compose a work for the inauguration of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., Bernstein began writing \"Mass\" in 1969 as a large-scale theatrical work based on the Tridentine Mass of the Catholic Church, and in 1971, Bernstein invited the young composer and lyricist Stephen Schwartz, who had recently opened the musical \"Godspell\" off-Broadway, to collaborate as co-lyricist. The world premiere took place on September 8, 1971, conducted by Maurice Peress, directed by Gordon Davidson, and choreographed by Alvin Ailey.\nBernstein's score combines elements of musical theater, jazz, gospel, blues, folk, rock, and symphonic music, and the libretto combines Latin and English liturgy, Hebrew prayer, and additional lyrics written by Bernstein and Schwartz.\n\"Mass\" received both rapturous and critical reactions, from audiences and music critics alike. While some members of the Catholic Church praised the piece's expression of contemporary crises of faith, others considered it blasphemous. (In 2000, Pope John Paul II requested a performance of \"Mass\" at the Vatican itself.) President Richard Nixon declined to attend the premiere due to its anti-Vietnam War message. Viewpoints on \"Mass\" continue to evolve over time, and Edward Seckerson wrote in 2021, 50 years after its premiere: \"Put simply, no other work of Bernstein's encapsulates exactly who he was as a man or as a musician; no other work displays his genius, his intellect, his musical virtuosity and innate theatricality quite like \"Mass\".\"\nThe album \"Mass\" peaked at No. 53 on the \"Billboard\" Top LPs, during a twenty-week run on the chart.\n The Unanswered Question: Six Talks at Harvard \nIn the 1972\u201373 academic year, Bernstein was appointed to the Charles Eliot Norton Chair as Professor of Poetry at Harvard, where he delivered six lectures, \"The Unanswered Question\", which explored such elements as tonality, harmony, and form through the lens of Noam Chomsky's linguistic theories. Bernstein provided musical examples from the piano, and pre-recorded musical works with the Boston Symphony Orchestra. Amberson arranged for the lectures to be videotaped at the WGBH studios in Boston. The six lectures were broadcast on PBS in 1976, and subsequently released on home video and published as a book.\n\"Dybbuk\" (1974)\nBernstein collaborated with Jerome Robbins to create \"Dybbuk\", a ballet based on S. Ansky's play of the same name. The ballet depicts Ansky's tale of a young woman possessed by a malicious spirit, known in Jewish folklore as a \"dybbuk\". \"Dybbuk\" was premiered by the New York City Ballet at the New York State Theater on May 16, 1974, with Bernstein conducting. A revision of the choreography and the score was made later the same year, titled \"Dybbuk Variations\". It received its premiere in November 1974.\n \"Songfest: A Cycle of American Poems for Six Singers and Orchestra\" \nBernstein's \"Songfest: A Cycle of American Poems for Six Singers and Orchestra\" premiered on October 11, 1977, the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., with the composer conducting the National Symphony Orchestra. The work was intended as a tribute to the 1976 American Bicentennial, but was not finished in time. The work sets an array of texts by 13 American poets spanning three centuries. Bernstein deliberately selected the widest possible array of literary voices to express the nation's essential diversity; the poets include June Jordan, Julia de Burgos, Walt Whitman, and Langston Hughes. On July 4, 1985, Bernstein conducted a nationally televised performance of \"Songfest\" as part of the National Symphony's annual \"A Capitol Fourth\" concert.\n International conducting and recordings \nAfter becoming Conductor Laureate of the New York Philharmonic in 1969, Bernstein took advantage of his freed-up schedule to increase the pace of his world travel, conducting twenty-nine orchestras throughout Europe, Asia, and the Americas, and making live recordings with them for both Unitel and Deutsche Grammophon. Bernstein founded Amberson Productions in 1969. In partnership with Unitel, Amberson created many video productions of concert performances, starting with Verdi's Requiem Mass in St. Paul's Cathedral with the London Symphony Orchestra in 1970, produced and directed by Humphrey Burton. Burton would go on to collaborate with Bernstein on his music video projects for the rest of Bernstein's life.\nIn 1972, Bernstein recorded Bizet's \"Carmen\", with Marilyn Horne in the title role and James McCracken as Don Jose, after leading several stage performances of the opera at the Metropolitan Opera. The recording was one of the first in stereo to use the original spoken dialogue between the sung portions of the opera. The recording was Bernstein's first for Deutsche Grammophon and won a Grammy. In working with Unitel and Deutsche Grammophon, Bernstein made a host of video and audio recordings with such orchestras as Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, Orchestre de Paris, Boston Symphony Orchestra, Orchestra Sinfonica di Roma della Rai, Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, and Orchestre National de France. In the late 1970s, Bernstein conducted a complete Beethoven symphony cycle with the Vienna Philharmonic, and cycles of Brahms and Schumann were to follow in the 1980s.\nAmong the many noteworthy Amberson productions with Unitel were Bernstein conducting Mahler's Symphony No. 2 \"Resurrection\" with the London Symphony Orchestra at Ely Cathedral in 1973 and \"Fidelio\" at the Vienna State Opera in 1978. In 1970, Bernstein wrote and narrated \"Bernstein on Beethoven: A Celebration in Vienna,\" an in-depth exploration of Beethoven on the composer's 200th birthday, filmed on location in and around Vienna. It features excerpts of Bernstein's rehearsals and performance of \"Fidelio\" at the Vienna State Opera, directed by Otto Schenk (which was later revived and filmed in 1978); Bernstein playing the Piano Concerto No. 1 and conducting from the piano; and a performance of Symphony No. 9 with the Vienna Philharmonic, featuring the young Pl\u00e1cido Domingo among the soloists. The show, produced and directed by Humphrey Burton, was broadcast around the world and won an Emmy Award.\nAlso recorded by Unitel, in October 1976, was Bernstein's concert in Munich with the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra and pianist Claudio Arrau to benefit Amnesty International. To honor his late wife and to continue their joint support for human rights, Bernstein subsequently established the Felicia Montealegre Bernstein Fund of Amnesty International USA to provide aid for human rights activists.\nIn 1979, Bernstein conducted the Berlin Philharmonic for the first and only time, in two charity concerts for Amnesty International featuring performances of Mahler's Ninth Symphony, recorded live on Deutsche Grammophon. The invitation for the concerts had come from the orchestra and not from its principal conductor Herbert von Karajan. There has been speculation about why Karajan never invited Bernstein to conduct his orchestra. The full reasons will probably never be known\u2014they were on friendly terms and respected each other, but sometimes practiced a little mutual one-upmanship such that they were described as fierce rivals. It was often suggested that Bernstein could not conduct in Berlin while Karajan was alive (the Berlin Philharmonic was regarded as Karajan's own), the truth was that Berlin Philharmonic's managing director Wolfgang Stresemann actually invited Bernstein but as part of a subscription concert series, which Bernstein disliked.\n1980s: \"A Quiet Place\", and Tanglewood.\nDuring the 1980s, Bernstein pursued a packed schedule, continuing to conduct, teach, compose, and produce several television documentaries. Bernstein's most significant compositions of the decade were his opera \"A Quiet Place\"; \"Divertimento for Orchestra\"; \"\u1e24alil\" for flute and orchestra; \"Concerto for Orchestra \"Jubilee Games\"\"; and the song cycle \"Arias and Barcarolles\". Bernstein received the Kennedy Center Honors award in 1980, a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1985, France's Legion of Honour (Commander) in 1985, and Japan's Praemium Imperiale in 1990, among others.\nIn the 1980s, Bernstein cemented his educational legacy by co-founding three music academies: Los Angeles Philharmonic Institute, Schleswig-Holstein Musik Festival Orchestral Academy, and the Pacific Music Festival. Bernstein continued his longtime relationship with Tanglewood to the end of his life, including a lavish televised gala in 1988 to celebrate his 70th birthday, as well as his final concert performance in August 1990.\n \"A Quiet Place\" (1983) \nIn 1983, Bernstein wrote a new opera, \"A Quiet Place\", with a libretto by Stephen Wadsworth. The opera premiered at the Houston Grand Opera on June 17, 1983, conducted by John DeMain. The opera was a sequel to Bernstein's 1951 opera \"Trouble in Tahiti\", which preceded the new opera at the premiere. In 1984, Bernstein and Wadsworth reconfigured \"A Quiet Place\" to include \"Trouble in Tahiti\" in its middle. This version was performed at La Scala and the Kennedy Center, with John Mauceri conducting. In 1986, Bernstein himself conducted and recorded the work at the Vienna State Opera.\n Conducting activities \nDuring the 1980s, in addition to continuing his productive relationship with the New York, Israel, and Vienna Philharmonics, Bernstein was also a regular guest conductor with several other major orchestras around the world. In Munich with the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, Bernstein recorded works including Wagner's \"Tristan und Isolde\"; Haydn's \"Creation\"; and Mozart's Requiem and \"Great Mass in C minor\". In Rome with the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia, Bernstein recorded works by Debussy, as well as Puccini's \"La boh\u00e8me\", featuring an all-American cast. In Amsterdam with Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, Bernstein recorded Mahler's Symphonies No. 1, 4, and 9, among other works.\nIn May 1986, the London Symphony Orchestra mounted a Bernstein Festival at the Barbican Centre, featuring a concert in which Bernstein conducted his own works. Queen Elizabeth II attended the performance. In December 1989, Bernstein conducted the London Symphony Orchestra in his operetta \"Candide\" and subsequently recorded the work at Abbey Road Studios. The recording starred Jerry Hadley, June Anderson, Christa Ludwig, and Adolph Green in the leading roles. The live concert from the Barbican Centre in London was captured on video.\n Ode to \"Freedom\" (1989)\nOn December 25, 1989, Bernstein conducted Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 in East Berlin's Konzerthaus as part of a celebration of the fall of the Berlin Wall. He had conducted the same work in West Berlin the previous day. The orchestra consisted of members representing the two German States and the four occupying powers of post-war Berlin. The Christmas Day concert was broadcast live to an estimated audience of 100 million people in more than twenty countries. For the occasion, Bernstein reworded Friedrich Schiller's text of the \"Ode to Joy\", replacing the word (joy) with the word (freedom). Bernstein added, \"I'm sure that Beethoven would have given us his blessing.\"\n Final concert at Tanglewood \nBernstein conducted his last concert on August 19, 1990, with the Boston Symphony Orchestra at Tanglewood. He led Benjamin Britten's \"Four Sea Interludes\" from \"Peter Grimes\" and Beethoven's Symphony No. 7. The program also included Bernstein's own \"Arias and Barcarolles\" in a new orchestration by Bright Sheng. However, poor health prevented Bernstein from preparing it, and Tanglewood Conducting Fellow Carl St. Clair was engaged to conduct the work in his stead.\nBernstein suffered a coughing fit during the third movement of the Beethoven, but continued to conduct the piece to its conclusion, leaving the stage during the ovation, appearing exhausted and in pain. The concert was later issued on CD as \"Leonard Bernstein \u2013 The Final Concert\" by Deutsche Grammophon.\n Amberson Productions \nBernstein's Amberson Productions continued its collaborations with Unitel throughout the 1980s. In 1982, PBS aired an Emmy-nominated series \"Bernstein/Beethoven\" featuring all nine Beethoven symphonies and other works using films that Unitel had recorded of Bernstein conducting the Vienna Philharmonic in the late 1970s. The series includes conversations between Bernstein and actor Maximilian Schell, who also read from Beethoven's letters.\nIn 1984, Bernstein conducted a Deutsche Grammophon recording of \"West Side Story\", his only recording of the entire work. The album, featuring opera singers Kiri Te Kanawa, Jos\u00e9 Carreras, Marilyn Horne, and Tatiana Troyanos, was an international bestseller. An Emmy-nominated film \"The Making of West Side Story\" documented the recording process.\nOther documentaries that Bernstein made during the 1980s include \"The Little Drummer Boy\", which delved into the music of Gustav Mahler, and \"The Love of Three Orchestras\", exploring his work with the New York, Vienna, and Israel Philharmonics.\n Educational activities\nBernstein's nurturing experience at the Tanglewood Music Festival inspired him to use his international influence to recreate that environment for young musicians in the final years of his life. During summer 1987, Bernstein celebrated the 100th anniversary of Nadia Boulanger at the American Conservatory in Fontainebleau. Bernstein gave a master class inside the castle of Fontainebleau.\n Los Angeles Philharmonic Institute \nIn 1982, Bernstein, with Los Angeles Philharmonic general manager Ernest Fleischmann and University of Southern California professor Daniel Lewis, co-founded the Los Angeles Philharmonic Institute, a summer training academy inspired by Tanglewood. Bernstein served as artistic co-director and taught conducting classes for two summers. During that time, he performed and recorded American works, including some of his own, with the Los Angeles Philharmonic for Deutsche Grammophon.\n Orchestra Academy of the Schleswig-Holstein Music Festival \nIn May 1986, Bernstein conducted the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra and Chorus for the inaugural concert of the Schleswig-Holstein Musik Festival, in a performance of Haydn's \"Die Sch\u00f6pfung\" (\"The Creation\"). He returned the following year when he founded the festival's Orchestra Academy, once again recreating the nurturing atmosphere of Bernstein's Tanglewood experience. Over three summers, Bernstein took the students on international tours to Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union.\nTo commemorate Bernstein's legacy as an educator and founder of the Orchestra Academy, the festival created the Leonard Bernstein Award in 2002, which has honored young musicians including Lang Lang, Jonathan Biss, and Alisa Weilerstein, among many others.\n Founding of the Pacific Music Festival \nIn 1990, Bernstein's final summer, he founded the Pacific Music Festival in Sapporo, Japan with Michael Tilson Thomas and the London Symphony Orchestra. The Festival's goal was to emphasize musical training for young students in the Pacific region.\nIn his opening address, Bernstein said: \"And my decision has been, without too much thought, to spend most of the remaining energy and time the Lord grants me in education and sharing, as much as possible, with younger people.\" As artistic director, Bernstein worked with the students in that first summer, but had to cut his time short due to ill health.\n Bernstein Education Through the Arts (BETA) Fund \nIn 1990, Bernstein received the Praemium Imperiale, an international prize awarded by the Japan Arts Association for lifetime achievement in the arts. Bernstein used the $100,000 prize to establish The Bernstein Education Through the Arts (BETA) Fund. He provided this grant to develop an arts-based education program. The Leonard Bernstein Center was posthumously established in April 1992, and initiated extensive school-based research, ultimately leading to the current Leonard Bernstein Artful Learning Program.\nPersonal life.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nBernstein had two younger siblings, Shirley and Burton. The three children lived with their parents, Samuel and Jennie, in the suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts, in a community of mostly Eastern European Jewish immigrants.\nBernstein had asthma, and the condition kept him from serving in the military during World War II.\nBernstein married actress Felicia Montealegre on September 9, 1951. They had three children: Jamie, Alexander, and Nina. The Bernstein family lived in New York City and Fairfield, Connecticut, and maintained a close-knit atmosphere surrounded by extended family and friends. The family owned a house in Redding, Connecticut, which they sold in 1964. Bernstein had a studio with a piano in each of his dwellings. The contents of his former studio at Fairfield, Connecticut are housed at the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music.\nThroughout his life, Bernstein had affairs with both men and women. In April 1943, he sought advice from Aaron Copland about living as a gay man in the public eye, a notion he brought up again in a letter to David Oppenheim in July of that year. In a private letter written after their marriage, Felicia acknowledged her husband's sexual orientation. She wrote him: \"You are a homosexual and may never change \u2013 you don't admit to the possibility of a double life, but if your peace of mind, your health, your whole nervous system depend on a certain sexual pattern what can you do?\"\nIn 1976, Bernstein left Felicia for a period to live in Northern California with Tom Cothran, a music scholar who had assisted him on research for the Charles Eliot Norton Lectures that Bernstein delivered at Harvard. The following year, Felicia was diagnosed with lung cancer. Bernstein moved back in with her and cared for her until her death on June 16, 1978.\nBernstein continued to have relationships with men until his death on October 14, 1990.\nWhen he was not composing and conducting, Bernstein enjoyed skiing, playing tennis, and engaging in all manner of word games, especially anagrams.\nDeath and legacy.\nBernstein announced his retirement from conducting on October 9, 1990. He died five days later at the age of 72, in his New York apartment at The Dakota, of a heart attack brought on by pleural tumor. A longtime heavy smoker, Bernstein had emphysema from his mid-50s. On the day of his funeral procession through the streets of Manhattan, construction workers removed their hats and waved, calling out \"Goodbye, Lenny\". Bernstein is buried near the summit of Battle Hill at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York, next to his wife and with a copy of the score of Mahler's Fifth Symphony lying across his heart.\nOn August 25, 2018 (the 100th anniversary of his birth), Bernstein was honored with a Google Doodle. The Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles created an exhibition titled \"Leonard Bernstein at 100\" for his centennial.\nBradley Cooper's drama film \"Maestro\" (2023) chronicles the relationship between Bernstein (played by Cooper) and his wife, Felicia Montealegre (played by Carey Mulligan). Produced by Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese, the film premiered at the Venice International Film Festival. As the Spotlight Gala feature of the 61st New York Film Festival, it was the first film presentation at the recently renovated David Geffen Hall in Lincoln Center, which was also where Bernstein had conducted as music director of the New York Philharmonic from its opening as Philharmonic Hall in 1962 until 1969.\nBernstein sought to make music both intelligible and enjoyable to all. Through his educational efforts, including several books and the creation of two major international music festivals, Bernstein influenced several generations of young musicians.\nSocial activism and humanitarian efforts.\nSince earliest adulthood, Bernstein was committed to furthering social change and making the world a better place. Throughout his life, Bernstein fought for a variety of political and humanitarian causes, from the civil rights movement to the Vietnam War protests to nuclear disarmament to advocacy during the AIDS crisis.\nBernstein's first public efforts for social change became apparent in 1939 when, as a college student at Harvard, he organized and led a performance of Marc Blitzstein's recently banned musical, \"The Cradle Will Rock\", about the struggles of the working class.\nFBI file.\nBernstein was involved in numerous left-wing causes and organizations since the 1940s, at which time the FBI began its decades-long monitoring of Bernstein's activities \"for his ties to communist organizations.\" In the 1980s, through the Freedom of Information Act, he was able to view his FBI file, which was over 800 pages long. In the early 1950s, he was briefly blacklisted by the United States Department of State and CBS, but he was never asked to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee.\nCivil rights.\nBernstein expressed his support of civil rights in the United States in numerous ways. Some examples include multiracial casting in \"On the Town\" in the 1940s, instigating blind auditions at the New York Philharmonic in the 1960s and the robust support of artists of color in classical music.\nOn March 24, 1965, at the invitation of Harry Belafonte, Bernstein participated in the Stars for Freedom Rally, a star-studded performance in support of the marchers heading from Selma to Montgomery to demand voting rights. The next day, Martin Luther King Jr., the leader of the march, delivered one of his most famous speeches, \"How Long, Not Long\".\n\"Radical Chic\".\nOn January 14, 1970, Bernstein and his wife Felicia held an event at their Manhattan apartment seeking to raise awareness and funds for the defense of members of the Black Panther Party, known as the Panther 21. \"The New York Times\" initially covered the gathering in its society section, but later published an editorial harshly unfavorable to Bernstein.\nThe story became widely publicized, climaxing in June of that year with the appearance of \"Radical Chic: That Party at Lenny's\", a cover story by journalist Tom Wolfe in \"New York Magazine\". The article led to the popularization of the pejorative term \"radical chic\". Bernstein and his wife Felicia received hate mail, and their building was picketed by Jewish Defense League protesters. Bernstein's FBI file later revealed that the Bureau had generated the letters, and had implanted agents to make the protests look more substantial.\nAnti-Vietnam war efforts.\nOn January 21, 1968, Bernstein and Paul Newman co-hosted \"Broadway for Peace\" at Lincoln Center's Philharmonic Hall to support the Congressional Peace Campaign Committee, which funded congressional campaigns opposing the Vietnam War. For the occasion, Bernstein composed a song, \"So Pretty\", sung by Barbra Streisand accompanied by Bernstein on the piano.\nOn January 19, 1973, Bernstein conducted members of the National Symphony Orchestra in a \"Concert of Peace\" at the Washington National Cathedral. The free performance of Haydn's \"Mass in Time of War\", which took place on the eve of the second inauguration of Richard Nixon, was in protest of Nixon's failure to bring an end to the Vietnam War.\nRostropovich and the Soviet Union.\nBernstein played a key role in the release of renowned cellist and conductor Mstislav Rostropovich from the USSR in 1974. Rostropovich, a strong believer in free speech and democracy, had been officially held in disgrace; his concerts and tours both at home and abroad cancelled; and in 1972 he was prohibited to travel outside of the Soviet Union. During a trip to the USSR in 1974, U.S. Senator from Massachusetts Ted Kennedy and his wife Joan, urged by Bernstein and others in the cultural sphere, mentioned Rostropovich's situation to Leonid Brezhnev, the Soviet Union Communist Party Leader. Two days later, Rostropovich was granted his exit visa.\nNuclear disarmament.\nBernstein was a committed and outspoken supporter of nuclear disarmament. In 1980, he gave a commencement speech at Johns Hopkins University warning the graduating class of the dangers of nuclear proliferation. In 1983, he dedicated the activities surrounding his 65th birthday to the issue of nuclear disarmament. In 1985, he brought the European Community Youth Orchestra on a \"Journey for Peace\" tour across Europe and Japan, performing at the Hiroshima Peace Ceremony to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the bombing.\nAdvocacy for AIDS research and patient care.\nIn the 1980s, Bernstein was frustrated that the Reagan Administration took so long to acknowledge the existence of the AIDS epidemic, let alone provide resources for research and patient care. Bernstein was galvanized to provide advocacy however he could. In a written statement for a June 1983 benefit for AIDS advocacy in Houston, Bernstein wrote: \"AIDS is not, repeat not, the Gay Plague it is so often made out to be; it is part of the human condition, and must be universally researched and annihilated.\"\nOn April 30, 1983, at Madison Square Garden in New York City, Bernstein participated in one of the earliest HIV / AIDS fundraisers, which raised over $250,000 for the Gay Men's Health Crisis (GMHC). Bernstein conducted the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus Orchestra with mezzo-soprano Shirley Verrett in \"The Star-Spangled Banner\".\nOn November 8, 1987, Bernstein participated in another event to benefit the Gay Men's Health Crisis. The concert at Carnegie Hall, \"Music for Life\", was dedicated to Dr. Mathilde Krim and her work at the American Foundation for AIDS Research (amFAR). Bernstein was joined by Leontyne Price, Marilyn Horne, Luciano Pavarotti, and Yo-Yo Ma, among others.\nOn November 15, 1989, Bernstein refused the National Medal of Arts from President George H. W. Bush in protest against the revoked National Endowment for the Arts grant for a New York exhibit of AIDS-related art.\nPhilanthropy.\nBernstein funded a variety of fellowships, funds, and scholarships including ones at the Tanglewood Music Center, Jacobs School of Music, Brandeis University, and the ASCAP Foundation. Several of these funds were named for his late wife Felicia Montealegre, including scholarships at the Juilliard School, Columbia University School of the Arts, New York University Tisch School of the Arts, and the Felicia Montealegre Bernstein Fund of Amnesty International USA.\nBernstein had a lifelong interest in integrating the arts into general education. When he won the Japan Art Association's Praemium Imperiale award in 1990, Bernstein used the $100,000 prize money to initiate a project in Nashville, Tennessee that would eventually lead to the current nationwide teaching model known as Artful Learning.\nInfluence and characteristics.\nAs a conductor.\nLeonard Bernstein was one of the most significant conductors of the 20th century. He was held in high regard by musicians around the world, including the members of the New York Philharmonic, which he led for eleven seasons; the Vienna Philharmonic, where he received an honorary membership; the Boston Symphony Orchestra, which he conducted principally at Tanglewood for over 50 years; the London Symphony Orchestra, of which he was president; and the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, where he appeared regularly as their guest conductor. Audiences worldwide eagerly anticipated Bernstein's performances, from New York to Tokyo to Caracas to Sydney.\nIn 1943, Bernstein's last-minute conducting debut in Carnegie Hall with the New York Philharmonic, which was broadcast live nationwide, caused him to become famous overnight. He soon became the first American-born, American-trained conductor to achieve international status, at a time when conductors traditionally came from Europe.\nBernstein's three major conducting mentors were Serge Koussevitzky, Dimitri Mitropoulos, and Fritz Reiner. Bernstein's conducting was characterized by his physically expressive podium manner. Orchestra members often remarked that Bernstein's every gesture conveyed a specific musical communication for them.\nBernstein performed a wide classical music repertoire from the Baroque era to the music of his time. Bernstein conducted and recorded definitive interpretations of works by traditional composers such as Haydn, Beethoven, Brahms, Schumann, and Tchaikovsky; championed music by lesser known composers such as Mahler, Sibelius, and Nielsen; and advocated modern composers such as Stravinsky, Hindemith, Shostakovich, and Ligeti. Bernstein programmed American composers everywhere in the world that he conducted, sharing the music of Gershwin, Copland, and Ives. He expanded the definitions of the genres that could be included in the concert hall by programming jazz, musical theater, and works from Latin America.\nA skilled pianist, he often conducted piano concertos from the keyboard, including works by Gershwin, Mozart, Beethoven, and Ravel.\nBernstein was also an influential conducting teacher and mentor. During his many years at Tanglewood, Schleswig-Holstein and elsewhere, Bernstein directly influenced many young conductors, including Seiji Ozawa, Claudio Abbado, Lorin Maazel, Marin Alsop, Michael Tilson Thomas, James DePreist, Edo de Waart, Eiji Oue, JoAnn Falletta, Yutaka Sado, Maurice Peress, Carl St. Clair, John Mauceri, Alexander Frey, and Jaap van Zweden.\nAs an educator.\nBernstein's impact as an educator stretched far beyond his music students. Through the medium of television, Bernstein introduced millions of viewers worldwide to symphonic music. His \"Young People's Concerts with the New York Philharmonic\" brought in younger viewers, while his \"Omnibus\", \"Ford Presents\", and \"Lincoln Presents\" brought musical concepts to general audiences.\nIn the 1950s, Bernstein taught at Brandeis University for several years, and founded their Festival of the Creative Arts, which the institution later named after him. Over the course of his career, Bernstein taught at numerous locations worldwide, including at the Tanglewood Institute, and founded three summer festivals of his own: Los Angeles Philharmonic Institute, Orchestral Academy of the Schleswig-Holstein Musik Festival, and the Pacific Music Festival.\nAs a composer.\nBernstein's music combined genres and musical styles. He wove together elements of classical, jazz, popular, Broadway, Latin, Jewish music, and more to create a musical fabric uniquely his own.\nBernstein's Jewish influences are clearly audible in both his symphonic and theatre works. Two of his symphonies, \"Symphony No. 1: \"Jeremiah\"\" and \"Symphony No. 3: \"Kaddish\"\", incorporated Hebrew texts and sources, as did his \"Chichester Psalms\", \"Hashkiveinu\", \"Four Sabras\", \"Halil\", and \"Dybbuk\". In two of his theatre works, \"Candide\" and \"West Side Story\", the call of the shofar can clearly be heard in the score. Bernstein occasionally turned to Christian sources as well, for example in his \"Missa Brevis\" and his theatre work \"MASS\".\nAmong the 20th century composers who influenced Bernstein were Aaron Copland, Igor Stravinsky, Maurice Ravel, George Gershwin, and Marc Blitzstein. Bernstein's score for \"West Side Story\" incorporated multiple elements from classical, Latin-Caribbean, and bebop jazz. While his music was rooted in tonality, many of his works incorporated 12-tone elements \u2013 from the atonal score of the ballet \"Dybbuk\" to his \"Symphony No. 3: \"Kaddish\"\".\nBernstein's Broadway shows \u2014 \"West Side Story\", \"On the Town\", \"Wonderful Town,\" and \"Candide\" \u2014 as well as his theatre piece \"MASS\" continue to be produced worldwide. In addition to his works for the stage, all three of his symphonies, his \"Serenade\", and his song cycles, including \"Songfest\" and \"Arias and Barcaroles\", are inspired by theatrical and literary sources. Bernstein himself said that virtually all his compositions \"could in some sense be thought of as 'theatre' pieces\".\nBernstein's keen sense of rhythm lent his compositions readily to use for ballet and other dance forms. In addition to his own ballets \u2014 \"Fancy Free\", \"Facsimile\", and \"Dybbuk\" \u2014 and musicals, many works were choreographed in his lifetime, as well as afterward, for both stage and film. Choreographers of Bernstein's music include Jerome Robbins, Alvin Ailey, John Neumeier, Alexei Ratmansky, Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker, Larry Keigwin, and Justin Peck.\nThe eclectic nature of Bernstein's music often generated criticism, particularly from the academic community of the mid-20th century where the Second Viennese School and its 12-tone approach held sway. Bernstein received additional criticism for his theatre work \"MASS\", which some members of the Catholic Church considered offensive. The work's thinly veiled antiwar stance was enough to prevent President Richard Nixon from attending the premiere at the 1971 opening of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. While his eclecticism, as well as his fearlessness in taking on social issues, generated controversy in his lifetime, Bernstein is now considered a hero and role model for the next generation of composers.\nDespite frequent criticism in his lifetime, Bernstein's music has endured into the 21st century and is regularly performed, discussed, and recorded around the world. In 2008\u201309, his 90th anniversary year, Bernstein was the second-most frequently performed American composer (behind Aaron Copland). In 2018, his centennial year, Bernstein was the third-most played composer worldwide for the year, alongside Beethoven, Mozart, Bach, and Brahms. That year, four of the five most-played concert works worldwide were Bernstein compositions: \"Symphonic Dances from West Side Story\", \"Overture to Candide\", \"Serenade (after Plato's Symposium)\", and \"Chichester Psalms\".\nAudio recordings.\nBetween 1945 and 1950, Bernstein recorded a variety of works for RCA Victor, primarily consisting of his own compositions and those of other American composers. During this time, he also recorded for Decca Records and Hargail Records. His recordings for Decca Records contains some \"musical analysis\" recordings in a form similar to his \"Young People's Concerts\".\nOn April 2, 1956, Bernstein signed his first long-term contract with Columbia Records regarding services as conductor, piano soloist, and as commentator. Between 1956 and 1979, Bernstein recorded over 500 compositions for Columbia, 455 of which were recorded with the New York Philharmonic. Bernstein's typical pattern of recording at that time was to record major works in the studio immediately following the orchestra's subscription concerts or on one of the \"Young People's Concerts.\" Any spare studio time that remained was used to record short orchestral showpieces and other works.\nIn 1990, Sony Classical acquired Columbia/CBS Records. Between 1992 and 1993, Sony reissued and digitally remastered Bernstein's complete Columbia catalog as part of a 100-volume, 125-CD \"Royal Edition\", featuring watercolors by Charles, Prince of Wales on the covers.\nBetween 1997 and 2001, Sony issued the \"Bernstein Century\" series, which was a combination of new re-releases and items from the \"Royal Edition\". The rights to Bernstein's RCA Victor recordings became owned by Sony following its 2008 acquisition of Bertelsmann Music Group (BMG). The complete Bernstein Columbia and RCA Victor catalog was reissued on CD in a three-volume series of box sets (released in 2010, 2014, and 2018, respectively) comprising a total of 198 discs under the mantle \"Leonard Bernstein Edition\".\nIn 1972, Bernstein made his first recording for Deutsche Grammophon: Bizet's \"Carmen\". On October 17, 1976, Bernstein made his first live recording on Deutsche Grammophon, leading to a 14-year collaboration until his death in 1990. The vast majority of the DG recordings were of live performances, which had become Bernstein's preferred approach to recording. From the 1970s onward, Bernstein's audio recordings were supplemented with films produced by Amberson Productions and Unitel, which were subsequently released on LaserDisc and DVD.\nBernstein recorded for other labels as well. Notable exceptions include recordings of Gustav Mahler's \"Song of the Earth\" and Mozart's 15th piano concerto and \"Linz\" symphony with the Vienna Philharmonic for Decca Records (1966); Berlioz's \"Symphonie fantastique\" and \"Harold en Italie\" (1976) for EMI; and Wagner's \"Tristan und Isolde\" (1981) for Philips Records. In total, Bernstein received 63 Grammy Award nominations and was awarded 16 Grammys in various categories, including for posthumously released recordings. He was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Grammy in 1985.\nAwards and honors.\nOver the course of his distinguished career, Bernstein has received seven Emmy Awards, two Tony Awards, and 16 Grammy Awards as well as a nomination for an Academy Award. Bernstein is also a member of both the American Theater Hall of Fame and the Television Hall of Fame. In 1998, Bernstein was inducted into the American Classical Music Hall of Fame.; in 2015, he was inducted into the Legacy Walk.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}

The protocol underlying this Java-only implementation is known as Java Remote Method Protocol (JRMP). In order to support code running in a non-JVM context, programmers later developed a CORBA version.\nUsage of the term RMI may denote solely the programming interface or may signify both the API and JRMP, IIOP, or another implementation, whereas the term RMI-IIOP (read: RMI over IIOP) specifically denotes the RMI interface delegating most of the functionality to the supporting CORBA implementation.\nThe basic idea of Java RMI, the distributed garbage-collection (DGC) protocol, and much of the architecture underlying the original Sun implementation, come from the \"network objects\" feature of Modula-3.\nGeneralized code.\nThe programmers of the original RMI API generalized the code somewhat to support different implementations, such as a HTTP transport. Additionally, the ability to pass arguments \"by value\" was added to CORBA in order to be compatible with the RMI interface. Still, the RMI-IIOP and JRMP implementations do not have fully identical interfaces.\nRMI functionality comes in the package , while most of Sun's implementation is located in the codice_1 package. Note that with Java versions before Java 5.0, developers had to compile RMI stubs in a separate compilation step using codice_2. Version 5.0 of Java and beyond no longer require this step - and static stubs have been deprecated since Java 8.\nJini version.\nJini offers a more advanced version of RMI in Java. It functions similarly but provides more advanced security, object discovery capabilities, and other mechanisms for distributed object applications.\nExample.\nThe following classes implement a simple client-server program using RMI that displays a message.\nimport java.rmi.Remote;\nimport java.rmi.RemoteException;\npublic interface RmiServerIntf extends Remote {\n String getMessage() throws RemoteException;\nimport java.rmi.Naming;\nimport java.rmi.RemoteException;\nimport java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject;\nimport java.rmi.registry.*;\npublic class RmiServer extends UnicastRemoteObject implements RmiServerIntf {\n public static final String MESSAGE = \"Hello World\";\n public RmiServer() throws RemoteException {\n super(0); // required to avoid the 'rmic' step, see below\n public String getMessage() {\n return MESSAGE;\n public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\n System.out.println(\"RMI server started\");\n try { //special exception handler for registry creation\n LocateRegistry.createRegistry(1099);\n System.out.println(\"java RMI registry created.\");\n } catch (RemoteException e) {\n //do nothing, error means registry already exists\n System.out.println(\"java RMI registry already exists.\");\n \n //Instantiate RmiServer\n RmiServer server = new RmiServer();\n // Bind this object instance to the name \"RmiServer\"\n Naming.rebind(\"//localhost/RmiServer\", server);\n System.out.println(\"PeerServer bound in registry\");\nimport java.rmi.Naming;\npublic class RmiClient {\n public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\n RmiServerIntf server = (RmiServerIntf)Naming.lookup(\"//localhost/RmiServer\");\n System.out.println(server.getMessage());\nBefore running this example, we need to make a 'stub' file for the interface we used. For this task we have the RMI compiler - 'rmic'\n rmic RmiServer\nNote that since version 5.0 of J2SE, support for dynamically generated stub files has been added, and rmic is only provided for backwards compatibility with earlier runtimes, or for programs that don't provide an explicit port number (or zero) when exporting remote objects, which is required for generated stubs to be possible, as described in the Javadoc for .

{"id": "43285", "revid": "45433808", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43285", "title": "Common Object Request Broker Architecture", "text": "Standard to facilitate communication between systems on diverse platforms\nThe Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) is a standard defined by the Object Management Group (OMG) designed to facilitate the communication of systems that are deployed on diverse platforms. CORBA enables collaboration between systems on different operating systems, programming languages, and computing hardware. CORBA uses an object-oriented model although the systems that use the CORBA do not have to be object-oriented. CORBA is an example of the distributed object paradigm.\nWhile briefly popular in the mid to late 1990s, CORBA's complexity, inconsistency, and high licensing costs have relegated it to being a niche technology.\nOverview.\nCORBA enables communication between software written in different languages and running on different computers. Implementation details from specific operating systems, programming languages, and hardware platforms are all removed from the responsibility of developers who use CORBA. CORBA normalizes the method-call semantics between application objects residing either in the same address-space (application) or in remote address-spaces (same host, or remote host on a network). Version 1.0 was released in October 1991.\nCORBA uses an interface definition language (IDL) to specify the interfaces that objects present to the outer world. CORBA then specifies a \"mapping\" from IDL to a specific implementation language like C++ or Java. Standard mappings exist for Ada, C, C++, C++11, COBOL, Java, Lisp, PL/I, Object Pascal, Python, Ruby, and Smalltalk. Non-standard mappings exist for C#, Erlang, Perl, Tcl, and Visual Basic implemented by object request brokers (ORBs) written for those languages. Versions of IDL have changed significantly with annotations replacing some pragmas.\nThe CORBA specification dictates there shall be an ORB through which an application would interact with other objects. This is how it is implemented in practice:\nSome IDL mappings are more difficult to use than others. For example, due to the nature of Java, the IDL-Java mapping is rather straightforward and makes usage of CORBA very simple in a Java application. This is also true of the IDL to Python mapping. The C++ mapping requires the programmer to learn datatypes that predate the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). By contrast, the C++11 mapping is easier to use, but requires heavy use of the STL. Since the C language is not object-oriented, the IDL to C mapping requires a C programmer to manually emulate object-oriented features.\nIn order to build a system that uses or implements a CORBA-based distributed object interface, a developer must either obtain or write the IDL code that defines the object-oriented interface to the logic the system will use or implement. Typically, an ORB implementation includes a tool called an IDL compiler that translates the IDL interface into the target language for use in that part of the system. A traditional compiler then compiles the generated code to create the linkable-object files for use in the application. This diagram illustrates how the generated code is used within the CORBA infrastructure:\nThis figure illustrates the high-level paradigm for remote interprocess communications using CORBA. The CORBA specification further addresses data typing, exceptions, network protocols, communication timeouts, etc. For example: Normally the server side has the Portable Object Adapter (POA) that redirects calls either to the local servants or (to balance the load) to the other servers. The CORBA specification (and thus this figure) leaves various aspects of distributed system to the application to define including object lifetimes (although reference counting semantics are available to applications), redundancy/fail-over, memory management, dynamic load balancing, and application-oriented models such as the separation between display/data/control semantics (e.g. see Model\u2013view\u2013controller), etc.\nIn addition to providing users with a language and a platform-neutral remote procedure call (RPC) specification, CORBA defines commonly needed services such as transactions and security, events, time, and other domain-specific interface models.\nVersions history.\nThis table presents the history of CORBA standard versions.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\nNote that IDL changes have progressed with annotations (e.g. @unit, @topic) replacing some pragmas.\nServants.\nA servant is the invocation target containing methods for handling the remote method invocations. In the newer CORBA versions, the remote object (on the server side) is split into the object \"(that is exposed to remote invocations)\" and servant \"(to which the former part forwards the method calls)\". It can be one \"servant\" per remote \"object\", or the same servant can support several (possibly all) objects, associated with the given Portable Object Adapter. The \"servant\" for each \"object\" can be set or found \"once and forever\" (servant activation) or dynamically chosen each time the method on that object is invoked (servant location). Both servant locator and servant activator can forward the calls to another server. In total, this system provides a very powerful means to balance the load, distributing requests between several machines. In the object-oriented languages, both remote \"object\" and its \"servant\" are objects from the viewpoint of the object-oriented programming.\n\"Incarnation\" is the act of associating a servant with a CORBA object so that it may service requests. Incarnation provides a concrete servant form for the virtual CORBA object. Activation and deactivation refer only to CORBA objects, while the terms incarnation and etherealization refer to servants. However, the lifetimes of objects and servants are independent. You always incarnate a servant before calling activate_object(), but the reverse is also possible, create_reference() activates an object without incarnating a servant, and servant incarnation is later done on demand with a Servant Manager.\nThe \"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Portable Object Adapter\" (POA) is the CORBA object responsible for splitting the server side remote invocation handler into the remote \"object\" and its \"servant\". The object is exposed for the remote invocations, while the servant contains the methods that are actually handling the requests. The servant for each object can be chosen either statically (once) or dynamically (for each remote invocation), in both cases allowing the call forwarding to another server.\nOn the server side, the POAs form a tree-like structure, where each POA is responsible for one or more objects being served. The branches of this tree can be independently activated/deactivated, have the different code for the servant location or activation and the different request handling policies.\nFeatures.\nThe following describes some of the most significant ways that CORBA can be used to facilitate communication among distributed objects.\nObjects By Reference.\nThis reference is either acquired through a stringified Uniform Resource Locator (URL), NameService lookup (similar to Domain Name System (DNS)), or passed-in as a method parameter during a call.\nObject references are lightweight objects matching the interface of the real object (remote or local). Method calls on the reference result in subsequent calls to the ORB and blocking on the thread while waiting for a reply, success, or failure. The parameters, return data (if any), and exception data are marshaled internally by the ORB according to the local language and OS mapping.\nData By Value.\nThe CORBA Interface Definition Language provides the language- and OS-neutral inter-object communication definition. CORBA Objects are passed by reference, while data (integers, doubles, structs, enums, etc.) are passed by value. The combination of Objects-by-reference and data-by-value provides the means to enforce great data typing while compiling clients and servers, yet preserve the flexibility inherent in the CORBA problem-space.\nObjects By Value (OBV).\nApart from remote objects, the CORBA and RMI-IIOP define the concept of the OBV and Valuetypes. The code inside the methods of Valuetype objects is executed locally by default. If the OBV has been received from the remote side, the needed code must be either \"a priori\" known for both sides or dynamically downloaded from the sender. To make this possible, the record, defining OBV, contains the Code Base that is a space-separated list of URLs whence this code should be downloaded. The OBV can also have the remote methods.\nCORBA Component Model (CCM).\nCORBA Component Model (CCM) is an addition to the family of CORBA definitions. It was introduced with CORBA 3 and it describes a standard application framework for CORBA components. Though not dependent on \"language dependent Enterprise Java Beans (EJB)\", it is a more general form of EJB, providing four component types instead of the two that EJB defines. It provides an abstraction of entities that can provide and accept services through well-defined named interfaces called \"ports\".\nThe CCM has a component container, where software components can be deployed. The container offers a set of services that the components can use. These services include (but are not limited to) notification, authentication, persistence, and transaction processing. These are the most-used services any distributed system requires, and, by moving the implementation of these services from the software components to the component container, the complexity of the components is dramatically reduced.\nPortable interceptors.\nPortable interceptors are the \"hooks\", used by CORBA and RMI-IIOP to mediate the most important functions of the CORBA system. The CORBA standard defines the following types of interceptors:\nThe interceptors can attach the specific information to the messages being sent and IORs being created. This information can be later read by the corresponding interceptor on the remote side. Interceptors can also throw forwarding exceptions, redirecting request to another target.\nGeneral InterORB Protocol (GIOP).\nThe GIOP is an abstract protocol by which Object request brokers (ORBs) communicate. Standards associated with the protocol are maintained by the Object Management Group (OMG). The GIOP architecture provides several concrete protocols, including:\nVMCID (Vendor Minor Codeset ID).\nEach standard CORBA exception includes a minor code to designate the subcategory of the exception. Minor exception codes are of type unsigned long and consist of a 20-bit \"Vendor Minor Codeset ID\" (VMCID), which occupies the high order 20 bits, and the minor code proper which occupies the low order 12 bits.\nMinor codes for the standard exceptions are prefaced by the VMCID assigned to OMG, defined as the unsigned long constant CORBA::OMGVMCID, which has the VMCID allocated to OMG occupying the high order 20 bits. The minor exception codes associated with the standard exceptions that are found in Table 3\u201313 on page 3-58 are or-ed with OMGVMCID to get the minor code value that is returned in the ex_body structure.\nWithin a vendor assigned space, the assignment of values to minor codes is left to the vendor.\nThe VMCID 0 and 0xfffff are reserved for experimental use. The VMCID OMGVMCID and 1 through 0xf are reserved for OMG use.\nCorba Location (CorbaLoc).\nCorba Location (CorbaLoc) refers to a stringified object reference for a CORBA object that looks similar to a URL.\nAll CORBA products must support two OMG-defined URLs: \"corbaloc:\" and \"corbaname:\". The purpose of these is to provide a human readable and editable way to specify a location where an IOR can be obtained.\nAn example of corbaloc is shown below:\n corbaloc::160.45.110.41:38693/StandardNS/NameServer-POA/_root\nA CORBA product may optionally support the \"http:\", \"ftp:\", and \"file:\" formats. The semantics of these is that they provide details of how to download a stringified IOR (or, recursively, download another URL that will eventually provide a stringified IOR). Some ORBs do deliver additional formats which are proprietary for that ORB.\nBenefits.\nCORBA's benefits include language- and OS-independence, freedom from technology-linked implementations, strong data-typing, high level of tunability, and freedom from the details of distributed data transfers.\nLanguage independence.\nCORBA was designed to free engineers from limitations of coupling their designs to a particular software language. Currently there are many languages supported by various CORBA providers, the most popular being Java and C++. There are also C++11, C-only, Smalltalk, Perl, Ada, Ruby, and Python implementations, just to mention a few.\nHistorically, Java supported CORBA as part of its standard library, in package codice_1. These have since been deprecated in Java 9 and removed in Java 11.\nOS-independence.\nCORBA's design is meant to be OS-independent. CORBA is available in Java (OS-independent), as well as natively for Linux/Unix, Windows, Solaris, OS X, OpenVMS, HPUX, Android, LynxOS, VxWorks, ThreadX, INTEGRITY, and others.\nFreedom from technologies.\nOne of the main implicit benefits is that CORBA provides a neutral playing field for engineers to be able to normalize the interfaces between various new and legacy systems. When integrating C, C++, Object Pascal, Java, Fortran, Python, and any other language or OS into a single cohesive system design model, CORBA provides the means to level the field and allow disparate teams to develop systems and unit tests that can later be joined into a whole system. This does not rule out the need for basic system engineering decisions, such as threading, timing, object lifetime, etc. These issues are part of any system regardless of technology. CORBA allows system elements to be normalized into a single cohesive system model.\nFor example, the design of a multitier architecture is made simple using Java Servlets in the web server and various CORBA servers containing the business logic and wrapping the database accesses. This allows the implementations of the business logic to change, while the interface changes would need to be handled as in any other technology. For example, a database wrapped by a server can have its database schema change for the sake of improved disk usage or performance (or even whole-scale database vendor change), without affecting the external interfaces. At the same time, C++ legacy code can talk to C/Fortran legacy code and Java database code, and can provide data to a web interface.\nData-typing.\nCORBA provides flexible data typing, for example an \"ANY\" datatype. CORBA also enforces tightly coupled data typing, reducing human errors. In a situation where Name-Value pairs are passed around, it is conceivable that a server provides a number where a string was expected. CORBA Interface Definition Language provides the mechanism to ensure that user-code conforms to method-names, return-, parameter-types, and exceptions.\nHigh tunability.\nMany implementations (e.g. ORBexpress (Ada, C++, and Java implementation) and OmniORB (open source C++ and Python implementation)) have options for tuning the threading and connection management features. Not all ORB implementations provide the same features.\nFreedom from data-transfer details.\nWhen handling low-level connection and threading, CORBA provides a high level of detail in error conditions. This is defined in the CORBA-defined standard exception set and the implementation-specific extended exception set. Through the exceptions, the application can determine if a call failed for reasons such as \"Small problem, so try again\", \"The server is dead\", or \"The reference does not make sense.\" The general rule is: Not receiving an exception means that the method call completed successfully. This is a very powerful design feature.\nCompression.\nCORBA marshals its data in a binary form and supports compression. IONA, Remedy IT, and Telef\u00f3nica have worked on an extension to the CORBA standard that delivers compression. This extension is called ZIOP and this is now a formal OMG standard.\nProblems and criticism.\nWhile CORBA delivered much in the way code was written and software constructed, it has been the subject of criticism.\nMuch of the criticism of CORBA stems from poor implementations of the standard and not deficiencies of the standard itself. Some of the failures of the standard itself were due to the process by which the CORBA specification was created and the compromises inherent in the politics and business of writing a common standard sourced by many competing implementors.\nInitial implementation incompatibilities.\nThe initial specifications of CORBA defined only the IDL, not the on-the-wire format. This meant that source-code compatibility was the best that was available for several years. With CORBA 2 and later this issue was resolved.\nLocation transparency.\nCORBA's notion of location transparency has been criticized; that is, that objects residing in the same address space and accessible with a simple function call are treated the same as objects residing elsewhere (different processes on the same machine, or different machines). This is a fundamental design flaw, as it makes all object access as complex as the most complex case (i.e., remote network call with a wide class of failures that are not possible in local calls). It also hides the inescapable differences between the two classes, making it impossible for applications to select an appropriate use strategy (that is, a call with latency and guaranteed return will be used very differently from a call with latency with possible transport failure, in which the delivery status is potentially unknown and might take to time out).\nDesign and process deficiencies.\nThe creation of the CORBA standard is also often cited for its process of design by committee. There was no process to arbitrate between conflicting proposals or to decide on the hierarchy of problems to tackle. Thus the standard was created by taking a union of the features in all proposals with no regard to their coherence. This made the specification complex, expensive to implement entirely, and often ambiguous.\nA design committee composed of a mixture of implementation vendors and customers created a diverse set of interests. This diversity made difficult a cohesive standard. Standards and interoperability increased competition and eased customers' movement between alternative implementations. This led to much political fighting within the committee and frequent releases of revisions of the CORBA standard that some ORB implementors ensured were difficult to use without proprietary extensions. Less ethical CORBA vendors encouraged customer lock-in and achieved strong short-term results. Over time the ORB vendors that encourage portability took over market share. \nProblems with implementations.\nThrough its history, CORBA has been plagued by shortcomings in poor ORB implementations. Unfortunately many of the papers criticizing CORBA as a standard are simply criticisms of a particularly bad CORBA ORB implementation.\nCORBA is a comprehensive standard with many features. Few implementations attempt to implement all of the specifications, and initial implementations were incomplete or inadequate. As there were no requirements to provide a reference implementation, members were free to propose features which were never tested for usefulness or implementability. Implementations were further hindered by the general tendency of the standard to be verbose, and the common practice of compromising by adopting the sum of all submitted proposals, which often created APIs that were incoherent and difficult to use, even if the individual proposals were perfectly reasonable.\nRobust implementations of CORBA have been very difficult to acquire in the past, but are now much easier to find. The SUN Java SDK comes with CORBA built-in. Some poorly designed implementations have been found to be complex, slow, incompatible, and incomplete. Robust commercial versions began to appear but for significant cost. As good quality free implementations became available the bad commercial implementations died quickly.\nFirewalls.\nCORBA (more precisely, GIOP) is not tied to any particular communications transport. A specialization of GIOP is the Internet Inter-ORB Protocol or IIOP. IIOP uses raw TCP/IP connections in order to transmit data.\nIf the client is behind a very restrictive firewall or transparent proxy server environment that only allows HTTP connections to the outside through port 80, communication may be impossible, unless the proxy server in question allows the HTTP CONNECT method or SOCKS connections as well. At one time, it was difficult even to force implementations to use a single standard port \u2013 they tended to pick multiple random ports instead. As of today, current ORBs do have these deficiencies. Due to such difficulties, some users have made increasing use of web services instead of CORBA. These communicate using XML/SOAP via port 80, which is normally left open or filtered through a HTTP proxy inside the organization, for web browsing via HTTP. Recent CORBA implementations, though, support SSL and can be easily configured to work on a single port. Some ORBS, such as TAO, omniORB, and JacORB also support bidirectional GIOP, which gives CORBA the advantage of being able to use callback communication rather than the polling approach characteristic of web service implementations. Also, most modern firewalls support GIOP &amp; IIOP and are thus CORBA-friendly firewalls.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
