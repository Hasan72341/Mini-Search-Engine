Her work also encompasses performance art and filmmaking.\nOno grew up in Tokyo and moved to New York City in 1952 to join her family. She became involved with New York City's downtown artists scene in the early 1960s, which included the Fluxus group, and became widely known outside the fine art world in 1969 when she married English musician John Lennon of the Beatles, with whom she would subsequently record as a duo in the Plastic Ono Band. The couple used their honeymoon as a stage for public protests against the Vietnam War with what they called a bed-in. She and Lennon remained married until he was murdered in front of the couple's apartment building, The Dakota, on December 8, 1980. Together, they had one son, Sean, who later also became a musician.\nOno began a career in popular music in 1969, forming the Plastic Ono Band with Lennon and producing a number of avant-garde music albums in the 1970s. She achieved commercial and critical success in 1980 with the chart-topping album \"Double Fantasy\", a collaboration with Lennon that was released three weeks before his murder, winning the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. To date, she has had twelve number one singles on the US Dance charts, and in 2016 was named the 11th most successful dance club artist of all time by \"Billboard\" magazine. Many musicians have paid tribute to Ono as an artist in her own right and as a muse and icon, including Elvis Costello who recorded his version of \"Walking on Thin Ice\" with the Attractions for the \"Every Man Has a Woman\" tribute album to Yoko Ono, the B-52's, Sonic Youth and Meredith Monk.\nAs Lennon's widow, Ono works to preserve his legacy. She funded the Strawberry Fields memorial in Manhattan's Central Park, the Imagine Peace Tower in Iceland, and the John Lennon Museum in Saitama, Japan (which closed in 2010). She has made significant philanthropic contributions to the arts, peace and disaster relief in Japan and the Philippines, and other such causes. In 2002, she inaugurated a biennial $50,000 LennonOno Grant for Peace. In 2012, she received the Dr. Rainer Hildebrandt Human Rights Award and co-founded the group Artists Against Fracking.\nBiography.\nEarly life and family.\nOno was born in Tokyo on February 18, 1933, to mother (1911\u20131999) and father , a wealthy banker and former classical pianist. Isoko's adoptive maternal grandfather was an affiliate of the Yasuda clan and zaibatsu. Yoko's maternal uncle by marriage to Isoko's sister Sumako was the diplomat Toshikazu Kase, who was present as an English speaking diplomat, at the signing ceremony of the Japanese surrender thereby ending WWII.\nEisuke came from a long line of samurai warrior-scholars. The kanji translation of \"Y\u014dko\" () means \"ocean child\". Two weeks before Ono's birth, Eisuke was transferred to San Francisco, California, US by his employer, the Yokohama Specie Bank. The rest of the family followed soon after, with Ono first meeting her father when she was two years old. Her younger brother Keisuke was born in December 1936.\nIn 1937, the family was transferred back to Japan, and Ono enrolled at Tokyo's elite Gakush\u016bin (also known as the Peers School), one of the most exclusive schools in Japan. Ono was enrolled in piano lessons from the age of 4, until the age of 12 or 13. She attended kabuki performances with her mother, who was trained in shamisen, koto, otsuzumi, kotsuzumi, nagauta, and could read Japanese musical scores.\nThe family moved to New York City in 1940. The next year, Eisuke was transferred from New York City to Hanoi in French Indochina, and the family returned to Japan. Ono was enrolled in Keimei Gakuen, an exclusive Christian primary school run by the Mitsui family. She remained in Tokyo throughout World War II and the fire-bombing of March 9, 1945, during which she was sheltered with other family members in a special bunker in Tokyo's Azabu district, away from the heavy bombing. Ono later went to the Karuizawa mountain resort with members of her family.\nStarvation was rampant in the destruction that followed the Tokyo bombings. Ono said it was during this period in her life that she developed her \"aggressive\" attitude. Stories tell of her mother bringing a large number of goods to the countryside, where they were bartered for food. In one anecdote, her mother traded a German-made sewing machine for of rice to feed the family. During this time, Ono's father, who had been in Hanoi, was believed to be in a prisoner of war camp in China. Ono told Amy Goodman of \"Democracy Now!\" on October 16, 2007, that \"He was in French Indochina, which is Vietnam actually... in Saigon. He was in a concentration camp.\"\nAfter the war ended in 1945, Ono remained in Japan when her family moved to the United States and settled in Scarsdale, New York, an affluent town north of midtown Manhattan. By April 1946, Gakush\u016bin was reopened and Ono re-enrolled. The school, located near the Tokyo Imperial Palace, had not been damaged by the war, and Ono found herself a classmate of Prince Akihito, the future emperor of Japan. At 14 years old, she took up vocal training in lieder-singing.\nCollege and downtown beginnings.\nOno graduated from Gakush\u016bin in 1951 and was accepted into the philosophy program of Gakushuin University as the first woman to enter the department. However, she left the school after two semesters.\nOno joined her family in New York in September 1952, enrolling at nearby Sarah Lawrence College. Ono's parents approved of her college choice, but disapproved of her lifestyle and chastised her for befriending people they felt were beneath her. In 1956, Ono left college to elope with Japanese composer Toshi Ichiyanagi, a star in Tokyo's experimental community, then studying at Juilliard.\nAt Sarah Lawrence, Ono studied poetry with Alastair Reid, English literature with Kathryn Mansell, and music composition with the Viennese-trained Andr\u00e9 Singer. Ono has said that her heroes at this time were the twelve-tone composers Arnold Schoenberg and Alban Berg. She said, \"I was just fascinated with what they could do. I wrote some twelve-tone songs, then my music went into [an] area that my teacher felt was really a bit off track, and... he said, 'Well, look, there are people who are doing things like what you do, and they're called avant-garde.'\" Singer introduced her to the work of Edgar Var\u00e8se, John Cage, and Henry Cowell. Ono left college and moved to New York in 1957, supporting herself through secretarial work and lessons in the traditional Japanese arts at the Japan Society.\nOno has often been associated with the Fluxus group, a loose association of Dada-inspired avant-garde artists which was founded in the early 1960s by Lithuanian-American artist George Maciunas. Maciunas promoted her work, giving Ono her first solo exhibition at his AG Gallery in New York in 1961. He formally invited Ono to join Fluxus, but she declined because she wanted to remain independent. However, she did collaborate with Maciunas, Charlotte Moorman, George Brecht, and the poet Jackson Mac Low, among others associated with the group.\nOno first met John Cage through his student Ichiyanagi Toshi, in Cage's experimental composition class at the New School for Social Research. She was introduced to more of Cage's unconventional neo-Dadaism first hand, and via his New York City prot\u00e9g\u00e9s Allan Kaprow, Brecht, Mac Low, Al Hansen and the poet Dick Higgins.\nAfter Cage finished teaching at the New School in the summer of 1960, Ono was determined to rent a place to present her works along with the work of other avant-garde artists in the city. She eventually found an inexpensive loft in downtown Manhattan at 112 Chambers Street and used the apartment as a studio and living space, also allowing composer La Monte Young to organize concerts in the loft. They both held a series of events there from December 1960 through June 1961; the events were attended by people such as Marcel Duchamp and Peggy Guggenheim. Ono and Young both claimed to have been the primary curator of these events, with Ono claiming to have been eventually pushed into a subsidiary role by Young. Ono presented work only once during the series.\nIn 1961, Ono had her first major public performance in a concert at the 258-seat Carnegie Recital Hall (smaller than the \"Main Hall\"). This concert featured radical experimental music and performances.\nThe Chambers Street series hosted some of Ono's earliest conceptual artwork, including \"Painting to Be Stepped On\", a scrap of canvas on the floor that became a completed artwork as footprints were left on it. With that work, Ono suggested that a work of art no longer needed to be mounted on a wall and inaccessible. She showed this work and other instructional work again at Macunias's AG Gallery in July 1961. After Ono set a painting on fire at one performance, Cage advised her to treat the paper with flame retardant. She is credited for the album cover art for the album \"Nirvana Symphony\" by Toshiro Mayuzumi, released by Time Records in 1962.\nAfter living apart for several years, Ono and Ichiyanagi filed for divorce in 1962. Ono returned home to live with her parents, and, suffering from clinical depression, was briefly placed into a Japanese mental institution.\nEarly career and motherhood.\nOn November 28, 1962, Ono married Anthony Cox, an American film producer and art promoter who had been instrumental in securing her release from the mental institution. Ono's second marriage was annulled on March 1, 1963, because she had neglected to finalize her divorce from Ichiyanagi. After finalizing that divorce, Cox and Ono married again on June 6, 1963. She gave birth to their daughter Kyoko Chan Cox two months later, on August 8, 1963.\nThe marriage quickly fell apart, but the couple continued working together for the sake of their joint careers. They performed at Tokyo's Sogetsu Hall, with Ono lying atop a piano played by John Cage. Soon, the couple returned to New York with Kyoko. In the early years of the marriage, Ono left most of Kyoko's parenting to Cox while she pursued her art full-time, with Cox also managing her publicity.\nOno had a second engagement at the Carnegie Recital Hall in 1965, in which she debuted \"Cut Piece\". In September 1966, Ono visited London to meet artist and political activist Gustav Metzger's Destruction in Art Symposium in September 1966. She was the only woman artist chosen to perform her own events and only one of two invited to speak. She premiered \"The Fog Machine\" during her \"Concert of Music for the Mind\" at the Bluecoat Society of Arts in Liverpool, England in 1967.\nOno and Cox divorced on February 2, 1969, and she married John Lennon later that same year. During a 1971 custody battle, Cox disappeared with their eight-year-old daughter. He won custody after successfully claiming that Ono was an unfit mother due to her drug use. Ono's ex-husband changed Kyoko's name to \"Ruth Holman\" and subsequently raised the girl in an organization known as the Church of the Living Word. Ono and Lennon searched for Kyoko for years, but to no avail. She would finally see Kyoko again in 1998.\nRelationship with John Lennon.\nOno's first contact with any member of the Beatles occurred when she visited Paul McCartney at his home in London to obtain a Lennon\u2013McCartney song manuscript for a book John Cage was working on, \"Notations\". McCartney declined to give her any of his manuscripts but suggested that Lennon might oblige. Lennon later gave Ono the original handwritten lyrics to \"The Word\".\nOno and Lennon first met on November 7, 1966, at the Indica Gallery in London, where she was preparing \"Unfinished Paintings\", her conceptual art exhibit about interactive painting and sculpture. They were introduced by gallery owner John Dunbar. One piece, \"Ceiling Painting/Yes Painting\", had a ladder painted white with a magnifying glass at the top. When Lennon climbed the ladder, he looked through the magnifying glass and was able to read the word \"YES\" which was written in miniature. He greatly enjoyed this experience as it was a positive message, whereas most concept art he encountered at the time was anti-everything.\nLennon was also intrigued by Ono's \"Hammer a Nail\" where viewers were invited to hammer a nail into a wooden board painted white. Although the exhibition had not yet opened, Lennon wanted to hammer a nail into the clean board, but Ono stopped him. Dunbar asked her, \"Don't you know who this is? He's a millionaire! He might buy it.\" Ono feigned not knowing of the Beatles (even as she had gone to see Paul McCartney asking for a Beatle song score), but relented on the condition that Lennon pay her five shillings, to which Lennon replied, \"I'll give you an imaginary five shillings and hammer an imaginary nail in.\"\nIn a 2002 interview, Ono said, \"I was very attracted to him. It was a really strange situation.\" Ono started writing to Lennon, sending him her conceptual artworks, and soon the two began corresponding. In September 1967, Lennon sponsored Ono's solo \"Half-A-Wind Show\", at Lisson Gallery in London. When Lennon's wife Cynthia asked for an explanation of why Ono was telephoning them at home, he told her that Ono was only trying to obtain money for her \"avant-garde bullshit\".\nIn early 1968, while the Beatles were making their visit to India, Lennon wrote the song \"Julia\" and included a reference to Ono: \"Ocean child calls me\", referring to the translation of Yoko's Japanese spelling. In May 1968, while his wife was on holiday in Greece, Lennon invited Ono to visit. They spent the night recording a selection of avant-garde tape loops, after which, he said, they \"made love at dawn\". The recordings made by the two during this session ultimately became their first collaborative album, the musique concrete work \"\". When Lennon's wife returned home, she found Ono wearing her bathrobe and drinking tea with Lennon, who simply said, \"Oh, hi.\"\nOn September 24 and 25, 1968, Lennon wrote and recorded \"Happiness Is a Warm Gun\", which contains sexual references to Ono. Ono became pregnant, but had a miscarriage of a male child on November 21, 1968, a few weeks after Lennon's divorce from Cynthia was granted. On December 12, 1968, Lennon and Ono participated in the BBC documentary about The Rolling Stones, \"The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus\", along with several other high-profile musicians. Lennon performed his Beatles composition \"Yer Blues\" towards the end, with an improvised vocal performance by Ono rounding out the set. The film would not be released until 1996, due to the death of The Rolling Stones' founding member Brian Jones a few months after it was shot.\nEarly collaborations, marriage and \"bed-ins\".\nDuring the final two years of the Beatles, Lennon and Ono created and attended public protests against the Vietnam War. They collaborated on a series of avant-garde recordings, beginning in 1968 with \"\", which notoriously featured an unretouched image of the two artists nude on the front cover. The same year, the couple contributed an experimental sound collage to The Beatles' self-titled \"White Album\" called \"Revolution 9\", with Ono contributing additional vocals to \"Birthday\", and one lead vocal line on \"The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill\", marking the only occasion in a Beatles recording in which a woman sings lead vocals.\nOn March 20, 1969, Lennon and Ono were married at the registry office in Gibraltar and spent their honeymoon in Amsterdam, campaigning with a week-long bed-in for peace. They planned another bed-in in the US, but were denied entry to the country. They held one instead at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal, where they recorded \"Give Peace a Chance\". Lennon later stated his regrets about feeling \"guilty enough to give McCartney credit as co-writer on my first independent single instead of giving it to Yoko, who had actually written it with me.\" The couple often combined advocacy with performance art, such as in \"bagism\", first introduced during a Vienna press conference, where they satirised prejudice and stereotyping by wearing a bag over their entire bodies. Lennon detailed this period in the Beatles' song \"The Ballad of John and Yoko\".\nDuring the Amsterdam Bed-In press conference, Yoko also earned controversy in the Jewish community for saying during the press conference that, \"If I was a Jewish girl in Hitler's day, I would approach him and become his girlfriend. After 10 days in bed, he would come to my way of thinking. This world needs communication. And making love is a great way of communicating.\"\nLennon changed his name by deed poll on April 22, 1969, switching out \"Winston\" for \"Ono\" as a middle name. Although he used the name John Ono Lennon after that, official documents referred to him as John Winston Ono Lennon. The couple settled at Tittenhurst Park at Sunninghill, Berkshire, in southeast England. When Ono was injured in a car crash, Lennon arranged for a king-sized bed to be brought to the recording studio as he worked on the Beatles' last recorded album, \"Abbey Road\".\nThe Plastic Ono Band.\nAfter \"The Ballad of John and Yoko\", Lennon and Ono decided it would be better to form their own band to release their newer, more personally representative art work, rather than release the sound material as the Beatles. To this end they formed the Plastic Ono Band, a name based on their 1968 Fluxus conceptual art project of the same name. Plastic Ono Band was first conceived of by Ono in 1967 as an idea for an art exhibition in Berlin but the Plastic Ono Band was first physically realized in 1968 as a multi-media machine maquette by John Lennon, also called \"The Plastic Ono Band\". In 1968, Lennon and Ono began a personal and artistic relationship in which they decided to credit their future endeavours as work of the Plastic Ono Band. Under that name Ono and Lennon collaborated on several art exhibitions, concerts, happenings and experimental noise music recording projects, including a sound and light installation in the Apple press office that consisted of four perspex columns, each representing a member of the Beatles, with one holding a tape recorder and amplifier, the second a closed-circuit TV and camera, the third a record player and amplifier, and the fourth a miniature light show and loud speaker. Soon after the Plastic Ono Band name was used in recording and releasing somewhat more standard rock-based albums.\nIn July 1969, Lennon's first solo single, \"Give Peace a Chance\" (backed by Ono's \"Remember Love\") was the first release to be credited to the Plastic Ono Band. It was followed in October by \"Cold Turkey\" (backed by Ono's \"Don't Worry Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking for Her Hand in the Snow)\"). The singles were followed in December by the group's first album, \"Live Peace in Toronto 1969\", which had been recorded live at the Toronto Rock and Roll Revival festival in September. This incarnation of the group also consisted of guitarist Eric Clapton, bass player Klaus Voormann, and drummer Alan White. The first half of their performance consisted of rock standards. During the second half, Ono took to the microphone and performed two original feedback-driven compositions, \"Don't Worry Kyoko\" and \"John John (Let's Hope for Peace)\", constituting the entirety of the second half of the live album.\n\"Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band\" and \"Fly\".\nOno released her first solo album, \"Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band\" in 1970, as a companion piece to Lennon's \"John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band\". The two albums also had companion covers: Ono's featured a photo of her leaning on Lennon, and Lennon's a photo of him leaning on Ono. Her album included raw, harsh vocals, which bore a similarity with sounds in nature (especially those made by animals) and free jazz techniques used by wind and brass players. Performers included Ornette Coleman, other renowned free jazz performers, and Ringo Starr. Some songs on the album consisted of wordless vocalizations, in a style that would influence Meredith Monk and other musical artists who have used screams and vocal noise instead of words. The album reached No. 182 on the US charts.\nWhen Lennon was invited to play with Frank Zappa at the Fillmore (then the Filmore West) on June 5, 1971, Ono joined them. Later that year, she released \"Fly\", a double album. In it, she explored slightly more conventional psychedelic rock with tracks including \"Midsummer New York\" and \"Mind Train\", in addition to a number of Fluxus experiments. She also received minor airplay with the ballad \"Mrs. Lennon\". The track \"Don't Worry, Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking for Her Hand in the Snow)\" was an ode to Ono's missing daughter, and featured Eric Clapton on guitar. In 1971, while studying with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in Mallorca, Spain, Ono's ex-husband Anthony Cox accused Ono of abducting their daughter Kyoko from the kindergarten. They reached an out-of-court agreement and the charges were dismissed. Cox eventually moved away with Kyoko. Ono would not see her daughter until 1998. During this time, she wrote \"Don't Worry Kyoko\", which also appears on Lennon and Ono's album \"Live Peace in Toronto 1969\", in addition to \"Fly\". Kyoko is also referenced in the first line of \"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\" when Yoko whispers \"Happy Christmas, Kyoko\", followed by Lennon whispering, \"Happy Christmas, Julian.\" The song reached No. 4 in the UK, where its release was delayed until 1972, and has periodically reemerged on the UK Singles Chart. Originally a protest song about the Vietnam War, \"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\" has since become a Christmas standard. That August the couple appeared together at a benefit in Madison Square Garden with Roberta Flack, Stevie Wonder, and Sha Na Na for mentally disabled children organized by WABC-TV's Geraldo Rivera.\nIn a 2018 issue of \"Portland Magazine\", editor Colin W. Sargent writes of interviewing Yoko while she was visiting Portland, Maine, in 2005. She spoke of driving along the coast with Lennon and dreamed of buying a house in Maine. \"We talked excitedly in the car. We were looking for a house on the water\u2026 We did examine the place! We kept driving north along the water until I don't really remember the name of the town. We went quite a ways up, actually, because it was so beautiful.\"\nIn 1973, Ono recorded a single, \"Joseijoi Banzai, Parts 1 and 2\" with musicians billed as the Plastic Ono Band and Elephants Memory and released it only in Japan. She cheered feminism by combining lyrics inspired by Japanese war songs with Pop rhythms, signalling a new direction.\nSeparation and reconciliation.\nAfter the Beatles disbanded in 1970, Ono and Lennon lived together in London and then moved permanently to Manhattan to escape tabloid racism towards Ono. Their relationship became strained because Lennon was facing deportation due to drug charges that had been filed against him in England, and because of Ono's separation from her daughter. The couple separated in July 1973, with Ono pursuing her career and Lennon living between Los Angeles and New York with personal assistant May Pang; Ono had given her blessing to Lennon and Pang's relationship.\nBy December 1974, Lennon and Pang considered buying a house together, and he refused to accept Ono's phone calls. The next month, Lennon agreed to meet Ono, who claimed to have found a cure for smoking. After the meeting, Lennon failed to return home or call Pang. When she telephoned the next day, Ono told her Lennon was unavailable, because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment with Pang; he was stupefied and confused to such an extent that Pang believed he had been brainwashed. He told her his separation from Ono was now over, though Ono would allow him to continue seeing her as his mistress, which did not happen.\nOno and Lennon's son, Sean, was born on October 9, 1975, Lennon's 35th birthday. Following the birth of Sean, both Lennon and Ono took a hiatus from the music industry, with Lennon becoming a stay-at-home dad to care for his infant son. Sean has followed in his parents' footsteps with a career in music; he performs solo work, works with Ono and formed bands as, The Ghost of a Saber Tooth Tiger and The Claypool Lennon Delirium.\nReturn to music and murder of Lennon.\nIn early 1980, Lennon heard Lene Lovich and the B-52's' \"Rock Lobster\" while on vacation in Bermuda. The latter reminded him of Ono's musical sound and he took this as an indication that she had reached the mainstream (the band had in fact been influenced by Ono). Ono and Lennon began trading songs over the phone with each other, quickly accumulating enough material to record. The emerging album was structured as a dialogue, and was to be credited to John Lennon and Yoko Ono as a duo. It would also mark the return of Lennon to the public eye after a five-year absence, as well as a public reconciliation of Ono and Lennon.\n\"Double Fantasy\" was released on November 17, 1980, and received tepid initial reviews, with much of the criticism centering on the idealization of Lennon and Ono's marriage and supposed domestic bliss. However, the reception and the legacy of the album would be forever linked with what happened just weeks after its release.\nOn the evening of December 8, 1980, Lennon and Ono were at the Record Plant Studio and working on Ono's song \"Walking on Thin Ice\". When they returned to their Manhattan home The Dakota, Lennon was shot dead by Mark David Chapman, who had been stalking Lennon for two months. Yoko cradled the dying Lennon in her arms, and for a time afterward, lived in constant fear of her own and her son Sean's assassination.\nAfter John's death, the interior decorator Sam Havadtoy moved in to support her. \"Walking on Thin Ice (For John)\" was released as a single less than a month later, and became Ono's first chart success as a solo artist, peaking at No. 58 and gaining significant underground airplay. \"Double Fantasy\" received an instant critical reappraisal, eventually becoming a landmark album of the 1980s, and winning Ono the 1981 Grammy Award for Album of the Year at the 24th Annual Grammy Awards.\nIn 1981, she released the album \"Season of Glass\", which featured the striking cover photo of Lennon's bloody spectacles next to a half-filled glass of water, with a window overlooking Central Park in the background. This photograph sold at an auction in London in April 2002 for about $13,000. In the liner notes to \"Season of Glass\", Ono explained that the album was not dedicated to Lennon because \"he would have been offended\u2014he was one of us.\" The album received highly favorable reviews and reflected the public's mood after Lennon's assassination.\nIn 1982, she released \"It's Alright\". The cover featured Ono in her wrap-around sunglasses, looking towards the sun, while on the back the ghost of Lennon looks over her and their son. The album scored minor chart success and airplay with the single \"Never Say Goodbye\".\nIn 1984, a tribute album titled \"Every Man Has a Woman\" was released, featuring a selection of songs written by Ono performed by artists such as Elvis Costello, Roberta Flack, Eddie Money, Rosanne Cash, and Harry Nilsson. Later that year, Ono and Lennon's final album, \"Milk and Honey\", was released as a mixture of unfinished Lennon recordings from the \"Double Fantasy\" sessions, and new Ono recordings. It peaked at No. 3 in the UK and No. 11 in the U.S., going gold in both countries as well as in Canada.\nOno funded the construction and maintenance of the Strawberry Fields memorial in Manhattan's Central Park, directly across from the Dakota, which was the scene of the murder. It was officially dedicated on October 9, 1985, which would have been his 45th birthday.\nOno's final album of the 1980s was \"Starpeace\", a concept album that she intended as an antidote to Ronald Reagan's \"Star Wars\" missile defense system. On the cover, a warm, smiling Ono holds the Earth in the palm of her hand. \"Starpeace\" became Ono's most successful non-Lennon effort. The single \"Hell in Paradise\" was a hit, reaching No. 16 on the US dance charts and No. 26 on the Billboard Hot 100, and the video, directed by Zbigniew Rybczy\u0144ski received major airplay on MTV and won \"Most Innovative Video\" at Billboard Music Video Awards in 1986.\nIn 1986, Ono set out on a goodwill world tour for \"Starpeace\", primarily visiting Eastern European countries.\nResurgence and collaborations.\nIn 1990, Ono collaborated with music consultant Jeff Pollack to honor what would have been Lennon's 50th birthday with a worldwide broadcast of \"Imagine\". Over 1,000 stations in over 50 countries participated in the simultaneous broadcast. Ono felt the timing was perfect, considering the escalating conflicts in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Germany.\nOno went on a musical hiatus following the release of \"Starpeace\", until she signed with Rykodisc in 1992 and released the comprehensive six-disc box set \"Onobox\". The box set included remastered highlights from Ono's solo albums and previously unreleased material from the 1974 \"lost weekend\" sessions. She also released a one-disc sampler of highlights from \"Onobox\", simply titled \"Walking on Thin Ice\". That year, she sat down for an extensive interview with music journalist Mark Kemp for a cover story in the alternative music magazine \"Option\". The story took a revisionist look at Ono's music for a new generation of fans more accepting of her role as a pioneer in the blending of pop and avant-garde music.\nIn 1994, Ono produced her own off-Broadway musical entitled \"New York Rock\", which featured Broadway renditions of her songs.\nIn 1995, Ono released \"Rising\", a collaboration with her son Sean and his then-band, Ima. \"Rising\" spawned a world tour that traveled through Europe, Japan, and the United States. The following year, she collaborated with various alternative rock musicians for an EP entitled \"Rising Mixes\". Guest remixers of \"Rising\" material included Cibo Matto, Ween, Tricky, and Thurston Moore.\nIn 1997, Rykodisc reissued Ono's catalog of solo recordings on CD, from \"Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band\" through \"Starpeace\". Ono and her engineer Rob Stevens personally remastered the audio, and various bonus tracks were added, including outtakes, demos, and live cuts. In the same year, Ono and the BMI Foundation established an annual music competition program for songwriters of contemporary musical genres to honor John Lennon's memory and his large creative legacy. Over $350,000 has been given through BMI Foundation's John Lennon Scholarships to talented young musicians in the United States, making it one of the most respected awards for emerging songwriters.\nIn 2000, Ono founded the John Lennon Museum in Saitama, Japan, which housed over 130 pieces of Lennon and Beatles memorabilia from Ono's private collection. The museum closed in 2010.\nOno's feminist concept album \"Blueprint for a Sunrise\" was released in 2001. A month after the 9/11 attacks, Ono organized the concert \"Come Together: A Night for John Lennon's Words and Music\" at Radio City Music Hall. Hosted by the actor Kevin Spacey and featuring Lou Reed, Cyndi Lauper and Nelly Furtado, it raised money for September 11 relief efforts and aired on TNT and the WB.\nLater life and dance chart hits.\nIn 2002, Ono joined the B-52's in New York for their 25th anniversary concerts; she came out for the encore and performed \"Rock Lobster\" with the band. In March 2002, she was present with Cherie Blair at the unveiling of a seven-foot statue of Lennon to mark the renaming of Liverpool airport to Liverpool John Lennon Airport.\nBeginning in 2003, some DJs remixed other Ono songs for dance clubs. For the remix project, she dropped her first name and became known simply as \"ONO\", in response to the \"Oh, no!\" jokes that dogged her throughout her career. Ono had great success with new versions of \"Walking on Thin Ice\", remixed by top DJs and dance artists including Pet Shop Boys, Orange Factory, Peter Rauhofer, and Danny Tenaglia. In April 2003, Ono's \"Walking on Thin Ice (Remixes)\" was rated number 1 on Billboard's Dance/Club Play chart, gaining Ono her first no. 1 hit. She would have a second no. 1 hit on the same chart in November 2004 with \"Everyman... Everywoman...\", a reworking of her song \"Every Man Has a Woman Who Loves Him\".\nDuring the Liverpool Biennial in 2004, Ono flooded the city with two images on banners, bags, stickers, postcards, flyers, posters and badges: one of a woman's naked breast, the other of the same model's vulva. During her stay in Lennon's city of birth, she said she was \"astounded\" by the city's renaissance. The piece, titled \"My Mummy Was Beautiful\", was dedicated to Lennon's mother, Julia, who had died when he was a teenager. According to Ono, the work was meant to be innocent, not shocking; she was attempting to replicate the experience of a baby looking up at its mother's body, those parts of the mother's body being a child's introduction to humanity.\nOno performed at the opening ceremony for the 2006 Winter Olympic Games in Turin, Italy, Like many of the other performers during the ceremony, she wore white to symbolize the snow of winter. She read a free verse poem calling for world peace as an introduction to Peter Gabriel's performance of \"Imagine\".\nOn December 13, 2006, one of Ono's bodyguards was arrested after he was allegedly taped trying to extort $2\u00a0million from her. The tapes revealed that he threatened to release private conversations and photographs. His bail was revoked, and he pleaded not guilty to two counts of attempted grand larceny. On February 16, 2007, a deal was reached where extortion charges were dropped, and he pleaded guilty to attempted grand larceny in the third degree, a felony, and was sentenced to the 60 days that he had already spent in jail. After reading an unapologetic statement, he was released to immigration officials because he had also been found guilty of overstaying his business visa.\nOno released the album \"Yes, I'm a Witch\" in February 2007, a collection of remixes and covers from her back catalog by various artists including The Flaming Lips, Cat Power, Anohni, DJ Spooky, Porcupine Tree, and Peaches, along with a special edition of \"Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band\". \"Yes I'm a Witch\" was critically well received. A similar compilation of Ono dance remixes entitled \"Open Your Box\" was also released in April.\nOn June 26, 2007, Ono appeared on \"Larry King Live\" along with McCartney, Starr and Olivia Harrison. She headlined the Pitchfork Music Festival in Chicago on July 14, 2007, performing a full set that mixed music and performance art. She sang \"Mulberry\", a song about her time in the countryside after the Japanese collapse in World War II for only the third time ever, with Thurston Moore: She had previously performed the song with John and with Sean. On October 9 of that year, the Imagine Peace Tower on Vi\u00f0ey Island in Iceland, dedicated to peace and to Lennon, was turned on with her, Sean, Ringo, and Olivia in attendance. Each year between October 9 and December 8, it projects a vertical beam of light into the sky.\nOno returned to Liverpool for the 2008 Liverpool Biennial, where she unveiled \"Sky Ladders\" in the ruins of Church of St Luke (which was largely destroyed during World War II and now stands roofless as a memorial to those killed in the Liverpool Blitz). Two years later, on March 31, 2009, she went to the inauguration of the exhibition \"Imagine: The Peace Ballad of John &amp; Yoko\" to mark the 40th anniversary of the Lennon-Ono Bed-In at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal, Canada, from May 26 to June 2, 1969. The hotel had been doing steady business with the room they stayed in for over 40 years. That year Ono became a grandmother when Emi was born to her daughter Kyoko.\nOno had further Dance/Club Play chart no. 1 hits with \"No No No\" in January 2008, and \"Give Peace a Chance\" the following August. In June 2009, at the age of 76, Ono scored her fifth no. 1 hit on the Dance/Club Play chart with \"I'm Not Getting Enough\".\nIn May 2009, she designed a T-shirt for the second Fashion Against AIDS campaign and collection of HIV/AIDS awareness, NGO Designers Against AIDS, and H&amp;M, with the statement \"Imagine Peace\" depicted in 21 languages. Ono appeared onstage at Microsoft's June 1, 2009, E3 Expo press conference with Olivia Harrison, Paul McCartney, and Ringo Starr to promote the video game, which was universally praised by critics. Ono appeared on the Basement Jaxx album \"Scars\", featuring on the single \"Day of the Sunflowers (We March On)\". In the same year, she became an honorary patron to Alder Hey Charity, and created an exhibit called \"John Lennon: The New York City Years\" for the NYC Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Annex. The exhibit used music, photographs, and personal items to depict Lennon's life in New York. A portion of the cost of each ticket was donated to Spirit Foundation, a charitable foundation set up and founded by Lennon and Ono.\nThe new Plastic Ono Band.\nIn 2009, Ono recorded \"Between My Head and the Sky\", which was her first album to be released as \"Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band\" since 1973's \"Feeling the Space\". The all-new Plastic Ono Band lineup included Sean Lennon, Cornelius, and Yuka Honda. On February 16, 2010, Sean organized a concert at the Brooklyn Academy of Music called \"We Are Plastic Ono Band\", at which Yoko performed her music with Sean, Clapton, Klaus Voormann and Jim Keltner for the first time since the 1970s. Guests including Bette Midler, Paul Simon and his son Harper, and principal members of Sonic Youth and the Scissor Sisters interpreted her songs in their own styles.\nOn April 1, 2010, she was named the first \"Global Autism Ambassador\" by the Autism Speaks organization. She had created an artwork the year before for autism awareness and allowed it to be auctioned off in 67 parts to benefit the organization. In April 2010, RCRD LBL made available free downloads of Junior Boys' mix of \"Give Me Something\", a single originally released 10 years prior on \"Blueprint for a Sunrise\". That song and \"Wouldnit (I'm a Star)\", released September 14, made it to Billboard's end of the year list of favorite Dance/Club songs at No. 23 and No. 50 respectively.\nOno appeared with Starr on July 7 at New York's Radio City Music Hall in celebration of Starr's 70th birthday, performing \"With a Little Help from My Friends\" and \"Give Peace a Chance\". On September 16, she and Sean attended the opening of Julian Lennon's photo exhibition at the Morrison Hotel in New York City, appearing for the first time photos with Cynthia and Julian. She also promoted his work on her website. On October 1 and 2, Sean was musical director for two subsequent shows at the Orpheum Theater in Los Angeles, featuring Yoko Ono Plastic Ono Band with Perry Farrell, Cornelius, Carrie Fisher, Vincent Gallo, Yuka Honda, Haruomi Hosono, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, RZA, Harper Simon, Tune-Yards, Nels Cline, Iggy Pop, Mike Watt, Lady Gaga, Kim Gordon and Thurston Moore. She performed 'It's Getting Very Hard' with Lady Gaga, whom she deeply admires.\nOn February 18, 2011 (her 78th birthday), Ono took out a full-page advert in the UK free newspaper \"Metro\" for \"Imagine Peace 2011\". It took the form of an open letter, inviting people to think of, and wish for, peace. With son Sean, she held a benefit concert to aid in the relief efforts for earthquake and tsunami-ravaged Japan on March 27 in New York City. The effort raised a total of $33,000. The same year, \"Move on Fast\" became her sixth consecutive number-one hit on the \"Billboard\" Hot Dance Club Songs chart and her eighth number-one hit overall. She also collaborated with The Flaming Lips on an EP entitled \"The Flaming Lips with Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band\".\nIn July 2011, she visited Japan to support earthquake and tsunami victims and tourism to the country. During her visit, Ono gave a lecture and performance entitled \"The Road of Hope\" at Tokyo's Mori Art Museum, during which she painted a large calligraphy piece entitled \"Dream\" to help raise funds for construction of the Rainbow House, an institution for the orphans of the Great East Japan earthquake. She also collected the 8th Hiroshima Art Prize for her contributions to art and for peace, that she was awarded the year prior.\nIn January 2012, a Ralphi Rosario mix of her 1995 song \"Talking to the Universe\" became her seventh consecutive No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart. In March of the same year, she was awarded the 20,000-euro ($26,400) Oskar Kokoschka Prize in Austria. From June 19 to September 9, her work \"To the Light\" was exhibited at the Serpentine Gallery in London. It was held in conjunction with the London 2012 Festival, a 12-week UK-wide celebration featuring internationally renowned artists from Midsummer's Day (June 21) to the final day of the Paralympic Games on September 9. The album \"Yokokimthurston\" was also released in 2012, featuring a collaboration with Thurston Moore and Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth. AllMusic characterized it as \"focused and risk-taking\" and \"above the best\" of the couple's experimental music, with Ono's voice described as \"one-of-a-kind\".\nOn June 29, 2012, Ono received a lifetime achievement award at the Dublin Biennial. During this (her second) trip to Ireland (the first was with John before they married), she visited the crypt of Irish leader Daniel O'Connell at Glasnevin Cemetery and D\u00fan Laoghaire, from where Irish people departed for England to escape the famine. In February 2013, Ono accepted the Rainer Hildebrandt Medal at Berlin's Checkpoint Charlie Museum, awarded to her and Lennon for their lifetime of work for peace and human rights. The next month, she tweeted an anti-gun message with the \"Season of Glass\" image of Lennon's bloodied glasses on what would have been her and Lennon's 44th anniversary, noting that guns have killed more than 1 million people since Lennon's death in 1980. She was also given a Congressional citation from the Philippines for her monetary aid to the victims of typhoon Pablo, as well as her donation to disaster relief efforts after typhoon Ondoy in 2009 and assistance of Filipino schoolchildren.\nIn 2013, she and the Plastic Ono Band released the LP \"Take Me to the Land of Hell\", which featured numerous guests including Yuka Honda, Cornelius, Hirotaka \"Shimmy\" Shimizu, mi-gu's Yuko Araki, Wilco's Nels Cline, Tune-Yards, Questlove, Lenny Kravitz, and Ad-Rock and Mike D of the Beastie Boys. In June 2013, she curated the Meltdown festival in London, where she played two concerts, one with the Plastic Ono Band, and the second on backing vocals during Siouxsie Sioux's rendition of \"Walking on Thin Ice\" at the \"Double Fantasy\" show. In July, OR Books published Ono's sequel to 1964's \"Grapefruit\", another book of instruction-based 'action poems' this time entitled, \"Acorn\".\nHer online video for \"Bad Singer\" released in November 2013, which featured some of these guests, was well-liked by the press. By the end of the year she had become one of three artists with two songs in the Top 20 Dance/Club and had two consecutive number 1 hits on Billboard's Hot Dance Club Play Charts. On the strength of the singles \"Hold Me\" (Featuring Dave Aud\u00e9) and \"Walking on Thin Ice\", the then-80-year-old beat Katy Perry, Robin Thicke and her friend Lady Gaga.\nIn 2014, \"Angel\" was Ono's twelfth number one on the US Dance chart. Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band continued to perform live into 2015.\nOn February 16, 2016, Manimal Vinyl released \"Yes, I'm a Witch Too,\" which features remixes from Moby, Death Cab For Cutie, Sparks, and Miike Snow. Like its predecessor, \"Yes, I'm a Witch Too\" received critical acclaim. On February 26, 2016, Ono was hospitalized after suffering what was rumored to be a possible stroke. It was later announced that she was experiencing extreme symptoms of the flu. On September 6, 2016, Secretly Canadian announced that they would be re-issuing 11 of Ono's albums from 1968 to 1985; \"Unfinished Music No. 1: Two Virgins\" through \"Starpeace\". In December 2016, \"Billboard magazine\" named her the 11th most successful dance club artist of all time.\nIn October 2018, Ono released \"Warzone\", which included new versions of previously recorded tracks including \"Imagine\".\nIn a piece for the \"New Yorker\" published in November 2021, it was noted that Ono had \"withdrawn from public life\", with her son Sean now acting as the public representative for the family's interests in the Beatles' business.\nArtwork.\n\"Instructions for Paintings\", 1961\u201362.\nA conceptual artwork of 22 instructions for paintings, handwritten in Japanese by Ono's then-husband, the avant-garde composer Toshi Ichiyanagi. There were no associated paintings, just a set of written instructions to create the paintings.\n\"Cut Piece\", 1964.\nOno was a pioneer of conceptual art and performance art. A seminal performance work is \"Cut Piece\", first performed in 1964 at the Yamaichi Concert Hall in Kyoto, Japan. The piece consisted of Ono, dressed in her best suit, kneeling on a stage with a pair of scissors in front of her. She invited and then instructed audience members to join her on stage and cut pieces of her clothing off. Confronting issues of gender, class and cultural identity, Ono sat silently until the piece concluded at her discretion. The piece was subsequently performed at the Sogetsu Art Centre in Tokyo that same year, New York's Carnegie Hall in 1965 and London's Africa Center as part of the Destruction in Art Symposium in 1966. Of the piece, Jon Hendricks wrote in the catalogue to Ono's Japan Society retrospective: \"[\"Cut Piece\"] unveils the interpersonal alienation that characterizes social relationships between subjects, dismantling the disinterested Kantian aesthetic model... It demonstrates the reciprocity between artists, objects, and viewers and the responsibility beholders have to the reception and preservation of art.\"\nOther performers of the piece have included Charlotte Moorman and Jon Hendricks. Ono reprised the piece in Paris in 2003, in the low post-9/11 period between the US and France, saying she hoped to show that this is \"a time where [sic] we need to trust each other\". In 2013, the Canadian singer Peaches reprised it at the multi-day Meltdown festival at the Southbank Centre in London, which Ono curated.\n\"Grapefruit\" book, 1964.\nOno's small book titled \"Grapefruit\" is another seminal piece of conceptual art. First published in 1964, the book reads as a set of instructions through which the work of art is completed-either literally or in the imagination of the viewer participant. One example is \"Hide and Seek Piece: Hide until everybody goes home. Hide until everybody forgets about you. Hide until everybody dies.\" \"Grapefruit\" has been published several times, most widely distributed by Simon &amp; Schuster in 1971, who reprinted it again in 2000. David Bourdon, art critic for \"The Village Voice\" and \"Vogue\", called \"Grapefruit\" \"one of the monuments of conceptual art of the early 1960s\". He noted that her conceptual approach was made more acceptable when white male artists like Joseph Kosuth and Lawrence Weiner came in and \"did virtually the same things\" she did, and that her take also has a poetic and lyrical side that sets it apart from the work of other conceptual artists.\nOno would enact many of the book's scenarios as performance pieces throughout her career, which formed the basis for her art exhibitions, including the highly publicized retrospective exhibition, \"This Is Not Here\" in 1971 at the Everson Museum in Syracuse, New York, that was nearly closed when it was besieged by excited Beatles fans, who broke several of the art pieces and flooded the toilets. It was her last major exhibition until 1989's \"\" retrospective at the Whitney Museum in New York.\nNearly fifty years later, in July 2013, she released a sequel to \"Grapefruit\", another book of instructions, \"Acorn\" via OR Books.\n\"Ceiling Painting/Yes Painting\", 1966.\nThe work was shown at Ono's autumn 1966 exhibition, \"Unfinished Paintings and Objects By Yoko Ono\" at the Indica Gallery in London, and viewed during the preview night by John Lennon.\nDo It Yourself Fluxfest, 1966.\nA 20-piece collection conjoining short instructional texts by Ono with Maciunas' graphic illustrations. First printed in \"3 newspaper events for the price of $1\", the No. 7, February 1966 issue of the Fluxus magazine cc V TRE, the compilation underscores the Fluxus idea that anyone can make art. These amusing pieces find meaning in the humorous dialogue that exists between Ono's instructions and Maciunas' skillful treatment of text with relation to pictorial motifs.\nExperimental films, 1964\u20131972.\nOno was also an experimental filmmaker who made 16 films between 1964 and 1972, gaining particular renown for a 1966 Fluxus film called simply \"No. 4\", often referred to as \"Bottoms\". The 80-minute film consists of a series of close-ups of human buttocks walking on a treadmill. The screen is divided into four almost equal sections by the elements of the gluteal cleft and the horizontal gluteal crease. The soundtrack consists of interviews with those who are being filmed, as well as those considering joining the project. In 1996, the watch manufacturing company Swatch produced a limited edition watch that commemorated this film. She also collaborated with Lennon on the film \"Fly\" (1970), the soundtrack of which appeared on her 1971 album \"Fly\"; and on \"Up Your Legs Forever\", a quasi-sequel to \"No. 4\".\nIn March 2004, the ICA London, showed most of her films from this period in their exhibition \"The Rare Films of Yoko Ono\". She also acted in an obscure exploitation film in 1965, \"Satan's Bed\".\n\"Wish Tree\", 1996\u2013present.\nAnother example of Ono's participatory art was her \"Wish Tree\" project, in which a tree native to the installation site is installed. Her 1996 \"Wish Piece\" had the following instructions:\nMake a wish\nWrite it down on a piece of paper\nFold it and tie it around a branch of a Wish Tree\nAsk your friends to do the same\nKeep wishing\nUntil the branches are covered with wishes.\nHer \"Wish Tree\" installation in the Sculpture Garden of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, established in July 2010, has attracted contributions from all over the world. Other installation locations include London; St. Louis; Washington, D.C.; San Francisco; Copenhagen; the Stanford University campus in Palo Alto, California; Japan; Venice; Dublin; and, Miami at the Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden in 2010.\nIn 2014 Ono's \"Imagine Peace\" exhibit opened at the Bob Rauschenburg Gallery at Florida SouthWestern State College in Fort Myers, Florida. Ono installed a billboard on U.S. Route 41 in Fort Myers to promote the show and peace. When the exhibit closed, wishes that had been placed on the installed Wish Trees were sent to the Imagine Peace Tower in Iceland and added to the millions of wishes already there. \"Imagine Peace\" was also installed in Houston in 2011 through the Deborah Colton Gallery, returning in 2016.\n\"Earth Peace\", 2014.\nOne of two pieces Ono installed as part of the 2014 Folkestone Triennial, Earth Peace originally consisted of many parts and appeared in many locations and media around Folkestone, including posters, stickers, billboards and badges. Three of the pieces remain in Folkestone, on loan to the town and part of the Creative Folkestone Artworks collection. These include an inscribed stone, a flag \u2013 which is flown on an annual basis on International Peace Day and a beacon of light installed on the dome roof of The Grand in Folkestone Leas. Ono's beacon flashes a morse code message, \"Earth Peace\", across the English Channel.\n\"Skyladder\", 2014.\nThe second of Ono's 2014 Folkestone Triennial pieces and now also on loan to the town as part of the Folkestone Artworks collection, \"Skyladder\" is displayed in two locations \u2013 on a high wall of the Quarterhouse bar and in the staircase of the Folkestone public library. \"Skyladder\" takes the form of an artistic 'instruction' or invitation to the people of Folkestone and beyond. The instruction reads: \"Audience should bring a ladder they like. Colour it. Word it. Take pictures of it. Keep adding things to it. And send it as a postcard to a friend\"\".\"\n\"Arising\", 2015.\nIn 2015, Ono created the piece \"Arising\" in Venice. As part of the exhibition \"Personal Structures\", organised by Global Art Affairs, the installation was on view from June 1 through November 24, 2013, at the European Cultural Centre's Palazzo Bembo. In this feminist work of art, female silicon bodies were burnt in the Venetian lagoon, evoking the imagery of mythical phoenixes. When asked for the resemblance between the naming of her record \"Rising\" and this piece, Ono responded: \"\"Rising\" was telling all people that it is time for us to rise and fight for our rights. But in the process of fighting together, women are still being treated separately in an inhuman way. It weakens the power of men and women all together. I hope \"Arising\" will wake up Women Power, and make us, men and women, heal together.\"\n\"Skylanding\", 2016.\nIn October 2016, Ono unveiled her first permanent art installation in the United States; the collection is located in Jackson Park, Chicago and promotes peace. Ono was inspired during a visit to the Garden of the Phoenix in 2013 and feels a connection to the city of Chicago.\n\"Refugee Boat\", 2019.\nParticipating in Lower Manhattan's River to River Festival in 2019, Ono presented her participatory installation \"Add Color (Refugee Boat)\" (1960/2019). The work comprises a white room with a white rowing boat in it, which were both covered by messages and drawings from members of the audience throughout the festival. Through the participatory nature of the work, the artist emphasised the need for solidarity and the history of immigrants and refugees in the United States. \"Refugee Boat\" belongs to Ono's \"Add Color Painting\" series, first enacted in 1960, which invites the audience to make marks over the designated objects, often white.\n\"DREAM TOGETHER,\" 2020.\nIn 2020, Yoko Ono created DREAM TOGETHER, for the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\u00a0 It was the first time the Museum had displayed art on its fa\u00e7ade (usually reserved for banners). It was meant to convey a \"powerful message of hope and unity\" during the COVID-19 crisis. The artwork consisted of black text on two white banners with \"DREAM\" on the south banner and \"TOGETHER\" on the north banner.\nRecognition and retrospectives.\nJohn Lennon once described his wife as \"the world's most famous unknown artist: everybody knows her name, but nobody knows what she does\". Her circle of friends in the New York art world has included Kate Millett, Nam June Paik, Dan Richter, Jonas Mekas, Merce Cunningham, Judith Malina, Erica Abeel, Fred DeAsis, Peggy Guggenheim, Betty Rollin, Shusaku Arakawa, Adrian Morris, Stefan Wolpe, Keith Haring, and Andy Warhol (she was one of the speakers at Warhol's 1987 funeral), as well as George Maciunas and La Monte Young. In addition to Mekas, Maciunas, Young, and Warhol, she has also collaborated with DeAsis, Yvonne Rainer and Zbigniew Rybczy\u0144ski.\nIn 1989, the Whitney Museum held a retrospective of her work, \"Yoko Ono: Objects, Films\", marking Ono's reentry into the New York art world after a hiatus. At the suggestion of Ono's live-in companion at the time, interior decorator Sam Havadtoy, she recast her old pieces in bronze after some initial reluctance. \"I realized that for something to move me so much that I would cry, there's something there. There seemed like a shimmering air in the 60s when I made these pieces, and now the air is bronzified. Now it's the 80s, and bronze is very 80s in a way \u2013 solidity, commodity, all of that. For someone who went through the 60s revolution, there has of course been an incredible change. . . . I call the pieces petrified bronze. That freedom, all the hope and wishes are in some ways petrified.\"\nOver a decade later, in 2001, \"Y E S YOKO ONO\", a 40-year retrospective of Ono's work, received the International Association of Art Critics USA Award for Best Museum Show Originating in New York City, considered one of the highest accolades in the museum profession. YES refers to the title of a 1966 sculptural work by Yoko Ono, shown at Indica Gallery, London: viewers climb a ladder to read the word \"yes\", printed on a small canvas suspended from the ceiling. The exhibition's curator Alexandra Munroe wrote that \"John Lennon got it, on his first meeting with Yoko: when he climbed the ladder to peer at the framed paper on the ceiling, he encountered the tiny word YES. 'So it was positive. I felt relieved.'\" The exhibition traveled to 13 museums in the U.S., Canada, Japan, and Korea from 2000 through 2003. In 2001, she received an honorary Doctorate of Laws from Liverpool University and, in 2002, was presented with the honorary degree of Doctor of Fine Arts from Bard College\nand the Skowhegan Medal for work in assorted media. The next year, she was awarded the fifth MOCA Award to Distinguished Women in the Arts from the Museum of Contemporary Art Los Angeles. In 2005, she received a lifetime achievement award from the Japan Society of New York, which had hosted \"Yes Yoko Ono\" and where she had worked in the late 1950s and early 1960s.\nIn 2008, she showed a large retrospective exhibition, \"Between The Sky and My Head\", at the Kunsthalle Bielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany, and the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art in Gateshead, England. The following year, she showed a selection of new and old work as part of her show \"Anton's Memory\" in Venice, Italy. She also received a Golden Lion Award for lifetime achievement from the Venice Biennale in 2009. In 2012, Ono held a major exhibition of her work \"To The Light\" at the Serpentine Galleries, London. She was also the winner of the 2012 Oskar Kokoschka Prize, Austria's highest award for applied contemporary art. In February 2013, to coincide with her 80th birthday, the largest retrospective of her work, \"Half-a-Wind Show\", opened at the Schirn Kunsthalle Frankfurt\nand travelled to Denmark's Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, Austria's Kunsthalle Krems, and Spain's Guggenheim Museum Bilbao.\nIn 2014 she contributed several artworks to the triennial Folkestone art festival. In 2015 the Museum of Modern Art in New York City held a retrospective exhibition of her early work, \"Yoko Ono: One Woman Show, 1960\u2013 1971\". In 2015, Yoko Ono received the European Cultural Centre Art Award for her continuing efforts to promote \"Imagine Peace\".\nIn 2024, the Tate Modern, London, in collaboration with Gropius Bau, Berlin, and Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen, D\u00fcsseldorf organized a retrospective exhibition titled \"Yoko Ono:\" \"Music of the Mind.\" The exhibition reprised participatory works such as \"Cut Piece\" (1964) and \"Add Color (Refugee Boat).\" It was exhibited at the Tate Modern (15 February\u20131 September 2024), Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen, D\u00fcsseldorf (28 September 2024 \u2013 16 March 2025), Gropius Bau (11 April\u201331 August 2025) and the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago (18 October 2025 \u2013 22 February 2026). The catalog was edited by Juliet Bingham, Connor Monahan and Jon Hendricks.\u00a0 \nIn 2025, the Neue Nationalgalerie, Berlin held an exhibition both her artwork and music.\nPolitical activism, social media and public appreciation.\nOno has been an activist for peace and human rights since the 1960s. After she and Lennon married in Gibraltar, they held a March 1969 \"Bed-in for Peace\" in their honeymoon suite at the Amsterdam Hilton Hotel. The newlyweds were eager to talk about and promote world peace; they wore pajamas and invited visitors and members of the press. Two months later, Ono and Lennon held another Bed-in at the Queen Elizabeth Fairmont in Montreal, where they recorded their first single, \"Give Peace a Chance\". The song became a top-20 hit for the newly christened Plastic Ono Band. Other performance/demonstrations with John included \"bagism\", iterations with John of the \"Bag Piece\"s she introduced in the early 1960s, which encouraged a disregard for physical appearance in judging others. In December 1969, the two continued to spread their message of peace with billboards in 12 major world cities reading \"WAR IS OVER! If You Want It \u2013 Happy Christmas from John &amp; Yoko\".\nIn the 1970s, Ono and Lennon became close to many radical, counterculture leaders, including Bobby Seale, Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, Michael X, John Sinclair (for whose rally in Michigan they flew to sing Lennon's song \"Free John Sinclair\" that effectively released the poet from prison), Angela Davis, and street musician David Peel. Friend and \"Sexual Politics\" author Kate Millett has said Ono inspired her activism. Ono and Lennon appeared on \"The Mike Douglas Show\", taking over hosting duties for a week. Ono spoke at length about the evils of racism and sexism. She remained outspoken in her support of feminism, and openly bitter about the racism she had experienced from rock fans, especially in the UK. Her reception within the US media was not much better. For example, an \"Esquire\" article of the period was titled \"John Rennon's Excrusive Gloupie\" and featured an unflattering David Levine cartoon.\nAfter the Columbine High School massacre in 1999, Ono paid for billboards to be put up in New York City and Los Angeles that bore the image of Lennon's blood-splashed spectacles. Early in 2002 she paid about \u00a3150,000 ($213,375) for a billboard in Piccadilly Circus with a line from Lennon's \"Imagine\": \"Imagine all the people living life in peace.\" Later the same year, she inaugurated a peace award, the LennonOno Grant for Peace, by giving $50,000 (\u00a331,900) in prize money originally to artists living \"in regions of conflict\". The award is given out every two years in conjunction with the lighting of the Imagine Peace Tower, and was first given to Israeli and Palestinian artists. Its program has since expanded to include writers, such as Michael Pollan and Alice Walker, activists such as Vandana Shiva and Pussy Riot, organizations such as New York's Center for Constitutional Rights, even an entire country (Iceland).\nOn Valentine's Day 2003, which was the eve of the Iraqi invasion by the US and UK, Ono heard about a couple, Andrew and Christine Gale, who were holding a love-in protest in their tiny bedroom in Addingham, West Yorkshire. She phoned them and said, \"It's good to speak to you. We're supporting you. We're all sisters together.\" The couple said that songs like \"Give Peace a Chance\" and \"Imagine\" inspired their protest. In 2004, Ono remade her song \"Everyman... Everywoman...\" to support same-sex marriage, releasing remixes that included \"Every Man Has a Man Who Loves Him\" and \"Every Woman Has a Woman Who Loves Her\".\nIn August 2011, she made the documentary film about the Bed-ins \"Bed Peace\" available for free on YouTube, and as part of her website \"Imagine Peace\".\nIn January 2013, the 79-year-old Ono, along with Sean Lennon and Susan Sarandon, took to rural Pennsylvania in a bus under the banner of the Artists Against Fracking group she and Sean created with Mark Ruffalo in August 2012 to protest against hydraulic fracturing. Other group members include Lady Gaga and Alec Baldwin.\nOno promotes her art and shares inspirational messages and images through a robust and active Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook presence. In April 2014 her Twitter followers reached 4.69\u00a0million, while her Instagram followers exceeded 99,000. Her tweets are short instructional poems, comments on media and politics, and notes about performances.\nIn 1987, Ono travelled to Moscow to participate in the \"International Forum for a Nuclear-free World and for the Survival of Mankind\". She also visited Leningrad, where she met with members of the local John Lennon memorial club. Among these members was Kolya Vasin, who was considered the biggest Beatles fan in the Soviet Union.\nPublic appreciation of Ono's work has shifted over time and was helped by a retrospective at a Whitney Museum branch in 1989 and the 1992 release of the six-disc box set \"Onobox\". Retrospectives of her artwork have also been presented at the Japan Society in New York City in 2001, in Bielefeld, Germany, and the UK in 2008, Frankfurt, and Bilbao, Spain, in 2013 and The Museum of Modern Art in New York City in 2015. She received a Golden Lion Award for lifetime achievement from the Venice Biennale in 2009 and the 2012 Oskar Kokoschka Prize, Austria's highest award for applied contemporary art.\nIn January 2021, Ono was one of the founders of The Coda Collection, a service that launched in the U.S. via Amazon Prime Video Channels on February 18, 2021, the day Ono turned 88. The Coda Collection will feature a slew of music documentaries and concert films. Jim Spinello will run The Coda Channel. Yoko Ono added, \"John Lennon was always on the cutting edge of music and culture. The Coda Collection will be a new way for fans to connect on a deeper level.\"\nPublic image.\nFor many years, Ono was often criticized by both the press and the public. She was frequently blamed for the breakup of the Beatles and repeatedly criticized for her influence over Lennon and his music. Her experimental art was also not popularly accepted. The British press was particularly negative and prompted the couple's move to the US. As late as December 1999, \"NME\" was calling her a \"no-talent charlatan\".\nRelationship with the Beatles.\nLennon and Ono were injured in a car crash in June 1969, partway through recording \"Abbey Road\". According to journalist Barry Miles, a bed with a microphone was then installed in the studio so that Ono could make artistic comments about the album. Miles thought Ono's continual presence in the studio during the latter part of the Beatles' career put strain on Lennon's relationship with the other band members. George Harrison got into a shouting match with Lennon after Ono took one of his chocolate digestive biscuits without asking.\nThe English press dubbed Ono \"the woman who broke up the Beatles\", which had been foreseen by Paul McCartney in 1969 during the group's rehearsals for their film and album \"Let It Be\", when he said \"It's going to be such an incredible sort of comical thing, like, in fifty years' time, you know: 'They broke up 'cause Yoko sat on an amp.'\" In an interview with Dick Cavett, Lennon explicitly denied that Ono broke up the Beatles, and Harrison said during an interview with Cavett that the problems within the group began long before Ono came onto the scene. Ono herself has said that the Beatles broke up without any direct involvement from her, adding \"I don't think I could have tried even to break them up.\"\nWhile the Beatles were together, every song written by Lennon or McCartney was credited as Lennon\u2013McCartney regardless of whether the song was a collaboration or written solely by one of the two (except for those appearing on their first album, \"Please Please Me\", which originally credited the songs to McCartney\u2013Lennon). In 1976, McCartney released a live album called \"Wings over America\", which credited the five Beatles tracks as P. McCartney\u2013J. Lennon compositions, but neither Lennon nor Ono objected. After Lennon's death, however, McCartney again attempted to change the order to McCartney\u2013Lennon for songs that were solely or predominantly written by him, such as \"Yesterday\", but Ono would not allow it, saying she felt this broke an agreement that the two had made while Lennon was still alive, and the surviving former Beatle argued that such an agreement never existed. A spokesman for Ono said McCartney was making \"an attempt to rewrite history\".\nIn a \"Rolling Stone\" interview in 1987, Ono pointed out McCartney's place in the disintegration of the band. On the 1998 John Lennon anthology, \"Lennon Legend\", the composer credit of \"Give Peace a Chance\" was changed to \"John Lennon\" from its original composing credit of \"Lennon\u2013McCartney\". Although Lennon wrote the song during his tenure with the Beatles, it was both written and recorded without the help of the band, and released as Lennon's first independent single under the \"Plastic Ono Band\" moniker. Lennon subsequently expressed regret that he had not given co-writing credit to Ono instead, who actually helped him write the song. In 2002, McCartney released another live album, \"Back in the U.S. Live 2002\", and the 19 Beatles songs included are described as \"composed by Paul McCartney and John Lennon\", which reignited the debate over credits with Ono. Her spokesperson Elliott Mintz called it \"an attempt to rewrite history\". Nevertheless, Ono did not sue.\nIn 1995, after the Beatles released Lennon's \"Free as a Bird\" and \"Real Love\", with demos provided by Ono, McCartney and his family collaborated with her and Sean to create the song \"Hiroshima Sky Is Always Blue\", which commemorates the 50th anniversary of the atomic bombing of that Japanese city. Ono publicly compared Lennon to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, while McCartney, she said, more closely resembled his less-talented rival Antonio Salieri. This remark infuriated McCartney's wife Linda, who was dying from breast cancer at the time. When Linda died less than a year later, McCartney did not invite Ono to his wife's memorial service in Manhattan.\nAccepting an award at the 2005 Q Awards, Ono mentioned that Lennon had once felt insecure about his songwriting. She had responded, \"You're a good songwriter. It's not June with spoon that you write. You're a good singer, and most musicians are probably a little bit nervous about covering your songs.\"\nIn an October 2010 interview, Ono spoke about Lennon's \"lost weekend\" and her subsequent reconciliation with him. She credited McCartney with helping save her marriage to John. \"I want the world to know that it was a very touching thing that [Paul] did for John.\" While visiting Ono in March 1974, McCartney, on leaving, asked \"[W]hat will make you come back to John?\" McCartney subsequently passed her response to Lennon while visiting him in Los Angeles. \"John often said he didn't understand why Paul did this for us, but he did.\" In 2012, McCartney revealed that he did not blame Ono for the breakup of the Beatles and credited Ono with inspiring much of Lennon's post-Beatles work.\nRelationship with Julian Lennon.\nOno had a difficult relationship with her stepson Julian, but the relationship improved over the years. He expressed disappointment at her handling of Lennon's estate, and at the difference between his upbringing and Sean's, adding, \"when Dad gave up music for a couple of years to be with Sean, why couldn't he do that with me?\" Julian was left out of his father's will, and he battled Ono in court for years, settling in 1996 for an unspecified amount that the media reported was \"believed to\" be in the area of \u00a320\u00a0million, which Julian has denied.\nHe has said that he is his \"mother's boy\", which Ono has cited as the reason why she was never able to get close to him: \"Julian and I tried to be friends. Of course, if he's too friendly with me, then I think that it hurts his other relatives. He was very loyal to his mother. That was the first thing that was in his mind.\" Nevertheless, she and Sean attended the opening of Julian's photo exhibition at the Morrison Hotel in New York City in 2010, appearing for the first time for photos with Cynthia and Julian. She also promoted the exhibition on her website.\nJulian and his half-brother Sean are close.\nIn art and popular culture.\nMary Beth Edelson's \"Some Living American Women Artists/Last Supper\" (1972) appropriated Leonardo da Vinci's \"The Last Supper\", with the heads of notable women artists collaged over the heads of Christ and his apostles; Ono was among those notable women artists. This image, addressing the role of religious and art historical iconography in the subordination of women, became \"one of the most iconic images of the feminist art movement\".\nYugoslav punk rock band Pekin\u0161ka Patka recorded the song \"Za Yoko Ono\" (trans. \"For Yoko Ono\"), released on their 1980 debut album \"Plitka poezija\".\nThe post-punk rock band Death of Samantha, founded in 1983, named themselves after a song from Ono's 1972 album \"Approximately Infinite Universe\", also called \"Death of Samantha\".\nCanadian rock band Barenaked Ladies' debut single was \"Be My Yoko Ono\", first released in 1990 and later appearing on their 1992 album \"Gordon\". The lyrics are \"a shy entreaty to a potential girlfriend, caged in terms that self-deflatingly compare himself to one of pop music's foremost geniuses\". It also has a \"sarcastic imitation of Yoko Ono's unique vocal style in the bridge\".\nIn 2000, American folk singer Dar Williams recorded a song titled \"I Won't Be Your Yoko Ono\". Bryan Wawzenek of the website \"Ultimate Classic Rock\" described the song as \"us[ing] John and Yoko as a starting point for exploring love, and particularly, love between artists\".\nThe British band Elbow mentioned Ono in their song \"New York Morning\" from their 2014 album \"The Take Off and Landing of Everything\" (\"Oh, my giddy aunt, New York can talk / It's the modern Rome and folk are nice to Yoko\"). In response Ono posted an open letter to the band on her website, thanking them and reflecting on her and Lennon's relationship with the city. In Public Enemy's song \"Bring the Noise\", Chuck D and Flavor Flav rap, \"Beat is for Sonny Bono/Beat is for Yoko Ono!\" Ono's name also appears in the lyrics of the Le Tigre song \"Hot Topic\", and the Tally Hall song \"&amp;\".\nIn \"The Simpsons\"' episode 1 of season 5, \"Homer's Barbershop Quartet\", Barney, who is in Homer's band, has creative disputes within the group when he falls in love with a Japanese conceptual artist who resembles Yoko Ono.\nOno was a central theme in English comedian James Acaster's 2013 show \"Lawnmower\", which was nominated for the Edinburgh Comedy Award for Best Show.\nDiscography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAwards and nominations.\n!

She stars as the voice of Lisa Simpson on the animated television series \"The Simpsons\".\nSmith began acting in 1982 after graduating from drama school. She moved to New York City in 1984, where she appeared in the Broadway production of Tom Stoppard's \"The Real Thing\". She made her film debut in 1985's \"Heaven Help Us\", followed by roles in \"The Legend of Billie Jean\" and \"Maximum Overdrive\". She moved to Los Angeles in 1986 and took a recurring role in the television series \"Brothers\".\nIn 1987, Smith auditioned for the \"Simpsons\" shorts on \"The Tracey Ullman Show\". Smith intended to audition for the role of Bart Simpson, but the casting director felt her voice was too high, and she was cast as Bart's sister Lisa. In 1989, the shorts were spun off into their own half-hour show, \"The Simpsons\". For her work on \"The Simpsons\", Smith received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance in 1992.\nAlongside \"The Simpsons\", Smith appeared in the sitcom \"Herman's Head\" as Louise, and had recurring appearances as Marlene on \"Dharma &amp; Greg\" and as Penny in two episodes of \"Dead Like Me\". She has appeared in several films, including \"City Slickers\", \"Just Write\", \"Toys\", and \"As Good as It Gets\". In 2004, Smith performed an off-Broadway one-woman show entitled \"More\" at the Union Square Theatre in New York City. Aside from \"The Simpsons\", Smith has recorded few voice-over parts, only commercials and the film \"We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story\". Smith starred in and served as executive producer for the independent romantic comedy \"Waiting For Ophelia\", which had its world premiere at the Phoenix Film Festival in April 2009.\nEarly life.\nSmith was born on July 3, 1964, in Paris, France. Her father, Joseph Smith, worked for United Press International in Paris and moved to Washington, D.C., in 1966, where he became \"The Washington Post\"'s first official obituary editor. Her mother, Martha Mayor, was a paper conservator for the Freer and Sackler Galleries at the Smithsonian Institution. Smith's parents later divorced. Her maternal grandfather was art historian A. Hyatt Mayor, and among her great-grandparents were marine biologist and zoologist Alpheus Hyatt and artist and sculptor Harriet Randolph Hyatt Mayor. She is also the paternal niece of political scientist, historian, and Latin American studies specialist Peter H. Smith. Smith has labeled her family \"upper crust and reserved\". As a child, Smith was often teased because of her unusual voice. Smith has stated: \"I've sounded pretty much the same way since I was six. Maybe [my voice is] a little deeper now.\" She made her acting debut in a sixth-grade play.\nCareer.\nEarly career.\nSmith became a professional actress in 1982. After appearances in a number of school plays, she joined the local Arena Stage theater group on an apprenticeship, featuring in their production of \"Peter Pan\". She went on to star in several other plays in Washington. She moved to New York City in 1984 and appeared in the Broadway production of Tom Stoppard's play \"The Real Thing\" alongside Jeremy Irons and Glenn Close.\nSmith's first film role came in \"Heaven Help Us\" (1985). She then played Putter in \"The Legend of Billie Jean\" (also 1985). The film was a box office bomb and critically panned, although Smith \"thought it would be the movie that launched my career. And then it was out at the box office about 10 days before it died.\" When filming was over, she rejoined \"The Real Thing\" before being out of work for six months. Smith worried her career was over. However, the following year, she played Connie in Stephen King's \"Maximum Overdrive\" (1986), noting it was \"truly a dreadful film, but I had a great part in it.\"\nSmith moved to Los Angeles in 1986 on the \"semi-promise\" of a part in a TV film. After the audition, the role was given to another actress. Smith realized \"that people don't mean what they say. It's not malicious. They just don't realize how much impact they have on an impressionable actor \u2013 and all actors are impressionable.\" From then on, she decided to \"just sort of build a wall around myself\", to cope with the disappointment of not getting a part. In Los Angeles, Smith appeared in theatrical productions of \"Living on Salvation Street\", for which she was paid $14 for each performance, \"Boys and Girls/Men and Women\", and \"How the Other Half Loves\", and played the recurring role of Louella Waters on the Showtime series \"Brothers\". She appeared in the films \"The Legend of Billie Jean\" and \"Ginger Ale Afternoon\" (1989) as \"trailer-park girls\". She later spoke of her regrets of appearing in the latter in her one-woman show \"More\".\n\"The Simpsons\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIt's a happy fluke. When she was cast back in 1987, I just liked the sound of her voice. She's also a great actress. In general, people who make their living doing voices on cartoons aren't always great for us. Most cartoons want things peppy and cartoony. Yeardley is able to go through moments of great emotion and wring it for all she's worth.\n\u2014Matt Groening on Smith's vocal style\nSmith's longest-running role is voicing Lisa Simpson on \"The Simpsons\". She has voiced Lisa since 1987, beginning with \"The Simpsons shorts\" on \"The Tracey Ullman Show\". Smith had initially been asked to audition for the role of Lisa's brother Bart, but casting director Bonita Pietila thought her voice was too high. Smith later recalled \"I always sounded too much like a girl, I read two lines as Bart and they said, 'Thanks for coming!'\" Smith was given the role of Lisa, instead. She denies rumors that she almost turned down the role, though admits she had never planned a career in voice-over work. Pietila stated that, having seen her in \"Living on Salvation Street\", Smith was always her preferred choice. Smith lifts her voice up slightly to perform the role. Lisa is the only regular character voiced by Smith, although in some earlier episodes, she provided some of Maggie's squeaks and occasional speaking parts. Smith has only voiced characters other than Lisa on very rare occasions, with those characters usually being some derivative of Lisa, such as Lisa Bella in \"Last Tap Dance in Springfield\" and Lisa Jr. in \" (both from season 11 in 2000). Smith spends two days a week recording the show.\nUntil 1998, Smith was paid $30,000 per episode. During a pay dispute in 1998, Fox threatened to replace the six main voice actors with new actors, going as far as preparing to cast new voices. However, the dispute was soon resolved and she received $125,000 per episode until 2004, when the voice actors demanded that they be paid $360,000 per episode. The issue was resolved a month later, and Smith earned $250,000 per episode. After salary renegotiations in 2008, the voice actors received about $400,000 per episode. Three years later, with Fox threatening to cancel the series unless production costs were cut, Smith and the other cast members accepted a 25% pay cut, down to just over $300,000 per episode.\nDespite her world-famous role, Smith is rarely recognized in public, which she does not mind, saying, \"it's wonderful to be in the midst of all this hype about the show, and people enjoying the show so much, and to be totally a fly on the wall; people never recognise me solely from my voice.\" In a 2009 interview with \"The Guardian\", she commented: \"It's the best job ever. I have nothing but gratitude for the amount of freedom \"The Simpsons\" has bought me in my life.\"\nSmith received a Primetime Emmy Award in 1992, but felt it was not worth anything, saying \"there's part of me that feels it wasn't even a real Emmy.\" The Emmy for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance is a Creative Arts and not handed out during the primetime telecast and, prior to 2009, was a juried award without nominations. However, Smith says \"if I had to be associated with one character in fiction, I will always be thrilled that it was Lisa Simpson.\" The show's creator Matt Groening has called Smith very similar to Lisa: \"Yeardley has strong moral views about her character. There are lines that are written for Lisa that Yeardley reads and says, 'No, I wouldn't say that.'\" Writer Jay Kogen praised her performance on the show, particularly in the episode \"Lisa's Substitute\", as able \"to move past comedy to something really strong and serious and dramatic\".\nFurther career.\nFrom 1991 to 1994, alongside \"The Simpsons\", Smith was one of the lead cast members in the sitcom \"Herman's Head\" as Louise. Her other television roles include recurring appearances as Marlene on \"Dharma &amp; Greg\", and Penny in two episodes of \"Dead Like Me\". Smith has also appeared in \"Phil of the Future\" and \"Teen Angel\". Her one-scene role as pregnant checkout girl Nancy in 1991's \"City Slickers\" earned her \"more attention than all [her] previous roles combined\", and taught her \"that it's far better to have small parts in big movies that everyone sees.\" In 1997, she appeared as Lulu the palm reader in the independent film \"Just Write\". Her other roles include parts in Barry Levinson's \"Toys\" and James L. Brooks' \"As Good as It Gets\". Brooks, who is also executive producer of \"The Simpsons\", had cast Smith in his 1994 film \"I'll Do Anything\" (in one of the film's musical numbers), but her part was cut. Aside from \"The Simpsons\", Smith has recorded few voice-over parts, only commercials and the film \"We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story\". She \"had a voice-over agent for about two years, and I used to go out [on auditions] all the time, but it never really came to anything. Everybody said, 'Oh Yeardley, you'll clean up,' and that was definitely not the case.\"\nIn 2004, Smith performed her own off-Broadway one-woman show entitled \"More\" at the Union Square Theatre in New York City. Directed by Judith Ivey, the play is about her mixed feelings over the success of \"The Simpsons\", her parents, her relationships, and her struggles with bulimia. \"The New York Times\" critic Margo Jefferson called it an \"appealing if overlong show\", adding that \"The career narrative needed shortening. This would involve some editing and revising but wouldn't taint the best parts of \"More.\" It is refreshing to hear a celebrity talk cleanly about being fame-driven and about not getting the degree or the kind of fame you craved. It's fun to watch a skilled actress use her craft to the full.\" She would later perform the play for three weeks in Los Angeles the following year.\nSmith starred in and served as executive producer for the independent romantic comedy \"Waiting for Ophelia\", which was released in 2009. She funded the film, which was written by Adam Carl and based on a stage play he wrote in 2003. She said: \"I loved it. I never get to play parts like that. I always play the friend of a friend, never the lead. And the script surprised me.\" Carl stated it was very unlikely she would recoup her money, but Smith decided she \"believe[d] in this project, and my expectations have already been fulfilled by making the movie\", and added: \"You can support art even if it's not going to make a zillion dollars.\" It premiered on April 4, 2009, at the Phoenix Film Festival.\nIn 2010 she had a small but attention-getting guest role in The Big Bang Theory, as a counselor trying to place Sheldon in a job.\nIn 2011, Smith starred as Ms. Miller in the movie \"The Chaperone\" alongside Triple H and Ariel Winter.\nIn June 2016, the Human Rights Campaign released a video in tribute to the victims of the Orlando nightclub shooting; in the video, Smith and others told the stories of the people killed there. On March 30, 2019, Smith was honored with the Human Rights Campaign's National Leadership Award in Los Angeles for her work as an advocate of the LGBT community.\nIn 2017, Smith started a podcast, \"Small Town Dicks\", which explores real life crime in small towns in the United States. Smith had co-hosted the podcast with actress and long-time friend Zibby Allen until March 2019 when the two filed lawsuits against one another, with Allen accusing Smith of pushing her out of ownership and profit rights from the show.\nPolitics.\nSmith is a lifelong Democrat.\nIn 2018, Smith mocked Republican Ted Cruz after he labeled the Democratic Party as \"the party of Lisa Simpson\". Smith recommended that people of differing political views should be able to work together on gun control, promoting gay rights and environmentalism.\nPersonal life.\nSmith married English-Canadian actor Christopher Grove in 1990. They were divorced in 1992, citing irreconcilable differences.\nIn a 1997 interview with \"The Daily Targum\", Smith stated \"I am shy, but I have an extroverted persona which I can draw on when I need to,\" and that she is a \"private\" actress.\nShe married Daniel Erickson in 2002; the marriage lasted for six years and Smith filed for divorce on May 21, 2008, citing irreconcilable differences.\nIn 2009, she commented, \"People have said to me that I'm unassuming. It's true, I'm the worst celebrity ever. But I'm trying to become better.\"\nSmith had bulimia when she was a teenager. She noted \"It would make me high, I would feel endorphins and this great sense of victory.\"\nSmith enjoys writing and painting. During the first season of \"Herman's Head\", Smith taught herself to paint by copying other artists. The book \"Just Humor Me\" includes a story, \"The Race\", written by Smith. She has written a children's book, \"I, Lorelei\", which was published by HarperCollins in February 2009.\nIn 2011, Smith launched a women's shoe line called Marchez Vous.\nIn November 2021, Yeardley was noted for producing a podcast on the murder of Sheila Anderson, one of Scotland's most notorious unsolved murders.\nOn June 11, 2022, Smith married one of the co-hosts of her podcast, \"Small Town Dicks\", Detective (Ret) Dan Grice. She met him while he was providing personal security for her during a \"Simpsons\" event.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Situated along the Hrazdan River, Yerevan is the administrative, cultural, and industrial centre of the country, as its primate city. It has been the capital since 1918, the fourteenth in the history of Armenia and the seventh located in or around the Ararat Plain. The city also serves as the seat of the Araratian Pontifical Diocese, which is the largest diocese of the Armenian Apostolic Church and one of the oldest dioceses in the world.\nThe history of Yerevan dates back to the 8th century BC, with the founding of the fortress of Erebuni in 782 BC by King Argishti I of Urartu at the western extreme of the Ararat Plain. Erebuni was \"designed as a great administrative and religious centre, a fully royal capital.\" By the late ancient Armenian Kingdom, new capital cities were established and Yerevan declined in importance. The city was mostly depopulated by the Great Surgun of 1603\u201305, when the Safavid Empire forcibly deported hundreds of thousands of Armenians to Iran. In 1679, the city was mostly destroyed by an earthquake, and then rebuilt on a smaller scale. In 1828, Yerevan became part of the Russian Empire, which led to the repatriation of Armenians whose ancestors had been forcibly relocated in the 17th century. After World War I, Yerevan became the capital of the First Republic of Armenia as thousands of survivors of the Armenian genocide in the Ottoman Empire arrived in the area. The city expanded rapidly during the 20th century while Armenia was a part of the Soviet Union. In a few decades, Yerevan was transformed from a provincial town within the Russian Empire to Armenia's principal cultural, artistic, and industrial centre, as well as becoming the seat of national government.\nWith the growth of the Armenian economy, Yerevan has undergone major transformation. Much construction has been done throughout the city since the early 2000s, and retail outlets such as restaurants, shops, and street caf\u00e9s, which were rare during Soviet times, have multiplied. As of 2011[ [update]], the population of Yerevan was 1,060,138, just over 35% of Armenia's total population. By 2022, the population further increased to 1,086,677. Yerevan was named the 2012 World Book Capital by UNESCO. Yerevan is an associate member of Eurocities.\nOf the notable landmarks of Yerevan, Erebuni Fortress is considered to be the birthplace of the city, the Katoghike Tsiranavor church is the oldest surviving church of Yerevan, and Saint Gregory Cathedral is the largest Armenian cathedral in the world. Tsitsernakaberd is the official memorial to the victims of the Armenian genocide. The city is home to several opera houses, theatres, museums, libraries, and other cultural institutions. Yerevan Opera Theatre is the main spectacle hall of the Armenian capital, the National Gallery of Armenia is the largest art museum in Armenia and shares a building with the History Museum of Armenia, and the Matenadaran contains one of the largest depositories of ancient books and manuscripts in the world.\nEtymology.\nThe exact origin of the name is unknown. One theory regarding the origin of Yerevan's name is the city was named after the Armenian king, Yervand (Orontes) IV, the last ruler of Armenia from the Orontid dynasty, and founder of the city of Yervandashat. However, it is likely that the city's name is derived from the Urartian military fortress of Erebuni, which was founded on the territory of modern-day Yerevan in 782 BC by Argishti I. \"Erebuni\" may derive from the Urartian word for \"to take\" or \"to capture,\" meaning that the fortress's name could be interpreted as \"capture,\" \"conquest,\" or \"victory.\" As elements of the Urartian language blended with that of the Armenian one, the name eventually evolved into \"Yerevan\" (Erebuni = Erevani = Erevan = Yerevan). Scholar Margarit Israelyan notes these changes when comparing inscriptions found on two cuneiform tablets at Erebuni:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The transcription of the second cuneiform \"bu\" [original emphasis] of the word was very essential in our interpretation as it is the Urartaean \"b\" that has been shifted to the Armenian \"v\" (b &gt; v). The original writing of the inscription read \u00aber-bu-ni\u00bb; therefore the prominent Armenianologist-orientalist Prof. G. A. Ghapantsian justly objected, remarking that the Urartu \"b\" changed to \"v\" at the beginning of the word (Biani &gt; Van) or between two vowels (ebani &gt; avan, Zabaha &gt; Javakhk)...In other words \"b\" was placed between two vowels. The true pronunciation of the fortress-city was apparently \"Erebuny\".\nEarly Christian Armenian chroniclers connected the origin of the city's name to the legend of Noah's Ark. After the ark had landed on Mount Ararat and the flood waters had receded, Noah, while looking in the direction of Yerevan, is said to have exclaimed \"Yerevats!\" (\"it appeared!\" in Armenian), from which originated the name Yerevan.\nIn the late medieval and early modern periods, when Yerevan was under Turkic and later Persian rule, the city was known in Persian as (). The city was officially known as Erivan () under Russian rule during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The city was renamed back to Yerevan (\u0415\u0440\u0435\u0432\u0430\u043d) in 1936. Up until the mid-1970s the city's name was spelled Erevan more often than Yerevan in English sources.\nSymbols.\nThe principal symbol of Yerevan is Mount Ararat, which is visible from any area in the capital. The seal of the city is a crowned lion on a pedestal with a shield that has a depiction of Mount Ararat on the upper part and half of an Armenian eternity sign on the bottom part. The emblem is a rectangular shield with a blue border.\nOn 27 September 2004, Yerevan adopted an anthem, \"Erebuni-Yerevan\", using lyrics written by Paruyr Sevak and set to music composed by Edgar Hovhannisyan. It was selected in a competition for a new anthem and new flag that would best represent the city. The chosen flag has a white background with the city's seal in the middle, surrounded by twelve small red triangles that symbolise the twelve historic capitals of Armenia. The flag includes the three colours of the Armenian National flag. The lion is portrayed on the orange background with blue edging.\nHistory.\nPre-history and pre-classical era.\nThe territory of Yerevan has been inhabited since approximately the 2nd half of the 4th millennium BC. The southern part of the city currently known as Shengavit has been populated since at least 3200 BC, during the period of Kura\u2013Araxes culture of the early Bronze Age. The first excavations at the Shengavit historical site was conducted between 1936 and 1938 under the guidance of archaeologist Yevgeny Bayburdyan. After two decades, archaeologist Sandro Sardarian resumed the excavations starting from 1958 until 1983. The 3rd phase of the excavations started in 2000, under the guidance of archaeologist Hakob Simonyan. In 2009, Simonyan was joined by Mitchell S. Rothman from the Widener University of Pennsylvania. Together they conducted three series of excavations in 2009, 2010, and 2012 respectively. During the process, a full stratigraphic column to bedrock was reached, showing there to be 8 or 9 distinct stratigraphic levels. These levels cover a time between 3200 BC and 2500 BC. Evidences of later use of the site, possibly until 2200 BC, were also found. The excavation process revealed a series of large round buildings with square adjoining rooms and minor round buildings. A series of ritual installations was discovered in 2010 and 2012.\nErebuni.\nThe ancient kingdom of Urartu was formed in the 9th century BC by King Arame in the basin of Lake Van of the Armenian Highland, including the territory of modern-day Yerevan. Archaeological evidence, such as a cuneiform inscription, indicates that the Urartian military fortress of Erebuni was founded in 782 BC by the orders of King Argishti I at the site of modern-day Yerevan, to serve as a fort and citadel guarding against attacks from the north Caucasus. The cuneiform inscription found at Erebuni Fortress reads:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;By the greatness of the God Khaldi, Argishti, son of Menua, built this mighty stronghold and proclaimed it Erebuni for the glory of Biainili [Urartu] and to instill fear among the king's enemies. Argishti says, \"The land was a desert, before the great works I accomplished upon it. By the greatness of Khaldi, Argishti, son of Menua, is a mighty king, king of Biainili, and ruler of Tushpa.\"[Van].\nDuring the height of the Urartian power, irrigation canals and artificial reservoirs were built in Erebuni and its surrounding territories.\nIn the mid-7th century BC, the city of Teishebaini was built by Rusa II of Urartu, around west of Erebuni Fortress. It was fortified on a hill -currently known as Karmir Blur within Shengavit District of Yerevan- to protect the eastern borders of Urartu from the barbaric Cimmerians and Scythians. During excavations, the remains of a governors palace that contained a hundred and twenty rooms spreading across more than was found, along with a citadel dedicated to the Urartian god Teisheba. The construction of the city of Teishebaini, as well as the palace and the citadel was completed by the end of the 7th century BC, during the reign of Rusa III. However, Teishebaini was destroyed by an alliance of Medes and the Scythians in 585 BC.\nMedian and Achaemenid rules.\nIn 590 BC, following the fall of the Kingdom of Urartu at the hands of the Iranian Medes, Erebuni along with the Armenian Highlands became part of the Median Empire.\nHowever, in 550 BC, the Median Empire was conquered by Cyrus the Great, and Erebuni became part of the Achaemenid Empire. Between 522 BC and 331 BC, Erebuni was one of the main centres of the Satrapy of Armenia, a region controlled by the Orontid dynasty as one of the satrapies of the Achaemenid Empire. The Satrapy of Armenia was divided into two parts: the northern part and the southern part, with the cities of Erebuni (Yerevan) and Tushpa (Van) as their centres, respectively.\nCoins issued in 478 BC, along with many other items found in the Erebuni Fortress, reveal the importance of Erebuni as a major centre for trade under Achaemenid rule.\nAncient Kingdom of Armenia.\nAfter Alexander the Great's victory over the Achaemenid Empire, the Orontid rulers of the Armenian satrapy achieved independence as a result of the Battle of Gaugamela in 331 BC, founding the Kingdom of Armenia. With the establishment of new cities such as Armavir, Zarehavan, Bagaran and Yervandashat, the importance of Erebuni gradually declined.\nWith the rise of the Artaxiad dynasty of Armenia who seized power in 189 BC, the Kingdom of Armenia greatly expanded to include major territories of Asia Minor, Atropatene, Iberia, Phoenicia and Syria. The Artaxiads considered Erebuni and Tushpa as cities of Persian heritage. Consequently, new cities and commercial centres were built by Kings Artaxias I, Artavasdes I and Tigranes the Great. Thus, with the dominance of cities such as Artaxata and Tigranocerta, Erebuni significantly lost its importance as a central city.\nUnder the rule of the Arsacid dynasty of Armenia (54\u2013428 AD), many other cities around Erebuni including Vagharshapat and Dvin flourished. Consequently, Erebuni was completely neutralised, losing its role as an economic and strategic centre of Armenia. During the period of the Arsacid kings, Erebuni was only recorded in a Manichaean text of the 3rd century, where it is mentioned that one of the disciples of the prophet Mani founded a Manichaean community near the Christian community in Erebuni.\nAccording to the medieval Armenian geography \"Ashkharhatsuyts\", Erebuni was part of the canton () of Kotayk (not to be confused with the current Kotayk Province) of the province of Ayrarat, within Armenia Major.\nArmenia became a Christian nation in the early 4th century AD, during the reign of the Arsacid king Tiridates III.\nSasanian and Roman periods.\nFollowing the partition of Armenia by the Byzantine and Sasanian empires in 387 and in 428, Erebuni and the entire territory of Eastern Armenia came under the rule of Sasanian Persia. The Armenian territories formed the province of Persian Armenia within the Sasanian Empire.\nDue to the diminished role of Erebuni, as well as the absence of proper historical data, much of the city's history under the Sasanian rule is unknown.\nIn 587, during the reign of emperor Maurice, Yerevan and much of Armenia came under Roman administration after the Romans defeated the Sassanid Persian Empire at the battle of the Blarathon. Soon after, Katoghike Tsiranavor Church in Avan was built between 595 and 602. Despite being partly damaged during the 1679 earthquake), it is the oldest surviving church within modern Yerevan city limits.\nThe province of Persian Armenia (also known as Persarmenia) lasted until 646, when the province was dissolved with the Muslim conquest of Persia.\nArab Islamic invasion.\nIn 658 AD, at the height of the Arab Islamic invasions, Erebuni-Yerevan was conquered during the Muslim conquest of Persia, as it was part of Persian-ruled Armenia. The city became part of the Emirate of Armenia under the Umayyad Caliphate. The city of Dvin was the centre of the newly created emirate. Starting from this period, as a result of the developing trade activities with the Arabs, the Armenian territories had gained strategic importance as a crossroads for the Arab caravan routes passing between Europe and India through the Arab-controlled Ararat Plain of Armenia. Most probably, \"Erebuni\" has become known as \"Yerevan\" since at least the 7th century AD.\nBagratid Armenia.\nAfter two centuries of Islamic rule over Armenia, the Bagratid prince Ashot I of Armenia led the revolution against the Abbasid Caliphate. Ashot I liberated Yerevan in 850, and was recognised as the Prince of Princes of Armenia by the Abbasid Caliph al-Musta'in in 862. Ashot was later crowned King of Armenia through the consent of Caliph al-Mu'tamid in 885. During the rule of the Bagratuni dynasty of Armenia between 885 and 1045, Yerevan was relatively a secure part of the Kingdom before falling to the Byzantines.\nHowever, Yerevan did not have any strategic role during the reign of the Bagratids, who developed many other cities of Ayrarat, such as Shirakavan, Dvin, and Ani.\nSeljuk period, Zakarid Armenia and Mongol rule.\nAfter a brief Byzantine rule over Armenia between 1045 and 1064, the invading Seljuks\u2014led by Tughril and later by his successor Alp Arslan\u2014ruled over the entire region, including Yerevan. However, with the establishment of the Zakarid Principality of Armenia in 1201 under the Georgian protectorate, the Armenian territories of Yerevan and Lori had significantly grown. After the Mongols captured Ani in 1236, Armenia turned into a Mongol protectorate as part of the Ilkhanate, and the Zakarids became vassals to the Mongols. After the fall of the Ilkhanate in the mid-14th century, the Zakarid princes ruled over Lori, Shirak and the Ararat Plain until 1360 when they fell to the invading Turkic tribes.\nAq Qoyunlu and Kara Koyunlu tribes.\nDuring the last quarter of the 14th century, the Aq Qoyunlu Sunni Oghuz Turkic tribe took over Armenia, including Yerevan. In 1400, Timur invaded Armenia and Georgia, and captured more than 60,000 of the survived local people as slaves. Many districts including Yerevan were depopulated.\nIn 1410, Armenia fell under the control of the Kara Koyunlu Shia Oghuz Turkic tribe. According to the Armenian historian Thomas of Metsoph, although the Kara Koyunlu levied heavy taxes against the Armenians, the early years of their rule were relatively peaceful and some reconstruction of towns took place. The Kara Koyunlus made Yerevan the centre of the newly formed \"Chukhur Saad\" administrative territory. The territory was named after a Turkic leader known as \"Emir Saad\".\nHowever, this peaceful period was shattered with the rise of Qara Iskander between 1420 and 1436, who reportedly made Armenia a \"desert\" and subjected it to \"devastation and plunder, to slaughter, and captivity\". The wars of Iskander and his eventual defeat against the Timurids, invited further destruction in Armenia, as many more Armenians were taken captive and sold into slavery and the land was subjected to outright pillaging, forcing many of them to leave the region.\nFollowing the fall of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia in 1375, the seat of the Armenian Church was transferred from Sis back to Vagharshapat near Yerevan in 1441. Thus, Yerevan became the main economic, cultural and administrative centre in Armenia.\nIranian rule.\nIn 1501\u201302, most of the Eastern Armenian territories including Yerevan were swiftly conquered by the emerging Safavid dynasty of Iran led by Shah Ismail I. Soon after in 1502, Yerevan became the centre of the Erivan Province, a new administrative territory of Iran formed by the Safavids. For the following 3 centuries, it remained, with brief intermissions, under the Iranian rule. Due to its strategic significance, Yerevan was initially often fought over, and passed back and forth, between the dominion of the rivalling Iranian and Ottoman Empire, until it permanently became controlled by the Safavids. In 1555, Iran had secured its legitimate possession over Yerevan with the Ottomans through the Treaty of Amasya.\nIn 1582\u20131583, the Ottomans led by Serdar Ferhad Pasha took brief control over Yerevan. Ferhad Pasha managed to build the Erivan Fortress on the ruins of one thousand-years old ancient Armenian fortress, on the shores of Hrazdan river. However, Ottoman control ended in 1604 when the Persians regained Yerevan as a result of first Ottoman-Safavid War.\nShah Abbas I of Persia who ruled between 1588 and 1629, ordered the deportation of hundreds of thousands of Armenians including citizens from Yerevan to mainland Persia. As a consequence, Yerevan significantly lost its Armenian population who had declined to 20%, while Muslims including Persians, Turks, Kurds and Tatars gained dominance with around 80% of the city's population. Muslims were either sedentary, semi-sedentary, or nomadic. Armenians mainly occupied the Kond neighbourhood of Yerevan and the rural suburbs around the city. However, the Armenians dominated over various professions and trade in the area and were of great economic significance to the Persian administration.\nDuring the second Ottoman-Safavid War, Ottoman troops under the command of Sultan Murad IV conquered the city on 8 August 1635. Returning in triumph to Constantinople, he opened the \"Yerevan Kiosk\" (\"Revan K\u00f6\u015fk\u00fc\") in Topkap\u0131 Palace in 1636. However, Iranian troops commanded by Shah Safi retook Yerevan on 1 April 1636. As a result of the Treaty of Zuhab in 1639, the Iranians reconfirmed their control over Eastern Armenia, including Yerevan. On 7 June 1679, a devastating earthquake razed the city to the ground.\nIn 1724, the Erivan Fortress was besieged by the Ottoman army. After a period of resistance, the fortress fell to the Turks. As a result of the Ottoman invasion, the Erivan Province of the Safavids was dissolved.\nFollowing a brief period of Ottoman rule over Eastern Armenia between 1724 and 1736, and as a result of the fall of the Safavid dynasty in 1736, Yerevan along with the adjacent territories became part of the newly formed administrative territory of Erivan Khanate under the Afsharid dynasty of Iran, which encompassed an area of . The Afsharids controlled Eastern Armenia from the mid-1730s until the 1790s. Following the fall of the Afsharids, the Qajar dynasty of Iran took control of Eastern Armenia until 1828, when the region was conquered by the Russian Empire after their victory over the Qajars that resulted in the Treaty of Turkmenchay of 1828.\nRussian rule.\nDuring the second Russo-Persian War of the 19th century, the Russo-Persian War of 1826\u20131828, Yerevan was captured by Russian troops under general Ivan Paskevich on 1 October 1827. It was formally ceded by the Iranians in 1828, following the Treaty of Turkmenchay. After 3 centuries of Iranian occupation, Yereven along with the rest of Eastern Armenia designated as the \"Armenian Oblast\", became part of the Russian Empire, a period that would last until the collapse of the Empire in 1917.\nAlthough not mentioned specifically by name, article XV of the Turkmenchay treaty was intended solely for the repatriation of those Armenians whose ancestors had been forcibly relocated to Iran in the early 17th century during the Safavid period. The Russians sponsored the resettlement process of the Armenian population from Persia and Turkey and spread announcements in Armenian villages. Due to the resettlement, the percentage of the Armenian population of Yerevan increased from 28% to 53.8%. The resettlement was intended to create Russian power bridgehead in the Middle East. In 1829, Armenian repatriates from Persia were resettled in the city and a new quarter was built.\nYerevan served as the seat of the newly formed Armenian Oblast between 1828 and 1840. By the time of Nicholas I's visit in 1837, Yerevan had become an \"uezd\" (\"county\"). In 1840, the Armenian Oblast was dissolved and its territory incorporated into a new larger province; the Georgia-Imeretia Governorate. In 1850 the territory of the former oblast was reorganised into the Erivan Governorate, covering an area of . Yerevan served as the centre of the newly established governorate until 1917.\nAt that period, Yerevan was a small town with narrow roads and alleys, including the central quarter of \"Shahar\", the \"Ghantar\" commercial centre, and the residential neighbourhoods of Kond, Dzoragyugh, Nork and Shentagh. During the 1840s and the 1850s, many schools were opened in the city. However, the first major plan of Yerevan was adopted in 1856, during which, Saint Hripsime and Saint Gayane women's colleges were founded and the English Park was opened. In 1863, the Astafyan Street was redeveloped and opened. In 1874, Zacharia Gevorkian opened Yerevan's first printing house, while the first theatre opened its doors in 1879.\nOn 1 October 1879, Yerevan was granted the status of a city through a decree issued by Alexander II of Russia. In 1881, The Yerevan Teachers' Seminary and the Yerevan Brewery were opened, followed by the Tairyan's wine and brandy factory in 1887. Other factories for alcoholic beverages and mineral water were opened during the 1890s. The monumental church of Saint Gregory the Illuminator was opened in 1900. Electricity and telephone lines were introduced to the city in 1907 and 1913 respectively. When British traveller H. F. B. Lynch visited Yerevan in 1893\u20131894, he considered it an Oriental city. However, this started to change in the first decade of the 20th century, in the penultimate decade of Imperial Russian rule, when the city grew and altered dramatically. In general, Yerevan rapidly grew under Russian rule, both economically and politically. Old buildings were torn down and new buildings of European style were erected.\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, Yerevan city's population was over 29,000. In 1902, a railway line linked Yerevan with Alexandropol, Tiflis and Julfa. In the same year, Yerevan's first public library was opened. In 1905, the grandnephew of Napoleon I; prince Louis Joseph J\u00e9r\u00f4me Napol\u00e9on (1864\u20131932) was appointed as governor of Yerevan province. In 1913, for the first time in the city, a telephone line with eighty subscribers became operational.\nBrief independence.\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, Yerevan was a small city with a population of 30,000. In 1917, the Russian Empire ended with the October Revolution. In the aftermath, Armenian, Georgian and Muslim leaders of Transcaucasia united to form the Transcaucasian Federation and proclaimed Transcaucasia's secession.\nThe Federation, however, was short-lived. After gaining control over Alexandropol, the Turkish army was advancing towards the south and east to eliminate the centre of Armenian resistance based in Yerevan. On 21 May 1918, the Turks started their campaign moving towards Yerevan via Sardarabad. Catholicos Gevorg V ordered that church bells peal for 6 days as Armenians from all walks of life \u2013 peasants, poets, blacksmiths, and even the clergymen \u2013 rallied to form organised military units. Civilians, including children, aided in the effort as well, as \"Carts drawn by oxen, water buffalo, and cows jammed the roads bringing food, provisions, ammunition, and volunteers from the vicinity\" of Yerevan.\nBy the end of May 1918, Armenians were able to defeat the Turkish army in the battles of Sardarabad, Abaran and Karakilisa. Thus, on 28 May 1918, the Dashnak leader Aram Manukian declared the independence of Armenia. Subsequently, Yerevan became the capital and the centre of the newly founded First Republic of Armenia, although the members of the Armenian National Council were yet to stay in Tiflis until their arrival in Yerevan to form the government in the summer of the same year. Armenia became a parliamentary republic with four administrative divisions. The capital Yerevan was part of the \"Araratian Province\". At the time, Yerevan received more than 75,000 refugees from Western Armenia, who escaped the massacres perpetrated by the Ottoman Turks during the Armenian genocide.\nSoviet era.\nThe 11th Red Army entered Armenia on 29 November 1920, beginning the end of the First Republic. On 2 December 1920, Yerevan became the capital of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic, one of the constituent republics of the emerging Soviet Union and initially part of the Transcaucasian SFSR with Soviet Georgia and Soviet Azerbaijan. The Soviet government in Yerevan was briefly overturned by the former leaders of the First Republic in the February Uprising of 1921. However, Soviet authority was restored with the defeat of the rebels in early April.\nWithin the USSR, Yerevan saw significant development during Vladimir Lenin's New Economic Policy (NEP). The city became the first in the Soviet Union for which a general plan was developed. The \"General Plan of Yerevan\" was devised by the architect Alexander Tamanian and approved by Soviet authorities in 1924. Tamanian's plan was initially designed for a population of 150,000. However, as the Armenian capital grew rapidly into a modern industrial metropolis, Tamanian began developing plans for a Greater Yerevan of 500,000 residents in 1934. Many of the districts around central Yerevan were named after former Armenian communities that were destroyed by the Ottoman Turks during the Armenian genocide. The areas of Arabkir, Nor Kilikia, and Nor Zeytun, for example, were named after Arabkir, Cilicia, and Zeitun, respectively.\nTamanian incorporated national traditions into contemporary urban construction, bringing together neoclassicism with the organic tuff stone of Armenia. His design presented a radial-circular arrangement that overlaid the existing city and incorporated much of its existing street plan. As a result, many historic buildings were demolished, including churches, mosques, the Erivan Fortress, baths, bazaars and caravanserais. Tamanian's successor, Mark Grigorian, noted that Tamanian originally included a monument to Lenin in his plans. However, this was not realised until after Tamanian's death, when Anastas Mikoyan urged the Soviet Armenian leadership to \"actively pursue the matter.\" The monument, designed by Sergey Merkurov, was inaugurated at Lenin Square (today Republic Square) on 24 November 1940.\nAs a major industrial centre, Yerevan contributed significantly to the Soviet war effort during the Great Patriotic War of World War II. After the war, following the death of Joseph Stalin, Mikoyan flew to Yerevan and gave a speech on 11 March 1954, where he called for the rehabilitation of Yeghishe Charents, marking the start of the Khrushchev Thaw in Armenia. Behind the scenes, the statesman advised Armenian officials on several major projects in the city, such as the Hrazdan Stadium. As part of de-Stalinisation, the massive statue of Stalin that towered over Yerevan was removed from its pedestal by troops in 1962 and replaced in 1967 with that of Mother Armenia.\nOn 24 April 1965, thousands of Yerevantsis demonstrated on the 50th anniversary of the Armenian genocide. Two years later, in 1967, the memorial honouring the genocide victims was erected at Tsitsernakaberd hill above the Hrazdan gorge. Under the leadership of Armenian First Secretary Karen Demirchyan, Yerevan witnessed the realisation of additional large-scale projects, such as the Yerevan Metro, the Karen Demirchyan Complex, and Zvartnots International Airport. In 1968, the Armenian capital commemorated its 2,750th anniversary.\nYerevan played a major role in the rise of the Karabakh movement. Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms of \"glasnost\" and \"perestroika\" created the conditions for open discussion on the rights of the Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians, as well as other issues such as the legacies of Stalinism, ecological concerns, and eventually independence. By the beginning of 1988, nearly one million Armenians from several regions of the republic engaged in demonstrations in support of the Karabakh movement, centred on Yerevan's Theater Square (today Freedom Square).\nModern independence.\nFollowing the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Yerevan became the capital of the independent Republic of Armenia on 21 September 1991. The monument to Lenin was removed from Republic Square even before independence, on 13 April 1991, although mayor Hambardzum Galstyan argued in favour of a more nuanced and tolerant position. In the early years of independence, maintaining supplies of gas and electricity proved difficult amid the 1990s energy crisis. Constant electricity was not restored until 1996 amidst the chaos of the badly instigated and planned transition to a market-based economy.\nSince 2000, central Yerevan has been transformed into a vast construction site, with cranes erected all over the Kentron district. Officially, the scores of multi-storied buildings are part of large-scale urban planning projects. Roughly $1.8\u00a0billion was spent on such construction in 2006, according to the national statistical service. Prices for downtown apartments have increased by about ten times during the first decade of the 21st century. Many new streets and avenues were opened, such as the Argishti street, Italy street, Saralanj Avenue, Monte Melkonian Avenue, and Northern Avenue.\nHowever, as a result of this construction boom, the majority of the historic buildings located on the central Aram Street, were either entirely destroyed or transformed into modern residential buildings through the construction of additional floors. Only a few structures were preserved, mainly in the portion that extends between Abovyan Street and Mashtots Avenue.\nThe first major post-independence protest in Yerevan took place in September 1996, after the announcement of incumbent Levon Ter-Petrosyan's victory in the presidential election. Major opposition parties of the time, consolidated around the former Karabakh Committee member and former Prime Minister Vazgen Manukyan, organised mass demonstrations between 23 and 25 September, claiming electoral fraud by Ter-Petrosyan. An estimated of 200,000 people gathered in the Freedom Square to protest the election results. After a series of riot and violent protests around the Parliament building on 25 September, the government sent tanks and troops to Yerevan to enforce the ban on rallies and demonstrations on the following day. Prime Minister Vazgen Sargsyan and Minister of National Security Serzh Sargsyan announced on the Public Television of Armenia that their respective agencies have prevented an attempted coup d'\u00e9tat.\nIn February 2008, unrest in the capital between the authorities and opposition demonstrators led by ex-President Levon Ter-Petrosyan took place after the 2008 Armenian presidential election. The events resulted in 10 deaths and a subsequent 20-day state of emergency declared by President Robert Kocharyan.\nIn July 2016, a group of armed men calling themselves the \"Daredevils of Sassoun\" ( \"Sasna Tsrrer\") stormed a police station in Erebuni District of Yerevan, taking several hostages, demanding the release of opposition leader Jirair Sefilian and the resignation of President Serzh Sargsyan. 3 policeman were killed as a result of the attack. Many anti-government protestors held rallies in solidarity with the gunmen. However, after 2 weeks of negotiations, the crisis ended and the gunmen surrendered.\nGeography.\nTopography and cityscape.\nYerevan has an average height of , with a minimum of and a maximum of above sea level in its southwestern and northeastern sections, respectively. It is among the fifty highest cities in the world with over 1 million inhabitants.\nYerevan is located on the banks of the Hrazdan River, northeast of the Ararat Plain, in the central-western part of the country. The upper part of the city is surrounded with mountains on three sides while it descends to the banks of the river Hrazdan at the south. The Hrazdan divides Yerevan into two parts through a picturesque canyon.\nThe city is situated at the heart of the Armenian Highland. Historically, Yerevan was located in the Kotayk canton ( \"Kotayk gavar\", not to be confused with the current Kotayk Province) of the Ayrarat province of historic Armenia Major.\nAccording to the current administrative division of Armenia, Yerevan is not part of any \"marz\" (\"province\") and has special administrative status as the country's capital. It is bordered by Kotayk Province to the north and the east, Ararat Province to the south and the south-west, Armavir Province to the west and Aragatsotn Province to the north-west.\nThe Erebuni State Reserve, formed in 1981, is located around 8\u00a0km southeast of the city centre within the Erebuni District of the city. At a height between 1300 and 1450 metres above sea level, the reserve occupies an area of 120 hectares, mainly consisting of semi-deserted mountain-steppes.\nClimate.\nYerevan features a continental influenced steppe climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: \"BSk\" or \"cold semi-arid climate\", Trewartha climate classification \"BSao\"), with long, hot, dry summers and short, but cold and snowy winters. This is attributed to Yerevan being on a plain surrounded by mountains and to its distance from the sea and its moderating effects. The summers are usually very hot with the temperature in August reaching up to , and winters generally carry snowfall and freezing temperatures with January often being as cold as and lower. The amount of precipitation is small, amounting annually to about . Yerevan experiences an average of 2,700 sunshine hours per year. On 12 July 2018, Yerevan recorded a temperature of , which is the joint highest temperature to have ever been recorded in Armenia (along with Meghri city).\nArchitecture.\nThe Yerevan TV Tower is the tallest structure in the city and one of the tallest structures in the South Caucasus.\nThe Republic Square, the Yerevan Opera Theatre, and the Yerevan Cascade are among the main landmarks at the centre of Yerevan, mainly developed based on the original design of architect Alexander Tamanian, and the revised plan of architect Jim Torosyan.\nA major redevelopment process has been launched in Yerevan since 2000. As a result, many historic structures have been demolished and replaced with new buildings. This urban renewal plan has been met with opposition and criticism from some residents, as the projects destroy historic buildings dating back to the period of the Russian Empire, and often leave residents homeless. Downtown houses deemed too small are increasingly demolished and replaced by high-rise buildings.\nThe Saint Gregory Cathedral, the new building of Yerevan City Council, the new section of Matenadaran institute, the new terminal of Zvartnots International Airport, the Cafesjian Center for the Arts at the Cascade, Northern Avenue, and the new government complex of ministries are among the major construction projects fulfilled during the first two decades of the 21st century.\nAram Street of old Yerevan and the newly built Northern Avenue are respectively among the notable examples featuring the traditional and modern architectural characteristics of Yerevan.\nAs of May 2017, Yerevan is home to 4,883 residential apartment buildings, and 65,199 street lamps installed on 39,799 street light posts, covering a total length of 1,514\u00a0km. The city has 1,080 streets with a total length of 750\u00a0km.\nParks.\nYerevan is a densely built city but still offers several public parks throughout its districts, graced with mid-sized green gardens. The public park of Erebuni District along with its artificial lake is the oldest garden in the city. Occupying an area of 17 hectares, the origins of the park and the artificial lake date back to the period of king Argishti I of Urartu during the 8th century BCE. In 2011, the garden was entirely remodelled and named as Lyon Park, to become a symbol of the partnership between the cities of Lyon and Yerevan.\nThe Lovers' Park on Marshal Baghramyan Avenue and the English Park at the centre of the city, dating back to the 18th and 19th centuries respectively, are among the most popular parks in Yerevan. The Yerevan Botanical Garden (opened in 1935), the Victory Park (opened in the 1950s) and the Circular Park are among the largest green spaces of the city.\nOpened in the 1960s, the Yerevan Opera Theatre Park along with its artificial \"Swan Lake\" is also among the favourite green spaces of the city. In 2019 some of the public space of the park leased to restaurants was reclaimed allowing for improved landscape design. A public ice-skating arena is operated in the park's lake area during winters.\nThe Yerevan Lake is an artificial reservoir opened in 1967 on Hrazdan riverbed at the south of the city centre, with a surface of .\nEach administrative district of Yerevan has its own public park, such as the Buenos Aires Park and Tumanyan Park in Ajapnyak, Komitas Park in Shengavit, Vahan Zatikian Park in Malatia-Sebastia, David Anhaght Park in Kanaker-Zeytun, the Family Park in Avan, and Fridtjof Nansen Park in Nor Nork.\nPolitics and government.\nCapital.\nYerevan has been the capital of Armenia since the independence of the First Republic in 1918. Situated in the Ararat Plain, the historic lands of Armenia, it served as the best logical choice for capital of the young republic at the time.\nWhen Armenia became a republic of the Soviet Union, Yerevan remained as capital and accommodated all the political and diplomatic institutions in the republic. In 1991 with the independence of Armenia, Yerevan continued with its status as the political and cultural centre of the country, being home to all the national institutions: the Government House, the National Assembly, the Presidential Palace, the Central Bank, the Constitutional Court, all ministries, judicial bodies and other government organisations.\nMunicipality.\nYerevan received the status of a city on 1 October 1879, upon a decree issued by Tsar Alexander II of Russia. The first city council formed was headed by Hovhannes Ghorghanyan, who became the first mayor of Yerevan.\nThe Constitution of the Republic of Armenia adopted on 5 July 1995, granted Yerevan the status of a marz (\u0574\u0561\u0580\u0566, province). Therefore, Yerevan functions similarly to the provinces of Armenia with a few specifications.\nThe administrative authority of Yerevan is thus represented by:\nIn the modified Constitution of 27 November 2005, Yerevan city was turned into a \"community\" (\u0570\u0561\u0574\u0561\u0575\u0576\u0584, \"hamaynk\"); since, the Constitution declares that this community has to be led by a mayor, elected directly or indirectly, and that the city needs to be governed by a specific law. The first election of the Yerevan City Council took place in 2009 and won by the ruling Republican Party of Armenia.\nIn addition to the national police and road police, Yerevan has its own municipal police. All three bodies cooperate to maintain law in the city.\nAdministrative districts.\nYerevan is divided into twelve \"administrative districts\" (\u057e\u0561\u0580\u0579\u0561\u056f\u0561\u0576 \u0577\u0580\u057b\u0561\u0576, \"var\u010dakan \u0161r\u0135an\") each with an elected leader. The total area of the 12 districts of Yerevan is .\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;Originally a small town, Yerevan became the capital of Armenia and a large city with over one million inhabitants. Until the fall of the Soviet Union, the majority of the population of Yerevan were Armenians with minorities of Russians, Kurds, Azerbaijanis and Iranians present as well. However, with the breakout of the First Nagorno-Karabakh War from 1988 to 1994, the Azerbaijani minority diminished in the country in what was part of population exchanges between Armenia and Azerbaijan. A big part of the Russian minority also fled the country during the 1990s economic crisis in the country. Today, the population of Yerevan is overwhelmingly Armenian.\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, due to economic crises, thousands fled Armenia, mostly to Russia, North America and Europe. The population of Yerevan fell from 1,250,000 in 1989 to 1,103,488 in 2001 and to 1,091,235 in 2003. However, the population of Yerevan has been increasing since. In 2007, the capital had 1,107,800 inhabitants.\nYerevantsis in general use the Yerevan dialect, an Eastern Armenian dialect most probably formed during the 13th century. It is currently spoken in and around Yerevan, including the towns of Vagharshapat and Ashtarak. Classical Armenian (\"Grabar\") words compose a significant part of the dialect's vocabulary. Throughout the history, it was influenced by several languages, especially Russian and Persian and loan words have significant presence in it today. It is currently the most widespread Armenian dialect.\nEthnic groups.\nYerevan was inhabited first by Armenians and remained homogeneous until the 15th century. The population of the Erivan Fortress, founded in the 1580s, was mainly composed of Muslim soldiers, estimated two to three thousand. The city itself was mainly populated by Armenians. French traveler Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, who visited Yerevan possibly up to six times between 1631 and 1668, states that the city is exclusively populated by Armenians. Although much of the Armenian population of the city was deported during the 17th century, the city remained Armenian-majority during the Ottoman\u2013Hotaki War (1722\u20131727). The demographics of the region changed because of a series of wars between the Ottoman Empire, Iran and Russia. In the early 19th century Yerevan had a Muslim majority, mainly with an Armenian and \"Caucasian Tatar\" population. According to the traveler H. F. B. Lynch, the city was about 50% Armenian and 50% Muslim (Azerbaijanis and Persians) in the early 1890s.\nAfter the Armenian genocide, many refugees from what Armenians call Western Armenia (nowadays Turkey, then Ottoman Empire) escaped to Eastern Armenia. In 1919, about 75,000 Armenian refugees from the Ottoman Empire arrived in Yerevan, mostly from the Vaspurakan region (city of Van and surroundings). A significant part of these refugees died of typhus and other diseases.\nFrom 1921 to 1936, about 42,000 ethnic Armenians from Iraq, Turkey, Iran, Greece, Syria, France, Bulgaria etc. went to Soviet Armenia, with most of them settling in Yerevan. The second wave of repatriation occurred from 1946 to 1948, when about 100,000 ethnic Armenians from Iran, Syria, Lebanon, Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, Cyprus, Palestine, Iraq, Egypt, France, United States etc. moved to Soviet Armenia, again most of whom settled in Yerevan. Thus, the ethnic makeup of Yerevan became more monoethnic during the first 3 decades in the Soviet Union. The Azerbaijani population of Yerevan, who made up 43% of the population of the city prior to the October Revolution, dropped to 0.7% by 1959 and further to 0.1% by 1989, during the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.\nThere is an Indian population in Armenia, with over 22,000 residents recorded in the country. Much of this population resides in Yerevan, where a large proportion run businesses, Indian restaurants, and study in Yerevan universities.\nReligion.\nArmenian Apostolic Church.\nArmenian Apostolic Christianity is the predominant religion in Armenia. The 5th-century Saint Paul and Peter Church demolished in November 1930 by the Soviets, was among the earliest churches ever built in Erebuni-Yerevan. Many of the ancient Armenian and medieval churches of the city were destroyed by the Soviets in the 1930s during the Great Purge.\nThe regulating body of the Armenian Church in Yerevan is the Araratian Pontifical Diocese, with the Surp Sarkis Cathedral being the seat of the diocese. It is the largest diocese of the Armenian Church and one of the oldest dioceses in the world, covering the city of Yerevan and the Ararat Province of Armenia.\nYerevan is currently home to the largest Armenian church in the world, the Cathedral of Saint Gregory the Illuminator. It was consecrated in 2001, during the 1700th anniversary of the establishment of the Armenian Church and the adoption of Christianity as the national religion in Armenia.\nAs of 2017, Yerevan has 17 active Armenian churches as well as four chapels.\nRussian Orthodox Church.\nAfter the capture of Yerevan by the Russians as a result of the Russo-Persian War of 1826\u201328, many Russian Orthodox churches were built in the city under the orders of the Russian commander General Ivan Paskevich. The Saint Nikolai Cathedral opened during the second half of the 19th century, was the largest Russian church in the city. The Church of the Intercession of the Holy Mother of God was opened in 1916 in Kanaker-Zeytun.\nHowever, most of the churches were either closed or demolished by the Soviets during the 1930s. The Saint Nikolai Cathedral was entirely destroyed in 1931, while the Church of the Intercession of the Holy Mother of God was closed and converted first into a warehouse and later into a club for the military personnel. Religious services resumed in the church in 1991, and in 2004 a cupola and a belfry were added to the building. In 2010, the groundbreaking ceremony of the new Holy Cross Russian Orthodox church took place with the presence of Patriarch Kirill I of Moscow. The church was eventually consecrated on 7 October 2017, with the presence of Catholicos Karekin II, Russian bishops and the church benefactor Ara Abramyan.\nOther religions.\nAccording to Ivan Chopin, there were eight mosques in Yerevan in the middle of the 19th century. The 18th-century Blue Mosque of Yerevan was restored and reopened in the 1990s, with Iranian funding, and is currently the only active mosque in Armenia, mainly serving Iranian Shia visitors.\nYerevan is home to tiny Yezidi, Molokan, Neopagan, Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed and Jewish communities, with the Jewish community being represented by the Jewish Council of Armenia. A variety of nontrinitarian communities, considered dangerous sects by the Armenian Apostolic Church, are also found in the city, including Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormons, Seventh-day Adventists and Word of Life.\nHealth and medical care.\nYerevan is a major healthcare and medical service centre in the region. Several hospitals of Yerevan, refurbished with modern technologies, provide healthcare and conduct medical research, such as Shengavit Medical Center, Erebouni Medical Center, Izmirlian Medical Center, Saint Gregory the Illuminator Medical Center, Nork-Marash Medical Center, Armenia Republican Medical Center, Astghik Medical Center, Armenian American Wellness Center, and Mkhitar Heratsi Hospital Complex of the Yerevan State Medical University. The municipality runs 39 polyclinics/medical centres throughout the city.\nThe Research Center of Maternal and Child Health Protection has operated in Yerevan since 1937, while the Armenicum Clinical Center was opened in 1999, where research is conducted mainly related to infectious diseases, including HIV, immunodeficiency disorders and hepatitis.\nThe Liqvor Pharmaceuticals Factory, operating in Yerevan since 1991, is currently the largest medicine manufacturer of Armenia.\nCulture.\nYerevan is Armenia's principal cultural, artistic, and industrial centre, with a large number of museums, important monuments and the national public library.

Since the independence, \"Erebuni\" is mainly used for military or private flights. The Armenian Air Force has equally installed its base there and there are several MiG-29s stationed on Erebuni's tarmac.\nCity buses, public vans and trolleybuses.\nPublic transport in Yerevan is heavily privatised and mostly handled by around 60 private operators. As of May 2017, 39 city bus lines are being operated throughout Yerevan. These lines mostly consist of about 425 Bogdan, Higer City Bus and Hyundai County buses. However, the market share these buses in public transit is only about 39.1%.\nBut the 50.4% of public transit is still served by \"public vans\", locally known as marshrutka. These are about 1210 Russian-made GAZelle vans with 13 seats, that operate same way as buses, having 79 different lines with certain routes and same stops. According to Yerevan Municipality office, in future, marshrutkas should be replaced by ordinary larger buses. Despite having about 13 seats, the limit of passengers is not controlled, so usually these vans carry many more people who stand inside.\nThe Yerevan trolleybus system has been operating since 1949. Some old Soviet-era trolleybuses have been replaced with comparably new ones. As of May 2017, only 5 trolleybus lines are in operation (2.6% share), with around 45 units in service. The trolleybus system is owned and operated by the municipality.\nThe tram network that operated in Yerevan since 1906 was decommissioned in January 2004. Its operation had a cost 2.4 times higher than the generated profits, which pushed the municipality to shut down the network, despite a last-ditch effort to save it towards the end of 2003. Since the closure, the rails have been dismantled and sold.\nDue to being dispersed among dozens of private operators, the transportation is barely regulated, with only trip fee is being a subject of regulation. Thus, the quality of vehicles is often inadequate, with no certain regulations for safety. Unlike the majority of world capitals, there is no established ticketing system in Yerevan's public transportation. Passengers need to pay the money directly to the driver when getting out of the vehicle. The fare -being one of the few things that is regulated- is fixed and controlled by authorities.\nThe central station in Nor Kilikia neighbourhood serves as bus terminal for inter-city transport, serving outbound routes towards practically all the cities of Armenia as well as abroad, notably Tbilisi and Tabriz.\nUnderground.\nThe Yerevan Metro named after Karen Demirchyan, ( (\"Karen Dyemirchyani anvan Yerevani metropoliten kayaran\")) is a rapid transit system that serves the capital city since 1981. It has a single line of length with 10 active stations and 45 units in service. The interiors of the stations resemble that of the former western Soviet nations, with chandeliers hanging from the corridors. The metro stations had most of their names changed after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the independence of the Republic of Armenia.\nA northeastern extension of the line with two new stations is currently being developed. The construction of the first station (\"Ajapnyak\") and of the tunnel linking it to the rest of the network will cost US$18\u00a0million. The time of the end of the project has not yet been defined. Another long-term project is the construction of two new lines, but these have been suspended due to lack of finance.\nThe system transports more than 60,000 people on a daily basis.\nRailway.\nYerevan has a single central railway station (several railway stations of suburbs have not been used since 1990) that is connected to the metro via the \"Sasuntsi Davit\" station. The railway station is made in Soviet-style architecture with its long point on the building roof, representing the symbols of communism: red star, hammer and sickle. Due to the Turkish and Azerbaijani blockades of Armenia, there is only one international train that passes by once every two days, with neighbouring Georgia being its destination. For a sum of 9\u00a0000 to 18\u00a0000 dram, it is possible to take the night train to the Georgian capital, Tbilisi. This train then continues to its destination of Batumi, on the shores of the Black sea in the summer season.\nThe only railway that goes to Iran to the south passes by the closed border of Nakhchivan. For this reason, there are no trains that go south from Yerevan.\nDuring the first decade of the 21st century, the South Caucasus Railway CJSC \u2014 which is the current operator of the railway system in Armenia\u2014announced its readiness to put the Yerevan-Gyumri-Kars railway line in service in case the Armenian-Turkish protocols are ratified and the opening of the borders between the two countries is achieved.\nAs of July 2017, the following railway trips are scheduled from and to Yerevan:\nThe Yerevan-Ararat-Yerevan route is temporarily not in operation, while the Yerevan-Tbilisi-Yerevan route will operate starting from 2 October 2017.\nTaxi.\nYerevan prides itself on having connections 24/7 as taxis are available at any time of the day or night.

The industry of Yerevan is quite diversified including chemicals, primary metals and steel products, machinery, rubber products, plastics, rugs and carpets, textiles, clothing and footwear, jewellery, wood products and furniture, building materials and stone-processing, alcoholic beverages, mineral water, dairy product and processed food. Even though the economic crisis of the '90s ravaged the industry of the country, several factories remain always in service, notably in the petrochemical and the aluminium sectors.\nArmenian beverages, especially Armenian cognac and beer, have a worldwide fame.

{"id": "34355", "revid": "753665", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34355", "title": "Yngwie Malmsteen", "text": "Swedish-American guitarist (born 1963)\nYngwie Johan Malmsteen (; born Lars Johan Yngve Lannerb\u00e4ck, on 30 June 1963) is a Swedish-American guitarist. He first became known in the 1980s for his neoclassical playing style in heavy metal, and has released 22 studio albums in a career spanning over 40 years.\nEarly life.\nMalmsteen was born Lars Johan Yngve Lannerb\u00e4ck in Stockholm, Sweden, the third child of a musical family. In 1975, his mother reverted to her mother's (Yngwie's maternal grandmother Maud's) maiden name Malmsten, which Yngve promptly also started using as his surname. Later he slightly changed it to Malmsteen and altered his third given name Yngve to \"Yngwie\". Malmsteen played his first show on May 11, 1976 with his first band, Track on Earth, consisting of himself, his cousin Erik Lannerb\u00e4ck and a friend from school playing the drums. Later his brother Bj\u00f6rn joined on drums.\nAs a teenager he was heavily influenced by classical music, particularly 19th century Italian virtuoso violinist and composer Niccol\u00f2 Paganini as well as Johann Sebastian Bach. Yngwie Malmsteen has publicly stated that he is not influenced by the blues or the style of Ritchie Blackmore, the virtuoso claims that his guitar playing is inspired by classical violin, not classical guitar. Malmsteen has stated that Jimi Hendrix had no musical impact on him and did not contribute to his style. However watching the TV news reports on 18 September 1970 of Hendrix's death, which included footage of Hendrix smashing and burning his guitar at the Monterey Pop Festival of 1967, made Malmsteen think, \"This is really cool.\"\nCareer.\n1980s.\nFrom the late 1970s, Malmsteen played in local bands, sometimes together with future Talisman bassist Marcel Jacob, Europe bassist John Lev\u00e9n and architect Eero Koivisto. They recorded various demos and a single for CBS Records but nothing was officially released from this era until the 2002 releases of Rising Force - Birth of the Sun and Yngwie's own The Genesis album.\nIn early 1982, Mike Varney of Shrapnel Records first heard Yngwie Malmsteen's music through record store owner Bill Burkard, who played for him a demo tape of Malmsteen's early work (likely the 1978 \"Powerhouse\" demo) recorded when Yngwie was 15. Later in 1982, Malmsteen sent to Varney an untitled demo recording as a submission for Varney's \"Guitar Player\" magazine column. \"Guitar Player\" published this demo for the February 1983 edition of the magazine.\nIn 1983, Varney brought Malmsteen to the United States to play on the recording of Shrapnel recording artist Steeler, also featuring singer Ron Keel and bassist Rik Fox for its self-titled album. He then appeared with Graham Bonnet in the band Alcatrazz, playing on its 1983 debut \"No Parole from Rock 'n' Roll\" and the 1984 live album \"Live Sentence\". Bonnet and Malmsteen clashed about who was the frontman and had a fight during a show. Malmsteen was fired on the spot from Alcatrazz and replaced by Steve Vai. Vai had one day to learn the songs for the ongoing tour.\nIn 1984, Malmsteen released his first solo album \"Rising Force\", which featured Barrie Barlow of Jethro Tull on drums and keyboard player Jens Johansson. His album was meant to be an instrumental side-project of Alcatrazz, but it ended up featuring vocals by Jeff Scott Soto and Malmsteen was fired from Alcatrazz in July 1984 before the release of \"Rising Force\".\n\"Rising Force\" won \"Guitar Players award for Best Rock Album and was nominated for a Grammy Award for 'Best Rock Instrumental', reaching no. 60 on the \"Billboard\" album chart. Yngwie J. Malmsteen's Rising Force (as his band was thereafter known) next released \"Marching Out\" (1985). Then he recruited Jens Johansson's brother Anders to play drums and bassist Marcel Jacob to record and tour with the band. Jacob left in the middle of a tour and was replaced by Wally Voss. Malmsteen's third album, \"Trilogy\", featuring the vocals of Mark Boals (and Malmsteen on both guitar and bass), was released in 1986. Boals left the band in the middle of the tour and was replaced by the former singer Jeff Scott Soto. The tour was cancelled after Malmsteen was involved in a serious car accident, smashing his V12 Jaguar E-Type into a tree, which put him in a coma for a week. Nerve damage to his right hand was reported. During this time, Malmsteen's mother died from cancer. New line-up changes for the next album included former Rainbow vocalist Joe Lynn Turner joining the band, along with session bassist Bob Daisley, who was hired to record some bass parts and help with the lyrics. In April 1988, he released his fourth album \"Odyssey\". \"Odyssey\" was his most successful album, in part due to the success of its first single \"Heaven Tonight\". Shows in the Soviet Union during the Odyssey tour were recorded and released in 1989 as a fifth album '. The classic Rising Force line-up with Malmsteen and the Johansson brothers was dissolved in 1989 when both Anders and Jens left. That year later, Jens joined Dio replacing keyboardist Claude Schnell.\nMalmsteen's neoclassical style of metal became popular among hordes of guitarists during the mid-1980s, with contemporaries such as Jason Becker, Marty Friedman, Paul Gilbert, Tony MacAlpine, and Vinnie Moore becoming prominent. In late 1988, Malmsteen's signature Fender Stratocaster guitar was released, making him and Eric Clapton the first artists to be honored by Fender.\n1990s.\nIn the early 1990s, Malmsteen released two albums, \"Eclipse\" (1990) and \"Fire &amp; Ice\" (1992), with the singer G\u00f6ran Edman (ex-Madison and Vinnie Vincent Invasion), followed by \"The Seventh Sign\" (1994) and \"Magnum Opus\" (1995) with former Loudness singer Mike Vescera. Despite his early and continuous success in Europe and Asia, by the early 1990s heavy metal styles such as neoclassical metal and shredding had gone out of fashion in the US.\nAround 1993, Malmsteen's future mother-in-law \u2013 who opposed his engagement to her daughter \u2013 had him arrested for allegedly holding her daughter hostage with a gun. The charges were later dropped. Malmsteen continued to record and release albums under the Japanese record label Pony Canyon and maintained a devoted following with fans in Europe and Japan and to a lesser extent in the US.\nIn the mid 1990s, Malmsteen released the albums \"Inspiration\" (1996) featuring three of his former singers Soto, Boals and Turner, \"Facing the Animal\" (1997) featuring Mats Lev\u00e9n on vocals and Cozy Powell on drums, followed by a live record \"Double Live!\" (1998) and another studio recording \"Alchemy\" (1999) featuring once again Mark Boals on vocals.\nSpecial guest appearances and side projects.\nIn 1996, Malmsteen joined forces with former band members Jeff Scott Soto and Marcel Jacob on the album \"Human Clay\" where he played lead guitar on the track \"Jealousy\". In the same year, Malmsteen recorded guitar solos for two different Deep Purple tribute albums, \"Smoke on the Water\" and \"Black Night \u2013 Deep Purple Tribute According to New York\", using the alias \"Lars Y. Loudamp\" on the latter to avoid contractual conflicts. He also guested with Saxon on the song \"Denim And Leather\" on their live album \"The Eagle Has Landed \u2013 Part II\" (released in 1997). Later that year, Malmsteen recorded the tracks \"Enigma suite\" and \"All opposable thumbs\" with his former band members Jens Johansson and Anders Johansson on their album \"Johansson/Sonic Winter\".\n2000s.\nIn 2000, he signed a contract with the US record label Spitfire and released his 1990s catalog on the US market for the first time, including what he regards as his masterpiece, \"Concerto Suite for Electric Guitar and Orchestra\", recorded with the Czech Philharmonic in Prague.\nAfter the release of \"War to End All Wars\" in 2000, singer Mark Boals left the band. He was replaced by former Rainbow vocalist Doogie White, whose vocals were well received by fans. In 2003, Malmsteen joined Joe Satriani and Steve Vai as part of the G3 supergroup, a tour showcasing guitar performances. Malmsteen made two guest appearances on keyboardist Derek Sherinian's albums \"Black Utopia\" (2003) and \"Blood of the Snake\" (2006), where Malmsteen plays on the same tracks as Al Di Meola and Zakk Wylde. In 2004, Malmsteen made two cameo appearances on \"Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law\". In 2005 \"Unleash the Fury\" was released through Spitfire Records. As stated in an issue of \"Guitar World\" magazine, he titled this album after an infamous 'airline incident', which occurred on a flight to Japan during a 1988 tour. He was drunk and behaving obnoxiously, until he fell asleep and was roused by a woman pouring a jug of iced water on him. Enraged, he shouted, \"You've released the fucking fury!\" The audio from this incident was caught on tape by a fellow band member. Malmsteen says that the name of the album refers to both the energy of the album and the incident. The release of \"Unleash the Fury\" was followed by a DVD release of \"Concerto Suite For Electric Guitar And Orchestra in E Flat Minor, Op. 1 \u2013 With The New Japan Philharmonic Live\". The DVD chronicles Malmsteen's first time playing in front of a live audience with an orchestra, an experience that he describes as \"fun but also extremely scary\".\nIn 2007, Malmsteen was honored in the Xbox 360 version of \"Guitar Hero II\". Players can receive the \"Yngwie Malmsteen\" award by hitting 1000 or more notes in succession. February 2008 saw the replacement of singer Doogie White with former Iced Earth and Judas Priest and current Beyond Fear singer Tim \"Ripper\" Owens, with whom Malmsteen had once recorded a cover of Ozzy Osbourne's song \"Mr. Crowley\", for the 2000 Osbourne tribute album \"Bat Head Soup: A Tribute to Ozzy\". The first Malmsteen album to feature Owens is titled \"Perpetual Flame\" and was released on 4 October. On 25 November 2008, Malmsteen had three of his songs (\"Caprici Di Diablo\", \"Damnation Game\", and \"Red Devil\", all from this latter album) released as downloadable content for the video games \"Rock Band\" and \"Rock Band 2\", and later for \"Rock Band 3\".\nIn 2008, Malmsteen was a special guest on the VH1 Classic show \"That Metal Show\". On 10 March 2009, Malmsteen's label Rising Force released \"Angels of Love\", an all-instrumental album, which featured acoustic arrangements of some of his best-known ballads.

On 6 August 2011, Malmsteen made another appearance in the United States, playing a rendition of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" before a game between the St. Louis Cardinals and Florida Marlins at Sun Life Stadium.

On 5 December 2012, Malmsteen released the album \"Spellbound\". 2013 saw the release of Yngwie's official autobiography \"Relentless\".\nOn 12 June 2014, Malmsteen kicked off his \"Guitar Gods 2014 Tour\" at the F.M.

As Malmsteen was quoted: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I've been asked to do a blues album for the last 30 years [...] this time I finally said, \"Sure, why not? Let's try it!\" I just didn't want to be stuck in the standard, pentatonic, play a 12-bar thing. I didn't want to do that.\nOn 8 May 2021, Yngwie Malmsteen was reported to have launched the \"Parabellum\" album and video for the \"Paganini-referencing\" track \"Wolves at the Door\". Since COVID-19 restrictions prevented touring, Malmsteen had more time to record the album, and was \"clearly delighted with the results.\"\nOn 17 July 2023, Yngwie Malmsteen announced his first-ever interactive video guitar masterclass on TrueFire.

But I don't dwell on them. I don't expect people to understand me, because I'm pretty complex, and I think outside the box with everything I do. I've always taken the untraveled path. Obviously, people have their opinions, but I can't get too wrapped up in that, because I know what I can do, and I know what kind of person I am. And I have no control over what anybody says about me. Back in Sweden, I'm 'Mr Personality' in the tabloids, but obviously I can't take that seriously. I know in my heart that if I do the absolute best I can do, maybe ten years from now people may turn around and say, 'he wasn't that bad'.\"\nIn August 2009, \"Time\" magazine included Malmsteen on its list of the 10 best electric guitar players of all time. Malmsteen's listing, however, appeared to be sardonic, as the article concluded that: \"The Swede's superfast 'neoclassical' style \u2013 he credits Bach and Paganini as influences \u2013 is a blur of scales and technical precision. It almost makes you forget that the great bulk of his music is so fast that it's unlistenable.\"\nEquipment.\nYngwie Malmsteen Signature Stratocaster.\nMalmsteen has been a longtime user of Fender Stratocasters with DiMarzio HS3 single-coil pickups \"for playing at blistering volume with no hum or screechiness\". His most famous Stratocaster is his 1972 blonde Stratocaster, nicknamed \"The Duck\" because of its yellow finish and the Donald Duck stickers on the headstock. An alternative nickname for this guitar is \"Play Loud\" due to a sticker that Anders Johansson put on the upper horn of the guitar in Rockshire studios in 1984. Fender made 100 replica copies of this guitar and marketed it as the \"Play Loud Guitar\". He also has a Fender Yngwie Malmsteen Signature Stratocaster since 1986. It comes in a Vintage White finish with a maple neck, either a maple or rosewood scalloped fretboard and, from 2010, Seymour Duncan STK-S10 YJM \"Fury\" Model pickups. There is also a signature YJM100 Marshall amplifier, based on the \"1959\" amplifier range.\nOther equipment.\nBesides Stratocasters, Malmsteen has played and appeared in ads for non-Fender guitars (like Aria Pro II and Schecter in the early 1980s) and played non-Strat-shaped guitars (like Gibson Flying Vs), early in his career.\nToday, for acoustic and nylon string guitars, Malmsteen uses his signature Ovation YM68s. Malmsteen uses light-gauge strings on his guitars, stringing his 25-1/2\" scale instruments with his signature string sets by Fender (gauges: .08, .011, .014, .022w, .032, .046 and .08, .011, .014, .026, .036, .048) and pairing them with Dunlop Delrin 500 series guitar picks.\nBand members.\nCurrent members\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Johnson. It is a lookahead left-to-right rightmost derivation (LALR) parser generator, generating a LALR parser (the part of a compiler that tries to make syntactic sense of the source code) based on a formal grammar, written in a notation similar to Backus\u2013Naur form (BNF). Yacc is supplied as a standard utility on BSD and AT&amp;T Unix. GNU-based Linux distributions include Bison, a forward-compatible Yacc replacement.\nHistory.\nIn the early 1970s, Stephen C. Johnson, a computer scientist at Bell Labs / AT&amp;T, developed Yacc because he wanted to insert an exclusive or operator into a B language compiler (developed using McIlroy's TMG compiler-compiler), but it turned out to be a hard task. As a result, he was directed by his colleague at Bell Labs Al Aho to Donald Knuth's work on LR parsing, which served as the basis for Yacc. Yacc was influenced by and received its name in reference to TMG compiler-compiler.\nYacc was originally written in the B programming language, but was soon rewritten in C by Alan Snyder. It appeared as part of Version 3 Unix, and a full description of Yacc was published in 1975.\nJohnson used Yacc to create the Portable C Compiler. Bjarne Stroustrup also attempted to use Yacc to create a formal specification of C++, but \"was defeated by C's syntax\". While finding it unsuitable for a formal specification of the language, Stroustrup did proceed to use Yacc to implement Cfront, the first implementation of C++.\nIn a 2008 interview, Johnson reflected that \"the contribution Yacc made to the spread of Unix and C is what I'm proudest of\".\nDescription.\nThe input to Yacc is a grammar with snippets of C code (called \"actions\") attached to its rules. Its output is a shift-reduce parser in C that executes the C snippets associated with each rule as soon as the rule is recognized. Typical actions involve the construction of parse trees. Using an example from Johnson, if the call node(label, left, right) constructs a binary parse tree node with the specified label and children, then the rule\nrecognizes summation expressions and constructs nodes for them. The special identifiers $$, $1 and $3 refer to items on the parser's stack.\nYacc produces only a parser (phrase analyzer) which can be used alone in the case of scannerless parsing however, full syntactic analysis typically requires an external lexical analyzer to perform a tokenization stage first (word analysis), which is then followed by the parsing stage proper. Lexical analyzer generators, such as Lex or Flex, are widely available for this purpose. The IEEE POSIX P1003.2 standard defines the functionality and requirements for both Lex and Yacc.\nSome versions of AT&amp;T Yacc have become open source. For example, source code is available with the standard distributions of Plan 9.\nImpact.\nYacc and similar programs (largely reimplementations) have been very popular. Yacc itself used to be available as the default parser generator on most Unix systems, though it has since been supplanted by more recent, largely compatible, programs such as Berkeley Yacc, GNU Bison, MKS Yacc, and Abraxas PCYACC. An updated version of the original AT&amp;T Yacc is included as part of Sun's OpenSolaris project. Each offers slight improvements and additional features over the original Yacc, but the concept and basic syntax have remained the same.\nYacc was also one of several UNIX tools available for Charles River Data Systems' UNOS operating system under Bell Laboratories license.\nAmong the languages that were first implemented with Yacc are AWK, C++, eqn and Pic. Yacc was also used on Unix to implement the Portable C Compiler, as well as parsers for such programming languages as FORTRAN 77, Ratfor, APL, bc, m4, etc.\nYacc has also been rewritten for other languages, including OCaml, Ratfor, ML, Ada, Pascal, Java, PHP, Python, Ruby, Go, Common Lisp and Erlang.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nShell and Utilities Reference, The Single UNIX Specification, Version 5 from The Open Group"}
{"id": "34359", "revid": "27015025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34359", "title": "Yoneda lemma", "text": "Embedding of categories into functor categories\nIn mathematics, the Yoneda lemma is a fundamental result in category theory. It is an abstract result on functors of the type \"morphisms into a fixed object\". It is a vast generalisation of Cayley's theorem from group theory (viewing a group as a miniature category with just one object and only isomorphisms). It also generalizes the information-preserving relation between a term and its continuation-passing style transformation from programming language theory. It allows the embedding of any locally small category into a category of functors (contravariant set-valued functors) defined on that category. It also clarifies how the embedded category of representable functors and their natural transformations relates to the other objects in the larger functor category. It is an important tool that underlies several modern developments in algebraic geometry and representation theory. It is named after Nobuo Yoneda.\nGeneralities.\nThe Yoneda lemma suggests that instead of studying the locally small category formula_1, one should study the category of all functors of formula_1 into formula_3 (the category of sets with functions as morphisms). formula_3 is a category we think we understand well, and a functor of formula_1 into formula_3 can be seen as a \"representation\" of formula_1 in terms of known structures. The original category formula_1 is contained in this functor category, but new objects appear in the functor category, which were absent and \"hidden\" in formula_1. Treating these new objects just like the old ones often unifies and simplifies the theory.\nThis approach is akin to (and in fact generalizes) the common method of studying a ring by investigating the modules over that ring. The ring takes the place of the category formula_1, and the category of modules over the ring is a category of functors defined on formula_1.\nFormal statement.\nYoneda's lemma concerns functors from a fixed category formula_1 to a category of sets, formula_3. If formula_1 is a locally small category (i.e. the hom-sets are actual sets and not proper classes), then each object formula_15 of formula_1 gives rise to a functor to formula_3 called a hom-functor. This functor is denoted:\nformula_18.\nThe (covariant) hom-functor formula_19 sends formula_20 to the set of morphisms formula_21 and sends a morphism formula_22 (where formula_23) to the morphism formula_24 (composition with formula_25 on the left) that sends a morphism formula_26 in formula_21 to the morphism formula_28 in formula_29. That is,\n formula_30\n formula_31\nYoneda's lemma says that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_theorem/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLemma\u00a0(Yoneda)\u2014Let formula_32 be a functor from a locally small category formula_1 to formula_3. Then for each object formula_15 of formula_1, the natural transformations formula_37 from formula_19 to formula_32 are in one-to-one correspondence with the elements of formula_40; rather intuitively, there exists a bijection between formula_41 and formula_42. That is,\nformula_43\nMoreover, this isomorphism is natural in formula_44 and formula_45 when both sides are regarded as functors from formula_46 to formula_3.\nHere the notation formula_48 denotes the category of functors from formula_1 to formula_3.\nGiven a natural transformation formula_51 from formula_52 to formula_45, the corresponding element of formula_42 is formula_55; and given an element formula_56 of formula_42, the corresponding natural transformation is given by formula_58 which assigns to a morphism formula_59 a value of formula_60.\nContravariant version.\nThere is a contravariant version of Yoneda's lemma, which concerns contravariant functors from formula_1 to formula_3. This version involves the contravariant hom-functor\nformula_63\nwhich sends formula_64 to the hom-set formula_65. Given an arbitrary contravariant functor formula_66 from formula_1 to formula_3, Yoneda's lemma asserts that\nformula_69\nNaturality.\nThe bijections provided in the (covariant) Yoneda lemma (for each formula_44 and formula_45) are the components of a natural isomorphism between two certain functors from formula_46 to formula_3. One of the two functors is the evaluation functor\nformula_74\nformula_75\nthat sends a pair formula_76 of a morphism formula_77 in formula_78 and a natural transformation formula_79 to the map\nformula_80\nThis is enough to determine the other functor since we know what the natural isomorphism is. Under the second functor\nformula_81\nformula_82\nthe image of a pair formula_76 is the map\nformula_84\nthat sends a natural transformation formula_85 to the natural transformation formula_86, whose components are\nformula_87\nNaming conventions.\nThe use of formula_19 for the covariant hom-functor and formula_89 for the contravariant hom-functor is not completely standard. Many texts and articles either use the opposite convention or completely unrelated symbols for these two functors. However, most modern algebraic geometry texts starting with Alexander Grothendieck's foundational EGA use the convention in this article.\nThe mnemonic \"falling into something\" can be helpful in remembering that formula_19 is the covariant hom-functor. When the letter formula_15 is falling (i.e. a subscript), formula_19 assigns to an object formula_64 the morphisms from formula_15 into formula_64.\nProof.\nSince formula_96 is a natural transformation, we have the following commutative diagram:\nThis diagram shows that the natural transformation formula_97 is completely determined by formula_98 since for each morphism formula_99 one has\nformula_100\nMoreover, any element formula_101 defines a natural transformation in this way. The proof in the contravariant case is completely analogous.\nThe Yoneda embedding.\nAn important special case of Yoneda's lemma is when the functor formula_45 from formula_1 to formula_3 is another hom-functor formula_105. In this case, the covariant version of Yoneda's lemma states that\nformula_106\nThat is, natural transformations between hom-functors are in one-to-one correspondence with morphisms (in the reverse direction) between the associated objects. Given a morphism formula_107 the associated natural transformation is denoted formula_108.\nMapping each object formula_15 in formula_1 to its associated hom-functor formula_111 and each morphism formula_107 to the corresponding natural transformation formula_113 determines a contravariant functor formula_114 from formula_1 to formula_48, the functor category of all (covariant) functors from formula_1 to formula_3. One can interpret formula_114 as a covariant functor:\nformula_120\nThe meaning of Yoneda's lemma in this setting is that the functor formula_121 is fully faithful, and therefore gives an embedding of formula_122 in the category of functors to formula_3. The collection of all functors formula_124 is a subcategory of formula_125. Therefore, Yoneda embedding implies that the category formula_122 is isomorphic to the category formula_127.\nThe contravariant version of Yoneda's lemma states that\nformula_128\nTherefore, formula_129 gives rise to a covariant functor from formula_1 to the category of contravariant functors to formula_3:\nformula_132\nYoneda's lemma then states that any locally small category formula_1 can be embedded in the category of contravariant functors from formula_1 to formula_3 via formula_136. This is called the \"Yoneda embedding\".\nThe Yoneda embedding is sometimes denoted by \u3088, the hiragana Yo.\nRepresentable functor.\nThe Yoneda embedding essentially states that for every (locally small) category, objects in that category can be represented by presheaves, in a full and faithful manner. That is,\nformula_137\nfor a presheaf \"P\". Many common categories are, in fact, categories of pre-sheaves, and on closer inspection, prove to be categories of sheaves, and as such examples are commonly topological in nature, they can be seen to be topoi in general. The Yoneda lemma provides a point of leverage by which the topological structure of a category can be studied and understood.\nIn terms of (co)end calculus.\nGiven two categories formula_138 and formula_139 with two functors formula_140, natural transformations between them can be written as the following end.\nformula_141\nFor any functors formula_142 and formula_143 the following formulas are all formulations of the Yoneda lemma.\nformula_144\nformula_145\nPreadditive categories, rings and modules.\nA \"preadditive category\" is a category where the morphism sets form abelian groups and the composition of morphisms is bilinear; examples are categories of abelian groups or modules. In a preadditive category, there is both a \"multiplication\" and an \"addition\" of morphisms, which is why preadditive categories are viewed as generalizations of rings. Rings are preadditive categories with one object.\nThe Yoneda lemma remains true for preadditive categories if we choose as our extension the category of \"additive\" contravariant functors from the original category into the category of abelian groups; these are functors which are compatible with the addition of morphisms and should be thought of as forming a \"module category\" over the original category. The Yoneda lemma then yields the natural procedure to enlarge a preadditive category so that the enlarged version remains preadditive \u2014 in fact, the enlarged version is an abelian category, a much more powerful condition. In the case of a ring formula_146, the extended category is the category of all right modules over formula_146, and the statement of the Yoneda lemma reduces to the well-known isomorphism\nformula_148\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0for all right modules formula_149 over formula_146.\nRelationship to Cayley's theorem.\nAs stated above, the Yoneda lemma may be considered as a vast generalization of Cayley's theorem from group theory. To see this, let formula_1 be a category with a single object formula_152 such that every morphism is an isomorphism (i.e. a groupoid with one object). Then formula_153 forms a group under the operation of composition, and any group can be realized as a category in this way.\nIn this context, a covariant functor formula_154 consists of a set formula_155 and a group homomorphism formula_156, where formula_157 is the group of permutations of formula_155; in other words, formula_155 is a G-set. A natural transformation between such functors is the same thing as an equivariant map between formula_160-sets: a set function formula_161 with the property that formula_162 for all formula_26 in formula_160 and formula_165 in formula_155. (On the left side of this equation, the formula_167 denotes the action of formula_160 on formula_155, and on the right side the action on formula_170.)\nNow the covariant hom-functor formula_171 corresponds to the action of formula_160 on itself by left-multiplication (the contravariant version corresponds to right-multiplication). The Yoneda lemma with formula_173 states that\nformula_174,\nthat is, the equivariant maps from this formula_160-set to itself are in bijection with formula_160. But it is easy to see that (1) these maps form a group under composition, which is a subgroup of formula_177, and (2) the function which gives the bijection is a group homomorphism. (Going in the reverse direction, it associates to every formula_26 in formula_160 the equivariant map of right-multiplication by formula_26.) Thus formula_160 is isomorphic to a subgroup of formula_177, which is the statement of Cayley's theorem.\nHistory.\nYoshiki Kinoshita stated in 1996 that the term \"Yoneda lemma\" was coined by Saunders Mac Lane following an interview he had with Yoneda in the Gare du Nord station.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His presidency oversaw a civil war in East Pakistan, resulting in Bangladesh's secession. He also served as the fifth commander-in-chief of the Pakistan Army from 1966 to 1971.\nA Pathan of Punjab, Khan was commissioned into the British Indian Army in 1939 and fought in the Second World War in the Mediterranean theatre. Following the Partition of British India, he joined the Pakistan Army and organized the Staff College, Quetta. In 1965, he played a vital role in executing Operation Grand Slam in Indian-administered Kashmir during the Second India\u2013Pakistan War and was assigned to assume the army command in October 1966 by President Ayub Khan. In the wake of the 1968\u20131969 Pakistani protests, Ayub Khan resigned and transferred his authority to Yahya Khan.\nKhan's presidency oversaw martial law by suspending the constitution in 1969. Holding the country's first general election in 1970, he barred power transition to the victorious Sheikh Mujibur Rahman from East Pakistan, leading to mass protests in the provincial wing and a call for sovereignty. On 25 March 1971, Khan ordered Operation Searchlight in an effort to suppress Bengali nationalism, which led to the Bangladesh Liberation War. Khan is considered a chief architect of the Bangladesh genocide along with his deputies Hamid Khan and Tikka Khan. In December 1971, Pakistan carried out unsuccessful pre-emptive strikes against the Bengali-allied Indian Army, culminating in the start of the Third India\u2013Pakistan War. The wars resulted in the surrender of Pakistani forces and East Pakistan succeeded as Bangladesh, after which Yahya Khan resigned from the army command and transferred the presidency to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Khan remained under house surveillance prior to 1979 when he was released by Fazle Haq. Khan died the following year in Rawalpindi and was buried in Peshawar.\nKhan's short regime is widely seen as a key factor in the breakup of Pakistan. His refusal to transfer power to the Awami League, despite their electoral victory in East Pakistan, led to political turmoil. This culminated in Operation Searchlight, a brutal military crackdown that resulted in the Bengali genocide, causing widespread death and displacement. Khan is viewed negatively in both Bangladesh, where he is seen as the architect of the genocide, and Pakistan, where his failure to prevent the country's disintegration is considered a national tragedy.\nEarly life and education.\nAgha Muhammad Yahya Khan was born on 4 February 1917 in the town of Chakwal, Punjab, British India. His family were written to be of Pashtun as well as Qizilbash origin and were descended from the elite soldiers of Iranian conqueror Nader Shah (r.\u20091736\u00a0\u2013\u00a01747). Yahya Khan also spoke Persian. &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Few Pakistanis knew anything about Yahya Khan when he was vaulted into the presidency two years ago. The stocky, bushy\u2013browed Pathan had been the army chief of staff since 1966... Yahya (pronounced Ya-hee-uh) Khan claims direct descent from warrior nobles who fought in the elite armies of Nader Shah, the Persian adventurer who conquered Delhi in the 18th century.\u2014\u200aAccording to Indian journalist Dewan Barindranath's book \"Private Life of Yahya Khan\" (published in 1974), Yahya's father, Saadat Ali Khan, worked in the Indian Imperial Police, in the Punjab province. He joined as a head constable and retired as a deputy superintendent. He was posted in Chakwal when Yahya Khan was born. Saadat was rewarded with the title of Khan Sahib for having disposed of the bodies of many independence activists, including Bhagat Singh, as they were executed in secrecy and the colonial authorities wanted to dispose of the corpses without attracting much attention, operations Saadat Ali Khan carried out \"efficiently and faithfully.\"\nYahya's father was originally from Peshawar. Their family house, built in 1890, is located in the Muhallah Shaikh Ul Islam street of Ganj area in Peshawar's Walled City, once serving as the main administrative area. Yahya studied in the prestigious Colonel Brown Cambridge School in Dehradun and later enrolled at the University of the Punjab in Lahore, from where he graduated with a B.A. degree, finishing first in his class.\nMilitary service (1939-1969).\nCareer before creation of Pakistan.\nYahya Khan was commissioned into the British Indian Army from the Indian Military Academy, Dehradun on 15 July 1939, his date of commission was later antedated to 28 August 1938. An infantry officer from the 4th/10th Baluch Regiment (4th Battalion of 10th Baluch Regiment, later amalgamated with the modern and current form of Baloch Regiment, 'Baloch' was spelled as 'Baluch' in Yahya's time), Yahya saw action during World War II in North Africa where he was captured by the Axis Forces in June 1942 and interned in a prisoner of war camp in Italy from where he escaped in the third attempt.\nYahya Khan served in World War II as a lieutenant and later captain in the 4th Infantry Division (India). He served in Iraq, Italy and North Africa.\nAfter the creation of Pakistan.\nAfter the partition of India, he decided to join the Pakistan Army in August 1947, he had already reached the rank of major (acting lieutenant-colonel). In this year, he was instrumental in not letting the Indian officers shift books from the famous library of the Staff College, Quetta where Yahya was posted as an instructor at the time of the partition. He renamed the 'Command and Staff College' from 'Army Staff College'. At the age of 34, he was promoted to Brigadier, then the youngest Brigadier of Pakistan. And then he was appointed as commander of the 105th Independent Brigade that was deployed in LoC ceasefire region in Jammu and Kashmir in 1951\u20131952.\nLater Yahya Khan, as Vice Chief of General Staff, was selected to head of the army's planning board set up by General Ayub Khan to modernize the Pakistan Army in 1954\u201357. Yahya also performed the duties of Chief of General Staff from 1957 to 1962 from where he went on to command two infantry divisions from 1962 to 1965. He played a pivotal role in sustaining the support for President Ayub Khan's campaign in the 1965 presidential elections against Fatima Jinnah. He was made GOC of the 7th Infantry Division of the Pakistan Army, which he commanded during the 1965 war with India.\nDuring these years, Yahya was also tasked in civil and administrative matters, including being the Administrator of the Islamabad Capital Project, \"the job for major execution\" being given to him.\nThe C-in-C of the Army.\nYahya became Pakistan Army's C-in-C on 27 October 1966 when General Mohammad Musa went on retirement. When Yahya became the C-in-C, he superseded two of his seniors: Lieutenant-General Altaf Qadir and Lieutenant-General Bakhtiar Rana.\nAfter becoming the commander-in-chief of the army, Yahya energetically started reorganizing the Pakistan Army in 1966. The post-1965 situation saw major organizational and technical changes in the Pakistan Army. Until 1965, it was thought that divisions could function effectively while getting orders directly from the army's GHQ. This idea failed miserably in the 1965 war, and the need to have intermediate corps headquarters in between the GHQ and the fighting combat divisions was recognized as a foremost operational necessity after the 1965 war. In the 1965 war, the Pakistan Army had only one corps headquarters (the 1 Corps).\nSoon after the war had started, the United States had imposed an embargo on military aid to both India and Pakistan. This embargo did not affect the Indian Army but produced major changes in the Pakistan Army's technical composition. US Secretary of State Dean Rusk well summed it up when he said, \"Well if you are going to fight, go ahead and fight, but we're not going to pay for it\".\nPakistan now turned to China for military aid, and the Chinese tank T-59 started replacing the US M-47/48 tanks as the Pakistan Army's MBT (Main Battle Tank) from 1966. 80 tanks, the first batch of T-59s, a low-grade version of the Russian T-54/55 series were delivered to Pakistan in 1965\u201366. The first batch was displayed in the Joint Services Day Parade on 23 March 1966. The 1965 War had proved that Pakistan Army's tank-infantry ratio was lopsided and more infantry was required. Three more infantry divisions (9, 16 and 17 Divisions) largely equipped with Chinese equipment and popularly referred to by the rank and file as \"The China Divisions\" were raised by the beginning of 1968. Two more corps headquarters: the 2 Corps Headquarters (Jhelum-Ravi Corridor) and the 4 Corps Headquarters (Ravi-Sutlej Corridor) were raised, also in East Pakistan a corps-sized formation (which was titled as the Eastern Command) was created.\nPresidency (1969\u20131971).\nA sustained anti-regime mass movement began in the fall of 1968 in West Pakistan. The uprising spread to East Pakistan and gathered strength, adding to a tense political climate that had worsened following President Ayub Khan's implementation of the 1966 Tashkent Agreement and sacking of Foreign Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Ayub Khan tried to quell the revolt by making concessions to opposition groups including the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and the Awami League (AL), but demonstrations continued.\nRather than resigning and allowing a constitutional transfer of power, Ayub Khan requested that Yahya Khan, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, utilize the military's supra-constitutional authority to declare martial law and take power. On 24 March 1969, Ayub directed a letter to Yahya inviting him to deal with the crisis, as it was \"beyond the capacity of [civil] government to deal with the... complex situation.\" Some sources claim Yahya accepted Ayub's proposal on 25 March. On 26 March 1969, General Yahya appeared on national television and announced a state of martial law throughout the entirety of the country. The 1962 constitution was abrogated, the parliament was dissolved, and Ayub's civilian officials were dismissed. In his first nationwide address, Yahya maintained, \"I will not tolerate disorder, let everyone remain at his post.\"\nYahya Khan's new military government featured several active duty military officials:\nWhen Yahya Khan assumed the office on 25 March, he inherited a two-decade constitutional problem of inter-provincial ethnic rivalry between West Pakistan, which was almost exclusively Muslim and was dominated by the Punjabi-Pashtun-Mohajir peoples, and East Pakistan, whose population was largely ethnically Bengali and approximately three-fourths Muslim (as of the 1961 Census). In addition, Yahya also inherited the challenge of transforming a country essentially ruled by one man into a democratic country, which was the ideological basis of the anti-Ayub movement of 1968\u201369. Once in office, Yahya Khan was tasked with leading the country, drafting of a provisional constitution, resolving the One Unit question, and satisfying the frustrations and the sense of exploitation stirring in the \"East Wing\" (East Pakistan) by government policies since 1948.\nThe American political scientist Lawrence Ziring observed:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Yahya Khan has been widely portrayed as a ruthless uncompromising insensitive and grossly inept leader... While Yahya cannot escape responsibility for these tragic events, it is also on the record that he did not act alone... All the major actors of the period were creatures of a historic legacy and a psycho-political milieu which did not lend itself to accommodation and compromise, to bargaining and a reasoned settlement. Nurtured on conspiracy theories, they were all conditioned to act in a manner that neglected agreeable solutions and promoted violent judgments.\nYahya Khan attempted to solve Pakistan's constitutional and inter-provincial rivalry problems once he took over power from Ayub Khan in March 1969. His earlier initiatives were directed at establishing the National Security Council (NSC), with Major-General Ghulam Omar as its first advisor. It was formed to analyse and prepare assessments towards issues of political and national security.\nM.M. Ahmad, then Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission of Pakistan told Henry Kissinger that the state \"had now realized that it would have to sacrifice some of its economic growth rate for the sake of social reform and of meeting the problem of disparity in the allocation of resources\" between the two wings, and noted that the loss of direct US military aid meant \"Pakistan had had to cut back resources devoted to the development budget in order to finance the procurement of military equipment.\" In 1971, Yahya conceded that he had failed to improve the national economy, \u201cI inherited a bad economy, and I am going to pass it on,\u201d he noted. The military government-initiated talks with the International Monetary Fund after foreign reserves fell to $160 million. In 1968, Muhajirs from East Pakistan started Muhjairland movement for a separated province. However, Yahya Khan rejected the idea saying it would not bring them solution.\nIn 1969, President Yahya also promulgated the Legal Framework Order, 1970, which disestablished the One Unit Scheme that had formed West Pakistan and returned the provinces of West Pakistan to their pre-1955 configuration. The decree had no effect on East Pakistan. However, the dissolution of the One Unit policy did not lead to the positive results that it might have yielded if withdrawn earlier. Yahya also made an attempt to accommodate the East Pakistanis by abolishing the principle of parity, in the hope that a greater share in the assembly would redress their wounded ethnic regional pride and ensure the integrity of Pakistan. Instead of satisfying the Bengalis, it intensified their vocalness for separatism, causing a further rise in anti-West Wing sentiment in the East Wing.\n1970 general election.\nBy 28 July 1969, President Yahya Khan had set a framework for elections that were to be held in December 1970, with Judge Abdus Sattar appointed as Chief Election Commissioner of the Election Commission of Pakistan. On 7 December, the general elections were held all over the country. In East Pakistan, the Awami League, led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, held almost all seats but no seat in any of four provinces of West Pakistan. The socialist Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) had won the exclusive mandate in four provinces of West Pakistan but none in East Pakistan. The Pakistan Muslim League (PML), led by Nurul Amin, was the only party to have representation from all over the country, but it failed to gain the mandate to run the government. The Awami League had 160 seats in the National Assembly, all won from East Pakistan; the socialist PPP had 81, and the conservative PML had 10. The general elections's results reflected the ugly political reality: the Pakistani electorate was deeply polarized along regional lines, particularly between East Pakistan and West Pakistan.\nAs a result, Pakistan stood politically divided. A series of bilateral talks between the PPP and Mujibur Rahman produced no results and were unable to come to an agreement regarding any transfer of power from West Pakistan's representatives to East Pakistan's, on the basis of the six-point programme. West Pakistan politicians generally felt that the proposed six-point programme was a step towards East Pakistan's full secession.\nBangladesh War.\nWhile the political deadlock continued between the Awami League, the PPP, and the military government after the general elections in 1970, Yahya Khan began coordinating with his military strategists concerning ongoing dissent in East Pakistan. Both Yahya Khan and Bhutto flew to Dhaka and tried negotiations one more time in mid-March 1971, but they ultimately yielded no results.\nOn 25 March 1971, Yahya initiated Operation Searchlight, a crackdown by the Pakistan Armed Forces to suppress Bangali rebellion and the Bengali nationalist movement. It was seen as the sequel to Operation Blitz, which had been launched in November 1970. The Pakistani government's view was that it had to launch a campaign to neutralise a rebellion in East Pakistan to save the unity of Pakistan.\nAs a result of Operation Searchlight, agitation turned into full-scale civil war as Bengali members of the Pakistan Armed Forces and the police mutinied, forming the Mukti Bahini along with members of the general public, with the goal of launching unconventional and hit-and-run operations. A government-in-exile formed across the border in India and proclaimed the independent state of Bangladesh, appointing Sheikh Mujibur Rahman as its head despite him being in a West Pakistan prison at the time.\nViolent disorder and chaos accompanied the Pakistan Army's systematic and deliberate campaign of killing and raping the populace of East Pakistan. The original plan for Operation Searchlight envisioned taking control of the major cities on 26 March 1971 and then eliminating all opposition, political or military within one month. The prolonged Bengali resistance had not been anticipated by Pakistani planners, however. The main phase of Operation Searchlight ended with the fall of the last major town in Bengali hands in mid-May.\nThe total number of people killed in East Pakistan is not known with any degree of accuracy. Bangladeshi authorities claim that 3 million people were killed, while the Hamoodur Rahman Commission, an official Pakistani Government investigation, put the figure as low as 26,000 civilian casualties. In her widely discredited book \"\", Sarmila Bose said between 50,000 and 100,000 combatants and civilians were killed by both sides during the war. A 2008 \"British Medical Journal\" study by Ziad Obermeyer, Christopher J. L. Murray, and Emmanuela Gakidou estimated that up to 269,000 civilians died as a result of the conflict; the authors note that this is far higher than a previous estimate of 58,000 put forward by Uppsala University and the Peace Research Institute in Oslo.\nGeneral Yahya Khan arrested Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on charges of sedition and appointed Brigadier (later General) Rahimuddin Khan to preside over a special tribunal dealing with Mujib's case. Rahimuddin gave Mujib the death sentence, but President Yahya put the verdict into abeyance. Yahya's crackdown, however, had led to the Bangladesh Liberation War within Pakistan. India would eventually be drawn into said war, fighting on behalf of the Bangladeshis against Pakistan; the war would later extend into the Indo-Pakistani war of 1971.\nThe consequences of the war were mainly that East Pakistan became independent as Bangladesh, and that India captured approximately of land previously in West Pakistan. However, the captured territory was given back to Pakistan in the Simla Agreement signed on 2 July 1972 between Indira Gandhi and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.\nThe 1971 war led to increased tensions between Pakistan and India, although Pakistan recognised the independence of Bangladesh following severe pressure from the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.\nUS role.\nThe United States had been a major sponsor of President Yahya's military government. American journalist Gary Bass notes in \"\", \"Nixon liked very few people, but he did like General Agha Muhammad Yahya Khan.\" Personal initiatives of President Yahya had helped to establish the communication channel between the United States and China, which would be used to set up the Nixon's trip in 1972.\nSince 1960, Pakistan was perceived in the United States as an integral bulwark against global Communism in the Cold War. The United States cautiously supported Pakistan during the 1971 conflict, although Congress kept an arms embargo in place. The economically-socialist India entered into a formal alliance with the Soviet Union in August 1971.\nNixon urged President Yahya Khan multiple times to exercise restraint. His objective was to prevent a war and safeguard Pakistan's interests, though he feared an Indian invasion of Pakistan that would lead to Indian domination of the subcontinent and strengthen the position of the Soviet Union. Similarly, President Yahya feared that an independent Bangladesh could lead to the disintegration of Pakistan, and said publicly in August 1971 that Indian military support for Bengali guerrillas could lead to war between India and Pakistan.\nIn November 1971, Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi met Nixon in Washington. She assured him that she didn't want war with Pakistan, but he did not believe her. Witness accounts presented by Kissinger pointed out that Nixon made specific proposals to Prime Minister Gandhi on a solution for the crisis, some of which she heard for the first time, including a mutual withdrawal of troops from the Indo-East Pakistan borders. Nixon also expressed a wish to fix a time limit with Yahya for political accommodation in East Pakistan. Nixon asserted that India could count on US endeavors to ease the crisis within a short time. But, both Kissinger and Gandhi's aide Jayakar maintained, Gandhi did not respond to these proposals. Kissinger noted that she \"listened to what was, in fact, one of Nixon's better presentations with aloof indifference\" but \"took up none of the points.\" Jayakar pointed out that Gandhi listened to Nixon \"without a single comment, creating an impregnable space so that no real contact was possible.\" She also refrained from assuring Nixon that India would follow Pakistan's suit if it withdrew from India's borders. As a result, the main agenda was \"dropped altogether.\"\nOn 21 November Indian army start incursions on East Pakistan in the response of this on 3 December 1971, Yahya preemptively attacked the Indian Air Force and Gandhi retaliated, pushing into East Pakistan. Nixon issued a statement blaming Pakistan for starting the conflict and blaming India for escalating it. He favored a cease-fire. The United States was secretly encouraging the shipment of military equipment from Iran, Turkey, and Jordan to Pakistan, offering to replenish those countries' weapons stocks later despite Congressional objections. The US used the threat of an aid cut-off to force Pakistan to back down, while its continued military aid to Islamabad prevented India from launching incursions deeper into the country. Pakistan forces in East Pakistan surrendered in Dhaka on 16 December 1971, leading to the creation of the independent state of Bangladesh.\nFall from power.\nWhen the news of Pakistan's surrender was broadcast by West Pakistani media, the spontaneous and overwhelming public anger over the nation's defeat by Bangladeshi rebels and the Indian Army, and over the breakup of Pakistan into two parts, boiled into street demonstrations throughout Pakistan. Rumors of an impending coup d'\u00e9tat by junior military officers against President Yahya Khan swept the country. To forestall further unrest, on 20 December 1971, he handed over the presidency and government to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the ambitious leader of the (at that time) powerful and popular People's Party. Yahya became the highest-ranking official in what remained of Pakistan to be forced out due to the war.\nWithin hours of Yahya Khan stepping down, President Bhutto reversed the Judge Advocate General Branch's verdict against Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and instead released him, allowing him to fly to London. President Bhutto also issued orders for the house arrest of Yahya, the man who imprisoned Mujib in the first place. Both actions made news headlines around the world.\nPersonal life.\nReligion.\nHe was nominally a Shia Muslim, but was non-practising and was known to have indulged in activities prohibited in Islam such as womanizing and the consumption of alcoholic beverages. Indian journalist Dewan Berindranath argued that Yahya turned to alcohol and womanizing when he gained power, as a coping mechanism to deal with stress, and that when he was a soldier he was known for being morally upright, abstaining from partying unlike other officers and instead preferring to spend time with his family and also practicing Islamic rituals such as the fast of Ramadan, eventually quoting Ayub Khan who said that \"Give me half a dozen officers of the calibre and moral standards of Yahya Khan and I can show you what can Pakistan do as a great nation of the Islamic world.\"\nDuring his rule from 1969 to 1971, Mian Tufail Mohammad, a prominent leader of the Jamaat-e-Islami, the country's main Islamist party, hailed Yahya as \"the champion of Islam\", as there was a general view among Islamists that he would fight leftist elements of the country (the Pakistan People's Party in West Pakistan and the All-Pakistan Awami League in what was East Pakistan and now Bangladesh) and also push for the Islamization of the Constitution. More generally, Yahya used the intelligence services (the ISI and the IB) \"to keep secular political parties under check\", mobilizing the Information Ministry for propaganda and pushing the idea that they put \"Islam and Pakistan in danger.\"\nTowards the end of his life, during and following his imprisonment, Yahya slowly abandoned drinking altogether as he \"turned extremely religious.\"\nRelationships.\nYahya is said to have had a relationship with Akleem Akhtar, nicknamed General Rani, but they never married. His name was linked with the singer and actress Noor Jehan as well. He also had a brief relationship with a Bengali woman called Shamim K. Hussain, also known as \"Black Beauty\". The wife of a police officer, Yahya appreciated her company not so much for her looks but mainly because she was fluent in English and could talk about Shakespeare and Lord Byron, among his favourite poets, and she eventually became influential enough to shape the decisions of the foreign office.\nFamily.\nYahya's older brother Agha Muhammad Ali Khan had been the Chief of the Intelligence Bureau. Having joined government service in 1935 as Police Inspector, he woud later serve as Superintendent (SP) in cities such as Lahore.\nYahya and his wife Fakhra had a son, Ali Yahya Khan, and a daughter, Yasmeen Khan.\nHis nephew Ahmed Ali was a Major who also served as Yahya's aide-de-camp from 1966 to 1969.\nHobbies.\nA \"Time\" editorial writer wrote of Yahya in 1971, \"His only known interest, outside of the military, is birds\u2014all varieties.\" Yahya kept Australian parrots, cranes and swans at the President\u2019s House.\nHowever, Yahya also had a keen interest in poetry, particularly the works of Shakespeare and Lord Byron. He often engaged in discussions about these poets, especially appreciating conversations with individuals fluent in English who could converse on such literary topics.\nLater years and death.\nHouse arrest.\nYahya Khan was placed under house arrest by the succeeding administration of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Initially, Yahya was confined to the Banni rest-house, a forest bungalow near Kharian, without a formal detention order. This location was selected to ensure his isolation and protection as well as to facilitate his forthcoming testimony before the Hamoodur Rahman Commission, which was established on December 26, 1971, to investigate the circumstances leading to Pakistan's military and political failures in East Pakistan.\nOn January 11, 1972, Chief Justice Hamoodur Rahman sent a letter to Yahya, informing him that the commission would commence its proceedings on January 17 and requesting his statement by January 24.\nDuring his detention in Banni, Yahya was under strict surveillance. The rest-house was secured by military personnel, and his communications with the outside world were heavily restricted to prevent any interference with the confidential commission's investigation.\nAfter approximately four months in Banni, on April 20, 1972, Yahya was transferred to his personal residence at 61 Harley Street in central Rawalpindi. His house arrest continued under lessened restrictions. The house was only thinly guarded by a few police officers.\nDeclining health.\nYahya\u2019s health had significantly deteriorated during his years in house arrest. He was suffering from a combination of serious medical conditions, including diabetes, a heart condition, and reports also suggest that his mental health was affected as well.\nAdditionally, a stroke which left him half paralysed and his obesity had worsened his health, making him increasingly frail and incapable of resuming a normal life. Some sources suggest that by the time he was released, he was unable to care for himself fully.\nYahya remained under house arrest until 1977, when he was released from custody by martial law administrator General Fazle Haq due to his failing health. However Yahya remained a recluse. He stayed out from public events and wrote down his memoirs in the form of notes that remain unpublished. He died from a stroke on 10 August 1980 in Rawalpindi, Punjab.\nState funeral.\nYahya Khan's funeral was marked by full military honors. After his death, the military government under General Zia-ul-Haq, which had taken power in a 1977 Pakistani military coup, accorded him a dignified military funeral. This ceremony reflected the respect given to a former military leader, acknowledging his service as the President and Chief Martial Law Administrator.\nThe funeral was held in Peshawar, where Yahya was laid to rest at Circle Road Graveyard. The ceremony was attended by senior military officials and dignitaries from the regime. It is likely that the funeral was also a gesture to emphasize continuity within Pakistan\u2019s military leadership, despite the tensions surrounding Yahya's legacy.\nLegacy.\nIn Pakistan.\nYahya Khan was awarded , but then stripped of his service honours by the Zulfikar Ali Bhutto regime. Khan is viewed largely negatively by Pakistani historians and is considered among the worst but also one of the most misunderstood of the country's leaders. His rule is widely regarded as one of the leading causes of the fall of Dhaka and the breakup of Pakistan, but not entirely of his own making.\nIn the United States.\nIn the United States, he has been appreciated for facilitating the American opening to China, President Richard Nixon sending a handwritten letter to him, stating that \"without your personal assistance the profound breakthrough in relations between the USA and the [Peoples Republic of China] would never have been accomplished... Those who want a more peaceful world in the generations to come will be forever in your debt.\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "34361", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34361", "title": "York", "text": "City in North Yorkshire, England\nYork is a cathedral city in North Yorkshire, England, with Roman origins, sited at the confluence of the rivers Ouse and Foss. It has many historic buildings and other structures, such as a minster, castle and city walls, all of which are Grade I listed. It is the largest settlement and the administrative centre of the wider City of York district. It is located north-east of Leeds, south of Newcastle upon Tyne and north of London. York's built-up area had a recorded population of 141,685 at the 2021 census.\nThe city was founded under the name of Eboracum in AD\u00a071. It then became the capital of Britannia Inferior, a province of the Roman Empire, and was later the capital of the kingdoms of Deira, Northumbria and Scandinavian York. In the Middle Ages it became the northern England ecclesiastical province's centre, and grew as a wool-trading centre. In the 19th century it became a major railway network hub and confectionery-manufacturing centre. In the Second World War York was bombed in the Baedeker Blitz. Although York was less targeted during the war than other, more industrialised northern cities, several historic buildings were gutted and restoration took place up until the 1960s.\nHistoric local governance of the city was as a county corporate, not included in the county's riding system. The city has since been locally governed as a municipal borough, county borough, and since 1996, a non-metropolitan district (the City of York), which also includes surrounding villages and rural areas, and the town of Haxby. The current district's local council, City of York Council, is responsible for providing all local services and facilities throughout this area.\nToponymy.\nYork was known to the Romans as or , a Latinisation of the Brittonic . The latter may mean \"place of yew trees\", from and , a suffix meaning \"associated with\". is also recorded as a personal name, however, so an alternative etymology would be \"property of Eburos\". Indeed, the 12th\u2011century chronicler Geoffrey of Monmouth attributed the name to a legendary king named Ebraucus.\nBy the time of the Anglo-Saxon settlement, the Brittonic name had developed into something like (compare modern Welsh ). The Anglo-Saxons associated the first element with the word , meaning \"boar\", and referred to the city as (literally \"boar town\"). This was in turn adapted into Old Norse as , which later became or simply . The Norse name was then reborrowed into English as \"York\", a form that first appears in the 13th century. The Old English name survived as or , becoming obsolete after the 15th century.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nArchaeological evidence suggests that Mesolithic people settled in the region of York between 8000 and 7000\u00a0BC, although it is not known whether their settlements were permanent or temporary. By the time of the Roman conquest of Britain, the area was occupied by a tribe known to the Romans as the Brigantes. The Brigantian tribal area initially became a Roman client state, but later its leaders became more hostile and the Roman Ninth Legion was sent north of the Humber into Brigantian territory.\nThe city was founded in AD\u00a071, when the Ninth Legion conquered the Brigantes and constructed a wooden military fortress on flat ground above the River Ouse close to its confluence with the River Foss. The fortress, whose walls were rebuilt in stone by the VI legion based there subsequent to the IX legion, covered an area of and was inhabited by 6,000 legionary soldiers. The site of the \"principia\" (headquarters) of the fortress lies under the foundations of York Minster, and excavations in the undercroft have revealed part of the Roman structure and columns.\nThe Roman emperors Hadrian, Septimius Severus and Constantius I all held court in York during their various campaigns. During his stay between AD 207 and 211 the emperor Severus proclaimed York capital of the province of Britannia Inferior, and it is likely that it was he who granted York the privileges of a \"colonia\" or city. Constantius I died in AD\u00a0306 during his stay in York, and his son Constantine the Great was proclaimed emperor by the troops based in the fortress. In AD\u00a0314 a bishop from York attended the Council at Arles to represent Christians from the province.\nWhile the Roman \"colonia\" and fortress were on high ground, by AD\u00a0400 the town was victim to occasional flooding from the rivers Ouse and Foss, and the population reduced. York declined in the post-Roman era, and was taken and settled by the Angles in the 5th century.\nReclamation of parts of the town was initiated in the 7th century under King Edwin of Northumbria, and York became his chief city. The first wooden minster church was built in York for the baptism of Edwin in 627, according to the Venerable Bede. Edwin ordered the small wooden church be rebuilt in stone; however, he was killed in 633, and the task of completing the stone minster fell to his successor Oswald. In the following century, Alcuin of York came to the cathedral school of York. He had a long career as a teacher and scholar, first at the school at York now known as St Peter's School, founded in AD\u00a0627, and later as Charlemagne's leading advisor on ecclesiastical and educational affairs.\nIn 866 Northumbria was in the midst of internecine struggles when the Vikings raided and captured York. As a thriving Anglo-Saxon metropolis and prosperous economic hub, York was a clear target for the Vikings. Led by Ivar the Boneless and Halfdan, Scandinavian forces (referred to by the Anglo-Saxons as the \"Great Heathen Army\") attacked the town on All Saints' Day. Launching the assault on a holy day proved an effective tactical move \u2013 most of York's leaders were in the cathedral, leaving the town vulnerable to attack and unprepared for battle.\nAfter it was conquered, the city was renamed from the Old English Eoforwic to Jorvik. It became the capital of Viking territory in Britain, and at its peak had more than 10,000 inhabitants. This was a population second only to London within Great Britain. Jorvik proved an important economic and trade centre for the Vikings. Norse coinage was created at the Jorvik mint, while archaeologists have found evidence of a variety of craft workshops around the town's central Coppergate area. These demonstrate that textile production, metalwork, carving, glasswork and jewellery-making were all practised in Jorvik. Materials from as far afield as the Persian Gulf have also been discovered, suggesting that the town was part of an international trading network. Under Viking rule the city became a major river port, part of the extensive Viking trading routes throughout northern Europe.\nThe last ruler of an independent J\u00f3rv\u00edk, Eric Bloodaxe, was driven from the city in AD\u00a0954 by King Eadred in his successful attempt to complete the unification of England.\nAfter the conquest.\nIn 1068, two years after the Norman conquest of England, the people of York rebelled. Initially they succeeded, but upon the arrival of William the Conqueror the rebellion was suppressed. William at once built a wooden fortress on a motte. In 1069, after another rebellion, the king built another timbered castle across the River Ouse. These were destroyed in 1069 and rebuilt by William about the time of his ravaging Northumbria in what is called the \"Harrying of the North\" where he destroyed everything from York to Durham. The remains of the rebuilt castles, now in stone, are visible on either side of the River Ouse.\nThe first stone minster church was badly damaged by fire in the uprising, and the Normans built a minster on a new site. Around the year 1080, Archbishop Thomas started building the cathedral that in time became the current Minster.\nYork prospered in the 12th century. In 1190 York Castle was the site of an infamous massacre of its Jewish inhabitants, in which at least 150 people were murdered, although some authorities put the figure as high as 500.\nThe city, through its location on the River Ouse and its proximity to the Great North Road, became a major trading centre. King John granted the city's first charter in 1212, confirming trading rights in England and Europe. During the later Middle Ages, York merchants imported wine from France, cloth, wax, canvas, and oats from the Low Countries, timber and furs from the Baltic and exported grain to Gascony and grain and wool to the Low Countries.\nYork became a major cloth-manufacturing and trading centre. Edward I further stimulated the city's economy by using the city as a base for his war in Scotland. The city was the location of significant unrest during the so-called Peasants' Revolt in 1381. The city acquired an increasing degree of autonomy from central government including the privileges granted by a charter of Richard II in 1396.\n16th to 18th centuries.\nThe city underwent a period of economic decline during the Tudor period. Under King Henry VIII the Dissolution of the Monasteries saw the end of York's many monastic houses, including several orders of friars, the hospitals of St Nicholas and of St Leonard, the largest such institution in the north of England. This led to the Pilgrimage of Grace, an uprising of northern Catholics in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire opposed to religious reform. Henry VIII restored his authority by establishing the Council of the North in York in the dissolved St Mary's Abbey. The city became a trading and service centre during this period. King Henry VIII spent a lot of time travelling around the country on official Royal Tours also known as \"progresses\". In 1541 Henry VIII and Catherine Howard visited the city of York on their royal tour. The royal party would have been met outside the walls by civic dignitaries before formally entering the city. The civic dignitary would have been the Lord Mayor of York, who at the time of their arrival on 15 September 1541 was Robert Hall. He owned the residential property at 74 Low Petergate. Following a special service held in their honour at York minster, Henry and Catherine rode from the minster down to Petergate, one of the five gateways, and over to the closed Benedictine abbey of St. Mary which had been converted into a palace for the King to stay in while he visited York on his Royal Tour.\nAnne of Denmark came to York with her children Prince Henry and Princess Elizabeth on 11 June 1603. The Mayor gave her a tour and offered her spiced wine, but she preferred beer. Guy Fawkes, who was born and educated in York, was a member of a group of Roman Catholic restorationists that planned the Gunpowder Plot. Its aim was to displace Protestant rule by blowing up the Houses of Parliament while King James I, the entire Protestant, and even most of the Catholic aristocracy and nobility were inside.\nIn 1644, during the English Civil War, the Parliamentarians besieged York, and many medieval houses outside the city walls were lost. The barbican at Walmgate Bar was undermined and explosives laid, but the plot was discovered. On the arrival of Prince Rupert, with an army of 15,000 men, the siege was lifted. The Parliamentarians retreated some from York with Rupert in pursuit, before turning on his army and soundly defeating it at the Battle of Marston Moor. Of Rupert's 15,000 troops, 4,000 were killed and 1,500 captured. The siege was renewed and the city surrendered to Sir Thomas Fairfax on 15 July.\nFollowing the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, and the removal of the garrison from York in 1688, the city was dominated by the gentry and merchants, although the clergy were still important. Competition from Leeds and Hull, together with silting of the River Ouse, resulted in York losing its pre-eminent position as a trading centre, but its role as the social and cultural centre for wealthy northerners was rising. York's many elegant townhouses, such as the Lord Mayor's Mansion House and Fairfax House date from this period, as do the Assembly Rooms, the Theatre Royal, and the racecourse.\nModern history.\nThe railway promoter George Hudson was responsible for bringing the railway to York in 1839. Although Hudson's career as a railway entrepreneur ended in disgrace and bankruptcy, his promotion of York over Leeds, and of his own railway company (the York and North Midland Railway), helped establish York as a major railway centre by the late-19th century.\nThe introduction of the railways established engineering in the city. At the turn of the 20th century, the railway accommodated the headquarters and works of the North Eastern Railway, which employed more than 5,500 people. The railway was instrumental in the expansion of Rowntree's Cocoa Works. It was founded in 1862 by Henry Isaac Rowntree, who was joined in 1869 by his brother the philanthropist Joseph Rowntree. Another chocolate manufacturer, Terry's of York, was a major employer. By 1900, the railways and confectionery had become the city's two major industries.\nYork was a centre of early photography, as described by Hugh Murray in his 1986 book \"Photographs and Photographers of York: The Early Years, 1844\u201379\". Photographers who had studios in York included William Hayes, William Pumphrey, and Augustus Mahalski who operated on Davygate and Low Petergate in the 19th century, having come to England as a refugee after serving as a Polish lancer in the Austro-Hungarian war.\nIn 1942 the city was bombed during the Second World War (part of the Baedeker Blitz) by the \"Luftwaffe\" of Nazi Germany. 92 people were killed and hundreds were injured. Buildings damaged in the raid included the Railway Station, Rowntree's Factory, Poppleton Road Primary School, St Martin-le-Grand Church, the Bar Convent and the Guildhall which was left in total disrepair until 1960.\nWith the emergence of tourism, the historic core of York became one of the city's major assets, and in 1968 it was designated a conservation area. The existing tourist attractions were supplemented by the establishment of the National Railway Museum in York in 1975, the Jorvik Viking Centre in 1984 and the York Dungeon in 1986. The opening of the University of York in 1963 added to the prosperity of the city. In March 2012 York's Chocolate Story opened.\nYork was voted European Tourism City of the Year by European Cities Marketing in June 2007, beating 130 other European cities to gain first place, surpassing Gothenburg in Sweden (second) and Valencia in Spain (third). York was also voted safest place to visit in the 2010 \"Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveller\" Readers' Choice Awards. In 2018 \"The Sunday Times\" deemed York to be its overall 'Best Place to Live' in Britain, highlighting the city's \"perfect mix of heritage and hi-tech\" and as a \"mini-metropolis with cool cafes, destination restaurants, innovative companies \u2013 plus the fastest internet in Britain\". The result was confirmed in a YouGov survey, reported in August 2018, with 92 per cent of respondents saying that they liked the city, more than any of 56 other British cities.\nGovernance.\nLocal.\nThe City of York is governed by the City of York Council. It is a unitary authority that operates on a leader and cabinet style of governance, having the powers of a non-metropolitan county and district council combined. It provides a full range of local government services including Council Tax billing, libraries, social services, processing planning applications, waste collection and disposal, and it is a local education authority. The city council consists of 47 councillors representing 21 wards, with one, two or three per ward serving four-year terms. Its headquarters are at the Guildhall and West Offices in the city centre.\nYork is divided into 21 administrative wards: Acomb, Bishopthorpe, Clifton, Copmanthorpe, Dringhouses and Woodthorpe, Fishergate, Fulford and Heslington, Guildhall, Haxby and Wigginton, Heworth, Heworth Without, Holgate, Hull Road, Huntington and New Earswick, Micklegate, Osbaldwick and Derwent, Rawcliffe and Clifton Without, Rural West York, Strensall, Westfield, and Wheldrake.\nThe members of the cabinet, led by the Council Leader, makes decisions on their portfolio areas individually. Following the Local Government Act 2000, the Council Leader commands the confidence of the city council; the leader of the largest political group and head of the City of York Council. The Leader of the council and the cabinet (consisting of all the executive councillors) are collectively accountable for their policies and actions to the city council. The current Council Leader, Liberal Democrats' Cllr Keith Aspden, was appointed on 22 May 2019, following the 2019 City of York Council election.\nYork's first citizen and civic head is the Lord Mayor, who is the chairman of the City of York Council. The appointment is made by the city council each year in May, at the same time appointing the Sheriff, the city's other civic head. The offices of Lord Mayor and Sheriff are purely ceremonial. The Lord Mayor carries out civic and ceremonial duties in addition to chairing full council meetings. The incumbent Lord Mayor since 26 May 2022 is Councillor David Carr, and the Sheriff is Suzie Mercer.\nYork Youth Council consists of several young people who negotiate with the councillors to get better facilities for York's young people, and who also elect York's Member of Youth Parliament.\nThe results of the 2023 City of York Council election saw the Conservative Party with three councillors, the Liberal Democrats with 19 councillors, the Labour Party had 24 councillors and one Independent. The council went from no overall control in the 2019 election, to being run by the Labour Party holding a majority.\nYork is the traditional county town of Yorkshire, and therefore did not form part of any of its three historic ridings, or divisions. Its Mayor has had the status of Lord Mayor since 1370, one of 23 in England. Only five of these have the title \"The Right Honourable\", the others being the Lord Mayors of London, Bristol, Cardiff and Belfast. York is an ancient borough, and was reformed by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 to form a municipal borough. It gained the status of a county borough in 1889, under the Local Government Act 1888, and existed so until 1974, when, under the Local Government Act 1972, it became a non-metropolitan district in the county of North Yorkshire, whilst retaining its Lord Mayor and its Sheriff. As a result of 1990s UK local government reform, York regained unitary status and saw a substantial alteration in its borders, taking in parts of Selby and Harrogate districts, and about half the population of the Ryedale district. The new boundary was imposed after central government rejected the former city council's own proposal.\nParliament.\nFrom 1997 to 2010, the central part of the district was covered by the City of York constituency, while the remainder was split between the constituencies of Ryedale, Selby, and Vale of York. These constituencies were represented by Hugh Bayley, John Greenway, John Grogan, and Anne McIntosh respectively.\nFollowing their review in 2003 of parliamentary representation in North Yorkshire, the Boundary Commission for England recommended the creation of two new seats for the City of York, in time for the general election in 2010. These are York Central, which covers the inner urban area, and is entirely surrounded by the York Outer constituency.\nCeremonial.\nYork is within the ceremonial county of North Yorkshire and, until 1974, was within the jurisdiction of the Lord Lieutenant of the County of York, West Riding and the County of The City of York. The city does retain the right to appoint its own Sheriff. The holder of the Royal dukedom of York has no responsibilities either ceremonially or administratively as regards to the city.\nGeography.\nLocation.\nYork lies in the Vale of York, a flat area of fertile arable land bordered by the Pennines, the North York Moors and the Yorkshire Wolds. The city was built at the confluence of the Rivers Ouse and Foss on a terminal moraine left by the last ice age.\nDuring Roman times, the land surrounding the Ouse and Foss was marshy, making the site easy to defend. The city is prone to flooding from the River Ouse, and has an extensive network of flood defences with walls along the river, and a liftable barrier across the Foss where it joins the Ouse at the \"Blue Bridge\". In October and November 2000, York experienced the worst flooding in 375 years; more than 300 homes were flooded. In December 2015, the flooding was more extensive and caused major disruption. The extreme impact led to a personal visit by Prime Minister David Cameron. Much land in and around the city is on flood plains too flood-prone for development other than agriculture. The \"ings\" are flood meadows along the Ouse, while the \"strays\" are open common grassland in various locations around the city.\nClimate.\nYork has a temperate oceanic climate (Cfb) with four distinct seasons. As with the rest of the Vale of York, the city's climate is drier and warmer than the rest of the Yorkshire and the Humber region. Owing to its lowland location, York is prone to frosts, fog, and cold winds during winter, spring, and very early summer. Snow can fall in winter from December onwards to as late as April but quickly melts. As with much of the British Isles, the weather is changeable. York experiences most sunshine from May to July, an average of six hours per day. With its inland location, summers are often warmer than the Yorkshire coast with temperatures of 27 \u00b0C or more. Extremes recorded at Linton-on-Ouse between 1984 and 2021 include a highest temperature of on 25 July 2019 and 3 August 1990 and a lowest temperature of on 4 December 2010. The most rainfall in one day was .\nGreen belt.\nYork's urbanised areas are surrounded by a green belt that restricts development in the rural areas and parts of surrounding villages, to preserve the setting and historic character of the city. The green belt surrounds nearly all of the city and its outer villages, extending out into North Yorkshire.\nDemography.\nThe York urban area (built-up area) had a population of 153,717 at the time of the 2011 UK census, compared with 137,505 in 2001.\nThe population of the City of York (Local Authority) was 198,051 and its ethnic composition was 94.3 per cent White, 1.2 per cent Mixed, 3.4 per cent Asian and 0.6 per cent Black. York's elderly population (those 65 and over) was per cent, however only 13.2 per cent were listed as retired.\nAlso at the time of the 2001 UK census, the City of York had a total population of 181,094 of whom 93,957 were female and 87,137 were male. Of the 76,920 households in York, 36.0 per cent were married couples living together, 31.3 per cent were one-person households, 8.7 per cent were co-habiting couples and 8.0 per cent were lone parents. The figures for lone parent households were below the national average of 9.5 per cent, and the percentage of married couples was also close to the national average of 36.5 per cent; the proportion of one person households was slightly higher than the national average of 30.1 per cent.\nIn 2001 the population density was . Of those aged 16\u201374 in York, 24.6 per cent had no academic qualifications, a little lower than 28.9 per cent in all of England. Of York's residents, 5.1 per cent were born outside the United Kingdom, significantly lower than the national average of 9.2 per cent. White British form 95 per cent of the population; the largest single minority group was recorded as Asian, at 1.9 per cent of the population.\nThe number of theft-from-a-vehicle offences and theft of a vehicle per 1,000 of the population was 8.8 and 2.7, compared to the English national average of 6.9 and 2.7 respectively. The number of sexual offences was 0.9, in line with the national average. The national average of violence against another person was 16.2 compared to the York average of 17.5. The figures for crime statistics were all recorded during the 2006\u201307 financial year.\nThe city's estimated population in 2019 was 210,620.\nReligion.\nHaving \"No Religion\" was higher than the national average for York in 2011 and 0.9 per cent lower than having a religion in 2021.\nChristianity has the largest religious following in York; 43.9 per cent of residents reported as Christian at the 2021 census. York has multiple churches, most of which are medieval. Leaders of different Christian denominations work together across the city, forming a network of churches known as One Voice York.\nThere are 33 active Anglican churches in York. It is the northern province's administrative centre, home to the Archbishop of York and the province's Mother Church (York Minster). St William's College behind the Minster, and Bedern Hall, off Goodramgate, are former dwelling places of the canons of the York Minster.\nYork, in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Middlesbrough, has eight churches and a number of different Catholic religious orders. Other Christian denominations active in York include the Religious Society of Friends who have three meeting houses, Methodists, and Unitarians. St Columba's United Reformed Church in Priory Street, originally built for the Presbyterians, dates from 1879.\nPercentages in York following non-Christian religion were below England's national average, in the 2011 census. York's only Mosque is located in the Layerthorpe area, and the city also has a UK Islamic Mission centre. Various Buddhist traditions are represented in the city and around York. There is also an active Jewish community.\nEconomy.\nOverview.\nA July 2020 report by Council stated that York is worth \"\u00a35.2 billion to the UK economy ... with 9,000 businesses and 110,000 people employed across the city\". According to \"Make It York\", the city benefits from features that include a well-educated workforce, \"excellent transport links to both national and international markets, pronounced strengths in a range of high value sectors, a pioneering digital infrastructure,\" and support networks for businesses.\nYork's economy is based on the service industry, which in 2000 was responsible for 88.7% of employment in the city.\nStatistics based on 2019 data indicated that tourism was worth over \u00a3765 million to the city, supported 24,000 jobs and attracted 8.4 million visitors each year.\nThe Employment Rate in 2018 was 78.8%. The private sector accounted for 77,000 jobs in 2019 while 34,500 jobs were in the public sector.\nThe service industries include public sector employment, health, education, finance, information technology (IT) and tourism that accounted for 10.7% of employment as of 2016. Tourism has become an important element of the economy, with the city offering a wealth of historic attractions, of which York Minster is the most prominent, and a variety of cultural activities. As a holiday destination York was the 6th most visited English city by UK residents (2014\u201316) and the 13th most visited by overseas visitors (2016).\nA 2014 report, based on 2012 data, stated that the city receives 6.9 million visitors annually; they contribute \u00a3564 million to the economy and support over 19,000 jobs. In the 2017 Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveller survey of readers, York rated 12th among The 15 Best Cities in the UK for visitors. In a 2020 Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveller report, York rated as the sixth best among ten \"urban destinations [in the UK] that scored the highest marks when it comes to ... nightlife, restaurants, and friendliness\".\nUnemployment in York was low at 4.2% in 2008 compared to the United Kingdom national average of 5.3%. The biggest employer in York is the City of York Council, with over 7,500 employees. Employers with more than 2,000 staff include Aviva (formerly Norwich Union Life), Network Rail, Northern Trains, York Hospitals NHS Trust and the University of York. Other major employers include BT Group, CPP Group, Nestl\u00e9, NFU Mutual and a number of railway companies.\nA 2007 report stated that the economic position at that time very different from the 1950s, when its prosperity was based on chocolate manufacturing and the railways. This position continued until the early 1980s when 30% of the workforce were employed by just five employers and 75% of manufacturing jobs were in four companies. Most industry around the railway has gone, including the York Carriage Works, which at its height in the 1880s employed 5,500 people, but closed in the mid-1990s. York is the headquarters of the confectionery manufacturer Nestl\u00e9 York (formerly Nestl\u00e9 Rowntrees) and home to the \"KitKat\" and eponymous \"Yorkie\" bar chocolate brands. Terry's chocolate factory, makers of the \"Chocolate Orange\", was located in the city; but it closed on 30 September 2005, when production was moved by its owners, Kraft Foods, to Poland. The historic factory building is situated next to the Knavesmire racecourse.\nOn 20 September 2006, Nestl\u00e9 announced that it would cut 645 jobs at the Rowntree's chocolate factory in York. This came after a number of other job losses in the city at Aviva, British Sugar, and Terry's chocolate factory. Despite this, the employment situation in York remained fairly buoyant until the effects of the late 2000s recession began to be felt.\nSince the closure of the carriage works, the site has been developed into offices. York's economy has been developing in the areas of science, technology and the creative industries. The city became a founding National Science City with the creation of a science park near the University of York. Between 1998 and 2008, York gained 80 new technology companies and 2,800 new jobs in the sector.\nEffects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have reached England after cases were discovered in York on 31 January 2020. The pandemic caused an economic slowdown because of restrictions imposed on businesses and on travel in the UK; by January 2021, many cities were in their third lockdown and the country's unemployment rate had reached its highest level in over four years. The retail, hospitality, and tourism sectors were especially hard hit in York. In August 2020, the campaign \"Make It York\" and the city council embarked on a six-month tourism marketing plan \"to reenergise the city while building resident and visitor confidence\".\nA report in June 2020 stated that unemployment had risen 114% over the previous year because of restrictions imposed as a result of the pandemic. In addition to high unemployment during lockdown periods, one analysis by the York and North Yorkshire Local Enterprise Partnership predicted in August 2020 that \"as many as 13,835 jobs in York will be lost in the scenario considered most likely, taking the city's unemployment rate to 14.5%\". Some critics claimed that part of the problem was caused by \"over-reliance on the booming tourism industry at the expense of a long-term economic plan\". Other analyses suggested that \"York is well-placed for the high street to recover and evolve from the pandemic if new businesses focus on creating an attraction or experience rather than traditional retail\". The North Yorkshire Local Enterprise Partnership also \"predicted a significant rise in staycation trips to York in 2021\".\nPublic services.\nUnder the requirements of the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, York City Council appointed a watch committee which established a police force and appointed a chief constable. On 1 June 1968 the York City, East Riding of Yorkshire, and North Riding of Yorkshire police forces were amalgamated to form the York and North East Yorkshire Police. Since 1974, Home Office policing in York has been provided by the North Yorkshire Police. The force's central headquarters for policing York and nearby Selby are in Fulford. Statutory emergency fire and rescue service is provided by the North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service, based in Northallerton.\nThe city's first hospital, York County Hospital, opened in 1740 in Monkgate funded by public subscription. It closed in 1976 when it was replaced by York Hospital, which opened the same year and gained Foundation status in April 2007. It has 524 adult inpatient beds and 127 special purpose beds providing general healthcare and some specialist inpatient, daycase, and outpatient services. It is also known as York District Hospital and YDH.\nThe Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust was formed on 1 July 2006 bringing together South Yorkshire Ambulance Service, West Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service and the North and East Yorkshire parts of Tees, East and North Yorkshire Ambulance Service to provide patient transport. Other forms of health care are provided for locally by clinics and surgeries.\nSince 1998, waste management has been co-ordinated via the York and North Yorkshire Waste Partnership. York's distribution network operator for electricity is CE Electric UK; there are no power stations in the city. Yorkshire Water, which has a local water extraction plant on the River Derwent at Elvington, manages York's drinking and waste water.\nThe city has a magistrates' court, and venues for the Crown Court and the County Court. York Crown Court was designed by the architect John Carr, and built next to the then prison (including execution area).\nBetween 1773 and 1777, the Grand Jury House was replaced by John Carr's elegant Court House for the Assizes of the whole county.\n The Female Prison was built opposite and mirrors the court building positioned around a circular lawn which became known as the \"Eye of the Ridings\", or the \"Eye of York\".\n1776 saw the last recorded instance of a wife hanged and burnt for poisoning her husband. Horse theft was a capital offence. The culprits of lesser crimes were brought to court by the city constables and would face a fine. The corporation employed a \"common informer\" whose task was to bring criminals to justice.\nThe former prison is now the Castle Museum but still contains the cells.\nTransport.\nWater.\nYork's location on the River Ouse, and in the centre of the Vale of York, means that it has always had a significant position in the nation's transport system. The city grew up as a river port at the confluence of the Ouse and the Foss. The Ouse was originally a tidal river, accessible to seagoing ships of the time. Today, both of these rivers remain navigable, although the Foss is only navigable for a short distance above the confluence. A lock at Naburn on the Ouse to the south of York means that the river in York is no longer tidal.\nUntil the end of the 20th century, the Ouse was used by barges to carry freight between York and the port of Hull. The last significant such traffic was the supply of newsprint to the local newspaper's Foss-side print works, which continued until 1997. Today, navigation is almost exclusively leisure-oriented.\nRoads.\nLike most cities founded by the Romans, York is well served by long-distance trunk roads. The city lies at the intersection of the A19 road from Doncaster to Tyneside, the A59 road from Liverpool to York, the A64 road from Leeds to Scarborough and the A1079 road from York to Hull. The A64 road provides the principal link to the motorway network, linking York to both the A1(M) and the M1 motorways at a distance of about from the city. The trans-Pennine M62 motorway is less than away providing links to Manchester and Liverpool.\nThe city is surrounded on all sides by an outer ring road, at a distance of some from the centre of the city, which allows through traffic to by-pass the city. The street plan of the historic core of the city dates from medieval times and is not suitable for modern traffic. As a consequence, many of the routes inside the city walls are designated as car-free during business hours or restrict traffic entirely. To alleviate this situation, six bus-based park and ride sites operate in York. The sites are located towards the edge of the urban area, with easy access from the ring road and allow out of town visitors to complete their journey into the city centre by bus.\nBuses.\nPublic transport within the city is largely bus-based. First York operates the majority of the city's local bus services, as well as the York park and ride services. York was the location of the first implementation of FirstGroup's experimental and controversial FTR bus concept, which sought to confer the advantages of a modern tramway system at a lower cost. The service was withdrawn following an election manifesto pledge by the Labour Group at the 2011 local government election. Transdev York also operates a large number of local bus services. Open-top tourist and sightseeing buses are operated by Transdev York, on behalf of City Sightseeing and York Pullman on behalf of Golden Tours.\nRural services, linking local towns and villages with York, are provided by a number of companies with Transdev York &amp; Country, East Yorkshire and Reliance Motor Services operating most of them. Longer-distance bus services are provided by a number of operators, including Arriva Yorkshire services to Selby, East Yorkshire services to Hull, Beverley, Market Weighton and Pocklington, and Transdev York &amp; Country services to Boroughbridge, Knaresborough, Harrogate, Castle Howard and Malton. Yorkshire Coastliner links Leeds and York with Scarborough, Malton, Pickering and Whitby.\nRailway.\nThe city has been a major railway centre since the first line arrived in 1839, at the beginning of the railway age. For many years, the city hosted the headquarters and works of the North Eastern Railway.\nYork railway station is a principal stop on the East Coast Main Line. It is served by five train operating companies:\nAir.\nThe closest international airports are Leeds Bradford, which is away from the city centre, Teesside , Humberside . Further afield are Manchester and Newcastle .\nManchester Airport \u2013 with connections to Europe, North America, Africa and Asia \u2013 has direct rail links by TransPennine Express with its namesake station. By road, it is accessible by the A64 to the M60 via the A1(M) motorway, M1 and M62.\nTeesside Airport has one rail connection via Darlington and Eaglescliffe, with a limited service by bus from its station. By road, it is accessible by the A19 north to the A67. Newcastle Airport has one connection via Newcastle station, with the metro to ; it is accessible by the A1(M) north to the A1 then the A696.\nLeeds Bradford and Humberside have no direct railway stations, with bus route connections instead. Leeds Bradford serves most major European and North African airports. Humberside is accessible by the A1079 to the A15 via the A63; Leeds Bradford by the A59 to the A658 via the A661.\nYork has an airfield at the former RAF Elvington, south-east of the city centre, which is the home of the Yorkshire Air Museum and used for private aviation. In 2003, plans were drafted to expand the site for business aviation or a full commercial service. Former RAF Church Fenton is also near the city and private; it is now called Leeds East.\nEducation.\nInstitutions.\nYork Castle, a complex of buildings ranging from the medieval Clifford's Tower to the 20th-century entrance to the York Castle Museum (formerly a prison) has had a chequered history. As well as the Castle Museum, the city contains numerous other museums and historic buildings such as the Yorkshire Museum and its Museum Gardens, Jorvik Viking Centre, York Art Gallery, Merchant Adventurers' Hall, the reconstructed medieval house Barley Hall (owned by the York Archaeological Trust), the 18th-century Fairfax House, the Mansion House (the historic home of the Lord Mayor) and the so-called Treasurer's House (owned by the National Trust). The National Railway Museum is situated just beyond the station, and is home to a vast range of transport material and the largest collection of railway locomotives in the world. Included in this collection are the world's fastest steam locomotive LNER Class A4 4468 \"Mallard\" and the world-famous LNER Class A3 4472 \"Flying Scotsman\", which has been overhauled in the Museum.\nAlthough noted for its Medieval history, visitors can also gain an understanding of the Cold War through visiting the York Cold War Bunker, former headquarters of No 20 Group of the Royal Observer Corps.\nThe city's first subscription library opened in 1794. The first free public library, the York Library, was built on Clifford Street in 1893, to mark Queen Victoria's jubilee. A new building was erected on Museum Street in 1927, and this is still the library today; it was extended in 1934 and 1938.\nHigher and further.\nThe University of York's main campus is on the southern edge of the city at Heslington. The Department of Archaeology and the graduate Centres for Eighteenth Century Studies and Medieval Studies are located in the historic King's Manor in the city centre.\nIt was York's only institution with university status until 2006, when the more centrally located York St John University, formerly an autonomous college of the University of Leeds, attained full university status. The city formerly hosted a branch of the University of Law before it moved to Leeds. The University of York also has a medical school, Hull York Medical School.\nThe city has two major further education institutions. York College is an amalgamation of York Technical College and York Sixth Form College. Students there study a very wide range of academic and vocational courses, and range from school leavers and sixth formers to people training to make career moves. Askham Bryan College offers further education courses, foundation and honours degrees, specialising in more vocational subjects such as horticulture, agriculture, animal management and even golf course management.\nSecondary and primary.\nThere are 70 local council schools with over 24,000 pupils in the City of York Council area. The City of York Council manages most primary and secondary schools within the city. Primary schools cover education from ages 5\u201311, with some offering early years education from age 3. From 11 to 16 education is provided by 10 secondary schools, four of which offer additional education up to the age of 18. In 2007, Oaklands Sports College and Lowfield Comprehensive School merged to become one school known as York High School.\nThere is one \"outstanding\" Roman Catholic secondary school in the city, All Saints School, which was founded in 1665, the school is split-site meaning that the education of lower years (years 7\u20139) happens on the Lower Site attached to the oldest running convent in the country, Bar Convent. And the upper years including sixth form are taught on the Upper Site which is on Mill Mount, the former site of Mill Mount County Grammar School for Girls. The Sixth form is the largest sixth form in the city. As a school it plays an essential role in York's Catholic community being the only secondary institution dedicated to the denomination. It was the first Catholic school in the country to admit girls for education in the 1660s.\nYork also has several private schools. St Peter's School was founded in 627. The scholar Alcuin, who went on to serve Charlemagne, taught there. It was also the school attended by Guy Fawkes.\nTwo schools have Quaker origins: Bootham School is co-educational and The Mount School is all-girls. Another all-girls school is Queen Margaret's School, which was established under the Woodard Foundation.\nCulture.\nThe city is part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network as a city of \"Media Arts\". An unsuccessful 2010 bid by York city council and a number of heritage organisations to make a UNESCO World Heritage Site indirectly led to the city making a successful bid for its title.\nTheatre.\nThe Theatre Royal, which was established in 1744, produces an annual pantomime which attracts loyal audiences from around the country. The theatre's veteran star, Berwick Kaler, often played the dame, before he retired from acting in the pantomime in 2019, and officially parted ways with the theatre after the so-called \"Panto Wars\". The Theatre Royal continues to produce an annual pantomime without Kaler, who came out of retirement in 2021 to star in a new panto at The Grand Opera House. Both the Grand Opera House and Joseph Rowntree Theatre also offer a variety of productions. The city is home to the Riding Lights Theatre Company, which as well as operating a busy national touring department, also operates a busy youth theatre and educational departments. York is also home to a number of amateur dramatic groups. The Department of Theatre, Film and Television and Student Societies of the University of York put on public drama performances.\nThe York Mystery Plays are performed in public at intervals, using texts based on the original medieval plays of this type that were performed by the guilds \u2013 often with specific connections to the subject matter of each play. (For instance the Shipwrights' Play is the \"Building of Noah's Ark\" and the fish-sellers and mariners the \"Landing of Noah's Ark\"). The York Cycle of Mystery Plays or Pageants is the most complete in England. Originally performed from wagons at various locations around the city from the 14th century until 1570, they were revived in 1951 during the Festival of Britain, when York was one of the cities with a regional festival. They became part of the York City Festival every three years and later four years. They were mostly produced in a temporary open-air theatre within the ruins of St Mary's Abbey, using some professional but mostly amateur actors. Lead actors have included Christopher Timothy and Robson Green (in the role of Christ) and Dame Judi Dench as a school girl, in 1951, 1954 and 1957. (She remains a Patron of the plays). The cycle was presented in the Theatre Royal in 1992 and 1996, within York Minster in 2000 and in 2002, 2006 and 2010 by Guild groups from wagons in the squares, in the Dean's Park, or at the Eye of York. They go around the streets, recreating the original productions. In 2012, the York Mystery Plays were performed between 2 and 27 August at St Mary's Abbey in the York Museum Gardens.\nMusic.\nThe Academy of St Olave's, a chamber orchestra which gives concerts in St Olave's Church, Marygate, is one of the music groups that perform regularly in York. A former church, St Margaret's, Walmgate, is the National Centre for Early Music, which hosts concerts, broadcasts, competitions and events including the York Early Music Festival. Students, staff and visiting artists of York St John University music department regularly perform lunchtime concerts in the university chapel. The staff and students of the University of York also perform in the city.\nFood and drink.\nEach September since 1997, York has held an annual Festival of Food and Drink. The aim of the festival is to spotlight food culture in York and North Yorkshire by promoting local food production. The Festival attracts up to 150,000 visitors over 10 days from all over the country.\nThe Assize of Ale is an annual event in the city where people in medieval costume take part in a pub crawl to raise money for local charities. It has its origins in the 13th century, when an Assize of Bread and Ale was used to regulate the quality of goods. The current version was resurrected in 1990/91 by the then Sheriff of York, Peter Brown, and is led by the Guild of Scriveners.\nThe Knavesmire, home of York Racecourse, plays host to Yorkshire's largest beer festival every September run by York CAMRA \u2013 York Beer &amp; Cider Festival. It is housed in a marquee opposite the grandstand of the racecourse in the enclosure and in 2016 offered over 450 real ales and over 100 ciders.\nA product claimed to be local is York ham, a mild-flavoured ham with delicate pink colouring. It is traditionally served with Madeira Sauce. The ham has been described as a lightly smoked, dry-cured ham that is saltier but milder in flavour than other European dry-cured hams. Folklore has it that the oak construction for York Minster provided the sawdust for smoking the ham. A likely apocryphal story attributes Robert Burrow Atkinson's butchery shop, in Blossom Street, to be the birthplace of the original York ham, or at least to have made it famous.\nAttractions.\nArchitecture.\nYork Minster, a large Gothic cathedral, dominates the city.\nYork's centre is enclosed by the city's medieval walls, which are a popular walk. These defences are the most complete in England. They have the only walls set on high ramparts and they retain all their principal gateways. They incorporate part of the walls of the Roman fortress and some Norman and medieval work, as well as 19th- and 20th-century renovations.\nThe entire circuit is approximately , and encloses an area of . The north-east section includes a part where walls never existed, because the Norman moat of York Castle, formed by damming the River Foss, also created a lake which acted as a city defence. This lake was later called the King's Fishpond, as the rights to fish belonged to the Crown.\nA feature of central York is the Snickelways, narrow pedestrian routes, many of which led towards the former market-places in Pavement and St Sampson's Square. The Shambles is a narrow medieval street, lined with shops, boutiques and tea rooms. Its unusual name comes from an old English term for an open-air slaughterhouse or meat market. Most of these premises were once butchers' shops, and the hooks from which carcasses were hung and the shelves on which meat was laid out can still be seen outside some of them. The street also contains the Shrine of Margaret Clitherow, although it is not located in the house where she lived. Goodramgate has many medieval houses including the early-14th\u2011century Lady Row built to finance a Chantry, at the edge of the churchyard of Holy Trinity church.\nPubs.\nIn June 2015, York CAMRA listed 101 pubs on its map of the city centre, some of which are hundreds of years old. These include the Golden Fleece, Ye Olde Starre Inne, noted for its sign which has spanned the street since 1733, and The Kings Arms, often photographed during floods. On 18 June 2016, York CAMRA undertook a \"Beer Census\" and found 328 unique real ales being served in over 200 pubs in York, reinforcing the city's reputation as a top UK beer destination.\nTea Rooms.\nIn the centre of York, in St Helen's Square, there is the York branch of Bettys Caf\u00e9 Tea Rooms. Bettys' founder, Frederick Belmont, travelled on the maiden voyage of the \"Queen Mary\" in 1936. He was so impressed by the splendour of the ship that he employed the Queen Mary's designers and craftsmen to turn a dilapidated furniture store in York into an elegant caf\u00e9 in St Helen's Square. A few years after Bettys opened in York war broke out, and the basement 'Bettys Bar' became a favourite haunt of the thousands of airmen stationed around York. 'Bettys Mirror', on which many of them engraved their signatures with a diamond pen, remains on display today as a tribute to them.\nMedia.\nThe York area is served by a local newspaper, \"The Press\" (known as the \"Evening Press\" until April 2006), \"The York Advertiser\" newspaper (based at \"The Press\" on Walmgate), and four local radio stations: BBC Radio York, YorkMix Radio, YO1 Radio and Jorvik Radio. A local commercial radio station, Minster FM, broadcast until 2020 when it was replaced by Greatest Hits Radio York and North Yorkshire. Another digital news and radio website is YorkMix run by former print journalists, that incorporates Local News; What's On; Food &amp; Drink; Things To Do and Business sections with articles written by residents and local journalists. In August 2016 YorkMix was nominated in two categories in the O2 Media Awards for Yorkshire and The Humber.\nLocal news and television programmes are provided by BBC Yorkshire and BBC North East and Cumbria on BBC One and ITV Yorkshire and ITV Tyne Tees on ITV. Television signals are received from either the Emley Moor or Bilsdale transmitters.\nOn 27 November 2013, Ofcom awarded the 12-year local TV licence for the York area to a consortium entitled The York Channel, with the channel due to be on air in spring 2015. This service is now on air as That's TV North Yorkshire.\nYork St John University has a Film and Television Production department with links to many major industrial partners. The department hosts an annual festival of student work and a showcase of other regional films.\nThe University of York has its own television station York Student Television (YSTV) and two campus newspapers \"Nouse\" and \"York Vision\". Its radio station URY is the longest running legal independent radio station in the UK, and was voted Student Radio Station of the Year 2020 at the Student Radio Awards.\nSport.\nFootball.\nThe city's association football team is York City who are competing in the National League as of the 2025\u201326 season. York have played as high as the old Second Division but are best known for their 'giant killing' status in cup competitions, having reached the FA Cup semi-final in 1955 and beaten Manchester United 3\u20130 during the 1995\u201396 League Cup. Their matches are played at the York Community Stadium as of 2021, having previously played at Bootham Crescent since 1932. The most notable footballers to come from York in recent years are Lucy Staniforth, Under-20 World Cup winning captain Lewis Cook and former England manager Steve McClaren.\nYork also has a strong rugby league history. York FC, later known as York Wasps, formed in 1868, were one of the oldest rugby league clubs in the country but the effects of a move to the out of town Huntington Stadium, poor results and falling attendances led to their bankruptcy in 2002. The supporters formed a new club, York City Knights, who played at the same stadium until 2015 when they moved to Bootham Crescent. In 2021, they moved to York Community Stadium. In 2022, the club was renamed York RLFC and as of 2023[ [update]] the men's team (York Knights) play in The Championship and the women's team (York Valkyrie) play in the Super League. There are three amateur rugby league teams in York; New Earswick All Blacks (in New Earswick), York Acorn and Heworth. York International 9s was an annual rugby league nines tournament which took place in York between 2002 and 2009. Amateur side York Lokomotive compete in the Rugby League Conference.\nRugby.\nRugby union has been played in York since the 1860s, with multiple teams currently playing within the city. York RUFC was formed in 1928, and amalgamated with the York Cricket Club in 1966. The teams' home ground is at York sports ground at Clifton Park. The men's 1st team play in North 1 East, with the women's team in RFUW Women's NC1 North East championship. York Railway Institute (RI) RUFC home ground is at the York RI sports club on newlane, York. The men's team currently compete in Yorkshire Division 4 South East (Yorkshire 4), and the ladies team play in the RFUW Women's NC1 North East championship. Based at the York site of chocolate and confectionery maker Nestle Rowntree's, Nestle Rowntree RUFC was founded originally in 1894 and re-founded in 1954. They currently play their home games at York St. John University Sports Field and they compete in Yorkshire Division 4 South East (Yorkshire 4).\nField hockey.\nYork has a few field hockey clubs that compete in the North Hockey League, the Yorkshire Hockey Association League and the BUCS leagues. These are City of York Hockey Club, Acomb Hockey Club and University of York Hockey Club.\nRacing.\nYork Racecourse was established in 1731 and from 1990 has been awarded Northern Racecourse of the Year for 17 years running. This major horseracing venue is located on the Knavesmire and sees thousands flocking to the city every year for the 15 race meetings. The Knavesmire Racecourse also hosted Royal Ascot in 2005. In August, racing takes place over the four-day Ebor Festival that includes the Ebor Handicap dating from 1843.\nOn 6 July 2014, York hosted the start of Stage 2 of the 2014 Tour de France. Starting the D\u00e9part Fictif from York Racecourse, the riders travelled through the city centre to the D\u00e9part Actuel on the A59 just beyond the junction with the Outer Ring Road heading towards Knaresborough. In 2015, the inaugural Tour de Yorkshire was held as a legacy event to build on the popularity of the previous year, with the Day 2 stage finishing in York.\nMotorbike speedway once took place at York. The track in the Burnholme Estate was completed in 1930 and a demonstration event staged. In 1931 the track staged team and open events and the York team took part in the National Trophy.\nOther.\nAn open rowing club York City Rowing Club is located underneath Lendal Bridge. The rowing clubs of The University of York, York St John University Rowing Club and Leeds University Boat Club as well as York City RC use the Ouse for training. There are two sailing clubs close to York, both of which sail dinghies on the River Ouse. The York RI (Railway Institute) Sailing Club has a club house and boat park on the outskirts of Bishopthorpe, a village to the south of York. The Yorkshire Ouse Sailing Club has a club house in the village of Naburn, south of York.\nYork hosts the UK Snooker Championship, which is the second biggest ranking tournament in the sport, at the York Barbican.\nGarrison.\nYork Garrison is a garrison of the British army, which administers a number of units based in and around the city of York. The garrison's current units are:\nInternational relations.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nYork is twinned with:\nIn 2016 York became sister cities with the Chinese city of Nanjing, in line with an agreement signed by the Lord Mayor of York, focusing on building links in tourism, education, science, technology and culture.\nOn 22 October 2014, it announced the first 'temporal twinning' with J\u00f3rv\u00edk, the Viking city on the site of York from 866 to 1066. In 2017 York became UK's first human rights city, which formalised the city's aim to use human rights in decision making.\nFreedom of the City.\nThe following people and military units have received the Freedom of the City of York.\n &lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;a There was no census in 1941: figures are from National Register.

{"id": "34364", "revid": "49214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34364", "title": "Yellow journalism", "text": "Sensationalistic news\nIn journalism, yellow journalism is the use of eye-catching headlines and sensationalized exaggerations for increased sales, while the yellow press are American newspapers which do so. This term is chiefly used in American English, whereas in the United Kingdom, the similar term \"tabloid journalism\" is more common. Other languages, e.g. Russian ( \"zhyoltaya pressa\"), sometimes have terms derived from the American term. Yellow journalism emerged in the intense battle for readers by two newspapers in New York City in the 1890s. It was not common in other cities.\nJoseph Pulitzer purchased the \"New York World\" in 1883 and told his editors to use sensationalism, crusades against corruption, and lavish use of illustrations to boost circulation. William Randolph Hearst then purchased the rival \"New York Journal\" in 1895. They engaged in an intense circulation war, at a time when most men bought one copy every day from rival street vendors shouting their paper's headlines. The term \"yellow journalism\" originated from the innovative popular \"Yellow Kid\" comic strip that was published first in the \"World\" and later in the \"Journal.\"\nThis type of reporting was characterized by exaggerated headlines, unverified claims, partisan agendas, and a focus on topics like crime, scandal, sports, and violence. Historians have debated whether yellow journalism played a large role in inflaming public opinion about Spain's atrocities in Cuba at the time, and perhaps pushing the U.S. into the Spanish-American War of 1898. Most historians say it did not do so. The two papers reached a large working class Democratic audience, while the nation's upscale Republican decision makers (such as President William McKinley and leaders in Congress) seldom read the yellow press.\nDefinitions.\nJournalism historian W. Joseph Campbell described yellow press newspapers as having daily multi-column front-page headlines covering a variety of topics, such as sports and scandal, using bold layouts (with large illustrations and perhaps color), heavy reliance on unnamed sources, and unabashed self-promotion. The term was extensively used to describe two major New York City newspapers around 1900 as they battled for circulation.\nJournalism historian Frank Luther Mott used five characteristics to identify yellow journalism:\nAnother common feature was emphasizing sensationalized crime reporting to boost sales and excite public opinion.\nOrigins: Pulitzer vs. Hearst.\nCoinage and early usage.\nAn English magazine in 1898 noted, \"All American journalism is not 'yellow', though all strictly 'up-to-date' yellow journalism is American!\"\nThe term was coined in the mid-1890s to characterize the sensational journalism in the circulation war between Joseph Pulitzer's \"New York World\" and William Randolph Hearst's \"New York Journal\". The battle peaked from 1895 to about 1898, and historical usage often refers specifically to this period. Both papers were sensationalizing the news in order to drive up circulation, although the newspapers did serious reporting as well. Richard F. Outcault, the author of a popular cartoon strip, the Yellow Kid, was tempted away from the \"World\" by Hearst and the cartoon accounted substantially towards a big increase in sales of the \"Journal\".\nThe term was coined by Ervin Wardman, the editor of the \"New York Press\". Wardman was the first to publish the term but there is evidence that expressions such as \"yellow journalism\" and \"school of yellow kid journalism\" were already used by newsmen of that time. Wardman never defined the term exactly. Possibly it was a mutation from earlier slander where Wardman twisted \"new journalism\" into \"nude journalism\". Wardman had also used the expression \"yellow kid journalism\" referring to the then-popular comic strip which was published by both Pulitzer and Hearst during a circulation war.\nHearst in San Francisco, Pulitzer in New York.\nJoseph Pulitzer purchased the \"New York World\" in 1883 after making the \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\" the dominant daily in that city. Pulitzer strove to make the \"New York World\" an entertaining read, and filled his paper with pictures, games and contests that drew in new readers. Crime stories filled many of the pages, with headlines like \"Was He a Suicide?\" and \"Screaming for Mercy\". In addition, Pulitzer charged readers only two cents per issue but gave readers eight and sometimes 12 pages of information (the only other two-cent paper in the city never exceeded four pages).\nWhile there were many sensational stories in the \"New York World\", they were by no means the only pieces, or even the dominant ones. Pulitzer believed that newspapers were public institutions with a duty to improve society, and he put the \"World\" in the service of social reform. Pulitzer explained that: The American people want something terse, forcible, picturesque, striking, something that will arrest their attention, enlist their sympathy, arouse their indignation, stimulate their imagination, convince their reason, [and] awaken their conscience.\nJust two years after Pulitzer took it over, the \"World\" became the highest-circulation newspaper in New York, aided in part by its strong ties to the Democratic Party. Older publishers, envious of Pulitzer's success, began criticizing the \"World\", harping on its crime stories and stunts while ignoring its more serious reporting\u2014trends which influenced the popular perception of yellow journalism. Charles Dana, editor of the \"New York Sun\", attacked \"The World\" and said Pulitzer was \"deficient in judgment and in staying power.\"\nPulitzer's approach made an impression on William Randolph Hearst, a mining heir who acquired the \"San Francisco Examiner\" from his father in 1887. Hearst studied the \"World\" and resolved to make the \"San Francisco Examiner\" as bright as Pulitzer's paper.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Under his leadership, the \"Examiner\" devoted 24 percent of its space to crime, presenting the stories as morality plays, and sprinkled adultery and \"nudity\" (by 19th-century standards) on the front page. A month after Hearst took over the paper, the \"Examiner\" ran this headline about a hotel fire: HUNGRY, FRANTIC FLAMES. They Leap Madly Upon the Splendid Pleasure Palace by the Bay of Monterey, Encircling Del Monte in Their Ravenous Embrace From Pinnacle to Foundation. Leaping Higher, Higher, Higher, With Desperate Desire. Running Madly Riotous Through Cornice, Archway and Facade. Rushing in Upon the Trembling Guests with Savage Fury. Appalled and Panic-Stricken the Breathless Fugitives Gaze Upon the Scene of Terror. The Magnificent Hotel and Its Rich Adornments Now a Smoldering heap of Ashes. The \"Examiner\" Sends a Special Train to Monterey to Gather Full Details of the Terrible Disaster. Arrival of the Unfortunate Victims on the Morning's Train \u2013 A History of Hotel del Monte \u2013 The Plans for Rebuilding the Celebrated Hostelry \u2013 Particulars and Supposed Origin of the Fire.\nHearst could be hyperbolic in his crime coverage; one of his early pieces, regarding a \"band of murderers\", attacked the police for forcing \"Examiner\" reporters to do their work for them. But while indulging in these stunts, the \"Examiner\" also increased its space for international news, and sent reporters out to uncover municipal corruption and inefficiency.\nIn one well remembered story, \"Examiner\" reporter Winifred Black was admitted into a San Francisco hospital and discovered that poor women were treated with \"gross cruelty\". The entire hospital staff was fired the morning the piece appeared.\nCompetition in New York.\nWith the success of the \"Examiner\" established by the early 1890s, Hearst began looking for a New York newspaper to purchase, and acquired the \"New York Journal\" in 1895, a penny paper.\nMetropolitan newspapers started going after department store advertising in the 1890s, and discovered the larger the circulation base, the better. This drove Hearst; following Pulitzer's earlier strategy, he kept the \"Journal\"'s price at one cent (compared to \"The World\"'s two-cent price) while providing as much information as rival newspapers. The approach worked, and as the \"Journal\"'s circulation jumped to 150,000, Pulitzer cut his price to a penny, hoping to drive his young competitor into bankruptcy.\nIn a counterattack, Hearst raided the staff of the \"World\" in 1896. While most sources say that Hearst simply offered more money, Pulitzer\u2014who had grown increasingly abusive to his employees\u2014had become a difficult man to work for, and many \"World\" employees were willing to jump for the sake of getting away from him.\nAlthough the competition between the \"World\" and the \"Journal\" was fierce, the papers were temperamentally alike. Both were Democratic, both were sympathetic to labor and immigrants (a sharp contrast to upscale papers like the \"New-York Tribune\"'s Whitelaw Reid, that blamed poverty on moral defects). Both invested enormous resources in their Sunday editions, which functioned like weekly magazines, going beyond the normal scope of daily journalism.\nTheir Sunday entertainment features included the first color comic strip pages. \"Hogan's Alley,\" a comic strip revolving around a bald child in a yellow nightshirt (nicknamed The Yellow Kid), became exceptionally popular when cartoonist Richard F. Outcault began drawing it in the \"World\" in early 1896. When Hearst hired Outcault away, Pulitzer asked artist George Luks to continue the strip with his characters, giving the city two Yellow Kids. The use of \"yellow journalism\" as a synonym for over-the-top sensationalism thus started with more serious newspapers commenting on the excesses of \"the Yellow Kid papers\".\nSpanish\u2013American War.\nPulitzer and Hearst in the 1920s and 1930s were blamed as a cause of entry into the Spanish\u2013American War due to sensationalist stories or exaggerations of the terrible conditions in Cuba. However, the majority of Americans did not live in New York City, and the decision-makers who did live there relied more on staid newspapers like the \"Times\", \"The Sun\", or the \"Post\". James Creelman wrote an anecdote in his memoir that artist Frederic Remington telegrammed Hearst to tell him all was quiet in Cuba and \"There will be no war.\" Creelman claimed Hearst responded \"Please remain. You furnish the pictures and I'll furnish the war.\" Hearst denied the veracity of the story, and no one has found any evidence of the telegrams existing. Historian Emily Erickson states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHearst became a war hawk after a rebellion broke out in Cuba in 1895. Stories of Cuban virtue and Spanish brutality soon dominated his front page. While the accounts were of dubious accuracy, the newspaper readers of the 19th century did not expect, or necessarily want, his stories to be pure nonfiction. Historian Michael Robertson has said that \"Newspaper reporters and readers of the 1890s were much less concerned with distinguishing among fact-based reporting, opinion and literature.\"\nPulitzer, though lacking Hearst's resources, kept the story on his front page. The yellow press covered the revolution extensively and often inaccurately, but conditions on Cuba were horrific enough. The island was in a terrible economic depression, and Spanish general Valeriano Weyler, sent to crush the rebellion, herded Cuban peasants into concentration camps, leading hundreds of Cubans to their deaths. Having clamored for a fight for two years, Hearst took credit for the conflict when it came: A week after the United States declared war on Spain, he ran \"How do you like the \"Journal's\" war?\" on his front page. In fact, President William McKinley never read the \"Journal\", nor newspapers like the \"Tribune\" and the \"New York Evening Post\". Moreover, journalism historians have noted that yellow journalism was largely confined to New York City, and that newspapers in the rest of the country did not follow their lead. The \"Journal\" and the \"World\" were pitched to Democrats in New York City and were not among the top ten sources of news in regional papers; they seldom made headlines outside New York City. Piero Gleijeses looked at 41 major newspapers and finds:\nEight of the papers in my sample advocated war or measures that would lead to war before the Maine blew up; twelve joined the pro-war ranks in the wake of the explosion; thirteen strongly opposed the war until hostilities began. The borders between the groups are fluid. For example, the \"Wall Street Journal\" and \"Dun's Review\" opposed the war, but their opposition was muted. The \"New York Herald\", the \"New York Commercial Advertiser\" and the \"Chicago Times-Herald\" came out in favour of war in March, but with such extreme reluctance that it is misleading to include them in the pro-war ranks.\nWar came because public opinion was sickened by the bloodshed, and because leaders like McKinley realized that Spain had lost control of Cuba. These factors weighed more on the president's mind than the melodramas in the \"New York Journal.\" Nick Kapur says that McKinley's actions were based more on his values of arbitrationism, pacifism, humanitarianism, and manly self-restraint, than on external pressures.\nWhen the invasion began, Hearst sailed directly to Cuba as a war correspondent, providing sober and accurate accounts of the fighting. Creelman later praised the work of the reporters for exposing the horrors of Spanish misrule, arguing, \"no true history of the war ... can be written without an acknowledgment that whatever of justice and freedom and progress was accomplished by the Spanish\u2013American War was due to the enterprise and tenacity of \"yellow journalists,\" many of whom lie in unremembered graves.\"\nAfter the war.\nHearst was a leading Democrat who promoted William Jennings Bryan for president in 1896 and 1900. He later ran for mayor and governor and even sought the presidential nomination, but lost much of his personal prestige when outrage exploded in 1901 after columnist Ambrose Bierce and editor Arthur Brisbane published separate columns months apart that suggested the assassination of William McKinley. When McKinley was shot on September 6, 1901, critics accused Hearst's Yellow Journalism of driving Leon Czolgosz to the deed. It was later presumed that Hearst did not know of Bierce's column, and he claimed to have pulled Brisbane's after it ran in a first edition, but the incident would haunt him for the rest of his life, and all but destroyed his presidential ambitions.\nWhen later asked about Hearst's reaction to the incident, Bierce reportedly said, \"I have never mentioned the matter to him, and he never mentioned it to me.\"\nPulitzer, haunted by his \"yellow sins,\" returned the \"World\" to its crusading roots as the new century dawned. By the time of his death in 1911, the \"World\" was a widely respected publication, and would remain a leading progressive paper until its demise in 1931. Its name lived on in the Scripps-Howard \"New York World-Telegram\", and then later the \"New York World-Telegram and Sun\" in 1950, and finally was last used by the \"New York World-Journal-Tribune\" from September 1966 to May 1967. At that point, only one broadsheet newspaper was left in New York City.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is related to pathogens \"Yersinia enterocolitica\", and \"Yersinia pseudotuberculosis\", from which it evolved. \"Yersinia pestis\" is responsible for the disease plague, which caused the Plague of Justinian and the Black Death, one of the deadliest pandemics in recorded history. Plague takes three main forms: pneumonic, septicemic, and bubonic. \"Y. pestis\" is a facultative anaerobic parasitic bacterium that can infect humans primarily via its host the Oriental rat flea (\"Xenopsylla cheopis\"), but also through aerosols and airborne droplets for its pneumonic form. As a parasite of its host, the rat flea, which is also a parasite of rats, \"Y.\u00a0pestis\" is a hyperparasite.\n\"Y. pestis\" was discovered in 1894 by Alexandre Yersin, a Swiss/French physician and bacteriologist from the Pasteur Institute, during an epidemic of the plague in Hong Kong. Yersin was a member of the Pasteur school of thought. Kitasato Shibasabur\u014d, a Japanese bacteriologist who practised Koch's methodology, was also engaged at the time in finding the causative agent of the plague. However, Yersin actually linked plague with a bacillus, initially named \"Pasteurella pestis\"; it was renamed \"Yersinia pestis\" in 1944.\nBetween one thousand and two thousand cases of the plague are still reported to the World Health Organization every year. With proper antibiotic treatment, the prognosis for victims is much better than before antibiotics were developed. Cases in Asia increased five- to sixfold during the time of the Vietnam War, possibly due to the disruption of ecosystems and closer proximity between people and animals. The plague is now most commonly found in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, and Peru. The plague also has a detrimental effect on non-human mammals; in the United States, these include the black-tailed prairie dog and the endangered black-footed ferret.\nGeneral features.\n\"Y. pestis\" is a non-motile coccobacillus, a facultative anaerobic bacterium with bipolar staining (giving it a safety pin appearance) that produces an antiphagocytic slime layer. Similar to other \"Yersinia\" species, it tests negative for urease, lactose fermentation, and indole. The species grows best in temperatures of 28\u201330 \u00b0C (82.4-86 \u00b0F), and at a pH of 7.2\u20137.6, but can live in a large temperature and pH range. It dies very rapidly if exposed to UV light, dried out, or exposed to temperatures higher than 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F). There are 11 species in the \"Yersinia\" genus, and three of them cause human diseases. The other two are \"Yersinia pseudotuberculosis\" and \"Yersinia enterocolitica\", infections by either of these are usually acquired from ingesting contaminated food or water.\nGenome and proteome.\nGenome.\nSeveral complete genome sequences are available for various strains and subspecies of \"Y.\u00a0pestis\": strain KIM (of biovar \"Y.\u00a0p.\u00a0medievalis\"), and strain CO92 (of biovar \"Y.\u00a0p.\u00a0orientalis\", obtained from a clinical isolate in the United States). In 2006 the genome sequence of a strain of biovar Antiqua was completed. Some strains are non-pathogenic, such as that of strain 91001, whose sequence was published in 2004.\nPlasmids.\nLike \"Y.\u00a0pseudotuberculosis\" and \"Y.\u00a0enterocolitica\", \"Y.\u00a0pestis\" is host to the plasmid pCD1. It also hosts two other plasmids, pPCP1 (also called pPla or pPst) and pMT1 (also called pFra), that are not carried by the other \"Yersinia\" species. pFra codes for a phospholipase D that is important for the ability of \"Y.\u00a0pestis\" to be transmitted by fleas. pPla codes for a protease, Pla, that activates plasmin in human hosts and is a very important virulence factor for pneumonic plague. Together, these plasmids and a pathogenicity island called HPI encode several proteins that cause the pathogenesis for which \"Y.\u00a0pestis\" is famous. Among other things, these virulence factors are required for bacterial adhesion and injection of proteins into the host cell, invasion of bacteria in the host cell (via a type-III secretion system), and acquisition and binding of iron harvested from red blood cells (by siderophores). \"Y.\u00a0pestis\" is thought to be descended from \"Y. pseudotuberculosis\", DNA studies have found that the two are 83% similar, which is high enough to be considered the same species. In 1981 it was proposed that \"Y.\u00a0pestis\" be reclassified as a subspecies of \"Y.\u00a0pseudotuberculosis\", but the Judicial Commission of the International Committee on Systematic Bacteriology declined to do this because the course of \"Y.\u00a0pestis\" disease is so different than that of \"Y.\u00a0pseudotuberculosis\", which usually causes a mild diarrhea, that reclassification would generate confusion.\nProteome.\nA comprehensive and comparative proteomics analysis of \"Y.\u00a0pestis\" strain KIM was performed in 2006. The analysis focused on growth under four different sets of conditions that were designed to model flea and mammal hosts.\nSmall noncoding RNA.\nNumerous bacterial small noncoding RNAs have been identified to play regulatory functions. Some can regulate the virulence genes. Some 63 novel putative sRNAs were identified through deep sequencing of the \"Y.\u00a0pestis\" sRNA-ome. Among them was \"Yersinia\"-specific (also present in \"Y.\u00a0pseudotuberculosis\" and \"Y.\u00a0enterocolitica\") Ysr141 (\"Yersinia\" small RNA 141). Ysr141 sRNA was shown to regulate the synthesis of the type III secretion system (T3SS) effector protein YopJ. The Yop-Ysc T3SS is a critical component of virulence for \"Yersinia\" species. Many novel sRNAs were identified from \"Y.\u00a0pestis\" grown \"in vitro\" and in the infected lungs of mice suggesting they play role in bacterial physiology or pathogenesis. Among them, sR035 is predicted to pair with the SD region and transcription initiation site of a thermo-sensitive regulator ymoA, and sR084 is predicted to pair with fur, ferric uptake regulator.\nPathogenesis and immunity.\nIn the urban and sylvatic (forest) cycles of \"Y.\u00a0pestis,\" most of the spreading occurs between rodents and fleas. In the sylvatic cycle, the rodent is wild, but in the urban cycle, the rodent is primarily the brown rat (\"Rattus norvegicus\"). In addition, \"Y.\u00a0pestis\" can spread from the urban environment and back. Transmission to humans is usually through the bite of infected fleas. If the disease has progressed to the pneumonic form, humans can spread the bacterium to others through airborne respiratory droplets; others who catch plague this way will mostly contract the pneumonic form themselves.\nMammals as hosts.\nSeveral species of rodents serve as the main reservoir for \"Y.\u00a0pestis\" in the environment. In the steppes, the natural reservoir is believed to be principally the marmot. In the western United States, several species of rodents are thought to maintain \"Y.\u00a0pestis\". Over 200 species of rodents are reservoirs for \"Y. pestis\", with the common reservoirs varying geographically. In North America the common reservoirs are ground and rock squirrels, chipmunks, and prairie dogs; in Asia the common reservoirs are susliks and gerbils; in Africa the common reservoirs are gerbils and \"Mastomys natalensis\"; and in South America the short-tailed field mouse is a reservoir of note. Several species of rodents are known to have a variable resistance, which could lead to an asymptomatic carrier status. Evidence indicates fleas from other mammals have a role in human plague outbreaks.\nThe lack of knowledge of the dynamics of plague in mammal species is also true among susceptible rodents such as the black-tailed prairie dog (\"Cynomys ludovicianus\"), in which plague can cause colony collapse, resulting in a massive effect on prairie food webs. However, the transmission dynamics within prairie dogs do not follow the dynamics of blocked fleas; carcasses, unblocked fleas, or another vector could possibly be important, instead.\nThe CO92 strain was isolated from a patient who died from pneumonia and who contracted the infection from an infected cat.\nIn other regions of the world, the reservoir of the infection is not clearly identified, which complicates prevention and early-warning programs. One such example was seen in a 2003 outbreak in Algeria.\nFleas as vector.\nThe transmission of \"Y.\u00a0pestis\" by fleas is well characterized, with over 125 species of flea capable of transmitting \"Y. pestis\". Initial acquisition of \"Y.\u00a0pestis\" by the vector occurs during feeding on an infected animal. Several proteins then contribute to the maintenance of the bacteria in the flea digestive tract, among them the hemin storage system and \"Yersinia\" murine toxin (Ymt). Although Ymt is highly toxic to rodents and was once thought to be produced to ensure reinfection of new hosts, it is essential for flea colonization and for the survival of \"Y.\u00a0pestis\" in fleas.\nThe hemin storage system plays an important role in the transmission of \"Y.\u00a0pestis\" back to a mammalian host. While in the insect vector, proteins encoded by hemin storage system genetic loci induce biofilm formation in the proventriculus, a valve connecting the midgut to the esophagus. The presence of this biofilm seems likely to be required for stable infection of the flea. Aggregation in the biofilm inhibits feeding, as a mass of clotted blood and bacteria forms (referred to as \"Bacot's block\" after entomologist A.W. Bacot, the first to describe this phenomenon). Transmission of \"Y.\u00a0pestis\" occurs during the futile attempts of the flea to feed. Ingested blood is pumped into the esophagus, where it dislodges bacteria lodged in the proventriculus, which is regurgitated back into the host circulatory system.\nIn humans and other susceptible hosts.\nPathogenesis due to \"Y.\u00a0pestis\" infection of mammalian hosts is due to several factors, including the ability of these bacteria to suppress and avoid normal immune system responses such as phagocytosis and antibody production. Flea bites allow for the bacteria to pass the skin barrier. \"Y.\u00a0pestis\" expresses a plasmin activator that is an important virulence factor for pneumonic plague and that might degrade blood clots to facilitate systemic invasion. Many of the bacteria's virulence factors are antiphagocytic. Two important antiphagocytic antigens, named F1 (fraction 1) and V or LcrV, are both important for virulence. These antigens are produced by the bacterium at normal human body temperature. Furthermore, \"Y.\u00a0pestis\" survives and produces F1 and V antigens while it is residing within white blood cells such as monocytes, but not in neutrophils. Natural or induced immunity is achieved by the production of specific opsonic antibodies against F1 and V antigens; antibodies against F1 and V induce phagocytosis by neutrophils.\nIn addition, the type-III secretion system (T3SS) allows \"Y.\u00a0pestis\" to inject proteins into macrophages and other immune cells. These T3SS-injected proteins, called \"Yersinia\" outer proteins (Yops), include Yop B/D, which form pores in the host cell membrane and have been linked to cytolysis. The YopO, YopH, YopM, YopT, YopJ, and YopE are injected into the cytoplasm of host cells by T3SS into the pore created in part by YopB and YopD. The injected Yops limit phagocytosis and cell signaling pathways important in the innate immune system, as discussed below. In addition, some \"Y.\u00a0pestis\" strains are capable of interfering with immune signaling (e.g., by preventing the release of some cytokines).\n\"Y.\u00a0pestis\" proliferates inside lymph nodes, where it can avoid destruction by cells of the immune system such as macrophages. The ability of \"Y.\u00a0pestis\" to inhibit phagocytosis allows it to grow in lymph nodes and cause lymphadenopathy. YopH is a protein tyrosine phosphatase that contributes to the ability of \"Y.\u00a0pestis\" to evade immune system cells. In macrophages, YopH has been shown to dephosphorylate p130Cas, Fyb (FYN binding protein) SKAP-HOM and Pyk, a tyrosine kinase homologous to FAK. YopH also binds the p85 subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, the Gab1, the Gab2 adapter proteins, and the Vav guanine nucleotide exchange factor.\nYopE functions as a GTPase-activating protein for members of the Rho family of GTPases such as RAC1. YopT is a cysteine protease that inhibits RhoA by removing the isoprenyl group, which is important for localizing the protein to the cell membrane. YopE and YopT have been proposed to function to limit YopB/D-induced cytolysis. This might limit the function of YopB/D to create the pores used for Yop insertion into host cells and prevent YopB/D-induced rupture of host cells and release of cell contents that would attract and stimulate immune system responses.\nYopJ is an acetyltransferase that binds to a conserved \u03b1-helix of MAPK kinases. YopJ acetylates MAPK kinases at serines and threonines that are normally phosphorylated during activation of the MAP kinase cascade. YopJ is activated in eukaryotic cells by interaction with target cell phytic acid (IP6). This disruption of host cell protein kinase activity causes apoptosis of macrophages, and this is proposed to be important for the establishment of infection and for evasion of the host immune response. YopO is a protein kinase also known as \"Yersinia\" protein kinase A (YpkA). YopO is a potent inducer of human macrophage apoptosis.\nIt has also been suggested that a bacteriophage\u00a0\u2013 Yp\u03c6\u00a0\u2013 may have been responsible for increasing the virulence of this organism.\nDepending on which form of the plague infects the individual, the plague develops a different illness; however, the plague overall affects the host cell's ability to communicate with the immune system, hindering the body's ability to bring phagocytic cells to the area of infection.\n\"Y.\u00a0pestis\" is a versatile killer. In addition to rodents and humans, it is known to have killed camels, chickens, and pigs. Domestic dogs and cats are susceptible to plague, as well, but cats are more likely to develop illness when infected. In either case, the symptoms are similar to those experienced by humans and can be deadly to the animal. People can be exposed by coming into contact with an infected animal (dead or alive), or inhaling infectious droplets that a sick dog or cat has coughed into the air.\nImmunity.\nA formalin-inactivated vaccine was available in the United States for adults in 1993 at high risk of contracting the plague until removal from the market by the Food and Drug Administration. It was of limited effectiveness and could cause severe inflammation. Experiments with genetic engineering of a vaccine based on F1 and V antigens are underway and show promise. However, bacteria lacking antigen F1 are still virulent, and the V antigens are sufficiently variable such that vaccines composed of these antigens may not be fully protective. The United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases has found that an experimental F1/V antigen-based vaccine protects crab-eating macaques but fails to protect African green monkey species. A systematic review by the Cochrane Collaboration found no studies of sufficient quality to make any statement on the efficacy of the vaccine.\nIsolation and identification.\nIn 1894, two bacteriologists, Alexandre Yersin of Switzerland and Kitasato Shibasabur\u014d of Japan, independently isolated in Hong Kong the bacterium responsible for the 1894 Hong Kong plague. Though both investigators reported their findings, a series of confusing and contradictory statements by Kitasato eventually led to the acceptance of Yersin as the primary discoverer of the organism. Yersin named it \"Pasteurella pestis\" in honor of the Pasteur Institute, where he worked. In 1967, it was moved to a new genus and renamed \"Yersinia pestis\" in his honor. Yersin also noted that rats were affected by plague not only during plague epidemics, but also often preceding such epidemics in humans and that plague was regarded by many locals as a disease of rats; villagers in China and India asserted that when large numbers of rats were found dead, plague outbreaks soon followed.\nIn 1898, French scientist Paul-Louis Simond (who had also come to China to battle the Third Pandemic) discovered the rat flea vector that drives the disease. He had noted that persons who became ill did not have to be in close contact with each other to acquire the disease. In Yunnan, China, inhabitants would flee from their homes as soon as they saw dead rats, and on the island of Formosa (Taiwan), residents considered the handling of dead rats to be a high-risk activity for developing plague. These observations led him to suspect that the flea might be an intermediary factor in the transmission of plague, since people acquired plague only if they were in contact with rats that had died less than 24 hours before. In a now classic experiment, Simond demonstrated how a healthy rat died of the plague after infected fleas had jumped onto it from a rat that had recently died of the plague. The outbreak spread to Chinatown, San Francisco, from 1900 to 1904 and then to Oakland and the East Bay from 1907 to 1909. It has been present in the rodents of western North America ever since, as fear of the consequences of the outbreak on trade caused authorities to hide the dead of the Chinatown residents long enough for the disease to be passed to widespread species of native rodents in outlying areas.\nThree main strains are recognised: \"Y.\u00a0p.\u00a0antiqua\", which caused a plague pandemic in the sixth century; \"Y.\u00a0p.\u00a0medievalis\", which caused the Black Death and subsequent epidemics during the second pandemic wave; and \"Y.\u00a0p.\u00a0orientalis\", which is responsible for current plague outbreaks.\n21st century.\nOn 15 January 2018, researchers at the University of Oslo and the University of Ferrara suggested that humans and their parasites (most likely fleas and lice at the time) were the biggest carriers of the plague.\nAncient DNA evidence.\nIn 2010, researchers in Germany definitively established, using PCR evidence from samples obtained from Black Death victims, that \"Y.\u00a0pestis\" was the cause of the medieval Black Death.\nIn 2011, the first genome of \"Y.\u00a0pestis\" isolated from Black Death victims was published, and concluded that this medieval strain was ancestral to most modern forms of \"Y.\u00a0pestis\".\nIn 2015, \"Cell\" published results from a study of ancient graves. Plasmids of \"Y.\u00a0pestis\" were detected in archaeological samples of the teeth of seven Bronze Age individuals, in the Afanasievo culture in Siberia, the Corded Ware culture in Estonia, the Sintashta culture in Russia, the Unetice culture in Poland, and the Andronovo culture in Siberia. In 2018, the emergence and spread of the pathogen during the Neolithic decline (as far back as 6,000 years ago) was published. A site in Sweden was the source of the DNA evidence and trade networks were proposed as the likely avenue of spread rather than migrations of populations. There is evidence that suggests \"Y.\u00a0pestis\" may have originated in Europe in the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture, not in Asia as is more commonly believed.\nDNA evidence published in 2015 indicates \"Y.\u00a0pestis\" infected humans 5,000 years ago in Bronze Age Eurasia, but genetic changes that made it highly virulent did not occur until about 4,000 years ago. The highly virulent version capable of transmission by fleas through rodents, humans, and other mammals was found in two individuals associated with the Srubnaya culture from the Samara region in Russia from around 3,800 years ago and an Iron Age individual from Kapan, Armenia, from around 2,900 years ago. This indicates that at least two lineages of \"Y.\u00a0pestis\" were circulating during the Bronze Age in Eurasia. The \"Y.\u00a0pestis\" bacterium has a relatively large number of nonfunctioning genes and three \"ungainly\" plasmids, suggesting an origin less than 20,000 years ago. One such strain has been identified from about 4000\u00a0BP (the \"LNBA lineage\" (Late Neolithic and Bronze Age lineage)) in western Britain, indicating that this highly transmissible form spread from Eurasia to the far north-western edges of Europe.\nIn 2016, the \"Y.\u00a0pestis\" bacterium was identified from DNA in teeth found at a Crossrail building site in London. The human remains were found to be victims of the Great Plague of London, which lasted from 1665 to 1666.\nIn 2021, researchers found a 5,000-year-old victim of \"Y.\u00a0pestis\", the world's oldest-known, in hunter-gatherer remains in the modern Latvian and Estonian border area.\nBetween 5,300 and 4,900 YBP, the population of Neolithic farmers in northern Europe underwent a marked decline. It had not been determined whether this was the result of agricultural recession or from \"Y.\u00a0pestis\" infection within the population. A 2024 study of Neolithic graves in Denmark and western Sweden concluded that plague was sufficiently widespread to be the cause of the decline, and that there were three outbreaks in Northern Europe between 5,200 years ago and 4,900 years ago, with the final outbreak caused by a strain of \"Yersinia pestis\" with reshuffled genes. However, another recent study, contests this notion. Based on 133 individuals from gallery graves of the Wartberg Culture, a research team from Kiel University (Collaborative Research Centre 1266) found \"Yersinia pestis\" in two individuals only. This indicates that there was no large-scale disease outbreak in this cultural context. Moreover, they found that a dog was infected.\nIn August 2025, researchers published findings recovering \"Y.\u00a0pestis\" genome from the teeth of domesticated sheep from the Bronze Age (about 4,000 years ago) in modern-day Russia, showing zoonotic evidence of its transmission from livestock.\nEvents.\nBetween 1970 and 2020, 496 cases were reported in the United States. Cases have been found predominantly in New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, California, Oregon, and Nevada.\nIn 2008, plague was commonly found in sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar, areas that accounted for over 95% of the reported cases.\nIn September 2009, the death of Malcolm Casadaban, a molecular genetics professor at the University of Chicago, was linked to his work on a weakened laboratory strain of \"Y.\u00a0pestis\". Hemochromatosis was hypothesised to be a predisposing factor in Casadaban's death from this attenuated strain used for research.\nOn 3 November 2019, two cases of pneumonic plague were diagnosed at a hospital in Beijing's Chaoyang district, prompting fears of an outbreak. The patient was a middle-aged man with fever who had complained of difficulty breathing for some ten days, accompanied by his wife, with similar symptoms. Police quarantined the emergency room at the hospital, and controls were placed on Chinese news aggregators. On 18 November, a third case was reported, in a 55-year-old man from Xilingol League, one of the twelve Mongolian autonomous regions in Northern China. The patient received treatment, and 28 symptomless contacts were placed in quarantine.\nIn July 2020, officials increased precautions after a case of bubonic plague was confirmed in Bayannur, a city in China's Inner Mongolia autonomous region. The patient was quarantined and treated. According to China's \"Global Times\", a second suspected case was also investigated, and a level 3 alert was issued, in effect until the end of the year. It forbade hunting and eating of animals that could carry plague and called on the public to report suspected cases.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is evoked by light with a dominant wavelength of roughly 575\u2013585 nm. It is a primary color in subtractive color systems, used in painting or color printing. In the RGB color model, used to create colors on television and computer screens, yellow is a secondary color made by combining red and green at equal intensity. Carotenoids give the characteristic yellow color to autumn leaves, corn, canaries, daffodils, and lemons, as well as egg yolks, buttercups, and bananas. They absorb light energy and protect plants from photo damage in some cases. Sunlight has a slight yellowish hue when the Sun is near the horizon, due to atmospheric scattering of shorter wavelengths (green, blue, and violet).\nBecause it was widely available, yellow ochre pigment was one of the first colors used in art; the Lascaux cave in France has a painting of a yellow horse 17,000 years old. Ochre and orpiment pigments were used to represent gold and skin color in Egyptian tombs, then in the murals in Roman villas. In the early Christian church, yellow was the color associated with the Pope and the golden keys of the Kingdom, but it was also associated with Judas Iscariot and used to mark heretics. In the 20th century, Jews in Nazi-occupied Europe were forced to wear a yellow star. In China, bright yellow was the color of the Middle Kingdom, and could be worn only by the emperor and his household; special guests were welcomed on a yellow carpet.\nAccording to surveys in Europe, Canada, the United States and elsewhere, yellow is the color people most often associate with amusement, gentleness, humor, happiness, and spontaneity; however it can also be associated with duplicity, envy, jealousy, greed, justice, and, in the U.S., cowardice. In Iran it has connotations of pallor/sickness, but also wisdom and connection. In China and many Asian countries, it is seen as the color of royalty, nobility, respect, happiness, glory, harmony and wisdom.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"yellow\" is from the Old English (oblique case), meaning \"yellow, and yellowish\", derived from the Proto-Germanic word \"gelwaz\" \"yellow\". It has the same Indo-European base, \"\", as the words \"gold\" and \"yell\"; \"g\u02b0el-\" means both bright and gleaming, and to cry out.\nThe English term is related to other Germanic words for \"yellow\", namely Scots ', East Frisian \"jeel\", West Frisian ', Dutch ', German ', and Swedish and Norwegian \"\". According to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", the oldest known use of this word in English is from \"The Epinal Glossary\" in 700.\nScience and nature.\nOptics, color printing, and computer screens.\nYellow is found between green and red on the spectrum of visible light. It is the color the human eye sees when it looks at light with a dominant wavelength between 570 and 590 nanometers.\nIn color printing, yellow is one of the three subtractive primary colors of ink along with magenta and cyan. Together with black, they can be overlaid in the right combination to print any full color image. (See the CMYK color model). A particular yellow is used, called Process yellow (also known as \"pigment yellow\", \"printer's yellow\", and \"canary yellow\"). Process yellow is not an RGB color, and there is no fixed conversion from CMYK primaries to RGB. Different formulations are used for printer's ink, so there can be variations in the printed color that is pure yellow ink.\nThe yellow on a color television or computer screen is created in a completely different way; by combining green and red light at the right level of intensity. (See RGB color model).\nComplementary colors.\nTraditionally, the complementary color of yellow is purple; the two colors are opposite each other on the RYB color wheel long used by painters. Vincent van Gogh, an avid student of color theory, used combinations of yellow and purple in several of his paintings for the maximum contrast and harmony.\nHunt defines that \"two colors are complementary when it is possible to reproduce the tristimulus values of a specified achromatic stimulus by an additive mixture of these two stimuli.\" That is, when two colored lights can be mixed to match a specified white (achromatic, non-colored) light, the colors of those two lights are complementary. This definition, however, does not constrain what version of white will be specified. In the nineteenth century, the scientists Grassmann and Helmholtz did experiments in which they concluded that finding a good complement for spectral yellow was difficult, but that the result was indigo, that is, a wavelength that today's color scientists would call blue or blue-violet. Helmholtz says \"Yellow and indigo blue\" are complements. Grassmann reconstructs Newton's category boundaries in terms of wavelengths and says \"This indigo therefore falls within the limits of color between which, according to Helmholtz, the complementary colors of yellow lie.\"\nNewton's own color circle has yellow directly opposite the boundary between indigo and violet. These results, that the complement of yellow is a wavelength shorter than 450\u00a0nm, are derivable from the modern CIE 1931 system of colorimetry if it is assumed that the yellow is about 580\u00a0nm or shorter wavelength, and the specified white is the color of a blackbody radiator of temperature 2800 K or lower (that is, the white of an ordinary incandescent light bulb). More typically, with a daylight-colored or around 5000 to 6000 K white, the complement of yellow will be in the blue wavelength range, which is the standard modern answer for the complement of yellow.\nBecause of the characteristics of paint pigments and use of different color wheels, painters traditionally regard the complement of yellow as the color indigo or blue-violet.\nLasers.\nLasers emitting in the yellow part of the spectrum are less common and more expensive than most other colors. In commercial products diode pumped solid state (DPSS) technology is employed to create the yellow light. An infrared laser diode at 808\u00a0nm is used to pump a crystal of neodymium-doped yttrium vanadium oxide (Nd:YVO4) or neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) and induces it to emit at two frequencies (281.76\u00a0THz and 223.39\u00a0THz: 1064\u00a0nm and 1342\u00a0nm wavelengths) simultaneously. This deeper infrared light is then passed through another crystal containing potassium, titanium and phosphorus (KTP), whose non-linear properties generate light at a frequency that is the sum of the two incident beams (505.15\u00a0THz); in this case corresponding to the wavelength of 593.5\u00a0nm (\"yellow\"). This wavelength is also available, though even more rarely, from a helium\u2013neon laser. However, this not a true yellow, as it exceeds 590\u00a0nm. A variant of this same DPSS technology using slightly different starting frequencies was made available in 2010, producing a wavelength of 589\u00a0nm, which is considered a true yellow color. The use of yellow lasers at 589\u00a0nm and 594\u00a0nm have recently become more widespread thanks to the field of optogenetics.\nAstronomy.\nStars of spectral classes F and G have color temperatures that make them look \"yellowish\". The first astronomer to classify stars according to their color was F. G. W. Struve in 1827. One of his classifications was , or yellow, and this roughly corresponded to stars in the modern spectral range F5 to K0. The Str\u00f6mgren photometric system for stellar classification includes a 'y' or yellow filter that is centered at a wavelength of 550\u00a0nm and has a bandwidth of 20\u201330\u00a0nm.\nSupergiant stars are rarely yellow supergiants because F and G class supergiants are physically unstable; they are most often a transitional phase between blue supergiants and red supergiants. Some yellow supergiants, the Cepheid variables, pulsate with a period proportional to their absolute magnitude; hence, if their apparent magnitude is known, the distance to them can be calculated with great precision. Cepheid variables were hence used to determine distances within and beyond the Milky Way galaxy. The most famous example is the current North Pole star, Polaris.\nBiology.\nAutumn leaves, yellow flowers, bananas, oranges and other yellow fruits all contain carotenoids, yellow and red organic pigments that are found in the chloroplasts and chromoplasts of plants and some other photosynthetic organisms like algae, some bacteria and some fungi. They serve two key roles in plants and algae: they absorb light energy for use in photosynthesis, and they protect the green chlorophyll from photodamage.\nIn late summer, as daylight hours shorten and temperatures cool, the veins that carry fluids into and out of the leaf are gradually closed off. The water and mineral intake into the leaf is reduced, slowly at first, and then more rapidly. It is during this time that the chlorophyll begins to decrease. \nAs the chlorophyll diminishes, the yellow and red carotenoids become more and more visible, creating the classic autumn leaf color.\nCarotenoids are common in many living things; they give the characteristic color to carrots, maize, daffodils, rutabagas, buttercups and bananas. They are responsible for the red of cooked lobsters, the pink of flamingoes and salmon and the yellow of canaries and egg yolks.\nXanthophylls are the most common yellow pigments that form one of two major divisions of the carotenoid group. The name is from Greek \"xanthos\" (, \"yellow\") + \"phyllon\" (, \"leaf\"). Xanthophylls are most commonly found in the leaves of green plants, but they also find their way into animals through the food they eat. For example, the yellow color of chicken egg yolks, fat, and skin comes from the feed the chickens consume. Chicken farmers understand this, and often add xanthophylls, usually lutein, to make the egg yolks more yellow.\nBananas are green when they are picked because of the chlorophyll their skin contains. Once picked, they begin to ripen; hormones in the bananas convert amino acids into ethylene gas, which stimulates the production of several enzymes. These enzymes start to change the color, texture and flavor of the banana. The green chlorophyll supply is stopped and the yellow color of the carotenoids replaces it; eventually, as the enzymes continue their work, the cell walls break down and the bananas turn brown.\nHistory, art, and fashion.\nPrehistory.\nYellow, in the form of yellow ochre pigment made from clay, was one of the first colors used in prehistoric cave art. The cave of Lascaux has an image of a horse colored with yellow estimated to be 17,300 years old.\nAncient history.\nIn Ancient Egypt, yellow was associated with gold, which was considered to be imperishable, eternal and indestructible. The skin and bones of the gods were believed to be made of gold. The Egyptians used yellow extensively in tomb paintings; they usually used either yellow ochre or the brilliant orpiment, though it was made of arsenic and was highly toxic. A small paintbox with orpiment pigment was found in the tomb of King Tutankhamun. Men were always shown with brown faces, women with yellow ochre or gold faces.\nThe ancient Romans used yellow in their paintings to represent gold and also in skin tones. It is found frequently in the murals of Pompeii.\nPost-classical history.\nDuring the Post-Classical period, yellow became firmly established as the color of Judas Iscariot, the disciple who betrayed Jesus Christ, even though the Bible never describes his clothing. From this connection, yellow also took on associations with envy, jealousy and duplicity.\nThe tradition started in the Renaissance of marking non-Christian outsiders, such as Jews, with the color yellow. In 16th-century Spain, those accused of heresy and who refused to renounce their views were compelled to come before the Spanish Inquisition dressed in a yellow cape.\nThe color yellow has been historically associated with moneylenders and finance. The National Pawnbrokers Association's logo depicts three golden spheres hanging from a bar, referencing the three bags of gold that the patron saint of pawnbroking, St. Nicholas, holds in his hands. Additionally, the symbol of three golden orbs is found in the coat of arms of the House of Medici, a famous fifteenth-century Italian dynasty of bankers and lenders.\nModern history.\n18th and 19th centuries.\nThe 18th and 19th century saw the discovery and manufacture of synthetic pigments and dyes, which quickly replaced the traditional yellows made from arsenic, cow urine, and other substances.\nc.\u20091776, Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard painted \"A Young Girl Reading\". She is dressed in a bright saffron yellow dress. This painting is \"considered by many critics to be among Fragonard's most appealing and masterly\".\nThe 19th-century British painter J. M. W. Turner was one of the first in that century to use yellow to create moods and emotions, the way romantic composers were using music. His painting \"Rain, Steam, and Speed \u2013 the Great Central Railway\" was dominated by glowing yellow clouds.\nGeorges Seurat used the new synthetic colors in his experimental paintings composed of tiny points of primary colors, particularly in his famous \"Sunday Afternoon on the Isle de la Grand jatte\" (1884\u201386). He did not know that the new synthetic yellow pigment, zinc yellow or zinc chromate, which he used in the light green lawns, was highly unstable and would quickly turn brown.\nThe painter Vincent van Gogh was a particular admirer of the color yellow, the color of sunshine. Writing to his sister from the south of France in 1888, he wrote, \"Now we are having beautiful warm, windless weather that is very beneficial to me. The sun, a light that for lack of a better word I can only call yellow, bright sulfur yellow, pale lemon gold. How beautiful yellow is!\" In Arles, Van Gogh painted sunflowers inside a small house he rented at 2 Place Lamartine, a house painted with a color that Van Gogh described as \"buttery yellow\". Van Gogh was one of the first artists to use commercially manufactured paints, rather than paints he made himself. He used the traditional yellow ochre, but also chrome yellow, first made in 1809; and cadmium yellow, first made in 1820.\nIn 1895 a new popular art form began to appear in New York newspapers; the color comic strip. It took advantage of a new color printing process, which used color separation and three different colors of ink; magenta, cyan, and yellow, plus black, to create all the colors on the page. One of the first characters in the new comic strips was a humorous boy of the New York streets named Mickey Dugen, more commonly known as the Yellow Kid, from the yellow nightshirt he wore. He gave his name (and color) to the whole genre of popular, sensational journalism, which became known as \"yellow journalism\".\n20th and 21st centuries.\nIn the 20th century, yellow was revived as a symbol of exclusion, as it had been in the Middle Ages and Renaissance. Jews in Nazi Germany and German-occupied countries were required to sew yellow triangles with the star of David onto their clothing.\nIn the 20th century, modernist painters reduced painting to its simplest colors and geometric shapes. The Dutch modernist painter Piet Mondrian made a series of paintings which consisted of a pure white canvas with a grid of vertical and horizontal black lines and rectangles of yellow, red, and blue.\nYellow was particularly valued in the 20th century because of its high visibility. Because of its ability to be seen well from greater distances and at high speeds, yellow makes for the ideal color to be viewed from moving automobiles. It often replaced red as the color of fire trucks and other emergency vehicles, and was popular in neon signs, especially in Las Vegas and in China, where yellow was the most esteemed color.\nIn the 1960s, Pickett Brand developed the \"Eye Saver Yellow\" slide rule, which was produced with a specific yellow color (Angstrom 5600) that reflects long-wavelength rays and promotes optimum eye-ease to help prevent eyestrain and improve visual accuracy.\nThe 21st century saw the use of unusual materials and technologies to create new ways of experiencing the color yellow. One example was \"The weather project\", by Danish-Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson, which was installed in the open space of the Turbine Hall of London's Tate Modern in 2003.\nEliasson used humidifiers to create a fine mist in the air via a mixture of sugar and water, as well as a semi-circular disc made up of hundreds of monochromatic lamps which radiated yellow light. The ceiling of the hall was covered with a huge mirror, in which visitors could see themselves as tiny black shadows against a mass of light.\nFruits, vegetables, and eggs.\nMany fruits are yellow when ripe, such as lemons and bananas, their color derived from carotenoid pigments. Egg yolks gain their color from xanthophylls, also a type of carotenoid pigment.\nFlowers.\nYellow is a common color of flowers.\nMinerals and chemistry.\nDyes.\nThe color of saffron comes from crocin, a red variety of carotenoid natural pigment. The color of the dyed fabric varies from deep red to orange to yellow, depending upon the type of saffron and the process. Most saffron today comes from Iran, but it is also grown commercially in Spain, Italy and Kashmir in India, and as a boutique crop in New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France, Switzerland and other countries. In the United States, it has been cultivated by the Pennsylvania Dutch community since the early 18th century. Because of the high price of saffron, other similar dyes and spices are often sold under the name saffron; for instance, what is called \"Indian saffron\" is often really turmeric.\nFood coloring.\nThe most common yellow food coloring in use today is called Tartrazine. It is a synthetic lemon yellow azo dye. It is also known as E number E102, C.I. 19140, FD&amp;C yellow 5, acid yellow 23, food yellow 4, and trisodium 1-(4-sulfonatophenyl)-4-(4-sulfonatophenylazo)-5-pyrazolone-3-carboxylate. It is the yellow most frequently used such processed food products as corn and potato chips, breakfast cereals such as corn flakes, candies, popcorn, mustard, jams and jellies, gelatin, soft drinks (notably Mountain Dew), energy and sports drinks, and pastries. It is also widely used in liquid and bar soap, shampoo, cosmetics and medicines. Sometimes it is mixed with blue dyes to color processed products green.\nIt is typically labelled on food packages as \"color\", \"tartrazine\", or \"E102\". In the United States, because of concerns about possible health problems related to intolerance to tartrazine, its presence must be declared on food and drug product labels.\nAnother popular synthetic yellow coloring is Sunset Yellow FCF (also known as \"orange yellow S\", \"FD&amp;C yellow 6\" and \"C.I. 15985\") It is manufactured from aromatic hydrocarbons from petroleum. When added to foods sold in Europe, it is denoted by E number E110.\nSymbolism and associations.\nIn the west, yellow is not a well-loved color. In a year 2000 survey, only 6% of respondents in Europe and America named it as their favorite color, compared with 45% for blue, 15% for green, 12% for red, and 10% for black. For 7% of respondents, it was their least favorite color. Yellow is considered a color of ambivalence and contradiction. It is associated with optimism and amusement, but also with betrayal, duplicity, and jealousy. However, in China and other parts of Asia, yellow is a color of virtue and nobility.\nIn China.\nYellow has strong historical and cultural associations in China, where \"hu\u00e1ng\" ( or ) is the color of happiness, glory, and wisdom. Although \"hu\u00e1ng\" originally and occasionally still covers a range inclusive of tans and oranges, speakers of modern Standard Mandarin tend to map their use of \"hu\u00e1ng\" to shades corresponding to English yellow.\nIn Chinese symbolism, yellow, red, and green are masculine colors, while black and white are considered feminine. After the development of the theory of five elements, the Chinese reckoned various correspondences. On a five season model, late summer was characterized by yellowing leaves. Yellow was taken as the color of the fifth direction of the compass, the central. China is called the Middle Kingdom; the palace of the Emperor was considered to be in the exact center of the world. The legendary first emperor of China was called the Yellow Emperor and the last, Puyi (1906\u201367), described in his memoirs how every object which surrounded him as a child was yellow. \"It made me understand from my most tender age that I was of a unique essence, and it instilled in me the consciousness of my 'celestial nature' which made me different from every other human.\" The Chinese Emperor was literally considered the child of heaven, with both a political and religious role, both symbolized by yellow. After the Song dynasty, laws banned the use of certain bright yellow shades by anyone but the emperor. Distinguished visitors were honored with a yellow, not a red, carpet.\nIn current Chinese pop culture, the term \"yellow movie\" () refers to films and other cultural items of a pornographic nature, analogous to the English \"blue movie\". This was the basis of the 2007 \"very erotic very violent\" meme, with the word \"erotic\" calquing Chinese \"yellow\".\nLight and reason.\nYellow, as the color of sunlight when sun is near the horizon, is commonly associated with warmth. Yellow combined with red symbolized heat and energy. A room painted yellow feels warmer than a room painted white, and a lamp with yellow light seems more natural than a lamp with white light.\nAs the color of light, yellow is also associated with knowledge and wisdom. In English and many other languages, \"brilliant\" and \"bright\" mean intelligent. In Islam, the yellow color of gold symbolizes wisdom. In medieval European symbolism, red symbolized passion, blue symbolized the spiritual, and yellow symbolized reason. In many European universities, yellow gowns and caps are worn by members of the faculty of physical and natural sciences, as yellow is the color of reason and research.\nGold and blond.\nIn ancient Greece and Rome, the gods were often depicted with yellow, or blonde hair, which was described in literature as 'golden'. The color yellow was associated with the sun gods Helios and Apollo. It was fashionable in ancient Greece for men and women to dye their hair yellow, or to spend time in the sun to bleach it. In ancient Rome, prostitutes were required to bleach their hair, to be easily identified, but it also became a fashionable hair color for aristocratic women, influenced by the exotic blonde hair of many of the newly conquered slaves from Gaul, Britain, and Germany. However, in medieval Europe and later, the word yellow often had negative connotations; associated with betrayal, so yellow hair was more poetically called 'blond,' 'light', 'fair,' or most often \"golden\".\nVisibility and caution.\nYellow is the most visible color from a distance, so it is often used for objects that need to be seen, such as fire engines, road maintenance equipment, school buses and taxicabs. It is also often used for warning signs, since yellow traditionally signals caution, rather than danger. Safety yellow is often used for safety and accident prevention information. A yellow light on a traffic signal means slow down, but not stop. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) uses Pantone 116 (a yellow hue) as their standard color implying \"general warning\", while the Federal Highway Administration similarly uses yellow to communicate warning or caution on highway signage. A yellow penalty card in a soccer match means warning, but not expulsion. The use of yellow paint in video games to draw the player's attention to a specific spot continues to be debated.\nOptimism and pleasure.\nYellow is the color most associated with optimism and pleasure; it is a color designed to attract attention, and is used for amusement. Yellow dresses in fashion are rare, but always associated with gaiety and celebration.\nMayan and Italian.\nThe ancient Maya associated the color yellow with the direction South. The Maya glyph for \"yellow\" (k'an) also means \"precious\" or \"ripe\".\n\"Giallo\", in Italian, refers to crime stories, both fictional and real. This association began in about 1930, when the first series of crime novels published in Italy had yellow covers.\nSelected national and international flags.\nThree of the ten most populous countries in the world (China, India and Brazil) have yellow or gold in their flag, representing about half of the world's population. While many flags use yellow, their symbolism varies widely, from civic virtue to golden treasure, golden fields, the desert, royalty, the keys to Heaven and the leadership of the Communist Party. In classic European heraldry, yellow, along with white, is one of the two metals (called gold and silver) and therefore flags following heraldic design rules must use either yellow or white to separate any of their other colors (see the rule of tincture and insignia).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It consisted of two constituent states, the Republic of Serbia and the Republic of Montenegro.\nThe total population of Serbia and Montenegro at the time of its dissolution in 2006 was approximately 9,746,130 with Serbia having 9,131,105 and Montenegro having 615,025 then. In 2000, in Serbia, 19.95% of the population was 14 and under (male 1,028,355; female 963,366); in Montenegro, it was 22.05% (male 77,582; female 72,395). 65.22% of Serbians (male 3,187,746; female 3,322,425) and 66.16% of Montenegrins (male 222,095; female 227,923) were between 15 and 64. 14.83% of Serbians (male 638,204; female 841,833) and 11.79% of Montenegrins (male 32,400; female 47,763) were 65 and over.\nEstimates in 2000 placed Serbia's population growth rate at 0.739% and Montenegro's at -12.22%. The respective birth rates were 12.20/1000 (Serbia) and 14.9/1000 (Montenegro); death rates were 11.08/1000 (Serbia) and 7.9/1000 (Montenegro). The net migration rate was 6.29/1000 in Serbia and -29.18/1,000 in Montenegro. Total fertility rates were 1.7 children/woman in Serbia and 2.0 children/woman in Montenegro.\nIn 2000, Serbia's infant mortality rate was 20.13 deaths/1,000 live births; Montenegro's was 10.97 deaths/1,000 live births. Total life expectancy at birth was 72.39 years in Serbia (69.31 for males, 75.72 for females) and 75.46 in Montenegro (71.45 for males, 79.82 for females).\nEthnic groups in the region were represented as follows: Serb 62.6%, Albanian 16.5%, Montenegrin 5%, Yugoslav 3.4%, Hungarian 3.3%, other 9.2% (as of 2001). In terms of religion, 65% of inhabitants were Eastern Orthodox, 19% Muslim, 4% Roman Catholic, 1% Protestant 1%, and 11% other. The main languages spoken in Serbia and Montenegro are Serbian, Albanian, Croatian, Bosnian and Hungarian.\nIn 2002, 96.4% of the population aged 15 and over could read and write (98.9% of males, 94.1% of females).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;"}
{"id": "34372", "revid": "194203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34372", "title": "Politics of Serbia and Montenegro", "text": "The Politics of Serbia and Montenegro, known as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, later renamed as Serbia and Montenegro, took place in a framework of a federal parliamentary republic with a multi-party system, and after 2003, in the context of a confederation. The president was head of state and, following constitutional reforms in 2003, simultaneously head of government. Executive power was exercised by the Council of Ministers. Federal legislative power was vested in the Serbia-Montenegro Parliament.\nHistory.\nIn January 1998, Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107 became president of Montenegro, following the bitterly contested presidential election in November 1997, which were pronounced free and fair by international monitors. His coalition followed up with the parliamentary election in May. Having weathered Milo\u0161evi\u0107's campaign to undermine his government, \u0110ukanovi\u0107 struggled to balance the pro-independence stance of his coalition with the changed domestic and international environment of the post-October 5 country. In December 2002, \u0110ukanovi\u0107 resigned as president and was appointed Prime Minister. The new President of Montenegro became Filip Vujanovi\u0107.\nBefore the October 5 overthrow as opposition grew, Milo\u0161evi\u0107 continued to hold significant power. Although his political party, the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS) (in electoral cartel with Mirjana Markovic' Yugoslav Left), did not enjoy a majority in either the federal or Serbian parliaments, it dominated the governing coalitions and held all the key administrative posts. An essential element of Milo\u0161evi\u0107's grasp on power was his control of the police. Routine federal elections in September 2000 resulted in Vojislav Ko\u0161tunica, leader of the Democratic Opposition of Serbia block - receiving less than a majority, requiring a second round. Immediately, street protests and rallies filled cities across the country as the nation rallied around Vojislav Ko\u0161tunica, the recently formed candidate for FRY president. There had been widespread fear that the second round would be canceled on the basis of foreign interference in the elections.\nOn 5 October 2000, Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 was forced to concede defeat after days of mass protests across Serbia. New FRY President Vojislav Ko\u0161tunica was supported by Zoran \u0110in\u0111i\u0107, who was elected Prime Minister of Serbia in the December 2000 republican elections. After an initial honeymoon period in the wake of October 5, DSS and the rest of DOS, led by \u0110in\u0111i\u0107 and his DS, found themselves increasingly at odds over the nature and pace of the governments' reform programs. By mid-2002, Ko\u0161tunica and \u0110in\u0111i\u0107 were openly at odds over the direction of the country's future. Ko\u0161tunica's party, having informally withdrawn from all DOS decision-making bodies, was agitating for early elections in an effort to force \u0110in\u0111i\u0107 from the scene. After the initial euphoria of replacing Milo\u0161evi\u0107, the population in reaction to this political maneuvering, was sliding into apathy and disillusionment with its leading politicians. This political stalemate continued for much of 2002, and reform initiatives stalled. Finally in February 2003, the Constitutional Charter was ratified by both republics, and Yugoslavia became a confederacy. Under the new Constitutional Charter, most federal functions and authorities devolved to the republic level. Svetozar Marovi\u0107 was elected as the new president of Yugoslavia.\nOn 6 February 2003, the country became a confederation pursuant to amendments agreed the previous year. This was to be a confederacy with more powers devolved to the constituent republics, Montenegro and Serbia, operating as a commonwealth. The central government largely became a ceremonial outfit.\nOn 12 March 2003, Serbia\u2032s prime minister Zoran \u0110in\u0111i\u0107 was assassinated. The newly formed confederate government of Yugoslavia reacted swiftly by calling a state of emergency and undertaking an unprecedented crackdown on organized crime which led to the arrest of more than 4,000 people.\nOn 3 June 2006, Montenegro declared independence. On 5 June 2006, Serbia also declared independence, thus ending the 88 year old unity of the two Serbian countries - Serbia and Montenegro.\nExecutive branch.\nThe president was elected by the Parliament for a four-year term. He chaired the Council of Ministers, composed of five members.\nLegislative branch.\nThe Assembly of Serbia and Montenegro (\"Skup\u0161tina Srbije i Crne Gore\") had 126 members elected for a four-year term, 91 in Serbia and 35 in Montenegro. The first parliament was elected 25 February 2003 by the members of the old federal and the republican parliaments. Mandates were divided among parties and coalitions in proportion to the number of their benches in Serbia's and Montenegro's parliaments. Every time one of the parliaments was re-elected, the composition changes.\nJudicial branch.\nThe FR Yugoslavia had a Federal Court and a Constitutional Court. Judges were elected by the Federal Assembly for nine-year terms. After the promulgation of the new Constitution, the Federal Court would've had constitutional and administrative functions; it would've had an equal number of judges from each republic.\nInternational organizations membership.\nABEDA, BIS, CE (guest), CEI, EBRD, FAO, G-77, IAEA, IBRD, ICAO, ICC, ICCt, ICFTU, ICRM, IDA, IFAD, IFC, IFRCS, IHO, ILO, IMF, IMO, Interpol, IOC, IOM, ISO, ITU, NAM (guest), OAS (observer), OPCW, OSCE, PCA, UN, UNCTAD, UNESCO, UNHCR, UNIDO, UNMISET, UPU, WCL, WCO, WHO, WIPO, WMO, UNWTO, WTO (observer)."}
{"id": "34373", "revid": "6496055", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34373", "title": "Economy of Serbia and Montenegro", "text": "As the economy of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia collapsed and entered a prolonged decline in 1989, the country broke up into five new sovereign states by 1992, independence of which was fought over in a series of Yugoslav Wars. The rump state that continued to designate itself as 'Yugoslavia' (Federated Republic of) was established as a confederation of two of these successor states, Serbia and Montenegro.\nWith hyperinflation exacerbated by the economic sanctions imposed during the Bosnian War, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) economy's downward spiral showed no real sign of recovery until 1995. GDP was nowhere near its 1990 level, but the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia of the basic infrastructure of the country and many factories, as well as a renewed embargo, caused a further huge drop in GDP in relation to the 1991 level. The first sign of an economic recovery occurred in 2001 after the overthrow of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, which occurred on 5 October 2000. A vigorous team of economic reformers worked to tame inflation (non-energy inflation is less than 9% in 2002, down from over 120% two years earlier) and rationalize the Serbian and Montenegrin economy. By January 2005, GDP recovered to 55-60% of its 1990 level, due to GDP growth of 8.5% in 2004.\nFollowing the 2006 Montenegrin independence referendum, the union dissolved as Montenegro became an independent country. Thereafter, the economy of Montenegro and economy of Serbia would follow different trajectories.\nHyperinflation.\nThe FRY's monetary unit, the dinar, remained volatile throughout Milo\u0161evi\u0107's rule. Alarmed FRY officials took several steps to tighten monetary policy in 1998, including ruling out a devaluation in the near term, increasing reserve requirements, and issuing bonds. During this period, Montenegro rejected the dinar and adopted the Deutsche Mark (now replaced by the euro) as its official currency. As 1999 began, the damage control operation had succeeded in returning the exchange rate to reasonable levels. However, it was not until 2002, after intense macroeconomic reform measures, that the dinar became convertible\u2014a first since the Bretton Woods Agreements laid out the post-World War II international exchange rate regime.\nStabilization efforts.\nPrivatization efforts have not succeeded as well as macroeconomic reform. The process of privatization was not popular among workers of large socially owned companies, and many citizens appeared to believe the tendering process was overly centralized and controlled from Belgrade. Furthermore, international investment was lagging in Serbia and Montenegro, as a result of both domestic and international investment climates. Managers tended to blame the dearth of interest on the current negative business climate in Serbia and Montenegro.\nStatistics.\nGross Domestic Product.\nPurchasing power parity - $25.98 billion (2004 est.)&lt;, $27.5 Billion predicted for 2005 br&gt;\nReal growth rate: 8.5% (2004 est.), 6.5% (2005 est)&lt;br&gt;\nReal GDP Per capita - nominal: $2900 (2004 est.), $3200 (2005 est.)&lt;br&gt;\nComposition by sector:\nAgriculture: 15.2%\nIndustry: 28.2%\nServices: 56.6% (2004 est.)\nEconomic Situation.\nPopulation below poverty line: 10%&lt;br&gt;\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 12-13% (2004 est.) &lt;br&gt;\nLabor force: 3,596,282 (2005 est.)&lt;br&gt;\nBudget:\nRevenues: $9.773 billion\nexpenditures: $10.460 billion (2004 est.)\nIndustrial Situation.\nIndustries:\nmachine building (aircraft, trucks, and automobiles; tanks and weapons; electrical equipment; agricultural machinery); metallurgy (steel, aluminum, copper, lead, zinc, chromium, antimony, bismuth, cadmium); mining (coal, bauxite, nonferrous ore, iron ore, limestone); consumer goods (textiles, footwear, foodstuffs, appliances); electronics, petroleum products, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals\nIndustrial production growth rate: 6.5% (2004 est.)\nElectricity.\nIn 2023, electricity production was valued at $53.2 million.\nProduction: 31,710 GWh (2001)&lt;br&gt;\nProduction by source (2001):\nFossil fuel: 62.9%\nHydro: 37.1%\nNuclear: 0%\nOther: 0%\nConsumption: 32,370 GWh (2001)&lt;br&gt;\nExports: 446 GWh (2001)&lt;br&gt;\nImports: 3,330 GWh (2001)\nOil.\nProduction: 2001&lt;br&gt;\nConsumption: 2001&lt;br&gt;\nExports: NA (2001)&lt;br&gt;\nImports: NA (2001)&lt;br&gt;\nProved reserves: January 2002\nNatural Gas.\nProved reserves: 24.07\u00a0km3 (January 2002 est.)\nAgricultural Produce.\nCereals, fruits, vegetables, tobacco, olives; cattle, sheep, goats.\nExports.\nTotal: $5.5 billion f.o.b.

Domestic line system is 100% digital, with digital cable trunk line connecting switching centres. A drop in fixed-line connections in the last decade has been more than offset by a sharp increase in mobile-cellular telephone use. Telekom Srbija, the former state monopoly, is the predominant player in landline telephony with 93.8% of market share. Since the liberalization of the telecommunications market in 2013, Telekom Srbija has been very slowly losing market share to 16 other telecom operators, of which the most significant ones include SBB and Orion Telekom.\nMobile telephony.\nAs of December 2023 Serbia has three mobile networks, Telekom Srbija, Yettel, and A1, all of which are licensed for 2G GSM, 3G UMTS, and 4G LTE. The largest mobile operator is Telekom Srbija, marketed as \"mts\", with 44.1% market share, followed by Yettel with 31.9% and A1 with 24% market share. In addition, SBB gained mobile virtual network operator licence in 2013 but is still not offering services.\nRadio and television.\nFree-to-air terrestrial television.\nDigital television transition has been completed in 2015 with MPEG-4 compression standard and DVB-T2 standard for signal transmission.\nPay television.\nSome 67% of households are provided with pay television services (i.e. 38.7% cable television, 16.9% IPTV, and 10.4% satellite). There are 90 pay television operators (cable, IPTV, DTH), largest of which are SBB (mainly cable) with 48% market share, Telekom Srbija (\"mts TV\") with 25%, followed by Po\u0161taNet with 5%, and Ikom and Kopernikus with 4% and 3%, respectively.\nIT Industry.\nThe Serbian IT industry is rapidly growing and changing pace. In 2018, IT services exports reached $1.3 billion. With 6,924 companies in the IT sector (2013 data[ [update]]), Belgrade is one of the information technology centres in this part of Europe, with strong growth. The Microsoft Development Center in Belgrade was, at the time of its establishment, the fifth such centre in the world. Many worlds IT companies choose Belgrade as regional or European centre such as Asus, Intel, Dell, Huawei, NCR, Ubisoft etc. These companies have taken advantage of Serbia's large pool of engineers and relatively low wages.\nLarge investments by global tech companies like Microsoft, typical of the 2000s, are being eclipsed by a growing number of domestic startups which obtain funding from domestic and international investors. What brought companies like Microsoft in the first place was a large pool of talented engineers and mathematicians. In just the first quarter of 2016, more than US$65 million has been raised by Serbian startups including $45 million for Seven Bridges (a Bioinformatics firm) and $14 million for Vast (a data analysis firm). One of the most successful startups have been Nordeus which was founded in Belgrade in 2010 and is one of Europe's fastest-growing companies in the field of computer games (the developer of Top Eleven Football Manager, a game played by over 20 million people).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Opened as early as 1950, it became the backbone of Yugoslav road system, and linked Belgrade through Zagreb and Ljubljana with Austrian border, and through Ni\u0161 and Skopje with Greek border. It became the main road link between Central Europe and South-Eastern Europe and Middle East. Nowadays, the section going from Belgrade to the Croatian border is known as the A3, and links Serbia directly by motorway to Slovenia, Italy, Austria and the rest of Western Europe. While the section linking Belgrade to Ni\u0161 and further to the border with North Macedonia is the A1 motorway and stretches all the way until Athens, passing through Skopje and Thessaloniki. With the break-up of Yugoslavia and the geostrategical change, the A1 was linked with the motorway linking Belgrade further North towards Novi Sad, Subotica and the border with Hungary going all way until Budapest. In Ni\u0161, the motorway has an extension that runs through Pirot towards the border with Bulgaria, linking it further with Bulgarian capital Sofia and running all the way until Istanbul becoming the most accessible motorway linking the Balkans with Turkey, Middle East and rest of Asia.\nRail transport.\nIn March 2015, the Government of Serbia announced its plan to establish three additional new railway companies, splitting the Serbian Railways in separate businesses. Those companies are: Srbija Voz operating passenger transport, Srbija Kargo operating cargo transport and Serbian Railways Infrastructure operating as infrastructure management company.\nRail remains a popular mode for freight transportation with 12.3 million tons carried in 2018. Passenger services are less utilized, carrying just over 16 million passengers in 2018 plus the 5 million riderships in the Belgrade urban rail system.\nThe railway system in Serbia consists of 3,739\u00a0km of rails, of which 295\u00a0km is double track (7.9% of the network). 33.6% of the network (1,279\u00a0km) is electrified. Railroads are categorized as either main lines, regional lines, local lines or sidings. Serbia has rail links with all of its neighbouring countries.\nAir transport.\nThere are in total 39 airports and 2 heliports in Serbia. In addition, three airports are with regular passenger traffic service: Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport, Ni\u0161 Constantine the Great Airport and Kraljevo Morava Airport.The total air traffic in 2022 reached 6,014,625 passengers and 20 thousand tons in annual cargo tonnage. This figure includes all three airports with schedule international and domestic flights.\nAirports of Serbia is Public Enterprise company owned by the Government of Serbia for the purpose of better and more efficient management of the airports in the whole country. The company currently manages 5 airports in Serbia and 1 in Bosnia and Hercegovina. VINCI Airports took over Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport under concession at the end of 2018. from the state for a period of 25 years.\nThe national carrier of the Republic of Serbia is Air Serbia, a legacy carrier which carried some 2.75 million passengers in 2022 flying to the total of 80 domestic and international destinations in more than 30 countries. This includes intercontinental flights to New York City, Chicago and Tianjin. Beside Air Serbia, other established airline companies that fly to Serbia include Lufthansa, Air France, Turkish Airlines, Aeroflot, Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways, Alitalia, Austrian Airlines, Swiss International Air Lines, and LOT Polish Airlines. Currently, the following low-cost airlines are flying to Serbia: Ryanair, EasyJet, Wizz Air, Transavia and Norwegian Air Shuttle.\nHistorical preview.\nSerbia was among the pioneers in mail, freight and passenger air transport. The first airfields were inaugurated in 1910. In 1914, the Banjica airfield was the base for the Serbian Air Force squadron and the Balloon Company. After the end of the First World War, the Banjica airfield was used for airmail traffic and included the routes Novi Sad\u2013Belgrade\u2013Ni\u0161\u2013Skoplje and Belgrade\u2013Sarajevo\u2013Mostar. Regular passenger transport greatly expanded with the creation of Aeroput in 1927 which became the Yugoslav flag-carrier and with over 30 planes and having its hub in Belgrade, it became the 21st airline in the world. It linked Belgrade and other Serbian cities such as Ni\u0161 and Podujevo with destinations all around Yugoslavia and also with the main airports in Austria, Albania, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Hungary, Italy, Romania and Greece. As early as 1923 foreign companies started regular routes that included Belgrade. Besides Aeroput, Air France, Deutsche Luft Hansa, KLM, Imperial Airways and airlines from Italy, Austria, Hungary, Romania and Poland also used the airport until the outbreak of the Second World War. It was one of them, the CFRNA, that on its route linking Belgrade with Paris and Bucharest, in 1923, that made the first world night flight ever in history. The constantly increasing number of passengers made inevitable the building of a modern airport in 1931, which included a modern terminal building and top landing equipment for poor visibility conditions, that were installed in 1936.\nAt the end of Second World War the country changed from a monarchy to a communist regime. Aeroput was rebranded as JAT Yugoslav Airlines and the reconstruction of the much destroyed infrastructure begin. After Tito\u2013Stalin Split in 1948, Yugoslavia became one of the leaders of the Non-Aligned Movement. Following this policy, JAT inaugurated inter-continental flights linking capital Belgrade with all five continents. Its geopolitical position made it able to acquire both, West and East build aircraft. A new modern airport, the Belgrade international airport was inaugurated in 1962. Belgrade became a national and regional hub. Besides JAT, a number of other charter and regional airlines were created, with Aviogenex being the one based in Belgrade. Also, Adria Airways, partially owned by Serbian company InterExport, included numerous flights linking Belgrade with different destinations around the world. During SFRY period Belgrade was linked with flights to destinations as far as Sydney, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, Beijing, Johannesburg, New York, Chicago, Montreal or Toronto. Passengers from the region could access all these destinations through connection flights through Belgrade.\nThe air transport industry was in continuous growth and expansion until the beginning of the Yugoslav wars and the break-up of Yugoslavia. During the war, severe sanctions were imposed upon Serbia and Montenegro which included no-flight zone over Serbia and prohibition of international flights to and from Serbia and Montenegro. This was a major set-back for Serbian airline industry. It will be only after Kosovo War and overthrow of Milosevic that by year 2000 air transport industry started to recover.\nWater transport.\nSerbia has a fairly developed inland water transport which carried over 2 million tons of cargo in 2016. There are 1,716 kilometers of navigable inland waterways (1,043\u00a0km of navigable rivers and 673\u00a0km of navigable canals), which are almost all located in northern third of the country. The most important inland waterway is the Danube, that is part of Pan-European Corridor VII. Other navigable rivers in Serbia include Sava, Tisza, Begej and Timi\u015f River, all of which connect Serbia with Northern and Western Europe through the Rhine\u2013Main\u2013Danube Canal and North Sea route. To Eastern Europe Serbia is connected via the Begej and Danube via Black Sea route, and to Southern Europe via the Sava river.\nImportant ports on Danube river are: Port of Novi Sad (1.18 million tons of cargo tonnage in 2016) and Port of Belgrade are the largest, while other river ports on the same river include: Pan\u010devo, Smederevo, Prahovo, Apatin and Ba\u010dka Palanka. On Sava river, \u0160abac Port is the most significant and on Begej river that is Senta Port.\nMerchant river fleet include 149 ships: 146 cargo vessels (with total capacity of 173 thousand tons) and 3 passenger ships.\nPipelines.\n \nThrough pipeline network some 6.2 million tons of gas and oil were transported in 2018. The natural gas transportation system comprises 3,177 kilometers of trunk and regional natural gas pipelines with 450 million cubic meter underground gas storage facility at Banatski Dvor. There are 155 kilometers of crude oil pipelines connecting Pan\u010devo and Novi Sad refineries as a part of trans-national Adria oil pipeline.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

From 1992 to 2003, the \"VSCG\" was called the Yugoslav Army (, lit.\u2009'Army [of] Yugoslavia'), created from the remnants of the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA), the military of SFR Yugoslavia until the country disbanded. The rump state, then named Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, participated in the Yugoslav Wars with limited direct intervention of its own armed forces. Following the end of the Wars and the constitutional reforms of 2003 by which the state was renamed \"Serbia and Montenegro\", the military accordingly changed its name. The military was heavily involved in combating Albanian separatists during the Kosovo War and Pre\u0161evo Valley conflict, and also engaged NATO warplanes during the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.\nUpon the dissolution of Serbia and Montenegro with the Montenegrin independence referendum (2006), a fraction of the joint military was given to Montenegro, with the bulk of the force remaining in Serbia. Montenegro inherited the navy as Serbia is landlocked.\nOrganization.\nVJ.\nThe Army (or Armed Forces) of Yugoslavia (VJ) was organized into the following:\nAir Force.\nThe inventory included MiG-21 (fighter/recon/trainer), MiG-29 (fighter/trainer), Soko J-22 (ground/recon/trainer), Soko G-2 (fighter/bomber/trainer), Soko G-4 (fighter/bomber/target/trainer, Antonov An-2 (cargo), Antonov An-26 (cargo), Yakovlev Yak-40 (VIP), Mil Mi-8 (multirole), Mil Mi-14 (anti-submarine), Kamov Ka-25 (anti-submarine), Kamov Ka-28 (anti-submarine), A\u00e9rospatiale Gazelle (attack/utility/recon).\nNavy.\nMilitary unit\nThe Navy, officially called the War Navy of the Army of Yugoslavia () from 1992 to 2003 and the War Navy of Serbia and Montenegro () from 2003 to 2006, was based in Kotor and was largely made of vessels inherited from the pre-1992 Yugoslav War Navy (). During NATO's Operation Allied Force in 1999, the Navy took control over civilian shipping around Kotor, despite NATO's blockade and in several actions the navy's warships fired at NATO aircraft that were on their way to strike Yugoslav targets. The Navy claimed to have shot down three UAVs over Boka Kotorska.

While the country was involved in Yugoslav Wars and therefore exposed to several rounds of devastating sanctions against Yugoslavia this involvement was often denied for political or ideological reasons. In the initial period Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FR Yugoslavia) unsuccessfully aspired to gain international recognition as the sole legal successor state to SFR Yugoslavia, the country which was one of the most prominent foreign policy subjects during the Cold War.\nUnwilling to accept the interpretation that it is a new state that shares succession with other former SFR Yugoslav republics, FR Yugoslavia rejected to reapply for membership in international organizations leading the country to international isolation and it sometimes being described as a pariah state until the overthrow of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 in 2000. International status of the country improved somewhat following the 1995 Dayton Peace Agreement which ended Bosnian War and 1995 Erdut Agreement which opened the space for mutual recognition and establishment of full diplomatic relations with Croatia in 1996. This improvement was nevertheless not long lasting with the beginning of Kosovo War and 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.\nFollowing the overthrow of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 on 5 October 2000 and the victory of Democratic Opposition of Serbia led by new Prime Minister of Serbia Zoran \u0110in\u0111i\u0107 and the new President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Vojislav Ko\u0161tunica, the country has worked to stabilize and strengthen its bilateral relationships with neighboring countries and the world. The country has joined multiple international organizations such as the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and the United Nations and is actively participating in International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank projects.\nFollowing the 2006 Montenegrin independence referendum which led to the dissolution of the state union two constituents (Republic of Serbia and Republic of Montenegro) agreed on Serbian sole succession of rights and obligations of the FR Yugoslavia with foreign relations of Serbia directly continuing all memberships in international organizations, inheriting federal properties (for example embassies) and accessions to various . \"Memorandum of Agreement\" reached on 30 November 2006 additionally ensures Serbian provision of consular services to the Montenegrin citizens on the territory of states in which Montenegro has no missions of its own.\nHistory.\nIn spring and summer 2002, Yugoslavia resolved its longstanding border dispute with Republic of Macedonia. Although a difficult political issue domestically, the country has established a solid working relationship with the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and has released all disputed ethnic Albanian prisoners from Kosovo to the competent UN bodies.\nIn 2002, the government established a commission to coordinate cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and began serving warrants for the arrest of indicted war criminals who have sought refuge in the country. The crackdown on organized crime following the assassination of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran \u0110in\u0111i\u0107; also resulted in the apprehension and transfer to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in Hague of several persons indicted for war crimes.\nImmediately preceding the NATO bombing campaign of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in spring 1999, the U.S. and most European countries severed relations with Yugoslavia, and the U.S. embassy was closed. Since October 5, 2000, foreign embassies, including that of the U.S., have reopened, and the country has regained its seat in such international organizations as the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and the United Nations and is actively participating in International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank projects. As of summer 2003, Serbia and Montenegro has been admitted to the Council of Europe and has indicated that it wishes to join NATO's Partnership for Peace.\nForeign aid.\nSubsequent to the outbreak of hostilities with NATO, Belgrade received no foreign aid from the United States and west European countries, but has received much aid from other countries such as Russia, China, and Greece. Since October 2000, however, the European Union aid has steadily increased, and U.S. restrictions on aid have fallen away as the union of Serbia and Montenegro stepped forward to meet its international obligations. In June 2003, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell was able to certify that Serbia and Montenegro relationship with the Republika Srpska was consistent with the Dayton Accords, had released all political prisoners, and was cooperating with the ICTY. As a result, the United States is now free to release aid money and support Serbia and Montenegro in international financial institutions, such as the IMF and World Bank. Total U.S. aid to Serbia and Montenegro, including debt forgiveness, exceeded $180 million in fiscal year 2002. The U.S. is the single-largest donor of aid to Serbia and Montenegro.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It descends from the Insular G, the form of the letter \"g\" in the medieval Insular script, \u1d79.\nIn Middle English writing, tailed z came to be indistinguishable from yogh.\nIn Middle Scots, the character yogh became confused with a cursive z and the early Scots printers often used z when yogh was not available in their fonts. Consequently, some Modern Scots words have a \"z\" in place of a yogh\u2014the common surname Menzies was originally written Men\u021dies (nowadays pronounced \"mingis\" but originally \"menyers\", from the French \"menieres\").\nYogh is shaped similarly to the Cyrillic letter \u0417 and the Arabic numeral 3, which are sometimes substituted for the character in online reference works. There is some confusion about the letter in the literature, as the English language was far from standardised at the time.

In Middle English, it also stood for the phoneme and its allophone [\u00e7] as in \u27e8\u27e9 'night' (), and also represented the phonemes /j/ and /d\u0292/. Sometimes yogh stood for or , as in the word \u27e8\u27e9 'yowling'.\nIn Middle Scots, it represented the sound in the clusters , and , written \"l\" and \"n\".\nIn medieval Cornish manuscripts, yogh was used to represent the voiced dental fricative , as in \u27e8\u27e9, now written \u27e8dhodho\u27e9, pronounced .\nHistory.\nOld English.\nThe original Germanic \"g\" sound was expressed by the gyfu rune in the Anglo-Saxon futhorc (which is itself sometimes rendered as in modern transliteration). Following palatalization, both \"gyfu\" and Latin \"g\" in Old English expressed the sound before front vowels. For example, \"year\" was written as \"gear\", even though the word had never had a \"g\" sound (deriving from Proto-Germanic \"*j\u0113r\u0105\").\nWith the re-introduced possibility of a sound before front vowels, notably in the form of loanwords from the Old Norse (such as \"gere\" from Norse \"gervi\", Modern English \"gear\"), this orthographical state of affairs became a source of confusion, and a distinction of \"real \"g\"\" () from \"palatalized \"g\"\" () became desirable.\nIn the Old English period, \u1d79 was simply the way Latin \"g\" was written in the Insular script introduced at the Christianisation of England by the Hiberno-Scottish mission. It only came to be used as a letter distinct from \"g\" in the Middle English period, where it evolved in appearance into \u021d, now considered a separate character.\nMiddle English.\nIn the 14th century, the digraph \"gh\" arose as an alternative to yogh for /x/, and eventually overtook yogh in popularity; still, the variety of pronunciations persisted, as evidenced by \"cough\", \"taught\", and \"though\". The process of replacing the yogh with \"gh\" was slow, and was not completed until the arrival of printing presses (which lacked yogh) in England around the end of the fifteenth century. Not every English word that contains a \"gh\" was originally spelled with a yogh: for example, \"spaghetti\" is Italian, where the \"h\" makes the \"g\" hard (i.e., instead of ); \"ghoul\" is Arabic, in which the \"gh\" was .\nThe medieval author Orm used this letter in three ways when writing Early Middle English. By itself, it represented , so he used this letter for the \"y\" in \"yet\". Doubled, it represented , so he ended his spelling of \"may\" with two yoghs. Finally, the digraph of \"\u021dh\" represented .\nIn the late Middle English period, yogh was no longer used: came to be spelled \"night\".

Yogh was also used to represent in words such as , \" (yesterday) and \" but by the Modern Scots period \"y\" had replaced yogh. The pronunciation of MacKenzie (and its variant spellings) (from Scottish Gaelic ), originally pronounced in Scots, shows where yogh became z. Menzies Campbell is another example.\nAfter the development of printing.\nIn Middle Scots orthography, the use of yogh became confused with a cursive \"z\" and the early Scots printers often used \"z\" when yogh was not available in their fonts.\nThe yogh glyph can be found in surnames that start with a \"Y\" in Scotland and Ireland; for example the surname Yeoman, which would have been spelled . Sometimes, the yogh would be replaced by the letter \"z\", because the shape of the yogh was identical to some forms of handwritten \"z\".\nIn Unicode 1.0, the character yogh was mistakenly unified with the quite different character ezh (\u01b7 \u0292), and yogh itself was not added to Unicode until version 3.0.\nExamples of Middle English words containing a yogh.\nThese are examples of Middle English words that contain the letter yogh in their spellings.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nScots words with \u27e8z\u27e9 for \u27e8\u021d\u27e9.\nPlacenames.\nSee also:\nSurnames.\nSee also:\nIn Egyptology.\nA Unicode-based transliteration system adopted by the Institut Fran\u00e7ais d'Arch\u00e9ologie Orientale suggested the use of the yogh \u021d character as the transliteration of the Ancient Egyptian \"aleph\" glyph: A\nThe symbol actually used in Egyptology is , two half-rings opening to the left.

As a member of his Party's Pre-Revolutionary underground, Zamyatin was repeatedly arrested, beaten, imprisoned, and exiled. But Zamyatin was just as deeply disturbed by the policies pursued by the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) following the October Revolution as he had been by Tsarist policy.\nDue to his subsequent use of literature to both satirize and criticize the Soviet Union's enforced conformity and increasing totalitarianism, Zamyatin, whom Mirra Ginsburg has dubbed \"a man of incorruptible and uncompromising courage,\" is now considered one of the first Soviet dissidents. He is most famous for his highly influential and widely imitated 1921 dystopian science fiction novel \"We\", which is set in a futuristic police state.\nIn 1921, \"We\" became the first work banned by the Soviet censorship board. Ultimately, Zamyatin arranged for \"We\" to be smuggled to the West for publication. The outrage this sparked within the Party and the Union of Soviet Writers led directly to the State-organized defamation and blacklisting of Zamyatin and his successful request for permission from Joseph Stalin to leave his homeland. In 1937 he died in poverty in Paris.\nAfter his death, Zamyatin's writings were circulated in \"samizdat\" and continued to inspire multiple generations of Soviet dissidents.\nEarly life.\nZamyatin was born in Lebedyan, Tambov Governorate, south of Moscow. His father was a Russian Orthodox priest and schoolmaster, and his mother a musician. In a 1922 essay, Zamyatin recalled: \"You will see a very lonely child, without companions of his own age, on his stomach, over a book, or under the piano, on which his mother is playing Chopin.\" Zamyatin may have had synesthesia since he gave letters and sounds qualities. He saw the letter \u041b as having pale, cold and light blue qualities.\nHe studied engineering for the Imperial Russian Navy in Saint Petersburg, from 1902 until 1908. During this time, Zamyatin lost his faith in Christianity, became an atheist and a Marxist, and joined the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party.\n1905: Revolt and repression.\nZamyatin later recalled the Russian Revolution of 1905 as follows: \"In those years, being a Bolshevik meant following the line of greatest resistance, and I was a Bolshevik at that time. In the fall of 1905 there were strikes, and the dark Nevsky Prospekt was pierced by a searchlight from the Admiralty Building. October 17. Meetings in the universities.\"\nIn December 1905, Zamyatin agreed to hide in his flat a paper bag filled with the explosive pyroxylin. The following day, he and thirty other Bolsheviks were arrested by the Okhrana inside their \"revolutionary headquarters of the Vyborg district, at the very moment when plans and pistols of various types were spread out on the table.\"\nAfter being arrested and beaten up, Zamyatin managed to smuggle a note out of the prison, instructing his fellow Bolsheviks, \"to remove everything compromising from my room and the rooms of my four comrades.\" Although this was immediately done, Zamyatin did not know of it until much later. During the months he spent in solitary confinement, Zamyatin recalled that he had almost daily nightmares about the paper bag in his flat containing pyroxylin.\nIn the spring of 1906, Zamyatin was released and sent into exile in his native Tambov Governorate. However, Zamyatin later wrote that he could not stand life among the devoutly Russian Orthodox peasantry of Lebedyan. Therefore, he escaped and returned to Saint Petersburg where he lived illegally before moving to Helsinki, in the Grand Duchy of Finland.\nAfter illegally returning to St. Petersburg, \"disguised, clean-shaven, with a pince-nez astride my nose,\" Zamyatin began to write fiction as a hobby. He was arrested and exiled a second time in 1911. He later recalled, \"I lived first in an empty dacha at Sestroretsk, then, in winter, in Lakhta. There amidst snow, solitude, quiet, I wrote \"A Provincial Tale\".\"\nReturn to St. Petersburg, visit to England.\nIn 1913, Zamyatin was granted an amnesty as part of the celebrations for 300 years of rule by the House of Romanov and granted the right to return to St. Petersburg. His \"A Provincial Tale\", which satirized life in a small Russian town, was immediately published and brought him a degree of fame. The next year he was tried and acquitted for defaming the Imperial Russian Army in his story \"Na Kulichkakh\" (\"At the World's End\"). He continued to contribute articles to Marxist newspapers. After graduating as an engineer for the Imperial Russian Navy, Zamyatin worked professionally at home and abroad.\nIn March 1916, he was sent to England to supervise the construction of icebreakers at the shipyards of Armstrong Whitworth in Walker and Swan Hunter in Wallsend while living in Newcastle upon Tyne. He supervised the building of the \"Krassin\", which retained the distinction of being the most powerful icebreaker in the world into the 1950s. He also worked on the \"Lenin\".\nZamyatin later wrote, \"My only previous visit to the West had been to Germany. Berlin had impressed me as a condensed, 80-percent version of Petersburg. In England it was quite different: everything was as new and strange as Alexandria and Jerusalem had been some years before.\"\nZamyatin later recalled, \"In England, I built ships, looked at ruined castles, listened to the thud of bombs dropped by German Zeppelins, and wrote \"The Islanders\". I regret that I did not see the February Revolution, and know only the October Revolution (I returned to Petersburg, past German submarines, in a ship with lights out, wearing a life belt the whole time, just in time for October). This is the same as never having been in love and waking up one morning already married for ten years or so.\"\n1917\u20131931: Return to Russia.\nZamyatin's \"The Islanders\", satirizing English life, and the similarly themed \"A Fisher of Men\", were both published after his return to Russia.\nAccording to Mirra Ginsburg: \nIn 1917 he returned to Petersburg and plunged into the seething literary activity that was one of the most astonishing by-products of the revolution in ruined, ravaged, hungry, and epidemic-ridden Russia. He wrote stories, plays, and criticism; he lectured on literature and the writer's craft; he participated in various literary projects and committees \u2013 many of them initiated and presided over by Maxim Gorky \u2013 and served on various editorial boards, with Gorky, Blok, Korney Chukovsky, Gumilev, Shklovsky, and other leading writers, poets, critics, and linguists. And very soon he came under fire from the newly 'orthodox' \u2013 the Proletarian Writers who sought to impose on all art the sole criterion of 'usefulness to the revolution.'\nAs the Russian Civil War of 1917\u20131923 continued, Zamyatin's writings and statements became increasingly satirical and critical toward the Bolshevik party. Even though he was an Old Bolshevik and even though \"he accepted the revolution\", Zamyatin believed that independent speech and thought are necessary to any healthy society and opposed the Party's increasing suppression of freedom of speech and the censorship of literature, the media, and the arts.\nIn his 1918 essay \"Scythians?\" Zamyatin wrote: \nChrist on Golgotha, between two thieves, bleeding to death drop by drop, is the victor \u2013 because he has been crucified, because, in practical terms, he has been vanquished. But Christ victorious in practical terms is the Grand Inquisitor. And worse, Christ victorious in practical terms is a paunchy priest in a silk-lined purple robe, who dispenses benedictions with his right hand and collects donations with his left. The Fair Lady, in legal marriage, is simply Mrs. So-and-So, with hair curlers at night and a migraine in the morning. And Marx, having come down to earth, is simply a Krylenko. Such is the irony and such is the wisdom of fate. Wisdom because this ironic law holds the pledge of eternal movement forward. The realization, materialisation, practical victory of an idea immediately gives it a philistine hue. And the true Scythian will smell from a mile away the odor of dwellings, the odor of cabbage soup, the odor of the priest in his purple cassock, the odor of Krylenko \u2014 and will hasten away from the dwellings, into the steppe, to freedom.\"\nLater in the same essay, Zamyatin quoted a recent poem by Andrei Bely and used it to further criticize People's Commissar for Military Affairs Nikolai Krylenko and those like him for having, \"covered Russia with a pile of carcasses\" and for \"dreaming of socialist\u2013Napoleonic Wars in Europe \u2014 throughout the world, throughout the universe! But let us not jest incautiously. Bely is honest, and did not \"intend\" to speak about the Krylenkos.\"\nIn 1919, Zamyatin wrote, \"He who has found his ideal today is, like Lot's wife, already turned into a pillar of salt and does not move ahead. The world is kept alive only by heretics: the heretic Christ, the heretic Copernicus, the heretic Tolstoy. Our symbol of faith is heresy.\"\nZamyatin's novel \"We\", which he wrote between 1920 and 1921, is set many centuries in the future. D-503, a mathematician, lives in the One State, an urban society constructed almost entirely of glass apartment buildings, which assist mass surveillance by the secret police, the Bureau of Guardians. The structure of the One State is Panopticon-like, and life is scientifically managed based on the theories of F. W. Taylor. People march in step with each other and are uniformed. There is no way of referring to people except by numbers assigned by the One State. The society is run strictly by logic or reason as the primary justification for the laws or the construct of the society. The individual's behaviour is based on logic by way of formulas and equations outlined by the One State.\nAs the novel opens, the spaceship \"Integral\" is being built in order to visit extraterrestrial planets. In a deliberate swipe at the expansionist dreams of Nikolai Krylenko and others like him, the One State intends to \"force\" alien races \"to be happy\" by accepting the absolutism of the One State and its leader, the Benefactor. Meanwhile, as the spaceship's chief engineer, D-503 begins a journal that he intends to be carried upon the completed spaceship.\nLike all other citizens of One State, D-503 lives in a glass apartment building and is carefully watched by the Bureau of Guardians. D-503's lover, O-90, has been assigned by the One State to visit him on certain nights. She is considered too short to bear children and is deeply grieved by her state in life. O-90's other lover and D-503's best friend is R-13, a State poet who reads his verse at public executions.\nWhile on an assigned walk with O-90, D-503 meets a woman named I-330. I-330 smokes cigarettes, drinks vodka, and shamelessly flirts with D-503 instead of applying for a pink-ticket sex-visit; all of these acts are highly illegal according to the laws of One State.\nBoth repelled and fascinated, D-503 struggles to overcome his attraction to I-330. He begins dreaming, which people of the One State know to be a serious mental illness.\nSlowly, I-330 reveals to D-503 that she is in a member of MEPHI, an organization of rebels against the One State. I-330 also takes D-503 through secret tunnels to the untamed wilderness outside the Green Wall, which surrounds the city-state. There, D-503 meets human inhabitants whom the One State claims do not exist: hunter-gatherers whose bodies are covered with animal fur. MEPHI aims to topple the One State, destroy the Green Wall, and reunite the people of the city with the outside world.\nLike many other dystopian novels, \"We\" does not end happily for I-330 and D-503, it also ends with a general uprising by MEPHI and with the One State's survival in doubt. A recurring theme throughout \"We\" is that, just as there is no highest number, there can be no \"final\" revolution. Unsurprisingly, the Soviet Government refused to allow the publication of \"We\".\nIn his 1921 essay \"I Am Afraid\", Zamyatin began by criticizing the poets who unconditionally sang the praises of the new Soviet government. Zamyatin compared them with the Court Poets under the House of Romanov and under the French House of Bourbon. Zamyatin further criticized \"these nimble authors\" for knowing \"when to sing hail to the Tsar, and when to the Hammer and Sickle\". Zamyatin then wrote: \"True literature can exist only when it is created, not by diligent and reliable officials, but by madmen, hermits, heretics, dreamers, rebels and skeptics.\" Zamyatin continued by pointing out that writers in the new Soviet Union were forbidden to criticize and satirise, in the vein of Jonathan Swift and Anatole France, the foibles and failings of the new society. Zamyatin added that, while many compared Russia after the October Revolution to the Athenian democracy at its inception, the Athenian government and people did not fear the satirical stage-plays of Aristophanes, in which everyone was mocked and criticized. Zamyatin concluded by pointing out that if the Party did not rid itself of \"this new Catholicism, which is every bit as fearful of every heretical word as the old one\", then the only future possible for Russian literature was \"in the past.\"\nIn Zamyatin's 1923 essay \"The New Russian Prose\" he wrote: \"In art, the surest way to destroy is to canonize one given form and one philosophy: that which is canonized dies of obesity, of entropy.\" In his 1923 essay \"On Literature, Revolution, Entropy, and Other Matters\" Zamyatin wrote:\nThe law of revolution is red, fiery, deadly; but this death means the birth of a new life, a new star. And the law of entropy is cold, ice blue, like the icy interplanetary infinities. The flame turns from red to an even, warm pink, no longer deadly, but comfortable. The sun ages into a planet, convenient for highways, stores, beds, prostitutes, prisons; this is the law. And if the planet is to be kindled into youth again, it must be set on fire, it must be thrown off the smooth highway of evolution: this is the law. The flame will cool tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow (in the Book of Genesis days are equal to years, ages). But someone must see this already, and speak heretically today about tomorrow. Heretics are the only (bitter) remedy against the entropy of human thought. When the flaming, seething sphere (in science, religion, social life, art) cools, the fiery magma becomes coated with dogma \u2014 a rigid, ossified, motionless crust. Dogmatization in science, religion, social life, or art is the entropy of thought. What has become dogma no longer burns; it only gives off warmth \u2014 it is tepid, it is cool. Instead of the Sermon on the Mount, under the scorching sun, to upraised-arms and sobbing people, there is drowsy prayer in a magnificent abbey. Instead of Galileo's, 'Be still, it turns!' there are dispassionate computations in a well-heated room in an observatory. On the Galileos, the epigones build their own structures, slowly, bit by bit, like corals. This is the path of evolution \u2013 until a new heresy explodes the crush of dogma and all the edifices of the most enduring which have been raised upon it. Explosions are not very comfortable. And therefore the exploders, the heretics, are justly exterminated by fire, by axes, by words. To every today, to every civilization, to the laborious, slow, useful, most useful, creative, coral-building work, heretics are a threat. Stupidly, recklessly, they burst into today from tomorrow; they are romantics. Babeuf was justly beheaded in 1797; he leaped into 1797 across 150 years. It is just to chop off the head of a heretical literature which challenges dogma; this literature is harmful. But harmful literature is more useful than useful literature, for it is anti-entropic, it is a means of challenging calcification, sclerosis, crust, moss, quiescence. It is Utopian, absurd \u2013 like Babeuf in 1797. It is right 150 years later.\nZamyatin also wrote a number of short stories, in fairy tale form, that constituted satirical criticism of Communist ideology. According to Mirra Ginsburg: \nInstead of idealized eulogies to the Revolution, Zamyatin wrote stories like \"The Dragon\", \"The Cave\", and \"A Story about the Most Important Thing\", reflecting the starkness and the territory of the time: the little man lost in his uniform, transformed into a dragon with a gun; the starving, frozen intellectual reduced to stealing a few logs of wood; the city turned into a barren, prehistoric landscape \u2013 a desert of caves and cliffs and roaring mammoths; fratricide and destruction and blood. In \"The Church of God\", he questions the Bolshevik tenet that the end justifies the means. In \"The Flood\", he gives the central place to individual passions against a background that reflects the vast changes of the time as marginally and obliquely as they are reflected in the consciousness of his characters \u2013 residents of an outlying suburb, whose knowledge of the history around them is limited to such facts as the deteriorating quality of coal, the silent machines, the lack of bread.\"\nIn 1923, Zamyatin arranged for the manuscript of his dystopian science-fiction novel \"We\" to be smuggled to E.P. Dutton and Company in New York City. After being translated into English by Russian refugee Gregory Zilboorg, the novel was published in 1924. Then, in 1927, Zamyatin went much further. He smuggled the original Russian text to Marc Lvovich Slonim (1894\u20131976), the editor of an anti-communist Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 magazine and publishing house based in Prague. To the fury of the Soviet State, copies of the Czechoslovak edition began being smuggled back to the Soviet Union and secretly passed from hand to hand. Zamyatin's secret dealings with Western publishers triggered a mass offensive by the Soviet State against him.\nThese attitudes, writings, and actions, which the Party considered Deviationism made Zamyatin's position increasingly difficult as the 1920s wore on. Zamyatin became, according to Mirra Ginsburg, one of \"the first to become the target of concerted hounding by the Party critics and writers.\" According to Ginsburg: \nZamyatin's vision was too far-reaching, too nonconformist, and too openly expressed to be tolerated by the purveyors of official and compulsory dogma. Very early he was branded by Trotsky as an internal \u00e9migr\u00e9. He was repeatedly attacked as a bourgeois intellectual, out of tune with the revolution. When the Party-line Russian Association of Proletarian Writers (RAPP) gained full sway in the latter 1920s, with the end of the New Economic Policy and the introduction of the first Five Year Plan, it set out systematically to end all originality and independence in the arts. Art had to serve the ends of the Party or it had no right to exist.\"\nMax Eastman, an American Communist who had similarly broken with his former beliefs, described the Politburo's war against Zamyatin in his 1934 book \"Artists in Uniform\".\nAccording to Mirra Ginsburg: \nAll the instruments of power were brought into use in the campaign for conformity. Faced with grim alternatives, most of Zamyatin's erstwhile pupils and colleagues yielded to pressure, recanted publicly, in many cases rewrote their works, and devoted themselves to turning out the gray eulogies to Communist construction demanded by the dictatorship. Other writers, like Babel and Olesha, chose silence. Many committed suicide. Zamyatin's destruction took a different form. One of the most active and influential figures in the All-Russian Writers' Union, which included a variety of literary schools, he became the object of a frenzied campaign of vilification. He was dismissed from his editorial posts; magazines and publishing houses closed their doors to him; those which ventured to publish his work were persecuted; his plays were withdrawn from the stage. Under the pressure of the Party inquisitors, his friends began to be afraid to see him and many of his comrades in the Writer's Union denounced him. He was, in effect, presented with the choice of repudiating his work and his views, or total expulsion from literature.\nInstead of surrendering, Zamyatin, whom Mirra Ginsburg has dubbed \"a man of incorruptible and uncompromising courage,\" on 24 September 1929, wrote and mailed a letter resigning his membership in the Union of Soviet Writers. Ginsburg states Zamyatin wrote in his resignation letter \"that it was impossible for him to remain in a literary organization which, even indirectly, took part in the persecution of its members.\" In 1931, he appealed directly to Soviet General Secretary Joseph Stalin, requesting permission to leave the Soviet Union. In this letter Zamyatin wrote: \"I do not wish to conceal that the basic reason for my request for permission to go abroad with my wife is my hopeless position here as a writer, the death sentence that has been pronounced upon me as a writer here at home.\"\nDuring the spring of 1931, Zamyatin asked Maxim Gorky, to intercede with Stalin on his behalf.\nAfter Gorky's death in 1936, Zamyatin wrote: \nOne day, Gorky's secretary telephoned to say that Gorky wished me to have dinner with him at his country home. I remember clearly that extraordinarily hot day and the rainstorm \u2014 a tropical downpour \u2014 in Moscow. Gorky's car sped through a wall of water, bringing me and several other invited guests to dinner at his home. It was a literary dinner, and close to twenty people sat around the table. At first Gorky was silent, visibly tired. Everybody drank wine, but his glass contained water \u2013 he was not allowed to drink wine. After a while, he rebelled, poured himself a glass of wine, then another and another, and became the old Gorky. The storm ended, and I walked out onto the large stone terrace. Gorky followed me immediately and said to me, 'The affair of your passport is settled. But if you wish, you can return the passport and stay.' I said I would go. Gorky frowned and went back to the other guests in the dining room. It was late. Some of the guests remained overnight; others, including myself, were returning to Moscow. In parting, Gorky said, 'When shall we meet again? If not in Moscow, then perhaps in Italy? If I go there, you must come to see me! In any case, until we meet again, eh?' This was the last time I saw Gorky.\nZamyatin left the Soviet Union in November 1931.\nLife in exile.\nAfter their emigration, Zamyatin and his wife settled in Paris. According to Mirra Ginsburg: \"Zamyatin's last years in Paris were years of great material hardship and loneliness. As Remizov wrote, 'He came with sealed lips and a sealed heart.' He found little in common with most of the emigr\u00e9s who had left Russia a decade earlier.\"\nThe screenplay for Jean Renoir's \"The Lower Depths\" (1936), from Maxim Gorky's stage play of the same name, was co-written by Zamyatin.\nZamyatin later wrote: \"Gorky was informed of this, and wrote that he was pleased at my participation in the project, that he would like to see the adaptation of his play, and would wait to receive the manuscript. The manuscript was never sent: by the time it was ready for mailing, Gorky was dead.\" After the film premiered, Zamyatin wrote articles for French magazines and worked on a novel, \"The Scourge of God\", which has Attila as the main character. The novel was never finished.\nDeath and burial.\nYevgeny Zamyatin died in poverty of a heart attack on 10 March 1937. Only a small group of friends were present for his burial at the Cimeti\u00e8re de Thiais, in the Parisian suburb of the same name.\nOne of the mourners, however, was Zamyatin's Russian language publisher Marc Lvovich Slonim, who had befriended the Zamyatins after their arrival in the West. His death was unreported in the Soviet press.\nLegacy.\nWriting in 1967, Mirra Ginsburg commented: \"Like Bulgakov and like Babel, Zamyatin gives us a glimpse of what post-revolutionary Russian literature might have become had independence, daring, and individuality not been stamped out so ruthlessly by the dictatorship. The Russian reader \u2013 and by the same token, the Russian writer \u2013 was deprived of the work of these rich and germinal writers, and the effects, alas, are sadly evident.\"\nThe Communist Party of the Soviet Union's vengeance, however, against Zamyatin for sending his novel \"We\" to the West for publication was remembered by Soviet poets and writers long after the writer's death. This is why it was 1957 before another Soviet writer took the risk of doing so again. In that year, when he handed the manuscript to his novel \"Doctor Zhivago\" over to an emissary from billionaire Italian publisher Giangiacomo Feltrinelli, Boris Pasternak said: \"You are hereby invited to watch me face the firing squad.\"\nEven though Pasternak was accordingly subjected to State-organized character assassination, ostracism, and blacklisting almost identical to what had been experienced by Zamyatin, Pasternak's decision to publish \"Doctor Zhivago\" in the West also helped him to win the 1958 Nobel Prize for Literature.\nNot surprisingly, many other Soviet dissidents after Pasternak would also go on to both use and expand upon the ideas and tactics pioneered by the author of \"We\". For example, Alexander Solzhenitsyn was Christianizing Zamyatin's attacks against State-enforced conformity when he wrote, in his 1973 \"Letter to Soviet Leaders\": \"Our present system is unique in world history, because over and above its physical and economic constraints, it demands of us total surrender of our souls, continuous and willing participation in the general, conscious \"lie\". To this putrefaction of the soul, this spiritual enslavement, human beings who wish to be human cannot submit. When Caesar, having exacted what is Caesar's, demands still more insistently that we render unto him what is God's \u2013 that is a sacrifice we dare not make.\"\nIn the same year, Solzhenitsyn responded to the KGB's seizure of a hidden manuscript of \"The Gulag Archipelago\", his nonfiction expos\u00e9 of the Soviet secret police, the Soviet concentration camps, and the role of Vladimir Lenin in setting up both, by ordering his publisher in France to publish the whole book immediately. This resulted, as with Zamyatin, in Solzhenitsyn's departure from his homeland.\nAs part of last Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev's reformist policies of glasnost and perestroika, Zamyatin's writing began to again be published legally in his homeland in 1988.\nEven since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Zamyatin's many denunciations of enforced conformity and groupthink, as well as his belief that writers and intellectuals have a duty to oppose the calcification and entropy of human thought has meant that his writings continue to have both readers and admirers.\nScience fiction.\n\"We\" has often been discussed as a political satire aimed at the police state of the Soviet Union. There are many other dimensions, however. It may variously be examined as \nGeorge Orwell believed that Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\" (1932) must be partly derived from \"We\". However, in a 1962 letter to Christopher Collins, Huxley says that he wrote \"Brave New World\" as a reaction to H.G. Wells's utopias long before he had heard of \"We\". Kurt Vonnegut said that in writing \"Player Piano\" (1952) he \"cheerfully ripped off the plot of \"Brave New World\", whose plot had been cheerfully ripped off from Yevgeny Zamyatin's \"We\".\"\n\"We\" directly inspired:\nIn 1994, \"We\" received a Prometheus Award in the Libertarian Futurist Society's \"Hall of Fame\" category.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography\n\"We\" was first published in the Soviet Union in this collection of Zamyatin's works."}
{"id": "34382", "revid": "4637213", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34382", "title": "Yom Kippur", "text": "Holiest day in Judaism\nYom Kippur ( ; , lit.\u2009'Day of Atonement') is the holiest day of the year in Judaism. It occurs annually on the 10th of Tishrei, corresponding to a date in late September or early October.\nFor traditional Jewish people, it is primarily centered on atonement and repentance. The day's main observances consist of full fasting and asceticism, both accompanied by extended prayer services (usually at synagogue) and sin confessions. Some minor Jewish denominations, such as Reconstructionist Judaism, focus less on sins and more on one's goals and accomplishments and setting yearly intentions.\nAlongside the related holiday of Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur is one of the two components of the High Holy Days of Judaism. It is also the last of the Ten Days of Repentance.\nName.\nThe formal Hebrew name of the holiday is , 'day [of] the atonements'. This name is used in the Bible, Mishnah, and Shulchan Aruch. The word 'atonement' is one of many Biblical Hebrew words which, while using a grammatical plural form, refers to a singular abstract concept.\nBeginning in the classical period, the singular form began to be used in piyyut, for example in Unetanneh Tokef, alongside the standard plural form . Use of spread in the medieval period, with () becoming the holiday's name in Yiddish and () in Ladino. In modern Hebrew, or simply is the common name, while () is used in formal writing.\nIn older English texts, the translation \"Day of Atonement\" is often used.\nIn the Torah.\nThe Torah calls the day (), and decrees fasting (\"affliction of the soul\") and a strict prohibition of work on the tenth day of the seventh month, later known as Tishrei. The laws of Yom Kippur are commanded by God to Moses in three passages in the Torah:\nYom Kippur is mentioned briefly in another context: on Yom Kippur of the Jubilee year the shofar was to be blown. According to some, this is the source for the current custom of blowing the shofar at the conclusion of Yom Kippur.\nTemple service.\nWhen the Temple in Jerusalem stood, Yom Kippur was the occasion of an elaborate sacrificial service, as commanded by . The most prominent portion of the service was the lottery drawn on two goats with one being sacrificed as an offering and one being thrown off a cliff. This is the origin for the term scapegoat. The rabbis summarized the laws of this service in Mishnah tractate Yoma, and they appear in contemporary traditional Jewish prayer books for Yom Kippur, and are studied as part of a traditional Jewish Yom Kippur worship service. The Mussaf prayer on Yom Kippur includes a section known as the Avodah, where a poem is recited describing this Temple service.\nSignificance.\nHigh Holy Days.\nYom Kippur is one of the two High Holy Days, or \"Days of Awe\" (Hebrew ), alongside Rosh Hashanah (which falls nine days previously). According to Jewish tradition, on Rosh Hashanah God inscribes each person's fate for the coming year into the Book of Life, and waits until Yom Kippur to \"seal\" the verdict. This process is described dramatically in the poem Unetanneh Tokef, which is recited on Rosh Hashanah in the Ashkenazic and Italian rites and on Yom Kippur in the Eastern Ashkenazic and Italian rites:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A great shofar will be blown, and a small still voice will be heard. The angels will make haste, and be seized with fear and trembling, and will say: \"Behold, the day of judgment!\"... On Rosh Hashanah it is written, and on the Yom Kippur fast it is sealed, how many will pass and how many will be created, who will live and who will die, who in his time and who not in his time... But repentance [\"teshuva\"], prayer, and charity [\"tzedakah\"] remove the evil of the decree... For You do not desire a person's death, but rather that he repent and live. Until the day of his death You wait for him; if he repents, You accept him immediately.\nDuring the Days of Awe, a Jew reflects on the past year's actions and seeks forgiveness for wrongs done against both God and other people.\nRepentance (\"\").\nRepentance in Judaism (Hebrew: ), traditionally, consists of regretting having committed the sin, resolving not to commit that sin in the future, and confessing that sin before God.\nWhile repentance for one's sins can and should be done at any time, it is considered especially desirable during the Ten Days of Repentance between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, and particularly on Yom Kippur itself. Thus, the Yom Kippur prayers contain extended confessions which list varieties of errors and sins, and to which one can add their own missteps, along with requests for forgiveness from God.\nAccording to the Talmud, \"Yom Kippur atones for sins done against God (), but does not atone for sins done against other human beings () until the other person has been appeased.\" Therefore, it is considered imperative to repair the harm that one has done to others before or during Yom Kippur. Yom Kippur is described in the prayers as \"a day of creating love and brotherhood, a day of abandoning jealousy and strife\". It is said that \"if one does not remove hatred [from their heart] on Yom Kippur, their prayers are not heard\".\nIn recent generations other interpretations of \"Teshuvah\" have been presented. They argue that the traditional, self-punishing practice of dwelling on and weeping over past sins often leads to depression and is counterproductive in the modern era.\nInstead of \"repentance\" (focusing on guilt and remorse over mistakes), they interpret \"Teshuvah\" in a more literal sense: \"return\" to God. This involves proactively filling one's life with Torah, Mitzvot, joy, love, and sincere prayer to G-d. When an individual is wholeheartedly focused on growing closer to the Divine light, the regrettable behaviors of ones past are then naturally recognized as a useless weight holding them back. This recognition triggers a genuine, aching remorse that causes the sin to fall away enabling the person to let go and continue growing. Thus, Yom Kippur should be used to reach towards the light and embrace God's unconditional love, allowing the messy stuff to fall away naturally.\nThirteen attributes.\nAccording to the Bible, after the sin of the golden calf, Moses descended from Mount Sinai and broke the Tablets of Stone, which contained the Ten Commandments and symbolized the covenant with God. After God agreed to forgive the people's sin, Moses was told to return to Mount Sinai for a second 40-day period, in order to receive a second set of tablets. According to rabbinic tradition, the date Moses descended with the second set of tablets was Yom Kippur. On this day Moses announced to the people that they had been forgiven; as a result the Torah fixed this date as a permanent holiday of forgiveness.\nThe new covenant, which God announced by proclaiming the Thirteen Attributes of Mercy to Moses, is textually similar to the covenant of the Ten Commandments except that God's nature is described as merciful and forgiving, rather than zealous. When the Jewish people sinned in later eras, prophets would repeatedly quote the Thirteen Attributes to God as a reminder of God's commitment to mercy and forgiveness. This is continued to the present day, as recitation of the Thirteen Attributes remains an important part of the Yom Kippur prayers (in Maariv and Neilah).\nCloseness to God.\nWhile many of the observances of Yom Kippur (such as fasting and long prayers) can be difficult, there is also a tradition in which they are interpreted positively, as indications of closeness of God. Various sources compare the observances of Yom Kippur \u2013 fasting, barefootness (not wearing leather shoes), standing (in prayer), particular manners of prayer, even the peace that exists between Jews on this day \u2013 with the behavior of angels, suggesting that on Yom Kippur Jews become like angels in heaven, purified and close to God and not limited by physicality.\nYom Kippur was also unique as a time of closeness to God in the Yom Kippur Temple service. Yom Kippur was the only occasion on which the High Priest of Israel was allowed to enter the Holy of Holies, the innermost chamber of the Temple in Jerusalem, where God's presence was said to dwell. On Yom Kippur the High Priest entered the Holy of Holies several times, first to create a cloud of incense smoke in which (the Bible promises) God would reveal Himself without being seen, and later to offer sacrifices of atonement.\nWhile the encounter with God and the atonement may appear to be unrelated, in fact they are mutually dependent. On one hand, the priest is only worthy to approach God when in a state of purity, with the sins of the people being forgiven. On the other hand, only by approaching God with an intimate, personal request can God be persuaded to abandon justice for mercy, permitting the purification to take place.\nAccording to the Torah, the Yom Kippur Temple service was commanded in wake of the deaths of Nadab and Abihu on the eighth day of the Tabernacle inauguration. Not only was this eighth day the occasion of the Yom Kippur command, but the eighth day was also similar in its nature to Yom Kippur, both in biblical texts (e.g. the sacrifices offered on each day) and in rabbinic interpretation. The purpose of the eighth day was the revelation of God's presence to the people; similarly, the Yom Kippur service was a unique opportunity for the people's representative to obtain closeness with God.\nA midrash compares the Yom Kippur prayers to a verse from the Song of Songs, describing a woman who rises from bed at night to begin a romantic encounter with her lover. With each Yom Kippur prayer, it is implied, Jews approach closer to God:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"I rose up to open to my beloved. My hands dripped with myrrh, my fingers with flowing myrrh, upon the handles of the bolt\" () \u2013 \"I rose up to open to my beloved\" \u2013 this refers to \"Yotzer\" [the morning prayer]; \"My hands dripped with myrrh\" \u2013 this refers to Mussaf; \"my fingers with flowing myrrh\" \u2013 this refers to Mincha; \"upon the handles of the bolt\" \u2013 this refers to Neilah.\nUsing a similar metaphor, the Mishnah describes Yom Kippur as a wedding date, as on this date Moses returned having reestablished the covenant between God and Israel. Along with Tu B'Av, Yom Kippur was historically considered one of the two happiest days of the Jewish year, for on this day Jews receive forgiveness for their sins, and on this date the covenant with God was reestablished.\nAccording to Hassidic thought Yom Kippur is related to the deepest level of the human soul. The soul is described as having five different levels, the fifth and most essential of which is called Yechidah, meaning \"one and unique\". This yechidah is the soul in its state of complete fusion and oneness with its Creator, forming an inseparable whole.\nYom Kippur is the day when this essential bond of yechidah shines within the time and space of our world. It is the one time a year when the Divine unites with the essential oneness of the soul within each person, and in that moment of ultimate connection, all else falls away.\nPurification.\nIn , the Torah summarizes the purpose of Yom Kippur as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThere are two forms of impurity in Judaism (see Tumah and taharah): ritual impurity (e.g. when one touches a corpse) and moral impurity (when one commits a serious sin). While the Yom Kippur Temple service did purify the Temple if it had become ritually impure, the emphasis of the day is on the Jewish people's purification from moral impurity.\nLeviticus 16:30 mentions purification twice. According to Netziv, the first mention is a promise that God will purify Israel on this day, while the second is a command, calling on Israel to purify themselves through repentance. Thus, on this day Jews do their utmost to repent. But if, by the end of the day, they have reached the limits of their ability and are still morally flawed, God extends them forgiveness and purification anyway.\n states that \"Israel's hope () is in God\". According to Rabbi Akiva, this verse alludes to a ritual purification bath (also pronounced \"mikveh\"), and thus on Yom Kippur God metaphorically becomes a mikveh in which Israel immerses and purifies itself. This idea is symbolized by immersion in an actual mikveh. In the Yom Kippur Temple service, the High Priest would immerse upon putting on and taking off his white Yom Kippur garments; the rabbis counted no fewer than five immersions over the course of the day's service. Among modern-day Jews, too, there is a custom of immersion before Yom Kippur (though not on Yom Kippur itself, as bathing is forbidden in normal circumstances).\nWhen the scapegoat was selected on Yom Kippur to symbolically carry the people's sins to the desert, a crimson cord was tied around its horns. While the practical purpose of this cord was to distinguish the scapegoat from the goat which was to be slaughtered, it also symbolized the sin which the scapegoat was carrying away. promises that if the Jewish people repents, \"if [their] sins are like crimson, they shall become white as snow.\" According to tradition, in some years the scapegoat's cord would miraculously turn white to indicate that the people's sins were forgiven and purification achieved in that year.\nJewish unity.\nYom Kippur is considered a day of Jewish unity. In Kol Nidre, in which vows are released, vows of excommunication against sinning Jews were similarly lifted and these \"transgressors\" were allowed to pray alongside other Jews. According to the Talmud, \"Any fast in which Jewish sinners do not also participate is not a valid fast\".\nSimilarly, the Mishnah describes Yom Kippur as a day on which men and women would once meet each other in the vineyards in order to arrange marriages. While this story is surprising given the generally somber nature of the day, it is based on the Biblical episode where the oath against marrying Benjaminites was circumvented by allowing them to take women from the vineyards as wives, and thus indicates the day's theme of abandoning grudges in order for the Jewish people to be reunited.\nCustoms.\nErev Yom Kippur.\nOn the day preceding Yom Kippur, known as (lit. 'eve [of] day [of] atonement'), a number of activities are customarily performed in preparation for Yom Kippur. These activities generally relate to the themes of the holiday, but are forbidden or impractical to do on Yom Kippur itself.\nAccording to the Talmud, \"Yom Kippur does not atone for sins between a person and his fellow until he has appeased his fellow.\" Thus, it is common practice on Erev Yom Kippur to request forgiveness from other individuals for misdeeds one has done to them. The Talmud records no less than 14 stories attesting to the importance of the day for repairing relationships with one's spouses, parents, children, coworkers, the poor, and other individuals. The day before a major Jewish holiday is often devoted towards preparing for that holiday (as with burning \"chametz\" before Passover or obtaining the Four Species before Sukkot); for Yom Kippur, the appropriate preparation is to seek forgiveness from one's fellow man. Nevertheless, one should not ask forgiveness if this will cause further harm (for example, by bringing up an insult the victim was unaware of).\nAccording to \"halakha\", one must eat on Erev Yom Kippur. A variety of reasons have been suggested for this requirement, among them:\nKreplach are traditionally served at the pre-fast meal. Also, it is common to ask for and receive lekach on Erev Yom Kippur.\nMany Orthodox men immerse themselves in a \"mikveh\" on this day. Opinions differ on whether this is a technical act to remove ritual impurity, or else a symbolic one to symbolize one's cleansing from sin on Yom Kippur.\nThe \"kapparot\" ritual, in which either money or a chicken is given to charity, is performed by some on Erev Yom Kippur as a means to enhance atonement.\nPrior to this day's morning prayer service (Shacharit), \"selichot\" prayers are recited, as they have been for the entire High Holiday period. In the afternoon prayer (Mincha), the long confession is recited, just as it is on Yom Kippur itself. This confession is recited before the last Erev Yom Kippur meal (the \"Separation Meal\" \u2013 Hebrew \"se'udah\" \"hamafseket\" or \"aruha hamafseket\"), in case one becomes intoxicated at this meal and is unable to confess properly afterwards, or else because a person might choke to death at that meal and die without confessing (seemingly an unlikely possibility, but one which reminds a person of their mortality). Nevertheless, some recommend repeating the Vidui immediately before Kol Nidrei if time allows.\nFasting and asceticism.\nThe Torah commands Jews to \"afflict themselves\" () on Yom Kippur. While these verses do not explicitly mention the form of affliction, the phrase \"afflicting oneself\" frequently appears elsewhere in connection with fasting or lack of food, and public fast days for repentance were a common practice in Biblical times. According to the Jewish oral tradition, the Yom Kippur \"affliction\" consists of the following five prohibitions:\nIn traditional custom, the fast is required of males over age 13 and females over age 12. However, fasting is waived in the case of dangerous medical conditions (pikuach nefesh), and in such a case one is actually required to break the fast. Just as it is a mitzvah to fast on Yom Kippur, it may also be a mitzvah to eat or drink on Yom Kippur to safeguard a person's health. In such situations, though, it is preferable (if the medical situation allows for it) to consume only small amounts of food or drink at a time.\nFasting, along with the other restrictions, begins at sundown, and ends after nightfall the following day. One should add a few minutes to the beginning and end of the day, called , lit. 'addition to Yom Kippur'.\nYom Kippur is one of the only occasions when fasting is permitted on Shabbat.\nSymbolism.\nA number of different interpretations of these restrictions have been suggested.\nIn one approach, fasting replaces animal sacrifices. Fasting causes one's fat and blood to be diminished, just as the fat and blood of a sacrifice were burned on the altar. Thus, the fast is a form of sacrifice which can atone for sin like the Temple sacrifices once did.\nOther approaches suggest that the prohibitions represent not suffering, but rather special holiness. For example, on Yom Kippur, Jews are said to become like angels. Just as angels do not need to eat, drink, or wear shoes, so too Jews do not engage on these activities on Yom Kippur. By detaching themselves from physical needs, Jews become purified and resemble angels.\nSimilarly, the prohibitions allude to the experience of Moses on Mount Sinai, who did not eat or drink while receiving the Torah and while receiving forgiveness for the people's sins.\nSimilarly, the prohibitions have been interpreted as a return to the purity of the biblical Garden of Eden. Upon leaving Eden shoes became necessary for the first time (\"thorns and thistles will grow in your way...the snake will raise its head (to bite you) and you will give your heel (to crush it)\"); thus on Yom Kippur Jews do not wear (leather) shoes. While in Eden food and drink were easily obtained, but after the expulsion man must work for food \"by the sweat of [his] brow\"; thus food and drink are refrained from on Yom Kippur, as well as washing, and the use of cosmetics to remove sweat or its odor. In Eden death was unknown and procreation unnecessary; similarly on Yom Kippur marital relations are avoided.\nAccording to Maimonides, the purpose of fasting (and the restriction on work) is to remove distractions from the task of repentance.\nBy refraining from these activities, the body is uncomfortable but can still survive. The soul is considered to be the life force in a body. Therefore, by making one's body uncomfortable, one's soul is uncomfortable. By feeling pain, one can feel how others feel when they are in pain.\nProhibition on work.\nThe Torah calls Yom Kippur a day of rest () on which work is prohibited. Thus, the activities forbidden on Shabbat are also forbidden on Yom Kippur: the 39 categories of work as well as the rabbinic Shabbat prohibitions.\nOther observances.\nWearing white clothing is traditional to symbolize one's purity on this day. Various reasons have been suggested for this custom:\nMany Ashkenazi Jewish men wear a kittel which, in addition to being white, symbolizes the seriousness of God's judgment on this day, as in some communities the deceased are buried wearing kittels.\nYom Kippur is honored in the same ways as Shabbat and other holidays, to the extent permitted. Thus, the house is cleaned ahead of time, and the table covered with a nice tablecloth, even though it will not be used for eating. The synagogue is cleaned ahead of time, and all the lights left on. One bathes before Yom Kippur, and clean clothes are worn. Smelling pleasant smells is allowed on Yom Kippur, therefore many make a point of smelling pleasant spices throughout the day.\nIn most communities, candles are lit just before Yom Kippur, as is done before Shabbat. However, there were communities which had the custom not to light candles when Yom Kippur falls on a weekday (when it falls on Shabbat, everyone agrees that there is an obligation to light just like any other Sabbath), and therefore the Halakhic authorities debate whether or not a blessing is recited on this lighting.\nIt is traditional for parents to give their children a special blessing before beginning the Yom Kippur prayers. Those whose parents have died light a yahrzeit candle in their memory before Yom Kippur begins.\nBreaking of the fast.\nFollowing the fast, Sephardic Jewish communities traditionally serve a drink made from melon seeds similar to the Turkish \"s\u00fcbye\". Turkish Jews refer to it as \"subiye\", while Greek Jews call it \"pepitada\". This is followed by coffee with milk and \"biscochos\" (savory ring-shaped cookies), pieces of bread dipped in olive oil and \"za'atar\" alongside tomato, and later, chicken cooked with dry quinces or plums.\nPrayer services.\nThe Yom Kippur prayer service includes several unique aspects. One is the number of prayer services. Unlike a regular day which has three prayer services (Shacharit, Mincha, and Maariv), or a Shabbat or Yom Tov which has four prayer services (those three, plus Mussaf), Yom Kippur has five prayer services (those four, plus \"Ne'ila\", the closing prayer). The prayer services also include private and public confessions of sins (\"Vidui\"), and a unique prayer dedicated to the special Yom Kippur (service) of the Kohen Gadol (high priest) in the Holy Temple in Jerusalem. The Yom Kippur prayer services include additional poems (\"piyyutim\") and petitions for forgiveness (\"selichot\"). Notable poems recited include Avinu Malkeinu, Unetanneh Tokef (in Eastern Ashkenazic and Italian communities), Ki Anu Amecha (in Ashkenazic communities, although the order of the verses varies between communities), the Ten Martyrs (in Eastern Ashkenazic and some Western Ashkenazic communities), HaAderet v'HaEmunah, and Mareh Kohen (both in Ashkenazic communities). If Yom Kippur falls on Shabbat, Avinu Malkeinu is recited by Ashkenazic only during the Ne'ila prayer service, whereas the Sephardic and Italian rite recite it as normal at Shacharit and Mincha.\nMany married Ashkenazi Orthodox men wear a \"kittel\", a white robe-like garment for evening prayers on Yom Kippur, also used in Eastern European communities by men on their wedding day. They also wear a tallit (prayer shawl), which is typically worn only during morning services.\nOrder of prayers.\nBefore the beginning of Yom Kippur, many Jews recite the optional ('the pure prayer'), in which (among other topics) one declares that they forgive anyone who has harmed them in the past, \"except for damages which can be recovered in court, and except for those who say: I will harm him and he will forgive me\", asks God not to punish anyone who has been so forgiven, and asks God to show similar graciousness in forgiving their own sins.\nLike all Jewish holidays, Yom Kippur begins in the evening, and the evening prayer () is preceded by the special Kol Nidre (described below) prayer.\nThe next morning, the morning prayer () is recited. The Torah reading is from , describing the Yom Kippur Temple service and the laws of the day. The Yom Kippur Torah reading is divided into six portions, and seven on the Sabbath. The Haftarah is from , according to which God will ignore the prayers of one who fasts while continuing to perform evil deeds. In most communities, Yizkor is then recited.\nNext is the added prayer () as on all other holidays. The highlight of this prayer is the Avodah recitation, where the prayer leader recounts the Yom Kippur Temple service by which the High Priest would once obtain atonement from God in the Temple in Jerusalem. Other notable additions to Yom Kippur Mussaf in the Eastern Ashkenazic rite include the Unetanneh Tokef and Ten Martyrs poems.\nWhile the original custom was for the Yom Kippur prayer service to take the entire day with no break, in recent years some have instituted a short break after Mussaf before the next prayers, which last until the conclusion of the fast.\nNext is the afternoon prayer () and a Torah reading. The Haftarah that follows is the entire Book of Jonah, which has as its theme the story of God's willingness to forgive those who repent. The service concludes with the \"Ne'ila\" (\"closing\") prayer, which begins shortly before sunset, when the \"gates of prayer\" will be closed. After Ne'ila, Yom Kippur comes to an end with a recitation of \"Shema Yisrael\" and the blowing of the \"shofar\", which marks the conclusion of the fast and symbolizes freedom from sin. Finally, the brief weekday Maariv prayer is recited, before the recitation of Havdalah.\nKol Nidre.\nBefore sunset on Yom Kippur eve, worshipers gather in the synagogue. The cantor stands with two community members at his sides, and chants the Kol Nidre prayer (Aramaic: \u05db\u05dc \u05e0\u05d3\u05e8\u05d9, English translation: 'All vows'). It is recited in a dramatic manner, before the open ark, with an Ashkenazic melody that dates back to the 16th century. Kol Nidre is recited in Aramaic, except in the Italian and Romaniote rites where it is recited in Hebrew.\nAll personal vows we are likely to make, all personal oaths and pledges we are likely to take between this Yom Kippur and the next Yom Kippur (in some versions: which we took between last Yom Kippur and this Yom Kippur), we publicly renounce. Let them all be relinquished and abandoned, null and void, neither firm nor established. Let our personal vows, pledges and oaths be considered neither vows nor pledges nor oaths.\nThen the service continues with the evening prayers () and an extended Selichot service.\nAvodah.\nThe ('service') passage in the Musaf prayer recounts in detail the Yom Kippur Temple service which was once performed in the Temple in Jerusalem. This passage traditionally features prominently in both the liturgy and the religious thought of the holiday. During its recitation, Jews \"imagine themselves in place of the priests when the Temple stood\".\nThis traditional prominence is rooted in the Babylonian Talmud's description of how to attain atonement following the destruction of the Temple in tractate Yoma. The recitation poetically describes the High Priest's confessions of his and the people's sins, his entry into the Holy of Holies, his sending away of the scapegoat, and all other parts of this day's complex Temple service. A variety of liturgical poems are added, including a poem recounting the radiance of the High Priest after exiting the Holy of Holies, as well as prayers for the speedy rebuilding of the Temple and the restoration of sacrificial worship.\nIn most Orthodox and some Conservative synagogues, the entire congregation prostrates themselves at each point in the recitation where the High Priest would pronounce God's holiest name (during recitation of \n). These three times, plus in some congregations the \"Aleinu\" prayer during the Musaf Amidah on Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah, are the only times in Jewish services when Jews engage in prostration (except for some Yemenite Jews and ('disciples of Maimonides') who may prostrate themselves on other occasions during the year).\nOrthodox liturgies include prayers lamenting the inability to perform the Temple service and petitioning for its restoration, which Conservative synagogues generally omit. In some Conservative synagogues, only the \"Hazzan\" (cantor) engages in full prostration. Some Conservative synagogues abridge the recitation of the Avodah service to varying degrees, and some omit it entirely. Reconstructionist services omit the entire service as inconsistent with modern sensibilities.\nConfession.\nAs confession is a core aspect of repentance, confession (or ) is a major part of the Yom Kippur prayer services. A confession is recited ten times on Yom Kippur, twice in each of the five standard prayers. In each prayer service, the confession is recited once by the individual in their silent prayer, and again communally during the cantor's repetition of the Amidah. (The prayer has no repetition, so the second confession is instead recited in the communal Selichot recitation which follows the silent prayer.) Confession is recited an 11th time by individuals in the Mincha prayer of Yom Kippur eve, before the beginning of the holiday, and in some communities this is repeated by the Chazzan.\nThe Yom Kippur confession text consists of two parts: a short confession beginning with the word (, 'we have sinned'), which is a series of words describing sin arranged according to the (Hebrew alphabetic order), and a long confession, beginning with the words (, 'for the sin'), which is a set of 22 acrostics, in some communities double acrostics, also arranged according to the , enumerating a range of sins. Al Cheyt is omitted in both recitations of the confession in Neilah.\nIn Reform Judaism.\nReform synagogues generally experience their largest attendance of the year on Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah for worship services. The prayer philosophy of Reform, as described in the introduction of the movement's High Holy Day prayerbook, \"Mishkan HaNefesh\", is to reflect \"varied theological approaches that enable a diverse congregation to share religious experience... with a commitment to Reform tradition, as well as [to] the larger Jewish tradition.\" A central feature of these Reform services is the rabbinic sermon. \"For more than a century and a half in the Reform Movement,\" writes Rabbi Lance Sussman, \"High Holiday sermons were among the most anticipated events in synagogue life, especially on the eve of Rosh Hashanah and Kol Nidre night.\"\nObservance.\nAs one of the most culturally significant Jewish holidays, Yom Kippur is observed by many secular Jews who may not observe other holidays. Many secular Jews attend synagogue on Yom Kippur \u2013 for many secular Jews the High Holy Days are the only times of the year during which they attend synagogue \u2013 causing synagogue attendance to soar.\nObservance in Israel.\nYom Kippur is a legal holiday in Israel. There are no radio or television broadcasts, airports are shut down, there is no public transportation, and all shops and businesses are closed.\nIn 2019, 60.5% of the Jewish people of Israel said that they were intending to fast on Yom Kippur. It is very common in Israel to wish \"Tsom Kal\" ([an] easy fast) or ([a] benefiting fast) to everyone before Yom Kippur, even if one does not know whether they will fast or not.\nIt is considered impolite to eat in public on Yom Kippur or to play music or to drive a motor vehicle. There is no legal prohibition on any of these, but in practice such actions are almost universally avoided in Israel during Yom Kippur, except for emergency services.\nOver the last few decades, bicycle-riding and inline skating on the empty streets have become common among secular Israeli youths, especially on the eve of Yom Kippur in Tel Aviv.\nIn 1973, an air raid siren was sounded on the afternoon of Yom Kippur and radio broadcasts were resumed to alert the public to the surprise attack on Israel by Egypt and Syria that launched the Yom Kippur War.\nObservance by athletes.\nSince the early 20th century, numerous Jewish athletes have opted not to participate in their sport on Yom Kippur if a sporting event coincides with the High Holy Day. Such incidents throw into sharp highlight the conflict many Jewish people face between social pressures and personal beliefs on a daily basis. Athletes observing Yom Kippur are often lauded for their decision not to play, which is also seen as a source of pride by many in the Jewish community.\nThe most famous example of this phenomenon is Hall of Fame pitcher Sandy Koufax of Major League Baseball's Los Angeles Dodgers, who refused to play on Yom Kippur when it clashed with Game 1 of the 1965 World Series which Koufax, as the team's best pitcher, was slated to start. Koufax garnered national attention for his decision, which was seen as an example of the conflict between social pressures and personal beliefs.\nSimilarly, another Baseball Hall of Famer, first baseman Hank Greenberg, garnered national attention in 1934 when he refused to play on Yom Kippur, even though his Detroit Tigers were in the middle of a pennant race and Greenberg himself was leading the league in runs batted in. When Greenberg arrived in synagogue on Yom Kippur, the service stopped suddenly, and the congregation gave an embarrassed Greenberg a standing ovation.\nThe examples of Greenberg and Koufax have been followed by numerous athletes, including fellow baseball players Shawn Green, Kevin Youkilis, Brad Ausmus, and Art Shamsky. Outside of baseball, notable players to sit out Yom Kippur include: football player Gabe Carimi, golfer Laetitia Beck, chess player Boris Gelfand, and professional wrestler Bill Goldberg.\nRecognition by the United Nations.\nSince 2016 the United Nations has officially recognized Yom Kippur, stating that from then on no official meetings would take place on the day. In addition, the United Nations stated that, beginning in 2016, they would have nine official holidays and seven floating holidays of which each employee would be able to choose one. It stated that the floating holidays will be Yom Kippur, Day of Vesak, Diwali, Gurpurab, Orthodox Christmas, Orthodox Good Friday, and Presidents' Day. This was the first time the United Nations officially recognized any Jewish holiday.\nDate of Yom Kippur.\nYom Kippur falls each year on the tenth day of the Jewish month of Tishrei, which is nine days after the first day of Rosh Hashanah. In terms of the Gregorian calendar, the earliest date on which Yom Kippur can fall is September 14, as happened most recently in 1899 and 2013. The latest Yom Kippur can occur relative to the Gregorian dates is on October 14, as happened in 1967 and will happen again in 2043. After 2089, the differences between the Hebrew calendar and the Gregorian calendar will result in Yom Kippur falling no earlier than September 15. Gregorian calendar dates for recent and upcoming Yom Kippur holidays are:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "34385", "revid": "88809", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34385", "title": "Yeast", "text": "Informal group of fungi\nYeasts are eukaryotic, single-celled microorganisms classified as members of the fungus kingdom. The first yeast originated hundreds of millions of years ago, and at least 1,500 species are currently recognized. They are estimated to constitute 1% of all described fungal species.\nSome yeast species have the ability to develop multicellular characteristics by forming strings of connected budding cells known as pseudohyphae or false hyphae, or quickly evolve into a multicellular cluster with specialised cell organelle functions. Yeast sizes vary greatly, depending on species and environment, typically measuring 3\u20134\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter, although some yeasts can grow to 40\u00a0\u03bcm in size. Most yeasts reproduce asexually by mitosis, and many do so by the asymmetric division process known as budding. With their single-celled growth habit, yeasts can be contrasted with molds, which grow hyphae. Fungal species that can take both forms (depending on temperature or other conditions) are called dimorphic fungi.\nThe yeast species \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" converts carbohydrates to carbon dioxide and alcohols through the process of fermentation. The products of this reaction have been used in baking and the production of alcoholic beverages for thousands of years. \"S. cerevisiae\" is also an important model organism in modern cell biology research, and is one of the most thoroughly studied eukaryotic microorganisms. Researchers have cultured it in order to understand the biology of the eukaryotic cell and ultimately human biology in great detail. Other species of yeasts, such as \"Candida albicans\", are opportunistic pathogens and can cause infections in humans. Yeasts have recently been used to generate electricity in microbial fuel cells and to produce ethanol for the biofuel industry.\nYeasts do not form a single taxonomic or phylogenetic grouping. The term \"yeast\" is often taken as a synonym for \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\", but the phylogenetic diversity of yeasts is shown by their placement in two separate phyla: the Ascomycota and the Basidiomycota. The budding yeasts, or \"true yeasts\", are classified in the order Saccharomycetales, within the phylum Ascomycota.\nHistory.\nThe word \"yeast\" comes from Old English , and from the Indo-European root , meaning \"boil\", \"foam\", or \"bubble\". Yeast microbes are probably one of the earliest domesticated organisms. Archaeologists digging in Egyptian ruins found early grinding stones and baking chambers for yeast-raised bread, as well as drawings of 4,000-year-old bakeries and breweries. Vessels studied from several archaeological sites in Israel (dating to around 5,000, 3,000 and 2,500 years ago), which were believed to have contained alcoholic beverages (beer and mead), were found to contain yeast colonies that had survived over the millennia, providing the first direct biological evidence of yeast use in early cultures. In 1680, Dutch naturalist Anton van Leeuwenhoek first microscopically observed yeast, but at the time did not consider them to be living organisms, but rather globular structures as researchers were doubtful whether yeasts were algae or fungi. Theodor Schwann recognized them as fungi in 1837.\nIn 1857, French microbiologist Louis Pasteur showed that by bubbling oxygen into the yeast broth, cell growth could be increased, but fermentation was inhibited\u00a0\u2013 an observation later called the \"Pasteur effect\". In the paper \"M\u00e9moire sur la fermentation alcoolique,\" Pasteur proved that alcoholic fermentation was conducted by living yeasts and not by a chemical catalyst.\nBy the late 18th century two yeast strains used in brewing had been identified: \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" (top-fermenting yeast) and \"S. pastorianus\" (bottom-fermenting yeast). \"S.\u00a0cerevisiae\" has been sold commercially by the Dutch for bread-making since 1780; while, around 1800, the Germans started producing \"S.\u00a0cerevisiae\" in the form of cream. In 1825, a method was developed to remove the liquid so the yeast could be prepared as solid blocks. The industrial production of yeast blocks was enhanced by the introduction of the filter press in 1867. In 1872, Baron Max de Springer developed a manufacturing process to create granulated yeast from beetroot molasses, a technique that was used until the first World War. In the United States, naturally occurring airborne yeasts were used almost exclusively until commercial yeast was marketed at the Centennial Exposition in 1876 in Philadelphia, where Charles L. Fleischmann exhibited the product and a process to use it, as well as serving the resultant baked bread.\nThe mechanical refrigerator (first patented in the 1850s in Europe) liberated brewers and winemakers from seasonal constraints for the first time and allowed them to exit cellars and other earthen environments. For John Molson, who made his livelihood in Montreal prior to the development of the refrigerator, the brewing season lasted from September through to May. The same seasonal restrictions formerly governed the distiller's art.\nNutrition and growth.\nYeasts are chemoorganotrophs, as they use organic compounds as a source of energy and do not require sunlight to grow. Carbon is obtained mostly from hexose sugars, such as glucose and fructose, or disaccharides such as sucrose and maltose. Some species can metabolize pentose sugars such as ribose, alcohols, and organic acids. Yeast species either require oxygen for aerobic cellular respiration (obligate aerobes) or are anaerobic, but also have aerobic methods of energy production (facultative anaerobes). Unlike bacteria, no known yeast species grow only anaerobically (obligate anaerobes). Most yeasts grow best in a neutral or slightly acidic pH environment.\nYeasts vary in regard to the temperature range in which they grow best. For example, \"Leucosporidium frigidum\" grows at , \"Saccharomyces telluris\" at , and \"Candida slooffi\" at . The cells can survive freezing under certain conditions, with viability decreasing over time.\nIn general, yeasts are grown in the laboratory on solid growth media or in liquid broths. Common media used for the cultivation of yeasts include potato dextrose agar or potato dextrose broth, Wallerstein Laboratories nutrient agar, yeast peptone dextrose agar, and yeast mould agar or broth. Home brewers who cultivate yeast frequently use dried malt extract and agar as a solid growth medium. The fungicide cycloheximide is sometimes added to yeast growth media to inhibit the growth of \"Saccharomyces\" yeasts and select for wild/indigenous yeast species. This will change the yeast process.\nThe appearance of a white, thready yeast, commonly known as kahm yeast, is often a byproduct of the lactofermentation (or pickling) of certain vegetables. It is usually the result of exposure to air. Although harmless, it can give pickled vegetables a bad flavor and must be removed regularly during fermentation.\nEcology.\nYeasts are very common in the environment, and are often isolated from sugar-rich materials. Examples include naturally occurring yeasts on the skins of fruits and berries (such as grapes, apples, or peaches), and exudates from plants (such as plant saps or cacti). Some yeasts are found in association with soil and insects. Yeasts from the soil and from the skins of fruits and berries have been shown to dominate fungal succession during fruit decay. The ecological function and biodiversity of yeasts are relatively unknown compared to those of other microorganisms. Yeasts, including \"Candida albicans\", \"Rhodotorula rubra\", \"Torulopsis\" and \"Trichosporon cutaneum\", have been found living in between people's toes as part of their skin flora. Yeasts are also present in the gut flora of mammals and some insects and even deep-sea environments host an array of yeasts.\nAn Indian study of seven bee species and nine plant species found 45 species from 16 genera colonize the nectaries of flowers and honey stomachs of bees. Most were members of the genus \"Candida\"; the most common species in honey stomachs was \"Dekkera intermedia\" and in flower nectaries, \"Candida blankii\". Yeast colonising nectaries of the stinking hellebore have been found to raise the temperature of the flower, which may aid in attracting pollinators by increasing the evaporation of volatile organic compounds. A black yeast has been recorded as a partner in a complex relationship between ants, their mutualistic fungus, a fungal parasite of the fungus and a bacterium that kills the parasite. The yeast has a negative effect on the bacteria that normally produce antibiotics to kill the parasite, so may affect the ants' health by allowing the parasite to spread. A different yeast species is grown by fungus-growing ants of the genus \"Cyphomyrmex\".\nCertain strains of some species of yeasts produce proteins called yeast killer toxins that allow them to eliminate competing strains. (See main article on killer yeast.) This can cause problems for winemaking but could potentially also be used to advantage by using killer toxin-producing strains to make the wine. Yeast killer toxins may also have medical applications in treating yeast infections (see \"Pathogenic yeasts\" section below).\nMarine yeasts, defined as the yeasts that are isolated from marine environments, are able to grow better on a medium prepared using seawater rather than freshwater. The first marine yeasts were isolated by Bernhard Fischer in 1894 from the Atlantic Ocean, and those were identified as \"Torula\" sp. and \"Mycoderma\" sp. Following this discovery, various other marine yeasts have been isolated from around the world from different sources, including seawater, seaweeds, marine fish and mammals. Among these isolates, some marine yeasts originated from terrestrial habitats (grouped as facultative marine yeast), which were brought to and survived in marine environments. The other marine yeasts were grouped as obligate or indigenous marine yeasts, which are confined to marine habitats. However, no sufficient evidence has been found to explain the indispensability of seawater for obligate marine yeasts. It has been reported that marine yeasts are able to produce many bioactive substances, such as amino acids, glucans, glutathione, toxins, enzymes, phytase, and vitamins with potential applications in the food, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and chemical industries as well as for marine culture and environmental protection. Marine yeast was successfully used to produce bioethanol using seawater-based media which will potentially reduce the water footprint of bioethanol.\nReproduction.\nYeasts, like all fungi, may have asexual and sexual reproductive cycles. The most common mode of vegetative growth in yeast is asexual reproduction by budding, where a small bud (also known as a bleb or daughter cell) is formed on the parent cell. The nucleus of the parent cell splits, producing a daughter nucleus that migrates into the daughter cell. The bud then continues to grow until it separates from the parent cell, forming a new cell. The daughter cell produced during the budding process is generally smaller than the mother cell. Some yeasts, including \"Schizosaccharomyces pombe\", reproduce by fission instead of budding, and thereby creating two identically sized daughter cells.\nIn general, under high-stress conditions such as nutrient starvation, haploid cells will die; under the same conditions, however, diploid cells can undergo sporulation, entering sexual reproduction (meiosis) and producing a variety of haploid spores, which can go on to mate (conjugate), reforming the diploid.\nThe haploid fission yeast \"Schizosaccharomyces pombe\" is a facultative sexual microorganism that can undergo mating when nutrients are limited. Exposure of \"S. pombe\" to hydrogen peroxide, an agent that causes oxidative stress leading to oxidative DNA damage, strongly induces mating and the formation of meiotic spores. The budding yeast \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" reproduces by mitosis as diploid cells when nutrients are abundant, but when starved, this yeast undergoes meiosis to form haploid spores. Haploid cells may then reproduce asexually by mitosis. Katz Ezov et al. presented evidence that in natural \"S. cerevisiae\" populations clonal reproduction and selfing (in the form of intratetrad mating) predominate. In nature, the mating of haploid cells to form diploid cells is most often between members of the same clonal population and out-crossing is uncommon. Analysis of the ancestry of natural \"S. cerevisiae\" strains led to the conclusion that out-crossing occurs only about once every 50,000 cell divisions. These observations suggest that the possible long-term benefits of outcrossing (e.g. generation of diversity) are likely to be insufficient for generally maintaining sex from one generation to the next. Rather, a short-term benefit, such as recombinational repair during meiosis, may be the key to the maintenance of sex in \"S. cerevisiae\".\nSome pucciniomycete yeasts, in particular species of \"Sporidiobolus\" and \"Sporobolomyces\", produce aerially dispersed, asexual ballistoconidia.\nUses.\nThe useful physiological properties of yeast have led to their use in the field of biotechnology. Fermentation of sugars by yeast is the oldest and largest application of this technology. Many types of yeasts are used for making many foods: baker's yeast in bread production, brewer's yeast in beer fermentation, and yeast in wine fermentation and for xylitol production. So-called red rice yeast is actually a mold, \"Monascus purpureus\". Yeasts include some of the most widely used model organisms for genetics and cell biology.\nAlcoholic beverages.\nAlcoholic beverages are defined as beverages that contain ethanol (C2H5OH). This ethanol is almost always produced by fermentation\u00a0\u2013 the metabolism of carbohydrates by certain species of yeasts under anaerobic or low-oxygen conditions. Beverages such as mead, wine, beer, or distilled spirits all use yeast at some stage of their production. A distilled beverage is a beverage containing ethanol that has been purified by distillation. Carbohydrate-containing plant material is fermented by yeast, producing a dilute solution of ethanol in the process. Spirits such as whiskey and rum are prepared by distilling these dilute solutions of ethanol. Components other than ethanol are collected in the condensate, including water, esters, and other alcohols, which (in addition to that provided by the oak in which it may be aged) account for the flavour of the beverage.\nBeer.\nBrewing yeasts may be classed as \"top-cropping\" (or \"top-fermenting\") and \"bottom-cropping\" (or \"bottom-fermenting\"). Top-cropping yeasts are so called because they form a foam at the top of the wort during fermentation. An example of a top-cropping yeast is \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\", sometimes called an \"ale yeast\". Bottom-cropping yeasts are typically used to produce lager-type beers, though they can also produce ale-type beers. These yeasts ferment well at low temperatures. An example of bottom-cropping yeast is \"Saccharomyces pastorianus\", formerly known as \"S.\u00a0carlsbergensis\".\nDecades ago, taxonomists reclassified \"S.\u00a0carlsbergensis\" (uvarum) as a member of \"S.\u00a0cerevisiae\", noting that the only distinct difference between the two is metabolic. Lager strains of \"S.\u00a0cerevisiae\" secrete an enzyme called melibiase, allowing them to hydrolyse melibiose, a disaccharide, into more fermentable monosaccharides. Top- and bottom-cropping and cold- and warm-fermenting distinctions are largely generalizations used by laypersons to communicate to the general public.\nThe most common top-cropping brewer's yeast, \"S.\u00a0cerevisiae\", is the same species as the common baking yeast. Brewer's yeast is also very rich in essential minerals and the B vitamins (except B12), a feature exploited in food products made from leftover (by-product) yeast from brewing. However, baking and brewing yeasts typically belong to different strains, cultivated to favour different characteristics: baking yeast strains are more aggressive, to carbonate dough in the shortest amount of time possible; brewing yeast strains act more slowly but tend to produce fewer off-flavours and tolerate higher alcohol concentrations (with some strains, up to 22%).\n\"Dekkera/Brettanomyces\" is a genus of yeast known for its important role in the production of 'lambic' and specialty sour ales, along with the secondary conditioning of a particular Belgian Trappist beer. The taxonomy of the genus \"Brettanomyces\" has been debated since its early discovery and has seen many reclassifications over the years. Early classification was based on a few species that reproduced asexually (anamorph form) through multipolar budding. Shortly after, the formation of ascospores was observed and the genus \"Dekkera\", which reproduces sexually (teleomorph form), was introduced as part of the taxonomy. The current taxonomy includes five species within the genera of \"Dekkera/Brettanomyces\". Those are the anamorphs \"Brettanomyces bruxellensis\", \"Brettanomyces anomalus\", \"Brettanomyces custersianus\", \"Brettanomyces naardenensis\", and \"Brettanomyces nanus\", with teleomorphs existing for the first two species, \"Dekkera bruxellensis\" and \"Dekkera anomala\". The distinction between \"Dekkera\" and \"Brettanomyces\" is arguable, with Oelofse et al. (2008) citing Loureiro and Malfeito-Ferreira from 2006 when they affirmed that current molecular DNA detection techniques have uncovered no variance between the anamorph and teleomorph states. Over the past decade, \"Brettanomyces\" spp. have seen an increasing use in the craft-brewing sector of the industry, with a handful of breweries having produced beers that were primarily fermented with pure cultures of \"Brettanomyces\" spp. This has occurred out of experimentation, as very little information exists regarding pure culture fermentative capabilities and the aromatic compounds produced by various strains. \"Dekkera\"/\"Brettanomyces\" spp. have been the subjects of numerous studies conducted over the past century, although a majority of the recent research has focused on enhancing the knowledge of the wine industry. Recent research on eight \"Brettanomyces\" strains available in the brewing industry focused on strain-specific fermentations and identified the major compounds produced during pure culture anaerobic fermentation in wort.\nWine.\nYeast is used in winemaking, where it converts the sugars present (glucose and fructose) in grape juice (must) into ethanol. Yeast is normally already present on grape skins. Fermentation can be done with this endogenous \"wild yeast\", but this procedure gives unpredictable results, which depend upon the exact types of yeast species present. For this reason, a pure yeast culture is usually added to the must; this yeast quickly dominates the fermentation. The wild yeasts are repressed, which ensures a reliable and predictable fermentation.\nMost added wine yeasts are strains of \"S. cerevisiae\", though not all strains of the species are suitable. Different \"S.\u00a0cerevisiae\" yeast strains have differing physiological and fermentative properties, therefore the actual strain of yeast selected can have a direct impact on the finished wine. Significant research has been undertaken into the development of novel wine yeast strains that produce atypical flavour profiles or increased complexity in wines.\nThe growth of some yeasts, such as \"Zygosaccharomyces\" and \"Brettanomyces\", in wine can result in wine faults and subsequent spoilage. \"Brettanomyces\" produces an array of metabolites when growing in wine, some of which are volatile phenolic compounds. Together, these compounds are often referred to as \"\"Brettanomyces\" character\", and are often described as \"antiseptic\" or \"barnyard\" type aromas. \"Brettanomyces\" is a significant contributor to wine faults within the wine industry.\nResearchers from the University of British Columbia, Canada, have found a new strain of yeast that has reduced amines. The amines in red wine and Chardonnay produce off-flavors and cause headaches and hypertension in some people. About 30% of people are sensitive to biogenic amines, such as histamines.\nBaking.\nYeast, most commonly \"S.\u00a0cerevisiae\", is used in baking as a leavening agent, converting the fermentable sugars present in dough into carbon dioxide. This causes the dough to expand or rise as gas forms pockets or bubbles. When the dough is baked, the yeast dies and the air pockets \"set\", giving the baked product a soft and spongy texture. The use of potatoes, water from potato boiling, eggs, or sugar in a bread dough accelerates the growth of yeast. Most yeasts used in baking are of the same species common in alcoholic fermentation. In addition, \"Saccharomyces exiguus\" (also known as \"S.\u00a0minor\"), a wild yeast found on plants, fruits, and grains, is occasionally used for baking. In breadmaking, the yeast initially respires aerobically, producing carbon dioxide and water. When the oxygen is depleted, fermentation begins, producing ethanol as a waste product; however, this evaporates during baking.\nIt is not known when yeast was first used to bake bread. The first records that show this use came from Ancient Egypt. Researchers speculate a mixture of flour meal and water was left longer than usual on a warm day and the yeasts that occur in natural contaminants of the flour caused it to ferment before baking. The resulting bread would have been lighter and tastier than the normal flat, hard cake.\nToday, there are several retailers of baker's yeast; one of the earlier developments in North America is Fleischmann's Yeast, in 1868. During World War II, Fleischmann's developed a granulated active dry yeast which did not require refrigeration, had a longer shelf life than fresh yeast, and rose twice as fast. Baker's yeast is also sold as a fresh yeast compressed into a square \"cake\". This form perishes quickly, so must be used soon after production. A weak solution of water and sugar can be used to determine whether yeast is expired. In the solution, active yeast will foam and bubble as it ferments the sugar into ethanol and carbon dioxide. Some recipes refer to this as proofing the yeast, as it \"proves\" (tests) the viability of the yeast before the other ingredients are added. When a sourdough starter is used, flour and water are added instead of sugar; this is referred to as proofing the sponge.\nWhen yeast is used for making bread, it is mixed with flour, salt, and warm water or milk. The dough is kneaded until it is smooth, and then left to rise, sometimes until it has doubled in size. The dough is then shaped into loaves. Some bread doughs are knocked back after one rising and left to rise again (this is called dough proofing) and then baked. A longer rising time gives a better flavor, but the yeast can fail to raise the bread in the final stages if it is left for too long initially.\nBioremediation.\nSome yeasts can find potential application in the field of bioremediation. One such yeast, \"Yarrowia lipolytica\", is known to degrade palm oil mill effluent, TNT (an explosive material), and other hydrocarbons, such as alkanes, fatty acids, fats and oils. It can also tolerate high concentrations of salt and heavy metals, and is being investigated for its potential as a heavy metal biosorbent. \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" has potential to bioremediate toxic pollutants like arsenic from industrial effluent. Bronze statues are known to be degraded by certain species of yeast. Different yeasts from Brazilian gold mines bioaccumulate free and complexed silver ions.\nIndustrial ethanol production.\nThe ability of yeast to convert sugar into ethanol has been harnessed by the biotechnology industry to produce ethanol fuel. The process starts by milling a feedstock, such as sugar cane, field corn, or other cereal grains, and then adding dilute sulfuric acid, or fungal alpha amylase enzymes, to break down the starches into complex sugars. A glucoamylase is then added to break the complex sugars down into simple sugars. After this, yeasts are added to convert the simple sugars to ethanol, which is then distilled off to obtain ethanol up to 96% in purity.\n\"Saccharomyces\" yeasts have been genetically engineered to ferment xylose, one of the major fermentable sugars present in cellulosic biomasses, such as agriculture residues, paper wastes, and wood chips. Such a development means ethanol can be efficiently produced from more inexpensive feedstocks, making cellulosic ethanol fuel a more competitively priced alternative to gasoline fuels.\nNonalcoholic beverages.\nA number of sweet carbonated beverages can be produced by the same methods as beer, except the fermentation is stopped sooner, producing carbon dioxide, but only trace amounts of alcohol, leaving a significant amount of residual sugar in the drink.\nFoods and &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;nutritional supplements.\nYeast is used as an ingredient in foods for its umami flavor, in much of the same way that monosodium glutamate (MSG) is used and, like MSG, yeast often contains free glutamic acid. Examples include:\nBoth types of yeast foods above are rich in B-complex vitamins (besides vitamin B12 unless fortified), making them an attractive nutritional supplement to vegans. The same vitamins are also found in some yeast-fermented products mentioned above, such as kvass. Nutritional yeast in particular is naturally low in fat and sodium and a source of protein and vitamins as well as other minerals and cofactors required for growth. Many brands of nutritional yeast and yeast extract spreads, though not all, are fortified with vitamin B12, which is produced separately by bacteria.\nIn 1920, the Fleischmann Yeast Company began to promote yeast cakes in a \"Yeast for Health\" campaign. They initially emphasized yeast as a source of vitamins, good for skin and digestion. Their later advertising claimed a much broader range of health benefits, and was censured as misleading by the Federal Trade Commission. The fad for yeast cakes lasted until the late 1930s.\nProbiotics.\nSome probiotic supplements use the yeast \"S.\u00a0boulardii\" to maintain and restore the natural flora in the gastrointestinal tract. \"S.\u00a0boulardii\" has been shown to reduce the symptoms of acute diarrhea, reduce the chance of infection by \"Clostridium difficile\" (often identified simply as C. difficile or C. diff), reduce bowel movements in diarrhea-predominant IBS patients, and reduce the incidence of antibiotic-, traveler's-, and HIV/AIDS-associated diarrheas.\nAquarium hobby.\nYeast is often used by aquarium hobbyists to generate carbon dioxide (CO2) to nourish plants in planted aquaria. CO2 levels from yeast are more difficult to regulate than those from pressurized CO2 systems. However, the low cost of yeast makes it a widely used alternative.\nScientific research.\nSeveral yeasts, in particular \"S.\u00a0cerevisiae\" and \"S. pombe\", have been widely used in genetics and cell biology, largely because they are simple eukaryotic cells, serving as a model for all eukaryotes, including humans, for the study of fundamental cellular processes such as the cell cycle, DNA replication, recombination, cell division, and metabolism. Also, yeasts are easily manipulated and cultured in the laboratory, which has allowed for the development of powerful standard techniques, such as yeast two-hybrid, synthetic genetic array analysis, and tetrad analysis. Many proteins important in human biology were first discovered by studying their homologues in yeast; these proteins include cell cycle proteins, signaling proteins, and protein-processing enzymes.\nOn 24 April 1996, \"S.\u00a0cerevisiae\" was announced to be the first eukaryote to have its genome, consisting of 12 million base pairs, fully sequenced as part of the Genome Project. At the time, it was the most complex organism to have its full genome sequenced, and the work of seven years and the involvement of more than 100 laboratories to accomplish. The second yeast species to have its genome sequenced was \"Schizosaccharomyces pombe\", which was completed in 2002. It was the sixth eukaryotic genome sequenced and consists of 13.8\u00a0million base pairs. As of 2014, over 50 yeast species have had their genomes sequenced and published.\nGenomic and functional gene annotation of the two major yeast models can be accessed via their respective model organism databases: SGD and PomBase.\nGenetically engineered biofactories.\nVarious yeast species have been genetically engineered to efficiently produce various drugs, a technique called metabolic engineering. \"S.\u00a0cerevisiae\" is easy to genetically engineer; its physiology, metabolism and genetics are well known, and it is amenable for use in harsh industrial conditions. A wide variety of chemical in different classes can be produced by engineered yeast, including phenolics, isoprenoids, alkaloids, and polyketides. About 20% of biopharmaceuticals are produced in \"S.\u00a0cerevisiae\", including insulin, vaccines for hepatitis, and human serum albumin.\nPathogenic yeasts.\nSome species of yeast are opportunistic pathogens that can cause infection in people with compromised immune systems. \"Cryptococcus neoformans\" and \"Cryptococcus gattii\" are significant pathogens of immunocompromised people. They are the species primarily responsible for cryptococcosis, a fungal infection that occurs in about one million HIV/AIDS patients, causing over 600,000 deaths annually. The cells of these yeast are surrounded by a rigid polysaccharide capsule, which helps to prevent them from being recognised and engulfed by white blood cells in the human body.\nYeasts of the genus \"Candida\", another group of opportunistic pathogens, cause oral and vaginal infections in humans, known as candidiasis. \"Candida\" is commonly found as a commensal yeast in the mucous membranes of humans and other warm-blooded animals. However, sometimes these same strains can become pathogenic. The yeast cells sprout a hyphal outgrowth, which locally penetrates the mucosal membrane, causing irritation and shedding of the tissues. A book from the 1980s listed the pathogenic yeasts of candidiasis in probable descending order of virulence for humans as: \"C.\u00a0albicans\", \"C.\u00a0tropicalis\", \"C.\u00a0stellatoidea\", \"C.\u00a0glabrata\", \"C.\u00a0krusei\", \"C.\u00a0parapsilosis\", \"C.\u00a0guilliermondii\", \"C.\u00a0viswanathii\", \"C.\u00a0lusitaniae\", and \"Rhodotorula mucilaginosa\". \"Candida glabrata\" is the second most common \"Candida\" pathogen after \"C.\u00a0albicans\", causing infections of the urogenital tract, and of the bloodstream (candidemia). \"C.\u00a0auris\" has been more recently identified.\nFood spoilage.\nYeasts are able to grow in foods with a low pH (5.0 or lower) and in the presence of sugars, organic acids, and other easily metabolized carbon sources. During their growth, yeasts metabolize some food components and produce metabolic end products. This causes the physical, chemical, and sensible properties of a food to change, and the food is spoiled. The growth of yeast within food products is often seen on their surfaces, as in cheeses or meats, or by the fermentation of sugars in beverages, such as juices, and semiliquid products, such as syrups and jams. The yeast of the genus \"Zygosaccharomyces\" have had a long history as spoilage yeasts within the food industry. This is mainly because these species can grow in the presence of high sucrose, ethanol, acetic acid, sorbic acid, benzoic acid, and sulfur dioxide concentrations, representing some of the commonly used food preservation methods. Methylene blue is used to test for the presence of live yeast cells. In oenology, the major spoilage yeast is \"Brettanomyces bruxellensis\".\n\"Candida blankii\" has been detected in Iberian ham and meat.\nSymbiosis.\nAn Indian study of seven bee species and nine plant species found 45 yeast species from 16 genera colonise the nectaries of flowers and honey stomachs of bees. Most were members of the genus \"Candida\"; the most common species in honey bee stomachs was \"Dekkera intermedia\", while the most common species colonising flower nectaries was \"Candida blankii\". Although the mechanism is not fully understood, it was found that \"A. indica\" flowers more if \"Candida blankii\" is present.\nIn another example, \"Spathaspora passalidarum\", found in the digestive tract of bess beetles, aids the digestion of plant cells by fermenting xylose.\nMany fruits produce different types of sugars that attract yeasts, which ferment the sugar and turns it into alcohol. Fruit eating mammals find the scent of alcohol attractive as it indicates a ripe, sugary fruit which provides more nutrition. In turn, the mammals helps disperse both the fruit's seeds and the yeast's spores.\nYeast and small hive beetle have mutualistic relationship. While small hive beetle is attracted by the pheromone released by the host honeybee, yeast can produce a similar pheromone which have the same attractive effect to the small hive beetle. Therefore, yeast facilitates SHB's infestation if the beehive contains yeast inside.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Known for its natural beauty, agricultural significance, and as one of Australia's prominent wine-producing areas, the valley stretches from the upper reaches of the river near its source in the Yarra Ranges National Park down to the flatter lands as it approaches Melbourne.\nGeography and environment.\nThe Yarra River begins in the rugged, forested area of the Yarra Ranges, approximately 240 kilometres (150\u00a0mi) east of Melbourne's central business district. The valley runs along the river as it flows westward, descending through a series of environmental zones from mountain ranges and dense bushland to gentler, fertile plains that support vineyards and farmland. The term \"Yarra Valley\" commonly refers to the upper and middle regions surrounding the river, where the landscape is defined by rolling hills and agricultural lands.\nUpper Yarra Valley.\nThe Upper Yarra Valley refers to the Yarra River catchment upstream of Woori Yallock and includes towns like Warburton, Yarra Junction, and Launching Place. Historically part of the former Shire of Upper Yarra, this sub-region is known for its forested mountains and national parks, as well as its cooler climate, which impacts local agriculture and viticulture. This part of the valley is popular for outdoor recreation, including bushwalking, cycling, and wildlife observation.\nEconomy and agriculture.\nThe Yarra Valley has a diverse economy with agriculture playing a vital role. The valley's mild climate and fertile soils make it ideal for producing a variety of crops, including grapes, fruits, and vegetables. The region is renowned for its cool-climate wine production, particularly chardonnay, pinot noir, and sparkling wine. The wine industry in the Yarra Valley is one of Australia's oldest, with the first vineyards planted in the 1830s, and has since grown to encompass over 80 wineries.\nLocal farms also produce honey, dairy, and artisanal products, contributing to a robust food industry. The agricultural output supports a growing culinary scene, with regional restaurants and markets offering farm-to-table produce and gourmet foods that are increasingly popular with both locals and visitors.\nTourism.\nThe Yarra Valley is one of Victoria's primary tourism regions, attracting visitors with its natural landscapes, wineries, and outdoor activities. The Lilydale to Warburton Rail Trail is a popular 40-kilometre track that follows an old railway line, frequented by cyclists, walkers, and equestrians. Other natural attractions include the Healesville Sanctuary, a conservation-focused wildlife park that showcases native Australian animals, and several parks and reserves in the Yarra Ranges, which offer hiking trails and scenic views.\nWinery tours are a major attraction, drawing tourists from across Australia and internationally. Many wineries offer cellar door tastings and restaurants with views over the vineyards, making the Yarra Valley a destination for food and wine tourism.\nTowns and local governance.\nTowns within the Yarra Valley are governed by the Shire of Yarra Ranges and the Shire of Nillumbik.\nNotable towns include:\nThese towns contribute to the Yarra Valley's culture, each with unique attractions and amenities that make them popular hubs for tourists exploring the area.\nCultural significance and media.\nThe Yarra Valley has served as a filming location for various television and film productions, including the Australian series \"The Saddle Club\", which used the valley's landscapes to depict rural Australia. Additionally, the region has a vibrant art scene, with local galleries and workshops showcasing works inspired by the valley's natural beauty.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "34392", "revid": "20483999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34392", "title": "Japanese yen", "text": "Currency of Japan\nThe is the official currency of Japan. It is the third-most traded currency in the foreign exchange market, after the United States dollar and the euro. It is also widely used as a third reserve currency after the US dollar and the euro.\nThe New Currency Act of 1871 introduced Japan's modern currency system, with the yen defined as of gold, or of silver, and divided decimally into 100 \"sen\" or 1,000 \"rin\". The yen replaced the previous Tokugawa coinage as well as the various \"hansatsu\" paper currencies issued by feudal \"han\" (fiefs). The Bank of Japan was founded in 1882 and given a monopoly on controlling the money supply.\nFollowing World War II, the yen lost much of its pre-war value as Japan faced a debt crisis and hyperinflation. Under the Bretton Woods system, the yen was pegged to the US dollar alongside other major currencies. After this system was abandoned in 1971 with the Nixon Shock, the short-lived Smithsonian Agreement temporarily reinstated a fixed exchange rate. However, since the end of that system in February 1973, the yen has been a floating currency.\nThe Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Japan have sometimes intervened in the currency market in recent years, to try to slow down exchange rate movements. There were intermittent interventions from 1998 to 2003 and from 2010 to 2011 to curb excessive and speculative appreciation of the yen, and again in 2022 and 2024 to slow down speculative selling of the currency. The first two interventions were coordinated with respective countries, and the IMF has repeatedly stated that Japan is \"committed to a flexible exchange rate\".\nPronunciation and etymology.\nThe name \"yen\" derives from the Japanese word , which borrows its phonetic reading from Chinese yuan, similar to North Korean won and South Korean won. Originally, the Chinese had traded silver in mass called sycees, and when Spanish and Mexican silver coins arrived from the Philippines, the Chinese called them \"silver rounds\" () for their circular shapes. The coins and the name also appeared in Japan. While the Chinese eventually replaced with , the Japanese continued to use the same word, which was given the \"shinjitai\" form in reforms at the end of World War\u00a0II.\nThe spelling and pronunciation \"yen\" is standard in English, because when Japan was first encountered by Europeans around the 16th century, Japanese () and () were both pronounced . Accordingly, Portuguese missionaries spelled them as \"ye\". By the middle of the 18th century, and came to be pronounced as in modern Japanese, although some regions retain the pronunciation. Walter Henry Medhurst, who had neither been to Japan nor met any Japanese people, having consulted mainly a Japanese-Dutch dictionary, spelled some \"e\"s as \"ye\" in his \"An English and Japanese, and Japanese and English Vocabulary\" (1830). In the early Meiji era, the American physician and translator James Curtis Hepburn, following Medhurst, spelled all \"e\"s as \"ye\" in his \"A Japanese and English dictionary\" (1867); in Japanese, \"e\" and \"i\" are slightly palatalized, somewhat as in Russian. That was the first full-scale Japanese-English/English-Japanese dictionary, which had a strong influence on Westerners in Japan and probably prompted the spelling \"yen\", which appeared in the 2nd edition (1872). Hepburn revised most \"ye\"s to \"e\" in the 3rd edition (1886) to mirror the contemporary pronunciation, except \"yen\".\nHistory.\nEarly history (1868\u20131876).\nAlthough the Edo Shogunate collapsed with the Meiji Restoration and a new government was born, there was no immediate change to the monetary system. During this unstable period, the confusion caused by this form of exchange caused economic turmoil. The gold (counting money) system of eastern Japan and the silver (weighing money) system of the western Japan were not unified, and the difference in the gold-silver ratio caused a large amount of gold to flow overseas at the end of the Tokugawa shogunate. Emperor Meiji responded to this by appointing \u014ckuma Shigenobu as head of Japan's monetary reform program. He worked with Inoue Kaoru, It\u014d Hirobumi, and Shibusawa Eiichi to run the Ministry of Finance, seeking to introduce a modern monetary system into Japan. \u014ckuma eventually proposed that coins, which were previously square, be made into circular discs, and that the names of the traditional currencies, ry\u014d (\u4e21), bu (\u5206) and shu (\u6731), be unified into yen (\u5186), which was accepted by the government. Other rejected proposals included physical weight units of \"Fun\" and \"Momme\" which never made it past the pattern stage.\nThe first gold yen coins consisted of 2, 5, and 20 yen coins which were struck throughout 1870. Five yen coins were first struck in gold for the Japanese government in 1870 at the San Francisco Mint. During this time a new mint was being established at Osaka, but this did not receive the gold bullion needed for coinage until the following year. Gold bullion was delivered from private Japanese citizens, foreigners, and the Japanese government. Initially the government opted for silver, which would become the standard unit of value, leaving gold coinage as a subsidiary. While gold coinage could not be produced domestically in 1870, the mint at Osaka could produce silver coins, and these included denominations of 5, 10, 20, and 50 sen. None of these coins dated \"1870\" circulated until the Meiji government officially adopted the \"yen\" as Japan's modern unit of currency on June 27, 1871. This Act formally stipulated the adoption of the decimal accounting system of \"yen\" (1, ), \"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;sen\" (&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u2044100, ), and \"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;rin\" (&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20441000, ). The new currency was gradually introduced beginning from July of that year.\nJapanese yen-denominated paper currency was also conceived with the coins in 1870, as Meiji Tsuho notes by Italian engraver Edoardo Chiossone. These were released as fiat currency in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 50, and 100 yen along with subsidiary notes of 10, 20, and 50 sen in 1872. Almost concurrently, the government established a series of national banks modeled after the system in the United States, which issued national bank notes.\nSatsuma Rebellion and aftermath (1877\u20131887).\nMassive inflation from the Satsuma Rebellion in 1877 caused a glut of non-redeemable fiat currency notes. The issuance of national fiat banknotes was ultimately suspended in 1880 by then prime minister Matsukata Masayoshi. New policies were put into place which included the establishment of a centralized banking system. \nThe Bank of Japan hence commenced operations on October 10, 1882, with the authority to print banknotes that could be exchanged for the old Government and National Bank Notes. By May 1883, another act provided the redemption and retirement of national bank notes. The \"National Bank Act\" was amended again in March 1896, providing for the dissolution of the national banks on the expiration of their charters. This amendment also prohibited national bank notes from circulating after December 31, 1899. In that year, Japan adopted a gold exchange standard, defining the yen as 0.75 g fine gold or US$0.4985.\nThis exchange rate remained in place until Japan left the gold standard in December 1931, after which the yen fell to $0.30 by July 1932 and to $0.20 by 1933.\nIt remained steady at around $0.30 until the start of the Pacific War on December 7, 1941, at which time it fell to $0.23.\nThe sen and the rin were eventually taken out of circulation at the end of 1953.\nFixed rate of the yen to the U.S. dollar.\nNo true exchange rate existed for the yen between December 7, 1941, and April 25, 1949; wartime inflation reduced the yen to a fraction of its prewar value.\nAfter a period of instability, on April 25, 1949, the U.S. occupation government fixed the value of the yen at \u00a5360 per USD through a United States plan, which was part of the Bretton Woods system, to stabilize prices in the Japanese economy.\nThat exchange rate was maintained until 1971, when the United States abandoned the gold standard, ending a key element of the Bretton Woods system, and setting in motion changes that eventually led to floating exchange rates in 1973.\nYen and major currencies float.\nBy 1971, the yen had become undervalued. Japanese exports were costing too little in international markets, and imports from abroad were costing the Japanese too much. This undervaluation was reflected in the current account balance, which had risen from the deficits of the early 1960s, to a then-large surplus of US$5.8\u00a0billion in 1971. The belief that the yen, and several other major currencies, were undervalued motivated the United States' actions in 1971.\nFollowing the United States' measures to devalue the dollar in the summer of 1971, the Japanese government agreed to a new, fixed exchange rate as part of the Smithsonian Agreement, signed at the end of the year. This agreement set the exchange rate at \u00a5308 per US$. However, the new fixed rates of the Smithsonian Agreement were difficult to maintain in the face of supply and demand pressures in the foreign-exchange market. In early 1973, the rates were abandoned, and the major nations of the world allowed their currencies to float.\nYen adoption in Okinawa.\nAfter World War II the United States-administered Okinawa issued a higher-valued currency called the B yen from 1946 to 1958, which was then replaced by the U.S. dollar at the rate of $1 = 120 B yen. Upon the reversion of Okinawa to Japan in 1972 the Japanese yen then replaced the dollar. In light of the dollar's reduction in value from \u00a5360 to \u00a5308 just before the reversion, an unannounced \"currency confirmation\" took place on October 9, 1971, wherein residents disclosed their dollar holdings in cash and bank accounts; dollars held that day amounting to US$60 million were entitled for conversion in 1972 at a higher rate of \u00a5360.\nJapanese government intervention in the currency market.\nIn the 1970s, Japanese government and business people were very concerned that a rise in the value of the yen would hurt export growth by making Japanese products less competitive and would damage the industrial base. The government, therefore, continued to intervene heavily in foreign-exchange marketing (buying or selling dollars), even after the 1973 decision to allow the yen to float.\nDespite intervention, market pressures caused the yen to continue climbing in value, peaking temporarily at an average of \u00a5271 per US$ in 1973, before the impact of the 1973 oil crisis was felt (this was retroactively called endaka, although the term was only coined in 1985). The increased costs of imported oil caused the yen to depreciate to a range of \u00a5290 per US$ to \u00a5300 per US$ between 1974 and 1976. The re-emergence of trade surpluses drove the yen back up to \u00a5211 in 1978. This currency strengthening was again reversed by the second oil shock in 1979, with the yen dropping to \u00a5227 per US$ by 1980.\nYen in the early 1980s.\nDuring the first half of the 1980s, the yen failed to rise in value, though current account surpluses returned and grew quickly. From \u00a5221 per US$ in 1981, the average value of the yen actually dropped to \u00a5239 per US$ in 1985. The rise in the current account surplus generated stronger demand for yen in foreign-exchange markets, but this trade-related demand for yen was offset by other factors. A wide differential in interest rates, with United States interest rates much higher than those in Japan, and the continuing moves to deregulate the international flow of capital, led to a large net outflow of capital from Japan. This capital flow increased the supply of yen in foreign-exchange markets, as Japanese investors changed their yen for other currencies (mainly dollars) to invest overseas. This kept the yen weak relative to the dollar and fostered the rapid rise in the Japanese trade surplus that took place in the 1980s.\nEffect of the Plaza Accord.\nIn 1985, a dramatic change began. Finance officials from major nations signed an agreement (the Plaza Accord) affirming that the dollar was overvalued (and, therefore, the yen undervalued). This agreement, and shifting supply and demand pressures in the markets, led to a rapid rise in the value of the yen. From its average of \u00a5239 per US$ in 1985, the yen rose to a peak of \u00a5128 in 1988, virtually doubling its value relative to the dollar. After declining somewhat in 1989 and 1990, it reached a new high of \u00a5123 to US$ in December 1992. In April 1995, the yen hit a peak of under 80 yen/US$, temporarily making Japan's economy nearly the size of that of the US.\nPost-bubble years.\nThe yen declined during the Japanese asset price bubble and continued to do so afterwards, reaching a low of \u00a5134 to US$ in February 2002. The Bank of Japan's policy of zero interest rates has discouraged yen investments, with the carry trade of investors borrowing yen and investing in better-paying currencies (thus further pushing down the yen) estimated to be as large as $1 trillion. In February 2007, \"The Economist\" estimated that the yen was 15% undervalued against the dollar, and as much as 40% undervalued against the euro.\nAfter the global economic crisis of 2008.\nHowever, this trend of depreciation reversed after the global economic crisis of 2008. Other major currencies, except the Swiss franc, have been declining relative to the yen.\nOn April 4, 2013, the Bank of Japan announced that they would expand their asset purchase program by $1.4\u00a0trillion in two years. The Bank of Japan hopes to bring Japan from deflation to inflation, aiming for 2% inflation. The number of purchases is so large that it is expected to double the money supply, but this move has sparked concerns that the authorities in Japan are deliberately devaluing the yen to boost exports. However, the commercial sector in Japan worried that the devaluation would trigger an increase in import prices, especially for energy and raw materials.\nA period of rapid global inflation from 2022 onwards.\nSince 2022, the yen has depreciated significantly against its peers, due to a variety of factors. Firstly, Japan's prolonged low-interest-rate policy (to tackle domestic deflation) has created a yield differential with other countries\u2014notably the US\u2014that have high interest rates (to tackle domestic inflation), prompting investors to seek higher returns in foreign currencies. This interest rate differential directly affects the price of the Yen and serves as one of the drivers behind its depreciation. Widely held expectations of yen depreciation can become self-fulfilling prophecies, affecting the currency's exchange rate. To counter this, the BOJ conducted currency interventions of more than JPY 9 trillion selling the dollar and buying the yen in the September\u2013October 2022 and April\u2013May 2024 periods respectively.\nRedenomination proposals.\nNumerous proposals have been made since the 1990s to redenominate the yen by introducing a new unit or new yen, equal to 100 yen, and nearly worth one U.S. dollar. This has not happened to date, since the yen remains trusted globally despite its low unit value, and due to the huge costs of reissuing new currency and updating currency-reading hardware. The negative impact of postponing upgrades to various computer software until redenomination occurs, in particular, was also cited.\nCoins.\nThe Japan Mint has issued legal tender coins from 1871 to the present.\nCirculating coinage.\nThe obverse side of all coins shows the coin's value in kanji characters as well as the country name (through 1945, ; after 1945, (except for the 5-yen coin with the country name on the reverse). The reverse side of all coins shows the year of mintage, which is not shown in Gregorian calendar years, but instead in the regnal year of the reigning emperor, with the first year of an era called . Imperial portraits have never appeared on Japanese coins, as the image of the emperor remains sacred. The regnal year does not necessarily align with the calendar year. The first coins of the Reiwa era were minted in July 2019.\nIn 1897, the silver 1 yen coin was demonetized and the sizes of the gold coins were reduced by 50%, with 5, 10 and 20 yen coins issued.\nAfter the war, brass 50 sen, 1 and 5 yen were introduced between 1946 and 1948. The existing-type holed brass 5 yen was introduced in 1949, the bronze 10 yen in 1951, and the aluminum 1 yen in 1955.\nIn 1955 the first unholed, nickel 50 yen was introduced. In 1957, silver 100 yen pieces were introduced, followed by the holed 50 yen coin in 1959. These were replaced in 1967 by the existing cupro-nickel 100 yen along with a smaller 50 yen.\nIn 1982, the first cupronickel 500 yen coin was introduced. Alongside the 5 Swiss franc coin, the 500 yen coin is one of the highest-valued coin to be used regularly in the world, with a value of US$4.42 as of \u00a02016[ [update]]. Because of its high face value, the 500 yen coin has been a favorite target for counterfeiters, resulting in the issuance in 2000 of the second nickel-brass 500 yen coin with added security features. Continued counterfeiting of the latter resulted in the issuance in 2021 of the third bi-metallic 500 yen coin with more improvements in security features.\nDue to the great differences in style, size, weight and the pattern present on the edge of the coin they are easy for people with visual impairments to tell apart from one another.\nCommemorative coins have been minted on various occasions in base metal, silver and gold. The first of these were silver \u00a5100 and \u00a51,000 Summer Olympic coins issued for the 1964 games. The largest issuance by denomination and total face value were 10 million gold coins of for the 60th anniversary of reign of the Sh\u014dwa Emperor in 1986, totalling \u00a51 trillion and utilizing 200,000\u00a0kg fine gold. \u00a5500 commemorative coins have been regularly issued since 1985. In 2008 commemorative \u00a5500 and \u00a51,000 coins were issued featuring Japan's 47 prefectures. Even though all commemorative coins can be spent like ordinary (non-commemorative) coins, they do not normally circulate, and \u00a5100,000 coins are treated with caution due to the discovery of counterfeits.\nThe 1 yen coin is made out of 100% aluminum and can float on water if placed correctly.\nFormerly circulated coinage.\nSen.\nSubsidiary coins of \"sen\" (one hundredth of a yen) were initially introduced in 1870 with a silver alloy in denominations of 5, 10, 20 and 50 sen. Copper sen coins in denominations of half, 1, and 2 came three years later, as Japan acquired the technology needed to mint them. The removal of silver from sen coinage began in 1889, when Cupronickel 5 sen coins were introduced. By 1920, this included cupro-nickel 10 sen and reduced-size silver 50 sen coins. Production of the latter ceased in 1938, after which a variety of base metals were used to produce 1, 5 and 10 sen coins during the Second World War. While clay 5 and 10 sen coins were produced in 1945, they were not issued for circulation. As with the Rin, coins in denominations of less than 1 yen became invalid at the end of 1953 and were demonetized due to inflation.\nRin.\nBronze coins worth one-one thousandth of a yen called \"rin\" were first introduced in 1873. One rin coins were very small, measuring 15.75\u00a0mm in diameter and 0.3\u00a0mm in thickness, and co-circulated with mon coins of the old currency system. Their small size was eventually their undoing, and the rin was abandoned in 1884 due to unpopularity. Five rin coins worth one-two hundredth of a yen also used a bronze alloy. These were successor coins to the equally valued half sen coin which had been previously minted until 1888. The decision to bring back an equally valued coin was in response to rising inflation caused by World War I which led to an overall shortage of subsidiary coins. The mintage period for five rin coins was brief as they were discontinued after only four years of production due to their sharp decline in monetary value. The overall demand for subsidiary coinage ended as Japan slipped into a post-war recession. Coins worth 1 and 5 rin were eventually officially taken out of circulation at the end of 1953 and demonetized.\nBanknotes.\nThe issuance of yen banknotes began in 1872, two years after the currency was introduced. Denominations have ranged from 1 yen to 10,000 yen; since 1984, the lowest-valued banknote is the 1,000 yen note. Before and during World War II, various bodies issued banknotes in yen, such as the Ministry of Finance and the Imperial Japanese National Bank. The Allied forces also issued some notes shortly after the war. Since then, the Bank of Japan has been the exclusive note issuing authority. The bank has issued five series after World War II.\nJapan is generally considered a cash-based society, with 38% of payments in Japan made by cash in 2014. Possible explanations are that cash payments protect one's privacy, merchants do not have to wait for payment, and it does not carry any negative connotation like credit.\nAt present, portraits of people from the Meiji period and later are printed on Japanese banknotes. The reason for this is that from the viewpoint of preventing forgery, it is desirable to use a precise photograph as an original rather than a painting for a portrait.\nSeries E banknotes were introduced in 2004 in \u00a51000, \u00a55000, and \u00a510,000 denominations.\nSeries F banknotes were introduced on 3 July 2024. They were announced on 9 April 2019 by Finance Minister Tar\u014d As\u014d. The \u00a51000 bill features Kitasato Shibasabur\u014d and \"The Great Wave off Kanagawa\", the \u00a55000 bill features Tsuda Umeko and Wisteria flowers, and the \u00a510,000 bill features Shibusawa Eiichi and Tokyo Station. The Ministry decided to not redesign the \u00a52000 note due to low circulation.\nThe EURion constellation pattern is present in the Series D, E and F banknotes.\nDeterminants of value.\nBeginning in December 1931, Japan gradually shifted from the gold standard system to the managed currency system.\nThe relative value of the yen is determined in foreign exchange markets by the economic forces of supply and demand. The supply of the yen in the market is governed by the desire of yen holders to exchange their yen for other currencies to purchase goods, services, or assets. The demand for the yen is governed by the desire of foreigners to buy goods and services in Japan and by their interest in investing in Japan (buying yen-denominated real and financial assets).\nSince the 1990s, the Bank of Japan, the country's central bank, has kept interest rates low to spur economic growth. Short-term lending rates have responded to this monetary relaxation and fell from 3.7% to 1.3% between 1993 and 2008. Low interest rates and low inflation, combined with a ready liquidity, prompted investors to borrow yen in Japan and invest it in other countries (such as the US) with significantly higher bank rates, a practice known as the carry trade. This has helped to keep the exchange rate of the yen low compared to other currencies, particularly the US dollar.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Static row numbers/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\nInternational reserve currency.\nThe special drawing rights (SDR) valuation is an IMF basket of the world's major reserve currencies, including the Japanese yen. Its share of 8.33% as of 2016 has declined from 18% as of 2000.\nThe percental composition of currencies of official foreign exchange reserves from 1995 to 2024.\nHistorical exchange rate.\nBefore the war commenced, the yen traded on an average of 3.6 yen to the dollar. After the war the yen went as low as 600 yen per USD in 1947, as a result of currency overprinting in order to fund the war, and afterwards to fund the reconstruction.\nWhen MacArthur and the US forces entered Japan in 1945, they decreed an official conversion rate of 15 yen to the USD. Within 1945\u20131946: the rate tanked to 50 yen to the USD because of the ongoing inflation. During the first half of 1946, the rate fluctuated to 66 yen to the USD and eventually plummeting to 600 yen to the dollar by 1947 because of the failure of the economic remedies. Eventually, the peg was officially moved to 270 yen to the dollar in 1948 before being adjusted again from 1949 to 1971 to 360 yen to the dollar.\nBeginning in 2022 the yen/dollar rate has become increasingly weaker with each passing month. By July 2024, the price fell to upper \u00a5161 per $1, marking the lowest exchange rate for the yen in 37.5 years on a nominal effective exchange rate and the lowest real effective exchange rate since the start of statistics by the Bank of Japan in 1970. One of the main reasons behind this fall was the US moving towards higher interest rates, while Japan remained \"ultra-low\". Other factors include the strength of the US economy and its labor market, while Japan continues to lag behind its peers to bring its economy back to its pre-pandemic size. Japan's trade balance staying in the red is also likely feeding into the weaker yen. Interviewed by The Asahi Shimbun in September 2022, Izuru Kato, chief economist at Totan Research, expressed concern about the sharp fall in its value since 2022. and Moneypost reported that the exchange rate instability had made it impossible to exchange the currency for Japanese yen at some exchange offices. With the rate returning to \u00a5150 in November 2023, concern deepened as Nikkei sources expected the yen to depreciate further in the future. \"The Economist\" (London) expressed concern over the performance of the Bank of Japan, suggested that a systemic risk is posed to the world financial system. Other reports of a weakening of the Japanese yen include the Noto Peninsula earthquake in January 2024, where previous earthquakes had seen a temporary appreciation of the yen against the US dollar, but this earthquake reversed the trend and weakened the yen against the US dollar.\nGoldman Sachs expects the Japanese yen to remain very weak in the coming months.\nAverage spot rates v USD.\nThe table below shows the monthly average of the U.S. dollar\u2013yen spot rate (JPY per USD) at 17:00 JST:\nAverage monthly real effective exchange rate.\nThe table below shows monthly averages of real effective exchange rates.

{"id": "34393", "revid": "7098284", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34393", "title": "Yule log", "text": "Log burnt on a hearth as a Christmas tradition\nThe Yule log is a specially selected log burnt on a hearth as a winter tradition in regions of Europe, and subsequently North America. Today, this tradition is celebrated by Christians and modern pagans on or around Christmas or Yule. The name by which this tradition goes, as well as when and how the Yule log should be burnt, varies widely with time and place. The first solid evidence for this tradition originates in 1184 CE as a Christmas eve tradition. The practice was originally known as the \"Christmas log\" (and still is in languages other than English), with \"Yule log\" first used in the late 17th century. The origins of the Yule log are unclear, with scholars proposing a variety of possible theories ranging from a medieval Christmas tradition, a surviving ritual from Albanian, Roman, Celtic, Germanic, Baltic or Slavic paganism, or as a Proto-Indo-European ritual that has survived in a variety of cultures until today. \nFolklorist Linda Watts provides the following overview of the English Yule log custom:The Christmas practice calls for burning a portion of the log each evening until Twelfth Night (January 6). The log is subsequently placed beneath the bed for luck, and particularly for protection from the household threats of lightning and, with some irony, fire. Many have beliefs based on the Yule log as it burns, and by counting the sparks and such, they seek to discern their fortunes for the new year and beyond.\nOrigins.\nThe first evidence in English for a special log burned around Christmas comes from Robert Herrick's poetry collection of 1648, where it is called a \"Christmas log\". Herrick recounts how cheering lads brought the Christmas log into the farmhouse, are then rewarded with alcohol for their efforts, and how the log was believed to bring prosperity. The first mention of the name Yule log occurs between 1650 and 1687 in John Aubrey's writings on Christmas pastimes when he mentions \"a large Yule log or Christmas block\". Beginning in the 18th century, it began to be theorized that the custom may have much earlier origins, extending from customs observed in Germanic paganism. Starting in 1725, Henry Bourne was the first to link the Yule log in Anglo-Saxon paganism:Our Fore-Fathers, when the common Devices of \"Eve\" were over, and Night was come on, were wont to light up \"Candles\" of an uncommon Size, which were called \"Christmas-Candles\", and to lay a \"Log\" of Wood upon the Fire, which they termed a \"Yule-Clog\", or \"Christmas-Block\". These were to Illuminate the House, and turn the Night into Day; which custom, in some Measure, is still kept up in the Northern Parts. It hath, in all probability, been derived from the \"Saxons\". For \"Bede\" tells us, That [\"sic\"] this very Night was observed in this Land before, by the \"Heathen Saxons\". They began, says he, their Year on the Eight of the Calenders of \"January\", which is now our \"Christmas Party\": And the very Night before, which is now Holy to us, was by them called \"M\u00e6drenack\", or the \"Night of the Mothers\" \u2026 The \"Yule-Clog\" therefore hath probably been a Part of those Ceremonies which were perform'd that Night's Ceremonies. It seems to have been used, as an Emblem of the return of the \"Sun\", and the lengthening of the Days. For as both \"December\" and \"January\" were called \"Guili\" or \"Yule\", upon Account of the Sun's Returning, and the Increase of the Days; so, I am apt to believe, the Log has had the Name of the \"Yule-Log\", from its being burnt as an Emblem of the returning Sun, and the Increase of its Light and Heat. This was probably the Reason of the custom among the \"Heathen Saxons\"; but I cannot think the Observation of it was continued for the same Reason, after Christianity was embraced. \u2026\"Since Bourne introduced his theory, there has been significant scholarly debate about whether the connection between the pagan festival of Yule and the Yule log extends beyond the linguistic use of \"Yule\" as a synonym for Christmas. One of the reasons is that little can be said for certain about the practices of the original Yule celebration. Our most complete descriptions of the customs around the celebration of the festival of Yule come from the Icelandic saga writer Snorri Sturluson. Snorri Sturluson was a 13th century Christian writer, writing more than two centuries after the Christian conversion of Iceland, and was writing for a Christian audience. The degree to which Snorri and other saga writers were aware of the customs of Yule, and the degree to which they cared to accurately represent them in their writings, is currently unknown. In addition, the sagas, our only ancient or medieval sources that mention fire in relation to ancient Yule celebrations, only mention fire when talking about the large fires traditionally found in the center of feasting halls/temples, which were also use year round for heating/cooking. The sagas do not mention any special importance placed of the log's themselves that are being burnt. \nThe first mention of a special Christmas log comes from a German manuscript of legal obligations written in 1184 CE where it records that the manse of Ahlen is entitled to a whole tree for a private festive fire on Christmas eve. Another early reference can be found in the text \"Liber statutorum civitatis Ragusii compositus anno,\" which was written in Dubrovnik in 1272 CE. It records that shipmasters and the sailors brought the count of the city a large log on Christmas eve and place it on the fire, for which they are given as reward two gold coins and alcohol. It is important to note that in Europe during the high to late medieval period and early modern period, lumber and firewood could not be freely collected as nearly all forests and trees were privately owned, mostly by royals, nobles and the church. For a person to get access to the lumber in the forests that they did not own, they had to either buy it or be given rights to a certain amount of wood through a legal charter. Landowners often had contracts with their tenants that laid out exactly how much wood could be collected from the forest for their use for firewood, tools, and building materials, as well as the penalties if they were caught taking more. Stories and legal charters from the 13th/14th century illustrate that it was not uncommon for peasants to be without enough firewood for anything beyond a very small cooking fire on Christmas. In medieval Europe, the burning of a large log on Christmas eve may have been a way to celebrate the end to the period of fasting and contemplation that lasted from the start of advent through Christmas eve, and to celebrate the coming public and private feasts and celebrations on Christmas day. The earliest textual evidence specifically mentioning large public Christmas fires occurs in 1577 and 1591, both occurring in legal charters from Germany. The first mention in 1577 is about how the monastery will be obligated to provide firewood to a tenant, and as well as a large special log on Christmas, on condition that the tenant allow the public to warm themselves by the fire. The second mention in 1591, says that the mayor is obliged to keep a large fire lit near the church on Christmas morning, so that any who are coming to matins and church may warm themselves. \nIt is not until John Aubrey's writing in the 17th century that any source mentions that the Yule log may offer some supernatural benefit (Aubrey mention the Christmas log bringing prosperity). It is then not until John Aubrey, writing in the mid 17th century nearly five centuries after the first mention of a large log meant to be burnt on Christmas eve, that the holiday of Yule was first associate with the practice when Aubrey mentioned that some in England also call this practice the Yule log.\nMartin of Braga, Bishop of Braga, writing in 6th century, may have made the first mention of a tradition similar to the yule log in his work, \"De correctione rusticorum\". In a section of his letter, he lists a variety of pagan practices that were still being performed by Christians in the 6th century and that he considered to be devil worship. One section of the list can be translated as \"To take notice of the Volcanes and of the Calends, to garnish to tables, to lay laurel, to enter with the right foot, to pour grain and wine over a log in the hearth, and to throw bread into the fountains, what is this if not Devil worship? \" Based on this translation, some scholars suggest that he is describing a ritual associated with the Kalends of January that would then go on to become the Yule log. The scholar Jacob Latham has suggested that in late antiquity the Kalends of January was no longer solely a pagan holiday but had been reinvented as a holiday that openly fused together Christian and pagan traditions and symbolism. All of the countries with the earliest accounts of the Yule log also were once part of the Roman empire. The practice described in the passage also resembles Yule log traditions in several countries where wine is poured over the log, such as France, Italy, Spain, and Montenegro. The passage also resembles a description of the Yule log found in writing from the court of the duke of Milan between 1466-1476 CE. It was recorded that on Christmas eve, a log, covered in fruits and foliage, especially juniper and laurel, was brought into the court at sunset, and was burned in the hearth for the enjoyment of all. Bishop Pirmin, in his book \"Dicta Abbatis Pirminii, de Singulis Libris Canonicis Scarapsus,\" which was written between 710-724 CE, quotes Martin of Braga when he is attempting to correct Christians who are still practicing pagan rituals. Notably, his quote leaves out any mention of the hearth or fire, only mentioning pouring fruit and wine over a stump. Yule log traditions in some parts of Croatia and Italy involve no fire or hearth, resembling Bishop Pirmin's fireless description as well. In a letter from Bonifacius to Pope Zacharius. written between 741-752 CE, there is a section where Bonifacius laments that Christians in Rome were still celebrating the Kalends of January in the pagan manner. Among a larger list of pagan activities, it is mentioned that the celebrants were not willing to lend fire, iron, or any convenience to their neighbor from their house. Scholar Alexander Tille interprets this reluctant to lend out fire as further evidence of there being a tradition of having private fires in the home on the Kalends of January.\nDiffusion and modern practices.\nThe Yule log is recorded in the folklore archives of much of England, but particularly in collections covering the West Country and the North Country. For example, in his section regarding \"Christmas Observances\", J. B. Partridge recorded then-current (1914) Christmas customs in Yorkshire, Britain involving the Yule log as related by \"Mrs. Day, Minchinhampton (Gloucestershire), a native of Swaledale\". The custom is as follows:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nH. J. Rose records a similar folk belief from Killinghall, Yorkshire in 1923: \"In the last generation the Yule log was still burned, and a piece of it saved to light the next year's log. On Christmas morning something green, a leaf or the like, was brought into the house before anything was taken out.\"\nThe Yule log is also attested as a custom present elsewhere in the English-speaking world, such as the United States. Robert Meyer, Jr. records in 1947 that a \"Yule-Log Ceremony\" in Palmer Lake, Colorado had occurred since 1934. He describes the custom: \"It starts with the yule log [\"sic\"] hunt and is climaxed by drinking of wassail around the fire.\" In the Southern United States before the end of the American Civil War, the Yule log was also maintained as a tradition. For example, according to scholar Allen Cabaniss:\nFor slaves, Christmas had special meaning. December was a slow work month on the typical plantation, and it became the social season for them. The slaves' holiday lasted until the Yule log burned, which sometimes took over a week.\nRegional variations and analogues.\nAlbania.\nNata e Buzmit, \"Yule log's night\", is traditionally celebrated by Albanians between December 22 and January 6. Buzmi is a ritualistic piece of wood (or several pieces of wood) that is put to burn in the fire (zjarri) of the hearth (vat\u00ebr) on the night of a winter celebration that falls after the return of the Sun (Dielli) for summer (after the winter solstice), sometimes on the night of \"K\u00ebrsh\u00ebndella\" on December 24 (Christmas Eve), sometimes on the night of \"kolendra\", or sometimes on New Year's Day or on any other occasion around the same period, a tradition that is originally related to the cult of the Sun.\nA series of rituals of a magical character are performed with the buzmi, which, based on old beliefs, aims at agricultural plant growth and for the prosperity of production in the living thing (production of vegetables, trees, vineyards, etc.). This practice has been traditionally found among all Albanians, also documented among the Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb in Italy and the Arvanites in Greece until the first half of the 20th century, and it is still preserved in remote Albanian ethnographic regions today.\nThe richest set of rites related to buzmi are found in northern Albania (Mirdita, Puk\u00eb, Dukagjin, Mal\u00ebsia e Madhe, Shkod\u00ebr and Lezh\u00eb, as well as in Kosovo, Dib\u00ebr and so on.\nUnited Kingdom.\nScholars have observed similarities between the Yule log and the folk custom of the ashen faggot, recorded solely in the West Country of England. First recorded at the beginning of the 19th century, the ashen faggot is burnt on Christmas Eve, is associated with a variety of folk beliefs, and is \"made of smaller ash sticks bound into a faggot with strips of hazel, withy, or bramble\". G. R. Wiley observes that the ashen faggot may have developed out of the Yule log.\nThe term \"Yule log\" is not the only term used to refer to the custom. It was commonly called a \"Yule Clog\" in north-east England, and it was also called the \"Yule Block\" in the Midlands and West Country and \"Gule Block\" in Lincolnshire. In Cornwall, the term \"Stock of the Mock\" was found. In Wales it's called \"Boncyff Nadolig\" or \"Blocyn y Gwyliau\" (the Christmas Log or the Festival Block). In Scotland it's called \"Yeel Carline\" (the Christmas Old Wife).\nIreland.\nIn Ireland, the yule log is called \"Bloc na Nollag\" (the Christmas Block).\nGermany.\nIn Germany, where it\u2019s called \"Christklotz, Christbrand, Christblock, Julklotz\" or \"Julblock\" it was customary, especially in Hesse and Westphalia, to burn the log slowly and then remove it and throw it back on the fire as protection from lightning.\nFrance.\nThe custom of burning a Yule log for one or more nights starting on Christmas Eve was also formerly widespread in France, where the usual term is \"b\u00fbche de no\u00ebl\". This may derive from a custom requiring peasants to bring a log to their lord. In Burgundy, gifts would be hidden under the log. Prayers were offered as the log was lighted in Brittany and in Provence, where the custom is still widely observed and called \"cacho fio\" (blessing of the log): the log, or branch from a fruit-bearing tree, is first paraded three times around the house by the grandfather of the family, then blessed with wine; it is often lighted together with the saved ashes of the previous year's log. Other regional names include \"cosse de Nau\" in Berry, \"mouchon de Nau\" in Angoumois, \"chuquet\" in Normandy, \"souche\" in the \u00cele de France, and \"tr\u00e9fouiau\" in the Vend\u00e9e. The custom has now long been replaced by the eating of a log-shaped cake, also named \"B\u00fbche de No\u00ebl\".\nPortugal.\nIn Portugal, the \"Madeiros de Natal\" are big bonfires that are lit in the center of the village, in the main square or in the churchyard on Christmas Eve. \nThe remains of the log were preserved as they were believed to prevent damage usually caused by storms.\nSpain.\nIn Galicia, the Galicians also have their local variant of this tradition known as \"tiz\u00f3n de Nadal\" or \"cepo de Nadal\". \nIn Asturias the \"Nataliegu\" burns from December 24 until the new year in the fireplace of many houses and leaves sweet buns for the children. Then his ashes, which were attributed healing and protective powers for the home, were scattered around the house, the stables and other rooms. \nIn High Aragon it is called \"tiz\u00f3n de Nadal.\" The children of the house are in charge of saying beautiful phrases, blessings and rituals (although in some places the blessing is done by the oldest or owner of the house). Sometimes the blessing is done after filling the log with a little wine while the blessing is said. \nCatalan People have a similar tradition, where \"Ti\u00f3 de Nadal\" is a magic log \"fed\" before Christmas. Singing children cover the \"ti\u00f3\" with a blanket and beat him with sticks to make the \"ti\u00f3\" defecate nougat candy and small gifts. In the eastern areas in contact with Catalonia, the ritual has a more playful part, when the children of the house hit the log so it \"shits\" the presents, which are usually jellies, candies, nuts and other things to eat or play. \nPyrenean Europe.\nIn Basque Country, \"Subilaro-egur also\" burns until the end of the year. The log gives life to good wishes, burns curses, prevents diseases and ensures good harvests. Alternate names include \"eguberri, gabon, gabonzuzi, gabon-subil, gabon-mukur, olentzero-enbor, onontzoro-mokor, suklaro-egur, sukubela\" or \"porrondoko\". Olentzero is a modern personification of the old log. \nIn Occitania the \u201ccachafu\u00f2c\u201d or \u201csoc de Nadal\u201d it's also one of the traditional elements that accompany and cheer up Christmas. \nItaly.\nChristmas in Italy begins on 8 December with the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, the day on which traditionally Christmas trees are erected, and ends on 6 January of the following year with Epiphany.\nThe tradition of the Yule log, once widespread, has been attested in Italy since the 15th century. The Yule log appears with different names depending on the region: in Tuscany it is known as \"ciocco\", while in Lombardy it is known as \"zocco\". In Lombardy, the head of the family used to sprinkle juniper on the stump and place coins on it while reciting a prayer in the name of the Trinity. \u00a0Afterwards, people drank as much as they liked and the remaining wine was thrown by the head of the family on the log. It was also customary, during the log ceremony, to cut three panettone and keep a piece for thaumaturgical purposes for the whole of the following year\nIn Tuscany, in particular in Val di Chiana (province of Arezzo), it was customary to chant the following prayer during the Christmas log ceremony. Later, blindfolded children (rewarded with sweets and other gifts), had to hit the log with pincers, while the rest of the family sang a particular song, called \"Ave Maria del Ceppo\". \nIn eastern Sicily, especially in the Etna areas, the Christmas log (Zuccu in dialect) is customary to stack wood in a pyramidal way in the squares of the villages, tradition has it that it is lit on the evening of the 24th before the midnight mass after the blessing of the priest. In addition to recalling the Christian symbolism of the \"light source of life\", it becomes a pleasant opportunity, after the celebration of the midnight vigil, to stop around the log and exchange Christmas greetings wrapped in the heat of the flames.In Val di Chiana, in Tuscany, it was customary for children, blindfolded, to hit the block with pincers, while the rest of the family sang the \"Ave Maria del Ceppo\". That tradition was once deeply rooted in Italy is demonstrated by the fact that Christmas in Tuscany was called the \"feast of the log\".\nMontenegro.\nIn Montenegro, it was customary to put a piece of bread on the log and (similar to the Lombard custom) sprinkle it with wine. \nBaltics.\nBaltic people also have a similar ritual called \"log pulling\" (; ) where people in a village would drag a log (; ) or a tree stump through the village at the winter solstice and then at the end burn it.\nBalkans.\nSerbian people have a similar tradition in which oak is burned.\nAs early as Jacob Grimm in the early 19th century, scholars have observed parallels between the South Slavic custom of the Badnjak and the Yule log tradition. As observed by M. E. Durham (1940), the Badnjak is a sapling that is placed on the hearth on Christmas Eve. Varying customs involving the Badnjak may be performed, such as smearing it with fowl blood or goat blood and the ashes may be \"strewn on the fields or garden to promote fertility on New Year's Eve\".\nGreece.\nIn Greece, the yule log was believed to drive away the kallikantzaroi, the evil monsters of local folklore, from one's home.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, a local New York television station first broadcast a six-minute loop of a yule log burning in a fireplace over the course of several hours. The broadcast, called simply \"Yule Log\", premiered in full color on Dec. 24, 1966, at 9:30\u00a0p.m. on WPIX (Channel 11 in New York City) and became a yearly tradition. The original \"Yule Log\" footage was filmed on 16 millimeter film at Gracie Mansion, New York City's mayoral residence. New footage of a flaming yule log was shot in 1970, in a different location, producing a seven-minute loop on 35 millimeter film. The station still broadcasts the \"Yule Log\" for four to five hours every Christmas morning and, through the years, has had many imitators at television stations across the country. In 2024, Roku, Inc. launched a 24-hour Yule log FAST channel on their streaming players through The Roku Channel.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of the 2014 census, Yamoussoukro is the fifth most populous city in the Ivory Coast, with a population of 212,670. Located north-west of Abidjan, the district of Yamoussoukro covers among rolling hills and plains.\nYamoussoukro became the legal capital of Ivory Coast in 1983, although the former capital Abidjan retains several political functions. Prior to 2011, what is now the district of Yamoussoukro was part of Lacs Region. The district was created in 2011 and is split into the departments of Atti\u00e9gouakro and Yamoussoukro. In total, the district contains 169 settlements. Yamoussoukro is a sub-prefecture in Yamoussoukro Department and is also a commune: since 2012, the city of Yamoussoukro has been the sole commune in the autonomous district of Yamoussoukro.\nHistory.\nPrehistory.\nStone tools found in the country from hundreds of thousands of years ago show that the area around Yamoussoukro has been occupied since ancient times. Due to the desertification of the Sahara, many moved south to avoid the harsh conditions.\nColonial period.\nQueen Yamoussou, the niece of Kouassi N'Go, ran the city of \"N'Gokro\" in 1929 at the time of French colonization. The village of N'Gokro was renamed Yamoussoukro, the suffix \"Kro\" meaning town in Baoule.\nDiplomatic and commercial relations were then established, but in 1909, on the orders of the Chief of Djamlabo, the Akou\u00e9 revolted against the administration. Bonzi station, from Yamoussoukro on the Bouafl\u00e9 road, was set on fire, and the French administrator, Simon Maurice, was spared only by the intervention of Kouassi N'Go.\nAs the situation got worse, Maurice, judging that Bonzi had become safe, decided to transfer the French military station to Yamoussoukro, where the French Administration built a pyramid to the memory of Kouassi N'Go, Chief of the Akou\u00e9, who was assassinated in 1910 by Akou\u00e9 rebels, accusing him of being too close to the French.\nIn 1919, the civil station of Yamoussoukro was removed. F\u00e9lix Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny became the leader of the village in 1939. A long period passed wherein Yamoussoukro, still a small agricultural town, remained in the shadows. This continued until after the Second World War, which saw the creation of the African Agricultural Union, as well as the first conferences of its chief. However, it was only with independence that Yamoussoukro finally started to rise.\nIn 1950, the village comprised 500 inhabitants.\nSince independence.\nAfter 1964, the President F\u00e9lix Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny made ambitious plans and started to build. One day in 1965, later called the Great Lesson of Yamoussoukro, he visited the plantations with the leaders of the county, inviting them to transpose to their own villages the efforts and agricultural achievements of the region. On 21 July 1977, Houphou\u00ebt offered his plantations to the State.\nIn March 1983, President Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny made Yamoussoukro the political and administrative capital of Ivory Coast, as the city was his birthplace. This marked the fourth movement of the country's capital city in a century. Ivory Coast's previous capital cities were Grand-Bassam (1893), Bingerville (1900), and Abidjan (1933). Most economic activity still takes place in Abidjan, and it is officially designated as the \"economic capital\" of the country.\nYamoussoukro is the seat of Yamoussoukro Department and the neighbouring B\u00e9lier Region, but Yamoussoukro itself is not part of the region.\nGovernance.\nBeginning in 2001, the city was governed as part of the Yamoussoukro Department and incorporated into Lacs Region. In 2011, the department was abolished and the autonomous district of Yamoussoukro was created and separated from the rest of Lacs, which became a separate district.\nUnlike most districts of the country, the autonomous district of Yamoussoukro is not subdivided into regions. The district, however, is divided into departments, sub-prefectures and a commune. The district consists of the departments of Atti\u00e9gouakro and Yamoussoukro. The departments further divided into the sub-prefectures of Atti\u00e9gouakro, Kossou, Lolobo, and Yamoussoukro. There is one commune, which is also named Yamoussoukro, and it shares the same borders as the district. In 2011, the position of Mayor of Yamoussoukro was replaced with a district governor appointed by the head of state.\nArchitecture.\nAlso noteworthy are the Kossou Dam, the PDCI-RDA House, the schools of the F\u00e9lix Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny National Polytechnic Institute, the Town Hall, the Protestant Temple, the Mosque, and the Palace of Hosts. The Yamoussoukro International Airport had an average of six hundred passengers and 36 flights in 1995. It is one of two airports in Africa (with Gbadolite) that could accommodate the Concorde.\nPlaces of worship.\nAmong the places of worship are predominantly Christian churches and temples: Roman Catholic Diocese of Yamoussoukro (Catholic Church), United Methodist Church Ivory Coast (World Methodist Council), Union of Missionary Baptist Churches in Ivory Coast (Baptist World Alliance), Assemblies of God. There are also Muslim mosques.\nYamoussoukro is the site of the largest Christian church in the world: The Basilica of Our Lady of Peace, consecrated by Pope John Paul II on 10 September 1990.\nTransport.\nThe city is served by Yamoussoukro International Airport.\nEconomy.\nThe main activities in the city are fishing, forestry, and perfume industries.\nClimate.\nYamoussoukro features a tropical wet and dry climate (Aw) under the K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate classification system. The city features a lengthy wet season covering the months of March through October, and a shorter dry season that covers the remaining four months. Like many other cities in West Africa, Yamoussoukro is affected by the harmattan, which serves as a primary source of the city's dry season. Despite the lengthy wet season, Yamoussoukro does not see the level of rainfall experienced in Abidjan. Yamoussoukro on average sees roughly of precipitation annually.\nEducation.\nThe Institut National Polytechnique F\u00e9lix Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny was founded in 1996.\nSport.\nThe city hosted the 2019 World Draughts Championship in draughts and is home to the Ivory Coast Open tennis tournament.\nThe city's two football teams SOA and ASC Ouragahio share the Yamoussoukro Stadium.\nFC Bibo play in the suburb of Kossou.\nSOA's basketball club plays in the top division.\nThe city was scheduled to host group stage games for the AFCON 2023, delayed due to weather conditions to January 2024.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "34398", "revid": "43066271", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34398", "title": "Zeus", "text": "Greek god of the sky and king of the gods\nZeus (, ) is the chief deity of the Greek pantheon. He is a sky and thunder god in ancient Greek religion and mythology, who rules as king of the gods on Mount Olympus.\nZeus is the child of Cronus and Rhea, the youngest of his siblings to be born, though sometimes reckoned the eldest as the others required disgorging from Cronus's stomach. In most traditions, he is married to Hera, by whom he is usually said to have fathered Ares, Eileithyia, Hebe, and Hephaestus. At the oracle of Dodona, his consort was said to be Dione, by whom the \"Iliad\" states that he fathered Aphrodite. According to the \"Theogony\", Zeus's first wife was Metis, by whom he had Athena. Zeus was also infamous for his erotic escapades. These resulted in many divine and heroic offspring, including Apollo, Artemis, Hermes, Persephone, Dionysus, Perseus, Heracles, Helen of Troy, Minos, and the Muses.\nHe was respected as a sky father who was chief of the gods and assigned roles to the others: \"Even the gods who are not his natural children address him as Father, and all the gods rise in his presence.\" He was equated with many foreign weather gods, permitting Pausanias to observe \"That Zeus is king in heaven is a saying common to all men\". Among his symbols are the thunderbolt and the eagle. In addition to his Indo-European inheritance, the classical \"cloud-gatherer\" (Greek: , ) also derives certain iconographic traits from the cultures of the ancient Near East, such as the scepter.\nName.\nThe god's name in the nominative is (\"Ze\u00fas\"). It is inflected as follows: vocative: (\"\"); accusative: (); genitive: (); dative: (). Diogenes La\u00ebrtius quotes Pherecydes of Syros as spelling the name . The earliest attested forms of the name are the Mycenaean Greek , \"di-we\" (dative) and , \"di-wo\" (genitive), written in the Linear B syllabic script.\n\"Zeus\" is the Greek continuation of \"*Dy\u0113us\" the name of the Proto-Indo-European god of the daytime sky, also called (\"Sky Father\"). The god is known under this name in the \"Rigveda\" (Vedic Sanskrit \"Dyaus/Dyaus Pita\"), Latin (compare \"Jupiter\", from \"Iuppiter\", deriving from the Proto-Indo-European vocative ), deriving from the root *\"dyeu\"- (\"to shine\", and in its many derivatives, \"sky, heaven, god\"). Albanian and Messapic are clear equivalents and cognates of \"Zeus\". In the Greek, Albanian, and Messapic forms the original cluster \"*di\u032f\" underwent affrication to \"*dz\". Zeus is the only deity in the Olympic pantheon whose name has such a transparent Indo-European etymology.\nPlato, in his \"Cratylus\", gives a folk etymology of Zeus meaning \"cause of life always to all things\", because of puns between alternate titles of Zeus (\"Zen\" and \"Dia\") with the Greek words for life and \"because of\". This etymology, along with Plato's entire method of deriving etymologies, is not supported by modern scholarship.\nDiodorus Siculus wrote that Zeus was also called Zen, because the humans believed that he was the cause of life (zen). While Lactantius wrote that he was called Zeus and Zen, not because he is the giver of life, but because he was the first who lived of the children of Cronus.\nZeus was called by numerous alternative names or surnames, known as epithets. Some epithets are the surviving names of local gods who were consolidated into the myth of Zeus.\nMythology.\nBirth.\nIn Hesiod's \"Theogony\" (c.\u2009730 \u2013 700 BC), Cronus, after castrating his father Uranus, becomes the supreme ruler of the cosmos, and weds his sister Rhea, by whom he begets three daughters and three sons: Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades, Poseidon, and lastly, \"wise\" Zeus, the youngest of the six. He swallows each child as soon as they are born, having received a prophecy from his parents, Gaia and Uranus, that one of his own children is destined to one day overthrow him as he overthrew his father. This causes Rhea \"unceasing grief\", and upon becoming pregnant with her sixth child, Zeus, she approaches her parents, Gaia and Uranus, seeking a plan to save her child and bring retribution to Cronus. Following her parents' instructions, she travels to Lyctus in Crete, where she gives birth to Zeus, handing the newborn child over to Gaia for her to raise, and Gaia takes him to a cave on Mount Aegaeon (Aegeum). Rhea then gives to Cronus, in the place of a child, a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes, which he promptly swallows, unaware that it is not his son.\nWhile Hesiod gives Lyctus as Zeus's birthplace, he is the only source to do so, and other authors give different locations. The poet Eumelos of Corinth (8th century BC), according to John the Lydian, considered Zeus to have been born in Lydia, while the Alexandrian poet Callimachus (c.\u2009310\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009240 BC), in his \"Hymn to Zeus\", says that he was born in Arcadia. Diodorus Siculus (fl. 1st century BC) seems at one point to give Mount Ida as his birthplace, but later states he is born in Dicte, and the mythographer Apollodorus (first or second century AD) similarly says he was born in a cave in Dicte. In the second century AD, Pausanias wrote that it would be impossible to count all the people claiming that Zeus was born or brought up among them.\nInfancy.\nWhile the \"Theogony\" says nothing of Zeus's upbringing other than that he grew up swiftly, other sources provide more detailed accounts. According to Apollodorus, Rhea, after giving birth to Zeus in a cave in Dicte, gives him to the nymphs Adrasteia and Ida, daughters of Melisseus, to nurse. They feed him on the milk of the she-goat Amalthea, while the Kouretes guard the cave and beat their spears on their shields so that Cronus cannot hear the infant's crying. Diodorus Siculus provides a similar account, saying that, after giving birth, Rhea travels to Mount Ida and gives the newborn Zeus to the Kouretes, who then takes him to some nymphs (not named), who raised him on a mixture of honey and milk from the goat Amalthea. He also refers to the Kouretes \"rais[ing] a great alarum\", and in doing so deceiving Cronus, and relates that when the Kouretes were carrying the newborn Zeus that the umbilical cord fell away at the river Triton.\nHyginus, the author of the \"Fabulae\", relates a version in which Cronus casts Poseidon into the sea and Hades to the Underworld instead of swallowing them. When Zeus is born, Hera (also not swallowed), asks Rhea to give her the young Zeus, and Rhea gives Cronus a stone to swallow. Hera gives him to Amalthea, who hangs his cradle from a tree, where he is not in heaven, on earth or in the sea, meaning that when Cronus later goes looking for Zeus, he is unable to find him. Hyginus also says that Ida, Althaea, and Adrasteia, usually considered the children of Oceanus, are sometimes called the daughters of Melisseus and the nurses of Zeus.\nAccording to a fragment of Epimenides, the nymphs Helice and Cynosura are the young Zeus's nurses. Cronus travels to Crete to look for Zeus, who, to conceal his presence, transforms himself into a snake and his two nurses into bears. According to Musaeus, after Zeus is born, Rhea gives him to Themis. Themis in turn gives him to Amalthea, who owns a she-goat, which nurses the young Zeus.\nAntoninus Liberalis, in his \"Metamorphoses\", says that Rhea gives birth to Zeus in a sacred cave in Crete, full of sacred bees, which become the nurses of the infant. While the cave is considered forbidden ground for both mortals and gods, a group of thieves seek to steal honey from it. Upon laying eyes on the swaddling clothes of Zeus, their bronze armour \"split[s] away from their bodies\", and Zeus would have killed them had it not been for the intervention of the Moirai and Themis; he instead transforms them into various species of birds.\nAscension to power.\nAccording to the \"Theogony\", after Zeus reaches manhood, Cronus is made to disgorge the five children and the stone \"by the stratagems of Gaia, but also by the skills and strength of Zeus\", presumably in reverse order, vomiting out the stone first, then each of the five children in the opposite order to swallowing. Zeus then sets up the stone at Delphi, so that it may act as \"a sign thenceforth and a marvel to mortal men\". Zeus next frees the Cyclopes, who, in return, and out of gratitude, give him his thunderbolt, which had previously been hidden by Gaia. Then begins the Titanomachy, the war between the Olympians, led by Zeus, and the Titans, led by Cronus, for control of the universe, with Zeus and the Olympians fighting from Mount Olympus, and the Titans fighting from Mount Othrys. The battle lasts for ten years with no clear victor emerging, until, upon Gaia's advice, Zeus releases the Hundred-Handers, who (similarly to the Cyclopes) were imprisoned beneath the Earth's surface. He gives them nectar and ambrosia and revives their spirits, and they agree to aid him in the war. Zeus then launches his final attack on the Titans, hurling bolts of lightning upon them while the Hundred-Handers attack with barrages of rocks, and the Titans are finally defeated, with Zeus banishing them to Tartarus and assigning the Hundred-Handers the task of acting as their warders.\nApollodorus provides a similar account, saying that, when Zeus reaches adulthood, he enlists the help of the Oceanid Metis, who gives Cronus an emetic, forcing to him to disgorge the stone and Zeus's five siblings. Zeus then fights a similar ten-year war against the Titans, until, upon the prophesying of Gaia, he releases the Cyclopes and Hundred-Handers from Tartarus, first slaying their warder, Campe. The Cyclopes give him his thunderbolt, Poseidon his trident and Hades his helmet of invisibility, and the Titans are defeated and the Hundred-Handers made their guards.\nAccording to the \"Iliad\", after the battle with the Titans, Zeus shares the world with his brothers, Poseidon and Hades, by drawing lots: Zeus receives the sky, Poseidon the sea, and Hades the underworld, with the earth and Olympus remaining common ground.\nChallenges to power.\nUpon assuming his place as king of the cosmos, Zeus's rule is quickly challenged. The first of these challenges to his power comes from the Giants, who fight the Olympian gods in a battle known as the Gigantomachy. According to Hesiod, the Giants are the offspring of Gaia, born from the drops of blood that fell on the ground when Cronus castrated his father Uranus; there is, however, no mention of a battle between the gods and the Giants in the \"Theogony\". It is Apollodorus who provides the most complete account of the Gigantomachy. He says that Gaia, out of anger at how Zeus had imprisoned her children, the Titans, bore the Giants to Uranus. There comes to the gods a prophecy that the Giants cannot be defeated by the gods on their own, but can be defeated only with the help of a mortal; Gaia, upon hearing of this, seeks a special \"pharmakon\" (herb) that will prevent the Giants from being killed. Zeus, however, orders Eos (Dawn), Selene (Moon) and Helios (Sun) to stop shining, and harvests all of the herb himself, before having Athena summon Heracles. In the conflict, Porphyrion, one of the most powerful of the Giants, launches an attack upon Heracles and Hera; Zeus, however, causes Porphyrion to become lustful for Hera, and when he is just about to violate her, Zeus strikes him with his thunderbolt, before Heracles deals the fatal blow with an arrow.\nIn the \"Theogony\", after Zeus defeats the Titans and banishes them to Tartarus, his rule is challenged by the monster Typhon, a giant serpentine creature who battles Zeus for control of the cosmos. According to Hesiod, Typhon is the offspring of Gaia and Tartarus, described as having a hundred snaky fire-breathing heads. Hesiod says he \"would have come to reign over mortals and immortals\" had it not been for Zeus noticing the monster and dispatching with him quickly: the two of them meet in a cataclysmic battle, before Zeus defeats him easily with his thunderbolt, and the creature is hurled down to Tartarus. Epimenides presents a different version, in which Typhon makes his way into Zeus's palace while he is sleeping, only for Zeus to wake and kill the monster with a thunderbolt. Aeschylus and Pindar give somewhat similar accounts to Hesiod, in that Zeus overcomes Typhon with relative ease, defeating him with his thunderbolt. Apollodorus, in contrast, provides a more complex narrative. Typhon is, similarly to in Hesiod, the child of Gaia and Tartarus, produced out of anger at Zeus's defeat of the Giants. The monster attacks heaven, and all of the gods, out of fear, transform into animals and flee to Egypt, except for Zeus, who attacks the monster with his thunderbolt and sickle. Typhon is wounded and retreats to Mount Kasios in Syria, where Zeus grapples with him, giving the monster a chance to wrap him in his coils, and rip out the sinews from his hands and feet. Disabled, Zeus is taken by Typhon to the Corycian Cave in Cilicia, where he is guarded by the \"she-dragon\" Delphyne. Hermes and Aegipan, however, steal back Zeus's sinews, and refit them, reviving him and allowing him to return to the battle, pursuing Typhon, who flees to Mount Nysa; there, Typhon is given \"ephemeral fruits\" by the Moirai, which reduce his strength. The monster then flees to Thrace, where he hurls mountains at Zeus, which are sent back at him by the god's thunderbolts, before, while fleeing to Sicily, Zeus launches Mount Etna upon him, finally ending him. Nonnus, who gives the longest and most detailed account, presents a narrative similar to Apollodorus, with differences such as that it is instead Cadmus and Pan who recovers Zeus's sinews, by luring Typhon with music and then tricking him.\nIn the \"Iliad\", Homer tells of another attempted overthrow, in which Hera, Poseidon, and Athena conspire to overpower Zeus and tie him in bonds. It is only because of the Nereid Thetis, who summons Briareus, one of the Hecatoncheires, to Olympus, that the other Olympians abandon their plans (out of fear for Briareus).\nPartners before Hera.\nAccording to Hesiod, Zeus takes Metis, one of the Oceanid daughters of Oceanus and Tethys, as his first wife. However, when she is about to give birth to a daughter, Athena, he swallows her whole upon the advice of Gaia and Uranus, as it had been foretold that after bearing a daughter, she would give birth to a son, who would overthrow him as king of gods and mortals; it is from this position that Metis gives counsel to Zeus. In time, Athena is born, emerging from Zeus's head, but the foretold son never comes forth. Apollodorus presents a similar version, stating that Metis took many forms in attempting to avoid Zeus's embraces, and that it was Gaia alone who warned Zeus of the son who would overthrow him. According to a fragment likely from the Hesiodic corpus, quoted by Chrysippus, it is out of anger at Hera for producing Hephaestus on her own that Zeus has intercourse with Metis, and then swallows her, thereby giving rise to Athena from himself. A scholiast on the \"Iliad\", in contrast, states that when Zeus swallows her, Metis is pregnant with Athena not by Zeus himself, but by the Cyclops Brontes. The motif of Zeus swallowing Metis can be seen as a continuation of the succession myth: it is prophesied that a son of Zeus will overthrow him, just as he overthrew his father, but whereas Cronos met his end because he did not swallow the real Zeus, Zeus holds onto his power because he successfully swallows the threat, in the form of the potential mother, and so the \"cycle of displacement\" is brought to an end. In addition, the myth can be seen as an allegory for Zeus gaining the wisdom of Metis for himself by swallowing her.\nIn Hesiod's account, Zeus's second wife is Themis, one of the Titan daughters of Uranus and Gaia, with whom he has the Horae, listed as Eunomia, Dike and Eirene, and the three Moirai: Clotho, Lachesis and Atropos. A fragment from Pindar calls Themis Zeus's first wife, and states that she is brought by the Moirai (in this version not her daughters) up to Olympus, where she becomes the bride of Zeus and bears him the Horae. According to Hesiod, Zeus lies next with the Oceanid Eurynome, by whom he becomes the father of the three Charites: Aglaea, Euphrosyne and Thalia. Zeus then partners with his sister Demeter, producing Persephone. Zeus's next union is with the Titan Mnemosyne; as described at the beginning of the \"Theogony\", Zeus lies with Mnemosyne in Piera each night for nine nights, producing the nine Muses. His next partner is the Titan Leto, by whom he fathers the twins Apollo and Artemis, who, according to the \"Homeric Hymn to Apollo\", are born on the island of Delos. In Hesiod's account, only then does Zeus take his sister Hera as his wife.\nMarriage to Hera.\nWhile Hera is Zeus's last wife in Hesiod's version, in other accounts she is his first and only wife. In the \"Theogony\", the couple has three children, Ares, Hebe, and Eileithyia. While Hesiod states that Hera produces Hephaestus on her own after Athena is born from Zeus's head, other versions, including Homer, have Hephaestus as a child of Zeus and Hera as well.\nVarious authors give descriptions of a youthful affair between Zeus and Hera. In the \"Iliad\", the pair are described as having first lay with each other before Cronus is sent to Tartarus, without the knowledge of their parents. A scholiast on the \"Iliad\" states that, after Cronus is banished to Tartarus, Oceanus and Tethys give Hera to Zeus in marriage, and only shortly after the two are wed, Hera gives birth to Hephaestus, having lay secretly with Zeus on the island of Samos beforehand; to conceal this act, she claimed that she had produced Hephaestus on her own. According to another scholiast on the \"Iliad\", Callimachus, in his \"Aetia\", says that Zeus lay with Hera for three hundred years on the island of Samos.\nAccording to a scholion on Theocritus's \"Idylls\", Zeus, one day seeing Hera walking apart from the other gods, becomes intent on having intercourse with her, and transforms himself into a cuckoo bird, landing on Mount Thornax. He creates a terrible storm, and when Hera arrives at the mountain and sees the bird, which sits on her lap, she takes pity on it, laying her cloak over it. Zeus then transforms back and takes hold of her; when she refuses to have intercourse with him because of their mother, he promises that she will become his wife. Pausanias similarly refers to Zeus transforming himself into a cuckoo to woo Hera, and identifies the location as Mount Thornax.\nAccording to a version from Plutarch, as recorded by Eusebius in his \"Praeparatio evangelica\", Hera is raised by a nymph named Macris on the island of Euboea when Zeus kidnaps her, taking her to Mount Cithaeron, where they find a shady hollow, which serves as a \"natural bridal chamber\". When Macris comes to look for Hera, Cithaeron, the tutelary deity of the mountain, stops her, saying that Zeus is sleeping there with Leto. Photius, in his \"Bibliotheca\", tells us that in Ptolemy Hephaestion's \"New History\", Hera refuses to lay with Zeus, and hides in a cave to avoid him, before an earthborn man named Achilles convinces her to marry Zeus, leading to the pair first sleeping with each other. According to Stephanus of Byzantium, Zeus and Hera first lay together at the city of Hermione, having come there from Crete. Callimachus, in a fragment from his \"Aetia\", also apparently makes reference to the couple's union occurring at Naxos.\nThough no complete account of Zeus and Hera's wedding exists, various authors make reference to it. According to a scholiast on Apollonius of Rhodes's \"Argonautica\", Pherecydes states that when Zeus and Hera are being married, Gaia brings a tree which produces golden apples as a wedding gift. Eratosthenes and Hyginus attribute a similar story to Pherecydes, in which Hera is amazed by the gift, and asks for the apples to be planted in the \"garden of the gods\", nearby to Mount Atlas. Apollodorus specifies them as the golden apples of the Hesperides, and says that Gaia gives them to Zeus after the marriage. According to Diodorus Siculus, the location of the marriage is in the land of the Knossians, nearby to the river Theren, while Lactantius attributes to Varro the statement that the couple are married on the island of Samos.\nThere exist several stories in which Zeus, receiving advice, is able to reconcile with an angered Hera. According to Pausanias, Hera, angry with her husband, retreats to the island of Euboea, where she was raised, and Zeus, unable to resolve the situation, seeks the advice of Cithaeron, ruler of Plataea, supposedly the most intelligent man on earth. Cithaeron instructs him to fashion a wooden statue and dress it as a bride, and then pretend that he is marrying one \"Plataea\", a daughter of Asopus. When Hera hears of this, she immediately rushes there, only to discover the ruse upon ripping away the bridal clothing; she is so relieved that the couple are reconciled. According to a version from Plutarch, as recorded by Eusebius in his \"Praeparatio evangelica\", when Hera is angry with her husband, she retreats instead to Cithaeron, and Zeus goes to the earth-born man Alalcomeneus, who suggests he pretend to marry someone else. With the help of Alalcomeneus, Zeus creates a wooden statue from an oak tree, dresses it as a bride, and names it Daidale. When preparations are being made for the wedding, Hera rushes down from Cithaeron, followed by the women of Plataia, and upon discovering the trick, the couple are reconciled, with the matter ending in joy and laughter among all involved.\nAffairs.\nAfter his marriage to Hera, different authors describe Zeus's numerous affairs with various mortal women. In many of these affairs, Zeus transforms himself into an animal, someone else, or some other form. According to a scholion on the \"Iliad\" (citing Hesiod and Bacchylides), when Europa is picking flowers with her female companions in a meadow in Phoenicia, Zeus transforms himself into a bull, lures her from the others, and then carries her across the sea to the island of Crete, where he resumes his usual form to sleep with her. In Euripides's \"Helen\", Zeus takes the form of a swan, and after being chased by an eagle, finds shelter in the lap of Leda, subsequently seducing her, while in Euripides's lost play \"Antiope\", Zeus apparently took the form of a satyr to sleep with Antiope. Various authors speak of Zeus raping Callisto, one of the companions of Artemis, doing so in the form of Artemis herself according to Ovid (or, as mentioned by Apollodorus, in the form of Apollo), and Pherecydes relates that Zeus sleeps with Alcmene, the wife of Amphitryon, in the form of her own husband. Several accounts state that Zeus approached the Argive princess Danae in the form of a shower of gold, and according to Ovid he abducts Aegina in the form of a flame.\nIn accounts of Zeus's affairs, Hera is often depicted as a jealous wife, with there being various stories of her persecuting either the women with whom Zeus sleeps, or their children by him. Several authors relate that Zeus sleeps with Io, a priestess of Hera, who is subsequently turned into a cow, and suffers at Hera's hands: according to Apollodorus, Hera sends a gadfly to sting the cow, driving her all the way to Egypt, where she is finally transformed back into human form. In later accounts of Zeus's affair with Semele, a daughter of Cadmus and Harmonia, Hera tricks her into persuading Zeus to grant her any promise. Semele asks him to come to her as he comes to his own wife Hera, and when Zeus upholds this promise, she dies out of fright and is reduced to ashes. According to Callimachus, after Zeus sleeps with Callisto, Hera turns her into a bear, and instructs Artemis to shoot her. In addition, Zeus's son by Alcmene, the hero Heracles, is persecuted continuously throughout his mortal life by Hera, up until his apotheosis.\nAccording to Diodorus Siculus, Alcmene, the mother of Heracles, was the very last mortal woman Zeus ever slept with; following the birth of Heracles, he ceased to beget humans altogether, and fathered no more children.\nOffspring.\nThe following is a list of Zeus's offspring, by various mothers. Beside each offspring, the earliest source to record the parentage is given, along with the century to which the source dates.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPrometheus and conflicts with humans.\nWhen the gods met at Mecone to discuss which portions they will receive after a sacrifice, the titan Prometheus decided to trick Zeus so that humans receive the better portions. He sacrificed a large ox, and divided it into two piles. In one pile he put all the meat and most of the fat, covering it with the ox's grotesque stomach, while in the other pile, he dressed up the bones with fat. Prometheus then invited Zeus to choose; Zeus chose the pile of bones. This set a precedent for sacrifices, where humans will keep the fat for themselves and burn the bones for the gods.\nZeus, enraged at Prometheus's deception, prohibited the use of fire by humans. Prometheus, however, stole fire from Olympus in a fennel stalk and gave it to humans. This further enraged Zeus, who punished Prometheus by binding him to a cliff, where an eagle constantly ate Prometheus's liver, which regenerated every night. Prometheus was eventually freed from his misery by Heracles.\nNow Zeus, angry at humans, decides to give humanity a punishing gift to compensate for the boon they had been given. He commands Hephaestus to mold from earth the first woman, a \"beautiful evil\" whose descendants would torment the human race. After Hephaestus does so, several other gods contribute to her creation. Hermes names the woman 'Pandora'.\nPandora was given in marriage to Prometheus's brother Epimetheus. Zeus gave her a jar which contained many evils. Pandora opened the jar and released all the evils, which made mankind miserable. Only hope remained inside the jar.\nWhen Zeus was atop Mount Olympus he was appalled by human sacrifice and other signs of human decadence. He decided to wipe out mankind and flooded the world with the help of his brother Poseidon. After the flood, only Deucalion and Pyrrha remained. This flood narrative is a common motif in mythology.\nIn the \"Iliad\".\nThe \"Iliad\" is an ancient Greek epic poem attributed to Homer about the Trojan War and the battle over the City of Troy, in which Zeus plays a major part.\nScenes in which Zeus appears include:\nOther myths.\nWhen Hades requested to marry Zeus's daughter, Persephone, Zeus approved and advised Hades to abduct Persephone, as her mother Demeter would not allow her to marry Hades.\nIn the Orphic \"Rhapsodic Theogony\" (first century BC/AD), Zeus wanted to marry his mother Rhea. After Rhea refused to marry him, Zeus turned into a snake and raped her. Rhea became pregnant and gave birth to Persephone. Zeus in the form of a snake would mate with his daughter Persephone, which resulted in the birth of Dionysus.\nZeus granted Callirrhoe's prayer that her sons by Alcmaeon, Acarnan and Amphoterus, grow quickly so that they might be able to avenge the death of their father by the hands of Phegeus and his two sons.\nBoth Zeus and Poseidon wooed Thetis, daughter of Nereus. But when Themis (or Prometheus) prophesied that the son born of Thetis would be mightier than his father, Thetis was married off to the mortal Peleus.\nZeus was afraid that his grandson Asclepius would teach resurrection to humans, so he killed Asclepius with his thunderbolt. This angered Asclepius's father, Apollo, who in turn killed the Cyclopes who had fashioned the thunderbolts of Zeus. Angered at this, Zeus would have imprisoned Apollo in Tartarus. However, at the request of Apollo's mother, Leto, Zeus instead ordered Apollo to serve as a slave to King Admetus of Pherae for a year. According to Diodorus Siculus, Zeus killed Asclepius because of complains from Hades, who was worried that the number of people in the underworld was diminishing because of Asclepius's resurrections.\nThe winged horse Pegasus carried the thunderbolts of Zeus.\nZeus took pity on Ixion, a man who was guilty of murdering his father-in-law, by purifying him and bringing him to Olympus. However, Ixion started to lust after Hera. Hera complained about this to her husband, and Zeus decided to test Ixion. Zeus fashioned a cloud that resembles Hera (Nephele) and laid the cloud-Hera in Ixion's bed. Ixion coupled with Nephele, resulting in the birth of Centaurus. Zeus punished Ixion for lusting after Hera by tying him to a wheel that spins forever.\nOnce, Helios the sun god gave his chariot to his inexperienced son Phaethon to drive. Phaethon could not control his father's steeds so he ended up taking the chariot too high, freezing the earth, or too low, burning everything to the ground. The earth itself prayed to Zeus, and in order to prevent further disaster, Zeus hurled a thunderbolt at Phaethon, killing him and saving the world from further harm. In a satirical work, \"Dialogues of the Gods\" by Lucian, Zeus berates Helios for allowing such thing to happen; he returns the damaged chariot to him and warns him that if he dares do that again, he will strike him with one of this thunderbolts.\nRoles and epithets.\nZeus played a dominant role, presiding over the Greek Olympian pantheon. He fathered many of the heroes and was featured in many of their local cults. Though the Homeric \"cloud collector\" was the god of the sky and thunder like his Near-Eastern counterparts, he was also the supreme cultural artifact; in some senses, he was the embodiment of Greek religious beliefs and the archetypal Greek deity.\nPopular conceptions of Zeus differed widely from place to place. Local varieties of Zeus often have little in common with each other except the name. They exercised different areas of authority and were worshiped in different ways; for example, some local cults conceived of Zeus as a chthonic earth-god rather than a god of the sky. These local divinities were gradually consolidated, via conquest and religious syncretism, with the Homeric conception of Zeus. Local or idiosyncratic versions of Zeus were given epithets \u2014 surnames or titles which distinguish different conceptions of the god.\nThese epithets or titles applied to Zeus emphasized different aspects of his wide-ranging authority:\nCults.\nPanhellenic cults.\nThe major center where all Greeks converged to pay honor to their chief god was Olympia. Their quadrennial festival featured the famous Games. There was also an altar to Zeus made not of stone, but of ash, from the accumulated remains of many centuries' worth of animals sacrificed there.\nOutside of the major inter-polis sanctuaries, there were no modes of worshipping Zeus precisely shared across the Greek world. Most of the titles listed below, for instance, could be found at any number of Greek temples from Asia Minor to Sicily. Certain modes of ritual were held in common as well: sacrificing a white animal over a raised altar, for instance.\nZeus Velchanos.\nWith one exception, Greeks were unanimous in recognizing the birthplace of Zeus as Crete. Minoan culture contributed many essentials of ancient Greek religion: \"by a hundred channels the old civilization emptied itself into the new\", Will Durant observed, and Cretan Zeus retained his youthful Minoan features. The local child of the Great Mother, \"a small and inferior deity who took the roles of son and consort\", whose Minoan name the Greeks Hellenized as Velchanos, was in time assumed as an epithet by Zeus, as transpired at many other sites, and he came to be venerated in Crete as Zeus Velchanos (\"boy-Zeus\"), often simply the \"Kouros\".\nIn Crete, Zeus was worshipped at a number of caves at Knossos, Ida and Palaikastro. In the Hellenistic period a small sanctuary dedicated to Zeus Velchanos was founded at the Hagia Triada site of an earlier Minoan town. Broadly contemporary coins from Phaistos show the form under which he was worshiped: a youth sits among the branches of a tree, with a cockerel on his knees. On other Cretan coins Velchanos is represented as an eagle and in association with a goddess celebrating a mystic marriage. Inscriptions at Gortyn and Lyttos record a \"Velchania\" festival, showing that Velchanios was still widely venerated in Hellenistic Crete.\nThe stories of Minos and Epimenides suggest that these caves were once used for incubatory divination by kings and priests. The dramatic setting of Plato's \"Laws\" is along the pilgrimage-route to one such site, emphasizing archaic Cretan knowledge. On Crete, Zeus was represented in art as a long-haired youth rather than a mature adult and hymned as \"ho megas kouros\", \"the great youth\". Ivory statuettes of the \"Divine Boy\" were unearthed near the Labyrinth at Knossos by Sir Arthur Evans. With the Kouretes, a band of ecstatic armed dancers, he presided over the rigorous military-athletic training and secret rites of the Cretan \"paideia\".\nThe myth of the death of Cretan Zeus, localised in numerous mountain sites though only mentioned in a comparatively late source, Callimachus, together with the assertion of Antoninus Liberalis that a fire shone forth annually from the birth-cave the infant shared with a mythic swarm of bees, suggests that Velchanos had been an annual vegetative spirit.\nThe Hellenistic writer Euhemerus apparently proposed a theory that Zeus had actually been a great king of Crete and that posthumously, his glory had slowly turned him into a deity. The works of Euhemerus himself have not survived, but Christian patristic writers took up the suggestion.\nZeus Lykaios.\nThe epithet Zeus Lykaios (\u039b\u03cd\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2; \"wolf-Zeus\") is assumed by Zeus only in connection with the archaic festival of the Lykaia on the slopes of Mount Lykaion (\"Wolf Mountain\"), the tallest peak in rustic Arcadia; Zeus had only a formal connection with the rituals and myths of this primitive rite of passage with an ancient threat of cannibalism and the possibility of a werewolf transformation for the ephebes who were the participants. Near the ancient ash-heap where the sacrifices took place was a forbidden precinct in which, allegedly, no shadows were ever cast.\nAccording to Plato, a particular clan would gather on the mountain to make a sacrifice every nine years to Zeus Lykaios, and a single morsel of human entrails would be intermingled with the animal's. Whoever ate the human flesh was said to turn into a wolf, and could only regain human form if he did not eat again of human flesh until the next nine-year cycle had ended. There were games associated with the Lykaia, removed in the fourth century to the first urbanization of Arcadia, Megalopolis; there the major temple was dedicated to Zeus Lykaios.\nThere is, however, the crucial detail that \"Lykaios\" or \"Lykeios\" (epithets of Zeus and Apollo) may derive from Proto-Greek *, \"light\", a noun still attested in compounds such as , \"twilight\", , \"year\" (lit.\u2009'light's course\") etc. This, Cook argues, brings indeed much new 'light' to the matter as Achaeus, the contemporary tragedian of Sophocles, spoke of Zeus Lykaios as \"starry-eyed\", and this Zeus Lykaios may just be the Arcadian Zeus, son of Aether, described by Cicero. Again under this new signification may be seen Pausanias's descriptions of Lykosoura being 'the first city that ever the sun beheld', and of the altar of Zeus, at the summit of Mount Lykaion, before which stood two columns bearing gilded eagles and 'facing the sun-rise'. Further Cook sees only the tale of Zeus's sacred precinct at Mount Lykaion allowing no shadows referring to Zeus as 'god of light' (Lykaios).\nAdditional cults.\nAlthough etymology indicates that Zeus was originally a sky god, many Greek cities honored a local Zeus who lived underground. Athenians and Sicilians honored Zeus Meilichios (\u039c\u03b5\u03b9\u03bb\u03af\u03c7\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2; \"kindly\" or \"honeyed\") while other cities had Zeus Chthonios (\"earthy\"), Zeus Katachthonios (\u039a\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c7\u03b8\u03cc\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2; \"under-the-earth\") and Zeus Plousios (\"wealth-bringing\"). These deities might be represented as snakes or in human form in visual art, or, for emphasis as both together in one image. They also received offerings of black animal victims sacrificed into sunken pits, as did chthonic deities like Persephone and Demeter, and also the heroes at their tombs. Olympian gods, by contrast, usually received white victims sacrificed upon raised altars.\nIn some cases, cities were not entirely sure whether the \"daimon\" to whom they sacrificed was a hero or an underground Zeus. Thus the shrine at Lebadaea in Boeotia might belong to the hero Trophonius or to Zeus Trephonius (\"the nurturing\"), depending on whether you believe Pausanias, or Strabo. The hero Amphiaraus was honored as Zeus Amphiaraus at Oropus outside of Thebes, and the Spartans even had a shrine to Zeus Agamemnon. Ancient Molossian kings sacrificed to Zeus Areius (\u0391\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2). Strabo mention that at Tralles there was the Zeus Larisaeus (\u039b\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2). In Ithome, they honored the Zeus Ithomatas, they had a sanctuary and a statue of Zeus and also held an annual festival in honour of Zeus which was called Ithomaea (\u1f30\u03b8\u03ce\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9\u03b1).\nHecatomphonia.\nHecatomphonia (), meaning killing of a hundred, from \u1f11\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd \"a hundred\" and \u03c6\u03bf\u03bd\u03b5\u03cd\u03c9 \"to kill\". It was a custom of Messenians, at which they offered sacrifice to Zeus when any of them had killed a hundred enemies. Aristomenes have offered three times this sacrifice at the Messenian wars against Sparta.\nNon-panhellenic cults.\nIn addition to the Panhellenic titles and conceptions listed above, local cults maintained their own idiosyncratic ideas about the king of gods and men. With the epithet Zeus Aetnaeus he was worshiped on Mount Aetna, where there was a statue of him, and a local festival called the Aetnaea in his honor. Other examples are listed below. As Zeus Aeneius or Zeus Aenesius (\u0391\u03b9\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2), he was worshiped in the island of Cephalonia, where he had a temple on Mount Aenos.\nOracles.\nAlthough most oracle sites were usually dedicated to Apollo, the heroes, or various goddesses like Themis, a few oracular sites were dedicated to Zeus. In addition, some foreign oracles, such as Ba\u02bfal's at Heliopolis, were associated with Zeus in Greek or Jupiter in Latin.\nThe Oracle at Dodona.\nThe cult of Zeus at Dodona in Epirus, where there is evidence of religious activity from the second millennium BC onward, centered on a sacred oak. When the \"Odyssey\" was composed (circa 750 BC), divination was done there by barefoot priests called \"Selloi\", who lay on the ground and observed the rustling of the leaves and branches. By the time Herodotus wrote about Dodona, female priestesses called peleiades (\"doves\") had replaced the male priests.\nZeus's consort at Dodona was not Hera, but the goddess Dione \u2014 whose name is a feminine form of \"Zeus\". Her status as a titaness suggests to some that she may have been a more powerful pre-Hellenic deity, and perhaps the original occupant of the oracle.\nThe Oracle at Siwa.\nThe oracle of Ammon at the Siwa Oasis in the Western Desert of Egypt did not lie within the bounds of the Greek world before Alexander's day, but it already loomed large in the Greek mind during the archaic era: Herodotus mentions consultations with Zeus Ammon in his account of the Persian War. Zeus Ammon was especially favored at Sparta, where a temple to him existed by the time of the Peloponnesian War.\nAfter Alexander made a trek into the desert to consult the oracle at Siwa, the figure arose in the Hellenistic imagination of a Libyan Sibyl.\nIdentifications with other gods.\nForeign gods.\nZeus was identified with the Roman god Jupiter and associated in the syncretic classical imagination (see ) with various other deities, such as the Egyptian Ammon and the Etruscan Tinia. He, along with Dionysus, absorbed the role of the chief Phrygian god Sabazios in the syncretic deity known in Rome as Sabazius. The Seleucid ruler Antiochus IV Epiphanes erected a statue of Zeus Olympios in the Judean Temple in Jerusalem. Hellenizing Jews referred to this statue as Baal Shamen (in English, Lord of Heaven).\nZeus is also identified with the Hindu deity Indra. Not only they are the king of gods, but their weapon - thunder is similar.\nHelios.\nZeus is occasionally conflated with the Hellenic sun god, Helios, who is sometimes either directly referred to as Zeus's eye, or clearly implied as such. Hesiod, for instance, describes Zeus's eye as effectively the sun. This perception is possibly derived from earlier Proto-Indo-European religion, in which the sun is occasionally envisioned as the eye of *\"Dy\u1e17us P\u1e25at\u1e17r\" (see Hvare-khshaeta). Euripides in his now lost tragedy \"Mysians\" described Zeus as \"sun-eyed\", and Helios is said elsewhere to be \"the brilliant eye of Zeus, giver of life\". In another of Euripides's tragedies, \"Medea\", the chorus refers to Helios as \"light born from Zeus.\"\nAlthough the connection of Helios to Zeus does not seem to have basis in early Greek cult and writings, nevertheless there are many examples of direct identification in later times. The Hellenistic period gave birth to Serapis, a Greco-Egyptian deity conceived as a chthonic avatar of Zeus, whose solar nature is indicated by the sun crown and rays the Greeks depicted him with. Frequent joint dedications to \"Zeus-Serapis-Helios\" have been found all over the Mediterranean, for example, the Anastasy papyrus (now housed in the British Museum equates Helios to not just Zeus and Serapis but also Mithras, and a series of inscriptions from Trachonitis give evidence of the cult of \"Zeus the Unconquered Sun\". There is evidence of Zeus being worshipped as a solar god in the Aegean island of Amorgos, based on a lacunose inscription (\"Zeus the Sun\"), meaning sun elements of Zeus's worship could be as early as the fifth century BC.\nThe Cretan Zeus Tallaios had solar elements to his cult. \"Talos\" was the local equivalent of Helios.\nLater representations.\nPhilosophy.\nIn Neoplatonism, Zeus's relation to the gods familiar from mythology is taught as the Demiurge or Divine Mind, specifically within Plotinus's work the \"Enneads\" and the \"Platonic Theology\" of Proclus.\nThe Bible.\nZeus is mentioned in the New Testament twice, first in Acts 14:8\u201313: When the people living in Lystra saw the Apostle Paul heal a lame man, they considered Paul and his partner Barnabas to be gods, identifying Paul with Hermes and Barnabas with Zeus, even trying to offer them sacrifices with the crowd. Two ancient inscriptions discovered in 1909 near Lystra testify to the worship of these two gods in that city. One of the inscriptions refers to the \"priests of Zeus\", and the other mentions \"Hermes Most Great\" and \"Zeus the sun-god\".\nThe second occurrence is in Acts 28:11: the name of the ship in which the prisoner Paul set sail from the island of Malta bore the figurehead \"Sons of Zeus\" aka Castor and Pollux (Dioscuri).\nThe deuterocanonical book of 2 Maccabees 6:1, 2 talks of King Antiochus IV (Epiphanes), who in his attempt to stamp out the Jewish religion, directed that the temple at Jerusalem be profaned and rededicated to Zeus (Jupiter Olympius).\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "34399", "revid": "51072075", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34399", "title": "Zimbabwe", "text": "Country in Southeastern Africa\nZimbabwe, officially the Republic of Zimbabwe or Beggarsburg, formerly Rhodesia, is a landlocked country in Southeast Africa, between the Zambezi and Limpopo River, bordered by South Africa to the south, Botswana to the southwest, Zambia to the north, and Mozambique to the east. The capital and largest city is Harare, and the second largest is Bulawayo.\nA country of roughly 16.9 million people as per 2024 estimates, Zimbabwe's largest ethnic group are the Shona, who make up 80% of the population, followed by the Northern Ndebele and other smaller minorities. Zimbabwe has 16 official languages, with English, Shona, and Ndebele the most common. Zimbabwe is a member of the United Nations, the Southern African Development Community, the African Union, and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa.\nThe region was long inhabited by the San, and was settled by Bantu peoples around 2,000 years ago. Beginning in the 11th century the Shona people constructed the city of Great Zimbabwe, which became one of the major African trade centres by the 13th century. From there, the Kingdom of Zimbabwe was established, followed by the Mutapa and Rozvi empires. The British South Africa Company of Cecil Rhodes demarcated the Rhodesia region in 1890 when they conquered Mashonaland and later in 1893 Matabeleland after the First Matabele War. Company rule ended in 1923 with the establishment of Southern Rhodesia as a self-governing British colony. In 1965, the white minority government unilaterally declared independence as Rhodesia. The state endured international isolation and a 15-year guerrilla war with black rebel forces; this culminated in a peace agreement that established \"de jure\" sovereignty as Zimbabwe in April 1980.\nRobert Mugabe became Prime Minister of Zimbabwe in 1980, when his ZANU\u2013PF party won the general election following the end of white minority rule and has remained the country's dominant party since. He was the President of Zimbabwe from 1987, after converting the country's initial parliamentary system into a presidential one, until his resignation in 2017. Under Mugabe's authoritarian regime, the state security apparatus dominated the country and was responsible for widespread human rights violations, which received worldwide condemnation. From 1997 to 2008, the economy experienced consistent decline (and in the latter years, hyperinflation), though it has since seen rapid growth after the use of currencies other than the Zimbabwean dollar was permitted. In 2017, in the wake of over a year of protests against his government as well as Zimbabwe's rapidly declining economy, a coup d'\u00e9tat resulted in Mugabe's resignation. Emmerson Mnangagwa has since served as Zimbabwe's president.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Zimbabwe\" stems from a Shona term for Great Zimbabwe, a medieval city (Masvingo) in the country's south-east. Two different theories address the origin of the word. Many sources hold that \"Zimbabwe\" derives from \"dzimba-dza-mabwe\", translated from the Karanga dialect of Shona as \"houses of stones\" (\"dzimba\" = plural of \"imba\", \"house\"; \"mabwe\" = plural of \"ibwe\", \"stone\"). The Karanga-speaking Shona people live around Great Zimbabwe in the modern-day Masvingo province. Archaeologist Peter Garlake claims that \"Zimbabwe\" represents a contracted form of \"dzimba-hwe\", which means \"venerated houses\" in the Zezuru dialect of Shona and usually references chiefs' houses or graves.\nZimbabwe was formerly known as Southern Rhodesia (1898), Rhodesia (1965), and Zimbabwe Rhodesia (1979). The first recorded use of \"Zimbabwe\" as a term of national reference dates from 1960 as a coinage by the black nationalist Michael Mawema, whose Zimbabwe National Party became the first to officially use the name in 1961. The term \"Rhodesia\"\u2014derived from the surname of Cecil Rhodes, the primary instigator of the British colonisation of the territory\u2014was perceived by African nationalists as inappropriate because of its colonial origin and connotations.\nAccording to Mawema, black nationalists held a meeting in 1960 to choose an alternative name for the country, proposing names such as \"Matshobana\" and \"Monomotapa\" before his suggestion, \"Zimbabwe\", prevailed. It was initially unclear how the chosen term was to be used\u2014a letter written by Mawema in 1961 refers to \"Zimbabweland\" \u2014 but \"Zimbabwe\" was sufficiently established by 1962 to become the generally preferred term of the black nationalist movement.\nLike those of many African countries that gained independence during the Cold War, \"Zimbabwe\" is an ethnically neutral name. It is debatable to what extent Zimbabwe, being over 80% Shona and dominated by them in various ways, can be described as a nation state. The constitution acknowledges 16 languages, but only embraces two of them nationally, Shona and English. Shona is taught widely in schools, unlike Ndebele. Zimbabwe has never had a non-Shona head of state.\nHistory.\nPre-colonial era.\nArchaeological records date archaic human settlement of present-day Zimbabwe to at least 500,000 years ago. Zimbabwe's earliest known inhabitants were most likely the San people, who left behind a legacy of arrowheads and cave paintings. Approximately 2,000 years ago, the first Bantu-speaking farmers arrived during the Bantu expansion.\nSocieties speaking proto-Shona languages first emerged in the middle Limpopo River valley in the 9th century before moving on to the Zimbabwean highlands. The Zimbabwean plateau became the centre of subsequent Shona states, beginning around the 10th century. Around the early 10th century, trade developed with Arab merchants on the Indian Ocean coast, helping to develop the Kingdom of Mapungubwe in the 13th century. This was the precursor to the Shona civilisations that dominated the region from the 13th century, evidenced by ruins at Great Zimbabwe, near Masvingo, and by other smaller sites. The main archaeological site used a unique dry stone architecture. The Kingdom of Mapungubwe was the first in a series of trading states which had developed in Zimbabwe by the time the first European explorers arrived from Portugal. These states traded gold, ivory, and copper for cloth and glass.\nBy 1300, the Kingdom of Zimbabwe eclipsed Mapungubwe. This Shona state further refined and expanded upon Mapungubwe's stone architecture. From c. 1450 to 1760, the Kingdom of Mutapa ruled much of the area of present-day Zimbabwe, plus parts of central Mozambique. It is known by many names including the Mutapa Empire, also known as \"Mwene Mutapa\" or \"Monomotapa\" as well as \"Munhumutapa\", and was renowned for its strategic trade routes with the Arabs and Portugal. The Portuguese sought to monopolise this influence and began a series of wars which left the empire in near collapse in the early 17th century.\nAs a direct response to increased European presence in the interior a new Shona state emerged, known as the Rozwi Empire. Relying on centuries of military, political and religious development, the Rozwi (meaning \"destroyers\") expelled the Portuguese from the Zimbabwean plateau in 1683. Around 1821 the Zulu general Mzilikazi of the Khumalo clan successfully rebelled against King Shaka and established his own clan, the Ndebele. The Ndebele fought their way northwards into the Transvaal, leaving a trail of destruction in their wake and beginning an era of widespread devastation known as the Mfecane. When Dutch trekboers converged on the Transvaal in 1836, they drove the tribe even further northward, with the assistance of Tswana Barolong warriors and Griqua commandos. By 1838 the Ndebele had conquered the Rozwi Empire, along with the other smaller Shona states, and reduced them to vassaldom.\nAfter losing their remaining South African lands in 1840, Mzilikazi and his tribe permanently settled in the southwest of present-day Zimbabwe in what became known as Matabeleland, establishing Bulawayo as their capital. Mzilikazi then organised his society into a military system with regimental kraals, similar to those of Shaka, which was stable enough to repel further Boer incursions. Mzilikazi died in 1868; following a violent power struggle, his son Lobengula succeeded him.\nColonial era and Rhodesia (1888\u20131964).\nIn the 1880s, European colonists arrived with Cecil Rhodes's British South Africa Company (chartered in 1889). In 1888, Rhodes obtained a concession for mining rights from King Lobengula of the Ndebele peoples. He presented this concession to persuade the government of the United Kingdom to grant a royal charter to the company over Matabeleland, and its subject states such as Mashonaland as well. Rhodes used this document in 1890 to justify sending the Pioneer Column, a group of Europeans protected by well-armed British South Africa Police (BSAP) through Matabeleland and into Shona territory to establish Fort Salisbury (present-day Harare), and thereby establish company rule over the area. In 1893 and 1894, with the help of their new Maxim guns, the BSAP would go on to defeat the Ndebele in the First Matabele War. Rhodes additionally sought permission to negotiate similar concessions covering all territory between the Limpopo River and Lake Tanganyika, then known as \"Zambesia\". In accordance with the terms of aforementioned concessions and treaties, mass settlement was encouraged, with the British maintaining control over labour as well as over precious metals and other mineral resources.\nIn 1895, the BSAC adopted the name \"Rhodesia\" for the territory, in honour of Rhodes. In 1898, \"Southern Rhodesia\" became the official name for the region south of the Zambezi river, which later adopted the name \"Zimbabwe\". The region to the north, administered separately, was later termed Northern Rhodesia (present-day Zambia). Shortly after the disastrous Rhodes-sponsored Jameson Raid on the South African Republic, the Ndebele rebelled against white rule, led by their charismatic religious leader, Mlimo. The Second Matabele War of 1896\u20131897 lasted in Matabeleland until 1896, when Mlimo was assassinated by American scout Frederick Russell Burnham. Shona agitators staged unsuccessful revolts (known as \"Chimurenga\") against company rule during 1896 and 1897. Following these failed insurrections, the Rhodes administration subdued the Ndebele and Shona groups and organised the land with a disproportionate bias favouring Europeans, thus displacing many indigenous peoples.\nThe United Kingdom annexed Southern Rhodesia on 12 September 1923. Shortly after annexation, on 1 October 1923, the first constitution for the new Colony of Southern Rhodesia came into force. Under the new constitution, Southern Rhodesia became a self-governing British colony, subsequent to a 1922 referendum. Rhodesians of all races served on behalf of the United Kingdom during the two World Wars in the early-20th century. Proportional to the white population, Southern Rhodesia contributed more \"per capita\" to both the First and Second World Wars than any other part of the empire, including Britain.\nThe 1930 Land Apportionment Act restricted black land ownership to certain segments of the country, setting aside large areas solely for the purchase of the white minority. This act, which led to rapidly rising inequality, became the subject of frequent calls for subsequent land reform. In 1953, in the face of African opposition, Britain consolidated the two Rhodesias with Nyasaland (Malawi) in the ill-fated Central African Federation, which Southern Rhodesia essentially dominated. Growing African nationalism and general dissent, particularly in Nyasaland, persuaded Britain to dissolve the union in 1963, forming three separate divisions. While multiracial democracy was finally introduced to Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, Southern Rhodesians of European ancestry continued to enjoy minority rule.\nFollowing Zambian independence (effective from October 1964), Ian Smith's Rhodesian Front government in Salisbury dropped the designation \"Southern\" in 1964 (once \"Northern Rhodesia\" had changed its name to \"Zambia\", having the word \"Southern\" before the name \"Rhodesia\" became unnecessary and the country simply became known as \"Rhodesia\" afterwards). Intent on effectively repudiating the recently adopted British policy of \"no independence before majority rule\", Smith issued a Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) from the United Kingdom on 11 November 1965. This marked the first such course taken by a rebel British colony since the American declaration of 1776, which Smith and others indeed claimed provided a suitable precedent to their own actions.\nDeclaration of independence and civil war (1965\u20131980).\nThe United Kingdom deemed the Rhodesian declaration an act of rebellion but did not re-establish control by force. The British government petitioned the United Nations for sanctions against Rhodesia pending unsuccessful talks with Smith's administration in 1966 and 1968. In December 1966, the organisation complied, imposing the first mandatory trade embargo on an autonomous state. These sanctions were expanded again in 1968.\nA civil war ensued when Joshua Nkomo's Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) and Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), supported actively by communist powers and neighbouring African nations, initiated guerrilla operations against Rhodesia's predominantly white government. ZAPU was supported by the Soviet Union, the Warsaw Pact and associated nations such as Cuba, and adopted a Marxist\u2013Leninist ideology; ZANU meanwhile aligned itself with Maoism and the bloc headed by the People's Republic of China. Smith declared Rhodesia a republic in 1970, following the results of a referendum the previous year, but this went unrecognised internationally. Meanwhile, Rhodesia's internal conflict intensified, eventually forcing him to open negotiations with the militant communists.\nIn March 1978, Smith reached an accord with three African leaders, led by Bishop Abel Muzorewa, who offered to leave the white population comfortably entrenched in exchange for the establishment of a biracial democracy. As a result of the Internal Settlement, elections were held in April 1979, concluding with the United African National Council (UANC) carrying a majority of parliamentary seats. On 1 June 1979, Muzorewa, the UANC head, became prime minister and the country's name was changed to Zimbabwe Rhodesia. The Internal Settlement left control of the Rhodesian Security Forces, civil service, judiciary, and a third of parliament seats to whites. On 12 June, the United States Senate voted to lift economic pressure on the former Rhodesia.\nFollowing the fifth Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, held in Lusaka, Zambia, from 1 to 7 August in 1979, the British government invited Muzorewa, Mugabe, and Nkomo to participate in a constitutional conference at Lancaster House. The purpose of the conference was to discuss and reach an agreement on the terms of an independence constitution, and provide for elections supervised under British authority allowing Zimbabwe Rhodesia to proceed to legal independence. With Lord Carrington, Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs of the United Kingdom, in the chair, these discussions were mounted from 10 September to 15 December in 1979, producing a total of 47 plenary sessions. On 21 December 1979, delegations from every major interest represented reached the Lancaster House Agreement, effectively ending the guerrilla war. Under the terms of the agreement, the country would temporarily revert to British rule until an election could be conducted, after which it would be granted independence under black majority rule.\nOn 11 December 1979, the Rhodesian House of Assembly voted 90 to nil to revert to British colonial status. With the arrival of Christopher Soames, the new governor on 12 December 1979, Britain formally took control of Zimbabwe Rhodesia as the Colony of Southern Rhodesia. Britain lifted sanctions on 12 December and the United Nations on 16 December. During the 1980 Southern Rhodesian general election, Mugabe and the ZANU party secured a landslide victory. On 11 April 1980, Southern Rhodesia became the independent nation of Zimbabwe. Prince Charles, as the representative of Britain, formally granted independence to Zimbabwe in a ceremony.\nIndependence era (1980\u2013present).\nZimbabwe's first president after its independence was Canaan Banana in what was originally a mainly ceremonial role as head of state. Mugabe was the country's first prime minister and head of government. In 1980, Samora Machel told Mugabe that Zimbabwe was the \"Jewel of Africa\" but added: \"Don't tarnish it!\".\nNew names for 32 places were gazetted on 18 April 1982 and by February 1984, there had been 42 changes, which included three rivers (Umniati/Munyati; Lundi/Runde; Nuanetsi/Mwenezi), and several changes from colonial names (such as Salisbury/Harare; Enkeldoorn/Chivhu; Essexvale/Esigodini; Fort Victoria/Masvingo)\nOpposition to what was perceived as a Shona takeover immediately erupted around Matabeleland. The Matabele unrest led to what has become known as \"Gukurahundi\" (Shona: 'the early rain which washes away the chaff before the spring rains'). The Fifth Brigade, a North Korean-trained elite unit that reported directly to Mugabe, entered Matabeleland and massacred thousands of civilians accused of supporting \"dissidents\". Estimates for the number of deaths during the five-year \"Gukurahundi\" campaign ranged from 3,750 to 80,000. Thousands of others were tortured in military internment camps. The campaign officially ended in 1987 after Nkomo and Mugabe reached a unity agreement that merged their respective parties, creating the Zimbabwe African National Union \u2013 Patriotic Front (ZANU\u2013PF). Elections in March 1990 resulted in another victory for Mugabe and the ZANU\u2013PF party, which claimed 117 of the 120 contested seats.\nDuring the 1990s, students, trade unionists, and other workers often demonstrated to express their growing discontent with Mugabe and ZANU\u2013PF party policies. In 1996, civil servants, nurses, and junior doctors went on strike over salary issues. The general health of the population also began to significantly decline; by 1997 an estimated 25% of the population had been infected by HIV in a pandemic that was affecting most of southern Africa. Land redistribution re-emerged as the main issue for the ZANU\u2013PF government around 1997. Despite the existence of a \"willing-buyer-willing-seller\" land reform programme since the 1980s, the minority white Zimbabwean population continued to hold the majority of the country's most fertile agricultural land.\nIn 2000, the government pressed ahead with its Fast Track Land Reform programme, a policy involving compulsory land acquisition aimed at redistributing land from the minority white population to the majority black population. Confiscations of white farmland, continuous droughts, and a serious drop in external finance and other support led to a sharp decline in agricultural exports, which were traditionally the country's leading export-producing sector. Some 58,000 independent black farmers have since experienced limited success in reviving the gutted cash crop sectors through efforts on a smaller scale.\nPresident Mugabe and the ZANU\u2013PF party leadership found themselves beset by a wide range of international sanctions. In 2002, the nation was suspended from the Commonwealth of Nations due to the reckless farm seizures and blatant election tampering. The following year, Zimbabwean officials voluntarily terminated its Commonwealth membership. In 2001, the United States enacted the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act (ZDERA). It came into effect in 2002 and froze credit to the Zimbabwean government.\nBy 2003, the country's economy had collapsed. It is estimated that up to a quarter of Zimbabwe's 11 million people had fled the country. Three-quarters of the remaining Zimbabweans were living on less than one U.S. dollar a day. Following elections in 2005, the government initiated \"Operation Murambatsvina\", an effort to crack down on illegal markets and slums emerging in towns and cities, leaving a substantial section of urban poor homeless. The Zimbabwean government has described the operation as an attempt to provide decent housing to the population, although according to critics such as Amnesty International, authorities have yet to properly substantiate their claims.\nOn 29 March 2008, Zimbabwe held a presidential election along with a parliamentary election. The results of this election were withheld for two weeks, after which it was generally acknowledged that the Movement for Democratic Change \u2013 Tsvangirai (MDC-T) had achieved a majority of one seat in the lower house of parliament. In September 2008, a power-sharing agreement was reached between Morgan Tsvangirai and President Mugabe, permitting the former to hold the office of prime minister. Due to ministerial differences between their respective political parties, the agreement was not fully implemented until 13 February 2009. By December 2010, Mugabe was threatening to completely expropriate remaining privately owned companies in Zimbabwe unless \"western sanctions\" were lifted.\nIn late 2008, problems in Zimbabwe reached crisis proportions in the areas of living standards, public health (with a major cholera outbreak in December) and various basic affairs. During this period, NGOs took over from government as a primary provider of food during this period of food insecurity in Zimbabwe. A 2011 survey by Freedom House suggested that living conditions had improved since the power-sharing agreement. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs stated in its 2012\u20132013 planning document that the \"humanitarian situation has improved in Zimbabwe since 2009, but conditions remain precarious for many people\".\nA new constitution approved in the Zimbabwean constitutional referendum, 2013 curtails presidential powers. Mugabe was re-elected president in the July 2013 Zimbabwean general election which \"The Economist\" described as \"rigged\" and the \"Daily Telegraph\" as \"stolen\". The Movement for Democratic Change alleged massive fraud and tried to seek relief through the courts. In a surprising moment of candour at the ZANU\u2013PF congress in December 2014, President Robert Mugabe accidentally let slip that the opposition had in fact won the contentious 2008 polls by an astounding 73%. After winning the election, the Mugabe ZANU\u2013PF government re-instituted one party rule, doubled the civil service and, according to \"The Economist\", embarked on \"misrule and dazzling corruption\". A 2017 study conducted by the Institute for Security Studies (ISS) concluded that due to the deterioration of government and the economy \"the government encourages corruption to make up for its inability to fund its own institutions\" with widespread and informal police roadblocks to issue fines to travellers being one manifestation of this.\nIn July 2016, nationwide protests took place regarding the economic collapse in the country. In November 2017, the army led a coup d'\u00e9tat following the dismissal of Vice-president Emmerson Mnangagwa, placing Mugabe under house arrest. The army denied that their actions constituted a coup. On 19 November 2017, ZANU\u2013PF sacked Robert Mugabe as party leader and appointed former Vice-president Emmerson Mnangagwa in his place. On 21 November 2017, Mugabe tendered his resignation prior to impeachment proceedings being completed. Although under the Constitution of Zimbabwe Mugabe should be succeeded by Vice-president Phelekezela Mphoko, a supporter of Grace Mugabe, ZANU\u2013PF chief whip Lovemore Matuke stated to the Reuters news agency that Mnangagwa would be appointed as president.\nOn 30 July 2018, Zimbabwe held its general elections, which were won by the ZANU-PF party led by Mnangagwa. Nelson Chamisa who was leading the main opposition party MDC Alliance contested the election results claiming voter fraud, and subsequently filed a petition to the Constitution Court of Zimbabwe. The court confirmed Mnangagwa's victory, making him the newly elected president after Mugabe.\nIn December 2017, the website Zimbabwe News, calculating the cost of the Mugabe era using various statistics, said that at the time of independence in 1980, the country was growing economically at about five per cent a year, and had done so for quite a long time. If this rate of growth had been maintained for the next 37 years, Zimbabwe would have, in 2016, a GDP of US$52 billion. Instead it had a formal sector GDP of only US$14 billion, a cost of US$38 billion in lost growth. The population growth in 1980 was among the highest in Africa at about 3.5 per cent per annum, doubling every 21 years. Had this growth been maintained, the population would have been 31 million. Instead, as of 2018, it is about 13 million. The discrepancies were believed to be partly caused by death from starvation and disease, and partly due to decreased fertility. The life expectancy has halved, and deaths from politically motivated violence sponsored by the government exceed 200,000 since 1980. The Mugabe government has directly or indirectly caused the deaths of at least three million Zimbabweans in 37 years. According to the World Food Programme, over two million people are facing starvation because of the recent droughts the country is going through.\nIn 2018, President Mnangagwa announced that his government would seek to rejoin the Commonwealth, which is as of 2023 conducting a fact-finding mission prior to asking the Secretary-General to issue a recommendation.\nIn August 2023, President Emmerson Mnangagwa won a second term in an outcome of the election rejected by the opposition and questioned by observers. In September 2023, Zimbabwe signed control over almost 20% of the country's land to the carbon offset company Blue Carbon.\nGeography.\nZimbabwe is a landlocked country in southern Africa, lying between latitudes 15\u00b0 and 23\u00b0S, and longitudes 25\u00b0 and 34\u00b0E. It is bordered by South Africa to the south, Botswana to the west and southwest, Zambia to the northwest, and Mozambique to the east and northeast. Its northwest corner is roughly 150 meters from Namibia, nearly forming a four-nation quadripoint. Most of the country is elevated, consisting of a central plateau (high veld) stretching from the southwest northwards with altitudes between 1,000 and 1,600 m. The country's extreme east is mountainous, this area being known as the Eastern Highlands, with Mount Nyangani as the highest point at 2,592 m.\nThe highlands are known for their natural environment, with tourist destinations such as Nyanga, Troutbeck, Chimanimani, Vumba and Chirinda Forest at Mount Selinda. About 20% of the country consists of low-lying areas, (the low veld) under 900m. Victoria Falls, one of the world's largest and most spectacular waterfalls, is located in the country's extreme northwest and is part of the Zambezi river.\nGeology.\nOver geological time, Zimbabwe has experienced two major post-Gondwana erosion cycles (known as African and post-African), and a very subordinate Plio-Pleistocene cycle.\nClimate.\nZimbabwe has a subtropical climate with many local variations. The southern areas are known for their heat and aridity, while parts of the central plateau receive frost in winter. The Zambezi valley is known for its extreme heat, and the Eastern Highlands usually experience cool temperatures and the highest rainfall in the country. The country's rainy season generally runs from late October to March, and the hot climate is moderated by increasing altitude. Zimbabwe is faced with recurring droughts. In 2019, at least 55 elephants died because of drought. Severe storms are rare.\nBiodiversity.\nZimbabwe contains seven terrestrial ecoregions: Kalahari acacia\u2013baikiaea woodlands, Southern Africa bushveld, Southern miombo woodlands, Zambezian Baikiaea woodlands, Zambezian and mopane woodlands, Zambezian halophytics, and Eastern Zimbabwe montane forest-grassland mosaic in the Eastern Highlands.\nThe country is mostly savanna, although the moist and mountainous Eastern Highlands support areas of tropical evergreen and hardwood forests. Trees found in the Eastern Highlands include teak, mahogany, enormous specimens of strangler fig, forest Newtonia, big leaf, white stinkwood, chirinda stinkwood, knobthorn and many others.\nIn the low-lying parts of the country fever trees, mopane, combretum and baobabs abound. Much of the country is covered by miombo woodland, dominated by brachystegia species and others. Among the numerous flowers and shrubs are hibiscus, flame lily, snake lily, spider lily, leonotis, cassia, tree wisteria and dombeya. There are around 350 species of mammals that can be found in Zimbabwe. There are also many snakes and lizards, over 500 bird species, and 131 fish species.\nLarge parts of Zimbabwe were once covered by forests with abundant wildlife. Deforestation and poaching has reduced the amount of wildlife. Woodland degradation and deforestation caused by population growth, urban expansion and use for fuel are major concerns and have led to erosion which diminishes the amount of fertile soil. Local farmers have been criticised by environmentalists for burning off vegetation to heat their tobacco barns. \nGovernment and politics.\nZimbabwe is a republic with a presidential system of government. The semi-presidential system was abolished with the adoption of a new constitution after a referendum in 2013. Under the constitutional changes in 2005, an upper chamber, the Senate, was reinstated. The House of Assembly is the lower chamber of Parliament.\nIn 1987, Mugabe revised the constitution, abolishing the ceremonial presidency and the prime ministerial posts to form an executive president\u2014a presidential system. His ZANU-PF party has won every election since independence\u2014in the 1990 election, the second-placed party, Edgar Tekere's Zimbabwe Unity Movement (ZUM), obtained 20% of the vote.\nPolitics.\nDuring the 1995 parliamentary elections, most opposition parties, including the ZUM, boycotted the voting, resulting in a near sweep by the ruling party. When the opposition returned to the polls in 2000, they won 57 seats, only five fewer than ZANU-PF. Presidential elections were again held in 2002 amid allegations of vote-rigging, intimidation and fraud. The 2005 Zimbabwe parliamentary elections were held on 31 March, and multiple claims of vote rigging, election fraud and intimidation were made by the Movement for Democratic Change party and Jonathan Moyo, calling for investigations into 32 of the 120 constituencies. Moyo participated in the elections despite the allegations and won a seat as an independent member of Parliament.\nIn 2005, the MDC split into two factions: the Movement for Democratic Change \u2013 Mutambara (MDC-M), led by Arthur Mutambara which contested the elections to the Senate, and the Movement for Democratic Change \u2013 Tsvangirai (MDC-T) led by Morgan Tsvangirai which was opposed to contesting the elections, stating that participation in a rigged election is tantamount to endorsing Mugabe's claim that past elections were free and fair. The two MDC camps had their congresses in 2006, with Tsvangirai being elected to lead MDC-T, which became more popular than the other group.\nIn the 2008 general election, the official results required a run-off between Mugabe and Tsvangirai. The MDC-T challenged these results, claiming widespread election fraud by the Mugabe government. The run-off was scheduled for 27 June 2008. On 22 June, citing the continuing unfairness of the process and refusing to participate in a \"violent, illegitimate sham of an election process\", Tsvangirai pulled out of the presidential run-off, the election commission held the run-off, and President Mugabe received a landslide majority. The MDC-T did not participate in the Senate elections, while the MDC-M won five seats in the Senate. The MDC-M was weakened by defections from members of parliament and individuals who were disillusioned by their manifesto. On 28 April 2008, Tsvangirai and Mutambara announced at a joint news conference in Johannesburg that the two MDC formations were co-operating, enabling the MDC to have a clear parliamentary majority. Tsvangirai said that Mugabe could not remain president without a parliamentary majority.\nIn mid-September 2008, after protracted negotiations overseen by the leaders of South Africa and Mozambique, Mugabe and Tsvangirai signed a power-sharing deal in which Mugabe retained control over the army. Donor nations adopted a 'wait-and-see' attitude, wanting to see real change being brought about by this merger before committing themselves to funding rebuilding efforts, which were estimated to take at least five years. On 11 February 2009, Tsvangirai was sworn in as prime minister by Mugabe.\nIn November 2008, the government of Zimbabwe spent US$7.3 million donated by The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. A representative of the organisation declined to speculate on how the money was spent, except that it was not for the intended purpose, and the government has failed to honour requests to return the money.\nThe status of Zimbabwe politics has been thrown into question by a coup taking place in November 2017, ending Mugabe's 30-year presidential incumbency. Emmerson Mnangagwa was appointed president following this coup and was officially elected with 50.8% of the vote in the 2018 Zimbabwean general election, avoiding a run-off and making him the third president of Zimbabwe.\nThe government has received negative comments among its citizens for always shutting down the internet in the past amid protests such as the one planned on 31 July 2020.\nIn July 2023, Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa voiced support for the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nArmed forces.\nThe Zimbabwe Defence Forces were set up by unifying three insurrectionist forces \u2013 the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA), the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA), and the Rhodesian Security Forces (RSF) \u2013 after the Second Chimurenga and Zimbabwean independence in 1980. The integration period saw the formation of the Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) and Air Force of Zimbabwe (AFZ) as separate entities under the command of General Solomon Mujuru and Air Marshal Norman Walsh, who retired in 1982 and was replaced by Air Marshal Azim Daudpota who handed over command to Air Chief Marshal Josiah Tungamirai in 1985. In 2003, General Constantine Chiwenga, was promoted and appointed Commander of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces. Lieutenant General P. V. Sibanda replaced him as Commander of the Army.\nThe ZNA has an active duty strength of 30,000. The Air Force has about 5,139 standing personnel. The Zimbabwe Republic Police (includes Police Support Unit, Paramilitary Police) is part of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces and numbers 25,000.\nFollowing majority rule in early 1980, British Army trainers oversaw the integration of guerrilla fighters into a battalion structure overlaid on the existing Rhodesian armed forces. For the first year, a system was followed where the top-performing candidate became battalion commander. If he or she was from ZANLA, then his or her second-in-command was the top-performing ZIPRA candidate, and vice versa. This ensured a balance between the two movements in the command structure.\nThe ZNA was originally formed into four brigades, composed of a total of 28 battalions. The brigade support units were composed almost entirely of specialists of the former Rhodesian Army, while unintegrated battalions of the Rhodesian African Rifles were assigned to the 1st, 3rd and 4th Brigades. The Fifth Brigade was formed in 1981 and disbanded in 1988 after the demonstration of mass brutality and murder during the brigade's occupation of Matabeleland in what became known as \"Gukurahundi\". The brigade had been re-formed by 2006, with its commander, Brigadier General John Mupande praising its \"rich history\".\nHuman rights.\nThere are widespread reports of systematic and escalating violations of human rights in Zimbabwe under the Mugabe administration and the dominant ZANU\u2013PF party. According to human rights organisations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch the government of Zimbabwe violates the rights to shelter, food, freedom of movement and residence, freedom of assembly and the protection of the law. In 2009, Gregory Stanton, president of the International Association of Genocide Scholars, stated there was \"clear evidence that Mugabe government was guilty of crimes against humanity and that there was sufficient evidence of crimes against humanity to bring Mugabe to trial in front of the International Criminal Court.\"\nMale homosexuality is illegal in Zimbabwe. From 1995, the government carried out campaigns against both homosexual men and women. President Mugabe blamed gays for many of Zimbabwe's problems and viewed homosexuality as an \"un-African\" and immoral culture brought by European colonists and practised by only \"a few whites\" in his country.\nOpposition gatherings are frequently the subject of reprisals by the police force, such as the crackdown on an 11 March 2007 MDC rally and several others during the 2008 election campaign. Police actions have been strongly condemned by the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, the European Union, and the United States. There are also concerns over Fox Southwest media rights and access. The Zimbabwean government is accused of suppressing freedom of the press and freedom of speech. It has been repeatedly accused of using the public broadcaster, the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation, as a propaganda tool. Newspapers critical of the government, such as the \"Daily News\", closed after bombs exploded at their offices and the government refused to renew their licence. BBC News, Sky News, and CNN were banned from filming or reporting from Zimbabwe. In 2009, reporting restrictions on the BBC and CNN were lifted. Sky News continues to report on happenings within Zimbabwe from neighbouring countries like South Africa.\nOn 24 July 2020, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) expressed concerns over allegations suggesting that Zimbabwean authorities may have used the COVID-19 crisis as a pretext to suppress freedom of expression and peaceful assembly on the streets. OHCHR spokesperson Liz Throssell stated that people have a right to protest corruption or anything else. The authorities in Zimbabwe used force to disperse and arrest nurses and health workers, who were peacefully protesting for better salaries and work conditions. The reports suggest that a few members of opposition party and investigative journalists were also arbitrarily arrested and detained for taking part in a protest.\nOn 5 August 2020, the #ZimbabweanLivesMatter campaign on Twitter drew attention of international celebrities and politicians towards human rights abuses in the country, mounting pressure on Emmerson Mnangagwa's government. The campaign was in response to arrests, abductions and torture of political activists and the incarceration of journalist Hopewell Chin'ono and the Booker Prize shortlisted author Tsitsi Dangarembga.\nAdministrative divisions.\nZimbabwe has a centralised government and is divided into eight provinces and two cities with provincial status, for administrative purposes. Each province has a provincial capital from where government administration is usually carried out.\nThe names of most of the provinces were generated from the Mashonaland and Matabeleland divide at the time of colonisation: Mashonaland was the territory occupied first by the British South Africa Company Pioneer Column and Matabeleland the territory conquered during the First Matabele War. This corresponds roughly to the precolonial territory of the Shona people and the Matabele people, although there are significant ethnic minorities in most provinces. Each province is headed by a provincial governor, appointed by the president. The provincial government is run by a provincial administrator, appointed by the Public Service Commission. Other government functions at provincial level are carried out by provincial offices of national government departments.\nThe provinces are subdivided into 59 districts and 1,200 wards (sometimes referred to as municipalities). Each district is headed by a district administrator, appointed by the Public Service Commission. There is also a Rural District Council, which appoints a chief executive officer. The Rural District Council is composed of elected ward councillors, the district administrator, and one representative of the chiefs (traditional leaders appointed under customary law) in the district. Other government functions at district level are carried out by district offices of national government departments.\nAt the ward level, there is a Ward Development Committee, comprising the elected ward councillor, the kraalheads (traditional leaders subordinate to chiefs) and representatives of Village Development Committees. Wards are subdivided into villages, each of which has an elected Village Development Committee and a headman (traditional leader subordinate to the kraalhead).\nSanctions.\nSince the early 2000s, Zimbabwe has been under sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union that have shaped Zimbabwe's domestic politics as well as the country's relations with the Western nations. In 2002, Zimbabwe held general elections and ahead of that election the EU sent observers, but the election observer team was forced to leave the country. In February 2002, the EU placed targeted or restrictive measures on Zimbabwe. At least 20 government officials were banned from entering Europe, and EU funding was halted. Prior to the elections, there was $128 million that was budgeted for the Zimbabwean government from 2002 to 2007, this was cancelled. Nevertheless, the EU only stopped funding the government directly but it continued sending money only through aid agencies and NGOs.\nAfter some years, the EU and Zimbabwe resolved some of their disputes and a lot of the EU sanctions were removed. Only Mugabe and his wife remained on the list while other government officials were removed. However, the EU still did not give Zimbabwe money. The government channels money through NGOs as it was seen on 4 March 2019 \u2013 21 March 2019 Cyclone Idai.\nThe United States also imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe. There are two types of U.S. sanctions on Zimbabwe. The first one is Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act (ZIDERA) and the second one is the Targeted Sanctions Program. ZIDERA made several demands, the first one was that Zimbabwe must respect human rights, second Zimbabwe must stop its interference in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, third Zimbabwe must stop the expropriation of white farms. If none of these demands were met, the U.S. would block the IMF and the World Bank from lending money to Zimbabwe. A new ZIDERA came into effect in 2018 with the motto: \"Restore Democracy or there won't be any friendship, there must be free elections, free media and human rights, Zimbabwe must enforce the ruling of the SADC Tribunal\". The Targeted Sanctions Program was implemented in 2003, which lists Zimbabwean companies and people who are not allowed to deal with U.S. companies. The sanctions on Zimbabwe have been in place for more than two decades. In March 2021, the U.S. renewed its sanctions on Zimbabwe.\nEconomy.\nThe main foreign exports of Zimbabwe are minerals, gold, and agriculture. Zimbabwe is crossed by two trans-African automobile routes: the Cairo-Cape Town Highway and the Beira-Lobito Highway. Zimbabwe is the largest trading partner of South Africa on the continent. Taxes and tariffs are high for private enterprises, while state enterprises are strongly subsidised. State regulation is costly to companies; starting or closing a business is slow and expensive. Tourism also plays a key role in the economy but has been failing in recent years. The Zimbabwe Conservation Task Force released a report in June 2007, estimating that 60% of Zimbabwe's wildlife had died since 2000 as a result of poaching and deforestation. The report warns that the loss of life combined with widespread deforestation is potentially disastrous for the tourism industry. The information and communications technology sector has been growing at a fast pace. A report by the mobile web browser company Opera in 2011 ranked Zimbabwe as Africa's fastest growing market.\nSince January 2002, the government has had its lines of credit at international financial institutions frozen, through U.S. legislation called the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act of 2001 (ZDERA). Section 4C instructs the secretary of the treasury to direct international financial institutions to veto the extension of loans and credit to the Zimbabwean government. According to the United States, these sanctions target only seven specific businesses owned or controlled by government officials and not ordinary citizens.\nZimbabwe maintained positive economic growth throughout the 1980s (5% GDP growth per year) and 1990s (4.3% GDP growth per year). The economy declined from 2000: 5% decline in 2000, 8% in 2001, 12% in 2002 and 18% in 2003. Zimbabwe's involvement from 1998 to 2002 in the war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo drained hundreds of millions of dollars from the economy. From 1999 to 2009, Zimbabwe saw the lowest ever economic growth with an annual GDP decrease of 6.1%. The downward spiral of the economy has been attributed mainly to mismanagement and corruption by the government and the eviction of more than 4,000 white farmers in the controversial land confiscations of 2000. The Zimbabwean government and its supporters attest that it was Western policies to avenge the expulsion of their kin that sabotaged the economy.\nBy 2005, the purchasing power of the average Zimbabwean had dropped to the same levels in real terms as 1953. In 2005, the government, led by central bank governor Gideon Gono, started making overtures that white farmers could come back. There were 400 to 500 still left in the country, but much of the land that had been confiscated was no longer productive. By 2016, there remained about 300 of the original 4,500 farms owned by white farmers. The farms that left were either too remote or their owners had paid for protection or collaborated with the regime. In January 2007, the government issued long-term leases to some white farmers. At the same time, however, the government also continued to demand that all remaining white farmers, who were given eviction notices earlier, vacate the land or risk being arrested.&lt;ref name=\"AP/WP-2007-02-05\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Mugabe pointed to foreign governments and alleged \"sabotage\" as the cause of the fall of the Zimbabwean economy, as well as the country's 80% formal unemployment rate.\nInflation rose from an annual rate of 32% in 1998, to an estimated high of 11,200,000% in August 2008 according to the Central Statistical Office. This represented a state of hyperinflation, and the central bank introduced a new 100 trillion dollar note. In January 2009, in an effort to counteract runaway inflation, acting Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa announced that Zimbabweans would be permitted to use other, more stable currencies to do business, alongside the Zimbabwean dollar. In an effort to combat inflation and foster economic growth, the Zimbabwean dollar was suspended indefinitely in April 2009. In 2016, Zimbabwe allowed trade in the United States dollar and various other currencies such as the rand (South Africa), the pula (Botswana), the euro, and the pound sterling (UK). In February 2019, Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe Governor John Mangudya introduced a new local currency, the Real Time Gross Settlement dollar, in a move to address some of the Zimbabwean economic and financial challenges.\nAfter the formation of the Unity Government and the adoption of several currencies instead of the Zimbabwe dollar in 2009, the Zimbabwean economy rebounded. GDP grew by 8\u20139% per year between 2009 and 2012. In November 2010, the International Monetary Fund described the Zimbabwean economy as \"completing its second year of buoyant economic growth\". The pan-African investment bank IMARA released a favourable report in February 2011 on investment prospects in Zimbabwe, citing an improved revenue base and higher tax receipts. In January 2013, the finance ministry reported that they had only $217 in their treasury and would apply for donations to finance the coming elections. By 2014, Zimbabwe had recovered to levels seen in the 1990s but growth faltered between 2012 and 2016. Inflation was 42% in 2018; in June 2019, the inflation rate reached 175%, leading to mass unrest across the country.\nMinerals.\nThe mining sector is lucrative, with some of the world's largest platinum reserves being mined by Anglo American plc, Zimplats, and Impala Platinum. Zimplats, the nation's largest platinum company, has proceeded with US$500\u00a0million in expansions, and is also continuing a separate US$2 billion project, despite threats by Mugabe to nationalise the company.\nThe Marange diamond fields, discovered in 2006, are considered the biggest diamond find in over a century. They have the potential to improve the fiscal situation of the country considerably, but almost all revenues from the field have disappeared into the pockets of army officers and ZANU\u2013PF politicians. In terms of carats produced, the Marange field is one of the largest diamond-producing projects in the world, estimated to have produced 12\u00a0million carats in 2014 worth over $350\u00a0million.\nAs of \u00a02014[ [update]], Metallon Corporation was Zimbabwe's largest gold miner. In 2015, Zimbabwe's gold production is 20 metric tonnes. \nAgriculture.\nZimbabwe's commercial farming sector was traditionally a source of exports and foreign exchange and provided 400,000 jobs. However, the government's land reform program badly damaged the sector, turning Zimbabwe into a net importer of food products. For example, between 2000 and 2016, annual wheat production fell from 250,000 tons to 60,000 tons, maize was reduced from two million tons to 500,000 tons and cattle slaughtered for beef fell from 605,000 head to 244,000 head. Coffee production, once a prized export commodity, came to a virtual halt after seizure or expropriation of white-owned coffee farms in 2000 and has never recovered.\nFor the past ten years, the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics has been assisting Zimbabwe's farmers to adopt conservation agriculture techniques, a sustainable method of farming that can help increase yields. By applying the three principles of minimum soil disturbance, legume-based cropping and the use of organic mulch, farmers can improve infiltration, reduce evaporation and soil erosion, and build up organic soil content. Between 2005 and 2011, the number of smallholders practicing conservation agriculture in Zimbabwe increased from 5,000 to more than 150,000. Cereal yields rose between 15 and 100 per cent across different regions. The government declared potato a national strategic food security crop in 2012.\nTourism.\nSince the land reform programme in 2000, tourism in Zimbabwe has steadily declined. In 2018, tourism peaked with 2.6\u00a0million tourists. In 2016, the total contribution of tourism to Zimbabwe was $1.1 billion (USD), or about 8.1% of Zimbabwe's GDP. Employment in travel and tourism, as well as the industries indirectly supported by travel and tourism, was 5.2% of national employment.\nSeveral airlines pulled out of Zimbabwe between 2000 and 2007. Australia's Qantas, Germany's Lufthansa, and Austrian Airlines were among the first to pull out and in 2007 British Airways suspended all direct flights to Harare. The country's flagship airline, Air Zimbabwe, which operated flights throughout Africa and a few destinations in Europe and Asia, ceased operations in February 2012. As of 2017, several major commercial airlines had resumed flights to Zimbabwe.\nZimbabwe has several major tourist attractions. Victoria Falls on the Zambezi, which are shared with Zambia, are located in the north-west of Zimbabwe. Victoria Falls is considered to be the largest waterfall in the world. Before the economic changes, much of the tourism for these locations came to the Zimbabwe side, but now Zambia is the main beneficiary. The Victoria Falls National Park is also in this area and is one of the eight main national parks in Zimbabwe, the largest of which is Hwange National Park. Lake Kariba, another site for tourism, is the largest reservoir in the world.\nThe Eastern Highlands are a series of mountainous areas near the border with Mozambique. The highest peak in Zimbabwe, Mount Nyangani at is located there as well as the Bvumba Mountains and the Nyanga National Park. World's View is in these mountains, and it is from here that places as far away as are visible and, on clear days, the town of Rusape can be seen.\nZimbabwe is unusual in Africa in that there are a number of ancient and medieval ruined cities built in a unique dry stone style. Among the most famous of these are the Great Zimbabwe ruins in Masvingo. Other ruins include Khami, Dhlo-Dhlo and Naletale. The Matobo Hills are an area of granite kopjes and wooded valleys commencing some south of Bulawayo in southern Zimbabwe. The hills were formed over two billion years ago with granite being forced to the surface, then being eroded to produce smooth \"whaleback dwalas\" and broken kopjes, strewn with boulders and interspersed with thickets of vegetation. Mzilikazi, founder of the Ndebele nation, gave the area its name, meaning 'Bald Heads'. They have become a tourist attraction because of their ancient shapes and local wildlife. Cecil Rhodes and other early white colonists like Leander Starr Jameson are buried in these hills at World's View.\nWater supply and sanitation.\nThere are many successful small-scale water supply and sanitation programs, but there is an overall lack of improved water and sanitation systems for the majority of Zimbabwe. According to the World Health Organization in 2012, 80% of Zimbabweans had access to improved (i.e. clean) drinking water sources, and only 40% of Zimbabweans had access to improved sanitation facilities. Access to improved water supply and sanitation is noticeably limited in rural areas. There are many factors that continue to determine the nature of water supply and sanitation in Zimbabwe for the foreseeable future; three major factors are the severely depressed state of the Zimbabwean economy, the reluctance of foreign aid organisations to build and finance infrastructure projects, and the political instability of the state.\nScience and technology.\nZimbabwe has relatively well-developed national infrastructure and a long-standing tradition of promoting research and development, as evidenced by the levy imposed on tobacco-growers since the 1930s to promote market research. The country has a well-developed education system, with one in 11 adults holding a tertiary degree. Given the country's solid knowledge base and abundant natural resources, Zimbabwe has great growth potential. Zimbabwe was ranked 129th in the Global Innovation Index in 2025\nTo achieve its growth potential, Zimbabwe will need to correct several structural weaknesses. For instance, it lacks the critical mass of researchers needed to trigger innovation. Although the infrastructure is in place to harness research and development to Zimbabwe's socio-economic development, universities and research institutions lack the financial and human resources to conduct research and the regulatory environment hampers the transfer of new technologies to the business sector. The economic crisis has precipitated an exodus of university students and professionals in key areas of expertise (medicine, engineering, etc.) that is of growing concern. More than 22% of Zimbabwean tertiary students were completing their degrees abroad in 2012, compared to a 4% average for sub-Saharan Africa as a whole. In 2012, there were 200 researchers (head count) employed in the public sector, one-quarter of whom were women. This is double the continental average (91 in 2013) but only one-quarter the researcher density of South Africa (818 per million inhabitants). The government has created the Zimbabwe Human Capital Website to provide information for the diaspora on job and investment opportunities in Zimbabwe.\nThe country's \"Second Science and Technology Policy\" was launched in June 2012, after being elaborated with UNESCO assistance. It replaces the earlier policy dating from 2002. The 2012 policy prioritizes biotechnology, information and communication technologies (ICTs), space sciences, nanotechnology, indigenous knowledge systems, technologies yet to emerge and scientific solutions to emergent environmental challenges. The \"Second Science and Technology Policy\" also asserts the government's commitment to allocating at least 1% of GDP to research and development, focusing at least 60% of university education on developing skills in science and technology and ensuring that school pupils devote at least 30% of their time to studying science subjects.\nIn 2014, Zimbabwe counted 21 publications per million inhabitants in internationally cataloged journals, according to Thomson Reuters' Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded). This placed Zimbabwe sixth out of the 15 SADC countries, behind Namibia (59), Mauritius (71), Botswana (103) and, above all, South Africa (175) and the Seychelles (364). The average for sub-Saharan Africa was 20 scientific publications per million inhabitants, compared to a global average of 176 per million.\nDemographics.\nPopulation.\nExpanding from a population of 2,746,396 in 1950, Zimbabwe's population has rapidly increased. Based on , the population of Zimbabwe was estimated by the United Nations at in .\nEthnic groups.\nAccording to the 2022 census report, 99.6% of the population is of African origin. The majority people, the Shona, comprise 82%, while Ndebele make up 14% of the population. The Ndebele descended from Zulu migrations in the 19th century and the other tribes with which they intermarried. Up to one million Ndebele may have left the country over the last five years, mainly for South Africa. Other ethnic groups include Venda, Tonga, Tsonga, Kalanga, Sotho, Ndau, Nambya, Tswana, Xhosa and Lozi.\nMinority ethnic groups include white Zimbabweans, who make up less than 1% of the total population. White Zimbabweans are mostly of British origin, but there are also Afrikaner, Greek, Portuguese, French and Dutch communities. The white population dropped from a peak of around 278,000, or 4.3% of the population, in 1975. The 2022 census lists the total white population at 24,888 (roughly 0.16% of the population), one-eleventh of its peak. Emigrants went to the United Kingdom (between 200,000 and 500,000 resident Britons were of Rhodesian or Zimbabwean origin in 2006), South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Hong Kong, the United States, Zambia and Mozambique. After Mugabe was replaced by Emmerson Mnangagwa as president, there was an influx of white Zimbabweans returning to the country.\nColoureds form 0.1% of the population, and various Asian ethnic groups, mostly of Indian and Chinese origin, are 0.04%.\nLargest cities.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Largest_cities/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLanguages.\nZimbabwe has 16 official languages and under the constitution, an Act of Parliament may prescribe other languages as officially recognised languages. English is the main language used in the education and judicial systems. The Bantu languages Shona and Ndebele are the principal indigenous languages of Zimbabwe. Shona is spoken by 78% of the population, Ndebele by 20%. Other minority Bantu languages include Venda, Tsonga, Shangaan, Kalanga, Sotho, Ndau and Nambya. Less than 2.5%, mainly the white and \"coloured\" (mixed race) minorities, consider English their native language. Shona has a rich oral tradition, which was incorporated into the first Shona novel, \"Feso\" by Solomon Mutswairo, published in 1956. English is primarily spoken in the cities but less so in rural areas. Radio and television news are broadcast in Shona, Sindebele and English.\nThere is a large community of Portuguese speakers in Zimbabwe, mainly in the border areas with Mozambique and in major cities. Beginning in 2017, teaching Portuguese was included in secondary education of Zimbabwe.\nReligion.\nAccording to the 2017 Inter Censal Demography Survey by the Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency, 84% of Zimbabweans are Christian, 10% do not belong to any religion, and 0.7% are Muslim. An estimated 62% of the population attend religious services regularly. Approximately 69% of Zimbabweans belong to Protestant Christianity, while 8% are Roman Catholic. Pentecostal-charismatic forms of Christianity, in particular, have grown rapidly in recent years and are playing a prominent role in public, social and political life. The largest Christian churches are Anglican, Roman Catholic, Seventh-day Adventist and Methodist.\nAs in other African countries, Christianity may be mixed with enduring traditional beliefs. Indigenous religion, which predates colonialism, has become relatively marginal but continues to be an important part of the Zimbabwean religious field. Ancestral worship is the most practised non-Christian religion, involving spiritual intercession. Central to many ceremonial proceedings is the mbira dzavadzimu, meaning \"voice of the ancestors\", which is an instrument related to many lamellophones ubiquitous throughout Africa.\nHealth.\nAt independence, the policies of racial inequality were reflected in the disease patterns of the black majority. The first five years after independence saw rapid gains in areas such as immunisation coverage, access to health care, and contraceptive prevalence rate. Zimbabwe was thus considered internationally to have achieved a good record of health development.\nZimbabwe suffered occasional outbreaks of acute diseases. The gains on the national health were eroded by structural adjustment in the 1990s, the impact of the HIV/AIDS pandemic and the economic crisis since 2000. In 2006, Zimbabwe had one of the lowest life expectancies in the world according to UN figure\u201444 for men and 43 for women, down from 60 in 1990, but recovered to 60 in 2015. The rapid drop was ascribed mainly to the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Infant mortality rose from 6% in the late 1990s to 12.3% by 2004. Official fertility rates over the last decade were 3.6 (2002), 3.8 (2006) and 3.8 (2012). The 2014 maternal mortality rate per 100,000 births for Zimbabwe was 614 compared to 960 in 2010\u201311 and 232 in 1990. The under five mortality rate, per 1,000 births was 75 in 2014 (94 in 2009). The number of midwives per 1,000 live births was unavailable in 2016 and the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women 1 in 42.\nIn 2006 an association of doctors in Zimbabwe made calls for Mugabe to make moves to assist the ailing health service. The HIV infection rate in Zimbabwe was estimated to be 14% for people aged 15\u201349 in 2009. UNESCO reported a decline in HIV prevalence among pregnant women from 26% in 2002 to 21% in 2004. By 2016 HIV/AIDS prevalence had been reduced to 13.5% compared to 40% in 1998.\nAt the end of November 2008, some operations at three of Zimbabwe's four major referral hospitals had shut down, along with the Zimbabwe Medical School, and the fourth major hospital had two wards and no operating theatres working. Those hospitals still open were not able to obtain basic drugs and medicines. The situation changed drastically after the Unity Government and the introduction of the multi-currency system in February 2009 although the political and economic crisis also contributed to the emigration of the doctors and people with medical knowledge.\nIn August 2008 large areas of Zimbabwe were struck by the ongoing cholera epidemic. By December 2008 more than 10,000 people had been infected in all but one of Zimbabwe's provinces, and the outbreak had spread to Botswana, Mozambique, South Africa and Zambia. On 4 December 2008 the Zimbabwe government declared the outbreak to be a national emergency and asked for international aid. By 9 March 2009 The World Health Organization estimated that 4,011 people had succumbed to the waterborne disease since the outbreak began, and the total number of cases recorded had reached 89,018. In Harare, the city council offered free graves to cholera victims.\nEducation.\nLarge investments in education since independence has resulted in the highest adult literacy rate in Africa which in 2013 was 90.70%. This is lower than the 92% recorded in 2010 by the United Nations Development Programme and the 97.0% recorded in the 2002 census, while still substantially higher than 80.4% recorded in the 1992 census.\nThe wealthier portion of the population usually send their children to independent schools as opposed to the government-run schools which are attended by the majority as these are subsidised by the government. School education was made free in 1980, but since 1988, the government has steadily increased the charges attached to school enrolment until they now greatly exceed the real value of fees in 1980. The Ministry of Education of Zimbabwe maintains and operates the government schools, but the fees charged by independent schools are regulated by the cabinet of Zimbabwe. The education department has stated that 20,000 teachers have left Zimbabwe since 2007 and that half of Zimbabwe's children have not progressed beyond primary school. Education came under threat since the economic changes in 2000, with teachers going on strike because of low pay, students unable to concentrate because of hunger, and the price of uniforms soaring making this standard a luxury. Teachers were also one of the main targets of Mugabe's attacks because he thought they were not strong supporters.\nZimbabwe's education system consists of two years of pre-school, seven years of primary and six years of secondary schooling before students can enter university in the country or abroad. The academic year in Zimbabwe runs from January to December, with three terms, separated by one-month breaks, with a total of 40 weeks of school per year. National examinations are written during the third term in November, with \"O\" level and \"A\" level subjects also offered in June.\nThere are seven public (government) universities as well as four church-related universities in Zimbabwe that are internationally accredited. The University of Zimbabwe, the first and largest, was built in 1952 and is located in the Harare suburb of Mount Pleasant. Notable alumni from Zimbabwean universities include Welshman Ncube, Peter Moyo, Tendai Biti, Chenjerai Hove and Arthur Mutambara. Many of the politicians in the government of Zimbabwe have obtained degrees from universities in the United States or other universities abroad.\nNational University of Science and Technology is the second largest public research university in Zimbabwe located in Bulawayo. It was established in 1991. The National University of Science and Technology strives to become a flourishing and reputable institution not only in Zimbabwe and in Southern Africa but also among the international fraternity of universities. Africa University is a United Methodist university in Manicaland which attracts students from at least 36 African countries.\nGender equality.\nWomen in Zimbabwe are disadvantaged in many facets including economic, political, and social spheres, and experience sex and gender based violence. A 2014 UN report found that deep rooted cultural issues, patriarchal attitudes, and religious practices negatively impacted women's rights and freedoms in the country. These negative views toward women as well as societal norms impact the incentive for women to participate in the economy and hinder their economic production. Zimbabwe's constitution has provisions in it that provide incentive to achieve greater gender equality, but the data shows that enforcement has been lax and adoption slow. In December 2016 the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies conducted a case study to determine how to best implement effective policy to address issues such as gender violence and implementation of equality laws. It was found that sex and gender based violence against women and girls was increasing in areas that had experienced disasters (floods, drought, disease) but could not quantify the extent of the increase. Some of the obstacles in combating these issues are that there are economic barriers to declaring sex and gender based violence to be unacceptable as well as social barriers. Additionally, governmental services which were installed to help educate the populace about these issues as well as provide services to victims are underfunded and unable to carry out their duties. The UN also provided economic incentive to adopt policies which would discourage these practices which negatively impacted women in Zimbabwe.\nWomen are often seen as inferior, treated as objects, and viewed in subordinate roles in history and philosophy. Ubuntu, an African philosophy's spiritual aspect, instills the belief that boys should be more valued than girls as boys pass on lineage, and the belief system places high value in respecting one's ancestors. A common expression used in court, \"\"vakadzi ngavanyarare\", translates to \"women should keep quiet,\"\" and as a result women are not consulted in decision-making; they must implement the men's wishes. The subordination of women in Zimbabwe, and the cultural forces which dictate what they must be, have led to deaths and the sacrifice of professional advancement in order for them to fulfill their roles as wives, mothers, and subordinates. Women are taught that they must never refuse their husband's sexual advances, even if they know they are infected with HIV from being unfaithful. As a result of this practice, Zimbabwean women aged 15\u201349 have an HIV prevalence rate of 16.1% and make up 62% of the total population infected with HIV in that age group.\nCulture.\nZimbabwe has many different cultures, with Shona beliefs and ceremonies being prominent. The Shona people have many types of sculptures and carvings.\nZimbabwe first celebrated its independence on 18 April 1980. Celebrations are held at either the National Sports Stadium or Rufaro Stadium in Harare. The first independence celebrations were held in 1980 at the Zimbabwe Grounds. At these celebrations, doves are released to symbolise peace, fighter jets fly over, and the national anthem is sung. The flame of independence is lit by the president after parades by the presidential family and members of the armed forces of Zimbabwe. The president also gives a speech to the people of Zimbabwe which is televised for those unable to attend the stadium. Zimbabwe also has a national beauty pageant, the Miss Heritage Zimbabwe contest, which has been held annually since 2012.\nArts.\nTraditional arts in Zimbabwe include pottery, basketry, textiles, jewellery and carving. Among the distinctive qualities are symmetrically patterned woven baskets and stools carved out of a single piece of wood. Shona sculpture, which has a long cultural history, began evolving into its modern form in the mid-20th century and gained increasing international popularity. Most subjects of carved figures of stylised birds and human figures among others are made with sedimentary rock such as soapstone, as well as harder igneous rocks such as serpentine and the rare stone verdite. Zimbabwean artefacts can be found in countries like Singapore, China and Canada\u2014for example, Dominic Benhura's statue in the Singapore Botanic Gardens.\nShona sculpture has survived through the ages, and the modern style is a fusion of African folklore with European influences. World-renowned Zimbabwean sculptors include Nicholas Nesbert and Anderson Mukomberanwa, Tapfuma Gutsa, Henry Munyaradzi and Locardia Ndandarika.\nSeveral authors are well known within Zimbabwe and abroad. Charles Mungoshi is renowned in Zimbabwe for writing traditional stories in English and in Shona, and his poems and books have sold well with both the black and white communities. Catherine Buckle has achieved international recognition with her two books \"African Tears\" and \"Beyond Tears\" which tell of the ordeal she went through under the 2000 Land Reform. The first Prime Minister of Rhodesia, Ian Smith, wrote two books \u2013 \"\" and \".\" The book \"The House of Hunger\" by Dambudzo Marechera won the Guardian Fiction Prize in the UK in 1979. The Nobel Prize-winning author Doris Lessing's first novel \"The Grass Is Singing\" is set in Rhodesia, as are the first four volumes of her \"Children of Violence\" sequence and her collection of short stories entitled \"African Stories\". In 2013 NoViolet Bulawayo's novel \"We Need New Names\" was shortlisted for the Booker Prize. The novel was inspired by a photograph of a child who lost their home in Operation Murambatsvina, Mugabe's slum clearance programme which began in 2005. Bulawayo's second novel, \"Glory\", a satire based on the 2017 coup against Robert Mugabe, was also shortlisted for the Booker Prize. Zimbabwean author Tsitsi Dangarembga's novels have received widespread critical acclaim and her third, \"This Mournable Body\", was shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 2020.\nNotable Zimbabwean artists include Henry Mudzengerere and Nicolas Mukomberanwa. A recurring theme in Zimbabwean art is the metamorphosis of man into beast. Zimbabwean musicians like Thomas Mapfumo, Oliver Mtukudzi, the Bhundu Boys, Stella Chiweshe, Alick Macheso and Audius Mtawarira have achieved international recognition. Among members of the white minority community, Theatre has a large following, with numerous theatrical companies performing in Zimbabwe's urban areas.\nCuisine.\nLike in many African countries, the majority of Zimbabweans depend on a few staple foods. \"Mealie meal\", also known as cornmeal, is used to prepare \"sadza\" or \"isitshwala\", as well as porridge known as \"bota\" or \"ilambazi\". \"Sadza\" is made by mixing the cornmeal with water to produce a thick paste/porridge. After the paste has been cooking for several minutes, more cornmeal is added to thicken the paste. This is usually eaten as lunch or dinner, usually with sides such as gravy, vegetables (spinach, chomolia, or spring greens/collard greens), beans, and meat (stewed, grilled, roasted, or sundried). \"Sadza\" is also commonly eaten with curdled milk (sour milk), commonly known as \"lacto\" (\"mukaka wakakora\"), or dried Tanganyika sardine, known locally as \"kapenta\" or \"matemba\". \"Bota\" is a thinner porridge, cooked without the additional cornmeal and usually flavoured with peanut butter, milk, butter, or jam. \"Bota\" is usually eaten for breakfast.\nGraduations, weddings, and any other family gatherings will usually be celebrated with the killing of a goat or cow, which will be barbecued or roasted by the family.\nEven though the Afrikaners are a small group (10%) within the white minority group, Afrikaner recipes are popular. \"Biltong\", a type of jerky, is a popular snack, prepared by hanging bits of spiced raw meat to dry in the shade. \"Boerewors\" is served with \"sadza\". It is a long sausage, often well-spiced, composed of beef and any other meat like pork, and barbecued.\nAs Zimbabwe was a British colony, some people there have adopted some colonial-era English eating habits. For example, most people will have porridge in the morning, as well as 10 o'clock tea (midday tea). They will have lunch, often leftovers from the night before, freshly cooked \"sadza\", or sandwiches (which is more common in the cities). After lunch, there is usually 4 o'clock tea (afternoon tea), which is served before dinner. It is not uncommon for tea to be had after dinner.\nRice, pasta, and potato-based foods (French fries and mashed potato) also make up part of Zimbabwean cuisine. A local favourite is rice cooked with peanut butter, which is taken with thick gravy, mixed vegetables and meat. A potpourri of peanuts known as \"nzungu\", boiled and sundried maize, black-eyed peas known as \"nyemba\", and Bambara groundnuts known as \"nyimo\" makes a traditional dish called \"mutakura\".\nSports.\nSoccer is the most popular sport in Zimbabwe. The Warriors have qualified for the Africa Cup of Nations five times (2004, 2006, 2017, 2019, 2021), and won the Southern Africa championship on six occasions (2000, 2003, 2005, 2009, 2017, 2018) and the Eastern Africa cup once (1985). The team is ranked 68th in 2022.\nRugby union is a significant sport in Zimbabwe. The national side have represented the country at 2 Rugby World Cup tournaments in 1987 and 1991.\nCricket is also a very popular sport in Zimbabwe. It used to have a following mostly among the white minority, but it has recently grown to become a widely popular sport among most Zimbabweans.\nMedia.\nThe media of Zimbabwe is now once again diverse, having come under tight restriction between 2002 and 2008 by the government during the economic and political crisis. The Zimbabwean constitution promises freedom of the media and expression. Since the appointment of a new media and information minister in 2013 the media is facing less political interference, and the supreme court has ruled some sections of the strict media laws as unconstitutional. In July 2009 the BBC and CNN were able to resume operations and report legally and openly from Zimbabwe. The Zimbabwe Ministry of Media, Information and Publicity stated that, \"the Zimbabwe government never banned the BBC from carrying out lawful activities inside Zimbabwe\".\nIn 2010 the Zimbabwe Media Commission was established by the inclusive, power-sharing government. In May 2010 the commission licensed three privately owned newspapers, including the previously banned \"Daily News\", for publication. Reporters Without Borders described the decisions as a \"major advance\". In June 2010 \"NewsDay\" became the first independent daily newspaper to be published in Zimbabwe in seven years. The Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation's monopoly in the broadcasting sector was ended with the licensing of two private radio stations in 2012. The main published newspapers are \"The Herald\" and \"The Chronicle\" which are printed in Harare and Bulawayo respectively.\nSince the 2002 Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act was passed, a number of privately owned news outlets were shut down by the government, including \"Daily News\" whose managing director Wilf Mbanga went on to form the influential \"The Zimbabwean\". As a result, many press organisations have been set up in both neighbouring and Western countries by exiled Zimbabweans. Because the internet is unrestricted, many Zimbabweans are allowed to access online news sites set up by exiled journalists. Reporters Without Borders claims the media environment in Zimbabwe involves \"surveillance, threats, imprisonment, censorship, blackmail, abuse of power and denial of justice are all brought to bear to keep firm control over the news.\" In its 2021 report, Reporters Without Borders ranked the Zimbabwean media as 130th out of 180, noting that \"access to information has improved and self-censorship has declined, but journalists are still often attacked or arrested\". The government also bans many foreign broadcasting stations from Zimbabwe, including the CBC, Sky News, Channel 4, American Broadcasting Company, Australian Broadcasting Corporation, and Fox News. News agencies and newspapers from other Western countries and South Africa have also been banned from the country.\nNational symbols.\nThe stone-carved Zimbabwe Bird appears on the national flags and the coats of arms of both Zimbabwe and Rhodesia, as well as on banknotes and coins (first on Rhodesian pound and then Rhodesian dollar). It probably represents the bateleur eagle or the African fish eagle. The famous soapstone bird carvings stood on walls and monoliths of the ancient city of Great Zimbabwe.\nBalancing rocks are geological formations all over Zimbabwe. The rocks are perfectly balanced without other supports. They are created when ancient granite intrusions are exposed to weathering, as softer rocks surrounding them erode away. They have been depicted on both the banknotes of Zimbabwe and the Rhodesian dollar banknotes. The ones found on the current notes of Zimbabwe, named the Banknote Rocks, are located in Epworth, approximately southeast of Harare. There are many different formations of the rocks, incorporating single and paired columns of three or more rocks. These formations are a feature of south and east tropical Africa from northern South Africa northwards to Sudan. The most notable formations in Zimbabwe are located in the Matobo National Park in Matabeleland.\nThe national anthem of Zimbabwe is \"Raise the Flag of Zimbabwe\" (; ). It was introduced in March 1994 after a nationwide competition to replace as a distinctly Zimbabwean song. The winning entry was a song written by Professor Solomon Mutswairo and composed by Fred Changundega. It has been translated into all three of the main languages of Zimbabwe.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "34401", "revid": "50956642", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34401", "title": "Geography of Zimbabwe", "text": " \nZimbabwe is a landlocked country in southern Africa lying north of the Tropic of Capricorn. During summer, the whole country experiences warm temperatures as a result of the sun being directly overhead. It straddles an extensive high inland plateau that drops northwards to the Zambezi valley where the border with Zambia is and similarly drops southwards to the Limpopo valley and the border with South Africa. \n* Total: 390,757 km\u00b2\n**\"country rank in the world:\" 60th\n* Land: 386,850 km\u00b2\n* Water: 3,910 km\u00b2\n* Australia comparative: slightly less than half the size of New South Wales\n* Canada comparative: slightly smaller than Newfoundland and Labrador\n* United Kingdom comparative: approximately larger than the United Kingdom\n* United States comparative: slightly larger than Montana\n* EU comparative: approximately larger than Germany\nArea and boundaries.\nThe country has borders with Botswana (813\u00a0km), Mozambique 1,231\u00a0km, South Africa (225\u00a0km), Zambia 797\u00a0km and almost meets Namibia at its westernmost point.\nClimate.\nThe climate varies markedly with altitude with the Eastern Highlands at above sea level being much wetter and cooler than lower altitudes. There is a dry season, including a short cool season during the period May to September, when the whole country has very little rain. The rainy season is typically a time of heavy rainfall from November to March. The whole country is influenced by the Intertropical Convergence Zone during January. In years when it is poorly defined there is below-average rainfall and a likelihood of serious drought in the country, as happened in 1983 and 1992. When it is well defined rainfall is average or well above average, as in 1981 and 1986. Zimbabwe\u2019s climate can be categorised into three regions, hot region (lowveld and part of the middleveld), warm region (rest of the middleveld and high veld) and the cool region (Eastern Highlands)\nTerrain.\nMuch of the country is on a plateau with a higher central plateau (high veld) forming a watershed between the Zambezi and Limpopo river systems. The flattish watershed region is part of an ancient etchplain called the African Surface covers large swathes of the continent. While the African Surface occupy the higher ground, spurs and small interfluves a younger \"post-African\" surface occupy lower positions with occasional rock domes, koppies and tors protruding rolling or plain landscape. The Limpopo and the lower Zambezi valleys are broad and relatively flat plains. The eastern end of the watershed terminates in a north-south mountain spine, called the Eastern Highlands. The northeast-southwest oriented central uplands have been uplifted in geologically recent times (Late Pliocene or Pleistocene) deviating the watercourse of upper Zambezi River that used to flow into the Limpopo River to the east to its current outlet at the Mozambique Channel. The northeast-southwest upland and watershed follows the axis of an epeirogenic flexure. \nElevation extremes:\n&lt;br&gt;\"lowest point:\" junction of the Runde and Save rivers 162 m \n&lt;br&gt;\"highest point:\" Mount Nyangani 2,592 m\nNatural resources: coal, chromium ore, asbestos, gold, nickel, copper, iron ore, vanadium, lithium, tin, diamond, platinum group metals\nLand use:\n&lt;br&gt;\"arable land:\" 10.49%\n&lt;br&gt;\"permanent crops:\" 0.31%\n&lt;br&gt;\"other:\" 89.20% (2011)\nIrrigated land: 1,735\u00a0km\u00b2 (2003)\nTotal renewable water resources: 20\u00a0km3 (2011)\nNatural hazards: droughts; floods and severe storms are rare\nEnvironment \u2014 current issues: deforestation; soil erosion; land degradation; air and water pollution; the black rhinoceros herd \u2013 once the largest concentration of the species in the world \u2013 has been significantly reduced by poaching; poor mining practices have led to toxic waste and heavy metal pollution\nEnvironment \u2014 international agreements: \u21b5party to: Biodiversity, Climate Change, Desertification, Endangered Species, Law of the Sea, Ozone Layer Protection\nsigned, but not ratified: none of the selected agreements.\nHydrology: \u21b5The country is divided into six drainage basins. The largest are the Zambezi and the Limpopo. Western parts of Matabeleland connect to the Okavango inland drainage basin through the Nata River. Most of southern Mashonaland and adjacent parts of Masvingo drain through the Save river into the Indian Ocean. Two smaller drainage basins cover parts of Manicaland, and drain into the Indian Ocean through Mozambique. These are the Pungwe river to the north and the Buzi river to the south. Sediment transport has been studied for rivers in Zimbabwe using the HBV hydrology transport model.\nMain land use type:\nExtreme points.\nThis is a list of the extreme points of Zimbabwe, the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location.\nWeather hazards in Zimbabwe.\nWeather hazards are conditions which are unfavorable to people and their activities that result from weather phenomena, and include any naturally occurring weather condition that has the potential to cause harm to people. Most of these cannot be prevented however their effects can be mitigated. Zimbabwe is affected by various weather hazards including droughts, floods, heat wave, lightning and wildfires over the past century. These weather hazards has affected a lot of people in Zimbabwe resulting to a number of deaths and other challenges. Sixteen districts across six provinces Manicaland, Mashonaland Central, Mashonaland West, Mashonaland East, Midlands and Matabeleland North in Zimbabwe have been affected by heavy rains and floods since the 2021/2022 rainy season began in October 2021. Tropical Storm Ana brought heavy rains to Zimbabwe in late-January, causing floods and damage, affecting 845 houses and 51 schools.\nTypes of weather hazards that have affected Zimbabwe..\nThe main weather hazards that have affected Zimbabwe include:\nDrought.\nDrought has to do with a period of abnormally dry weather which is caused little or no rainfall producing a lack of water.\nEffects of Drought in Zimbabwe.\nIn Zimbabwe droughts carry many effects which include factors leading to economic struggles. Inflation rates go up as farmers undergo crop failure and loss of livestock a well as often wildfires. Due to drought the country is faced with serious water shortages as well as outrageous power cuts.\nMitigation.\nTo limit the effects of drought the country can make use of cloud seeding, stocking of harvest in GMBs during fruitful years and/or practice irrigation.\nBuilding and servicing dams and rivers that are no longer serving their purpose\nFloods.\nFlooding refer to an abnormal overflow of a large amount of water beyond its normal limits, especially over what is normally Drylands. These are caused by abnormal rainfall and cyclones.\nEffects of Floods in Zimbabwe.\nThe primary effects of flooding include loss of life and damage to buildings and other structures, including bridges, sewerage systems, roadways, and canals. Floods also frequently damage power transmission and sometimes power generation. As a common after-effect of severe flooding, Zimbabwe has also faced economic hardship due to a temporary decline in tourism, rebuilding costs, or food shortages leading to price increases.\nMitigation.\nIn January 2022 the country's Department of Civil Protection (DCP) set up 394 evacuation centers in Manicaland province to deal with the impact of Cyclone Ana. This was the government's way of limiting the effects of the floods as it was noted that parts of Mutasa and Chimanimani districts were already receiving strong winds and heavy rains associated with the storm. Another way of mitigating the effects of flooding is relocating people before during and after the floods and ensuring that everyone is at safe place when the cyclone hits the area. This is seen in Zimbabwe where the authorities announced that school children from the most vulnerable areas should not go to school but stay home on the days when cyclone Freddy was expected.\nLightning.\nLightning is associated with weather patterns whereby there is a natural electrical discharge from the clouds which occurs for a very short period and it heats the ground or earth, it is usually accompanied by a bright flash and typical thunder. Lightning may damage a lot of things and may is dangerous to livelihood.\nEffects of lightning in Zimbabwe.\nLightning is very harmful; it affects both livelihood as well as the infrastructure. A number of people have been hospitalized and some died due to the effects of lightning this is evidenced when lightning bolt struck and wounded 13 male prisoners while they were having lunch at a jail in northwestern Zimbabwe, and in some areas especially game parks a number of animals have died due to lightning. Lightning also has a record of destroying infrastructure, one family in Beitbridge were left stranded as they lost their home to lightning.\nMitigation.\nTo prevent and reduce the effects of lightning people are advised to avoid open spaces as well as standing under tall trees and to ensure that buildings have lightning protection.\nFrost.\nFrost occurs when weather patterns changes causing a deposit of small white ice crystals formed on the ground, windows, cars or other open surfaces when the temperature falls below freezing\nEffects of Frost in Zimbabwe.\nIn 2021 Zimbabwe Farmers Union director Paul Zakariya confirmed to herald that a number of farmers are affected by frost as he said they had received numerous reports of ground frost that had affected several crops across the Zimbabwean growers hit by frosty conditions. In some areas like Matobo wear frost often hits people are always affected by frostbites as they would have been affected by the cold.\nMitigation.\nAgriculture expert Mr Ivan Craig encouraged farmers to reduce damage of crop to frost by growing crops that are less susceptible to frost in winter these are onion, peas, garlic, cauliflower, broccoli, carrot and winter cabbage among others. People who are in areas always affected by frost are encouraged to keep warm all the time to avoid developing frostbites. Farmers could also construct a wall of thatch grass around the garden or burn cow dung around the field as this will help trap frost when it comes.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This is in accordance with the model of a developing country with high birth rates and falling death rates, resulting in relatively high population growth rate (around 3% or above in the 1960s and early 1970s). After a spurt in the period 1980\u20131983 following independence, a decline in birth rates set in. Since 1991, however, there has been a jump in death rates from a low of 10 per 1000 in 1985 to a high of 25 per 1000 in 2002/2003. It has since subsided to just under 22 per 1000 (estimate for 2007) a little below the birth rate of around 27 per 1000.\nZimStat released the 2022 Population and Housing Census Preliminary Results which showed that Zimbabwe's population had increased by 16.2% and stood at 15.1 million people as of 20 April 2022.\n&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chart/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;\n&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chart/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;\n&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chart/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;\n&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chart/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;\nCensus data.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCurrent estimates.\nBased on , the population of Zimbabwe was estimated by the United Nations at in . About 38.9% comprised youths under 15, while another 56.9% grouped persons aged between 15 and 65 years. Only around 4.2% of citizens were apparently over 65.\nPopulation Estimates by Sex and Age Group (01.VII.2020):\nVital statistics.\nUnited Nations estimates.\nRegistration of vital events in Zimbabwe is not complete. The Population Department of the United Nations prepared the following estimates.\nDemographic and Health Surveys.\nTotal Fertility Rate (TFR) (Wanted Fertility Rate) and Crude Birth Rate (CBR):\nFertility data as of 2010\u20132011 (DHS Program):\nLife expectancy at birth.\nLife expectancy from 1950 to 2021 (\"UN World Population Prospects\"):\nEthnic groups.\nAccording to 2012 Census report, 99.6% of the population is of African origin.\nOf the rest of the population, the great bulk\u2014perhaps 30,000 persons\u2014are White Zimbabweans of European ancestry, a minority which had diminished in size prior to independence.\nThe vast black majority has grown at a projected annual rate of 4.3% since 1980. Although present figures are difficult to ascertain, the white community once reproduced itself at an annual rate (under 1.5%) similar to that of most totals in developed nations. Of the two major ethnolinguistic categories, Shona speakers formed a decisive plurality at (80&lt;)% and occupied the eastern two-thirds of Zimbabwe. Ndebele speakers constitute about 16%, and none of the other indigenous ethnic groups came to as much as 2% in recent decades. African speakers of nonindigenous languages included migrant workers from Malawi, Zambia, and Mozambique.\nOver 90% of White Zimbabweans are of British or British diasporan origin; at various times, many emigrated from South Africa and elsewhere. After World War II, Zimbabwe (then Southern Rhodesia) received a substantial influx of emigrants from the United Kingdom\u2014a handful previously resided in other colonies such as India, Pakistan and Kenya. Also represented on a much smaller scale were individuals of Afrikaner, Greek, and Portuguese origin. After Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965, Ian Smith's administration removed technical obstacles to immigration from southern Europe.\nA heavily urbanised Coloured population is descended, partially, from early unions between White Rhodesian settlers and local Black African females. Many, however, can also trace their ancestry to the Dutch/Khoisan mulatto clans of the Cape.\nWith the exception of a select few who were brought to Zimbabwe as railroad workers, most Asians in Zimbabwe arrived from India pursuing employment or entrepreneurship. An educated class, they have traditionally engaged in retail trade or manufacturing.\nLanguages.\nZimbabwe has 16 official languages: Chewa, Chibarwe, English, Kalanga, Koisan, Nambya, Ndau, Ndebele, Shangani, Shona, sign language, Sotho, Tonga, Tswana, Venda, and Xhosa. English is widely used in administration, law and schools, though less than 2.5%, mainly the white and Coloured (mixed race) minorities, consider it their native language. The rest of the population speak Shona (70%) and Ndebele (20%), Kalanga (2%), etc. Shona has a rich oral tradition, which was incorporated into the first Shona novel, \"Feso\" by Solomon Mutswairo, published in 1956. English is spoken primarily in the cities, but less so in rural areas. Television news is broadcast in English, Shona and Ndebele though the local languages time slot falls out of prime viewing time, but radio broadcasts in English, Ndebele, Shona, Kalanga, Nambya, Venda, Suthu and Tonga. English, Ndebele and Shona are given far more airtime.\nReligion.\nChristians comprise 85% of the Zimbabwean population. Of that number, 61% regularly attend Christian churches. The largest Christian churches are Anglican, Roman Catholic, Seventh Day Adventist and Methodist. However, like most former European colonies, Christianity is often mixed with enduring traditional beliefs. Besides Christianity, ancestral worship (Amadlozi) is the most practised non-Christian religion which involves ancestor worship and spiritual intercession. Under 1% of the population is Muslim, although many Zimbabweans are influenced by Abrahamic food laws.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The ZANU\u2013PF party has historically been dominant in Zimbabwe politics. The party, which was led by Robert Mugabe from 1980 to 2017, has used the powers of the state to intimidate, imprison and otherwise hobble political opposition in Zimbabwe, as well as use state funds and state media to advance the interests of the party.\nPer the 2013 Constitution, Zimbabwe is a full presidential republic, whereby the President is the head of state and government. Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and parliament. The status of Zimbabwean politics has been thrown into question by a 2017 coup.\nZimbabwe has been undergoing an economic crisis since the late 1990s.\nPolitical developments since the Lancaster House Agreement.\nThe Zimbabwean Constitution, initially from the Lancaster House Agreement a few months before the 1980 elections, chaired by Lord Carrington, institutionalises majority rule and protection of minority rights. Since independence, the Constitution has been amended by the government to provide for:\nThe elected government controls senior appointments in the public service, including the military and police, and ensures that appointments at lower levels are made on an equitable basis by the independent Public Service Commission.\nZANU-PF leader Robert Mugabe, elected prime minister in 1980, revised the constitution in 1987 to make himself president. President Mugabe's affiliated party won every election from independence on April 18, 1980, until it lost the parliamentary elections in March 2008 to the Movement for Democratic Change. In some quarters corruption and rigging elections have been alleged. In particular the elections of 1990 were nationally and internationally condemned as being rigged, with the second-placed party, Edgar Tekere's Zimbabwe Unity Movement, winning only 20% of the vote. Presidential elections were held in 2002 amid allegations of vote-rigging, intimidation, and fraud, and again in March 2008.\nEthnic rivalry between the Shona and Ndebele has played a large part in Zimbabwe's politics, a consequence of the country's borders defined by its British colonial rulers. This continued after independence in 1980, during the Gukurahundi ethnic cleansing liberation wars in Matabeleland in the 1980s. This led to the political merger of Joshua Nkomo's Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) with the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) to form ZANU-PF and the appointment of Nkomo as vice president.\nDuring 2005, with Mugabe's future in question, factionalism within the Shona has increased. In October 2005 it was alleged that members of the ruling ZANU-PF and the opposition MDC had held secret meetings in London and Washington to discuss plans for a new Zimbabwe after Robert Mugabe. On February 6, 2007, Mugabe orchestrated a Cabinet reshuffle, ousting ministers including 5-year veteran Minister of Finance Herbert Murerwa.\nPolitical conditions.\nSince the defeat of the constitutional referendum in 2000, politics in Zimbabwe has been marked by a move from the norms of democratic governance, such as democratic elections, the independence of the judiciary, the rule of law, freedom from racial discrimination, the existence of independent media, civil society and academia. Recent years have seen widespread violations of human rights.\nElections have been marked by political violence and intimidation, along with the politicisation of the judiciary, military, police force and public services. Statements by the President and government politicians have referred to a state of war, or \"Chimurenga\", against the opposition political parties, in particular the Movement for Democratic Change \u2013 Tsvangirai (MDC-T). Newspapers not aligned with the government have been closed down and members of the judiciary have been threatened and/or arrested. Repressive laws aimed at preventing freedoms of speech, assembly and association have been implemented and subjectively enforced. Members of the opposition are routinely arrested and harassed, with some subjected to torture or sentenced to jail. The legal system has come under increasing threat. The MDC has repeatedly attempted to use the legal system to challenge the ruling ZANU-PF, but the rulings, often in favour of the MDC, have not been taken into account by the police.\nGovernment of Zimbabwe.\nPolitical power in Zimbabwe is split between three branches, the executive, the legislative and the judicial branches, with the President as the head of the executive branch, the Prime Minister the head of the legislative branch and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Zimbabwe the head of the judicial branch.\nExecutive.\nUnder the present Zimbabwean Constitution, the President's powers can be grouped roughly into the following categories:\nUnder Zimbabwe's Constitution, the president is the head of state, government and commander-in-chief of the defense forces, elected by popular majority vote. Prior to 2013, the president was elected for a 6-year term with no term limits. The new constitution approved in the 2013 constitutional referendum limits the president to two 5-year terms, but this does not take effect retrospectively (Robert Mugabe had held the office from 1987 to 2017).\nThe Cabinet is appointed by the president and responsible to the House of Assembly.\nThe Minister of State for Presidential Affairs is a non-cabinet ministerial position in the government of Zimbabwe. The incumbent is Didymus Mutasa. The duties of the position have yet to be publicly defined.\nLegislature.\nParliament consists of the House of Assembly and, since 2005, the Senate, which had previously been abolished in 1990. The House of Assembly has 210 members elected by universal suffrage, including the Speaker, and the Attorney General, and may serve for a maximum of five years. Under the 2013 constitution, the Senate consists of 80 members, of whom 60 are elected for five-year terms in 6-member constituencies representing one of the 10 provinces, elected based on the votes in the lower house election, using party-list proportional representation, distributed using the hare quota. Additionally the Senate consists of 2 seats for each non-metropolitan district of Zimbabwe elected by each provincial assembly of chiefs using SNTV, 1 seat each for the president and deputy president of the National Council of Chiefs and 1 male and 1 female seat for people with disabilities elected on separate ballots using FPTP by an electoral college designated by the National Disability Board.\nJudiciary.\nThe judiciary is headed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Zimbabwe who, like their contemporaries, is appointed by the President on the advice of the Judicial Service Commission. The Constitution has a Bill of Rights containing extensive protection of human rights. The Bill of Rights could not be amended for the first 10 years of independence except by unanimous vote of Parliament.\nThe Supreme Court is the highest court of order and the final court of appeal. The Chief Justice is the senior judge. Others who sit on the bench of the Supreme Court of Zimbabwe are Justice Paddington Garwe, former Judge-President of the High Court, Wilson Sandura and Vernanda Ziyambi. Luke Malaba, a former justice of the Supreme Court, was appointed acting chief justice on 1 March 2017 following the retirement of Chief Justice Godfrey Chidyausiku. Malaba was promoted to chief justice on 28 March.\nThe legal system is based on Roman-Dutch law with South African influences. A five-member Supreme Court, headed by the Chief-Justice has original jurisdiction over alleged violations of fundamental rights guaranteed in the constitution and appellate jurisdiction over other matters. There is a High Court consisting of general and appellate divisions. Below the High Court are regional magistrate's courts with civil jurisdiction and magistrate's courts with both civil and criminal jurisdiction over cases involving traditional law and custom. Beginning in 1981, these courts were integrated into the national system.\nList of chief justices of Zimbabwe:\nProvincial governance.\n\"Main articles: Provinces of Zimbabwe, Districts of Zimbabwe\"\nInternational organization participation.\nZimbabwe participates in the following Pan-African and international organisations:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "34404", "revid": "48290420", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34404", "title": "Economy of Zimbabwe", "text": "The economy of Zimbabwe is a gold standard based economy. Zimbabwe has a $44 billion dollar informal economy in PPP terms which translates to 64.1% of the total economy. Agriculture and mining largely contribute to exports. The economy is estimated to be at $73 billion at the end of 2023.\nThe country has reserves of metallurgical-grade chromite. Other commercial mineral deposits include coal, diamonds, lithium, asbestos, copper, nickel, gold, platinum and iron ore.\nSince the end of the civil war in 1980, Zimbabwe has had a tumultuous economy, going from Africa's breadbasket to a country where, as of March 2025, over one-third of its population is facing food insecurity.\nThe sweeping impact of land reform.\nIn 2000, Zimbabwe launched a controversial land reform that, over the next decade, would seize about 6,000 large, white-owned farms and convert them into over 168,000 black-owned farms. Many of the new occupants, mainly consisting of landless black citizens and several prominent members of the ruling ZANU-PF administration, were inexperienced or uninterested in farming, thereby failing to retain the labour-intensive, highly efficient management of previous landowners, triggering severe export losses.\nThis policy of widespread seizure of private land and property spooked international investors and negatively affected market confidence. The US and other nations slapped sanctions on government officials due to the human rights abuses attributable to the land reform. Many sanctions continue to this day.\nIn this time, between 1999\u20132008, Zimbabwe's GDP shrunk by nearly half \u2014 the most severe downturn in a country not at war in recorded history.\nHyperinflation and currency changes.\nBetween 2003\u20132006, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe began printing money at an extreme rate, causing inflation to spike by a factor of 1,000. By the middle of 2008, Zimbabwe hit a breaking point. Inflation hit 89.7 sextillion percent \u2014 a $100 trillion bill didn't even cover a bus fare.\nShortly afterwards, the government introduced a multi-currency system, making U.S. dollars, and other currencies legal tender. The Zimbabwe dollar, now nearly worthless, disappeared from circulation.\nAfter a period of relative economic stability, the government reintroduced local currency again in 2019, and quickly faced challenges in maintaining its value. At the time of its reintroduction, one loaf of bread cost between 2 and 3 Zimbabwean dollars. By 2024, the price had risen to 24,000 Zimbabwean dollars, roughly equivalent to 1 United States dollar. Although the U.S. dollar remains officially tolerated, many vendors are reluctant to accept payments in local currency due to its instability.\nIn April 2024, the government launched a new currency, Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG), to replace the Zimbabwean dollar. Backed by the country's reserves of foreign currency and precious metals, primarily gold, the new currency aimed to curb inflation by preventing excessive money printing and to restore price stability.\nCurrent economic conditions.\nGovernment spending is 29.7% of GDP. State enterprises are strongly subsidized. Taxes and tariffs are high, and state regulation is costly to companies. Starting or closing a business is slow and costly. Due to the regulations of the labour market, hiring and terminating workers is a lengthy process. By 2008, an unofficial estimate of unemployment had risen to 94%.\nAs of 2023, Zimbabwe's official unemployment rate stood at 9.3%, though the vast majority of workers are in the informal sector, made up of low-paying, temporary and precarious jobs.\nA 2014 report by the Africa Progress Panel found that, of all the African countries examined when determining how many years it would take to double per capita GDP, Zimbabwe fared the worst, and that at its current rate of development it would take 190 years for the country to double its per capita GDP. Uncertainty around the indigenisation programme (compulsory acquisition), the perceived lack of a free press, the possibility of abandoning the US dollar as official currency, and political uncertainty following the end of the government of national unity with the MDC as well as power struggles within ZANU-PF have increased concerns that the country's economic situation could further deteriorate.\nIn September 2016 the finance minister identified \"low levels of production and the attendant trade gap, insignificant foreign direct investment and lack of access to international finance due to huge arrears\" as significant causes for the poor performance of the economy.\nZimbabwe came 140 out of 190 ease of doing business report released by the World Bank Group. They were ranked high for ability to get credit\u00a0(ranked 85) and\u00a0protecting minority investors\u00a0(ranked 95).\nInfrastructure and resources.\nTransportation.\nZimbabwe's internal transportation and electrical power networks are adequate; nevertheless, maintenance has been ignored for several years. Zimbabwe is crossed by two trans-African automobile routes: the Cairo-Cape Town Highway and the Beira-Lobito Highway. Poorly paved highways connect the major urban and industrial areas, while rail lines controlled by the National Railways of Zimbabwe connect Zimbabwe to a vast central African railroad network that connects it to all of its neighbors.\nEnergy.\nThe Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority is responsible for providing the country with electrical energy. Zimbabwe has two larger facilities for the generation of electrical power, the Kariba Dam (owned together with Zambia) and since 1983 by large Hwange Thermal Power Station adjacent to the Hwange coal field. However, total generation capacity does not meet the demand, leading to rolling blackouts. The Hwange station is not capable of using its full capacity due to old age and maintenance neglect. In 2006, crumbling infrastructure and lack of spare parts for generators and coal mining lead to Zimbabwe importing 40% of its power, including 100\u00a0megawatts from the Democratic Republic of Congo, 200\u00a0megawatts from Mozambique, up to 450 from South Africa, and 300\u00a0megawatts from Zambia. In May 2010 the country's generation power was an estimated 940MW against a peak demand of 2500MW. Use of local small scale generators is widespread.\nTelephone.\nNew telephone lines used to be difficult to obtain. With TelOne, however, Zimbabwe has only one fixed line service provider. Cellular phone networks are an alternative. Principal mobile phone operators are Telecel, Net*One, and Econet.\nAgriculture.\nAgriculture in Zimbabwe can be divided into two parts: commercial farming of crops such as cotton, tobacco, coffee, peanuts and various fruits, and subsistence farming with staple crops, such as maize or wheat.\nCommercial farming was almost exclusively in the hands of the white minority until the controversial land redistribution program began in 2000. Land in Zimbabwe was forcibly seized from white farmers and redistributed to black settlers, justified by Mugabe on the grounds that it was meant to rectify inequalities left over from colonialism. The new owners did not have land titles, and as such did not have the collateral necessary to access bank loans. The small-scale farmers also did not have experience with commercial-scale agriculture.\nAfter land redistribution, much of Zimbabwe's land went fallow, and agricultural production decreased steeply. The University of Zimbabwe estimated in 2008 that between 2000 and 2007 agricultural production decreased by 51%. Production of tobacco, Zimbabwe's main export crop, decreased by 79% from 2000 to 2008.\nTobacco production recovered after 2008 thanks to the contract system of agriculture and growing Chinese demand. International tobacco companies, such as British American Tobacco and China Tobacco, supplied farmers with agricultural inputs, equipment, and loans, and supervised them in growing tobacco. By 2018, tobacco production had recovered to 258 million kg, the second largest crop on record. Instead of large white-owned farms selling mostly to European and American companies, Zimbabwe's tobacco sector now consists of small black-owned farms exporting over half of the crop to China. Tobacco farming accounted for 11% of Zimbabwe's GDP in 2017, and 3 million of its 16 million people depended on tobacco for their livelihood.\nLand reform has found considerable support in Africa and a few supporters among African-American activists, but Jesse Jackson commented during a visit to South Africa in June 2006, \"Land redistribution has long been a noble goal to achieve but it has to be done in a way that minimises trauma. The process has to attract investors rather than scare them away. What is required in Zimbabwe is democratic rule, democracy is lacking in the country and that is the major cause of this economic meltdown.\"\nZimbabwe produced, in 2018:\nIn addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products.\nMining sector.\nAs other southern African countries, Zimbabwean soil is rich in raw materials, namely platinum, coal, iron ore, and gold. Recently, diamonds have also been found in considerable deposits. Copper, chromite and nickel deposits also exist, though in lesser amounts. The Marange diamond fields, discovered in 2006 are thought to be among the richest in the world.\nIn March 2011, the government of Zimbabwe implemented laws which required local ownership of mining companies; following this news, there were falls in the share prices of companies with mines in Zimbabwe.\nVarious NGOs reported that the diamond sector in Zimbabwe is rife with corruption; a November 2012 report by NGO Reap What You Sow revealed a huge lack of transparency of diamond revenues and asserted that Zimbabwe's elite are benefiting from the country's diamonds. This followed former South African President Thabo Mbeki\u2019s warning days earlier that Zimbabwe needed to stop its \"predatory elite\" from colluding with mining companies for their own benefit.\nAlso in that month, the Associated Press reported that at least $2 billion worth of diamonds had been stolen from Zimbabwe's eastern diamond fields and had enriched Mugabe's ruling circle and various connected gem dealers and criminals.\nIn January 2013, Zimbabwe's mineral exports totalled $1.8 billion.\nAs of October 2014, Metallon Corporation was Zimbabwe's largest gold miner. The group is controlled by its Chairman Mzi Khumalo.\nIn 2019, the country was the world's 3rd largest producer of platinum and the 6th largest world producer of lithium. In the production of gold, in 2017 the country produced 23.9 tons.\nEducation.\nThe state of education in Zimbabwe affects the development of the economy while the state of the economy can affect access and quality of teachers and education. Zimbabwe has one of Africa's highest literacy rates at over 90%. The crisis since 2000 has, however, diminished these achievements because of a lack of resources and the exodus of teachers and specialists (e.g. doctors, scientists, engineers) to other countries. Also, the start of the new curriculum in primary and secondary sections has affected the state of the once strong education sector.\nMacroeconomic data.\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1990\u20132023. Inflation under 10% is in green.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Static row numbers/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\nScience and technology.\nZimbabwe's \"Second Science and Technology Policy\" (2012) cites sectorial policies with a focus on biotechnology, information and communication technologies (ICTs), space sciences, nanotechnology, indigenous knowledge systems, technologies yet to emerge and scientific solutions to emergent environmental challenges. The policy makes provisions for establishing a National Nanotechnology Programme.\nZimbabwe has a \"National Biotechnology Policy\" which dates from 2005. Despite poor infrastructure and a lack of both human and financial resources, biotechnology research is better established in Zimbabwe than in most sub-Saharan countries, even if it tends to use primarily traditional techniques.\nThe \"Second Science and Technology Policy\" asserts the government commitment to allocating at least 1% of GDP to research and development, focusing at least 60% of university education on developing skills in science and technology and ensuring that school pupils devote at least 30% of their time to studying science subjects.\nHistory.\nIn 1997, Zimbabwe's economic decline began to visibly take place. It began with the crash of the stock market on November 14, 1997. Civil society groups began to agitate for their rights as these had been eroded under ESAP. In 1997 alone, 232 strikes were recorded, the largest number in any year since independence (Kanyenze 2004). During the first half of 1997, the war veterans organized themselves and demonstrations that were initially ignored by the government. As the intensity of the strikes grew, the government was forced to pay the war veterans a once-off gratuity of ZWD $50,000 by December 31, 1997, and a monthly pension of US$2,000 beginning January 1998 (Kanyenze 2004). To raise money for this unbudgeted expense, the government tried to introduce a \u2018war veterans\u2019 levy,\u2019 but they faced much opposition from the labor force and had to effectively borrow money to meet these obligations. Following the massive depreciation of the Zimbabwean dollar in 1997, the cost of agricultural inputs soared, undermining the viability of the producers who in turn demanded that the producer price of maize (corn) be raised. Millers then hiked prices by 24 percent in January 1998 by 24 percent and the consequent increase in the price of maize meal triggered nation-wide riots during the last month. The government intervened by introducing price controls on all basic commodities (Kanyenze 2004). Multiple interventionist moves were undertaken to try to reverse some of the negative effects of the Structural Adjustment Programs and to try to strengthen the private sector that was suffering from decreasing output and increasing competition from cheap imported products. Some of the most detrimental policies that followed include:\n1980\u20132000.\nAt the time of independence, annual inflation was 5.4 percent and month-to-month inflation was 0.5 percent. Currency of Z$2, Z$5, Z$10 and Z$20 denominations were released. Roughly 95 percent of transactions used the Zimbabwean dollar.\nFollowing the Lancaster House Agreement in December 1979, the transition to majority rule in early 1980, and the lifting of sanctions, Zimbabwe enjoyed a brisk economic recovery. Real growth for 1980\u20131981 exceeded 20%. However, depressed foreign demand for the country's mineral exports and the onset of a drought cut sharply into the growth rate in 1982, 1983, and 1984. In 1985, the economy rebounded strongly due to a 30% jump in agricultural production. However, it slumped in 1986 to a zero growth rate and registered a negative of about 3% in 1987, primarily because of drought and the foreign exchange crisis faced by the country. Zimbabwe's GDP grew on average by about 4.5% between 1980 and 1990.\nIn 1992, a World Bank study indicated that more than 500 health centres had been built since 1980. The percentage of children vaccinated increased from 25% in 1980 to 67% in 1988, and life expectancy increased from 55 to 59 years. Enrolment increased by 232 percent one year after primary education was made free, and secondary school enrolment increased by 33 percent in two years. These social policies lead to an increase in the debt ratio. Several laws were passed in the 1980s in an attempt to reduce wage gaps. However, the gaps remained considerable. In 1988, the law gave women, at least in theory, the same rights as men. Previously, they could only take a few personal initiatives without the consent of their father or husband.\nThe government started crumbling when a bonus to independence war veterans was announced in 1997 (which was equal to 3 percent of GDP) followed by unexpected spending due to Zimbabwe's involvement in the Second Congo War in 1998. In 1999, the country also witnessed a drought which further weakened the economy, ultimately leading to the country's bankruptcy in the next decade. In the same year, 1999, Zimbabwe experienced its first defaults on its IMF, World Bank, and African Development Bank debts in addition to debts taken out with Western lenders.\n2000\u20132009.\nIn recent years, there has been economic hardship in Zimbabwe. Multiple western countries argue that the Government of Zimbabwe's land reform program, recurrent interference with, and intimidation of the judiciary, as well as maintenance of unrealistic price controls and exchange rates has led to a sharp drop in investor confidence.\nBetween 2000 and December 2007, the national economy contracted by as much as 40%; inflation vaulted to over 66,000%, and there were persistent shortages of hard currency, fuel, medicine, and food. GDP per capita dropped by 40%, agricultural output dropped by 51% and industrial production dropped by 47%.\nThe Mugabe Government attribute Zimbabwe's economic difficulties to sanctions imposed by the Western powers. It has been argued that the sanctions imposed by Britain, the US, and the EU have been designed to cripple the economy and the conditions of the Zimbabwean people in an attempt to overthrow President Mugabe's government. These countries on their side argue that the sanctions are targeted against Mugabe and his inner circle and some of the companies they own. Critics point to the so-called \"Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act of 2001\", signed by Bush, as an effort to undermine Zimbabwe's economy. Soon after the bill was signed, IMF cut off its resources to Zimbabwe. Financial institutions began withdrawing support for Zimbabwe. Terms of the sanctions made it such that all economic assistance would be structured in support of \"democratisation, respect for human rights and the rule of law.\" The EU terminated its support for all projects in Zimbabwe. Because of the sanctions and US and EU foreign policy, none of Zimbabwe's debts have been cancelled as in other countries.\nOther observers also point out how the asset freezes by the EU on people or companies associated with Zimbabwe's Government have had significant economic and social costs to Zimbabwe.\nAs of February 2004, Zimbabwe's foreign debt repayments ceased, resulting in compulsory suspension from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This, and the United Nations World Food Programme stopping its food aid due to insufficient donations from the world community, has forced the government into borrowing from local sources.\nHyperinflation (2004\u20132009).\nZimbabwe began experiencing severe foreign exchange shortages, exacerbated by the difference between the official rate and the black market rate in 2000. In 2004 a system of auctioning scarce foreign currency for importers was introduced, which temporarily led to a slight reduction in the foreign currency crisis, but by mid-2005 foreign currency shortages were once again severe. The currency was devalued by the central bank twice, first to 9,000 to the US$, and then to 17,500 to the US$ on 20 July 2005, but at that date it was reported that that was only half the rate available on the black market.\nIn July 2005 Zimbabwe was reported to be appealing to the South African government for US$1\u00a0billion of emergency loans, but despite regular rumours that the idea was being discussed no substantial financial support has been publicly reported.\nIn December 2005 Zimbabwe made a mystery loan repayment of US$120 million to the International Monetary Fund due to expulsion threat from IMF.\nThe official Zimbabwean dollar exchange rate had been frozen at Z$101,196 per U.S. dollar since early 2006, but as of 27 July 2006 the parallel (black market) rate has reached Z$550,000 per U.S. dollar. By comparison, 10\u00a0years earlier, the rate of exchange was only Z$9.13 per USD.\nIn August 2006 the RBZ revalued the Zimbabwean Dollar by 1000 ZWD to 1 (revalued) dollar. At the same time Zimbabwe devalued the Zim Dollar by 60% against the USD. New official exchange rate revalued ZWD 250 per USD. The parallel market rate was about revalued ZWD 1,200 to 1,500 per USD (28 September 2006).\nIn November 2006, it was announced that sometime around 1 December there would be a further devaluation and that the official exchange rate would change to revalued ZWD 750 per USD. This never materialized. However, the parallel market immediately reacted to this news with the parallel rate falling to ZWD 2,000 per USD (18 November 2006) and by year end it had fallen to ZWD 3,000 per USD.\nOn 1 April 2007, the parallel market was asking ZWD 30,000 for US$1. By year end, it was down to about ZWD 2,000,000. On 18 January 2008, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe began to issue higher denomination ZWD bearer cheques (a banknote with an expiry date), including $10\u00a0million bearer cheques \u2013 each of which was worth less than US$1.35 (70p Sterling; 0.90 Euro) on the parallel market at the time of first issue. On 4 April 2008 the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe introduced new $25\u00a0million and $50\u00a0million bearer cheques. At the time of first issue they were worth US$0.70 and US$1.40 on the parallel market respectively.\nOn 1 May 2008, the RBZ announced that the dollar would be allowed to float in value subject to some conditions.\nOn 6 May 2008, the RBZ issued new $100\u00a0million and $250\u00a0million bearer cheques. At the date of first issue the $250\u00a0million bearer cheque was worth approximately US$1.30 on the parallel market. On 15 May 2008, a new $500\u00a0million bearer cheque was issued by the RBZ. At the time of the first issue it was worth US$1.93. In a widely unreported parallel move, on 15 May 2008, the RBZ issued three \"special agro-cheques\" with face values $5\u00a0billion (at time of first issue \u2013 $19.30), $25\u00a0billion ($96.50) and $50\u00a0billion ($193). It is further reported that the new agro-cheques can be used to buy any goods and services like the bearer cheques.\nOn 30 July 2008, the Governor of the RBZ, Gideon Gono announced that the Zimbabwe dollar would be redenominated by removing 10 zeroes, with effect from 1 August 2008. ZWD10billion became 1\u00a0dollar after the redenomination.\nMore banknotes were issued since Gono vowed to continue printing money: $10,000 and $20,000 (29 September); $50,000 (13 October); $100,000, $500,000 and $1\u00a0million (3 November); $10\u00a0million (2 December); $50\u00a0million and $100\u00a0million (4 December); $200\u00a0million (9 December); $500\u00a0million (11 December); $10\u00a0billion (19 December); $1\u00a0trillion (17 January 2009).\nOn February 2, 2009, a final denomination was implemented, cutting 12 zeroes, before the Zimbabwe dollar was officially abandoned on April 12, 2009. Pending economic recovery, Zimbabwe relied on foreign currency rather than introducing a new currency.\nDollarization: 2009\u2013present.\nIn February 2009, the newly installed national unity government (which included the opposition to Mugabe) allowed foreign currency transactions throughout the economy as a measure to stimulate the economy and end inflation. The Zimbabwean dollar quickly lost all credibility, and by April 2009, the Zimbabwean dollar was suspended entirely, to be replaced by the US dollar in government transactions. In 2014 there were eight legal currencies \u2013 US dollar, South African rand, Botswana pula, British pound sterling, Australian dollar, Chinese yuan, Indian rupee and Japanese yen.\nDollarization reversed inflation, permitting the banking system to stabilize and the economy to resume slow growth after 2009. Dollarization also had other consequences, including:\nIn January, 2013 Finance Minister Tendai Biti announced that Zimbabwe's national public account held just $217. The election budget for the July 2013 presidential election was $104 million and government budget for 2013 was $3.09 billion at a projected economic growth of 5 per cent. The Economist described the 2013 election as \"rigged\" and how, after regaining full control of the government, the Mugabe government doubled the civil service and embarked on \"...misrule and dazzling corruption.\"\nIn August 2014, Zimbabwe began selling treasury bills and bonds to pay public sector salaries that have been delayed as GDP growth weakens while the economy experiences deflation. US$2 million was sold in July through private placements of Six-month Treasury bills at an interest rate of 9.5%. According to IMF data, GDP growth was forecast to be 3.1% by the end of 2014, a major decline from an average rate of 10% between 2009 and 2012, while government data showed that consumer prices declined for five consecutive months by the end of June. The Reserve Bank continued to issue large values of treasury bills to support the government's over-budget spending. This added to the money supply and in effect devalued all bank balances, despite them being US Dollar denominated.\nIn November 2016 a pseudo-currency was issued in the form of Bond Notes despite widespread protests against them. In February 2019, John Mangudya, through a monetary policy presentation formally introduced a new currency, the RTGS dollar which consists of electronic balances in banks and mobile wallets, bond notes and bond coins. This completed the conversion of all US Dollar denominated bank balances to a devalued Zimbabwean currency at a rate of 1:1.\nIn June 2019 the use of foreign currencies in local transactions was prohibited as part of the prospective plan for a new national currency and thus ended the dollarization period. There was still low volume trade in US Dollars, particularly in the informal sector and using in-shop bureau de change. In March 2020, blaming the challenges of dealing with COVID-19, the government allowed formal transactions in US Dollars once more. Zimbabwe once more extended its multi-currency system from 2025 until 31 December 2030 in October 2023 as a result of declining trust in the Zimbabwean dollar, which also declined by more than 80% in 2023.\nGovernment of National Unity: 2009\u20132013.\nIn response to the negative long-term economic situation the three parliamentary parties agreed on a Government of National Unity. Despite serious internal differences this government made some important decisions that improved the general economic situation, first of all the suspension of the national currency, the Zimbabwean Dollar, in April 2009. That stopped hyperinflation and made normal forms of business possible again, by using foreign currency such as the US American Dollar, the South African Rand, the EUs Euro or the Botswana Pula. The former finance minister Tendai Biti (MDC-T) tried to hold a disciplined budget. In 2009 Zimbabwe recorded a period of economic growth for the first time in a decade.\nPost-Government of National Unity: 2013\u20132020.\nFollowing ZANU-PF's landslide electoral victory in the 2013 general elections, Patrick Chinamasa was appointed finance minister. Policies encouraging the indigenisation of the economy were fast tracked and laws requiring that 51% or more of non-black Zimbabwean owned companies had to be handed over to black Zimbabweans were implemented. This has been credited with creating further uncertainty in the economy and negatively impacting investment climate in the country. Although legislation dealing with the indigenisation of the Zimbabwean economy has been in development since 2007 and actively initiated by ZANU-PF in 2010 the policy has continued to be accused of being unclear and a form of \"racketeering by regulation.\" The government doubled the civil service and embarked on what the Economist described as \"...misrule and dazzling corruption.\"\nIn April 2014, Chinamasa admitted that the country was heavily in debt and that the country needed to better attract foreign direct investment. Officially Zimbabwe's debt is $7 billion, or over 200% of the country's GDP. However, this figure is disputed, with figures as high as $11 billion being quoted, once debts to other African countries and China are included. As of May 2014, it has been reported that Zimbabwe's economy was in decline following the period of relative economic stability during the Government of National Unity. It is estimated that Zimbabwe's manufacturing sector requires an investment of roughly US$8 billion for working capital and equipment upgrades.\nIn 2016 Tendai Biti, an opposition politician estimated the government was running a deficit of up to 12% of GDP and Zimbabwe began experiencing a significant shortage of US dollars partly due to a consistent trade deficit. This prompted the Zimbabwean government to limit cash withdrawals from banks and change exchange-control regulations in order to try to promote exports and reduce the currency shortage. In June and July 2016, after Government employees had not been paid for weeks, police had set up road blocks to coerce money out of tourists and there were protests throughout Zimbabwe, Patrick Chinamasa, the finance minister, toured Europe in an effort to raise investment capital and loans, admitting \"Right now we have nothing.\" In August 2016 the government announced that it would be laying off 25,000 civil servants (8% of the country's 298,000 civil servants), cut the number of embassies and diplomatic expenses and cut ministerial expenses in an attempt to save $4 billion in annual wages and secure help from the World Bank and the IMF.\nAt the same time, the government sought to improve women's access to microfinance via the Zimbabwe Women Microfinance Bank Limited, which began operations 29 May 2018. The Bank operates under the supervision of the Ministry of Women's Affairs, Gender and Community Development.\nRe-adoption of the Zimbabwe Dollar.\nIn mid-July 2019 inflation had increased to 175% following the adoption of a new Zimbabwe dollar and banning the use of foreign currency thereby sparking fresh concerns that the country was entering a new period of hyperinflation. The Zimbabwean government stopped releasing inflation data in August 2019. The year-on-year inflation rate was 521% in December 2019, but Zimbabwe central bank officials said in February 2020 that they hoped to reduce the figure to 50% by the end of December 2020.\nSources.\n\u00a0This article incorporates text from a free content work.

Within this zodiac belt appear the Moon and the brightest planets, along their orbital planes. The zodiac is divided along the ecliptic into 12 equal parts, called \"signs\", each occupying 30\u00b0 of celestial longitude. These signs roughly correspond to the astronomical constellations with the following modern names: Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. \nThe signs have been used to determine the time of the year by identifying each sign with the days of the year the Sun is in the respective sign. In Western astrology, and formerly astronomy, the time of each sign is associated with different attributes. The zodiacal system and its angular measurement in 360 sexagesimal degree (\u00b0) originated with Babylonian astronomy during the 1st millennium BC, probably during the Achaemenid Empire. It was communicated into Greek astronomy by the 2nd century BC, as well as into developing the Hindu zodiac. Due to the precession of the equinoxes, the time of year that the Sun is in a given constellation has changed since Babylonian times, and the point of March equinox has moved from Aries into Pisces. \nThe zodiac forms a celestial coordinate system, or more specifically an ecliptic coordinate system, which takes the ecliptic as the origin of latitude and the Sun's position at vernal equinox as the origin of longitude. In modern astronomy, the ecliptic coordinate system is still used for tracking Solar System objects.\nName.\nThe English word \"zodiac\" derives from , the Latinized form of the Ancient Greek (), meaning \"of or relating to little animals\", () being the diminutive of (, \"animal\"). The name reflects the prominence of animals (and mythological hybrids) among the twelve signs. In English, the term \"zodiac\" may also be used in reference to or translation for the similar twelve year cycle (also sometimes applied to other time units than years) of the East Asian-derived systems referred to as the Chinese zodiac (see also, Earthly Branches): similarities include the use of animal or theriomorphic figures associated with a twelve year cycle used culturally to allege or describe personality traits, life events, and their interrelationships\u2014thus this use in translation.\nUsage.\nThe zodiac was in use by the Roman era, based on concepts inherited by Hellenistic astronomy from Babylonian astronomy of the Chaldean period (mid-1st millennium BC), which, in turn, derived from an earlier system of lists of stars along the ecliptic. The construction of the zodiac is described in Ptolemy's comprehensive 2nd century AD work, the \"Almagest\".\nAlthough the zodiac remains the basis of the ecliptic coordinate system in use in astronomy besides the equatorial one, the term and the names of the twelve signs are today mostly associated with horoscopic astrology. The term \"zodiac\" may also refer to the region of the celestial sphere encompassing the paths of the planets corresponding to the band of about 8 arc degrees above and below the ecliptic. The zodiac of a given planet is the band that contains the path of that particular body; e.g., the \"zodiac of the Moon\" is the band of 5\u00b0 above and below the ecliptic. By extension, the \"zodiac of the comets\" may refer to the band encompassing most short-period comets.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nAs early as the 14th century BC a complete list of the 36 Egyptian decans was placed among the hieroglyphs adorning the tomb of Seti I; they figured again in the temple of Ramesses II, and characterize every Egyptian astrological monument. Both the famous zodiacs of Dendera display their symbols, identified by Karl Richard Lepsius.\nThe division of the ecliptic into the zodiacal signs originates in Babylonian astronomy during the first half of the 1st millennium BC. The zodiac draws on stars in earlier Babylonian star catalogues, such as the MUL.APIN catalogue, which was compiled around 1000 BC. Some constellations can be traced even further back, to Bronze Age (Old Babylonian Empire) sources, including Gemini \"The Twins\", from \"The Great Twins\"; Cancer \"The Crab\", from \"The Crayfish\", among others.\nAround the end of the fifth century BC, Babylonian astronomers divided the ecliptic into 12 equal \"signs\", by analogy to 12 schematic months of 30 days each. Each sign contained 30\u00b0 of celestial longitude, thus creating the first known celestial coordinate system. According to calculations by modern astrophysics, the zodiac was introduced between 409 and 398 BC, during Persian rule, and probably within a very few years of 401 BC. Unlike modern astrologers, who place the beginning of the sign of Aries at the position of the Sun at the vernal equinox in the Northern Hemisphere (March equinox), Babylonian astronomers fixed the zodiac in relation to stars, placing the beginning of Cancer at the \"Rear Twin Star\" (\u03b2 Geminorum) and the beginning of Aquarius at the \"Rear Star of the Goat-Fish\" (\u03b4 Capricorni).\nDue to the precession of the equinoxes, the time of year the Sun is in a given constellation has changed since Babylonian times, as the point of March equinox has moved from Aries into Pisces.\nBecause the divisions were made into equal arcs of 30\u00b0 each, they constituted an ideal system of reference for making predictions about a planet's longitude. However, Babylonian techniques of observational measurements were in a rudimentary stage of evolution. They measured the position of a planet in reference to a set of \"normal stars\" close to the ecliptic (\u00b19\u00b0 of latitude). The normal stars were used as observational reference points to help position a planet within this ecliptic coordinate system.\nIn Babylonian astronomical diaries, a planet position was generally given with respect to a zodiacal sign alone, though less often in specific degrees within a sign. When the degrees of longitude were given, they were expressed with reference to the 30\u00b0 of the zodiacal sign, i.e., not with a reference to the continuous 360\u00b0 ecliptic. In astronomical ephemerides, the positions of significant astronomical phenomena were computed in sexagesimal fractions of a degree (equivalent to minutes and seconds of arc). For daily ephemerides, the daily positions of a planet were not as important as the astrologically significant dates when the planet crossed from one zodiacal sign to the next.\nHebrew astronomy and astrology.\nKnowledge of the Babylonian zodiac is said to be reflected in the Hebrew Bible; E. W. Bullinger interpreted the creatures that appear in the book of Ezekiel (1:10) as the middle signs of the four quarters of the zodiac, with the Lion as Leo, the Bull as Taurus, the Man as Aquarius and the Eagle as a higher aspect of Scorpio. Some authors have linked the signs of the zodiac with the twelve tribes of Israel, and with the lunar Hebrew calendar, which has twelve lunar months in a lunar year. Martin and others have argued that the arrangement of the tribes around the Tabernacle (reported in the Book of Numbers) corresponded to the order of the zodiac, with Judah, Reuben, Ephraim, and Dan representing the middle signs of Leo, Aquarius, Taurus, and Scorpio, respectively. Such connections were taken up by Thomas Mann, who in his novel \"Joseph and His Brothers\", attributes characteristics of a sign of the zodiac to each tribe, in his rendition of the Blessing of Jacob.\nHellenistic and Roman era.\nThe Babylonian star catalogs entered Greek astronomy in the 4th century BC, via Eudoxus of Cnidus.\nBabylonia or Chaldea in the Hellenistic world came to be so identified with astrology that \"Chaldean wisdom\" became among Greeks and Romans the synonym of divination through the planets and stars. Hellenistic astrology derived in part from Babylonian and Egyptian astrology. Horoscopic astrology first appeared in Ptolemaic Egypt (305 BC\u201330 BC). The Dendera zodiac, a relief dating to c.\u200950 BC, is the first known depiction of the classical zodiac of twelve signs.\nThe earliest extant Greek text using the Babylonian division of the zodiac into 12 signs of 30 equal degrees each is the \"Anaphoricus\" of Hypsicles of Alexandria (fl.190BC). Particularly important in the development of Western horoscopic astrology was the astrologer and astronomer Ptolemy, whose work \"Tetrabiblos\" laid the basis of the Western astrological tradition. Under the Greeks, and Ptolemy in particular, the planets, Houses, and signs of the zodiac were rationalized and their function set down in a way that has changed little to the present day. Ptolemy lived in the 2nd century AD, three centuries after the discovery of the precession of the equinoxes by Hipparchus around 130 BC. Hipparchus' lost work on precession never circulated very widely until it was brought to prominence by Ptolemy, and there are few explanations of precession outside the work of Ptolemy until late Antiquity, by which time Ptolemy's influence was widely established. Ptolemy clearly explained the theoretical basis of the western zodiac as being a tropical coordinate system, by which the zodiac is aligned to the equinoxes and solstices, rather than the visible constellations that bear the same names as the zodiac signs.\nHindu zodiac.\nAccording to mathematician-historian Montucla, the Hindu zodiac was adopted from the Greek zodiac through communications between ancient India and the Greek empire of Bactria. The Hindu zodiac uses the sidereal coordinate system, which makes reference to the fixed stars. The tropical zodiac (of Mesopotamian origin) is divided by the intersections of the ecliptic and equator, which shifts in relation to the backdrop of fixed stars at a rate of 1\u00b0 every 72 years, creating the phenomenon known as precession of the equinoxes. The Hindu zodiac, being sidereal, does not maintain this seasonal alignment, but there are still similarities between the two systems. The Hindu zodiac signs and corresponding Greek signs sound very different, being in Sanskrit and Greek respectively, but their symbols are nearly identical. For example, \"dhanu\" means \"bow\" and corresponds to Sagittarius, the \"archer\", and \"kumbha\" means \"water-pitcher\" and corresponds to Aquarius, the \"water-carrier\".\nMiddle Ages.\nDuring the Abbasid era, Greek reference books were translated into Arabic, and Islamic astronomers then did their own observations, correcting Ptolemy's Almagest. One such book was Al-Sufi's \"Book of Fixed Stars\", which has pictorial depictions of 48 constellations. The book was divided into three sections: constellations of the zodiac, constellations north of the zodiac, and southern constellations. When Al-Sufi's book, and other works, were translated in the 11th century, there were mistakes made in the translations. As a result, some stars ended up with the names of the constellation they belong to (e.g. Hamal in Aries).\nThe High Middle Ages saw a revival of interest in Greco-Roman magic, first in Kabbalism and later continued in Renaissance magic. This included magical uses of the zodiac, as found, e.g., in the Sefer Raziel HaMalakh.\nThe zodiac is found in medieval stained glass as at Angers Cathedral, where the master glass maker, Andr\u00e9 Robin, made the ornate rosettes for the North and South transepts after the fire there in 1451.\nMedieval Islamic era.\nAstrology emerged in the 8th century AD as a distinct discipline in Islam, with a mix of Indian, Hellenistic Iranian and other traditions blended with Greek and Islamic astronomical knowledge, for example Ptolemy's work and Al-Sufi's Book of Fixed Stars. A knowledge of the influence that the stars have on events on the earth was important in Islamic civilization. As a rule, it was believed that the signs of the zodiac and the planets control the destiny not only of people but also of nations, and that the zodiac has the ability to determine a person's physical characteristics as well as intelligence and personal traits.\nThe practice of astrology at this time could be divided into four broader categories: Genethlialogy, Catarchic Astrology, Interrogational Astrology and General Astrology. However the most common type of astrology was Genethlialogy, which examined all aspects of a person's life in relation to the planetary positions at their birth; more commonly known as our horoscope.\nAstrology services were offered widely across the empire, mainly in bazaars, where people could pay for a reading. Astrology was valued in the royal courts, for example, the Abbasid Caliph Al-Mansur used astrology to determine the best date for founding the new capital of Baghdad. While horoscopes were generally widely accepted by society, many scholars condemned the use of astrology and divination, linking it to occult influences. Many theologians and scholars thought that it went against the tenets of Islam; as only God should be able to determine events rather than astrologers looking at the positions of the planets.\nIn order to calculate someone's horoscope, an astrologer would use three tools: an astrolabe, ephemeris and a takht. First, the astrologer would use an astrolabe to find the position of the sun, align the rule with the persons time of birth and then align the rete to establish the altitude of the sun on that date. Next, the astrologer would use an ephemeris, a table denoting the mean position of the planets and stars within the sky at any given time. Finally, the astrologer would add the altitude of the sun taken from the astrolabe, with the mean position of the planets on the person's birthday, and add them together on the takht (also known as the dustboard). The dust board was merely a tablet covered in sand; on which the calculations could be made and erased easily. Once this had been calculated, the astrologer was then able to interpret the horoscope. Most of these interpretations were based on the zodiac in literature. For example, there were several manuals on how to interpret each zodiac sign, the treatise relating to each individual sign and what the characteristics of these zodiacs were.\nEarly modern.\nAn example of the use of signs as astronomical coordinates may be found in the \"Nautical Almanac and Astronomical Ephemeris for the year 1767\". The \"Longitude of the Sun\" columns show the sign (represented as a digit from 0 to and including 11), degrees from 0 to 29, minutes, and seconds.\nMughal king Jahangir issued an attractive series of coins in gold and silver depicting the twelve signs of the zodiac.\nTwelve signs.\nWhat follows is a list of the signs of the modern zodiac (with the ecliptic longitudes of their first points), where 0\u00b0 Aries is understood as the vernal equinox, with their Latin, Greek, Sanskrit, and Babylonian names. But the Sanskrit and the name equivalents (after c.500 BC) denote the constellations only, not the tropical zodiac signs. The \"English translation\" is not usually used by English speakers. The Latin names are standard English usage (except that \"Capricorn\" is used rather than \"Capricornus\").\nThese twelve signs have been arranged into a nursery rhyme as a mnemonic device:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2014\u200a\nAnother mnemonic is \"A Tense Gray Cat Lay Very Low, Sneaking Slowly, Contemplating A Pounce\".\nThe following table compares the Gregorian dates on which the Sun enters a sign in the Ptolemaic tropical zodiac, and a sign in two sidereal systems: one proposed by Cyril Fagan, and a fourteen-sign system proposed by Steven Schmidt which adds Ophiuchus (see below) and Cetus (the IAU boundaries of which just graze by the ecliptic):\nThe beginning of Aries is defined as the moment of vernal equinox, and all other dates shift accordingly.\nThe precise Gregorian times and dates vary slightly from year to year as the Gregorian calendar shifts relative to the tropical year. These variations remain within less than two days' difference in the recent past and the near-future, vernal equinox in UT always falling either on 20 or 21 March in the period of 1797 to 2043, falling on 19 March in 1796 the last time and in 2044 the next. The vernal equinox has fallen on 20 March UT since 2008, and will continue to do so until 2043.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAs each sign takes up exactly 30 degrees of the zodiac, the average duration of the solar stay in each sign is one twelfth of a sidereal year, or 30.43 standard days. Due to Earth's slight orbital eccentricity, the duration of each sign varies appreciably, between about 29.4 days for Capricorn and about 31.4 days for Cancer (see Equation of time). In addition, because the Earth's axis is at an angle, some signs take longer to rise than others, and the farther away from the equator the observer is situated, the greater the difference. Thus, signs are spoken of as \"long\" or \"short\" ascension.\nConstellations.\nIn tropical astrology, the zodiacal signs are distinct from the constellations associated with them, not only because of their drifting apart due to the precession of equinoxes but because the physical constellations take up varying widths of the ecliptic, so the Sun is not in each constellation for the same amount of time. Thus, Virgo takes up 5 times as much ecliptic longitude as Scorpius. The zodiacal signs are an abstraction from the physical constellations, and each represent exactly &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u204412th of the full circle, but the time spent by the Sun in each sign varies slightly due to the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit.\nSidereal astrology assigns the zodiac sign approximately to the corresponding constellation. This alignment needs recalibrating every so often to keep the alignment in place.\nThe ecliptic intersects with 13 constellations of Ptolemy's \"Almagest\", as well as of the more precisely delineated IAU designated constellations. In addition to the twelve constellations after which the twelve zodiac signs are named, the ecliptic intersects Ophiuchus, the bottom part of which interjects between Scorpius and Sagittarius. Occasionally this difference between the astronomical constellations and the astrological signs is mistakenly reported in the popular press as a \"change\" to the list of traditional signs by some astronomical body like the IAU, NASA, or the Royal Astronomical Society. This happened in a 1995 report of the \"BBC Nine O'Clock News\" and various reports in 2011 and 2016.\nSome \"parazodiacal\" constellations are touched by the paths of the planets, leading to counts of up to 25 \"constellations of the zodiac\". The ancient Babylonian MUL.APIN catalog lists Orion, Perseus, Auriga, and Andromeda. Modern astronomers have noted that planets pass through Crater, Sextans, Cetus, Pegasus, Corvus, Hydra, Orion, and Scutum, with Venus very rarely passing through Aquila, Canis Minor, Auriga, and Serpens.\nSome other constellations are mythologically associated with the zodiacal ones: Piscis Austrinus, The Southern Fish, is attached to Aquarius. In classical maps, it swallows the stream poured out of Aquarius' pitcher, but perhaps it formerly just swam in it. Aquila, The Eagle, was possibly associated with the zodiac by virtue of its main star, Altair. Hydra in the Early Bronze Age marked the celestial equator and was associated with Leo, which is shown standing on the serpent on the Dendera zodiac.\nPrecession of the equinoxes.\nThe zodiac system was developed in Babylonia, some 2,500 years ago, during the \"Age of Aries\". At the time, it is assumed, the precession of the equinoxes was unknown. Contemporary use of the coordinate system is presented with the choice of interpreting the system either as sidereal, with the signs fixed to the stellar background, or as tropical, with the signs fixed to the point (vector of the Sun) at the March equinox.\nWestern astrology takes the tropical approach, whereas Hindu astrology takes the sidereal one. This results in the originally unified zodiacal coordinate system drifting apart gradually, with a clockwise (westward) precession of 1.4 degrees per century.\nFor the tropical zodiac used in Western astronomy and astrology, this means that the tropical \"sign\" of Aries currently lies somewhere within the \"constellation\" Pisces (\"Age of Pisces\").\nThe sidereal coordinate system takes into account the ayanamsa, \"ayan\" meaning \"transit\" or \"movement\", and \"amsa\" meaning 'small part', i.e. movement of equinoxes in small parts. It is unclear when Indians became aware of the precession of the equinoxes, but Bh\u0101skara II's 12th-century treatise \"Siddhanta Shiromani\" gives equations for measurement of precession of equinoxes, and says his equations are based on some lost equations of \"Suryasiddhanta\" plus the equation of Munjaala.\nThe discovery of precession is attributed to Hipparchus around 130 BC. Ptolemy quotes from Hipparchus' now-lost work entitled \"On the Displacement of the Solstitial and Equinoctial Points\" in the seventh book of his 2nd century astronomical text, \"Almagest\", where he describes the phenomenon of precession and estimates its value. Ptolemy clarified that the convention of Greek mathematical astronomy was to commence the zodiac from the point of the vernal equinox and to always refer to this point as \"the first degree\" of Aries. This is known as the \"tropical zodiac\" (from the Greek word tr\u00f3pos, turn) because its starting point revolves through the circle of background constellations over time.\nThe principle of the vernal point acting as the first degree of the zodiac for Greek astronomers is described in the 1st century BC astronomical text of Geminus of Rhodes. Geminus explains that Greek astronomers of his era associate the first degrees of the zodiac signs with the two solstices and the two equinoxes, in contrast to the older Chaldean (Babylonian) system, which placed these points within the zodiac signs. This illustrates that Ptolemy merely clarified the convention of Greek astronomers and did not originate the principle of the tropical zodiac, as is sometimes assumed.\nPtolemy demonstrates that the principle of the tropical zodiac was well known to his predecessors within his astrological text, the \"Tetrabiblos\", where he explains why it would be an error to associate the regularly spaced signs of the seasonally aligned zodiac with the irregular boundaries of the visible constellations:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn modern astronomy.\nAstronomically, the zodiac defines a belt of space extending 8\u00b0 or 9\u00b0 in celestial latitude to the north and south of the ecliptic, within which the orbits of the Moon and the principal planets remain. It is a feature of the ecliptic coordinate system \u2013 a celestial coordinate system centered upon the ecliptic (the plane of the Earth's orbit and the Sun's apparent path), by which celestial longitude is measured in degrees east of the vernal equinox (the ascending intersection of the ecliptic and equator). The zodiac is narrow in angular terms because most of the Sun's planets have orbits that have only a slight inclination to the orbital plane of the Earth. Stars within the zodiac are subject to occultations by the Moon and other solar system bodies. These events can be useful, for example, to estimate the cross-sectional dimensions of a minor planet, or check a star for a close companion.\nThe Sun's placement upon the vernal equinox, which occurs annually around 21 March, defines the starting point for measurement, the first degree of which is historically known as the \"first point of Aries\". The first 30\u00b0 along the ecliptic is nominally designated as the zodiac sign Aries, which no longer falls within the proximity of the constellation Aries since the effect of precession is to move the vernal point through the backdrop of visible constellations. It is currently located near the end of the constellation Pisces, having been within that constellation since the 2nd century AD. The subsequent 30\u00b0 of the ecliptic is nominally designated the zodiac sign Taurus, and so on through the twelve signs of the zodiac so that each occupies &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u204412th (30\u00b0) of the zodiac's great circle. Zodiac signs have never been used to determine the boundaries of astronomical constellations that lie in the vicinity of the zodiac, which are, and always have been, irregular in their size and shape.\nThe convention of measuring celestial longitude within individual signs was still being used in the mid-19th century, but modern astronomy now numbers degrees of celestial longitude continuously from 0\u00b0 to 360\u00b0, rather than 0\u00b0 to 30\u00b0 within each sign. This coordinate system is primary used by astronomers for observations of solar system objects.\nThe use of the zodiac as a means to determine astronomical measurement remained the main method for defining celestial positions by Western astronomers until the Renaissance, at which time preference moved to the equatorial coordinate system, which measures astronomical positions by right ascension and declination rather than the ecliptic-based definitions of celestial longitude and celestial latitude. The orientation of equatorial coordinates are aligned with the Earth's axis of rotation, rather than the plane of the planet's orbit around the Sun.\nThe word \"zodiac\" is used in reference to the zodiacal cloud of dust grains that move among the planets, and the zodiacal light that originates from their scattering of sunlight. While its name is derived from the zodiac, the zodiacal light covers the entire night sky, with enhancements in certain directions.\nUnicode characters.\nIn Unicode, the symbols of zodiac signs are encoded in block \"Miscellaneous Symbols\". They can be forced to look like text by appending U+FE0E, or like emojis by appending U+FE0F:\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "34413", "revid": "194203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34413", "title": "Zoology", "text": "Scientific study of animals\nZoology ( , ) is the scientific study of animals. Its studies include the structure, embryology, classification, habits, and distribution of all animals, both living and extinct, and how they interact with their ecosystems. Zoology is one of the primary branches of biology. The term is derived from Ancient Greek , ('animal'), and , ('knowledge', 'study').\nAlthough humans have always been interested in the natural history of the animals they saw around them, and used this knowledge to domesticate certain species, the formal study of zoology can be said to have originated with Aristotle. He viewed animals as living organisms, studied their structure and development, and considered their adaptations to their surroundings and the function of their parts. Modern zoology has its origins during the Renaissance and early modern period, with Carl Linnaeus, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, Robert Hooke, Charles Darwin, Gregor Mendel and many others.\nThe study of animals has largely moved on to deal with form and function, adaptations, relationships between groups, behaviour and ecology. Zoology has increasingly been subdivided into disciplines such as classification, physiology, biochemistry and evolution. With the discovery of the structure of DNA by Francis Crick, James Watson and Rosalind Franklin in 1953, the realm of molecular biology opened up, leading to advances in cell biology, developmental biology and molecular genetics.\nHistory.\nThe history of zoology traces the study of the animal kingdom from ancient to modern times. Prehistoric people needed to study the animals and plants in their environment to exploit them and survive. Cave paintings, engravings and sculptures in France dating back 15,000 years show bison, horses, and deer in carefully rendered detail. Similar images from other parts of the world illustrated mostly the animals hunted for food and the savage animals.\nThe Neolithic Revolution, which is characterized by the domestication of animals, continued throughout Antiquity. Ancient knowledge of wildlife is illustrated by the realistic depictions of wild and domestic animals in the Near East, Mesopotamia, and Egypt, including husbandry practices and techniques, hunting and fishing. The invention of writing is reflected in zoology by the presence of animals in Egyptian hieroglyphics.\nAlthough the concept of \"zoology\" as a single coherent field arose much later, the zoological sciences emerged from natural history reaching back to the biological works of Aristotle and Galen in the ancient Greco-Roman world. In the fourth century BC, Aristotle looked at animals as living organisms, studying their structure, development and vital phenomena. He divided them into two groups: animals with blood, equivalent to our concept of vertebrates, and animals without blood, invertebrates. He spent two years on Lesbos, observing and describing the animals and plants, considering the adaptations of different organisms and the function of their parts. Four hundred years later, Roman physician Galen dissected animals to study their anatomy and the function of the different parts, because the dissection of human cadavers was prohibited at the time. This resulted in some of his conclusions being false, but for many centuries it was considered heretical to challenge any of his views, so the study of anatomy stultified.\nDuring the post-classical era, Middle Eastern science and medicine was the most advanced in the world, integrating concepts from Ancient Greece, Rome, Mesopotamia and Persia as well as the ancient Indian tradition of Ayurveda, while making numerous advances and innovations. In the 13th century, Albertus Magnus produced commentaries and paraphrases of all Aristotle's works; his books on topics like botany, zoology, and minerals included information from ancient sources, but also the results of his own investigations. His general approach was surprisingly modern, and he wrote, \"For it is [the task] of natural science not simply to accept what we are told but to inquire into the causes of natural things.\" An early pioneer was Conrad Gessner, whose monumental 4,500-page encyclopedia of animals, , was published in four volumes between 1551 and 1558.\nIn Europe, Galen's work on anatomy remained largely unsurpassed and unchallenged up until the 16th century. During the Renaissance and early modern period, zoological thought was revolutionized in Europe by a renewed interest in empiricism and the discovery of many novel organisms. Prominent in this movement were Andreas Vesalius and William Harvey, who used experimentation and careful observation in physiology, and naturalists such as Carl Linnaeus, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, and Buffon who began to classify the diversity of life and the fossil record, as well as studying the development and behavior of organisms. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek did pioneering work in microscopy and revealed the previously unknown world of microorganisms, laying the groundwork for cell theory. van Leeuwenhoek's observations were endorsed by Robert Hooke; all living organisms were composed of one or more cells and could not generate spontaneously. Cell theory provided a new perspective on the fundamental basis of life.\nHaving previously been the realm of gentlemen naturalists, over the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, zoology became an increasingly professional scientific discipline. Explorer-naturalists such as Alexander von Humboldt investigated the interaction between organisms and their environment, and the ways this relationship depends on geography, laying the foundations for biogeography, ecology and ethology. Naturalists began to reject essentialism and consider the importance of extinction and the mutability of species.\nThese developments, as well as the results from embryology and paleontology, were synthesized in the 1859 publication of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection; in this Darwin placed the theory of organic evolution on a new footing, by explaining the processes by which it can occur, and providing observational evidence that it had done so. Darwin's theory was rapidly accepted by the scientific community and soon became a central axiom of the rapidly developing science of biology. The basis for modern genetics began with the work of Gregor Mendel on peas in 1865, although the significance of his work was not realized at the time.\nDarwin gave a new direction to morphology and physiology, by uniting them in a common biological theory: the theory of organic evolution. The result was a reconstruction of the classification of animals upon a genealogical basis, fresh investigation of the development of animals, and early attempts to determine their genetic relationships. The end of the 19th century saw the fall of spontaneous generation and the rise of the germ theory of disease, though the mechanism of inheritance remained a mystery. In the early 20th century, the rediscovery of Mendel's work led to the rapid development of genetics, and by the 1930s the combination of population genetics and natural selection in the modern synthesis created evolutionary biology.\nResearch in cell biology is interconnected to other fields such as genetics, biochemistry, medical microbiology, immunology, and cytochemistry. With the determination of the double helical structure of the DNA molecule by Francis Crick and James Watson in 1953, the realm of molecular biology opened up, leading to advances in cell biology, developmental biology and molecular genetics. The study of systematics was transformed as DNA sequencing elucidated the degrees of affinity between different organisms.\nZoology plays a vital role in addressing contemporary environmental challenges, including climate change, habitat destruction, and species extinction. By studying animal diversity and ecosystem interactions, zoologists inform conservation strategies and ecosystem restoration efforts. For example, research into species behavior, genetics, and habitat requirements has directly contributed to the protection of endangered populations and the design of wildlife corridors.\nScope.\nZoology is the branch of science dealing with animals. A species can be defined as the largest group of organisms in which any two individuals of the appropriate sex can produce fertile offspring; about 1.5 million species of animal have been described and it has been estimated that as many as 8 million animal species may exist.\nAn early necessity was to identify the organisms and group them according to their characteristics, differences and relationships, and this is the field of the taxonomist. Originally it was thought that species were immutable, but with the arrival of Darwin's theory of evolution, the field of cladistics came into being, studying the relationships between the different groups or clades. Systematics is the study of the diversification of living forms, the evolutionary history of a group is known as its phylogeny, and the relationship between the clades can be shown diagrammatically in a cladogram.\nAlthough someone who made a scientific study of animals would historically have described themselves as a zoologist, the term has come to refer to those who deal with individual animals, with others describing themselves more specifically as physiologists, ethologists, evolutionary biologists, ecologists, pharmacologists, endocrinologists or parasitologists.\nBranches of zoology.\nAlthough the study of animal life is ancient, its scientific incarnation is relatively modern. This mirrors the transition from natural history to biology at the start of the 19th century. Since Hunter and Cuvier, comparative anatomical study has been associated with morphography, shaping the modern areas of zoological investigation: anatomy, physiology, histology, embryology, teratology and ethology. Modern zoology first arose in German and British universities. In Britain, Thomas Henry Huxley was a prominent figure. His ideas were centered on the morphology of animals. Many consider him the greatest comparative anatomist of the latter half of the 19th century. Similar to Hunter, his courses were composed of lectures and laboratory practical classes in contrast to the previous format of lectures only.\nClassification.\nScientific classification in zoology, is a method by which zoologists group and categorize organisms by biological type, such as genus or species. Biological classification is a form of scientific taxonomy. Modern biological classification has its root in the work of Carl Linnaeus, who grouped species according to shared physical characteristics. These groupings have since been revised to improve consistency with the Darwinian principle of common descent. Molecular phylogenetics, which uses nucleic acid sequence as data, has driven many recent revisions and is likely to continue to do so. Biological classification belongs to the science of zoological systematics.\nMany scientists now consider the five-kingdom system outdated. Modern alternative classification systems generally start with the three-domain system: Archaea (originally Archaebacteria); Bacteria (originally Eubacteria); Eukaryota (including protists, fungi, plants, and animals) These domains reflect whether the cells have nuclei or not, as well as differences in the chemical composition of the cell exteriors.\nFurther, each kingdom is broken down recursively until each species is separately classified. The order is:\nDomain; kingdom; phylum; class; order; family; genus; species. The scientific name of an organism is generated from its genus and species. For example, humans are listed as \"Homo sapiens\". \"Homo\" is the genus, and \"sapiens\" the specific epithet, both of them combined make up the species name. When writing the scientific name of an organism, it is proper to capitalize the first letter in the genus and put all of the specific epithet in lowercase. Additionally, the entire term may be italicized or underlined.\nThe dominant classification system is called the Linnaean taxonomy. It includes ranks and binomial nomenclature. The classification, taxonomy, and nomenclature of zoological organisms is administered by the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. A merging draft, BioCode, was published in 1997 in an attempt to standardize nomenclature, but has yet to be formally adopted.\nVertebrate and invertebrate zoology.\nVertebrate zoology is the biological discipline that consists of the study of vertebrate animals, that is animals with a backbone, such as fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. The various taxonomically oriented disciplines i.e.\nmammalogy, biological anthropology, herpetology, ornithology, and ichthyology seek to identify and classify species and study the structures and mechanisms specific to those groups. The rest of the animal kingdom is dealt with by invertebrate zoology, a vast and very diverse group of animals that includes sponges, echinoderms, tunicates, worms, molluscs, arthropods and many other phyla, but single-celled organisms or protists are not usually included.\nStructural zoology.\nCell biology studies the structural and physiological properties of cells, including their behavior, interactions, and environment. This is done on both the microscopic and molecular levels for single-celled organisms such as bacteria as well as the specialized cells in multicellular organisms such as humans. Understanding the structure and function of cells is fundamental to all of the biological sciences. The similarities and differences between cell types are particularly relevant to molecular biology.\nAnatomy considers the forms of macroscopic structures such as organs and organ systems. It focuses on how organs and organ systems work together in the bodies of humans and other animals, in addition to how they work independently. Anatomy and cell biology are two studies that are closely related, and can be categorized under \"structural\" studies. Comparative anatomy is the study of similarities and differences in the anatomy of different groups. It is closely related to evolutionary biology and phylogeny (the evolution of species).\nPhysiology.\nPhysiology studies the mechanical, physical, and biochemical processes of living organisms by attempting to understand how all of the structures function as a whole. The theme of \"structure to function\" is central to biology. Physiological studies have traditionally been divided into plant physiology and animal physiology, but some principles of physiology are universal, no matter what particular organism is being studied. For example, what is learned about the physiology of yeast cells can also apply to human cells. The field of animal physiology extends the tools and methods of human physiology to non-human species. Physiology studies how, for example, the nervous, immune, endocrine, respiratory, and circulatory systems function and interact.\nDevelopmental biology.\nDevelopmental biology is the study of the processes by which animals and plants reproduce and grow. The discipline includes the study of embryonic development, cellular differentiation, regeneration, asexual and sexual reproduction, metamorphosis, and the growth and differentiation of stem cells in the adult organism. Development of both animals and plants is further considered in the articles on evolution, population genetics, heredity, genetic variability, Mendelian inheritance, and reproduction.\nEvolutionary biology.\nEvolutionary biology is the subfield of biology that studies the evolutionary processes (natural selection, common descent, speciation) that produced the diversity of life on Earth. Evolutionary research is concerned with the origin and descent of species, as well as their change over time, and includes scientists from many taxonomically oriented disciplines. For example, it generally involves scientists who have special training in particular organisms such as mammalogy, ornithology, herpetology, or entomology, but use those organisms as systems to answer general questions about evolution.\nEvolutionary biology is partly based on paleontology, which uses the fossil record to answer questions about the mode and tempo of evolution, and partly on the developments in areas such as population genetics and evolutionary theory. Following the development of DNA fingerprinting techniques in the late 20th century, the application of these techniques in zoology has increased the understanding of animal populations. In the 1980s, developmental biology re-entered evolutionary biology from its initial exclusion from the modern synthesis through the study of evolutionary developmental biology. Related fields often considered part of evolutionary biology are phylogenetics, systematics, and taxonomy.\nEthology.\nEthology is the scientific and objective study of animal behavior under natural conditions, as opposed to behaviorism, which focuses on behavioral response studies in a laboratory setting. Ethologists have been particularly concerned with the evolution of behavior and the understanding of behavior in terms of the theory of natural selection. In one sense, the first modern ethologist was Charles Darwin, whose book, \"The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals,\" influenced many future ethologists.\nA subfield of ethology is behavioral ecology which attempts to answer Nikolaas Tinbergen's four questions with regard to animal behavior: what are the proximate causes of the behavior, the developmental history of the organism, the survival value and phylogeny of the behavior? Another area of study is animal cognition, which uses laboratory experiments and carefully controlled field studies to investigate an animal's intelligence and learning.\nBiogeography.\nBiogeography studies the spatial distribution of organisms on the Earth, focusing on topics like dispersal and migration, plate tectonics, climate change, and cladistics. It is an integrative field of study, uniting concepts and information from evolutionary biology, taxonomy, ecology, physical geography, geology, paleontology and climatology. The origin of this field of study is widely accredited to Alfred Russel Wallace, a British biologist who had some of his work jointly published with Charles Darwin.\nMolecular biology.\nMolecular biology studies the common genetic and developmental mechanisms of animals and plants, attempting to answer the questions regarding the mechanisms of genetic inheritance and the structure of the gene. In 1953, James Watson and Francis Crick described the structure of DNA and the interactions within the molecule, and this publication jump-started research into molecular biology and increased interest in the subject. While researchers practice techniques specific to molecular biology, it is common to combine these with methods from genetics and biochemistry. Much of molecular biology is quantitative, and recently a significant amount of work has been done using computer science techniques such as bioinformatics and computational biology.\nMolecular genetics, the study of gene structure and function, has been among the most prominent sub-fields of molecular biology since the early 2000s. Other branches of biology are informed by molecular biology, by either directly studying the interactions of molecules in their own right such as in cell biology and developmental biology, or indirectly, where molecular techniques are used to infer historical attributes of populations or species, as in fields in evolutionary biology such as population genetics and phylogenetics. There is also a long tradition of studying biomolecules \"from the ground up\", or molecularly, in biophysics.\nReproduction.\nAnimals generally reproduce by sexual reproduction, a process involving the union of a male and female haploid gamete, each gamete formed by meiosis. Ordinarily, gametes produced by separate individuals unite by a process of fertilization to form a diploid zygote that can then develop into a genetically unique individual progeny. However, some animals are also capable, as an alternative reproductive process, to reproduce parthenogenetically. Parthenogenesis has been described in snakes and lizards (see Wikipedia Parthenogenesis in squamates), in amphibians (see Wikipedia Parthenogenesis in amphibians) and in numerous other species (see Wikipedia Parthenogenesis). Generally, meiosis in parthenogenetically reproducing animals occurs by a similar process to that in sexually reproducing animals, but the diploid zygote nucleus is generated by the union of two haploid genomes from the same individual rather than from different individuals.\nAnimal cognition.\nAnimal cognition encompasses the mental processes and abilities of non-human animals, including perception, learning, memory, decision-making, and problem-solving. Research in this field has revealed remarkable cognitive capabilities across diverse species, from the tool use and self-recognition observed in great apes and elephants to the complex communication systems of dolphins and the spatial memory feats of food-caching birds like Clark's nutcracker. Studies have demonstrated that many animals possess forms of consciousness, can understand cause-and-effect relationships, exhibit cultural transmission of behaviors, and show evidence of metacognition\u2014the ability to think about thinking. While debates continue regarding the extent and nature of animal consciousness compared to human cognition, mounting evidence suggests that cognitive abilities exist on a continuum rather than representing a sharp divide between humans and other species. Modern research methods, including neuroimaging and carefully controlled behavioral experiments, continue to expand our understanding of how different species process information and navigate their environments, challenging traditional anthropocentric views of intelligence and consciousness.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is located in the Indian Ocean, and consists of many small islands and two large ones: Unguja (the main island, referred to informally as Zanzibar) and Pemba Island. The capital is Zanzibar City, located on the island of Unguja. Its historic centre, Stone Town, is a World Heritage Site.\nZanzibar is also a semi-autonomous region that united with Tanganyika in 1964 to form the present-day United Republic of Tanzania. The archipelago's main industries are spices, raffia, and tourism. The main spices produced are clove, nutmeg, cinnamon, coconut, and black pepper. The Zanzibar Archipelago, together with Tanzania's Mafia Island, is sometimes referred to locally as the \"Spice Islands\". Tourism in Zanzibar is a more recent activity, driven by government promotion that caused an increase from 19,000 tourists in 1985, to 376,000 in 2016. The islands are accessible via five ports and the Abeid Amani Karume International Airport, which can serve up to 1.5 million passengers per year.\nZanzibar's marine ecosystem plays a vital role in its fishing and algacultural industries; these ecosystems act as nurseries for populations. Moreover, the land ecosystem is the home of the endemic Zanzibar red colobus, the Zanzibar servaline genet, and the extinct or rare Zanzibar leopard. Environmental pressure from the tourism and fishing industries, as well as larger threats such as sea level rise caused by climate change, are creating increasing environmental concerns throughout the region.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"Zanzibar\" came from Arabic \"zanjib\u0101r\" ( ), which is in turn from Persian \"zangb\u00e2r\" ( ), a compound of \"Zang\" ( , \"black\") + \"b\u00e2r\" ( , \"coast\"), cf. the Sea of Zanj. The name is one of several toponyms sharing similar etymologies, ultimately meaning \"land of the blacks\" or similar meanings, in reference to the dark skin of the inhabitants.\nHistory.\nBefore 1498.\nThe presence of microliths suggests that Zanzibar has been home to humans for at least 20,000 years, since the beginning of the Later Stone Age.\n\"Periplus of the Erythraean Sea\", a Greco-Roman text written between the 1st and 3rd centuries, mentioned the island of \"Menuthias\" (), which is likely Unguja.\nAt the outset of the first millennium, both Zanzibar and the adjacent coast were settled by Bantu speakers. Archaeological finds at Fukuchani, on the northwest coast of Zanzibar, indicate a settled agricultural and fishing community from the 6th century at the latest. The considerable amount of daub discovered indicates timber buildings; shell beads, bead grinders, and iron slag have been found at the site as well. There is evidence of limited engagement in long-distance trade: a small amount of imported pottery has been found, less than 1% of total pottery finds, mostly from the Gulf and dated to the 5th to 8th century. The similarity to contemporary sites in Mkokotoni and Dar es Salaam indicates a unified group of communities that independently developed into a center of coastal maritime culture. The coastal towns appear to have been engaged in Indian Ocean and inland African trade at this early period. Trade rapidly increased in importance and quantity beginning in the mid-8th century; by the close of the 10th century, Zanzibar was one of the central Swahili trading towns.\nExcavations at nearby Pemba Island, as well as at Shanga in the Lamu Archipelago, provide the clearest picture of the region's architectural development. Houses were originally built with timber (circa 1050) and later in mud with coral walls (circa 1150). The houses were continuously rebuilt with more permanent materials. By the 13th century, houses were built with stone, and bonded with mud, and the 14th century saw the use of lime to bond stone. Only the wealthier patricians would have had stone- and lime-built houses, and the strength of the materials allowed for flat roofs. By contrast, the majority of the population lived in single-story thatched houses similar to those of the 11th and 12th centuries. According to Thomas Spear, John Middleton, and Mark Horton, the architectural style of these stone houses has no Arab or Persian elements, and should be viewed as an entirely indigenous development of local vernacular architecture. While much of Zanzibar Town's architecture was rebuilt during Omani rule, nearby sites elucidate the general development of Swahili and Zanzibari architecture before the 15th century.\nFrom the 9th century, Swahili merchants on Zanzibar operated as brokers for long-distance traders from both the hinterland and the Indian Ocean world. Persian, Indian, and Arab traders frequented Zanzibar to acquire East African goods like gold, ivory, and ambergris and then shipped them overseas to Asia. Similarly, caravan traders from the African Great Lakes and Zambezian Region came to the coast to trade for imported goods, especially Indian cloth. Before the Portuguese arrival, the southern towns of Unguja Ukuu and Kizimkazi and the northern town of Tumbatu were the dominant centres of exchange. Zanzibar was just one of the many autonomous city-states that dotted the East African coast. These towns grew in wealth as the Swahili people served as intermediaries and facilitators to merchants and traders. This interaction between Central African and Indian Ocean cultures contributed in part to the evolution of the Swahili culture, which developed an Arabic-script literary tradition. Although a Bantu language, the Swahili language as a consequence today includes some borrowed elements, particularly loanwords from Arabic, though this was mostly a 19th-century phenomenon with the growth of Omani hegemony. Many foreign traders from Africa and Asia married into wealthy patrician families on Zanzibar. Asian men in particular, who resided on the coast for up to six months because of the prevailing monsoon wind patterns, married East African women. Since almost all the Asian traders were Muslims, their children inherited their paternal ethnic identity, though East African matrilineal traditions remained key.\nPortuguese colonization.\nVasco da Gama's visit in 1498 marked the beginning of European influence. In 1503 or 1504, Zanzibar became part of the Portuguese Empire when Captain Rui Louren\u00e7o Ravasco Marques came ashore and received tribute from the sultan in exchange for peace. Zanzibar remained a possession of Portugal for almost two centuries. It initially became part of the Portuguese province of Arabia and Ethiopia and was administered by a governor-general. Around 1571, Zanzibar became part of the western division of the Portuguese empire and was administered from Mozambique. It appears, however, that the Portuguese did not closely administer Zanzibar. The first English ship to visit Unguja, the \"Edward Bonaventure\" in 1591, found that there was no Portuguese fort or garrison. The extent of their occupation was a trade depot where produce was bought and collected for shipment to Mozambique. \"In other respects, the affairs of the island were managed by the local 'king', the predecessor of the Mwinyi Mkuu of Dunga.\" This hands-off approach ended when Portugal established a fort on Pemba Island around 1635 in response to the Sultan of Mombasa's slaughter of Portuguese residents several years earlier. Portugal had long considered Pemba to be a troublesome launching point for rebellions in Mombasa against Portuguese rule.\nThe precise origins of the sultans of Unguja are uncertain. However, their capital at Unguja Ukuu is believed to have been an extensive town. Possibly constructed by locals, it was composed mainly of perishable materials.\nSultanate of Zanzibar.\nThe Portuguese arrived in East Africa in 1498, where they found several independent towns on the coast, with Muslim Arabic-speaking elites. While the Portuguese travellers describe them as \"black\", they made a clear distinction between the Muslim and non-Muslim populations. Their relations with these leaders were mostly hostile, but during the sixteenth century, they firmly established their power and ruled with the aid of tributary sultans. The Portuguese presence was relatively limited, leaving administration in the hands of the local leaders and power structures already present. This system lasted until 1631, when the Sultan of Mombasa massacred the Portuguese inhabitants. For the remainder of their rule, the Portuguese appointed European governors. The strangling of trade and diminished local power led the Swahili elites in Mombasa and Zanzibar to invite Omani aristocrats to assist them in driving the Europeans out.\nIn 1698, Zanzibar came under the influence of the Sultanate of Oman. There was a brief revolt against Omani rule in 1784. Local elites invited Omani merchant princes to settle in Zanzibar in the first half of the nineteenth century, preferring them to the Portuguese. Many locals today continue to emphasise that indigenous Zanzibaris had invited Seyyid Said, the first Busaidi sultan, to their island. Claiming a patron\u2013client relationship with powerful families was a strategy used by many Swahili coast towns from at least the fifteenth century.\nIn 1832 or 1840 (the date varies among sources), Said bin Sultan, Sultan of Muscat and Oman moved his capital from Muscat, Oman to Stone Town. After Said's death in June 1856, two of his sons, Thuwaini bin Said and Majid bin Said, struggled over the succession. Said's will divided his dominions into two separate principalities, with Thuwaini to become the Sultan of Oman and Majid to become the first Sultan of Zanzibar; the brothers quarrelled about the will, which was eventually upheld by Charles Canning, 1st Earl Canning, Great Britain's Viceroy and Governor-General of India.\nUntil around 1890, the sultans of Zanzibar controlled a substantial portion of the Swahili coast known as Zanj, which included Mombasa and Dar es Salaam. Beginning in 1886, Great Britain and Germany agreed to allocate parts of the Zanzibar sultanate for their own empires. In October 1886, a British-German border commission established the Zanj as a strip along most of the African Great Lakes region's coast, an area stretching from Cape Delgado (now in Mozambique) to Kipini (now in Kenya), including Mombasa and Dar es Salaam. Over the next few years, most of the mainland territory was incorporated into German East Africa.\nThe sultans developed an economy of trade and cash crops in the Zanzibar Archipelago with a ruling Arab elite. Ivory was a major trade good. The archipelago, sometimes referred to by locals as the Spice Islands, was famous worldwide for its cloves and other spices, and plantations were established to grow them. The archipelago's commerce gradually fell into the hands of traders from the Indian subcontinent, whom Said bin Sultan encouraged to settle on the islands.\nDuring his 14-year reign as sultan, Majid bin Said consolidated his power around the East African slave trade. Malindi in Zanzibar City was the Swahili Coast's main port for the slave trade with the Middle East. In the mid-19th century, as many as 50,000 slaves passed annually through the port.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOne of Majid's brothers, Barghash bin Said, succeeded him, developing Unguja's infrastructure. Another brother of Majid, Khalifa bin Said, was the third sultan of Zanzibar and deepened the relationship with the British, leading to the archipelago's progress towards the abolition of slavery.\nBritish protectorate.\nControl of Zanzibar gradually came into the hands of the British Empire; motivated both by a desire to control Zanzibar's clove and ivory exports, and in accordance with the 19th century movement for the abolition of the slave trade.\nIn 1822, Captain Moresby, the British consul in Muscat, pressed Sultan Said to end the slave trade by signing the Moresby Treaty, the first of a series of anti-slavery treaties with Britain. It prohibited slave transport south and east of the Moresby Line, from Cape Delgado in Africa to Diu Head on the coast of India. Said lost the revenue he would have received as duty on all slaves sold, so to make up for this shortfall, he encouraged the development of the slave trade in Zanzibar itself. However, Said came under increasing pressure from the British to abolish slavery entirely. In 1842, Britain told Said it wished to abolish the slave trade to Arabia, Oman, Persia, and the Red Sea.\nShips from the Royal Navy were employed to enforce the anti-slavery treaties by capturing any dhows carrying slaves. However, with only four ships patrolling a huge swath of sea, the British navy were unable to prevent ships from France, Spain, Portugal, and America continuing to carry slaves. By 1856, Sultan Majid had consolidated his power around the African Great Lakes slave trade. But in 1873, British consul Sir John Kirk threatened Majid's successor, Sultan Barghash, with a total blockade of Zanzibar, forcing Barghash to reluctantly sign the Anglo-Zanzibari treaty. This abolished the slave trade, closed all slave markets, and protected liberated slaves in the Sultan's territories.\nIn 1890, the German Empire, the nearest relevant colonial power, signed the 1890 Heligoland\u2013Zanzibar Treaty with Britain, formally agreeing to \"recognize the British protectorate over\u2026 the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba\".This allowed Zanzibar to become an official protectorate of Britain. This meant that the territory remained under the de jure rule of the Sultan of Zanzibar, under the 'protection' of the British Crown, which exercised formal control over military and foreign affairs, and informal control over domestic areas through the appointment of British advisors. Prime Minister Salisbury explained the British position:\nThe condition of a protected dependency is more acceptable to the half-civilised races, and more suitable for them than direct dominion. It is cheaper, simpler, less wounding to their self-esteem, gives them more career as public officials, and spares them unnecessary contact with white men.\nFrom 1890 to 1913, traditional viziers remained in charge, supervised by advisers appointed by the Colonial Office. In 1913, direct rule was implemented through British residents who were effectively governors. The death of the pro-British Sultan Hamad bin Thuwaini on 25 August 1896 (amidst rumours of poison) and the succession of Sultan Khalid bin Barghash, whom the British did not approve of, led to the Anglo-Zanzibar War. On the morning of 27 August 1896, the Royal Navy destroyed the Beit al Hukum Palace. A cease-fire was declared 38 minutes later and, to this day, the bombardment stands as the shortest war in history. Khalid was overthrown and the British-approved Sultan Hamoud was placed on the throne.\nZanzibar revolution and merger with Tanganyika.\nOn 10 December 1963, the Protectorate that had existed over Zanzibar since 1890 was terminated by the United Kingdom. Rather, by the Zanzibar Act 1963 of the United Kingdom, the UK ended the Protectorate and made provision for full self-government in Zanzibar as an independent country within the Commonwealth. Upon the Protectorate being abolished, Zanzibar became a constitutional monarchy within the Commonwealth under the Sultan.\nHowever, just a month later, on 12 January 1964 Sultan Jamshid bin Abdullah was deposed during the Zanzibar Revolution. The Sultan fled into exile, and the Sultanate was replaced by the People's Republic of Zanzibar, a socialist government led by the Afro-Shirazi Party (ASP). Over 20,000 people were killed \u2013 mostly Arabs and Indians \u2013 and many of them escaped the country as a consequence of the revolution.\nIn April 1964, the republic merged with mainland Tanganyika. This United Republic of Tanganyika and Zanzibar was soon renamed, blending the two names, as the United Republic of Tanzania, within which Zanzibar remains an autonomous region.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe 2022 census is the most recent census for which results have been reported. The total population of Zanzibar was 1,889,773 people, with an annual growth rate of 3.8 percent. The population of Zanzibar City, which was the largest city, was 219,007.\nIn 2002, around two-thirds of the people, 622,459, lived on Unguja (Zanzibar Island), with most settled in the densely populated west. Besides Zanzibar City, other towns on Unguja include Chaani, Mbweni, Mangapwani, Chwaka, and Nungwi. Outside of these towns, most people live in small villages and are engaged in farming or fishing.\nThe population of Pemba Island was 362,166. The largest town on the island was Chake-Chake, with a population of 19,283. The smaller towns are Wete and Mkoani.\nMafia Island, the other major island of the Zanzibar Archipelago, but administered by mainland Tanzania (Tanganyika), had a total population of 40,801.\nEthnic origins.\nThe people of Zanzibar are of diverse ethnic origins. The first permanent residents of Zanzibar seem to have been the ancestors of the Bantu Hadimu and Tumbatu, who began arriving from the African Great Lakes mainland around AD 1000. They belonged to various mainland ethnic groups and, on Zanzibar, generally lived in small villages. They did not coalesce to form larger political units.\nDuring Zanzibar's brief period of independence in the early 1960s, the major political cleavage was between the Shirazi (Zanzibar Africans), who made up approximately 56% of the population, and the Zanzibar Arabs\u2014the bulk of whom arrived from Oman in the 1800s\u2014made up approximately 17%. Today, Zanzibar is inhabited mostly by ethnic Swahili. There are also a number of Arabs, as well as some ethnic Persian, Somalis, and Indian people.\nLanguages.\nSwahili.\nZanzibaris speak Swahili (Kiswahili), a Bantu language that is extensively spoken in the African Great Lakes region. Swahili is the de facto national and official language of Tanzania. Many local residents also speak Arabic, English, Italian and French. \nThe dialect of Swahili spoken in Zanzibar is called Kiunguja. Kiunguja, which has a high percentage of Arabic loanwords, has the status of Standard Swahili not only in Tanzania but also in other countries, where Swahili is spoken.\nArabic.\nThree distinct varieties of Arabic are in use in Zanzibar: Standard Arabic, Omani Arabic, and Hadrami Arabic. Both vernacular varieties are falling out of use, although the Omani one is spoken by a larger group of people (probably several hundred). In parallel to this, Standard Arabic, traditionally associated with the Quran and Islam, is very popular not only among ethnic Arabs but also among Muslims of various descent who inhabit Zanzibar. Nevertheless, Standard Arabic is mastered by very few people. This can be attributed to the aggressive policy of Swahilisation. The Arabic language is no longer the dominant spoken language.\nReligion.\nZanzibar's population is almost entirely Muslim, with a small Christian minority of around 22 000. Other religious groups include Hindus, Jains and Sikhs.\nThe Anglican Diocese of Zanzibar was founded in 1892. The first Bishop of Zanzibar was Charles Smythies, who was translated from his former post as Bishop of Nyasaland.\nChrist Church Cathedral had fallen into poor condition by the late 20th century, but it was fully restored in 2016, for one million Euros, with a world heritage visitor centre. The restoration was supported by the Tanzanian and Zanzibari governments, and overseen by the diocese in partnership with the World Monuments Fund. The restoration of the spire, clock, and historic Willis organ are still outstanding. Historically, the diocese included mainland locations in Tanganyika. In 1963, it was renamed as the Diocese of Zanzibar &amp; Dar es Salaam. Two years later, in 1965, Dar es Salaam became a separate diocese. The original jurisdiction was renamed as the Diocese of Zanzibar &amp; Tanga. In 2001, the mainland links were finally ended, and it is now known as the Diocese of Zanzibar. The diocese includes parishioners on the neighbouring island of Pemba. Ten bishops have served in the diocese from 1892 to the present day. The bishop is Michael Hafidh. It is part of the Province of Tanzania, under the Archbishop of All Tanzania, based at Dodoma.\nThe Roman Catholic Diocese of Zanzibar, with its headquarters at the St. Joseph's Cathedral in Stone Town, was established in 1980. An apostolic vicariate of Zanzibar had been established in 1906 from a much larger East African jurisdiction. This was suppressed in 1953, when the territory was put under the control of the Kenyan church, but it was restored in 1964 after independence. The Catholic Church created a diocese here shortly before Easter 1980. The bishop is Augustine Ndeliakyama Shao. Zanzibar is part of the Roman Catholic Province of Dar es Salaam, under the Archbishop of Dar es Salaam.\nOther Christian denominations include the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Tanzania, which arrived in Zanzibar town in the 1960s, and a wide range of Pentecostal-Charismatic Christian churches such as the Tanzania Assemblies of God, the Free Pentecostal Church of Tanzania, the Evangelical Assemblies of God, the Pentecostal Church of Tanzania, the Victory Church, and the Pentecostal Evangelistic Fellowship of Africa. Pentecostal-Charismatic churches have been present and growing in Zanzibar since the 1980s in relation to economic liberalization and increased labour migration from mainland Tanzania in connection with Zanzibar's expanding tourist sector. There are also Seventh Day Adventist and Baptist churches.\nSince 2005, there is also an inter-religious body called the Joint Committee of Religious Leaders for Peace (in Swahili \"Juhudi za Viongozi wa Dini kuimarisha Amani\") with representatives from Muslim institutions such as the Islamic law (\"Kadhi\" courts), religious property (the \"Wakf\" and Trust commission), education (the Muslim academy) and the \"Mufti\"'s office as well as representatives from the Roman Catholic, the Anglican and the Lutheran church.\nThe places of worship in the city are predominantly Muslim mosques. There are also Christian churches and temples: Roman Catholic Diocese of Zanzibar (Catholic Church), Anglican Church of Tanzania (Anglican Communion), Evangelical Lutheran Church in Tanzania (Lutheran World Federation), Baptist Convention of Tanzania (Baptist World Alliance), Assemblies of God.\nGovernment.\nAs an autonomous part of Tanzania, Zanzibar has its own government, known as the Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar. It is made up of the Revolutionary Council and House of Representatives.\nThe House of Representatives has a similar composition to the National Assembly of Tanzania. Fifty members are elected directly from constituencies to serve five-year terms; 10 members are appointed by the President of Zanzibar; 15 special seats are for women members of political parties that have representation in the House of Representatives; six members serve \"ex officio\", including all regional commissioners and the attorney general. Five of these 81 members are then elected to represent Zanzibar in the National Assembly.\nZanzibar spans 5 of the 31 regions of Tanzania. Unguja has three administrative regions: Zanzibar Central/South, Zanzibar North and Zanzibar Urban/West. Pemba has two: Pemba North and Pemba South.\nConcerning the independence and sovereignty of Zanzibar, Tanzania's Prime Minister Mizengo Pinda said on 3 July 2008 that there was \"nothing like the sovereignty of Zanzibar in the Union Government unless the Constitution is changed in the future\". Zanzibar House of Representatives members from both the ruling party, Chama Cha Mapinduzi, and the opposition party, Civic United Front, disagreed and stood firmly in recognizing Zanzibar as a fully autonomous state.\nPolitics.\nZanzibar has a government of national unity, with the president of Zanzibar being Hussein Ali Mwinyi, since 1 November 2020. There are many political parties in Zanzibar, but the most popular parties are the Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) and the Civic United Front (CUF). Since the early 1990s, the politics of the archipelago have been marked by repeated clashes between these two parties.\nContested elections in October 2000 led to a massacre on 27 January 2001 when, according to Human Rights Watch, the army and police shot into crowds of protestors, killing at least 35 and wounding more than 600. Those forces, accompanied by ruling party officials and militias, also went on a house-to-house rampage, indiscriminately arresting, beating, and sexually abusing residents. Approximately 2,000 temporarily fled to Kenya.\nViolence erupted again after another contested election on 31 October 2005, with the CUF claiming that its rightful victory had been stolen from it. Nine people were killed.\nFollowing 2005, negotiations between the two parties aiming at the long-term resolution of the tensions and a power-sharing accord took place, but they suffered repeated setbacks. The most notable of these took place in April 2008, when the CUF walked away from the negotiating table following a CCM call for a referendum to approve what had been presented as a done deal on the power-sharing agreement.\nIn November 2009, the then-president of Zanzibar, Amani Abeid Karume, met with CUF secretary-general Seif Sharif Hamad at the State House to discuss how to save Zanzibar from future political turmoil and to end the animosity between them. This move was welcomed by many, including the United States. It was the first time since the multi-party system was introduced in Zanzibar that the CUF agreed to recognize Karume as the legitimate president of Zanzibar.\nA proposal to amend Zanzibar's constitution to allow rival parties to form governments of national unity was adopted by 66.2 percent of voters on 31 July 2010.\nThe autonomous status of Zanzibar is viewed as comparable to Hong Kong as suggested by some scholars, and with some recognizing the island as an \"African Hong Kong\".\nNowadays, The Alliance for Change and Transparency-Wazalendois (ACT-Wazalendo) is considered the main opposition political party of semi-autonomous Zanzibar. The constitution of Zanzibar requires the party that comes in second in the polls to join a coalition with the winning party. ACT-Wazalendo joined a coalition government with the islands' ruling party, Chama Cha Mapinduzi, in December 2020 after Zanzibar disputed elections.\nGeography.\nZanzibar is one of the Indian Ocean islands. It is situated on the Swahili Coast, adjacent to Tanganyika (mainland Tanzania).\nThe northern tip of Unguja island is located at 5.72 degrees south, 39.30 degrees east, with the southernmost point at 6.48 degrees south, 39.51 degrees east. The island is separated from the Tanzanian mainland by a channel, which at its narrowest point is across. The island is about long and wide, with an area of . Unguja is mainly low lying, with its highest point being . Unguja is characterised by beautiful sandy beaches with fringing coral reefs. The reefs are rich in marine biodiversity.\nThe northern tip of Pemba Island is located at 4.87 degrees south, 39.68 degrees east, and the southernmost point is located at 5.47 degrees south, 39.72 degrees east. The island is separated from the Tanzanian mainland by a channel some wide. The island is about long and wide, with an area of . Pemba is also mainly low lying, with its highest point being .\nClimate.\nZanzibar has a tropical monsoon climate (Am). The heat of summer (corresponding to the Northern Hemisphere winter) is often cooled by strong sea breezes associated with the northeast monsoon (known as \"Kaskazi\" in Kiswahili), particularly on the north and east coasts. Being near the equator, the islands are warm year-round. The rainfall regime is split into two main seasons, a primary maximum in March, April, and May in association with the southwest monsoon (known locally as \"Kusi\" in Kiswahili), and a secondary maximum in November and December. The months in between receive less rain, with a minimum in July.\nWildlife.\nUnguja.\nThe main island of Zanzibar, Unguja, has a fauna reflecting its connection to the African mainland during the last Ice Age.\nEndemic mammals with continental relatives include the Zanzibar red colobus (\"Procolobus kirkii\"), one of Africa's rarest primates, with perhaps only 1,500 existing. Isolated on this island for at least 1,000 years, this colobus is recognized as a distinct species, with different coat patterns, calls, and food habits from related colobus species on the mainland. The Zanzibar red colobus lives in a wide variety of drier areas of coastal thickets and coral rag scrub, as well as mangrove swamps and agricultural areas. About one third of them live in and around Jozani Forest. The easiest place to see the colobus is farmland adjacent to the reserve. They are accustomed to people, and the low vegetation means they come close to the ground.\nRare native animals include the Zanzibar leopard, which is critically endangered, and the recently described Zanzibar servaline genet. There are no large wild animals in Unguja. Forested areas such as Jozani are inhabited by monkeys, bushpigs, small antelopes, African palm civets, and, as shown by a camera trap in June 2018, the elusive leopard. Various species of mongoose can also be found on the island. There is a wide variety of birdlife and a large number of butterflies in rural areas.\nPemba.\nPemba Island is separated from Unguja Island and the African continent by deep channels and has a correspondingly restricted fauna, reflecting its comparative isolation from the mainland. The island is home to the Pemba flying fox.\nStandard of living and health.\nConsiderable disparities exist in the standard of living for inhabitants of Pemba and Unguja, as well as the disparity between urban and rural populations. The average annual income is US$2500. About half the population lives below the poverty line.\nDespite a relatively high standard of primary health care and education, infant mortality in Zanzibar is 54 out of 1,000 live births, which is 10.0 percent lower than the rate in mainland Tanzania. The child mortality rate in Zanzibar is 73 out of 1,000 live births, which is 21.5 percent lower than the rate in mainland Tanzania. The birth rate in Tanzania in 2021 is high, 35.64 births per 1000 population, but the rate is falling.\nIt is estimated that 7% of children in Zanzibar have acute malnutrition.\nLife expectancy at birth is 57 years, which is significantly lower than the 2010 world average of 67.2.\nThe general prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the population of Zanzibar aged 15\u201364 is 0.5 percent, with the rate much higher in females (0.9 percent) than males (less than 0.1 percent).\nEnvironment.\nThe northern part of the island contains significant volumes of trash in the streets, beaches, and ocean\u2014mostly plastic bottles, other plastics, and cigarette butts. There is indiscriminate dumping in residential areas. Medical equipment waste is a particular problem on the island.\nClimate change impact.\nStudies show temperatures and wind speeds have increased dramatically over the last 40 years. These climatic stressors, in addition to changes in rainfall patterns, have had significant impacts on seaweed algaculture, causing the crop to rot or be destroyed during the harvesting process.\nEconomy.\nHistory.\nAncient pottery implies trade routes with Zanzibar as far back as the time of the ancient Assyrians. Traders from the Arabian Peninsula, the Persian Gulf region of modern-day Iran (especially Shiraz), and west India probably visited Zanzibar as early as the 1st century. They used the monsoon winds to sail across the Indian Ocean to land at the sheltered harbor located on the site of present-day Zanzibar City.\nThe clove, originating from the Moluccan Islands (today in Indonesia), was introduced in Zanzibar by the Omani sultans in the first half of the 19th century. Zanzibar, mainly Pemba Island, was once the world's leading clove producer, but annual clove sales have plummeted by 80 percent since the 1970s. Zanzibar's clove industry has been crippled by a fast-moving global market, international competition, and a hangover from Tanzania's failed experiment with socialism in the 1960s and 1970s, when the government controlled clove prices and exports. Zanzibar now ranks a distant third, with Indonesia supplying 75 percent of the world's cloves compared to Zanzibar's 7 percent.\nIndustry and foreign investment.\nZanzibar exports spices, seaweed, and fine raffia. Research into the economic potential of seaweed farming was undertaken by Adelaida K. Semesi from 1982 until she died in 2001. Beside the Zanzibar State Trading Cooperation, Zanj Spice Limited, also known as 1001 Organic, is the biggest organic spice exporter in Zanzibar. Zanzibar also has a large fishing and dugout canoe production. Tourism is a major source of the country's foreign currency reserves.\nThe Government of Zanzibar legalized foreign exchange bureaux on the islands before mainland Tanzania moved to do so. The effect was to increase the availability of consumer commodities. The government has also established a free port area, which provides the following benefits: contribution to economic diversification by providing a window for free trade as well as stimulating the establishment of support services; administration of a regime that imports, exports, and warehouses general merchandise; adequate storage facilities and other infrastructure to cater for effective operation of trade; and creation of an efficient management system for effective re-exportation of goods.\nThe island's manufacturing sector is limited mainly to import substitution industries, such as cigarettes, shoes, and processed agricultural products. In 1992, the government designated two export-producing zones and encouraged the development of offshore financial services. Zanzibar still imports much of its staple requirements, petroleum products, and manufactured articles.\nThere is also a possibility of oil availability in Zanzibar on the island of Pemba, and efforts have been made by the Tanzanian government and the Zanzibar revolutionary government to exploit what could be one of the most significant discoveries in recent memory. Oil would help boost the economy of Zanzibar, but there have been disagreements about dividends between the Tanzanian mainland and Zanzibar, the latter claiming the oil should be excluded from Union matters.\nIn 2007, a Norwegian consultancy firm went to Zanzibar to determine how the region could develop its oil potential. The firm recommended that Zanzibar follow economist Hernando de Soto Polar's ideas about the formalization of property rights for persons living on ancestral land for which they probably do not have a legal deed.\nEnergy.\nThe energy sector in Zanzibar consists of unreliable electric power, petroleum, and petroleum products; it is also supplemented by firewood and its related products. Coal and gas are rarely used for either domestic or industrial purposes.\nUnguja (Zanzibar Island) gets most of its electric power from mainland Tanzania through a 39-kilometer, 100-megawatt submarine cable from Ras Kiromoni (near Dar es Salaam) to Ras Fumba on Unguja. The laying of the cable was begun on 10 October 2012 by the Viscas Corporation of Japan and was funded by a US$28.1 million grant from the United States through the Millennium Challenge Corporation. The cable became operational on 13 April 2013. The previous 45-megawatt cable, which was seldom-maintained, was completed by Norway in 1980.\nSince May 2010, Pemba Island has had a , 25-megawatt, subsea electrical link directly to mainland Tanzania. The cable project was financed through a 45 million euro grant from Norway and contributions of 8 million euros from the Zanzibar government and 4 million euros from the Tanzanian national government. The project ended years of dependence on unreliable and erratic diesel generation, subject to frequent power cuts. Only about 20 percent of the cable's capacity was being used in January 2011, so it is anticipated that the cable will meet the island's needs for 20 to 25 years.\nBetween 70 and 75 percent of the electricity generated is used domestically, while less than 20 percent is used industrially. Fuel wood, charcoal, and kerosene are widely used as sources of energy for cooking and lighting in most rural and urban areas. The consumption capacity of petroleum, gas, oil, kerosene, and industrial diesel oil is increasing annually, going from a total of 5,650 tons consumed in 1997 to more than 7,500 tons in 1999.\nFrom 21 May to 19 June 2008, Unguja suffered a major failure of its electricity system, which left the island without electrical service and mostly dependent on diesel generators. The failure originated in mainland Tanzania. Another blackout happened from 10 December 2009 to 23 March 2010, caused by a problem with the submarine cable that formerly supplied electricity from mainland Tanzania. This led to a serious shock to Unguja's fragile economy, which is heavily dependent on foreign tourism.\nTransport.\nRoads.\nZanzibar has of roads, of which 85 percent are sealed or partly-sealed tarmac. The remainder are gravel roads, which are rehabilitated annually to make them passable throughout the year. Zanzibar has a Road Fund Board, situated at Maisala, which collects funds and disburses them to the Ministry of Communication, which is the Road Agency at this time, through the Department of Road Maintenance, known as UUB.\nThe Road Fund Board oversees a Performance Agreement entered between the Ministry of Communication and Infrastructure, while procurement and maintenance are assumed by the latter.\nPublic transportation.\nThere is no government-owned public transportation in Zanzibar. The privately owned Daladala, as it is officially known in Zanzibar, is the only kind of public transportation. The term Daladala originated from the Kiswahili word DALA (Dollar) or five shillings during the 1970s and 1980s when public transport cost five shillings to travel to the nearest town. Therefore, travelling to town will cost a Dollar (\"Dala\") and returning will again cost a Dollar, hence the term Daladala originated.\nStone Town is the main hub for Daladalas on Zanzibar, and nearly all journeys will either start or end here. There are two main Dala Dala stations in Stone Town: Darajani market and Mwanakwerekwe market. The Darajani market terminus serves the North and North East of the island, and the Mwanakwerekwe market terminus serves the South and South East. As with most of East African transport, the buses do not run on set schedules \u2013 instead departing when full. As there is no fixed schedule, it is not possible to book tickets in advance (except for http://). There are plans to implement a government-operated bus service on the island, which will bring the ground transport more in line with the relatively developed water and air transport infrastructure. With Zanzibar visitor numbers set to exceed 1,000,000 annually, there will be increasing pressure on the current transportation network \u2013 the bus network will reduce the number of vehicles on the road and help reduce the environmental impact of tourism on Zanzibar.\nMaritime transport.\nPorts.\nThere are five ports in the islands of Unguja and Pemba, all operated and developed by the Zanzibar Ports Corporation.\nThe main port at Malindi, which handles 90 percent of Zanzibar's trade, was built in 1925. The port was rehabilitated between 1989 and 1992 with financial assistance from the European Union. The Italian contractor, Salini Impregilo S.p.A., was supposed to build wharves that lasted 60 years; however, the wharves lasted only 11 years before crumbling and degenerating because the company deviated from the specifications by using poor-quality material. After a long legal battle, the company was required in 2005 by the International Court of Arbitration to pay Zanzibar US$11.6 million in damages. The port was again rehabilitated between 2004 and 2009 with a 31 million euro grant from the European Union. The contract was awarded to M/S E. Phil and Sons of Denmark. The then-director of the contractor suggested that the rehabilitation would last a minimum of 50 years. But the port is again facing problems, including sinking. A new dedicated passenger port is planned to be constructed in Mpigaduri as a public\u2013private partnership.\nThe MV \"Faith\", which began its final journey at the port of Dar es Salaam, sank in May 2009 shortly before docking at the port of Malindi. Six of the 25 people aboard lost their lives.\nThe sinking of the MV Spice Islander I on 10 September 2011, after departing from Unguja island for Pemba Island, was the worst disaster in Tanzanian history. In a report to the Zanzibar House of Representatives on 14 October 2011, Zanzibar's Second Vice President, Ambassador Seif Ali Iddi, said that 2,764 people were missing, 203 bodies had been recovered, and 619 passengers were rescued. It was the worst maritime disaster in Tanzanian history. A presidential commission, however, reported three months later that 1,370 people were missing, 203 bodies had been recovered, and 941 passengers survived. Severe overloading caused the ferry to sink.\nThe MV \"Skagit\", which began its final journey at the port of Dar es Salaam, capsized in rough seas near Chumbe Island on 18 July 2012. The ferry had 447 passengers, with 81 dead, 212 missing and presumed drowned, and 154 rescued. The ferry left port despite warnings from the Tanzania Meteorological Agency for ships not to attempt the crossing from Dar es Salaam to Unguja island because of the rough seas. A presidential commission reported in October 2012 that overloading was the cause of the disaster.\nAirport.\nZanzibar's main airport, Abeid Amani Karume International Airport, has been able to handle large passenger planes since 2011, which has increased passenger and cargo inflows and outflows. Since another increase in capacity by the end of 2013, it can serve up to 1.5 million passengers per year. The island can be reached by flights operated by Air France, Auric Air, Air Tanzania, Coastal Aviation, Ethiopian Airlines, Kenya Airways, FlyDubai, Qatar Airways, Turkish Airlines and others.\nCulture.\nZanzibar's most famous event is the Zanzibar International Film Festival (ZIFF), also known as the Festival of the Dhow Countries. Every July, this event showcases the best of the Swahili Coast arts scene, including Zanzibar's favorite music, taarab. Zanzibar is the birthplace of the British singer-songwriter and band leader of Queen, Freddie Mercury.\nImportant architectural features in Stone Town are the Livingstone house, The Old dispensary of Zanzibar, the Guliani Bridge, Ngome kongwe (The Old fort of Zanzibar) and the House of Wonders. The town of Kidichi features the Hamamni Persian Baths, built by immigrants from Shiraz, Iran during the reign of Barghash bin Said.\nZanzibar is also the only place in Eastern African countries to have the long settlement houses formally known as Michenzani flats. The flats were built with aid from East Germany during the 1970s to solve housing problems in Zanzibar.\nMedia and communication.\nIn 1973, Zanzibar introduced the first colour television service in sub-Saharan Africa. Because of longstanding opposition to television by President Julius Nyerere, the first television service on mainland Tanzania was not introduced until 1994. The broadcaster in Zanzibar, called Television Zanzibar (TVZ), had recently changed its name to Zanzibar Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC). following an enactment of an act to make it a public corporation, monitored under the Ministry of Finance by the treasurer registrar. Among the famous reporters of TVZ during the 1980s and 1990s were the late Alwiya Alawi 1961\u20131996 (the elder sister of Inat Alawi, a famous Taarab singer during the 1980s), Neema Mussa, Sharifa Maulid, Fatma Mzee, Zaynab Ali, Ramadhan Ali, and Khamis.\nZanzibar has one AM radio station and 21 FM radio stations.\nIn terms of landline communications, Zanzibar is served by the Tanzania Telecommunications Company Limited and Zantel Tanzania.\nAlmost all mobile and Internet companies serving mainland Tanzania are also available in Zanzibar.\nEducation.\nIn 2000, there were 207 government schools and 118 privately owned schools in Zanzibar. Zanzibar has three fully accredited Universities: Zanzibar University, the State University of Zanzibar (SUZA) and Sumait University (previously University College of Education, Chukwani).\nSUZA was established in 1999, and is located in Stone Town, in the buildings of the former Institute of Kiswahili and Foreign Language (TAKILUKI). It is the only public institution for higher learning in Zanzibar, the other two institutions being private. In 2004, the three institutions had a total enrollment of 948 students, of whom 207 were female.\nThe primary and secondary education system in Zanzibar is slightly different from that of the Tanzanian mainland. On the mainland, education is only compulsory for the seven years of primary education, while in Zanzibar, an additional three years of secondary education are compulsory and free. Students in Zanzibar score significantly less on standardized tests for reading and mathematics than students on the mainland.\nIn the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, national service after secondary education was necessary, but it is now voluntary, and few students volunteer. Most choose to seek employment or attend teachers' colleges.\nThe IIT Madras set up a campus in Zanzibar, which began classes for the first batch in November 2023.\nSports.\nFootball is the most popular sport in Zanzibar, overseen by the Zanzibar Football Association. Zanzibar is an associate member of the Confederation of African Football (CAF), but not of FIFA. This means that the Zanzibar national football team is not eligible to enter national CAF competitions, such as the African Nations Cup, but Zanzibar's football clubs get representation at the CAF Confederation Cup and the CAF Champions League.\nThe national team participates in non-FIFA Football tournaments such as the FIFI Wild Cup, and the ELF Cup. Because Zanzibar is not a member of FIFA, their team is not eligible for the FIFA World Cup.\nThe Zanzibar Football Association also has a Premier League for the top clubs, which was created in 1981. The teams also participate in the FA knockout competition, Zanzibari Cup and the Mapinduzi Cup, a knockout competition organized in early January between 6\u201313 January to mark the revolution day (12 January).\nCricket was historically popular in Zanzibar. In the 1950s and 1960s, the island hosted touring teams from England, India, Pakistan, South Africa and Uganda, but the sport declined following the 1964 revolution. Zanzibar contributed some players to the East Africa cricket team in the late 20th century. Efforts to revive the game in the 21st century have been led by Indian firms, with plans announced in 2022 for an international-grade cricket ground in Fumba with the support of the Zanzibar government.\nSince 1992, there has also been judo in Zanzibar. The founder, Tsuyoshi Shimaoka, established a team that participates in national and international competitions. In 1999, Zanzibar Judo Association (Z.J.A.) was registered and became an active member of the Tanzania Olympic Committee and International Judo Federation.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}
{"id": "34415", "revid": "82432", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34415", "title": "Zambia", "text": "Country in South-Central Africa\nZambia, officially the Republic of Zambia, is a landlocked country located in Southeast Africa. It is bordered to the north by the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania to the north-east, Malawi to the east, Mozambique to the southeast, Zimbabwe and Botswana to the south, Namibia to the southwest, and Angola to the west. The capital city of Zambia is Lusaka, located in the south-central part of Zambia. The population is concentrated mainly around Lusaka in the south and the Copperbelt Province to the north, the core economic hubs of the country.\nOriginally inhabited by Khoisan peoples, the region was affected by the Bantu expansion of the thirteenth century. Following European expeditions in the eighteenth century, Britain colonised the region, forming the British protectorates of Barotziland\u2013North-Western Rhodesia and North-Eastern Rhodesia towards the end of the nineteenth century. These were merged in 1911 to form Northern Rhodesia. For most of the colonial period, Zambia was governed by an administration appointed from London with the advice of the British South Africa Company.\nOn 24 October 1964, Zambia became independent of the United Kingdom as a republic in the Commonwealth, and prime minister Kenneth Kaunda became the inaugural president. Kaunda's socialist United National Independence Party (UNIP) maintained power from 1964 until 1991 with him playing a key role in regional diplomacy, cooperating closely with the United States in search of solutions to conflicts in Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe), Angola, and Namibia. From 1972 to 1991, Zambia was a one-party state with UNIP as the sole legal political party under the motto \"One Zambia, One Nation\" coined by Kaunda. Kaunda was succeeded by Frederick Chiluba of the social-democratic Movement for Multi-Party Democracy in 1991, beginning a period of socio-economic development and government decentralisation. Zambia has since become a multi-party state and has experienced several peaceful transitions of power.\nZambia contains abundant natural resources, including minerals, wildlife, forestry, freshwater, and arable land. As of the latest estimate in 2018, 47.9 percent of the population is affected by multidimensional poverty. The Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) is headquartered in Lusaka.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEtymology.\nThe territory of Zambia was known as Northern Rhodesia from 1911 to 1964. It was renamed Zambia in October 1964 on its independence from British rule. The name Zambia derives from the Zambezi River (Zambezi may mean \"the grand river\").\nHistory.\nPrehistoric era.\nArchaeological excavation work on the Zambezi Valley and Kalambo Falls shows a succession of human cultures. Ancient camp site tools near the Kalambo Falls have been radiocarbon dated to more than 36,000 years ago.\nThe fossil skull remains of the Broken Hill Man (also known as Kabwe Man), dated between 300,000 and 125,000 years BC, further shows that the area was inhabited by early humans. Broken Hill Man was discovered in Zambia in Kabwe District.\nKhoisan and Batwa.\nModern Zambia once was inhabited by the Khoisan and Batwa peoples until around AD 300, when migrating Bantu began to settle the areas. It is believed the Khoisan people originated in East Africa and spread southwards around 150,000 years ago. The Twa people were split into two groups: the Kafwe Twa lived around the Kafue Flats and the Lukanga Twa who lived around the Lukanga Swamp. Many examples of ancient rock art in Zambia, like the Mwela Rock Paintings, Mumbwa Caves, and Nachikufu Cave, are attributed to these early hunter-gatherers. The Khoisan and especially the Twa formed a patron-client relationship with farming Bantu peoples across central and southern Africa but were eventually either displaced by or absorbed into the Bantu groups.\nThe Bantu (Abantu).\nThe Bantu people or Abantu (meaning people) are an enormous and diverse ethnolinguistic group that comprise the majority of people in much of eastern, southern and central Africa. Due to Zambia's location at the crossroads of Central Africa, Southern Africa, and the African Great Lakes, the history of the people that constitute modern Zambians is a history of these three regions.\nMany of the historical events in these three regions happened simultaneously. Thus, Zambia's history, like that of many African nations, cannot be presented perfectly chronologically. The early history of the peoples of modern Zambia is deduced from oral records, archaeology, and written records, mostly from non-Africans.\nBantu origins.\nThe Bantu people originally lived in West and Central Africa around what is today Cameroon and Nigeria. Approximately 5000 years ago, they began a millennia-long expansion into much of the continent. This event has been called the Bantu expansion; it was one of the largest human migrations in history. The Bantu are believed to have been the first to have brought iron working technology into large parts of Africa. The Bantu Expansion happened primarily through two routes: a western one via the Congo Basin and an eastern one via the African Great Lakes.\nFirst Bantu settlement.\nThe first Bantu people to arrive in Zambia came through the eastern route via the African Great Lakes. They arrived around the first millennium C.E, and among them were the Tonga, Ila and Namwanga people and other related groups, who settled around Southern Zambia near Zimbabwe. The Tonga oral records indicate that they came from the east near the \"big sea\".\nThey were later joined by the Tumbuka people who settled around Eastern Zambia and Malawi.\nThese first Bantu people lived in large villages. They lacked an organised unit under a chief or headman and worked as a community and helped each other in times of field preparation for their crops. Villages moved around frequently as the soil became exhausted as a result of the slash-and-burn technique of planting crops. The people also kept large herds of cattle, which formed an important part of their societies.\nThe first Bantu communities in Zambia were highly self-sufficient. Early European missionaries who settled in Southern Zambia noted the independence of these Bantu societies. One of these missionaries noted:\n\"[If] weapons for war, hunting, and domestic purposes are needed, the [Tonga] man goes to the hills and digs until he finds the iron ore. He smelts it and with the iron thus obtained makes axes, hoes, and other useful implements. He burns wood and makes charcoal for his forge. His bellows are made from the skins of animals and the pipes are clay tile, and the anvil and hammers are also pieces of the iron he has obtained. He moulds, welds, shapes, and performs all the work of the ordinary blacksmith\".\nThese early Bantu settlers also participated in the trade at the site Ingombe Ilede (which translates to sleeping cow in Tonga because the fallen baobab tree appears to resemble a cow) in Southern Zambia. At this trading site, they met numerous Kalanga/Shona traders from Great Zimbabwe and Swahili traders from the East African Swahili coast. Ingombe Ilede was one of the most important trading posts for rulers of Great Zimbabwe, others being the Swahili port cities such as Sofala.\nThe goods traded at Ingombe Ilede included fabrics, beads, gold, and bangles. Some of these items came from what is today southern Democratic Republic of Congo and Kilwa Kisiwani while others came from as far away as India, China and the Arab world. The African traders were later joined by the Portuguese in the 16th century.\nThe decline of Great Zimbabwe, due to increasing trade competition from other Kalanga/Shona kingdoms like Khami and Mutapa, spelt the end of Ingombe Ilede.\nSecond Bantu settlement.\nThe second mass settlement of Bantu people into Zambia was of people groups that are believed to have taken the western route of the Bantu migration through the Congo Basin. These Bantu people spent the majority of their existence in what is today the Democratic Republic of Congo and are ancestors of the majority of modern Zambians.\nWhile there is some evidence that the Bemba people might have an ancient connection to the Kongo Kingdom through Kongo people ruler, Mwene Kongo VIII Mvemba, this is not well documented.\nLuba-Lunda states.\nThe Bemba, along with other related groups such as the Lamba, Bisa, Senga, Kaonde, Swaka, Nkoya and Soli, formed integral parts of the Luba Kingdom in Upemba part of the Democratic Republic of Congo and have a strong relation to the Luba people. The area which the Luba Kingdom occupied has been inhabited by early farmers and iron workers since the 300s C.E.\nOver time, these communities learned to use nets and harpoons, make dugout canoes, clear canals through swamps and make dams as high as . As a result, they grew a diverse economy trading fish, copper and iron items and salt for goods from other parts of Africa, like the Swahili coast and, later on, the Portuguese. From these communities arose the Luba Kingdom in the 14th century.\nThe Luba Kingdom was a large kingdom with a centralised government and smaller independent chiefdoms. It had large trading networks that linked the forests in the Congo Basin and the mineral-rich plateaus of what is today Copperbelt Province and stretched from the Atlantic coast to the Indian Ocean coast. The arts were also held in high esteem in the kingdom, and artisans were held in high regard.\nLiterature was well developed in the Luba Kingdom. One renowned Luba genesis story that articulated the distinction between two types of Luba emperors goes as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Nkongolo Mwamba, the red king, and Ilunga Mbidi Kiluwe, a prince of legendary black complexion. Nkongolo Mwamba is the drunken and cruel despot, Ilunga Mbidi Kiluwe the refined and gentle prince. Nkongolo the Red is a man without manners, a man who eats in public, gets drunk, and cannot control himself, whereas [Ilunga] Mbidi Kiluwe is a man of reservation, obsessed with good manners; he does not eat in public, controls his language and his behaviour, and keeps a distance from the vices and modus vivendi of ordinary people. Nkongolo Mwamba symbolises the embodiment of tyranny, whereas Mbidi Kiluwe remains the admired caring and compassionate kin.\nIn the same region of Southern Congo, the Lunda people were made into a satellite of the Luba empire and adopted forms of Luba culture and governance, thus becoming the Lunda Empire to the south. According to Lunda genesis myths, a Luba hunter named Chibinda Ilunga, son of Ilunga Mbidi Kiluwe, introduced the Luba model of statecraft to the Lunda sometime around 1600 when he married a local Lunda princess named Lueji and was granted control of her kingdom. Most rulers who claimed descent from Luba ancestors were integrated into the Luba empire. The Lunda kings, however, remained separate and actively expanded their political and economic dominance over the region.\nThe Lunda, like its parent state Luba, also traded with both coasts, the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. While ruler Mwaant Yaav Naweej had established trade routes to the Atlantic coast and initiated direct contact with European traders eager for slaves and forest products and controlling the regional Copper trade, and settlements around Lake Mweru regulated commerce with the East African coast.\nThe Luba-Lunda states eventually declined as a result of both Atlantic slave trade in the west and Indian Ocean slave trade in the east and wars with breakaway factions of the kingdoms. The Chokwe, a group that is closely related to the Luvale and formed a Lunda satellite state, initially suffered from the European demand for slaves, but once they broke away from the Lunda state, they themselves became notorious slave traders, exporting slaves to both coasts.\nThe Chokwe eventually were defeated by the other ethnic groups and the Portuguese. This instability caused the collapse of the Luba-Lunda states and a dispersal of people into various parts of Zambia from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The majority of Zambians trace their ancestry to the Luba-Lunda and surrounding Central African states.\nThe Maravi Confederacy.\nIn the 1200s, before the founding of the Luba-Lunda states, a group of Bantu people started migrating from the Congo Basin to Lake Mweru then finally settled around Lake Malawi. These migrants are believed to have been one of the inhabitants around the Upemba area in the Democratic Republic of Congo. By the 1400s these groups of migrants collectively called the Maravi, and most prominently among them was the Chewa people who started imitating other Bantu groups like the Tumbuka.\nIn 1480 the Maravi Empire was founded by the kalonga (paramount chief of the Maravi) from the Phiri clan, one of the main clans, with the others being Banda, Mwale and Nkhoma. The Maravi Empire stretched from the Indian Ocean through what today is Mozambique to Zambia and central parts of Malawi. The political organisation of the Maravi resembled that of the Luba and is believed to have originated from there. The primary export of the Maravi was ivory, which was transported to Swahili brokers.\nIron was also manufactured and exported. In the 1590s the Portuguese endeavoured to take monopoly over Maravi export trade. This attempt was met with outrage by the Maravi of Lundu, who unleashed their WaZimba armed force. The WaZimba sacked the Portuguese trade towns of Tete, Sena and various other towns.\nThe Maravi are also believed to have brought the traditions that would become Nyau secret society from Upemba. The Nyau form the cosmology or indigenous religion of the people of Maravi. The Nyau society consists of ritual dance performances and masks used for the dances; this belief system spread around the region.\nThe Maravi declined as a result of succession disputes within the confederacy, attack by the Ngoni and slave raids from the Yao.\nMutapa Empire and Mfecane.\nAs Great Zimbabwe was in decline, one of its princes, Nyatsimba Mutota, broke away from the state forming a new empire called Mutapa. The title of Mwene Mutapa, meaning \"Ravager of the Lands\", was bestowed on him and subsequent rulers.\nThe Mutapa Empire ruled territory between the Zambezi and Limpopo rivers, in what is now Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique, from the 14th to the 17th century. By its peak, Mutapa had conquered the Dande area of the Tonga and Tavara. The Mutapa Empire predominately engaged in the Indian Ocean transcontinental trade with and via the WaSwahili. The primary exported gold and ivory for silk and ceramics from Asia.\nLike their contemporaries in Maravi, Mutapa had problems with the arriving Portuguese traders. The peak of this uneasy relationship was reached when the Portuguese attempted to influence the kingdoms internal affairs by establishing markets in the kingdom and converting the population to Christianity. This action caused outrage by the Muslim WaSwahili living in the capital, this chaos gave the Portuguese the excuse they were searching for to warrant an attack on the kingdom and try to control its gold mines and ivory routes. This attack failed when the Portuguese succumbed to disease along the Zambezi river.\nIn the 1600s internal disputes and civil war began the decline of Mutapa. The weakened kingdom was finally conquered by the Portuguese and was eventually taken over by rival Shona states.\nThe Portuguese also had vast estates, known as Prazos, and they used slaves and ex-slaves as security guards and hunters. They trained the men in military tactics and gave them guns. These men became expert elephant hunters and were known as the Chikunda. After the decline of the Portuguese the Chikunda made their way to Zambia. \nIt is hypothesised by Julian Cobbing that the presence of early Europeans slave trading and attempts to control resources in various parts of Bantu-speaking Africa caused the gradual militarisation of the people in the region. This can be observed with the Maravi's WaZimba warrior caste, who, once defeating the Portuguese, remained quite militaristic afterwards.\nThe Portuguese presence in the region was also a major reason for the founding of the Rozvi Empire, a breakaway state of Mutapa. The ruler of the Rozvi, Changamire Dombo, became one of the most powerful leaders in South-Central Africa's history. Under his leadership, the Rozvi defeated the Portuguese and expelled them from their trading posts along the Zambezi river.\nBut perhaps the most notable instance of this increased militarisation was the rise of the Zulu under the leadership of Shaka. Pressures from the English colonialists in the Cape and increased militarisation of the Zulu resulted in the Mfecane (the crushing). The Zulu expanded by assimilating the women and children of tribes they defeated, if the men of these Nguni tribes escaped slaughter, they used the military tactics of the Zulu to attack other groups.\nThis caused mass displacements, wars and raids throughout Southern, Central and Eastern Africa as Nguni or Ngoni tribes made their way throughout the region and is referred to as the Mfecane. The arriving Nguni under the leadership of Zwagendaba crossed the Zambezi river moving northwards. The Ngoni were the final blow to the already weakened Maravi Empire. Many Nguni eventually settled around what is today Zambia, Malawi, Mozambique and Tanzania and assimilated into neighbouring tribes.\nIn the western part of Zambia, another Southern African group of Sotho-Tswana heritage called the Kololo manage to conquer the local inhabitants who were migrants from the fallen Luba and Lunda states called the Luyana or Aluyi. The Luyana established the Barotse Kingdom on the floodplains of the Zambezi upon their arrival from Katanga. Under the Kololo, the Kololo language was imposed upon the Luyana until the Luyana revolted and overthrew the Kololo by this time the Luyana language was largely forgotten and a new hybrid language emerged, SiLozi and the Luyana began to refer to themselves as Lozi.\nAt the end of the 18th century, some of the Mbunda migrated to Barotseland, Mongu upon the migration of among others, the Ciyengele. The Aluyi and their leader, the Litunga Mulambwa, especially valued the Mbunda for their fighting ability.\nBy the late 18th century, most of the various peoples of Zambia were established in their current areas.\nColonial period.\nEuropeans.\nOne of the earliest recorded Europeans to visit the area was the Portuguese explorer Francisco de Lacerda in the late 18th century. Lacerda led an expedition from Mozambique to the Kazembe region in Zambia (with the goal of exploring and to crossing Southern Africa from coast to coast for the first time), and died during the expedition in 1798. The expedition was from then on led by his friend Francisco Pinto. This territory, located between Portuguese Mozambique and Portuguese Angola, was claimed and explored by Portugal in that period.\nOther European visitors followed in the 19th century. The most prominent of these was David Livingstone, who had a vision of ending the slave trade through the \"3 Cs\": Christianity, Commerce, and Civilisation. He was the first European to see the magnificent waterfalls on the Zambezi River in 1855, naming them the Victoria Falls after Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. He described them thus: \"Scenes so lovely must have been gazed upon by angels in their flight\".\nLocally the falls are known as \"Mosi-o-Tunya\" or \"thundering smoke\" in the Lozi or Kololo dialect. The town of Livingstone, near the Falls, is named after him. Highly publicised accounts of his journeys motivated a wave of European visitors, missionaries and traders after his death in 1873.\nBritish South Africa Company\nIn 1888, the British South Africa Company (BSA Company), led by Cecil Rhodes, obtained mineral rights from the Litunga of the Lozi people, the Paramount Chief of the Lozi (Ba-rotse) for the area which later became Barotziland-North-Western Rhodesia.\nTo the east, in December 1897 a group of the Angoni or Ngoni (originally from Zululand) rebelled under Tsinco, son of King Mpezeni, but the rebellion was put down, and Mpezeni accepted the Pax Britannica. That part of the country then came to be known as North-Eastern Rhodesia. In 1895, Rhodes asked his American scout Frederick Russell Burnham to look for minerals and ways to improve river navigation in the region, and it was during this trek that Burnham discovered major copper deposits along the Kafue River.\nNorth-Eastern Rhodesia and Barotziland-North-Western Rhodesia were administered as separate units until 1911 when they were merged to form Northern Rhodesia, a British protectorate. In 1923, the BSA Company ceded control of Northern Rhodesia to the British Government after the government decided not to renew the company's charter.\nBritish colonisation.\nIn 1923, Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), a conquered territory which was also administered by the BSA Company, became a self-governing British colony. In 1924, after negotiations, the administration of Northern Rhodesia transferred to the British Colonial Office.\nIn 1953, the creation of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland grouped together Northern Rhodesia, Southern Rhodesia, and Nyasaland (now Malawi) as a single semi-autonomous region. This was undertaken despite opposition from a sizeable minority of the population, who demonstrated against it in 1960\u201361. Northern Rhodesia was the centre of much of the turmoil and crisis characterising the federation in its last years. Initially, Harry Nkumbula's African National Congress (ANC) led the campaign, which Kenneth Kaunda's United National Independence Party (UNIP) subsequently took up.\nIndependence.\nA two-stage election held in October and December 1962 resulted in an African majority in the legislative council and an uneasy coalition between the two African nationalist parties. The council passed resolutions calling for Northern Rhodesia's secession from the federation and demanding full internal self-government under a new constitution and a new National Assembly based on a broader, more democratic franchise.\nThe federation was dissolved on 31 December 1963, and in January 1964, Kaunda won the only election for Prime Minister of Northern Rhodesia. The Colonial Governor, Sir Evelyn Hone, was very close to Kaunda and urged him to stand for the post. Soon after, there was an uprising in the north of the country known as the Lumpa Uprising led by Alice Lenshina\u00a0\u2013 Kaunda's first internal conflict as leader of the nation.\nNorthern Rhodesia became the Republic of Zambia on 24 October 1964, with Kenneth Kaunda as the first president. At independence, despite its considerable mineral wealth, Zambia faced major challenges. Domestically, there were few trained and educated Zambians capable of running the government, and the economy was largely dependent on foreign expertise. This expertise was provided in part by British diplomat John Willson. There were over 70,000 Europeans resident in Zambia in 1964, and they remained of disproportionate economic significance.\nPost Independence.\nKaunda's endorsement of Patriotic Front guerrillas conducting raids into neighbouring (Southern) Rhodesia resulted in political tension and a militarisation of the border, leading to its closure in 1973. The Kariba hydroelectric station on the Zambezi River provided sufficient capacity to satisfy the country's requirements for electricity, despite Rhodesian management.\nOn 3 September 1978, civilian airliner, Air Rhodesia Flight 825, was shot down near Kariba by the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA). 18 people, including children, survived the crash only for most of them to be shot by militants of the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) led by Joshua Nkomo. Rhodesia responded with Operation Gatling, an attack on Nkomo's guerilla bases in Zambia, in particular, his military headquarters just outside Lusaka; this raid became known as the Green Leader Raid. On the same day, two more bases in Zambia were attacked using air power and elite paratroops and helicopter-borne troops.\nA railway (TAZARA \u2013 Tanzania Zambia Railways) to the Tanzanian port of Dar es Salaam, completed in 1975 with Chinese assistance, reduced Zambian dependence on railway lines south to South Africa and west through an increasingly troubled Portuguese Angola. Until the completion of the railway, Zambia's major artery for imports and the critical export of copper was along the TanZam Road, running from Zambia to the port cities in Tanzania. The Tazama oil pipeline was also built from Dar es Salaam to Ndola in Zambia.\nBy the late 1970s, Mozambique and Angola had attained independence from Portugal. Rhodesia's predominantly white government, which issued a Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965, accepted majority rule under the Lancaster House Agreement in 1979.\nCivil strife in both Portuguese colonies and a mounting Namibian War of Independence resulted in an influx of refugees and compounded transportation issues. The Benguela railway, which extended west through Angola, was essentially closed to Zambian traffic by the late 1970s. Zambia's support for anti-apartheid movements such as the African National Congress (ANC) also created security problems as the South African Defence Force struck at dissident targets during external raids.\nIn 1989, two of Zambia's natural sites, Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park and Victoria Falls were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.\nEconomic troubles.\nIn the mid-1970s, the price of copper, Zambia's principal export, suffered a severe decline worldwide. In Zambia's situation, the cost of transporting the copper great distances to the market was an additional strain. Zambia turned to foreign and international lenders for relief, but, as copper prices remained depressed, it became increasingly difficult to service its growing debt. By the mid-1990s, despite limited debt relief, Zambia's per capita foreign debt remained among the highest in the world.\nDemocratisation.\nIn June 1990, riots against Kaunda accelerated and many protesters were killed by the regime. In 1990, Kaunda survived an attempted coup, and in 1991, he agreed to reinstate multiparty democracy, having instituted one-party rule under the Choma Commission of 1972. Following multiparty elections, Kaunda was removed from office.\nIn the 2000s, the economy stabilised, attaining single-digit inflation in 2006\u20132007, real GDP growth, decreasing interest rates, and increasing levels of trade. Much of its growth is due to foreign investment in mining and to higher world copper prices. All this led to Zambia being courted enthusiastically by aid donors and saw a surge in investor confidence in the country.\nPolitics.\nPolitics in Zambia takes place in a framework of a presidential representative democratic republic, whereby the president of Zambia is both head of state and head of government in a pluriform multi-party system. The government exercises executive power, while legislative power is vested in both the government and parliament.\nZambia became a republic immediately upon attaining independence in October 1964. From 2011 to 2014, Zambia's president had been Michael Sata, until Sata died on 28 October 2014. After Sata's death, Vice President Guy Scott, a Zambian of Scottish descent, became acting president. Presidential elections were held on 22 January 2015. A total number of 11 presidential candidates contested in the election and On 24 January 2015, it was announced that Edgar Chagwa Lungu had won the election to become the 6th President in a tightly contested race. He won 48.33% of the vote, a lead of 1.66% over his closest rival, Hakainde Hichilema, with 46.67%. Nine other candidates all got less than 1% each. In August 2016 Zambian general election president Edgar Lungu won re-election narrowly in the first round of the election. The opposition had allegations of fraud and the governing Patriotic Front (PF) rejected the allegations made by opposition UPND party.\nIn the 2021 general elections, characterised by a 70% voter turnout, Hakainde Hichilema won 59% of the vote, with his closest rival, incumbent president Edgar Chagwa Lungu, receiving 39% of the vote. On 16 August Edgar Lungu conceded in a TV statement, sending a letter and congratulating president-elect Hakainde Hichilema. On 24 August 2021, Hakainde Hichilema was sworn in as the new president of Zambia.\nForeign relations.\nAfter independence in 1964, the foreign relations of Zambia were mostly focused on supporting liberation movements in other countries in Southern Africa, such as the African National Congress and SWAPO. During the Cold War, Zambia was a member of the Non-Aligned Movement.\nMilitary.\nThe Zambian Defence Force (ZDF) consists of the Zambia Army (ZA), the Zambia Air Force (ZAF), and the Zambian National Service (ZNS). The ZDF is designed primarily against external threats.\nIn 2019, Zambia signed the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.\nAdministrative divisions.\nZambia is administratively divided into ten provinces subdivided into 117 districts, and electorally into 156 constituencies and 1,281 wards.\nHuman rights.\nThe government is sensitive to any opposition and criticism and has been quick to prosecute critics using the legal pretext that they had incited public disorder. Libel laws are used to suppress free speech and the press.\nSame-sex sexual activity is illegal for both males and females in Zambia. A 2010 survey revealed that only 2% of Zambians find homosexuality to be morally acceptable.\nIn December 2019, it was reported that United States Ambassador to Zambia Daniel Lewis Foote was \"horrified\" by Zambia's jailing of same-sex couple Japhet Chataba and Steven Samba. After an appeal failed and the couple was sentenced to 15 years in prison, Foote asked the Zambian government to review both the case and the country's anti-homosexuality laws. Foote faced a backlash and cancelled public appearances after he was threatened on social media, and was subsequently recalled after Lungu declared him \"persona non grata\".\nGeography.\nZambia is a landlocked country in southern Africa, with a tropical climate, and consists mostly of high plateaus with some hills and mountains, dissected by river valleys. At it is the 39th-largest country in the world, slightly smaller than Chile. The country lies mostly between latitudes 8\u00b0 and 18\u00b0S, and longitudes 22\u00b0 and 34\u00b0E.\nZambia is drained by two major river basins: the Zambezi/Kafue basin in the centre, west, and south covering about three-quarters of the country; and the Congo basin in the north covering about one-quarter of the country. A very small area in the northeast forms part of the internal drainage basin of Lake Rukwa in Tanzania.\nIn the Zambezi basin, there are a number of major rivers flowing wholly or partially through Zambia: the Kabompo, Lungwebungu, Kafue, Luangwa, and the Zambezi itself, which flows through the country in the west and then forms its southern border with Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe. Its source is in Zambia but it diverts into Angola, and a number of its tributaries rise in Angola's central highlands. The edge of the Cuando River floodplain (not its main channel) forms Zambia's southwestern border, and via the Chobe River that river contributes very little water to the Zambezi because most are lost by evaporation.\nTwo of the Zambezi's longest and largest tributaries, the Kafue and the Luangwa, flow mainly in Zambia. Their confluences with the Zambezi are on the border with Zimbabwe at Chirundu and Luangwa town respectively. Before its confluence, the Luangwa River forms part of Zambia's border with Mozambique. From Luangwa town, the Zambezi leaves Zambia and flows into Mozambique, and eventually into the Mozambique Channel.\nThe Zambezi falls about over the Victoria Falls, located in the southwest corner of the country, subsequently flowing into Lake Kariba. The Zambezi valley, running along the southern border, is both deep and wide. From Lake Kariba going east, it is formed by grabens and like the Luangwa, Mweru-Luapula, Mweru-wa-Ntipa and Lake Tanganyika valleys, is a rift valley.\nThe north of Zambia is very flat with broad plains. In the west the most notable being the Barotse Floodplain on the Zambezi, which floods from December to June, lagging behind the annual rainy season (typically November to April). The flood dominates the natural environment and the lives, society, and culture of the inhabitants and those of other smaller, floodplains throughout the country.\nIn Eastern Zambia the plateau which extends between the Zambezi and Lake Tanganyika valleys is tilted upwards to the north, and so rises imperceptibly from about in the south to in the centre, reaching in the north near Mbala. These plateau areas of northern Zambia have been categorised by the World Wildlife Fund as a large section of the Central Zambezian miombo woodlands ecoregion.\nEastern Zambia shows great diversity. The Luangwa Valley splits the plateau in a curve north-east to south-west, extended west into the heart of the plateau by the deep valley of the Lunsemfwa River. Hills and mountains are found by the side of some sections of the valley, notably in its north-east the Nyika Plateau () on the Malawi border, which extend into Zambia as the Mafinga Hills, containing the country's highest point, Mafinga Central ().\nThe Muchinga Mountains, the watershed between the Zambezi and Congo drainage basins, run parallel to the deep valley of the Luangwa River and form a sharp backdrop to its northern edge, although they are almost everywhere below . Their culminating peak Mumpu is at the western end and at is the highest point in Zambia away from the eastern border region. The border of the Congo Pedicle was drawn around this mountain.\nThe southernmost headstream of the Congo River rises in Zambia and flows west through its northern area firstly as the Chambeshi and then, after the Bangweulu Swamps as the Luapula, which forms part of the border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Luapula flows south then west before it turns north until it enters Lake Mweru. The lake's other major tributary is the Kalungwishi River, which flows into it from the east. The Luvua River drains Lake Mweru, flowing out of the northern end to the Lualaba River (Upper Congo River).\nLake Tanganyika is the other major hydrographic feature that belongs to the Congo basin. Its south-eastern end receives water from the Kalambo River, which forms part of Zambia's border with Tanzania. This river has Africa's second highest uninterrupted waterfall, the Kalambo Falls.\nClimate.\nZambia is located on the plateau of Central Africa, between above sea level. The average elevation of gives the land a generally moderate climate. The climate of Zambia is tropical, modified by elevation. In the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, most of the country is classified as \"humid subtropical\" (Cfa) or \"tropical wet and dry\" (Aw), with small stretches of semi-arid \"steppe climate\" (BSh) in the south-west and along the Zambezi valley.\nThe two main seasons are the rainy season (November to April) corresponding to summer, and the dry season (May/June to October/November), corresponding to winter. The dry season is subdivided into the cool dry season (May/June to August), and the hot dry season (September to October/November). The modifying influence of altitude gives the country pleasant subtropical weather rather than tropical conditions during the cool season of May to August. However, average monthly temperatures remain above over most of the country for eight or more months of the year.\nBiodiversity.\nThere are numerous ecosystems in Zambia, such as forest, thicket, woodland and grassland vegetation types.\nIn 2015, Zambia was reported to have approximately 12,505 identified species: 63% animal species, 33% plant species and 4% bacterial species and other microorganisms.\nThere are an estimated 3,543 species of wild flowering plants, consisting of sedges, herbaceous plants and woody plants. The Northern and North-Western provinces of the country especially have the highest diversity of flowering plants. Approximately 53% of flowering plants are rare and occur throughout the country.\nA total of 242 mammal species are found in the country, with most occupying the woodland and grassland ecosystems. The Rhodesian giraffe and Kafue lechwe are some of the well-known subspecies that are endemic to Zambia.\nAn estimated 757 bird species have been seen in the country, of which 600 are either resident or Afrotropic migrants; 470 breed in the country; and 100 are non-breeding migrants. The Zambian barbet is a species endemic to Zambia.\nRoughly 490 known fish species, belonging to 24 fish families, have been reported in Zambia, with Lake Tanganyika having the highest number of endemic species.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs of the 2022 Zambian census, Zambia's population was 19,610,769. During its colonial administration by the British between 1911 and 1963, the country attracted immigrants from Europe and the Indian subcontinent, the latter of whom came as indentured workers. While most Europeans left after the collapse of white-minority rule, many Asians remained. Zambia is home to a growing Asian community, with a majority being of Indian and Chinese descent.\nIn the first census\u2014conducted on 7 May 1911\u2014there were a total of 1,497 Europeans; 39 Asiatics and an estimated 820,000 black Africans. Black Africans were not counted in the six censuses conducted in 1911, 1921, 1931, 1946, 1951 and 1956, prior to independence, but their population was estimated. By 1956, there were 65,277 Europeans, 5,450 Asiatics, 5,450 coloureds and an estimated 2,100,000 black Africans.\nThe main ethnic groups in Zambia are Bemba 3.3 million (33.6%), Nyanja 1.8 million (18.2%), Tonga 1.7 million (16.8%), North-Western peoples 1 million (10.3%), Lozi (Barotse) 770,000 (7.8%), Mambwe 580,000 (5.9%), Tumbuka 500,000 (5.1%), Lamba 165,000 (2%), Asians 11,900 and Europeans 6,200.\nIn the 2010 population census, 99.2% were black Africans and 0.8% consisted of other racial groups.\n&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chart/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;\nZambia is one of the most highly urbanised countries in sub-Saharan Africa, with 44% of the population concentrated along the major transport corridors, while rural areas are sparsely populated. The fertility rate was 6.2 as of 2007[ [update]] (6.1 in 1996, 5.9 in 2001\u201302).\nLargest towns.\nThe onset of industrial copper mining on the Copperbelt in the late 1920s triggered rapid urbanisation. Although urbanisation was overestimated during the colonial period, it was substantial. Mining townships on the Copperbelt soon dwarfed existing centres of population and continued to grow rapidly following Zambian independence. Economic decline in the Copperbelt from the 1970s to the 1990s has altered patterns of urban development, but the country's population remains concentrated around the railway and roads running south from the Copperbelt through Kapiri Mposhi, Lusaka, Choma and Livingstone.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Largest_cities/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEthnic groups.\nZambia nominally includes approximately 73 ethnic groups, although in practice there are fewer distinct groups. Most Zambians are Bantu-speaking. The three largest ethnolinguistic groups are the Bemba, Nyanja (also called the Chewa), and Tonga; four smaller groups are the Kaonde, Lozi, Luanda, and Luvale. In 2010, the population was estimated to be 21% Bemba, 13.6% Tonga, 7.4% Chewa, 5.7% Lozi, 5.3% Nsenga, 4.4% Tumbuka, 4.0% Ngoni, and 38.6% other. The Bemba group is predominant in the Northern, Luapula, and Copperbelt provinces; the Nyanja in the Eastern and Central provinces; the Tonga in the Southern and Western provinces; and the Lozi in the Western Province. The Tumbuka minority lives in the Luangwa River valley in the east. No single ethnolinguistic group is predominant in the North-Western Province, which is sparsely populated.\nIn addition to the linguistic dimension, tribal identities are relevant in Zambia. These tribal identities are often linked to family allegiance or to traditional authorities. The tribal identities are nested within the main language groups.\nImmigrants, mostly British or South African, as well as some white Zambian citizens of British descent, live mainly in Lusaka and in the Copperbelt in northern Zambia, where they are either employed in mines, financial and related activities or retired. There were 70,000 Europeans in Zambia in 1964, but many since left the country.\nZambia has a small but economically important Asian population, most of whom are Indians and Chinese. This minority group has a massive impact on the economy controlling the manufacturing sector. An estimated 80,000 Chinese were reported to reside in Zambia in 2006. In recent years, several hundred dispossessed white farmers have left Zimbabwe at the invitation of the Zambian government, to take up farming in the Southern province.\nZambia has a minority of people of colour of mixed race, also known as coloureds. Coloureds in Zambia no longer appear on the census. During colonialism, segregation separated people of colour, blacks and whites in public places including schools, hospitals, and in housing. There has been an increase in interracial relationships due to Zambia's growing economy importing labor. People of colour are not recorded on the census but are considered a minority in Zambia.\nAccording to the \"World Refugee Survey 2009\" published by the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, Zambia had a population of refugees and asylum seekers numbering approximately 88,900. The majority of refugees in the country came from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (47,300 refugees from the DRC living in Zambia in 2007), Angola (27,100; see Angolans in Zambia), Zimbabwe (5,400) and Rwanda (4,900). Zambians are generally welcoming towards foreigners.\nBeginning in May 2008, the number of Zimbabweans in Zambia began to increase significantly; the influx consisted largely of Zimbabweans formerly living in South Africa who were fleeing xenophobic violence there. Nearly 60,000 refugees live in camps in Zambia, while 50,000 are mixed in with the local populations. Refugees who wish to work in Zambia must apply for permits, which can cost up to $500 per year.\nReligion.\nZambia is officially a \"Christian nation\" under the 1996 constitution, but recognizes and protects freedom of religion. Zambia is the only African nation to designate Christianity as a state religion. The Zambia Statistics Agency estimates that 95.5% of Zambians are Christian, with 75.3% Protestant and 20.2% Catholic. The Zambia Conference of Catholic Bishops is the Catholic episcopal conference. Many Zambian Christians are syncretic, combining indigenous religious traditions with Christianity. The largest Protestant denominations are the Anglicans, evangelicals, and Pentecostals.\nChristianity arrived to Zambia through European colonialism, and its wide variety of sects and movements reflect changing patterns of missionary activity; for example, Catholicism came from Portuguese Mozambique in the east, while Anglicanism reflects British influences from the south. Following its independence in 1964, Zambia saw a greater influx of other church missions from across the world, particularly North America and Germany. In subsequent decades, Western missionary roles have been assumed by native believers (except for some technical positions, such as physicians). After Frederick Chiluba, a Pentecostal Christian, became president in 1991, Pentecostal congregations expanded considerably around the country.\nSome Christian denominations with a relatively small global presence are popular in Zambia. The country has one of the world's largest communities of Seventh-day Adventists on a per-capita basis, accounting for about 1 in 18 Zambians. The Lutheran Church of Central Africa has over 11,000 members in the country. About 12 per cent of Zambians are members of the New Apostolic Church; with more than 1.2 million believers, the country has the third-largest community in Africa, out of a total worldwide membership of over 9 million.\nApproximately 2.7% of Zambians are Muslim, primarily Sunni with smaller numbers of Ismaili and Twelver Shia. The Muslim community, which numbers 100,000 according to one estimate, includes both refugees from the Congo and Somalia, as well as immigrants from South Asia and the Middle East who have become Zambian citizens. Hindus, primarily of South Asian ancestry, numbered approximately 10,000 as of 2019. At its peak in the 1960s, a small Jewish community in Zambia numbered about 1,000, mostly with origins in Lithuania, Latvia, and Germany; by 2012 there were fewer than 50 Zambian Jews, most of whom live in Lusaka and Northern Province. There are small numbers of Baha'is, Buddhists, and Sikhs.\nLanguages.\nThe exact number of Zambian languages is unknown, although many texts claim that Zambia has 73 languages and/or dialects; this figure is probably due to a non-distinction between language and dialect, based on the criterion of mutual intelligibility. On this basis, the number of Zambian languages would probably be only about 20 or 30.\nThe official language of Zambia is English, which is used for official business, education, and law. The main local language, especially in Lusaka, is Nyanja (Chewa), followed by Bemba. In the Copperbelt, Bemba is the main language and Nyanja second. Bemba and Nyanja are spoken in the urban areas, in addition to other indigenous languages that are commonly spoken in Zambia. These include Lozi, Tumbuka, Kaonde, Tonga, Lunda and Luvale, which featured on the Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation (ZNBC) local-languages section.\nUrbanisation has had a dramatic effect on some of the indigenous languages, including the assimilation of words from other languages. Urban dwellers sometimes differentiate between urban and rural dialects of the same language by prefixing the rural languages with 'deep'.\nMost will thus speak Bemba and Nyanja in the Copperbelt; Nyanja is predominantly spoken in Lusaka and Eastern Zambia. English is used in official communications and is the language of choice at home among\u00a0\u2013 now common\u00a0\u2013 interethnic families. This evolution of languages has led to Zambian slang heard throughout Lusaka and other major cities. The majority of Zambians usually speak more than one language: the official language, English, and the most spoken language in the town or area they live in. Portuguese has been introduced as a second language into the school curriculum due to the presence of a large Portuguese-speaking Angolan community. French is commonly studied in private schools, while some secondary schools have it as an optional subject. A German course has been introduced at the University of Zambia (UNZA).\nEducation.\nThe right to equal and adequate education for all is enshrined within the Zambian constitution. The Education Act of 2011 regulates equal and quality education. The English-language literacy rate as of 2018 is 86.7%.\nThe government's annual expenditure on education has varied significantly. As a percentage of the government budget, it was 19.6% in 2006, 15.3% in 2011, and 20.2% in 2015. As of 2020, education expenditures constituted 3.7% of GDP.\nHealth.\nZambia is experiencing a generalised HIV/AIDS epidemic, with a national HIV prevalence rate of 12.10 per cent among adults. However, the country has made progress over the past decade: The prevalence rate of HIV/AIDS for adults aged 15\u201349 decreased to 13 per cent in 2013/14, compared to 16 per cent roughly a decade earlier. Other health outcomes have also improved significantly, despite remaining poor by global standards. The maternal mortality rate in 2020 was 135 per 100,000 live births, compared to 169 in 2014 and 296 in 2007; over the same period, the mortality rate of children under five dropped to 59.3 per 1,000 live births in 2020 from 69.2 and 93.3 in 2014 and 2007 respectively.\nEconomy.\nIn 2022, Zambia averages between $7.5\u00a0billion and $8\u00a0billion of exports annually. It totaled $9.1\u00a0billion worth of exports in 2018. In 2015, about 54.4% of Zambians lived below the recognised national poverty line, improved from 60.5% in 2010. Rural poverty rates were about 76.6% and urban rates at about 23.4%. The national poverty line was ZMK 214 (USD 12.85) per month. As of the latest estimate in 2018 by the United Nations Development Programme, 47.9 percent of the population continued to be affected by multidimensional poverty. Unemployment and underemployment in urban areas are serious problems. Most rural Zambians are subsistence farmers.\nZambia was ranked 112nd in the Global Innovation Index in 2025. Social indicators continue to decline, particularly in measurements of life expectancy at birth (about 40.9 years) and maternal mortality (830 per 100,000 pregnancies) in 2007. By 2023, the life expectancy at birth had risen again to around 62 years.\nZambia fell into poverty after international copper prices declined in the 1970s. The socialist regime made up for falling revenue with several abortive attempts at International Monetary Fund structural adjustment programmes (SAPs). The policy of not trading through the main supply route and line of rail to the sea\u00a0\u2013 the territory was known as Rhodesia (from 1965 to 1979), and now known as Zimbabwe\u00a0\u2013 cost the economy greatly. After the Kaunda regime, (from 1991) successive governments began limited reforms. The economy stagnated until the late 1990s. In 2007 Zambia recorded its ninth consecutive year of economic growth. Inflation was 8.9%, down from 30% in 2000.\nZambia is still dealing with economic reform issues such as the size of the public sector, and improving Zambia's social sector delivery systems. Economic regulations and red tape are extensive, and corruption is widespread. The bureaucratic procedures surrounding the process of obtaining licences encourages the widespread use of facilitation payments. Zambia's total foreign debt exceeded $6\u00a0billion when the country qualified for Highly Indebted Poor Country Initiative (HIPC) debt relief in 2000, contingent upon meeting certain performance criteria. Initially, Zambia hoped to reach the HIPC completion point, and benefit from substantial debt forgiveness, in late 2003.\nIn January 2003, the Zambian government informed the International Monetary Fund and World Bank that it wished to renegotiate some of the agreed performance criteria calling for privatisation of the Zambia National Commercial Bank and the national telephone and electricity utilities. Although agreements were reached on these issues, subsequent overspending on civil service wages delayed Zambia's final HIPC debt forgiveness from late 2003 to early 2005, at the earliest. In an effort to reach HIPC completion in 2004, the government drafted an austerity budget for 2004, freezing civil service salaries and increasing the number of taxes. The tax hike and public sector wage freeze prohibited salary increases and new hires. This sparked a nationwide strike in February 2004.\nThe Zambian government is pursuing an economic diversification programme to reduce the economy's reliance on the copper industry. This initiative seeks to exploit other components of Zambia's rich resource base by promoting agriculture, tourism, gemstone mining, and hydro-power. In July 2018, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan and Zambia's president Edgar Lungu signed 12 agreements in capital Lusaka on areas ranging from trade and investment to tourism and diplomacy.\nMining.\nMining and quarrying accounted for approximately 13.2% of the Zambian GDP in 2019. The Zambian economy has historically been based on the copper mining industry. The industry was nationalized in 1973; under government control, production declined substantially. After privatisation during the period 1996\u20132000, investment, production, and jobs in the copper sector increased. As of 2019, copper exports constituted about 69% of the value of all Zambian goods exported. In 2023, Zambia produced 698,000 metric tons of copper. It is the second-largest copper producer in Africa and the seventh-largest copper producer in the world, accounting for 4% of global production. The Copperbelt Province of Zambia accounts for almost one-quarter of the country's GDP and one-third of the country's copper production. The state-owned ZCCM Investments Holdings owns several mining operations; it holds a 49% stake in Mopani Copper Mines, with the remaining 51% held by the United Arab Emirates through the International Holding Company. ZCCM has interests in mining operations owned by Vedanta Resources and First Quantum Minerals. As Zambia's economy is heavily dependent on the copper industry, the national exchange rate changes in accordance with the copper price. The Chinese government, via state-owned firms and as part of its Belt and Road Initiative, has made substantial foreign direct investments in Zambian copper to secure this strategic resource for the Chinese market. The Chinese firm JCHX Mining owns 80% of Zambia's Lubambe Copper Mines, with ZCCM holding the remaining 20%. Hazardous working conditions, low wages, and labor abuses at the Chinese-operated Collum Coal Mine have been a source of political controversy in Zambia. In addition to copper, major minerals mined in Zambia include gold (Kansanshi mine), manganese (Serenje mine), and nickel (Munali mine), as well as gemstones (specifically amethyst, beryl, emerald, and tourmaline).\nAgriculture.\nAgriculture plays a very important part in Zambia's economy providing many more jobs than the mining industry.\nA small number of white Zimbabwean farmers were welcomed into Zambia after their expulsion by Robert Mugabe, whose numbers had reached roughly 150 to 300 people as of 2004[ [update]]. They farm a variety of crops including tobacco, wheat, and chili peppers on an estimated 150 farms. The skills they brought, combined with general economic liberalisation under the late Zambian president Levy Mwanawasa, has been credited with stimulating an agricultural boom in Zambia. In 2004, for the first time in 26 years, Zambia exported more corn than it imported. In December 2019, the Zambian government unanimously decided to legalise cannabis for medicinal and export purposes only.\nTourism.\nTourism comprised 5.8% of the Zambian GDP in 2021; the record high, of 9.8%, occurred in 2019. Most tourism focused on wildlife protected areas, specifically Zambia's 20 national parks and 34 game management areas. The most significant tourist site, the Victoria Falls, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Zambian side of the falls is within Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park; the rest of the falls are part of neighboring Zimbabwe. Livingstone, which lies close to Victoria Falls, has become an important tourist centre. Other popular national parks include North Luangwa, South Luangwa, Kafue, and Liuwa Plain. The Zambian government has promoted tourism as a tool for economic development, particularly in rural areas, as well as for wildlife conservation.\nEnergy.\nIn 2009, Zambia generated 10.3 TWh of electricity and has been rated high in use of both solar power and hydroelectricity. However, early 2015[ [update]], Zambia began experiencing a serious energy shortage due to the poor 2014/2015 rain season, which resulted in low water levels at the Kariba dam and other major dams. In September 2019, African Green Resources (AGR) announced that it would invest $150\u00a0million in 50 megawatt (MW) solar farm, along with irrigation dam and expanding the existing grain silo capacity by 80,000 tonnes.\nCulture.\nPrior to the establishment of modern Zambia, the inhabitants lived in independent tribes, each with its own way of life. One of the results of the colonial era was the growth of urbanisation. Different ethnic groups started living together in towns and cities, influencing each other's way of life. They also started adopting aspects of global or universal culture, especially in terms of dressing and mannerisms. Much of the original cultures of Zambia have largely survived in rural areas, with some outside influences such as Christianity. Cultures that are specific to certain ethnic groups within Zambia are known as 'Zambian cultures' while those lifestyles that are common across ethnic groups are labelled \"Zambian culture\" because they are practiced by almost every Zambian. In the urban setting, there is a continuous integration and evolution of these cultures to produce what is called \"Zambian culture\".\nZambia practices several ceremonies and rituals ranging from nationally recognised traditional ceremonies to unrecognised yet important ceremonies. Many of the ceremonies and rituals are performed on special occasions celebrating or marking achievements, anniversaries, the passage of time, coronations and presidential occasions, atonement and purification, graduation, dedication, oaths of allegiance, initiation, marriage, funeral, birth ceremonies and others.\nLike most African countries, Zambia practices both disclosed and undisclosed ceremonies and rituals. Among the disclosed ceremonies and rituals include calendrical or seasonal, contingent, affliction, divination, initiation and regular or daily ceremonies. Undisclosed ceremonies include those practiced in secret such by spiritual groups like Nyau and Nakisha dancers and traditional marriage counsellors such as alangizi women. As of December 2016, Zambia had 77 calendrical or seasonal traditional ceremonies recognized by government, and this number will increase in the near future. The ceremonies once a year include Nc'wala, Kulonga, Kuomboka, Malaila, Nsengele, Chibwela kumushi, Dantho, Ntongo, Makundu, Lwiindi, Chuungu, and Lyenya. These are known as Zambian traditional ceremonies. Some of the more prominent are: Kuomboka and Kathanga (Western Province), Mutomboko (Luapula Province), Kulamba and Ncwala (Eastern Province), Lwiindi and Shimunenga (Southern Province), Lunda Lubanza (North Western), Likumbi Lyamize (North Western), Mbunda Lukwakwa (North Western Province), Chibwela Kumushi (Central Province), Vinkhakanimba (Muchinga Province), Ukusefya Pa Ng'wena (Northern Province).\nPopular traditional arts include pottery, basketry (such as Tonga baskets), stools, fabrics, mats, wooden carvings, ivory carvings, wire craft, and copper crafts. Most Zambian traditional music is based on drums (and other percussion instruments) with a lot of singing and dancing. In urban areas, foreign genres of music are popular, particularly Congolese rumba, African-American music and Jamaican reggae.\nMedia.\nWhile freedom of expression and of the press are constitutionally guaranteed in Zambia, the government frequently restricts these rights in practice. Although the ruling Patriotic Front has pledged to free state-owned media\u2014consisting of the Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation (ZNBC) and the widely circulated \"Zambia Daily Mail\" and \"Times of Zambia\"\u2014from government editorial control, these outlets have generally continued to report along pro-government lines. Many journalists reportedly practice self-censorship since most government newspapers do have prepublication review. The ZNBC dominates the broadcast media, though several private stations have the capacity to reach large portions of the population.\nSports and games.\nSports and games are common social aspects of Zambian culture(s) that bring people together for learning, development of skills, fun and joyous moments. Sports and games in Zambia include but are not limited to football, athletics, netball, volleyball and indigenous games such as nsolo, chiyenga, waida, hide and seek, walyako, and sojo. These are some of the indigenous games that support socialisation. All these sports and games are part of the Zambian culture(s). The fact that the games are played by more than one person makes them social and edutainment events. The history of some of these games is as old as Zambians themselves. However, Zambia started taking part in popular global sports and games mainly in 1964 Summer olympics. \nZambia declared its independence on the day of the closing ceremony of the 1964 Summer Olympics, thereby becoming the first country ever to have entered an Olympic Games as one country and left it as another. In 2016, Zambia participated for the thirteenth time in the Olympic games. Two medals were won. The medals were won successively in boxing and on the track. In 1984 Keith Mwila won a bronze medal in the light flyweight. In 1996 Samuel Matete won a silver medal in the 400-metre hurdles. Zambia has never participated in the Winter Olympics.\nFootball is the most popular sport in Zambia, and the Zambia national football team has had its triumphant moments in football history. At the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, the national team defeated the Italian national team by a score of 4\u20130. Kalusha Bwalya, Zambia's most celebrated football player, scored a hat trick in that match. However, to this day, many pundits say the greatest team Zambia has ever assembled was the one that perished on 28 April 1993 in a plane crash at Libreville, Gabon. Despite this, in 1996, Zambia was ranked 15th on the official FIFA World Football Team rankings, the highest attained by any southern African team. In 2012, Zambia won the African Cup of Nations for the first time after losing in the final twice. They beat C\u00f4te d'Ivoire 8\u20137 in a penalty shoot-out in the final, which was played in Libreville, just a few kilometers away from the plane crash 19 years previously. The Zambia women's national football team made its FIFA Women's World Cup debut at the 2023 tournament in Australia and New Zealand, the Zambia team being one of four representing the Confederation of African Football (CAF). They won their first Women's World Cup game in their first year, with Lushomo Mweemba scoring the fastest goal at the tournament, and Barbara Banda adding the 1,000th goal in WWC tournament history.\nRugby Union, boxing and cricket are also popular sports in Zambia. Recently, Zambia's membership has been formally restored by ICC ( International Cricket Council) on 2025. Notably, at one point in the early 2000s, the Australia and South Africa national rugby teams were captained by players born in the same Lusaka hospital, George Gregan and Corn\u00e9 Krige. Until 2014, the Roan Antelope Rugby Club in Luanshya held the Guinness World Record for the tallest rugby union goal posts in the world at 110\u00a0ft, 6 inches high. This world record is now held by the Wednesbury Rugby Club.\nRugby union in Zambia is a minor but growing sport. They are currently ranked 73rd by the IRB and have 3,650 registered players and three \"formally organised\" clubs. Zambia used to play cricket as part of Rhodesia. Zambia has also provided a shinty international, Zambian-born Eddie Tembo representing Scotland in the compromise rules Shinty/Hurling game against Ireland in 2008.\nIn 2011, Zambia was due to host the tenth All-Africa Games, for which three stadiums were to be built in Lusaka, Ndola, and Livingstone. The Lusaka stadium would have a capacity of 70,000 spectators while the other two stadiums would hold 50,000 people each. The government was encouraging the private sector to get involved in the construction of the sports facilities because of a shortage of public funds for the project. Zambia later withdrew its bid to host the 2011 All-Africa Games, citing a lack of funds. Hence, Mozambique took Zambia's place as host.\nZambia also produced the first black African (Madalitso Muthiya) to play in the United States Golf Open, one of the four major golf tournaments. \nIn 1989, the country's basketball team had its best performance when it qualified for the FIBA Africa Championship and thus finished as one of Africa's top ten teams. In 2017, Zambia hosted and won the Pan-African football tournament U-20 African Cup of Nation for players age 20 and under.\nMusic and dance.\nZambia's culture has been an integral part of their development post-independence such as the uprising of cultural villages and private museums. The music which introduced dance is part of their cultural expression and it embodies the beauty and spectacle of life in Zambia, from the intricacies of the talking drums to the \"Kamangu\" drum used to announce the beginning of \"Malaila\" traditional ceremony. Dance as a practice serves as a unifying factor bringing the people together as one.\nZamrock.\nZamrock is a musical genre that emerged in the 1970s, and has developed a cult following in the West. Zamrock has been described as mixing traditional Zambian music with heavy repetitive riffs similar to groups such as Jimi Hendrix, James Brown, Black Sabbath, Rolling Stones, Deep Purple, and Cream. Notable groups in the genre include Rikki Ililonga and his band Musi-O-Tunya, WITCH, Chrissy \"Zebby\" Tembo, and Paul Ngozi and his Ngozi Family.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "34416", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34416", "title": "Zingiberales", "text": "Order of flowering plants\nThe Zingiberales are flowering plants forming one of four orders in the commelinids clade of monocots, together with its sister order, Commelinales. The order includes 68 genera and 2,600 species. Zingiberales are a unique though morphologically diverse order that has been widely recognised as such over a long period of time. They are usually large herbaceous plants with rhizomatous root systems and lacking an aerial stem except when flowering. Flowers are usually large and showy, and the stamens are often modified (staminodes) to also form colourful petal-like structures that attract pollinators.\nZingiberales contain eight families that are informally considered as two groups, differing in the number of fertile stamens. A \"banana group\" of four families appeared first and were named on the basis of large banana-like leaves. Later, a more genetically coherent (monophyletic) \"ginger group\" appeared, consisting of the remaining four families. The order, which has a fossil record, is thought to have originated in the Early Cretaceous period between 80 and 120 million years ago (Mya), most likely in Australia, and diverged relatively rapidly with the families as they are known today established by the end of the period (66 Mya). Zingiberales are found throughout the tropics (pantropical) with some extension into subtropical and temperate climates. They rely on insects for pollination, together with some birds and small animals.\nThe order includes many familiar plants, and are used as ornamental plants (Bird of Paradise flower, heliconias, prayer-plants), food crops (bananas, plantains, arrowroot), spices and traditional medicines (ginger, cardamom, turmeric, galangal, fingerroot and myoga).\nDescription.\nZingiberales are one of an ecologically and morphologically diverse and species-rich order of monocots, with one of the most distinct floral morphology. They are large rhizomatous herbaceous plants but lacking an aerial stem, except when flowering.\nLeaves usually petiolate with distinct petiole and lamina, leaf arrangement distichous (spiral in Musaceae). Venation pinnate-parallelodromous, with midrib (midvein), S-shaped lateral veins and fine transverse venation.\nFlowers are generally large and showy, following the general monocot pattern, with inflorescences in thyrse-like spikes, zygomorphic to asymmetric, with two trimerous whorls of tepals. Gynoecium tricarpellate, ovary epigynous (inferior), two trimerous androecial whorls with stamens 6, 5 or 1. Stamens have elongated sterile filaments to which are attached anthers, distally, comprising about half of the length of the total stamen. Septal nectaries often present. Pollen sulcate but often inaperturate (lacking apertures).\nFruit capsular or schizocarp. Phytochemistry: Often containing raphides,\nSpecific characteristics which help to distinguish this order include a herbaceous arborescent stem, distichous phyllotaxy, large petiolate leaves in which the petioles are often long, parallel and transverse venation diverging laterally from a prominent common midrib, and inflorescences of conspicuous colorful bracts (bracteate inflorescence) and the substitution of one to five rudimentary staminodia for fertile stamens.\nLeaf architecture is useful for distinguishing families within Zingiberales, based on vein pattern type, vein length per area, and other aspects of vein architecture such as angle of vein divergence, with three main types of venation recognised. These are the \"Zingiber\"-type, with square to vertically elongate areoles, the \"Costus\"-type, with horizontally elongate areoles and the \"Orchidantha\"-type with cross veins spanning multiple parallel veins.\nApomorphies.\nThe apomorphies (derived characteristics common to a taxonomic group) are considered to be specialised isomorphic root hair cells, penni-parallel leaf venation, supervolute ptyxis (left and right halves of immature leaf lamina rolled into each other), diaphragmed air chambers in leaves and stem, presence of intracellular silica bodies, epigynous flowers and an inferior ovary, pollen grains without distinctive aperture but with a reduced exine layer and an elaborated intine layer, nuclear endosperm development, and arillate seeds.\nTaxonomy.\n \"The Zingiberiflorae, whether treated as a separate superorder, as here, or an order in a more widely circumscribed unit, is one of the most indisputably natural suprafamilial groups.\"\nHistory.\nThe Zingiberales have always been considered a unique and coherent (monophyletic) group, although accounting for &lt;4% of extant monocots, which has led some authors to suggest they should constitute a higher taxonomic rank than order. For a brief history of the taxonomy of this order, see Scitamineae, and Kress 1990. They were first described by August Grisebach, their botanical authority, in 1854 as Zingiberides, an order of monocotyledons, subdivided into two families, Scitamineae and Musaceae.\nBased on morphological grounds alone, early systems, such as Bentham and Hooker (1883) placed the Scitamineae as an \"Ordo\" (family) of the Epigynae alliance in the monocotyledons, incorporating both of Grisebach's families. Later systems such as the Engler system (1903) and the Wettstein system (1924), also considered Scitamineae as a monocotyledon order and were influential for a long period of time. Variants included Scitaminales (Warming 1912). Hutchinson (1926), although initially using Scitamineae, later followed Takenoshin Nakai (1930). in adopting Zingiberales as the name for the order (6 families) in Division Calyciferae, although credit is generally given to Nakai. This usage was followed by Takhtajan (1966) within superorder Lilianae and by Dahlgren (1985) in its own superorder Zingiberiflorae.\nIn contrast the Cronquist system retained Scitamineae as the name for this order with eight families, but organised the order in the subclass Zingiberidae of the class Liliopsida (monocotyledons).\nModern era.\nUsing molecular phylogenetics, which was first applied to the order in 1993, the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) system (1998), (which generally followed Dahlgren, but with fewer divisions) confirmed the position of Zingiberales as a monophyletic order within the monocots, placing it in the commelinoid clade, as sister group to Commelinales, which Dahlgren had treated within a separate superorder. This was an ordinal system that did not examine subordinal structure. The 2003 revision (APG II) changed commelinoid to commelinid, but not the relationships, and this remained unchanged in the subsequent 2009 APG III system and 2016 APG IV system without addressing interfamilial relationships.\nSubdivision.\nThe order, which now has more than 2,600 species, distributed in 68 genera over eight families, has been subdivided from early times. In the Bentham &amp; Hooker system (1883), their Ordo Scitamineae had four tribes: Zingibereae, Maranteae, Canneae, and Museae. These have become progressively divided to form the modern phyletic classification into the following monophyletic families: Zingiberaceae (gingers), Musaceae (bananas), Heliconiaceae (heliconias), Strelitziaceae (bird-of-paradise), Costaceae (spiral gingers), Cannaceae (canna lilies), Marantaceae (prayer plants), and Lowiaceae (Orchidantha). The APG II system (2003) provided a classification of families for the first time, retaining Kress's eight families.\nBased on morphology alone, the Zingiberales have been considered to form two main groups, each with four families, utilising the number of fertile stamens;\nPhylogeny.\nUsing combined morphology and molecular data, Kress and colleagues (1993, 1995, 2001) confirmed the broad separation into two clades based on morphology alone, and produced an infraordinal structure. In this scheme, they divided the families of the order as follows, with the ginger group as one suborder, and the banana group divided amongst three separate suborders:\nSuborder Zingiberineae (\"gingers\"; 2 superfamilies)\nSuborder Strelitziineae \nSuborder Musineae \nSuborder Heliconiineae \nWhile the two sister family groups that constitute the Zingiberineae (Cladogram I) and also the basal Strelitziineae (Strelitziaceae-Lowiaceae) sister group (Cladogram II) were strongly supported, the position of Musaceae and Heliconiaceae were not. In the above model (Model 1), Musaceae appears as the first branching family, and Heliconiaceae placed as sister to the Zingiberineae (Cladogram III). Other studies placed these and the Strelitziaceae-Lowiaceae sister group in a trichotomy with the remaining families. While a revision of the first model (Model 2) placed Heliconiaceae as the first branching lineage with Musaceae in a sister relationship with Strelitziineae, which in turn was sister to Zingiberineae (Cladogram IV). A third model (Model 3) supports Musaceae as the basal group but places Heliconiaceae as sister to Strelitziineae (Cladogram V). The failure to resolve the ancient rapid divergences of this order with multi-gene phylogenies and plastid data has important implications for understanding the evolution of characteristics.\nFinally in 2016 Sass and colleagues, using multiplexed exon capture were able to resolve the entire phylogenetic tree with high support. This confirmed the place of Musaceae as sister to the remaining families, confirming Model 3.\nEvolution.\nThe common ancestor of the Zingiberales together with those of its sister order, the Commelinales, is estimated to have originated 158 Mya (million years ago) in the Early Cretaceous, with separation of the two orders between 80 and 124 Mya, and with rapid radiation into the major lineages in the mid Cretaceous ca. 60\u2013100 Mya and six of the eight families established by the end of the Cretaceous, Estimates of crown group age (most recent common ancestor of the sampled species of the clade of interest) vary widely between 34 and 110 Mya, and may need revision in the light of developing knowledge of the topology of the order.\nFossil-calibrated molecular estimates suggest a date of 110 to 80 Mya for the diversification of primary lineages. If Musaceae is the stem family of the order, as seems likely this places the origin of Zingiberales ca. 124\u00a0Mya, with diversification occurring ca. 110 Mya in the middle Cretaceous. That origin (124 Mya) was congruent with the breakup of the southern land mass, Gondwana.\nProbably the ancestral Zingiberales were distributed in tropical Gondwanal and encompassing present-day Americas, Africa, and Southeast Asia. Within this land mass, Australia seems the most likely ancestral area, with subsequent dispersals between Africa and neotropical America. Earlier studies had implied Southeast Asia as the origin. The current distribution of the Zingiberales seems to be a product of numerous secondary and tertiary dispersal events between the major tropical regions of the world.\nZingiberales demonstrate an evolutionary trend in the ontogeny of the perianth (sepals and petals). The appearance of a dimorphic perianth (in which petals and sepals differ in appearance) is variable throughout the commelinid monocots, with a transition from an undifferentiated monomorphic perianth to a dimorphic one occurring independently in the two sister orders, Commelinales and the Zingiberales. The evolution of floral morphology within Zingiberales demonstrates a marked correlation between the reduction of the number of fertile stamens, and increased petaloidy. The ancestral Zingiberales flower is thought to have had 5\u20136 fertile stamens, following which the staminode evolved in the lineage leading to Heliconiaceae+Zingiberineae, finally leading to 2\u20135 staminodia dominating the floral display.\nThe phylogenetic diversification and biogeographic dispersal of the Zingiberales was, in part, driven by the evolutionary radiation and diversification of their associated animal pollinators, which include bats, birds, non-flying mammals and insects. Six of the eight families of the Zingiberales contain taxa specialised for pollination by vertebrates, which appears to be the plesiomorphic state in the order. Of these six families two are exclusively vertebrate-pollinated (Strelitziaceae, Heliconiaceae). Pollination by insects also occurs in six families with one (Marantaceae) or possibly two (Lowiaceae) families predominantly specialised for insect visitors.\nFossil record.\nSeed and fruit fossils of the Zingiberales appear in the Santonian of the Late Cretaceous, ca. 85\u00a0Mya, and thought to represent Musaceae and Zingiberaceae, but the place of the oldest Zingiberales fossil, \"Spirematospermum\" with its distinctive seeds remains uncertain, but is most likely Zingiberaceae. The leaf fossil record for Zingiberales also extends back to the Late Cretaceous. Other fossil records include rhizomes and phytoliths.\nDiversity and biogeography.\nThe four families of the basal banana group exhibit less taxonomic diversity than the terminal ginger group. The three genera of Musaceae are distributed in tropical Asia and Africa, although fossil evidence reveals their presence in North America and Africa in the Tertiary, while the three genera of Strelitziaceae are allopatric (isolated from each other) being found in Madagascar, southern Africa and the Amazon Basin respectively and Lowiaceae occurs in Southeast Asia. The largest family in this group, the Heliconiaceae is primarily neotropical, but also occurs in the Pacific from Samoa to Sulawesi.\nOf the four Zingiberineae (gingers) families, three (Zingiberaceae, Costaceae, Marantaceae) are pantropical. The fourth, Cannaceae is restricted to the New World, although widely cultivated. This suborder contains the two largest families (Zingiberaceae and Marantaceae) and the largest number of species.\nDistribution and habitat.\nZingiberales are pantropical and occur predominantly in the wet tropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas, occupying nearly all tropical wet lowlands or middle elevation forests as part of the understory flora. In addition five genera from three of the Zingiberineae families, including \"Canna\" extend into subtropical and temperate regions. Of the eight families, Heliconiaceae, Marantaceae, and Costaceae are predominantly neotropical and Zingiberaceae most prevalent in Southeast Asian wet understory habitats. These are mainly small to medium-sized herbaceous taxa or vines. While some herbaceous Zingiberaceae such as \"Alpinia boia\" can attain a height of ten metres, only one species is a true canopy plant (\"Ravenala madagascariensis\" \u2013 Strelitziaceae). The latter, a Madagascar endemic, has thick, palm-like trunks which push the fan-shaped crown of leaves up into the top layers of the forest. Some Zingiberales prefer a greater degree of light and are found in forest glades or margins, or in open secondary growth along streams and rivers.\nThe large family Zingiberaceae has a number of subfamilies, one of which, Zingiberoideae, has members that have adapted to Southeast Asia's monsoonal climates. They do so by becoming dormant in the dry season, which may last four to six months, shedding all above ground parts, existing only as underground fleshy underground rhizomes, some of which have starch rich tubers. With the onset of the wet season, they send up shoots and complete their life cycle during this time. Some taxa within Marantaceae, Costaceae, and Musaceae also occur in these habitats and have adapted in this way, but no Zingiberales occur in true desert regions.\nIn contrast some Zingiberales, including taxa from Marantaceae, Heliconiaceae, Cannaceae (e.g. \"Canna glauca\") have adopted an aquatic habitat and are found along river margins, ponds, and swampy areas, with their rhizomes rooted underwater.\nEcology.\nZingiberales forms a major component of tropical and subtropical ecosystems. Many of these plants have formed specialised pollination relationships with mammals (e.g., bats and lemurs), birds and insects (e.g., bees, dung beetles, moths and butterflies) through alterations in floral form.\nUses.\nMany Zingiberales are horticulturally important and grown as ornamental plants, e.g., \"Heliconia\" (false bird-of-paradise), \"Strelitzia\" (bird-of-paradise), \"Maranta\" (prayer plants) and \"Canna\". Others are crop plants with culinary usage, e.g., \"Musa\" (bananas, plantains) and \"Zingiber\" (ginger). Zingiberales also include sources of traditional medicines and spices, \"e.g.\" Alpinieae such as \"Elettaria\" and \"Amomum\" (cardamom) and galanga and \"Curcuma\" (turmeric).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "34417", "revid": "933709", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34417", "title": "Zero-sum game", "text": "Situation where total gains match total losses\nZero-sum game is a mathematical representation in game theory and economic theory of a situation that involves two competing entities, where the result is an advantage for one side and an equivalent loss for the other. In other words, player one's gain is equivalent to player two's loss, with the result that the net improvement in benefit of the game is zero.\nIf the total gains of the participants are added up, and the total losses are subtracted, they will sum to zero. Thus, cutting a cake, where taking a more significant piece reduces the amount of cake available for others as much as it increases the amount available for that taker, is a zero-sum game if all participants value each unit of cake equally. Other examples of zero-sum games in daily life include games like poker, chess, sport and bridge where one person gains and another person loses, which results in a zero-net benefit for every player. In the markets and financial instruments, futures contracts and options are zero-sum games as well.\nIn contrast, non-zero-sum describes a situation in which the interacting parties' aggregate gains and losses can be less than or more than zero. A zero-sum game is also called a \"strictly competitive\" game, while non-zero-sum games can be either competitive or non-competitive. Zero-sum games are most often solved with the minimax theorem which is closely related to linear programming duality, or with Nash equilibrium. Prisoner's Dilemma is a classic non-zero-sum game.\nDefinition.\nThe zero-sum property (if one gains, another loses) means that any result of a zero-sum situation is Pareto optimal. Generally, any game where all strategies are Pareto optimal is called a conflict game.\nZero-sum games are a specific example of constant sum games where the sum of each outcome is always zero. Such games are distributive, not integrative; the pie cannot be enlarged by good negotiation.\nIn situation where one decision maker's gain (or loss) does not necessarily result in the other decision makers' loss (or gain), they are referred to as non-zero-sum. Thus, a country with an excess of bananas trading with another country for their excess of apples, where both benefit from the transaction, is in a non-zero-sum situation. Other non-zero-sum games are games in which the sum of gains and losses by the players is sometimes more or less than what they began with.\nThe idea of Pareto optimal payoff in a zero-sum game gives rise to a generalized relative selfish rationality standard, the punishing-the-opponent standard, where both players always seek to minimize the opponent's payoff at a favourable cost to themselves rather than prefer more over less. The punishing-the-opponent standard can be used in both zero-sum games (e.g. warfare game, chess) and non-zero-sum games (e.g. pooling selection games). The player in the game has a simple enough desire to maximise the profit for them, and the opponent wishes to minimise it.\nSolution.\nFor two-player finite zero-sum games, if the players are allowed to play a mixed strategy, the game always has at least one equilibrium solution. The different game theoretic solution concepts of Nash equilibrium, minimax, and maximin all give the same solution. Notice that this is not true for pure strategy.\nExample.\nA game's payoff matrix is a convenient representation. Consider these situations as an example, the two-player zero-sum game pictured at right or above.\nThe order of play proceeds as follows: The first player (red) chooses in secret one of the two actions 1 or 2; the second player (blue), unaware of the first player's choice, chooses in secret one of the three actions A, B or C. Then, the choices are revealed and each player's points total is affected according to the payoff for those choices.\n\"Example: Red chooses action 2 and Blue chooses action B. When the payoff is allocated, Red gains 20 points and Blue loses 20 points.\"\nIn this example game, both players know the payoff matrix and attempt to maximize the number of their points. Red could reason as follows: \"With action 2, I could lose up to 20 points and can win only 20, and with action 1 I can lose only 10 but can win up to 30, so action 1 looks a lot better.\" With similar reasoning, Blue would choose action C. If both players take these actions, Red will win 20 points. If Blue anticipates Red's reasoning and choice of action 1, Blue may choose action B, so as to win 10 points. If Red, in turn, anticipates this trick and goes for action 2, this wins Red 20 points.\n\u00c9mile Borel and John von Neumann had the fundamental insight that probability provides a way out of this conundrum. Instead of deciding on a definite action to take, the two players assign probabilities to their respective actions, and then use a random device which, according to these probabilities, chooses an action for them. Each player computes the probabilities so as to minimize the maximum expected point-loss independent of the opponent's strategy. This leads to a linear programming problem with the optimal strategies for each player. This minimax method can compute probably optimal strategies for all two-player zero-sum games.\nFor the example given above, it turns out that Red should choose action 1 with probability and action 2 with probability , and Blue should assign the probabilities 0, , and to the three actions A, B, and C. Red will then win points on average per game.\nSolving.\nThe Nash equilibrium for a two-player, zero-sum game can be found by solving a linear programming problem. Suppose a zero-sum game has a payoff matrix M where element \"M\"\"i\",\"j\" is the payoff obtained when the minimizing player chooses pure strategy i and the maximizing player chooses pure strategy j (i.e. the player trying to minimize the payoff chooses the row and the player trying to maximize the payoff chooses the column). Assume every element of M is positive. The game will have at least one Nash equilibrium. The Nash equilibrium can be found (Raghavan 1994, p.\u00a0740) by solving the following linear program to find a vector u:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;Minimize:\nformula_1\nSubject to the constraints:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\"u\" \u2265 0\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\"M\u2009u\" \u2265 1.\nThe first constraint says each element of the u vector must be nonnegative, and the second constraint says each element of the M\u2009u vector must be at least 1. For the resulting u vector, the inverse of the sum of its elements is the value of the game. Multiplying u by that value gives a probability vector, giving the probability that the maximizing player will choose each possible pure strategy.\nIf the game matrix does not have all positive elements, add a constant to every element that is large enough to make them all positive. That will increase the value of the game by that constant, and will not affect the equilibrium mixed strategies for the equilibrium.\nThe equilibrium mixed strategy for the minimizing player can be found by solving the dual of the given linear program. Alternatively, it can be found by using the above procedure to solve a modified payoff matrix which is the transpose and negation of M (adding a constant so it is positive), then solving the resulting game.\nIf all the solutions to the linear program are found, they will constitute all the Nash equilibria for the game. Conversely, any linear program can be converted into a two-player, zero-sum game by using a change of variables that puts it in the form of the above equations and thus such games are equivalent to linear programs, in general.\nUniversal solution.\nIf avoiding a zero-sum game is an action choice with some probability for players, avoiding is always an equilibrium strategy for at least one player at a zero-sum game. For any two players zero-sum game where a zero-zero draw is impossible or non-credible after the play is started, such as poker, there is no Nash equilibrium strategy other than avoiding the play. Even if there is a credible zero-zero draw after a zero-sum game is started, it is not better than the avoiding strategy. In this sense, it's interesting to find reward-as-you-go in optimal choice computation shall prevail over all two players zero-sum games concerning starting the game or not.\nThe most common or simple example from the subfield of social psychology is the concept of \"social traps\". In some cases pursuing individual personal interest can enhance the collective well-being of the group, but in other situations, all parties pursuing personal interest results in mutually destructive behaviour.\nCopeland's review notes that an n-player non-zero-sum game can be converted into an (n+1)-player zero-sum game, where the n+1st player, denoted the \"fictitious player\", receives the negative of the sum of the gains of the other n-players (the global gain / loss).\nZero-sum three-person games.\nIt is clear that there are manifold relationships between players in a zero-sum three-person game, in a zero-sum two-person game, anything one player wins is necessarily lost by the other and vice versa; therefore, there is always an absolute antagonism of interests, and that is similar in the three-person game. A particular move of a player in a zero-sum three-person game would be assumed to be clearly beneficial to him and may disbenefits to both other players, or benefits to one and disbenefits to the other opponent. Particularly, parallelism of interests between two players makes a cooperation desirable; it may happen that a player has a choice among various policies: Get into a parallelism interest with another player by adjusting his conduct, or the opposite; that he can choose with which of other two players he prefers to build such parallelism, and to what extent. The picture on the left shows that a typical example of a zero-sum three-person game. If Player 1 chooses to defence, but Player 2 &amp; 3 chooses to offence, both of them will gain one point. At the same time, Player 1 will lose two-point because points are taken away by other players, and it is evident that Player 2 &amp; 3 has parallelism of interests.\nReal life example.\nEconomic benefits of low-cost airlines in saturated markets - net benefits or a zero-sum game.\nStudies show that the entry of low-cost airlines into the Hong Kong market brought in $671 million in revenue and resulted in an outflow of $294 million.\nTherefore, the replacement effect should be considered when introducing a new model, which will lead to economic leakage and injection. Thus introducing new models requires caution. For example, if the number of new airlines departing from and arriving at the airport is the same, the economic contribution to the host city may be a zero-sum game. Because for Hong Kong, the consumption of overseas tourists in Hong Kong is income, while the consumption of Hong Kong residents in opposite cities is outflow. In addition, the introduction of new airlines can also have a negative impact on existing airlines.\nConsequently, when a new aviation model is introduced, feasibility tests need to be carried out in all aspects, taking into account the economic inflow and outflow and displacement effects caused by the model.\nZero-sum games in financial markets.\nDerivatives trading may be considered a zero-sum game, as each dollar gained by one party in a transaction must be lost by the other, hence yielding a net transfer of wealth of zero.\nAn options contract - whereby a buyer purchases a derivative contract which provides them with the right to buy an underlying asset from a seller at a specified strike price before a specified expiration date \u2013 is an example of a zero-sum game. A futures contract \u2013 whereby a buyer purchases a derivative contract to buy an underlying asset from the seller for a specified price on a specified date \u2013 is also an example of a zero-sum game. This is because the fundamental principle of these contracts is that they are agreements between two parties, and any gain made by one party must be matched by a loss sustained by the other.\nIf the price of the underlying asset increases before the expiration date the buyer may exercise/ close the options/ futures contract. The buyers gain and corresponding sellers loss will be the difference between the strike price and value of the underlying asset at that time. Hence, the net transfer of wealth is zero.\nSwaps, which involve the exchange of cash flows from two different financial instruments, are also considered a zero-sum game. Consider a standard interest rate swap whereby Firm A pays a fixed rate and receives a floating rate; correspondingly Firm B pays a floating rate and receives a fixed rate. If rates increase, then Firm A will gain, and Firm B will lose by the rate differential (floating rate \u2013 fixed rate). If rates decrease, then Firm A will lose, and Firm B will gain by the rate differential (fixed rate \u2013 floating rate).\nWhilst derivatives trading may be considered a zero-sum game, it is important to remember that this is not an absolute truth. The financial markets are complex and multifaceted, with a range of participants engaging in a variety of activities. While some trades may result in a simple transfer of wealth from one party to another, the market as a whole is not purely competitive, and many transactions serve important economic functions.\nThe stock market is an excellent example of a positive-sum game, often erroneously labelled as a zero-sum game. This is a zero-sum fallacy: the perception that one trader in the stock market may only increase the value of their holdings if another trader decreases their holdings.\nThe primary goal of the stock market is to match buyers and sellers, but the prevailing price is the one which equilibrates supply and demand. Stock prices generally move according to changes in future expectations, such as acquisition announcements, upside earnings surprises, or improved guidance.\nFor instance, if Company C announces a deal to acquire Company D, and investors believe that the acquisition will result in synergies and hence increased profitability for Company C, there will be an increased demand for Company C stock. In this scenario, all existing holders of Company C stock will enjoy gains without incurring any corresponding measurable losses to other players.\nFurthermore, in the long run, the stock market is a positive-sum game. As economic growth occurs, demand increases, output increases, companies grow, and company valuations increase, leading to value creation and wealth addition in the market.\nComplexity.\nIt has been theorized by Robert Wright in his book \"\", that society becomes increasingly non-zero-sum as it becomes more complex, specialized, and interdependent.\nExtensions.\nReducing non-zero-sum games to zero-sum games.\nIn 1944, John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern proved that any non-zero-sum game for \"n\" players is equivalent to a zero-sum game with \"n\"\u00a0+\u00a01 players; the (\"n\"\u00a0+\u00a01)th player representing the negative of the total profit among the first \"n\" players.\nNon-linear utilities.\nArrow and Hurwicz studied two-player zero-sum games in which the payoff function may be non-linear (as in a concave game). They presented gradient methods for computing the value of such games.\nMisunderstandings.\nZero-sum games and particularly their solutions are commonly misunderstood by critics of game theory, usually with respect to the independence and rationality of the players, as well as to the interpretation of utility functions. Furthermore, the word \"game\" does not imply the model is valid only for recreational games.\nPolitics is sometimes called zero sum because in common usage the idea of a stalemate is perceived to be \"zero sum\"; politics and macroeconomics are not zero-sum games, however, because they do not constitute conserved systems. Applying zero-sum game logic to scenarios that are not zero-sum in nature may lead to incorrect conclusions. Zero-sum games are based on the notion that one person's win will result in the other person's loss, so naturally there is competition between the two. There are scenarios, however, where that is not the case. For instance, in some cases both sides cooperating and working together could result in both sides benefitting more than they otherwise would have. By applying zero-sum logic, we in turn create an unnecessary, and potentially harmful, sense of scarcity and hostility. Therefore, it is critical to make sure that zero-sum applications fit the given context.\nZero-sum thinking.\nIn psychology, zero-sum thinking refers to the perception that a given situation is like a zero-sum game, where one person's gain is equal to another person's loss. The term is derived from game theory. However, unlike the game theory concept, zero-sum thinking refers to a psychological construct\u2014a person's subjective interpretation of a situation. Zero-sum thinking is captured by the saying \"your gain is my loss\" (or conversely, \"your loss is my gain\").\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The original developers and others, as the company Infocom, expanded and split the game into three titles\u2014\"ZorkI: The Great Underground Empire\", \"ZorkII: The Wizard of Frobozz\", and \"ZorkIII: The Dungeon Master\"\u2014which were released commercially for a range of personal computers beginning in 1980. In \"Zork\", the player explores the abandoned Great Underground Empire in search of treasure. The player moves between the game's hundreds of locations and interacts with objects by typing commands in natural language that the game interprets. The program acts as a narrator, describing the player's location and the results of the player's commands. It has been described as the most famous piece of interactive fiction.\nThe original game, developed between 1977 and 1979 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), was inspired by \"Colossal Cave Adventure\" (1976), the first well-known example of interactive fiction and the first well-known adventure game. The developers wanted to make a similar game that was able to understand more complicated sentences than \"Adventure\"'s two-word commands. In 1979, they founded Infocom with several other colleagues at the MIT computer center. Blank and Joel Berez created a way to run a smaller portion of \"Zork\" on several brands of microcomputer, letting them commercialize the game as Infocom's first products. The first episode was published by Personal Software in 1980, after which Infocom purchased back the rights and self-published all three episodes beginning in late 1981.\n\"Zork\" was a massive success for Infocom, with sales increasing for years as the market for personal computers expanded. The first episode sold more than 38,000 copies in 1982, and around 150,000 copies in 1984. Collectively, the three episodes sold more than 680,000 copies through 1986, comprising more than one-third of Infocom's sales in this period. Infocom was purchased by Activision in 1986, leading to new \"Zork\" games beginning in 1987, as well as a series of books. Reviews of the episodes were very positive, with several reviewers calling \"Zork\" the best adventure game to date. Critics regard it as one of the greatest video games. Later historians have noted the game as foundational to the adventure game genre, as well as influencing the MUD and massively multiplayer online role-playing game genres. In 2007, \"Zork\" was included in the game canon by the Library of Congress as one of the ten most important video games in history.\nGameplay.\n\"Zork\" is a text-based adventure game wherein the player explores the ruins of the Great Underground Empire. The player types text commands for their character to traverse locations, solve puzzles, and collect treasure. The game has hundreds of locations, each with a name and description, and the player's commands interact with the objects, obstacles, and creatures within them. Commands can be one or two words (e.g., \"get lamp\" or \"north\") or more complex phrases (e.g., \"put the lamp and sword in the case\"). The command must fit the location's context (e.g., \"get lamp\" works only if a lamp is present). The program acts as a narrator, describing to the player their location and the results of certain actions. If the game does not understand the player's commands, it asks for the player to retype their actions. The program's replies are typically in a sarcastic, conversational tone, much as a Game Master would use in leading players in a tabletop role-playing game.\nThe original 1977 version of the game was a single release, \"Zork\". When it was converted into a commercial software title, it was divided into three episodes, with new and expanded sections added to the latter two episodes. Much of the game world is composed of puzzles that must eventually be solved, such as a set of buttons on a dam or a maze to be traversed. Some puzzles have more than one solution. For instance, since the \"Loud Room\" is too overwhelmingly loud for the player to perform actions, the player can either empty the nearby dam to stop the sound of water falling, or shout \"echo\" in the room to change its acoustics. In the first episode, or \"ZorkI\", a thief character is wandering the underground as well, taking items that have been left behind or even stealing from the player's possessions. The player can fight or evade the thief, and can recover stolen items from the thief's treasure room. Some locations contain antagonists that the player must fight or overcome. Beginning in \"ZorkII\" the player can learn magic spells to use in puzzles and combat. In dark areas, the player must carry a lantern or other light source to avoid being eaten by a monster called a grue. There is a limit to how much \"inventory\" one can carry, determined by the combined weight of objects, rather than the quantity.\nA principal goal of each episode is to collect all the treasures, many of which are hidden behind puzzles. As treasures are collected or tasks are accomplished, the player's score increases, providing a rough measure of how much of the game has been completed. The player may traverse the game world and solve puzzles in almost any order, although some passageways require problem-solving to get through, and some puzzles require the player to possess something gained from solving a different puzzle. In \"ZorkIII\", unlike in prior episodes, there is a timed component that directly affects the outcome. An earthquake will occur after about 130 moves, opening one passageway and closing another. In each episode, the treasures are needed to reach the conclusion of the game.\nPlot.\n\"Zork\" does not follow a linear storyline. Most of the setting is established through the game's written descriptions of items and locations, as well as manuals in later game releases. Long before the time the game is set in, the Quendor empire, having conquered everywhere above ground, built a massive cave complex to expand. Two hundred years later, the ruler Lord Dimwit Flathead renamed the empire to the Great Underground Empire and spent his reign building massive, largely pointless projects such as an underground dam and the royal museum. A century later, the empire's overspending caused it to collapse, and all the residents left. The abandoned empire is the setting of the three episodes of \"Zork\".\n\"Zork I\" begins with the unnamed player standing in an open field west of a white house, with a boarded front door; most of the game occurs underground, as do the subsequent episodes. In \"ZorkII\" the player learns of the Flatheads, and meets the Wizard of Frobozz, who was once a respected enchanter but was exiled by Lord Dimwit Flathead when his powers began to fade. The wizard appears randomly throughout the game and casts spells that begin with the letter \"F\" on the player. These have several effects, such as \"Fluoresce\", which causes the player to glow, and \"Freeze\", which keeps the player stuck in place for a few turns. In \"ZorkIII\" the player character gathers the garb of the Dungeon Master to become his successor. Once the player has all the items, they must feed an elderly man, who reveals himself as the Dungeon Master and shows them the doorway leading to the final hallway. After the player solves the final puzzles, the Dungeon Master appears and transforms the player to look like himself, signifying the player's succession to his position.\nDevelopment.\nInception.\nTim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling began developing \"Zork\" in May 1977. The four were members of the Dynamic Modelling Group, a computer science research division at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Laboratory for Computer Science\u2014Anderson, Blank, and Daniels as students and Lebling as a research staff member. Their work was inspired by \"Colossal Cave Adventure\", a text-based game that is the first well-known example of interactive fiction and the first well-known adventure game. \"Adventure\" was immensely popular among the small population of computer users of the time and a big hit at MIT in early 1977. By the end of May, players had managed to completely solve it.\nThe four programmers began to design a game that would be a \"better\" text adventure game, with inputs more complex than \"Adventure\"'s two-word commands and puzzles less obtuse. They believed that their division's MDL programming language would be better suited for processing complex text inputs than the Fortran code used in \"Adventure\". The group was familiar with creating video games: Blank and Anderson had worked on a multiplayer trivia game called \"Trivia\" (1976), and Lebling was heavily involved with \"Maze\" (1973), a multiplayer first-person shooter and the first 3D first-person game ever made. Lebling first created a natural language input system, or parser, that could process typed two-word instructions. Anderson and Blank built a small prototype text game to use it. \"Zork\"'s prototype was built for the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-10 mainframe computer, the only system that supported their programming language.\nWhile Lebling took a two-week vacation, Anderson, Blank, and Daniels designed an adventure game concept, which Anderson and Blank then developed as an early version of \"Zork\". This prototype contained simple versions of many concepts seen in the final game, including puzzles and locations. According to Anderson, \"it took time for people to learn how to write good problems\", and Lebling's first, uncomplex parser was only \"almost as smart as \"Adventure\"'s\". The game was unnamed, but the group had a habit of naming their programs \"zork\" until they were completed, a term in the MIT community for an in-development program. The group, referring to themselves as the \"implementers\", continued working on the game after Lebling returned, adding features and iterating on the parser through June 1977. Grues were added to replace pits that would kill players in the dark; while play-testing, Lebling noticed that his character fell into a pit while in the attic of the house.\nLebling contends that \"Adventure\" was one of \"Zork\"'s only influences, as there were few other games to emulate at the time. Although the game's combat is based on \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\", Lebling said the other developers had never played it. He also thought of the parser and associated text responses as taking on the role of the Dungeon Master from a \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" game, trying to lead the player through a story solely by describing it; this had also been the idea behind the parser in \"Adventure\".\nCreation.\nThe developers did not announce their game while it was in development, but a lack of security on the MIT systems meant that anyone who could access the PDP-10 computer over the ARPANET could see what programs were being run. As a result, a small community of people, many of whom had been involved in playing and contributing to \"Trivia\", would \"snoop\" on the system for new programs. They found the new \"Zork\" adventure game and spread word of it under that name. This community\u2014dozens or possibly hundreds of players, according to Lebling\u2014interacted with the developers as they created the game, playtesting additions and submitting bug reports. The implementers added a command transcript feature to keep track of what commands players tried to use unsuccessfully.\nBy the end of June, the game was approximately half the size of the final \"Zork\", and had a substantial community of players for the time. The group added locations such as a volcano and coal mine, and soon shifted their efforts to improving the game's engine and adding the ability to save the player's progress in the game. Following user requests, they also added the ability for the game to run on PDP-10 computers running different operating systems\u2014TENEX and TOPS-20\u2014which were much more popular than the Incompatible Timesharing System operating system the MIT computer used. These users then set up a mailing list to distribute updates to the game. The developers returned to creating new content in the fall of 1977, adding the \"Alice in Wonderland\" section and a system for fighting enemies.\nAround this time, community member Ted Hess at DEC decoded the protections the group had made for the source code, and another DEC employee, Bob Supnik, created a port of the game to Fortran. This port, released in March 1978, opened the game to a wider set of players without access to a PDP-10 mainframe. At the time, the team had decided to give the game an actual name besides \"zork\", and chose \"Dungeon\". This name was used for the Fortran version, which was spread through the DEC users group as one of its most popular pieces of software. TSR Hobbies claimed the title violated their trademark for \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\", and the developers reverted to their original title.\nOver the course of 1978, the team added the bank and Royal Zork Puzzle Museum sections, along with some puzzles and ideas suggested by players. The last puzzle was added in February 1979, though the team continued to release bug fix updates until the final update in January 1981. Anderson attributes this to the team running out of ideas and time, and having run out of space in the one megabyte of memory allocated for the game.\nVery little of the game was planned ahead of time, nor were aspects of the game specific to one developer; instead, whenever one of the developers had an idea they liked, that developer would add it to the game, developing the concept and writing the text to go with it. According to Lebling, Blank ended up focusing mostly on the parser, Anderson on the game code, Blank and Daniels on new puzzles, and Lebling on descriptions of locations. Anderson says that Blank wrote \"40 or 50\" iterations of the parser, and describes Daniels as designing puzzles that were then largely implemented by the others. He credits Blank with vehicles and saving, and Lebling with the robot, grues, and the fighting system. To immerse the player in the game, the developers decided not to describe the player character, removing any accidental descriptions or gendered pronouns. The text responses to the player's commands were frequently opinionated and sarcastic, a design choice that mirrored the group's speaking patterns. The team felt it would both make the system feel less like a computer and also train the player to write commands in a way that the parser could understand rather than ways it would misinterpret.\nInfocom.\nIn 1979, Anderson, Blank, Lebling, and five other members of the Dynamic Modelling Group incorporated Infocom as a software company for members to join after leaving MIT. No specific projects were initially agreed upon and Infocom had no paid employees, but discussions were focused on developing software for smaller mainframe computers. Blank and Joel Berez came up with a plan to make \"Zork\" work on personal microcomputers, which were then beginning to become popular and which would greatly expand the audience for the game. Although microcomputers had very limited memory space compared to mainframe computers, they felt the project might be viable using floppy disks and a custom programming language if the game was cut into two pieces.\nThe pair worked on the project through the summer and fall of 1979 without pay, as the new company had the funds for only the computers. They ported the game to a new Zork Implementation Language (ZIL), which would then be run on a standardized \"Z-machine\" software-based computer. For each type of microcomputer they wanted to release \"Zork\" or other ZIL-based games on, they could write an interpreter program that could run the Z-Machine instead of rewriting each game. Lebling divided \"Zork\" in half to create standalone episodes, modifying the game's layout to improve its flow and disconnecting locations now in separate episodes.\nBy the end of 1979 Berez had been elected the company's president. The core game was complete, but it had been run only on DECSYSTEM-20 and PDP-11 mainframe computers. Infocom purchased a TRS-80 personal computer early in 1980, which could run the game after Blank and Scott Cutler created an interpreter program. Infocom began preparing to release the first section under the title \"Zork: The Great Underground Empire\u00a0\u2013 PartI\". Mike Dornbrook, who had never played the game, tested it as an audience surrogate. He felt that the game would be wildly successful and develop a cult following, and urged Infocom to produce tie-in products like maps, hints, and shirts. The rest of the company was not convinced enough to start producing any such add-ons, but they did add an object in the game that gave an address for players to mail in for maps and hints in case it proved popular.\nThe game now complete, the company began looking for a professional publisher with store and distributor connections. They felt this was preferable to self-publishing. Berez approached Microsoft, who declined based on the game competing with \"Microsoft Adventure\" (1979), their version of \"Adventure\". Microsoft CEO Bill Gates was a fan of \"Zork\", but by the time he heard of the proposal, Infocom was in negotiations with another publisher, Personal Software, one of the first professional software publishing companies. Personal Software agreed to publish the game in June 1980, sending the company an advance payment. \"Zork: The Great Underground Empire\", also known as \"ZorkI\" or just \"Zork\", was published for the TRS-80 in December 1980. Since Personal Software declined to publish the 1979 PDP-11 version of the game, Infocom sold some copies earlier in the year after announcing it to PDP-11 user groups. Lebling later recalled that about twenty floppy disk copies were sold directly with Anderson's typewritten manual.\nBy the end of 1980, an Apple II version of \"ZorkI\" was completed and sold through Personal Software. Infocom began receiving requests for hints and maps as predicted, and Berez began handling map and poster orders while Dornbrook wrote customized hints for players; in September 1981 he founded the Zork Users Group as a separate company to handle all mail order sales and hint requests. Infocom eventually produced hint booklets with progressive answers to questions written in invisible ink, branded as InvisiClues. Meanwhile, Lebling worked on converting the second half of \"Zork\" into \"ZorkII\", but in the process thought up several new puzzles for the game. Although as late as December 1980 he told \"Byte\" that it would be a two-part game, it soon became clear that the second half would not fit into the allotted space. As a result, the game was split again into \"ZorkII: The Wizard of Frobozz\" and \"ZorkIII: The Dungeon Master\". According to Lebling, splitting the game into episodes led to different atmospheres: \"ZorkI\" was focused on exploration and \"Adventure\"-style gameplay, \"II\" had more of a focus on plot and added magic spells to the base game, and \"III\" was less straightforward, with time-sensitive aspects. Marc Blank constructed \"ZorkIII\" and added gameplay changes such as the modified point system to move the game away from straightforward dungeon exploration.\n\"Zork II\" was offered to Personal Software in April 1981 and the contract was signed in June, but Infocom grew wary of continuing this relationship. The Infocom team felt that Personal Software was not advertising \"ZorkI\" very strongly, and did not seem excited about Infocom's plans for \"ZorkIII\" and other planned text adventure games such as \"Deadline\" and \"Starcross\". Personal Software soon stopped publishing entertainment software altogether and rebranded as VisiCorp in 1982 to align with its VisiCalc spreadsheet software. Rather than find another publisher, Infocom decided to self-publish its games and began renting office space and contracting with production facilities. It bought out Personal Software's stock of AppleII \"ZorkI\" copies and began publishing \"ZorkI\" and \"II\" directly by the end of 1981. \"ZorkIII\" followed in the fall of 1982. Infocom developed interpreters for the Commodore 64, Atari 8-bit computers, CP/M systems, and IBM PC compatibles, and released the episodes of \"Zork\" for them as well in 1982.\nReception.\nSales.\nFollowing its 1980 release, \"ZorkI\" became a bestseller from 1982 through 1985, with 380,000 copies sold by 1986. In its first nine months Personal Software sold 7,500 copies for the TRS-80 and AppleII. Sales ballooned as Infocom began self-publishing the trilogy and the personal computer market expanded. \"ZorkI\" had sold 38,000 copies by the end of 1982, nearly 100,000 in 1983, and around 150,000 copies in 1984. Its success outpaced Infocom's later games; \"Inc.\" reported in 1983 that \"ZorkI\", only one of Infocom's fifteen released titles, composed twenty percent of their annual sales. \"ZorkI\" sales declined beginning in 1985. The second and third parts of \"Zork\" also sold well, though not as highly as the first: more than 170,000 \"ZorkII\" and 130,000 \"ZorkIII\" copies sold by 1986.\nOverall sales of the first three episodes reached over 760,000 copies by early 1989. Combined, they sold more than 250,000 copies by 1984, and more than 680,000 copies through 1986, including the 1986 \"Zork Trilogy\" compilation release. Between 1982 and 1986, the \"Zork\" trilogy composed more than one-third of Infocom's two million total game sales. Activision purchased Infocom in 1986 and reported that the three \"Zork\" games and trilogy compilation sold another 80,000 copies by early 1989.\nReviews.\nThe episodes of \"Zork\" were highly praised in contemporaneous reviews. \"Byte\" and \"80 Micro\" praised their writing, which the \"Byte\" reviewer described as \"entertaining, eloquent, witty, and precise\". Reviewers for \"Softalk\" and \"The Space Gamer\" enjoyed how the parser let them input more complex sentences than did earlier games, the \"Softalk\" review noting that every other game since \"Adventure\" had limited the player to two-word phrases, though they also thought players would largely stick with clearer two-word commands. \"80 Micro\" wondered whether \"Zork\" could ever be completed because of how much the parser let the player do. \"Byte\" concluded that \"no single advance in the science of \"Adventure\" has been as bold and exciting\" as \"Zork\", a sentiment echoed by \"Softalk\".\nIn the years after its release, \"ZorkI\" received more reviews praising the game in relation to \"Adventure\" and the genre. Jerry Pournelle described the mainframe and Personal Software versions as \"more difficult and more interesting\" than \"Adventure\" in 1980, and recommended the Infocom version in 1983, saying that \"if you liked \"Adventure\" and wanted more... I guarantee you'll love \"Zork\"\". \"Computer Gaming World\" in 1982, \"PC Magazine\" in 1982, and \"SoftSide\" in 1983 all recommended it as a \"must-have\" for anyone interested in fantasy or adventure games. \"Family Computing\", in late 1983, proclaimed it a classic of the genre and the game that made the adventure genre more than a novelty.\nReviewers similarly praised \"Zork\"'s second and third episodes. \"Softline\" recommended \"ZorkII\" for its \"well-balanced mix of humor, wit, and wry puns\" for both new and experienced players. \"PC Magazine\" said it would appeal to all players and that the game was challenging, enjoyable, and funny. A reviewer for \"Softalk\" said it broke away from both the first episode and \"Adventure\" to be \"fresh and interesting\". Some of the puzzles in \"ZorkII\" were later considered \"infamously difficult\", and in a hint book, Infocom apologized for one puzzle's difficulty and reliance on baseball knowledge. Reviews in \"Softalk\" and \"Creative Computing\" named \"ZorkIII\" as the best in the trilogy. \"PC World\" said it was \"just as exciting and puzzling as \"ZorkI\" and \"II\"\", though its puzzles could be frustrating. A review in \"Fantasy Gamer\" called it \"possibly the ultimate in all-text adventure games\".\"K-Power\" concluded that \"ZorkIII\" was \"the most intelligent text game for a microcomputer that we've ever seen\".\n\"Commodore Magazine\", in June 1983, described the combined trilogy as the most popular adventure game, as well as the best. \"The Addison-Wesley Book of Atari Software 1984\" gave all three parts of \"Zork\" an overall A+ rating. It called \"ZorkI\" \"the definitive adventure game\", adding that \"ZorkII\" \"has the same outstanding command flexibility, wry humor, and word recognition of \"Zork\"\", and concluded that \"ZorkIII\" was \"perhaps the most entertaining of the three\" and \"a highwater mark for subtlety and logic\". \"InfoWorld's Essential Guide to Atari Computers\" recommended the trilogy as among the best adventure games for the Atari 8-bit computer.\nLegacy.\n\"Zork\" has been described as \"by far the most famous piece of [interactive fiction]\" and \"the father figure of the genre\". Game historian Matt Barton contended that \"to say that \"Zork\" is an influential adventure game is like saying the Iliad is an influential poem\". Rather than simply influencing games, Barton said it instead showed that the computer could simulate a rich virtual world, and helped lay the foundations of video game concepts around exploring, collecting objects, and overcoming problems. Nick Montfort, in his book on interactive fiction \"Twisty Little Passages: An Approach to Interactive Fiction\" (2003), suggested that \"Zork\"'s legacy and influence lay not in its parser or writing, but in the way it modeled the game world as a complex, dynamic space that the player moved through. Janet Murray, in \"Hamlet on the Holodeck\" (1997), considered this a result of the way the game was programmed compared to other games of the time, with each area, item, and actor modeled as their own object that could act and be acted upon. Historians have argued that \"Zork\", along with \"Colossal Cave Adventure\", influenced the creation of the MUD genre, and through it the more recent massively multiplayer online role-playing game genre.\nThe game's natural language parser has been noted as having a strong personality, and it was one of the first games to have one. It has been cited as starting a strong trend in writing for adventure games having \"metafictional humor, and tendency towards self-parody\". Decades later \"Zork\" is still cited as an inspiration for text interfaces such as chatbots. It has also been used, along with other text adventure games, as a framework for testing natural language processing systems.\n\"Zork\" was listed on several lists of the best video games more than a decade after release. In 1992 \"Computer Gaming World\" added \"Zork\" to its Hall of Fame. It was placed on \"best games of all time\" lists for \"Computer Gaming World\" and \"Next Generation\" in 1996, and \"Next Generation\" listed the entire series as a whole in 1999. In 2016 \"PC Gamer\" ranked \"Zork\" as one of the fifty most important video games ever made for establishing Infocom as a studio and defining an entire generation of adventure games. In 2007 \"Zork\" was listed among the ten \"game canon\" video games selected for preservation by the Library of Congress. In November 2025, Microsoft, which had acquired Activision, released \"Zork I\", \"II\", and \"III\" as open source.\nThe grue has been used as a homage to classic, early computer gaming, referenced in games such as \"NetHack\", \"World of Warcraft\", and \"Alan Wake\". A reference to grues is also made in title and refrain of Nerdcore rapper MC Frontalot's song \"It Is Pitch Dark\". Writer Bernard Perron, while discussing horror in video games, stated that being hunted by a grue was a \"terrifying situation no player had ever experienced before\". \"IGN\" regarded the grue as one of the best video game villains, stating that the dialogue \"It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue\" was effective, and how despite some physical characteristics being made clear later, players have their own \"utterly personal mental image of what a grue looks like\". They noted that while it started as a solution to a game problem, it had evolved to become \"one of the chief boogiemen in the early history of video games\".\nLater games and media.\n\"Zork\" was the centerpiece of Infocom's game catalog, and Infocom quickly followed it with several more text adventure games using variants of the \"Zork\" codebase and the Z-machine, each of which sold tens of thousands of copies. By 1984, three years after Infocom began self-publishing \"Zork I\", Infocom had fifty full-time employees, US$6million in annual sales, and twelve other games released. Infocom internally nicknamed its early games in relation to \"Zork\", such as \"Zork: the Mystery\" (\"Deadline\", 1982), \"Zorks in Space\" (\"Starcross\", 1982), and \"Zork IV\" (\"Enchanter\", 1983). By 1986 this had increased to 26 total titles. Although \"Wishbringer: The Magick Stone of Dreams\" (1985) was ostensibly set in the same world as \"Zork\", the company had not made any more official \"Zork\" games, releasing only a \"Zork Trilogy\" compilation of all three episodes.\nIn 1985 Infocom diversified into professional software by creating a relational database product called Cornerstone. Poor sales led to financial difficulties and the company was sold to Activision in 1986. Infocom then created two more \"Zork\" games: \"Beyond Zork: The Coconut of Quendor\" (1987), which added a graphical map and more role-playing and combat elements, and \"Zork Zero: The Revenge of Megaboz\" (1988), a prequel game that added graphical elements and menus as well as graphical minigames. Infocom's tenure under Activision was rocky, and rising costs and falling profits, exacerbated by a lack of new products in 1988, led Activision to close Infocom in 1989.\nActivision returned to the series with several graphic adventure games: \"Return to Zork\" (1993), \"Zork Nemesis: The Forbidden Lands\" (1996), and ' (1997). It also released ' (1997), a free text adventure game partially written by original Infocom implementers Michael Berlyn and Marc Blank to promote \"Zork: Grand Inquisitor\". In 2009 Jolt Online Gaming released \"Legends of Zork\", a freemium browser-based online adventure game.\nThe original \"Zork\" games have been re-released in several compilations since \"Zork Trilogy\". They are included in \"The Lost Treasures of Infocom\" (1991), \"Zork Anthology\" (1994), \"Classic Text Adventure Masterpieces of Infocom\" (1996), and \"Zork Legacy Collection\" (1996). A graphical port of \"ZorkI\" for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn consoles was produced by Sh\u014deisha in Japan in 1996, nineteen years after its original release. Unofficial versions of \"Zork\" have been created for over forty years for a wide range of systems, such as browsers or smart speakers.\nFour gamebooks, written by Infocom developer Steve Meretzky and set in the \"Zork\" world, were published in 1983\u20131984: \"The Forces of Krill\" (1983), \"The Malifestro Quest\" (1983), \"The Cavern of Doom\" (1983), and \"Conquest at Quendor\" (1984). These books, known collectively as the \"\"Zork\" books\", are presented as interactive fiction in the style of the \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" series, wherein the player makes periodic choices and turns to a page that corresponds to that choice. Two novels were published based on the original game: \"The Zork Chronicles\" by George Alec Effinger (1990) and \"The Lost City of Zork\" by Robin Wayne Bailey (1991). In 1996 Threshold Entertainment acquired the rights to \"Zork\" and announced plans to create a \"Zork\" movie and live action TV series, though it was never produced.\nReferences.\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
