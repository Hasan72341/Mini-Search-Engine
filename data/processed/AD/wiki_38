It was released to manufacturing on August 24, 2001, and later to retail on October 25, 2001. It is a direct successor to Windows 2000 for high-end and business users and Windows Me for home users.\nDevelopment of Windows XP began in the late 1990s under the codename \"Neptune\", built on the Windows NT kernel and explicitly intended for mainstream consumer use. An updated version of Windows 2000 was also initially planned for the business market. However, in January 2000, both projects were scrapped in favor of a single OS codenamed \"Whistler\", which would serve as a single platform for both consumer and business markets. As a result, Windows XP is the first consumer edition of Windows not based on the Windows 95 kernel or MS-DOS.\nUpon its release, Windows XP received critical acclaim, noting increased performance and stability (especially compared to Windows Me), a more intuitive user interface, improved hardware support and expanded multimedia capabilities. Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 were succeeded by Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, released in 2007 and 2008, respectively. \nMainstream support for Windows XP ended on April 14, 2009, and extended support ended on April 8, 2014. Windows Embedded POSReady 2009, based on Windows XP Professional, received security updates until April 2019. The final security update for Service Pack 3 was released on May 14, 2019. Unofficial methods were made available to apply the updates to other editions of Windows XP. Microsoft has discouraged this practice, citing compatibility issues.\nAs of 2025[ [update]], globally, 0.4% of Windows PCs and 0.1% of all devices across all platforms continue to run Windows\u00a0XP.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDevelopment.\nIn the late 1990s, initial development of what would become Windows XP was focused on two individual products: \"Odyssey\", which was reportedly intended to succeed the future Windows 2000 and \"Neptune\", which was reportedly a consumer-oriented operating system using the Windows NT architecture, succeeding the MS-DOS-based Windows 98.\nHowever, the projects proved to be too ambitious. In January 2000, shortly prior to the official release of Windows 2000, technology writer Paul Thurrott reported that Microsoft had shelved both Neptune and Odyssey in favor of a new product codenamed \"Whistler\", named after Whistler, British Columbia, as many Microsoft employees skied at the Whistler-Blackcomb ski resort. The goal of Whistler was to unify both the consumer and business-oriented Windows lines under a single, Windows NT platform. Thurrott stated that Neptune had become \"a black hole when all the features that were cut from Windows Me were simply re-tagged as Neptune features. And since Neptune and Odyssey would be based on the same code-base anyway, it made sense to combine them into a single project\".\nAt PDC on July 13, 2000, Microsoft announced that Whistler would be released during the second half of 2001, and also unveiled the first preview build, 2250, which featured an early implementation of Windows XP's visual styles system and interface changes to Windows Explorer and the Control Panel.\nMicrosoft released the first public beta build of Whistler, build 2296, on October 31, 2000. Subsequent builds gradually introduced features that users of the release version of Windows XP would recognize, such as Internet Explorer 6.0, the Microsoft Product Activation system, and the \"Bliss\" desktop background.\nWhistler was officially unveiled during a media event on February 5, 2001, under the name Windows XP, where XP stands for \"eXPerience\".\nRelease.\nIn June 2001, Microsoft indicated that it was planning to spend at least US$1\u00a0billion on marketing and promoting Windows XP, in conjunction with Intel and other PC makers. The theme of the campaign, \"Yes You Can\", was designed to emphasize the platform's overall capabilities. Microsoft had originally planned to use the slogan \"Prepare to Fly\", but it was replaced because of sensitivity issues in the wake of the September 11 attacks.\nOn August 24, 2001, Windows XP build 2600 was released to manufacturing (RTM). During a ceremonial media event at Microsoft Redmond Campus, copies of the RTM build were given to representatives of several major PC manufacturers in briefcases, who then flew off on decorated helicopters. While PC manufacturers would be able to release devices running XP beginning on September 24, 2001, XP was expected to reach general retail availability on October 25, 2001. On the same day, Microsoft also announced the final retail pricing of XP's two main editions, \"Home\" (as a replacement for Windows Me for home computing) and \"Professional\" (as a replacement for Windows 2000 for high-end users).\nNew and updated features.\nUser interface.\nWhile retaining some similarities to previous versions, Windows XP's interface was overhauled with a new visual appearance, with an increased use of alpha compositing effects, drop shadows, and \"visual styles\", which completely changed the appearance of the operating system. The number of effects enabled are determined by the operating system based on the computer's processing power, and can be enabled or disabled on a case-by-case basis. XP also added ClearType, a new subpixel rendering system designed to improve the appearance of fonts on liquid-crystal displays. A new set of system icons was also introduced. The default wallpaper, \"Bliss\", is a photo of a landscape in the Napa Valley outside Napa, California, with rolling green hills and a blue sky with stratocumulus and cirrus clouds.\nThe Start menu received its first major overhaul in XP, switching to a two-column layout with the ability to list, pin, and display frequently used applications, recently opened documents, and the traditional cascading \"All Programs\" menu. The taskbar can now group windows opened by a single application into one taskbar button, with a popup menu listing the individual windows. The notification area also hides \"inactive\" icons by default. A \"common tasks\" list was added, and Windows Explorer's sidebar was updated to use a new task-based design with lists of common actions; the tasks displayed are contextually relevant to the type of content in a folder (e.g. a folder with music displays offers to play all the files in the folder, or burn them to a CD).\nFast user switching allows additional users to log into a Windows XP machine without existing users having to close their programs and log out. Although only one user at the time can use the console (i.e., monitor, keyboard, and mouse), previous users can resume their session once they regain control of the console. Service Pack 2 and Service Pack 3 also introduced new features to Windows XP post-release, including the Windows Security Center, Bluetooth support, Data Execution Prevention, Windows Firewall, and support for SDHC cards that are larger than 4\u00a0GB and up to 32\u00a0GB.\nInfrastructure.\nWindows XP uses prefetching to improve startup and application launch times. It also became possible to revert the installation of an updated device driver, should the updated driver produce undesirable results.\nA copy protection system known as Windows Product Activation was introduced with Windows XP and its server counterpart, Windows Server 2003. All non-enterprise (Volume Licensing) Windows licenses must be tied to a unique ID generated using information from the computer hardware, transmitted either via the internet or a telephone hotline. If Windows is not activated within 30 days of installation, the OS will cease to function until it is activated. Windows also periodically verifies the hardware to check for changes. If significant hardware changes are detected, the activation is voided, and Windows must be re-activated.\nNetworking and internet functionality.\nWindows XP was originally bundled with Internet Explorer 6, Outlook Express 6, Windows Messenger, and MSN Explorer. New networking features were also added, including Internet Connection Firewall, Internet Connection Sharing integration with UPnP, NAT traversal APIs, Quality of Service features, IPv6 and Teredo tunneling, Background Intelligent Transfer Service, extended fax features, network bridging, peer to peer networking, support for most DSL modems, IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) connections with auto configuration and roaming, TAPI 3.1, and networking over FireWire. Remote Assistance and Remote Desktop were also added, which allow users to connect to a computer running Windows XP from across a network or the Internet and access their applications, files, printers, and devices or request help. Improvements were also made to \"IntelliMirror\" features such as Offline Files, roaming user profiles, and folder redirection.\nBackward compatibility.\nTo enable running software that targets or locks out specific versions of Windows, \"Compatibility mode\" was added. It allows pretending a selected earlier version of Windows to software, starting at Windows 95. This feature was first introduced in Windows 2000 Service Pack 2, released five months before the release of Windows XP, and was backported from prerelease Windows XP builds. Unlike with Windows XP, however, it was hidden from the operating system as it was not enabled by default and had to be manually activated through the Register Server utility. It was also only available to administrator users. Windows XP has this feature activated out of the box and also grants it to regular users.\nRemoved features.\nSome of the programs and features that were part of the previous versions of Windows did not make it to Windows XP. Various MS-DOS commands available in its Windows 9x predecessor were removed, as were the POSIX and OS/2 subsystems.\nIn networking, NetBEUI, NWLink and NetDDE were deprecated and not installed by default. Plug-and-play\u2013incompatible communication devices (like modems and network interface cards) were no longer supported.\nLater service packs from Service Pack 2 onwards would gradually remove features from Windows XP, such as support for TCP half-open connections, Program Manager and the \"Address bar\" toolbar option on the taskbar. The boot screens for all editions of Windows XP have also been unified by Service Pack 2 onwards, where the blue progress bar is used for all editions including Home Edition (which previously used a green progress bar in Service Pack 1 and prior) and the SKU and copyright years on the boot screen were removed.\nEditions.\nWindows XP was released in two major editions on launch: \"Home Edition\" and \"Professional Edition\". Both editions were made available at retail as pre-loaded software on new computers and as boxed copies. Boxed copies were sold as \"Upgrade\" or \"Full\" licenses; the \"Upgrade\" versions were slightly cheaper, but require an existing version of Windows to install. The \"Full\" version can be installed on systems without an operating system or existing version of Windows. The two editions of XP were aimed at different markets: \"Home Edition\" is explicitly intended for consumer use and disables or removes certain advanced and enterprise-oriented features present on \"Professional\", such as the ability to join a Windows domain, Internet Information Services, and Multilingual User Interface. Windows 98 or Me can be upgraded to either \"Home Edition\" or \"Professional\" and Windows NT 4.0 or 2000 can only be upgraded to \"Professional\". Windows' software license agreement for pre-loaded licenses allows the software to be \"returned\" to the OEM for a refund if the user does not wish to use it. Despite the refusal of some manufacturers to honor the entitlement, it has been enforced by courts in some countries.\nTwo specialized variants of XP were introduced in 2002 for certain types of hardware, exclusively through OEM channels as pre-loaded software. \"Windows XP Media Center Edition\" was initially designed for high-end home theater PCs with TV tuners (marketed under the term \"Media Center PC\"), offering expanded multimedia functionality, an electronic program guide, and digital video recorder (DVR) support through the Windows Media Center application. Microsoft also unveiled \"Windows XP Tablet PC Edition\", which contains additional pen input features, and is optimized for mobile devices meeting its Tablet PC specifications. Two different 64-bit editions of XP were made available. The first, \"Windows XP 64-Bit Edition\", was intended for IA-64 (Itanium) systems; as IA-64 usage declined on workstations in favor of AMD's x86-64 architecture, the Itanium edition was discontinued in January 2005. A new 64-bit edition supporting the x86-64 architecture, called \"Windows XP Professional x64 Edition\", was released in April 2005.\nMicrosoft also targeted emerging markets with the 2004 introduction of \"Windows XP Starter Edition\", a special variant of \"Home Edition\" intended for low-cost PCs. The OS is primarily aimed at first-time computer owners, containing heavy localization (including wallpapers and screen savers incorporating images of local landmarks), and a \"My Support\" area which contains video tutorials on basic computing tasks. It also removes certain \"complex\" features, and does not allow users to run more than three applications at a time. After a pilot program in India and Thailand, \"Starter\" was released in other emerging markets throughout 2005. In 2006, Microsoft also unveiled the FlexGo initiative, which would also target emerging markets with subsidized PCs on a pre-paid, subscription basis.\nAs a result of unfair competition lawsuits in Europe and South Korea, which both alleged that Microsoft had improperly leveraged its status in the PC market to favor its own bundled software, Microsoft was ordered to release special editions of XP in these markets that excluded certain applications. In March 2004, after the European Commission fined Microsoft \u20ac497\u00a0million (US$603\u00a0million), Microsoft was ordered to release \"N\" editions of XP that excluded Windows Media Player, encouraging users to pick and download their own media player software. As it was sold at the same price as the edition with Windows Media Player included, certain OEMs (such as Dell, who offered it for a short period, along with Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo and Fujitsu Siemens) chose not to offer it. Consumer interest was minuscule, with roughly 1,500 units shipped to OEMs, and no reported sales to consumers. In December 2005, the Korean Fair Trade Commission ordered Microsoft to make available editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 that do not contain Windows Media Player or Windows Messenger. The \"K\" and \"KN\" editions of Windows XP were released in August 2006, and are only available in English and Korean, and also contain links to third-party instant messenger and media player software.\nService packs.\nA service pack is a cumulative update package that is a superset of all updates, and even service packs, that have been released before it. Three service packs have been released for Windows XP. Service Pack 3 is slightly different, in that it needs at least Service Pack 1 to have been installed, in order to update a live OS. However, Service Pack 3 can still be embedded into a Windows installation disc; SP1 is not reported as a prerequisite for doing so.\nService Pack 1.\nService Pack 1 (SP1) for Windows XP was released on September 9, 2002. It contained over 300 minor, post-RTM bug fixes, along with all security patches released since the original release of XP. SP1 also added USB 2.0 support, the Microsoft Java Virtual Machine, .NET Framework support, and support for technologies used by the then-upcoming \"Media Center\" and \"Tablet PC\" editions of XP. The most significant change on SP1 was the addition of \"Set Program Access and Defaults\", a settings page which allows programs to be set as default for certain types of activities (such as media players or web browsers) and for access to bundled, Microsoft programs (such as Internet Explorer or Windows Media Player) to be disabled. This feature was added to comply with the settlement of \"United States v. Microsoft Corp.\", which required Microsoft to offer the ability for OEMs to bundle third-party competitors to software it bundles with Windows (such as Internet Explorer and Windows Media Player), and give them the same level of prominence as those normally bundled with the OS.\nOn February 3, 2003, Microsoft released Service Pack 1a (SP1a). It was the same as SP1, except the Microsoft Java Virtual Machine was excluded.\nWindows XP Service Pack 1 was later included in Windows XP Tablet PC Edition and Windows XP Media Center Edition.\nService Pack 2.\nService Pack 2 (SP2) for Windows XP Home edition and Professional edition was released on August 25, 2004. Headline features included WPA encryption compatibility for Wi-Fi and usability improvements to the Wi-Fi networking user interface, partial Bluetooth support, and various improvements to security systems.\nHeaded by former computer hacker Window Snyder, the service pack's security improvements (codenamed \"Springboard\", as these features were intended to underpin additional changes in Longhorn) included a major revision to the included firewall (renamed Windows Firewall, and now enabled by default), and an update to Data Execution Prevention, which gained hardware support in the NX bit that can stop some forms of buffer overflow attacks. Raw socket support is removed (which supposedly limits the damage done by zombie machines) and the Windows Messenger service (which had been abused to cause pop-up advertisements to be displayed as system messages without a web browser or any additional software) became disabled by default. Additionally, security-related improvements were made to e-mail and web browsing. Service Pack 2 also added Security Center, an interface that provides a general overview of the system's security status, including the state of the firewall and automatic updates. Third-party firewall and antivirus software can also be monitored from Security Center.\nIn August 2006, Microsoft released updated installation media for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 SP2 (SP2b), in order to incorporate a patch requiring ActiveX controls in Internet Explorer to be manually activated before a user may interact with them. This was done so that the browser would not violate a patent owned by Eolas. Microsoft has since licensed the patent, and released a patch reverting the change in April 2008. In September 2007, another minor revision known as SP2c was released for XP Professional, extending the number of available product keys for the operating system to \"support the continued availability of Windows XP Professional through the scheduled system builder channel end-of-life (EOL) date of January 31, 2009.\"\nWindows XP Service Pack 2 was later included in Windows XP Starter Edition, Windows XP Tablet PC Edition 2005, Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005, Windows Embedded for Point of Service and Windows Fundamentals for Legacy PCs.\nService Pack 3.\nThe third and final Service Pack, SP3, was released through different channels between April 29 and June 10, 2008, about a year after the release of Windows Vista, and about a year before the release of Windows 7. Service Pack 3 was not available for Windows XP x64 Edition, which was based on the Windows Server 2003 kernel and, as a result, used its service packs rather than the ones for the other editions.\nIt began being automatically pushed out to \"Automatic Updates\" users on July 10, 2008. A feature set overview which detailed new features available separately as stand-alone updates to Windows XP, as well as backported features from Windows Vista, was posted by Microsoft. A total of 1,174 fixes are included in SP3. Service Pack 3 could be installed on systems with Internet Explorer up to and including version 8; Internet Explorer 7 was not included as part of SP3. It also did not include Internet Explorer 8, which was included in Windows 7, which was released one year after XP SP3.\nService Pack 3 included security enhancements from those of SP2, including APIs allowing developers to enable Data Execution Prevention for their code, independent of system-wide compatibility enforcement settings, the Security Support Provider Interface, improvements to WPA2 security, and an updated version of the Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider Module that is FIPS 140-2 certified.\nIn incorporating all previously released updates not included in SP2, Service Pack 3 included many other key features. Windows Imaging Component allowed camera vendors to integrate their own proprietary image codecs with the operating system's features, such as thumbnails and slideshows. In enterprise features, Remote Desktop Protocol 6.1 included support for ClearType and 32-bit color depth over RDP, while improvements made to Windows Management Instrumentation in Windows Vista to reduce the possibility of corruption of the WMI repository were backported to XP SP3.\nIn addition, SP3 contains updates to the operating system components of Windows XP Media Center Edition (MCE) and Windows XP Tablet PC Edition, and security updates for .NET Framework version 1.0, which is included in these editions. However, it does not include update rollups for the Windows Media Center application in Windows XP MCE 2005. SP3 also omits security updates for Windows Media Player 10, although the player is included in Windows XP MCE 2005. The Address Bar DeskBand on the Taskbar is no longer included because of antitrust violation concerns.\nUnofficial SP3 ZIP download packages were released on a now-defunct website called The Hotfix from 2005 to 2007. The owner of the website, Ethan C. Allen, was a former Microsoft employee in Software Quality Assurance and would comb through the Microsoft Knowledge Base articles daily and download new hotfixes Microsoft would put online within the articles. The articles would have a \"kbwinxppresp3fix\" and/or \"kbwinxpsp3fix\" tag, thus allowing Allen to easily find and determine which fixes were planned for the official SP3 release to come. Microsoft publicly stated at the time that the SP3 pack was unofficial and advised users to not install it. Allen also released a Vista SP1 package in 2007, for which Allen received a cease-and-desist email from Microsoft.\nWindows XP Service Pack 3 was later included in Windows Embedded Standard 2009 and Windows Embedded POSReady 2009.\nSystem requirements.\nSystem requirements for Windows XP are as follows:\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPhysical memory limits.\nThe maximum amount of RAM that Windows XP can support varies depending on the product edition and the processor architecture. All 32-bit editions of XP support up to 4\u00a0GB, except the Windows XP Starter edition, which supports up to 512\u00a0MB of RAM. The 64-bit editions support up to 128\u00a0GB.\nProcessor limits.\nMaximum number of physical processors that Windows XP supports is: 1 for Starter Edition, Home Edition, Media Center Edition, and Tablet PC Edition; and 2 for Professional.\nMaximum number of logical processors that Windows XP supports is: 32 for 32-bit (x86-32) and 64 for 64-bit (x86-64).\nUpgradeability.\nSeveral Windows XP components are upgradable to the latest versions, which include new versions introduced in later versions of Windows, and other major Microsoft applications are available. These latest versions for Windows XP include:\nSupport lifecycle.\nSupport for the original release of Windows XP (without a service pack) ended on August 30, 2005. Both Windows XP Service Pack 1 and 1a were retired on October 10, 2006, and both Windows 2000 and Windows XP SP2 reached their end of support on July 13, 2010, about 24 months after the launch of Windows XP Service Pack 3. The company stopped general licensing of Windows XP to OEMs and terminated retail sales of the operating system on June 30, 2008, 17 months after the release of Windows Vista. However, an exception was announced on April 3, 2008, for OEMs producing what it defined as \"ultra low-cost personal computers\", particularly netbooks, until one year after the availability of Windows 7 on October 22, 2009. Analysts felt that the move was primarily intended to compete against Linux-based netbooks, although Microsoft's Kevin Hutz stated that the decision was due to apparent market demand for low-end computers with Windows.\nVariants of Windows XP for embedded systems have different support policies: Windows XP Embedded SP3 and Windows Embedded for Point of Service SP3 were supported until January and April 2016, respectively. Windows Embedded Standard 2009, which was succeeded by Windows Embedded Standard 7, and Windows Embedded POSReady 2009, which was succeeded by Windows Embedded POSReady 7, were supported until January and April 2019, respectively. These updates, while intended for the embedded editions, could also be downloaded on standard Windows XP with a registry hack, which enabled unofficial patches until April 2019. However, Microsoft advised Windows XP users against installing these fixes, citing compatibility issues.\nEnd of support.\nOn April 14, 2009, the main Windows XP exited mainstream support and entered the extended support phase; Microsoft continued to provide security updates every month for Windows XP, however, free technical support, warranty claims, and design changes were no longer being offered. Extended support for the main version ended on April 8, 2014, over 12 years after the release of Windows XP; normally Microsoft products have a support life cycle of only 10 years. Beyond the final security updates released on April 8 for the main version, no more security patches or support information are provided for XP free-of-charge; \"critical patches\" will still be created, and made available only to customers subscribing to a paid \"Custom Support\" plan. As it is a Windows component, all versions of Internet Explorer for Windows XP also became unsupported.\nIn January 2014, it was estimated that more than 95% of the 3 million automated teller machines in the world were still running Windows XP (which largely replaced IBM's OS/2 as the predominant operating system on ATMs); ATMs have an average lifecycle of between seven and ten years, but some have had lifecycles as long as 15. Plans were being made by several ATM vendors and their customers to migrate to Windows 7-based systems over the course of 2014, while vendors have also considered the possibility of using Linux-based platforms in the future to give them more flexibility for support lifecycles, and the ATM Industry Association (ATMIA) has since endorsed Windows 10 as a further replacement. However, ATMs typically run the embedded variant of Windows XP, which was supported through January 2016. As of May 2017, around 60% of the 220,000 ATMs in India still run Windows XP.\nFurthermore, at least 49% of all computers in China still ran XP at the beginning of 2014. These holdouts were influenced by several factors; prices of genuine copies of later versions of Windows in the country are high, while Ni Guangnan of the Chinese Academy of Sciences warned that Windows 8 could allegedly expose users to surveillance by the United States government, and the Chinese government banned the purchase of Windows 8 products for government use in May 2014 in protest of Microsoft's inability to provide \"guaranteed\" support. The government also had concerns that the impending end of support could affect their anti-piracy initiatives with Microsoft, as users would simply pirate newer versions rather than purchasing them legally. As such, government officials formally requested that Microsoft extend the support period for XP for these reasons. While Microsoft did not comply with their requests, a number of major Chinese software developers, such as Lenovo, Kingsoft and Tencent, will provide free support and resources for Chinese users migrating from XP. Several governments, in particular those of the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, elected to negotiate \"Custom Support\" plans with Microsoft for their continued, internal use of Windows XP; the British government's deal lasted for a year, and also covered support for Office 2003 (which reached end-of-life the same day) and cost \u00a35.5\u00a0million.\nOn March 8, 2014, Microsoft deployed an update for XP that, on the 8th of each month, displays a pop-up notification to remind users about the end of support; however, these notifications may be disabled by the user. Microsoft also partnered with Laplink to provide a special \"express\" version of its PCmover software to help users migrate files and settings from XP to a computer with a newer version of Windows.\nDespite the approaching end of support of the main version, there were still notable holdouts that had not migrated past XP; many users elected to remain on XP because of the poor reception of Windows Vista, sales of newer PCs with newer versions of Windows declined because of the Great Recession and the effects of Vista, and deployments of new versions of Windows in enterprise environments require a large amount of planning, which includes testing applications for compatibility (especially those that are dependent on Internet Explorer 6, which is not compatible with newer versions of Windows). Major security software vendors (including Microsoft itself) planned to continue offering support and definitions for Windows XP past the end of support to varying extents, along with the developers of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Opera web browsers; despite these measures, critics similarly argued that users should eventually migrate from XP to a supported platform.\nThe United States' Computer Emergency Readiness Team released an alert in March 2014 advising users of the impending end of support, and informing them that using XP after April 8 may prevent them from meeting US government information security requirements.\nMicrosoft continued to provide Security Essentials virus definitions and updates for its Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT) for XP until July 14, 2015. As the end of extended support approached, Microsoft began to increasingly urge XP customers to migrate to newer versions such as Windows 7 or 8 in the interest of security, suggesting that attackers could reverse engineer security patches for newer versions of Windows and use them to target equivalent vulnerabilities in XP. Windows XP is remotely exploitable by numerous security holes that were discovered after Microsoft stopped supporting it.\nSimilarly, specialized devices that run XP, particularly medical devices, must have any revisions to their software\u2014even security updates for the underlying operating system\u2014approved by relevant regulators before they can be released. For this reason, manufacturers often did not allow any updates to devices' operating systems, leaving them open to security exploits and malware.\nDespite the end of support of the main version, Microsoft has released three emergency security updates for the operating system to patch major security vulnerabilities:\nResearchers reported in August 2019 that Windows 10 users may be at risk for \"critical\" system compromise because of design flaws of hardware device drivers from multiple providers. In the same month, computer experts reported that the BlueKeep security vulnerability, CVE-, that potentially affects older unpatched Microsoft Windows versions via the program's Remote Desktop Protocol, allowing for the possibility of remote code execution, may now include related flaws, collectively named \"DejaBlue\", affecting newer Windows versions (i.e., Windows 7 and all recent versions) as well. In addition, experts reported a Microsoft security vulnerability, CVE-, based on legacy code involving Microsoft CTF and ctfmon (ctfmon.exe), that affects all Windows versions from the older Windows XP version to the most recent Windows 10 versions; a patch to correct the flaw is currently available.\nMicrosoft announced in July 2019 that the Microsoft Internet Games services on Windows XP and Windows Me would end on July 31, 2019 (and for Windows 7 on January 22, 2020).\nIn 2020, Microsoft announced that it would disable the Windows Update service for SHA-1 endpoints for older Windows versions. Since Windows XP did not get an update for SHA-2, Windows Update Services are no longer available on the OS as of late July 2020. As of March 2024, many of the old updates for Windows XP are available on the Microsoft Update Catalog. A third-party tool named Legacy Update allows previously released updates for Windows XP to be installed from the Update Catalog.\nThird-party support.\nIn February 2016, Opera announced that version 36 of its web browser would be the last version of the web browser to support Windows XP and Windows Vista. Google Chrome ended support for Windows XP and Windows Vista in April 2016. Firefox 52 ESR (Extended Support Release), which was released in March 2017, was the last version to support Windows XP and Windows Vista. Support for Firefox 52 ESR ended in June 2018.\nBlizzard Entertainment ended support for \"World of Warcraft\", \"StarCraft II\", \"Diablo III\", \"Hearthstone\", and \"Heroes of the Storm\" on Windows XP and Vista in October 2017. Steam ended support for Windows XP and Vista on January 1, 2019.\nThere are several unofficial web browser projects that maintain support for Windows XP, well after official web browsers dropped support for the operating system. Supermium, a fork of the Chromium project that Google Chrome is based on, is maintained for Windows XP and later unsupported versions of Windows as of 2024. MyPal, a fork of Firefox 68, is also being actively maintained for Windows XP.\nReception.\nOn release, Windows XP received critical acclaim. CNET described the operating system as being \"worth the hype\", considering the new interface to be \"spiffier\" and more intuitive than previous versions, but feeling that it may \"annoy\" experienced users with its \"hand-holding\". XP's expanded multimedia support and CD burning functionality were also noted, along with its streamlined networking tools. The performance improvements of XP in comparison to 2000 and Me were also praised, along with its increased number of built-in device drivers in comparison to 2000. The software compatibility tools were also praised, although it was noted that some programs, particularly older MS-DOS software, may not work correctly on XP because of its differing architecture. They panned Windows XP's new licensing model and product activation system, considering it to be a \"slightly annoying roadblock\", but acknowledged Microsoft's intent for the changes. \"PC Magazine\" provided similar praise, although noting that a number of its online features were designed to promote Microsoft-owned services, and that aside from quicker boot times, XP's overall performance showed little difference over Windows 2000. Windows XP's default theme, Luna, was criticized by some users for its childish look.\nDespite extended support for the main Windows XP ending in 2014, many users \u2013 including some enterprises \u2013 were reluctant to move away from an operating system they viewed as a stable known quantity despite the many security and functionality improvements in subsequent releases of Windows. Windows XP's longevity was viewed as testament to its stability and Microsoft's successful attempts to keep it up to date, but also as an indictment of its direct successor's perceived failings.\nMarket share.\nAccording to web analytics data generated by Net Applications, Windows XP was the most widely used operating system until August 2012, when Windows 7 overtook it (later overtaken by Windows 10), while StatCounter indicates it happening almost a year earlier. In January 2014, Net Applications reported a market share of 29.23% of \"desktop operating systems\" for XP (when XP was introduced there was not a separate mobile category to track), while W3Schools reported a share of 11.0%.\nAs of \u00a02022[ [update]], in most regions or continents, Windows XP market share on PCs, as a fraction of the total Windows share, had gone below 1% (0.5% in Africa). Windows XP allegedly retains a double-digit market share in a few countries such as Armenia, where 72% of Windows PCs in the country are still using Windows XP .\nSource code leak.\nOn September 23, 2020, source code for Windows XP with Service Pack 1 and Windows Server 2003 was leaked onto the imageboard 4chan by an unknown user. Anonymous users managed to compile the code, as well as a Twitter user who posted videos of the process on YouTube proving that the code was genuine. The videos were later removed on copyright grounds by Microsoft. The leak was incomplete as it was missing Winlogon and some other components. The original leak itself was spread using magnet links and torrent files whose payload originally included Server 2003 and XP source code and which was later updated with additional files, among which were previous leaks of Microsoft products, its patents, media about conspiracy theories on Bill Gates by anti-vaccination movements and an assortment of PDF files on different topics.\nMicrosoft issued a statement stating that it was investigating the leaks.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

There are two main types of woodwind instruments: flutes and reed instruments (otherwise called reed pipes). The main distinction between these instruments and other wind instruments is the way in which they produce sound. All woodwinds produce sound by splitting the air blown into them on a sharp edge, such as a reed or a fipple. Despite the name, a woodwind may be made of any material, not just wood. Common examples of other materials include brass, silver, cane, and other metals such as gold and platinum. The saxophone, for example, though made of brass, is considered a woodwind because it requires a reed to produce sound. Occasionally, woodwinds are made of earthen materials, especially ocarinas.\nFlutes.\nFlutes produce sound by directing a focused stream of air across the edge of a hole in a cylindrical tube. The flute family can be divided into two subfamilies: open flutes and closed flutes.\nTo produce a sound with an open flute, the player is required to blow a stream of air across a sharp edge that then splits the airstream. This split air stream then acts upon the air column contained within the flute's hollow, causing it to vibrate and produce sound. Examples of open flutes are the transverse flute, panpipes, and shakuhachi. Ancient flutes of this variety, including bamboo flutes, were often made from tubular sections of plants such as grasses, reeds, bamboo, and hollowed-out tree branches. Later, flutes were made of metals such as tin, copper, or bronze. Modern concert flutes are usually made of high-grade metal alloys, usually containing nickel, silver, copper, or gold.\nTo produce a sound with a closed flute, the player is required to blow air into a duct. This duct acts as a channel, bringing the air to a sharp edge. As with the open flutes, the air is then split; this causes the column of air within the closed flute to vibrate and produce sound. Examples of this type of flute include the recorder, ocarina, and organ pipes.\nReed instruments.\nReed instruments produce sound by focusing air into a mouthpiece, which then causes a reed (or reeds) to vibrate. Reed pipes are divided into single-reed instruments and double-reed instruments.\nSingle-reed woodwinds produce sound by attaching a reed to the opening of a mouthpiece (using a ligature). When air is forced between the reed and the mouthpiece, the reed causes the air column in the instrument to vibrate and produce its unique sound. Single reed instruments include the clarinet and saxophone.\nDouble reed instruments use two precisely cut, small pieces of cane bound together at the base. This form of sound production has been estimated to have originated in the middle to late Neolithic period; its discovery has been attributed to the observation of wind blowing through a split rush. The finished, bound reed is inserted into the instrument and vibrates as air is forced between the two pieces (again, causing the air within the instrument to vibrate as well). This family of reed pipes is subdivided further into another two subfamilies: exposed double reed, and capped double reed instruments. \nExposed double-reed instruments are played by having the double reed directly between the player's lips. This family includes instruments such as the oboe, cor anglais (also called English horn), and bassoon, and many types of shawms throughout the world.\nCapped double-reed instruments, on the other hand, have the double reed covered by a cap; the player blows through a hole in this cap that then directs the air through the reeds. This family includes the crumhorn.\nBagpipes are unique reed pipe instruments, since they use two or more double or single reeds. However, bagpipes are functionally the same as a capped double reed instruments, since the reeds are never in direct contact with the player's lips.\nFree reed aerophone instruments are likewise unique since sound is produced by 'free reeds' \u2013 small metal tongues arranged in rows within a metal or wooden frame. The airflow necessary for the instrument's sound is generated either by a player's breath (e.g. harmonica), or by bellows (e.g. accordion).\nModern orchestra and concert band woodwinds.\nThe modern orchestra's woodwind section typically includes flutes, oboes, clarinets, and bassoons. Supplementary instruments include piccolo, cor anglais, bass clarinet, E-flat clarinet, and contrabassoon. Saxophones are also used on occasion.\nThe concert band's woodwind section is typically much larger and more diverse than the orchestra's. It typically includes piccolo(s), flutes, oboes, B\u266d clarinets, bass clarinet(s), bassoons, alto saxophones, tenor saxophone(s), and baritone saxophone(s). Alto and bass flutes, cor anglais, E\u266d clarinet, \nalto clarinet or basset horn(s), contra-alto or contrabass clarinet(s), contrabassoon, and soprano and bass saxophones are also sometimes used.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It developed from the system produced by Thomas Francis Wade during the mid-19th century, and was given completed form with Herbert Giles's \"A Chinese\u2013English Dictionary\" (1892).\nThe romanization systems in common use until the late 19th century were based on the Nanjing dialect, but Wade\u2013Giles was based on the Beijing dialect and was the system of transcription familiar in the English-speaking world for most of the 20th century. Both of these kinds of transcription were used in postal romanizations (romanized place-names standardized for postal uses). In mainland China, Wade\u2013Giles has been mostly replaced by Hanyu Pinyin, which was officially adopted in 1958, with exceptions for the romanized forms of some of the most commonly used names of locations and persons, and other proper nouns. The romanized name for most locations, persons and other proper nouns in Taiwan is based on the Wade\u2013Giles derived romanized form, for example Kaohsiung, the Matsu Islands and Chiang Ching-kuo.\nHistory.\nWade\u2013Giles was developed by Thomas Francis Wade, a scholar of Chinese and a British ambassador in China who was the first professor of Chinese at the University of Cambridge. Wade published \"\" () in 1867, the first textbook on the Beijing dialect of Mandarin in English, which became the basis for the system later known as Wade\u2013Giles. The system, designed to transcribe Chinese terms for Chinese specialists, was further refined in 1892 by Herbert Giles (in \"A Chinese\u2013English Dictionary\"), a British diplomat in China, and his son Lionel Giles, a curator at the British Museum.\nTaiwan used Wade\u2013Giles for decades as the de facto standard, co-existing with several official romanizations in succession, namely, Gwoyeu Romatzyh (1928), Mandarin Phonetic Symbols II (1986), and Tongyong Pinyin (2000). Under Ma Ying-jeou's Kuomintang (KMT)-led government, in 2009, Taiwan officially adopted pinyin, and the English romanisations on a number of street signs in cities with then Kuomintang mayors were switched over to conform to this. However, the majority of the people in Taiwan, both resident and overseas, still use spelling and transcribe their legal names based on the Wade\u2013Giles system, as well as the other aforementioned systems.\nInitials and finals.\nThe tables below show the Wade\u2013Giles representation of each Chinese sound (in bold type), together with the corresponding IPA phonetic symbol (in square brackets), and equivalent representations in Bopomofo and Hanyu Pinyin.\nInitials.\nInstead of \"ts\", \"ts\u02bb\" and \"s\", Wade\u2013Giles writes \"tz\", \"tz\u02bb\" and \"ss\" before \"\u016d\" (see below).\nFinals.\nWade\u2013Giles writes \"-uei\" after \"k\u02bb\" and \"k\", otherwise \"-ui\": \"k\u02bbuei\", \"kuei\", \"hui\", \"shui\", \"ch\u02bbui\".\nIt writes as \"-o\" after \"k\u02bb\", \"k\" and \"h\", otherwise as \"-\u00ea\": \"k\u02bbo\", \"ko\", \"ho\", \"sh\u00ea\", \"ch\u02bb\u00ea\". When forms a syllable on its own, it is written \"\u00ea\" or \"o\" depending on the character.\nWade\u2013Giles writes as \"-uo\" after \"k\u02bb\", \"k\", \"h\" and \"sh\", otherwise as \"-o\": \"k\u02bbuo\", \"kuo\", \"huo\", \"shuo\", \"bo\", \"tso\". After \"ch\u02bb\", it is written \"ch\u02bbo\" or \"ch\u02bbuo\" depending on the character.\nFor \"-ih\" and \"-\u016d\", see below.\nGiles's \"A Chinese\u2013English Dictionary\" also includes the finals \"-io\" (in \"yo\", \"chio\", \"ch\u02bbio\", \"hsio\", \"lio\" and \"nio\") and \"-\u00fco\" (in \"ch\u00fco\", \"ch\u02bb\u00fco\", \"hs\u00fco\", \"l\u00fco\" and \"n\u00fco\"), both of which are pronounced \"-\u00fceh\" in modern Standard Chinese: \"y\u00fceh\", \"ch\u00fceh\", \"ch\u02bb\u00fceh\", \"hs\u00fceh\", \"l\u00fceh\" and \"n\u00fceh\".\nSyllables that begin with a medial.\nWade\u2013Giles writes the syllable as \"i\" or \"yi\" depending on the character.\nSystem features.\nConsonants and initial symbols.\nA feature of the Wade\u2013Giles system is the representation of the unaspirated-aspirated stop consonant pairs using a character resembling an apostrophe. Thomas Wade and others used the spiritus asper (\u02bd or \u02bb), borrowed from the polytonic orthography of the Ancient Greek language. Herbert Giles and others used a left (opening) curved single quotation mark (\u2018) for the same purpose. A third group used a plain apostrophe ('). The backtick, and visually similar characters, are sometimes seen in various electronic documents using the system.\nExamples using the spiritus asper: \"p\", \"p\u02bb\", \"t\", \"t\u02bb\", \"k\", \"k\u02bb\", \"ch\", \"ch\u02bb\". The use of this character preserves \"b\", \"d\", \"g\", and \"j\" for the romanization of Chinese varieties containing voiced consonants, such as Shanghainese (which has a full set of voiced consonants) and Min Nan (H\u014d-l\u00f3-o\u0113) whose century-old Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b (POJ, often called Missionary Romanization) is similar to Wade\u2013Giles. POJ, Legge romanization, Simplified Wade, and EFEO Chinese transcription use the letter \u27e8h\u27e9 instead of an apostrophe-like character to indicate aspiration. (This is similar to the obsolete IPA convention before the revisions of the 1970s). The convention of an apostrophe-like character or \u27e8h\u27e9 to denote aspiration is also found in romanizations of other Asian languages, such as McCune\u2013Reischauer for Korean and ISO 11940 for Thai.\nPeople unfamiliar with Wade\u2013Giles often ignore the spiritus asper, sometimes omitting them when copying texts, unaware that they represent vital information. Hanyu Pinyin addresses this issue by employing the Latin letters customarily used for voiced stops, unneeded in Mandarin, to represent the unaspirated stops: \"b, p, d, t, g, k, j, q, zh, ch.\"\nPartly because of the popular omission of apostrophe-like characters, the four sounds represented in Hanyu Pinyin by \"j\", \"q\", \"zh\", and \"ch\" often all become \"ch\", including in many proper names. However, if the apostrophe-like characters are kept, the system reveals a symmetry that leaves no overlap:\nVowels and final symbols.\nSyllabic consonants.\nLike Yale and Mandarin Phonetic Symbols II, Wade\u2013Giles renders the two types of syllabic consonant (; Wade\u2013Giles: \"k\u02bbung1-y\u00fcn4\"; Hanyu Pinyin: \"k\u014dngy\u00f9n\") differently: \nThese finals are both written as \"-ih\" in Tongyong Pinyin, as \"-i\" in Hanyu Pinyin (hence distinguishable only by the initial from as in \"li\"), and as \"-y\" in Gwoyeu Romatzyh and Simplified Wade. They are typically omitted in Bopomofo.\nVowel \"o\".\nFinal \"o\" in Wade\u2013Giles has two pronunciations in modern Peking dialect: and .\nWhat is pronounced in vernacular Peking dialect as a close-mid back unrounded vowel is written usually as \"\u00ea\", but sometimes as \"o\", depending on historical pronunciation (at the time Wade\u2013Giles was developed). Specifically, after velar initials \"k\", \"k\u02bb\" and \"h\" (and a historical \"ng\", which had been dropped by the time Wade\u2013Giles was developed), \"o\" is used; for example, \"\u54e5\" is \"ko1\" (Pinyin \"g\u0113\") and \"\u523b\" is \"k\u02bbo4\" (Pinyin \"k\u00e8\"). In Peking dialect, \"o\" after velars (and what used to be \"ng\") have shifted to , thus they are written as \"ge\", \"ke\", \"he\" and \"e\" in Pinyin. When forms a syllable on its own, Wade\u2013Giles writes \"\u00ea\" or \"o\" depending on the character. In all other circumstances, it writes \"\u00ea\".\nWhat is pronounced in Peking dialect as is usually written as \"o\" in Wade\u2013Giles, except for \"wo\", \"shuo\" (e.g. \"\u8aaa\" \"shuo1\") and the three syllables of \"kuo\", \"k\u02bbuo\", and \"huo\" (as in \u904e, \u970d, etc.), which contrast with \"ko\", \"k\u02bbo\", and \"ho\" that correspond to Pinyin \"ge\", \"ke\", and \"he\". This is because characters like \u7f85, \u591a, etc. (Wade\u2013Giles: \"lo2\", \"to1\"; Pinyin: \"lu\u00f3\", \"du\u014d\") did not originally carry the medial . Peking dialect does not have phonemic contrast between \"o\" and \"-uo\"/\"wo\" (except in interjections when used alone) and a medial is usually inserted in front of \"-o\" to form .\nZhuyin and Pinyin write as \u311b \"-o\" after \u3105 \"b\", \u3106 \"p\", \u3107 \"m\" and \u3108 \"f\", and as \u3128\u311b \"-uo\" after all other initials.\nTones.\nTones are indicated in Wade\u2013Giles using superscript numbers (1\u20134) placed after the syllable. This contrasts with the use of diacritics to represent the tones in Pinyin. For example, the Pinyin \"qi\u00e0n\" (fourth tone) has the Wade\u2013Giles equivalent \"ch\u02bbien4\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPunctuation.\nWade\u2013Giles uses hyphens to separate all syllables within a word (whereas Pinyin separates syllables only in specially defined cases, using hyphens or closing (right) single quotation marks as appropriate).\nIf a syllable is not the first in a word, its first letter is not capitalized, even if it is part of a proper noun. The use of apostrophe-like characters, hyphens, and capitalization is frequently not observed in place names and personal names. For example, the majority of overseas Taiwanese people write their given names like \"Tai Lun\" or \"Tai-Lun\", whereas the Wade\u2013Giles is actually \"Tai-lun\". (See also Chinese names.)\nComparison with other systems.\nChart.\nNote: In Hanyu Pinyin, the so-called neutral tone is written leaving the syllable with no diacritic mark at all. In Tongyong Pinyin, a ring is written over the vowel.\nAdaptations.\nThere are several adaptations of Wade\u2013Giles.\n\"Mathews\".\nThe romanization system used in the 1943 edition of \"Mathews' Chinese\u2013English Dictionary\" differs from Wade\u2013Giles in the following ways:\n\"Shadick\".\nIn Harold Shadick's \"A First Course in Literary Chinese\", the following modifications are made to Wade\u2013Giles:\nThe Chinese phrase \u6587\u8a00\u6587\u5165\u9580 (\"W\u00ean2-yen2 w\u00ean2 ju4-m\u00ean2\") would thus be romanized as \"W\u00e9n-y\u00e9n w\u00e9n j\u00f9-m\u00e9n\".\n\"Anderson\".\nThis adaptation of Wade\u2013Giles by Olov Anderson has several distinctive features, most notably the use of tonal spelling and the replacement of apostrophes with the letter \u27e8h\u27e9. For example, the aspirated consonants \"p\u02bb\", \"t\u02bb\" and \"k\u02bb\" become \"ph\", \"th\" and \"kh\". Tones are marked by appending the silent letters \u27e8v\u27e9, \u27e8x\u27e9 and \u27e8z\u27e9 to a syllable. Additionally, \"\u016d\" is written as \"y\", and circumflexes and \"-h\" are dropped in the final position.\nGallery.\nExamples of Wade\u2013Giles derived English language terminology:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Billed as \"an Aquarian Exposition: 3 Days of Peace &amp; Music\" and alternatively referred to as the Woodstock Rock Festival, it attracted an audience of more than 460,000. Thirty-two acts performed outdoors despite overcast skies and sporadic rain. It was one of the largest music festivals in history and would become the peak musical event to reflect the counterculture of the 1960s.\nThe festival has become widely regarded as a pivotal moment in popular music history, as well as a defining event for the silent and early baby boomer generations. The event's significance was reinforced by a 1970 documentary film, an accompanying , and a song written by Joni Mitchell that became a major hit for both Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young and Matthews Southern Comfort. Musical events bearing the Woodstock name were planned for anniversaries, including the 10th, 20th, 25th, 30th, 40th, and 50th. In 2004, \"Rolling Stone\" magazine listed it as number 19 of the \"50 moments that changed the history of rock and roll\". In 2017, the festival site became listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nPlanning and preparation.\nWoodstock was initiated through the efforts of Michael Lang, Artie Kornfeld, Joel Rosenman, and John P. Roberts. Roberts and Rosenman financed the project. Lang had some experience as a promoter, having co-organized the Miami Pop Festival on the East Coast the previous year, where an estimated 25,000 people attended the two-day event.\nEarly in 1969, Roberts and Rosenman were New York City entrepreneurs who were in the process of building Mediasound, a recording studio complex in Manhattan. Lang and Kornfeld's lawyer, Miles Lourie, who had done legal work on the Mediasound project, suggested that they contact Roberts and Rosenman about financing a similar but much smaller studio, Kornfeld, that Lang hoped to build in Woodstock, New York. Unpersuaded by this Studio-in-the-Woods proposal, Roberts and Rosenman counter-proposed a concert featuring the kind of artists known to frequent the Woodstock area, such as Bob Dylan and the Band. Kornfeld and Lang agreed to the new plan, and Woodstock Ventures was formed in January 1969. The company offices were located in an oddly decorated floor of 47 West 57th Street in Manhattan. Burt Cohen and his design group, Curtain Call Productions, oversaw the psychedelic transformation of the office.\nFrom the start there were differences in approach among the four. Roberts was disciplined and knew what was needed for the venture to succeed, while the laid-back Lang saw Woodstock as a new, \"relaxed\" way of bringing entrepreneurs together. When Lang was unable to find a site for the concert, Roberts and Rosenman, growing increasingly concerned, took to the road and found a venue. Similar differences about financial discipline made Roberts and Rosenman wonder whether to pull the plug or to continue pumping money into the project.\nIn April 1969, Creedence Clearwater Revival became the first act to sign a contract for the event, agreeing to play for $10,000 (equivalent to $ in 2024). The promoters had experienced difficulty in landing big-name groups until Creedence committed to play. Creedence drummer Doug Clifford later commented: \"Once Creedence signed, everyone else jumped in line and all the other big acts came on.\" Given their 12:30\u00a0am start time and omission from the \"Woodstock\" film (at Creedence frontman John Fogerty's insistence), Creedence members have expressed bitterness over their experiences regarding the festival.\nWoodstock was conceived as a profit-making venture. It became a \"free concert\" when circumstances prevented the organizers from installing fences and ticket booths before opening day. Tickets for the three-day event cost US$18 in advance and $24 at the gate (equivalent to about $ and $ today). Ticket sales were limited to record stores in the greater New York City area, or by mail via a post office box at the Radio City Station Post Office located in Midtown Manhattan. Around 186,000 advance tickets were sold. The organizers had anticipated that approximately 50,000 festival-goers would turn up.\nSelection of venue.\nThe original plan was for the festival to take place in the town of Woodstock on a site owned by Alexander Tapooz. After local residents rejected that idea, Lang and Kornfeld thought they had found another possible location at the Winston Farm in Saugerties, New York. But they were mistaken, as the landowner's attorney made clear in a brief meeting with Roberts and Rosenman. Growing alarmed at the lack of progress, Roberts and Rosenman took over the search for a venue, and discovered the Mills Industrial Park () in the town of Wallkill, Orange County, New York, which Woodstock Ventures leased for US$10,000 (equivalent to $ today) in the Spring of 1969. Town officials were assured that no more than 50,000 would attend. Town residents immediately opposed the project. In early July, the Town Board passed a law requiring a permit for any gathering of over 5,000 people. The conditions upon which a permit would be issued made it impossible for the promoters to continue construction at the Wallkill site. Reports of the ban, however, turned out to be a publicity bonanza for the festival.\nIn his 2007 book \"Taking Woodstock\", Elliot Tiber relates that he offered to host the event on his motel grounds, and had a permit for such an event. He claims to have introduced the promoters to dairy farmer Max Yasgur. Lang, however, disputes Tiber's account and says that Tiber introduced him to a realtor, who drove him to Yasgur's farm without Tiber. Sam Yasgur, Max's son, agrees with Lang's account. Yasgur's land formed a natural bowl sloping down to Filippini Pond on the land's north side. The stage would be set up at the bottom of the hill with Filippini Pond forming a backdrop. The pond became a popular skinny dipping destination. Filippini was the only landowner who refused to sign a lease for the use of his property. The organizers again told Bethel authorities that they expected no more than 50,000 people.\nDespite opposition from the residents and signs proclaiming, \"Buy No Milk. Stop Max's Hippy Music Festival\", Bethel Town Attorney Frederick W. V. Schadt, building inspector Donald Clark and Town Supervisor Daniel Amatucci approved the festival permits, although the Bethel Town Board refused to issue the permits formally. Clark was ordered to post stop-work orders. Rosenman recalls meeting Don Clark and discussing with him how unethical it was for him to withhold permits which had already been authorized, and which he had in his pocket. At the end of the meeting, Inspector Clark gave him the permits. The stop work order was lifted, allowing the festival to proceed pending backing by the Department of Health and Agriculture, and removal of all structures by September 1, 1969.\nThe late change in venue did not give the festival organizers enough time to prepare. At a meeting three days before the event, Rosenman was asked by the construction foremen to choose between (a) completing the fencing and ticket booths, without which Roberts and Rosenman would be facing almost certain bankruptcy after the festival, or (b) trying to complete the stage, without which it would be a weekend of half a million concert-goers with no concerts. The next morning, on Wednesday, it became clear that option (a) had disappeared. Overnight, 50,000 \"early birds\" had arrived and had planted themselves in front of the half-finished stage. For the rest of the weekend, concert-goers simply walked on to the site with or without tickets. The festival left Roberts and Rosenman close to financial ruin, but their ownership of the film and recording rights turned their finances around when the Academy Award-winning documentary film \"Woodstock\" was released in March 1970.\nFestival.\nThe influx of people to the rural concert site in Bethel created a huge traffic jam. The town of Bethel did not enforce its codes, fearing chaos as crowds flowed to the site. Radio and television descriptions of the traffic jams eventually discouraged people from setting off to the festival. Arlo Guthrie made an announcement that was included in the film saying that the New York State Thruway was closed, although the director of the Woodstock museum said that this did not happen. To add to the problems and difficulty in dealing with the large crowds, recent rain had created muddy roads and fields. The facilities were not adequate to provide sanitation or first aid for the number of people attending, and hundreds of thousands found themselves in a struggle against bad weather, food shortages and poor sanitation.\nThe event's security was to be handled by a group of 346 off-duty New York City police officers, but the officers were forced to withdraw when they were warned that they were violating regulations against moonlighting. On the morning of Sunday, August 17, New York governor and future vice president Nelson Rockefeller called festival organizer John P. Roberts and told him that he was thinking of ordering 10,000 National Guard troops to the festival site, but Roberts persuaded him not to. Sullivan County declared a state of emergency. During the festival, personnel from nearby Stewart Air Force Base helped to ensure order and air-lifted performers in and out of the site.\nJimi Hendrix was the last to perform at the festival, taking the stage at 8:30 Monday morning after delays caused by the rain. By that point the audience numbers had fallen to about 30,000 from an estimated peak of 450,000. Many left during Hendrix's performance, having waited to catch a glimpse of him. Hendrix and his new band Gypsy Sun and Rainbows were introduced as the Experience, but he corrected this and added: \"You could call us a Band of Gypsies\". They performed a two-hour set, including his psychedelic rendition of the national anthem, which became \"part of the sixties Zeitgeist\" after it was captured in the Woodstock film.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWe were ready to rock out and we waited and waited and finally it was our turn ... there were a half million people asleep. These people were out. It was sort of like a painting of a Dante scene, just bodies from hell, all intertwined and asleep, covered with mud.\nAnd this is the moment I will never forget as long as I live: A quarter mile away in the darkness, on the other edge of this bowl, there was some guy flicking his Bic, and in the night I hear, \"Don't worry about it, John. We're with you.\" I played the rest of the show for that guy.\n \u2014John Fogerty recalling Creedence Clearwater Revival's 12:30 a.m. start time at Woodstock\nThe festival was remarkably peaceful given the number of people and the conditions involved, although there were three recorded fatalities: two drug overdoses and another caused when a tractor ran over a 17-year-old sleeping in a nearby hayfield. Births were claimed to have occurred, one in a car caught in traffic and another in hospital after an airlift by helicopter, but extensive research by a book author could not confirm any births. Several miscarriages were reported (sources range from four to eight) and over the course of the three days there were 742 drug overdoses.\nMax Yasgur, who owned the site, spoke of how nearly half a million people had spent the three days with music and peace on their minds. He stated, \"If we join them, we can turn those adversities that are the problems of America today into a hope for a brighter and more peaceful future\".\nSound.\nSound for the concert was engineered by sound engineer Bill Hanley. \"It worked very well\", he said of the event. \"I built special speaker columns on the hills and had 16 loudspeaker arrays in a square platform going up to the hill on towers. We set it up for 150,000 to 200,000 people. Of course, 500,000 showed up.\" ALTEC designed marine plywood cabinets that weighed half a ton apiece and stood tall, almost deep, and wide. Each of these enclosures carried four JBL D140 loudspeakers. The tweeters consisted of 4\u00d72-Cell &amp; 2\u00d710-Cell Altec Horns. Behind the stage were three transformers providing 2,000 amperes of current to power the amplification setup. For many years this system was collectively referred to as \"the Woodstock Bins\". The live performances were captured on two 8-track Scully recorders in a tractor trailer backstage by Eddie Kramer and Lee Osbourne on 1-inch Scotch recording tape at 15ips (0.38 m/s) then mixed at the Record Plant studio in New York.\nLighting.\nLighting for the concert was engineered by lighting designer and technical director E.H. Beresford \"Chip\" Monck. Monck was hired to plan and build the staging and lighting, ten weeks of work for which he was paid $7,000 (equivalent to $ today). Much of his plan had to be scrapped when the promoters were not allowed to use the original location in Wallkill, New York. The stage roof that was constructed in the shorter time available was not able to support the lighting that had been rented, which wound up sitting unused underneath the stage. The only light on the stage was from spotlights.\nMonck used twelve 1300 Watt Super Trouper follow spots rigged on four towers around the stage. The follow spots weighed each and were operated by spotlight operators who had to climb up on the top of the lighting towers.\nMonck also was drafted just before the concert started as the master of ceremonies when Michael Lang noticed he had forgotten to hire one. He can be heard and seen in recordings of Woodstock making the stage announcements, including requests to \"stay off the towers\" and the warning about the \"brown acid\".\nArtists.\nThirty-two acts performed over the course of the four days:\nMedia coverage.\nVery few reporters from outside the immediate area were on the scene. During the first few days of the festival, national media coverage emphasized the problems. Front-page headlines in the \"Daily News\" read \"Traffic Uptight at Hippiefest\" and \"Hippies Mired in a Sea of Mud\". The \"New York Times\" ran an editorial titled \"Nightmare in the Catskills\", which read in part, \"The dreams of marijuana and rock music that drew 300,000 fans and hippies to the Catskills had little more sanity than the impulses that drive the lemmings to march to their deaths in the sea. They ended in a nightmare of mud and stagnation ... What kind of culture is it that can produce so colossal a mess?\" Coverage became more positive by the end of the festival, in part because the parents of concertgoers called the media and told them, based on their children's phone calls, that their reporting was misleading.\n\"The New York Times\" covered the prelude to the festival and the move from Wallkill to Bethel. Barnard Collier, who reported from the event for \"The New York Times\", asserted that he was pressured by on-duty editors at the paper to write a misleadingly negative article about the event. According to Collier, this led to acrimonious discussions and his threat to refuse to write the article until the paper's executive editor, James Reston, agreed to let him write the article as he saw fit. The eventual article dealt with issues of traffic jams and minor lawbreaking, but went on to emphasize cooperation, generosity, and the good nature of the festival goers. When the festival was over, Collier wrote another article about the exodus of fans from the festival site and the lack of violence at the event. The chief medical officer for the event and several local residents were quoted as praising the festival goers.\nMiddletown, New York's \"Times Herald-Record\", the only local daily newspaper, editorialized against the law that banned the festival from Wallkill. During the festival, a rare Saturday edition was published. The paper had the only phone line running out of the site, and it used a motorcyclist to get stories and pictures from the impassable crowd to the newspaper's office away in Middletown.\n\"East Village Other\" reported, before \"Woodstock Music and Arts Fair\" in the 14 August 1969 issue, and after the event in the 20 August 1969 issue.\nReleases.\nFilms.\n1970 documentary.\nThe documentary film \"Woodstock\", directed by Michael Wadleigh and edited by a crew headed by Thelma Schoonmaker, was released in March 1970. Artie Kornfeld (one of the promoters of the festival) went to Fred Weintraub, an executive at Warner Bros., and asked for money to film the festival. Kornfeld had been turned down everywhere else, but against the express wishes of other Warner Bros. executives, Weintraub put his job on the line and gave Kornfeld $100,000 (equivalent to $ today) to make the film. \"Woodstock\" helped to save Warner Bros. at a time when the company was on the verge of going out of business. The book \"Easy Riders, Raging Bulls\" details the making of the film.\nWadleigh rounded up a crew of about 100 from the New York film scene. With no money to pay the crew, he agreed to a double-or-nothing scheme, in which the crew would receive double pay if the film succeeded and nothing if it bombed. Wadleigh strove to make the film as much about the hippies as the music, listening to their feelings about compelling events contemporaneous with the festival (such as the Vietnam War), as well as the views of the townspeople.\n\"Woodstock\" received the Academy Award for Documentary Feature. In 1996, the film was inducted into the Library of Congress National Film Registry. In 1994, \"Woodstock: The Director's Cut\" was released and expanded to include Janis Joplin as well as additional performances by Jefferson Airplane, Jimi Hendrix, and Canned Heat not seen in the original version of the film. In 2009, the expanded 40th Anniversary Edition was released on DVD. This release marked the film's first availability on Blu-ray.\nOther films.\n\"Woodstock Diary\" was produced by D. A. Pennebaker in 1994 as a three-part TV documentary miniseries. It was intended to commemorate Woodstock's 25th anniversary and included rare performances and interviews with many of the concert's producers, including Joel Rosenman, John Roberts and Michael Lang.\n\"Jimi Hendrix: Live at Woodstock\" was produced in 2005 as two-disc set that included all available footage of Hendrix's Woodstock performance in two different edits. The release also included a mini-documentary with members of Hendrix's band, and footage of a September 1969 news conference where he discussed his Woodstock set.\n\"Taking Woodstock\" was produced in 2009 by Taiwanese American filmmaker Ang Lee. Lee practically rented out the entire town of New Lebanon, New York, to shoot the film. He was initially concerned with not angering the locals, but they ended up being very welcoming and willing to help. The movie is based on Elliot Tiber, played by Demetri Martin, and his role in bringing Woodstock to Bethel, New York. The film also starred Jonathan Groff as Michael Lang, Daniel Eric Gold as Joel Rosenman, and Henry Goodman and Imelda Staunton as Jake and Sonia Teichberg.\n\"Woodstock: Three Days That Defined a Generation\" is a documentary by Barak Goodman, produced in 2019 by PBS. It focused on Woodstock's social and political context and contained previously unseen footage supplemented by voice-over anecdotes from people at the festival. It focused more on the scenes in the crowd (and around the country) than on the stage.\n\"Creating Woodstock\" was directed by Mick Richards and produced in 2019. It looked at how the festival came together, with interviews with producers clarifying some of Woodstock's myths and what it took to get many performers to attend. (Janis Joplin, for example, apparently required a personal supply of strawberries.)\nAlbums.\nSoundtrack albums and 25th anniversary releases.\nTwo soundtrack albums were released. The first, \"\", was a 3-LP (later 2-CD) album containing a sampling of one or two songs by most of the acts who performed. A year later, \"Woodstock 2\" was released as a 2-LP album. Both albums included recordings of stage announcements (many by Production Coordinator John Morris, e.g., \"[We're told] that the brown acid is not specifically too good\", \"Hey, if you think really hard, maybe we can stop this rain\") and crowd noises (i.e., the rain chant) between songs. In August 1994, a third album, \"Woodstock Diary\" was released, containing music not included on the earlier two albums.\nTracks from all three albums, as well as numerous additional, previously unreleased performances from the festival (but not the stage announcements and crowd noises) were reissued by Atlantic, also in August 1994, as a four compact disc box set titled \"\".\nAn album titled \"Jimi Hendrix: Woodstock\" was also released in August 1994, featuring only selected recordings of Jimi Hendrix at the festival.\n30th anniversary releases.\nIn July 1999, MCA Records released \"Live at Woodstock\", an expanded, double disc set featuring nearly every song of Hendrix's performance, omitting just two pieces that were sung by his rhythm guitarist Larry Lee.\n40th anniversary releases.\nIn June 2009, complete performances from Woodstock by Santana, Janis Joplin, Sly &amp; the Family Stone, Jefferson Airplane, and Johnny Winter were released separately by Legacy/SME Records, and were also collected in a box set titled \"The Woodstock Experience\".\nIn August 2009, Rhino/Atlantic Records issued a six-disc box set titled \"\", which included further musical performances as well as stage announcements and other ancillary material.\nIn October 2009, Joe Cocker released \"Live at Woodstock\", a live album of his entire Woodstock set. The album contains eleven tracks, ten of which were previously unreleased.\n50th anniversary releases.\nOn August 2, 2019, the Rhino/Atlantic released \"\", a massive 38 disc, 36-hour, 432-song completists' audio box set of nearly every note played at the original 1969 Woodstock festival (including 276 songs that were previously unreleased), a \"CD collection [co-produced for Rhino by archivist Andy Zax] that lays the '69 fest out in chronological order, from the first stage announcements to muddy farewells.\" The only things missing from this 38-CD edition were two Jimi Hendrix songs that his estate did not believe were up to the required standard and some of Sha Na Na's music that missed being captured on tape. Because of various production and warehousing issues, the release of the box set was delayed, causing a backlash and dissatisfaction toward Rhino and Warner Music. More condensed versions \u2014 and \u2014 were also released. The full version was limited to a run of only 1,969 copies.\nAlso released in 2019 was \"Live at Woodstock\", an official album of all 11 songs played by Creedence Clearwater Revival, from \"Born on the Bayou\" to \"Bad Moon Rising\" and \"Proud Mary\". John Fogerty had originally thought the band's performance was unworthy, but this album was finally released both on CD and as a double vinyl LP.\nAftermath.\nIn the years immediately following the festival, Woodstock co-producers John Roberts and Joel Rosenman, along with Robert Pilpel, wrote \"Young Men with Unlimited Capital: The Inside Story of the Legendary Woodstock Festival Told By The Two People Who Paid for It\", a book about the events behind the scenes during the production of the Woodstock Festival.\nBethel voters did not re-elect Supervisor Amatucci in an election held in November 1969 because of his role in bringing the festival to the town and the upset attributed to some residents. Although accounts vary, it was decided by only a small margin of between six and fifty votes. The New York State Legislature and the Town of Bethel also enacted mass gathering laws designed to prevent any more festivals from occurring.\nApproximately 80 lawsuits were filed against Woodstock Ventures, primarily by farmers in the area. The movie financed settlements and paid off the $1.4\u00a0million of debt (equivalent to $ million today) Roberts and Rosenman had incurred from the festival. Max Yasgur refused to rent out his farm for a 1970 revival of the festival, saying, \"As far as I know, I'm going back to running a dairy farm.\" Yasgur died in 1973.\nIn 1984, at the original festival site, land owners Louis Nicky and June Gelish put up a monument marker with plaques called \"Peace and Music\" by a local sculptor from nearby Bloomingburg, Wayne C. Saward.\nAttempts were made to prevent people from visiting the site. Its owners spread chicken manure, and during one anniversary, tractors and state police cars formed roadblocks. Twenty thousand people gathered at the site in 1989 during an impromptu 20th anniversary celebration. In 1997 a community group put up a welcoming sign for visitors. Unlike Bethel, the town of Woodstock made several efforts to capitalize on its connection. Bethel's stance eventually changed and the town began to embrace the festival. Efforts were undertaken to forge a link between Bethel and Woodstock.\nLegacy.\nWoodstock site today.\nThe field and the stage area remain preserved and are open to visitors as part of the Bethel Woods Center for the Arts after being purchased in 1996 by cable television pioneer Alan Gerry for the purpose. The center opened on July 1, 2006, with a performance by the New York Philharmonic on a newly constructed pavilion stage located about SSE of the site of the 1969 stage. (The site of the original stage is vacant except for a commemorative plaque which was placed in 1984.) In June 2008 the Bethel Woods Center opened a museum dedicated to the experience and cultural significance of the Woodstock festival.\nNotable events since the opening of the center have included an August 2006 performance by Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young and the scattering of Richie Havens's ashes in August 2013.\nIn late 2016 New York's State Historic Preservation Office applied to the National Park Service to have , including the site of the festival and adjacent areas used for campgrounds, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and the site was listed on the register in February 2017.\nWoodstock 40th anniversary.\nThere was worldwide media interest in the 40th anniversary of Woodstock in 2009. A number of activities to commemorate the festival took place around the world. On August 15, at the Bethel Woods Center for the Arts overlooking the original site, the largest assembly of Woodstock performing alumni since the original 1969 festival performed in an eight-hour concert in front of a sold-out crowd. Hosted by Country Joe McDonald, the concert featured Big Brother and the Holding Company performing Janis Joplin's hits (she actually appeared with the Kozmic Blues Band at Woodstock, although that band did feature former Big Brother guitarist Sam Andrew), Canned Heat, Ten Years After, Jefferson Starship, Mountain and headliners the Levon Helm Band. At Woodstock, Levon Helm played drums and was one of the lead vocalists with the Band. Paul Kantner was the only member of the 1969 Jefferson Airplane lineup to appear with Jefferson Starship. Tom Constanten, who played keyboard with the Grateful Dead at Woodstock, joined Jefferson Starship on stage for several numbers. Jocko Marcellino from Sha Na Na also appeared, backed up by Canned Heat. Richie Havens, who opened the Woodstock festival in 1969, appeared at a separate event the previous night. Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash and Arlo Guthrie also marked the anniversary with live performances at Bethel earlier in August 2009.\nAnother event occurred in Hawkhurst, Kent (UK), at a Summer of Love party, with acts including two of the participants at the original Woodstock, Barry Melton of Country Joe and the Fish and Robin Williamson of the Incredible String Band, plus Santana and Grateful Dead cover bands. On August 14 and 15, 2009, a 40th anniversary tribute concert was held in Woodstock, Illinois, and was the only festival to receive the official blessing of the \"Father of Woodstock\", Artie Kornfeld. Kornfeld later made an appearance in Woodstock with the event's promoters.\nAlso in 2009, Michael Lang and Holly George-Warren published \"The Road to Woodstock\", which describes Lang's involvement in the creation of the Woodstock Music &amp; Arts Festival, and includes personal stories and quotes from central figures involved in the event.\nWoodstock 50th anniversary.\nIn May 2014, Michael Lang, one of the producers and organizers of the original Woodstock event, revealed plans for a possible 50th anniversary concert in 2019 and that he was exploring various locations. Reports in late 2018 confirmed the plans for a concurrent 50th anniversary event on the original site to be operated by the Bethel Woods Centre for the Arts. The scheduled date for the \"Bethel Woods Music and Culture Festival: Celebrating the golden anniversary at the historic site of the 1969 Woodstock festival\" was August 16\u201318, 2019. Bethel Woods described the festival as a \"pan-generational music, culture and community event\" (including some live performances and talks by) \"leading futurists and retro-tech experts\".\nMichael Lang told a reporter that he also had \"definite plans\" for a 50th anniversary concert that would \"hopefully encourage people to get involved with our lives on the planet\" with a goal of re-capturing the \"history and essence of what Woodstock was\". On January 9, 2019, Lang announced that the official Woodstock 50th anniversary festival would take place on August 16\u201318, 2019 in Watkins Glen, New York.\nOn March 19, 2019, the proposed lineup for Woodstock 50 was announced. This included some artists who performed at the original Woodstock festival in 1969: John Fogerty (from Creedence Clearwater Revival), Carlos Santana (as Santana), David Crosby (from Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash), Melanie, John Sebastian, Country Joe McDonald, three Grateful Dead members (as Dead &amp; Company), Canned Heat, and Hot Tuna (containing members of Jefferson Airplane). The event was to take place at Watkins Glen International, the race track in Watkins Glen, New York, the site in 1973 for the Summer Jam at Watkins Glen which drew an estimated 600,000 people.\nOn April 29, 2019, it was announced that Woodstock 50 had been canceled by investors (Dentsu Aegis Network), who had lost faith in its preparations. The producers \"vehemently\" denied any cancellation, with Michael Lang telling \"The New York Times\" that investors have no such prerogative.\nAfter a lawsuit with original financiers, the Woodstock 50 team then announced that it had received help from Oppenheimer &amp; Co. for financing so that the three-day event can continue to take place in August despite the original financiers pulling out. On July 31, 2019, NPR reported that the concert had finally been canceled. The Bethel Woods Center for the Arts did organize a weekend of \"low-key\" concerts.\nLocal economic impact.\nWoodstock still acts as an economic engine for the local economy. A Bethel Woods report from 2018 indicates that $560.82\u00a0million of spending has been generated in New York. With 2.9\u00a0million visitors since 2006 and 214,405 visitors in 2018, an equivalent of 172 full-time jobs exist as a result, which includes direct wages of $5.1\u00a0million from Bethel Woods in Sullivan County.\nIn popular culture.\nAs one of the biggest music festivals of all time and a cultural touchstone for the late 1960s, Woodstock has been referenced in many different ways in popular culture. The phrase \"the Woodstock generation\" became part of the common lexicon. Tributes and parodies of the festival began almost as soon as the festival concluded. Cartoonist Charles Schulz named his recurring \"Peanuts\" bird character (which began appearing in 1966 but was still unnamed) Woodstock in tribute to the festival. In April 1970, \"Mad\" magazine published a poem by Frank Jacobs and illustrated by Sergio Aragon\u00e9s titled \"I Remember, I Remember The Wondrous Woodstock Music Fair\" that parodies the traffic jams and the challenges of getting close enough to actually hear the music. Keith Robertson's 1970 children's book \"Henry Reed's Big Show\" has the title character attempting to emulate the success of the festival by having his own concert at his uncle's farm.\nIn 1973, the stage show \"National Lampoon's Lemmings\" portrayed the \"Woodchuck\" festival, featuring parodies of many Woodstock performers.\n\"Time\" magazine named \"The Who at Woodstock \u2013 1969\" to the magazine's \"Top 10 Music-Festival Moments\" list on March 18, 2010.\nIn 2005, Argentine writer Edgar Brau published \"Woodstock\", a long poem commemorating the festival. An English translation of the poem was published in January 2007 by Words Without Borders.\nIn 2017, the singer Lana Del Rey released a song, \"Coachella \u2013 Woodstock in My Mind,\" to show her worries about the tensions between North Korea and the United States while she was at Coachella, expressing nostalgia by using the Woodstock festival as a symbol of peace.\nIn 2017, Portland rock band Portugal. The Man released an album titled \"Woodstock\", inspired by a conversation between frontman John Gourley and his father after the latter discovered his ticket stub for the festival.\nIn August 2019, the United States Postal Service released a Forever stamp commemorating Woodstock's 50th anniversary. The stamp was designed by Antonio Alcal\u00e1, Art Director of the USPS and was first issued at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City on August 8, 2019. The museum was hosting \"Play it Loud\", an exhibit co-organized with the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame consisting of vintage rock and roll instruments, posters, and costumes. Attending the ceremony were Woodstock producers Michael Lang and Joel Rosenman. The ceremony began with a \"stirring\" electric guitar performance of \"The Star Spangled Banner\" by \"Captain\" Kirk Douglas of the Roots\u2014\"reminiscent\" of Jimi Hendrix's performance at the original festival.\nIn 2023, a South Korean organizer officially purchased Woodstock's license and tried to hold a festival in Pocheon, but there was a lot of controversy because of insufficient preparation in the process of preparing for the festival, and it was eventually canceled.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Although it is possible for a washtub bass to have four or more strings and tuning pegs, traditional washtub basses have a single string whose pitch is adjusted by pushing or pulling on a staff or stick to change the tension.\nThe washtub bass was used in jug bands that were popular in some African-American communities in the early 1900s. In the 1950s, British skiffle bands used a variant called a tea chest bass, and during the 1960s, US folk musicians used the washtub bass in jug band-influenced music.\nVariations on the basic design are found around the world, particularly in the choice of resonator. As a result, there are many different names for the instrument including the \"gas-tank bass\", \"barrel bass\", \"box bass\" (Trinidad), \"bush bass\" (Australia), \"babatoni\" (South Africa), \"tanbou marengwen\" (Haiti) \"tingotalango\" (Cuba), \"\" (Italy), \"laundrophone\" and others.\nThe hallmarks of the traditional design are simplicity, very low cost and do it yourself construction, leading to its historical association with lower economic classes. These factors also make it quite common for modern-day builders to promote modifications to the basic design, such as adding a finger board, pedal, electronic pickup, drumhead, or making the staff immovable.\nHistory.\nEthnomusicologists trace the origins of the instrument to the 'ground bow' or 'ground harp' \u2013 a version that uses a piece of bark or an animal skin stretched over a pit as a resonator. The \"ang-bindi\" made by the Baka people of the Congo is but one example of this instrument found among tribal societies in Africa and Southeast Asia, and it lends its name to the generic term \"inbindi\" for all related instruments. Evolution of design, including the use of more portable resonators, has led to many variations, such as the \"dan bau\" (Vietnam) and \"gopichand\" (India), and more recently, the \"electric one-string\", which amplifies the sound using a pickup.\nThe washtub bass is sometimes used in a jug band, often accompanied by a washboard as a percussion instrument. Jug bands, first known as \"spasm bands\", were popular especially among African-Americans around 1900 in New Orleans and reached a height of popularity between 1925 and 1935 in Memphis and Louisville.\nAt about the same time, European-Americans of Appalachia were using the instrument in \"old-timey\" folk music. A musical style known as \"gut-bucket blues\" came out of the jug band scene, and was cited by Sam Phillips of Sun Records as the type of music he was seeking when he first recorded Elvis Presley.\nAccording to Willie \"The Lion\" Smith's autobiography, the term \"gutbucket\" comes from \"Negro families\" who all owned their own pail, or bucket, and would get it filled with the makings for chitterlings. The term \"gutbucket\" came from playing a lowdown style of music.\nIn English skiffle bands, Australian and New Zealand bush bands and South African kwela bands, the same sort of bass has a tea chest as a resonator. The Quarrymen, John Lennon and Paul McCartney's band before the Beatles, featured a tea-chest bass, as did many young bands around 1956.\nA folk music revival in the U.S. in the early 1960s re-ignited interest in the washtub bass and jug band music. Bands included Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions, which later became The Grateful Dead, and the Jim Kweskin Jug Band, which featured Fritz Richmond on bass.\nTea chest bass.\nA tea chest bass is a variation of the washtub bass that uses a tea chest as the resonator for an upright stringed bass. The instrument is made from a pole, traditionally a broomstick, placed into or alongside the chest. One or more strings are stretched along the pole and plucked.\nIn Europe, particularly Britain and Germany, the instrument is associated with skiffle bands.\nIn Australia it was traditionally used to provide deep sounds for \"bush bands\", though most such groups today use electric bass or double bass. It is also known as bush bass or Tbox in Australia, and was used by the Northern Territory group the Mills Sisters.\nOther variations.\nOther variations on the basic design are found around the world, particularly in the choice of resonator, for example:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The primary benefit of the circuit is its ability to provide extremely accurate measurements (in contrast with something like a simple voltage divider). Its operation is similar to the original potentiometer.\nThe Wheatstone bridge was invented by Samuel Hunter Christie (sometimes spelled \"Christy\") in 1833 and improved and popularized by Sir Charles Wheatstone in 1843. One of the Wheatstone bridge's initial uses was for soil analysis and comparison.\nOperation.\nIn the figure, \"Rx\" is the fixed, yet unknown, resistance to be measured.\n\"R\"1, \"R\"2, and \"R\"3 are resistors of known resistance and the resistance of \"R\"2 is adjustable. The resistance \"R\"2 is adjusted until the bridge is \"balanced\" and no current flows through the galvanometer \"Vg\". At this point, the potential difference between the two midpoints (B and D) will be zero. Therefore the ratio of the two resistances in the known leg (\"R\"2\u2009/\u2009\"R\"1) is equal to the ratio of the two resistances in the unknown leg (\"Rx\"\u2009/\u2009\"R\"3). If the bridge is unbalanced, the direction of the current indicates whether \"R\"2 is too high or too low.\nAt the point of balance,\nformula_1\nDetecting zero current with a galvanometer can be done to extremely high precision. Therefore, if \"R\"1, \"R\"2, and \"R\"3 are known to high precision, then \"Rx\" can be measured to high precision. Very small changes in \"Rx\" disrupt the balance and are readily detected.\nAlternatively, if \"R\"1, \"R\"2, and \"R\"3 are known, but \"R\"2 is not adjustable, the voltage difference across or current flow through the meter can be used to calculate the value of \"Rx\", using Kirchhoff's circuit laws. This setup is frequently used in strain gauge and resistance thermometer measurements, as it is usually faster to read a voltage level off a meter than to adjust a resistance to zero the voltage.\nDerivation.\nQuick derivation at balance.\nAt the point of balance, both the voltage and the current between the two midpoints (B and D) are zero. Therefore, \"I\"1 = \"I\"2, \"I\"3 = \"I\"\"x\", \"V\"D = \"V\"B.\nBecause of \"V\"D = \"V\"B, then \"V\"DC = \"V\"BC and \"V\"AD = \"V\"AB.\nDividing the last two equations by members and using the above currents equalities, then\nformula_2\nAlternative derivation at balance using voltage divider expressions.\nADC and ABC form two voltage dividers, with VG equal to the difference in output voltages. Thus\nformula_3\nFull derivation using Kirchhoff's circuit laws.\nFirst, Kirchhoff's first law is used to find the currents in junctions B and D:\nformula_4\nThen, Kirchhoff's second law is used for finding the voltage in the loops ABDA and BCDB:\nformula_5\nWhen the bridge is balanced, then \"I\"\"G\" \n 0, so the second set of equations can be rewritten as:\nformula_6\nThen, equation (1) is divided by equation (2) and the resulting equation is rearranged, giving:\nformula_7\nDue to \"I\"3 = \"I\"\"x\" and \"I\"1 = \"I\"2 being proportional from Kirchhoff's First Law, \"I\"3\"I\"2\u2009/\u2009\"I\"1\"I\"x cancels out of the above equation. The desired value of \"R\"\"x\" is now known to be given as:\nformula_7\nOn the other hand, if the resistance of the galvanometer is high enough that \"I\"\"G\" is negligible, it is possible to compute \"R\"\"x\" from the three other resistor values and the supply voltage (), or the supply voltage from all four resistor values. To do so, one has to work out the voltage from each potential divider and subtract one from the other. The equations for this are:\nformula_9\nwhere \"V\"\"G\" is the voltage of node D relative to node B.\nSignificance.\nThe Wheatstone bridge illustrates the concept of a difference measurement, which can be extremely accurate. Variations on the Wheatstone bridge can be used to measure capacitance, inductance, impedance and other quantities, such as the amount of combustible gases in a sample, with an explosimeter. The Kelvin bridge was specially adapted from the Wheatstone bridge for measuring very low resistances. In many cases, the significance of measuring the unknown resistance is related to measuring the impact of some physical phenomenon (such as force, temperature, pressure, etc.) which thereby allows the use of Wheatstone bridge in measuring those elements indirectly.\nThe concept was extended to alternating current measurements by James Clerk Maxwell in 1865 and further improved as &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Blumlein bridge by Alan Blumlein in British Patent no. 323,037, 1928.\nModifications of the basic bridge.\nThe Wheatstone bridge is the fundamental bridge, but there are other modifications that can be made to measure various kinds of resistances when the fundamental Wheatstone bridge is not suitable. Some of the modifications are:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It had about 84,646 inhabitants as of 2022[ [update]].\nA pre-Roman foundation, Worms is one of the oldest cities in northern Europe. It was the capital of the Kingdom of the Burgundians in the early fifth century, hence is the scene of the medieval legends referring to this period, notably the first part of the \"Nibelungenlied\".\nWorms has been a Roman Catholic bishopric since at least 614, and was an important palatinate of Charlemagne. Worms Cathedral is one of the imperial cathedrals and among the finest examples of Romanesque architecture in Germany. Worms prospered in the High Middle Ages as an imperial free city. Among more than a hundred imperial diets held at Worms, the Diet of 1521 (commonly known as \"the\" Diet of Worms) ended with the Edict of Worms, in which Martin Luther was declared a heretic. Worms is also one of the historical ShUM-cities as a cultural center of Jewish life in Europe during the Middle Ages. Its Jewish sites (along with those in Speyer and Mainz) were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2021.\nToday, the city is an industrial centre and is famed as the origin of \"Liebfraumilch\" wine. Its other industries include chemicals, metal goods, and fodder.\nName.\nWorms's name is of Celtic origin: \"Borbetomagus\" meant \"settlement in a watery area\". This was eventually transformed into the Latin name \"Vormatia\", in use since the 6th century, which was preserved in the Medieval Hebrew form \"Vermayza\" (\u05d5\u05e8\u05de\u05d9\u05d9\u05d6\u05d0) and the contemporary Polish form \"Wormacja\".\nAccording to a legend printed in the 17th century in the book \"Ma'aseh Nisim\" by Juspa Schammes, the origin of the city's name is attributed to the mythical creature lint-wurm. This creature, resembling a snake and a worm, arrived in the city of Germisa and terrorized its inhabitants. Every day, the people held a lottery to determine which of them would be sacrificed to the lint-wurm in order to spare the city from destruction. Eventually, the lot fell on the queen. One of the city's heroes refused to allow her to sacrifice herself and offered to replace her on the condition that if he survived, she would marry him. The queen agreed, and he donned iron armor. After the lint-wurm swallowed him, he cut his way out from the inside and killed it. He married the queen, became king, and renamed the city to Worms to commemorate this tale.\nGeography.\nWorms is located on the west bank of the River Rhine between the cities of Ludwigshafen and Mainz. On the northern edge of the city, the Pfrimm flows into the Rhine, and on the southern edge, the Eisbach flows into the Rhine.\nBoroughs.\nWorms has 13 boroughs (or \"quarters\") around the city centre. They are:\nClimate.\nThe climate in the Rhine Valley is cool in winter and very warm in summer. Rainfall is below average for the surrounding areas. Winter snow accumulation is low and often melts quickly.\nHistory.\nAntiquity.\nWorms was in ancient times a Celtic city named \"Borbetomagus\", perhaps meaning \"water meadow\". Later it was conquered by the Germanic Vangiones tribe. In 14 BC, Romans under the command of Drusus captured and fortified the city, and from that time onwards, a small troop of infantry and cavalry was garrisoned there. The Romans renamed the city as \"Augusta Vangionum\", after the then-emperor and the local tribe. The name does not seem to have taken hold, however, and from \"Borbetomagus\" developed the German \"Worms\" and Latin \"Wormatia\"; as late as the modern period, the city name was written as \"Wormbs\". The garrison grew into a small town with a regular Roman street plan, a forum, and temples for the main gods Jupiter, Juno, Minerva (whose temple was the site of the later cathedral), and Mars.\nRoman inscriptions, altars, and votive offerings can be seen in the archaeological museum, along with one of Europe's largest collections of Roman glass. Local potters worked in the town's south quarter. Fragments of \"amphorae\" contain traces of olive oil from Hispania Baetica, doubtless transported by sea and then up the Rhine by ship.\nDuring the disorders of 411\u2013413 AD, Roman usurper Jovinus established himself in Borbetomagus as a puppet-emperor with the help of King Gunther of the Burgundians, who had settled in the area between the Rhine and Moselle some years before. The city became the capital of the Burgundian kingdom under Gunther (also known as Gundicar). Few remains of this early Burgundian kingdom survive, because in 436, it was all but destroyed by a combined army of Romans (led by A\u00ebtius) and Huns (led by Attila); a belt clasp found at Worms-Abenheim is a museum treasure. Provoked by Burgundian raids against Roman settlements, the combined Romano-Hunnic army destroyed the Burgundian army at the Battle of Worms (436), killing King Gunther. About 20,000 are said to have been killed. The Romans led the survivors southwards to the Roman district of Sapaudia (modern-day Savoy). The story of this war later inspired the \"Nibelungenlied\". The city appears on the Peutinger Map, dated to the fourth century.\nMiddle Ages.\nThe bishopric of Worms existed by at least 614. In the Frankish Empire, the city was the location of an important palace of Charlemagne. The bishops administered the city and its territory. The most famous of the early medieval bishops was Burchard of Worms. In 868, an important synod was held in Worms. Around 900, the circuit wall was rebuilt according to the wall-building ordinance of Bishop .\nWorms prospered in the High Middle Ages. Having received far-reaching privileges from King Henry IV as early as 1074, the city became an imperial free city. The bishops resided at Ladenburg and only had jurisdiction over Worms Cathedral itself. In 1122, the Concordat of Worms was signed; the 1495 imperial diet met here and made an attempt at reforming the disintegrating Imperial Circle Estates by the Imperial Reform. Most important, among more than 100 imperial diets held at Worms, that of 1521 (commonly known as \"the\" Diet of Worms) ended with the Edict of Worms, in which Martin Luther was declared a heretic after refusing to recant his religious beliefs. Worms was also the birthplace of the first Bibles of the Reformation, both Martin Luther's German Bible and William Tyndale's first complete English New Testament by 1526.\nModern era.\nIn 1689 during the Nine Years' War, Worms (like the nearby towns and cities of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Oppenheim, Speyer, and Bingen) was sacked by troops of Louis XIV of France, though the French only held the city for a few weeks. In 1743, the Treaty of Worms was signed, forming a political alliance between Great Britain, Austria, and the Kingdom of Sardinia. In 1792, the city was occupied by troops of the First French Republic during the French Revolutionary Wars. The Bishopric of Worms was secularized in 1801, with the city being annexed into the First French Empire. In 1815, Worms passed to the Grand Duchy of Hesse in accordance with the Congress of Vienna, and the city was subsequently administered within Rhenish Hesse.\nAfter the Battle of the Bulge in early 1945, Allied armies advanced into the Rhineland in preparation for a massive assault into the heart of the Reich. Worms was a German strongpoint on the west bank of the Rhine, and the forces there resisted the Allied advance tenaciously. Worms was, thus, heavily bombed by the Royal Air Force and the U.S. Army Air Forces in two attacks on 21 February and 18 March 1945, respectively. A postwar survey estimated that 39% of the town's developed area was destroyed. The RAF attack on 21 Feb was aimed at the main railway station on the edge of the inner city, and at chemical plants southwest of the inner city, but also destroyed large areas of the city centre. Carried out by 334 bombers, the attack in a few minutes rained 1,100 tons of bombs on the inner city, and Worms Cathedral was among the buildings set on fire. The Americans did not enter the city until the Rhine crossings began after the seizure of the Remagen Bridge.\nIn the attacks, 239 inhabitants were killed in the first and 141 in the second; 35,000 (60% of the population of 58,000) were made homeless. In all, 6,490 buildings were severely damaged or destroyed. After the war, the inner city was rebuilt, mostly in modern style. Around a third of Worms's buildings are from before 1950. Postwar Worms became part of the new state of Rhineland-Palatinate; the borough Rosengarten, on the east bank of the Rhine, was lost to Hesse.\nWorms today fiercely vies with the cities Trier and Cologne for the title of \"Oldest City in Germany\". A multimedia \"Nibelungenmuseum\" was opened in 2001, and a yearly festival in front of the \"Dom\", the Worms Cathedral, attempts to recapture the atmosphere of the pre-Christian period.\nIn 2010, the Worms synagogue was firebombed. Eight corners of the building were set ablaze, and a Molotov cocktail was thrown at a window, but with no injuries. Kurt Beck, Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate, condemned the attack and vowed to mobilize all necessary resources to find the perpetrators, saying, \"We will not tolerate such an attack on a synagogue\".\nThe Jewish community of \"Varmayza\".\nThe Free Imperial City of Worms, known in medieval Hebrew by the name \"Varmayza\" or \"Vermaysa\" (Hebrew: \u05d5\u05d5\u05e8\u05de\u05d9\u05d6\u05d0, \u05d5\u05d5\u05e8\u05de\u05d9\u05e9\u05d0), was a centre of medieval Ashkenazic Jewry. The Jewish community was established there in the late 10th century, and Worms's first synagogue was erected in 1034. The Jewish community settled in a separate neighborhood in the city called the Judengasse. In 1096, 800 to 1000 Jews were murdered by crusaders and the local mob, what later became known as Rhineland massacres or \"Gzerot Tatn\u00f3\" (Hebrew: \u05d2\u05d6\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea \u05ea\u05ea\u05e0\"\u05d5, \"Edicts of 4856\"). The Jewish Cemetery in Worms, dating from the 11th century, is believed to be the oldest surviving \"in situ\" cemetery in Europe. The Rashi Synagogue, which dates from 1175 and was carefully reconstructed after its desecration on \"Kristallnacht\", is the oldest in Germany.\nProminent students, rabbis, and scholars of Worms include Shlomo Yitzhaki (Rashi) who studied with R. Yizhak Halevi, Meir of Rothenburg (Maharam), Elazar Rokeach, Yaakov ben Moshe Levi Moelin (Maharil), and Yair Bacharach. At the rabbinical synod held at Worms at the turn of the 11th century, Rabbi Gershom ben Judah (Rabbeinu Gershom) explicitly prohibited polygamy for the first time. The community's customs were collected and written by Juspa Schammes in a \"Minhagbuch (book of customs)\" and preserve ancient traditions unique to the community.\nThe Jewish community was destroyed and expelled from the city several times. The main expulsions were both in 1615 after the city's residents committed a pogrom against the Jewish community and in 1689 during the Nine Years' War by troops of Louis XIV (with all the city's citizens), After a few years, the Jews were allowed to return to live in the city. Despite this, until \"Kristallnacht\" in 1938, the Jewish Quarter of Worms was a centre of Jewish life. It was among the oldest Jewish communities that maintained continuity over time, and a beautiful example of this is the 900th anniversary celebrations of the synagogue held in 1934.\nWorms today has only a very small Jewish population, and a recognizable Jewish community as such no longer exists. After renovations in the 1970s and 1980s, though, many of the buildings of the quarter can be seen in a close-to-original state, preserved as an outdoor museum. The Jewish sites (along with those in Speyer and Mainz) were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2021.\nTransport.\nThe town is served by Frankfurt Airport, which is located to the north-east of Worms. The airport provides domestic and international destinations. The trip to and from the airport takes about 42 minutes by car or approximately 57 minutes by InterCityExpress train.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nWorms is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, such as news, education, commerce, entertainment, or social media. Hyperlinking between web pages guides the navigation of the site, which often starts with a home page. The most-visited sites are Google, YouTube, and Facebook. \nAll publicly-accessible websites collectively constitute the World Wide Web. There are also private websites that can only be accessed on a private network, such as a company's internal website for its employees. Users can access websites on a range of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. The app used on these devices is called a web browser.\nBackground.\nThe World Wide Web (WWW) was created in 1989 by the British CERN computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee. On 30 April 1993, CERN announced that the World Wide Web would be free to use for anyone, contributing to the immense growth of the Web. Before the introduction of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), other protocols such as File Transfer Protocol and the gopher protocol were used to retrieve individual files from a server. These protocols offer a simple directory structure in which the user navigates and where they choose files to download. Documents were most often presented as plain text files without formatting or were encoded in word processor formats.\nHistory.\nWhile \"web site\" was the original spelling (sometimes capitalized \"Web site\", since \"Web\" is a proper noun when referring to the World Wide Web), this variant has become rarely used, and \"website\" has become the standard spelling. All major style guides, such as \"The Chicago Manual of Style\" and the \"AP Stylebook\", have reflected this change.\nIn February 2009, Netcraft, an Internet monitoring company that has tracked Web growth since 1995, reported that there were 215,675,903 websites with domain names and content on them in 2009, compared to just 19,732 websites in August 1995. After reaching 1 billion websites in September 2014, a milestone confirmed by Netcraft in its October 2014 Web Server Survey and that Internet Live Stats was the first to announce\u2014as attested by this tweet from the inventor of the World Wide Web himself, Tim Berners-Lee\u2014the number of websites in the world have subsequently declined, reverting to a level below 1 billion. This is due to the monthly fluctuations in the count of inactive websites. The number of websites continued growing to over 1 billion by March 2016 and has continued growing since. Netcraft Web Server Survey in January 2020 reported that there are 1,295,973,827 websites and in April 2021 reported that there are 1,212,139,815 sites across 10,939,637 web-facing computers, and 264,469,666 unique domains. An estimated 85 percent of all websites are inactive.\nStatic website.\nA static website is one that has Web pages stored on the server in the format that is sent to a client Web browser. It is primarily coded in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML); Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used to control appearance beyond basic HTML. Images are commonly used to create the desired appearance and as part of the main content. Audio or video might also be considered \"static\" content if it plays automatically or is generally non-interactive. This type of website usually displays the same information to all visitors. Similar to handing out a printed brochure to customers or clients, a static website will generally provide consistent, standard information for an extended period of time. Although the website owner may make updates periodically, it is a manual process to edit the text, photos, and other content and may require basic website design skills and software. Simple forms or marketing examples of websites, such as a \"classic website\", a \"five-page website\" or a \"brochure website\" are often static websites, because they present pre-defined, static information to the user. This may include information about a company and its products and services through text, photos, animations, audio/video, and navigation menus.\nStatic websites may still use server side includes (SSI) as an editing convenience, such as sharing a common menu bar across many pages. As the site's behavior \"to the reader\" is still static, this is not considered a dynamic site.\nDynamic website.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nA dynamic website is one that changes or customizes itself frequently and automatically. Server-side dynamic pages are generated \"on the fly\" by computer code that produces the HTML (CSS are responsible for appearance and thus, are static files). There are a wide range of software systems, such as CGI, Java Servlets and Java Server Pages (JSP), Active Server Pages and ColdFusion (CFML) that are available to generate dynamic Web systems and dynamic sites. Various Web application frameworks and Web template systems are available for general-use programming languages like Perl, PHP, Python and Ruby to make it faster and easier to create complex dynamic websites.\nA site can display the current state of a dialogue between users, monitor a changing situation, or provide information in some way personalized to the requirements of the individual user. For example, when the front page of a news site is requested, the code running on the webserver might combine stored HTML fragments with news stories retrieved from a database or another website via RSS to produce a page that includes the latest information. Dynamic sites can be interactive by using HTML forms, storing and reading back browser cookies, or by creating a series of pages that reflect the previous history of clicks. Another example of dynamic content is when a retail website with a database of media products allows a user to input a search request, e.g. for the keyword Beatles. In response, the content of the Web page will spontaneously change the way it looked before, and will then display a list of Beatles products like CDs, DVDs, and books. Dynamic HTML uses JavaScript code to instruct the Web browser how to interactively modify the page contents. One way to simulate a certain type of dynamic website while avoiding the performance loss of initiating the dynamic engine on a per-user or per-connection basis is to periodically automatically regenerate a large series of static pages.\nMultimedia and interactive content.\nEarly websites had only text, and soon after, images. Web browser plug-ins were then used to add audio, video, and interactivity (such as for a rich Web application that mirrors the complexity of a desktop application like a word processor). Examples of such plug-ins are Microsoft Silverlight, Adobe Flash Player, Adobe Shockwave Player, and Java SE. HTML 5 includes provisions for audio and video without plugins. JavaScript is also built into most modern web browsers, and allows for website creators to send code to the web browser that instructs it how to interactively modify page content and communicate with the web server if needed. The browser's internal representation of the content is known as the Document Object Model (DOM).\nWebGL (Web Graphics Library) is a modern JavaScript API for rendering interactive 3D graphics without the use of plug-ins. It allows interactive content such as 3D animations, visualizations and video explainers to presented users in the most intuitive way.\nA 2010-era trend in websites called \"responsive design\" has given the best viewing experience as it provides a device-based layout for users. These websites change their layout according to the device or mobile platform, thus giving a rich user experience.\nTypes.\nWebsites can be divided into two broad categories\u2014static and interactive. Interactive sites are part of the Web 2.0 community of sites and allow for interactivity between the site owner and site visitors or users. Static sites serve or capture information but do not allow engagement with the audience or users directly. Some websites are informational or produced by enthusiasts or for personal use or entertainment. Many websites do aim to make money using one or more business models, including:\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is best known for his role in the mutiny on HMS \"Bounty\", which occurred in 1789 when the ship was under his command. The reasons behind the mutiny continue to be debated. After being set adrift in \"Bounty\"'s launch by the mutineers, Bligh and those loyal to him stopped for supplies on Tofua, losing one man to native attacks. Bligh and his men reached Timor alive, after a journey of .\nOn 13 August 1806, Bligh was appointed governor of the British colony of New South Wales, with orders to clean up the corrupt rum trade of the New South Wales Corps. His actions directed against the trade resulted in the so-called Rum Rebellion, during which Bligh was placed under arrest on 26 January 1808 by the New South Wales Corps and deposed from his command, an act which the Foreign Office later declared to be illegal. He died in London on 7 December 1817.\nEarly life.\nBligh was born on 9 September 1754, but it is not clear where. It is likely that he was born in Plymouth, Devon, as he was baptised at St Andrew's Church on Royal Parade in Plymouth on 4 October 1754, where Bligh's father, Francis, was serving as a customs officer. Bligh's ancestral home of Tinten Manor in St Tudy, near Bodmin, Cornwall, is also a possibility. Bligh's mother, Jane Pearce (n\u00e9e Balsam), was a widow who married Francis at the age of 40.\nBligh was signed for the Royal Navy at age seven, at a time when it was common to sign on a \"young gentleman\" simply to gain, or at least record, the experience at sea required for a commission. In 1770, at age 16, he joined HMS \"Hunter\" as an able seaman, the term used because there was no vacancy for a midshipman. He became a midshipman early in the following year. In September 1771, Bligh was transferred to and remained on the ship for three years.\nIn 1776, Bligh was selected by Captain James Cook, for the position of sailing master of and accompanied Cook in July 1776 on Cook's third voyage to the Pacific Ocean, during which Cook was killed and was succeeded by Captain Charles Clerke, who was dying from tuberculosis. Due to his weakened state, Clerke placed Bligh in charge as navigator of the expedition and attempted to explore the Northwest Passage for a second time. Following Cook's and Clerke's deaths, Bligh played a significant role in navigating the beleaguered expedition back to England in August 1780. He was also able to supply details of Cook's last voyage following the return.\nBligh married Elizabeth Betham, daughter of a customs collector (stationed in Douglas, Isle of Man), on 4 February 1781. The wedding took place at nearby Onchan. The couple had eight children together: six daughters and twin sons (the boys died in infancy). The couple remained married until Elizabeth's death on 15 April 1812. A few days after the wedding, Bligh was appointed to serve on HMS \"Belle Poule\" as master (senior warrant officer responsible for navigation). Soon after this, in August 1781, he fought in the Battle of Dogger Bank under Admiral Parker, which won him his commission as a lieutenant. For the next 18 months, he was a lieutenant on various ships. He also fought with Lord Howe at Gibraltar in 1782.\nBetween 1783 and 1787, Bligh was a captain in the Merchant Service. Like many lieutenants, he would have found full-pay employment in the Navy; however, commissions were hard to obtain with the fleet largely demobilised at the end of the War with France, during which that country was allied with the North American rebelling colonies in the War of American Independence (1775\u20131783). In 1787, Bligh was selected as commander of His Majesty's Armed Transport \"Bounty\". He rose eventually to the rank of vice admiral in the Royal Navy.\nNaval career.\nWilliam Bligh's naval career involved various appointments and assignments. He first rose to prominence as Master of \"Resolution\", under the command of Captain James Cook. Bligh received praise from Cook during what would be the latter's final voyage. Bligh served on three of the same ships on which Fletcher Christian also served simultaneously in his naval career.\nIn the early 1780s, while in the merchant service, Bligh became acquainted with a young man named Fletcher Christian (1764\u20131793), who was eager to learn navigation from him. Bligh took Christian under his wing, and the two became friends.\nVoyage of \"Bounty\".\nThe mutiny on the Royal Navy vessel HMAV \"Bounty\" occurred in the South Pacific Ocean on 28 April 1789. Led by Master's Mate / Acting Lieutenant Fletcher Christian, disaffected crewmen seized control of the ship, and set the then Lieutenant Bligh, who was the ship's captain, and 18 loyalists adrift in the ship's open launch. The mutineers variously settled on Tahiti or on Pitcairn Island. Meanwhile, Bligh completed a voyage of more than to the west in the launch to reach safety north of Australia in the Dutch East Indies (modern Indonesia) and began the process of bringing the mutineers to justice.\nFirst breadfruit voyage.\nIn 1787, Lieutenant Bligh, as he then was, took command of HMAV \"Bounty.\" In order to win a premium offered by the Royal Society, he first sailed to Tahiti to obtain breadfruit trees, then set course east across the South Pacific for South America and the Cape Horn and eventually to the Caribbean Sea, where breadfruit was wanted for experiments to see whether it would be a successful food crop for enslaved Africans on British colonial plantations in the West Indies islands. According to one modern researcher, the notion that breadfruit had to be collected from Tahiti was intentionally misleading. Tahiti was merely one of many places where the esteemed seedless breadfruit could be found. The real reason for choosing Tahiti has its roots in the territorial contention that existed then between France and Great Britain at the time. \"Bounty\" never reached the Caribbean, as mutiny broke out on board shortly after the ship left Tahiti.\nThe voyage to Tahiti was difficult. After trying unsuccessfully for a month to go west by rounding South America and Cape Horn, \"Bounty\" was finally defeated by the notoriously stormy weather and opposite winds and forced to take the longer way to the east around the southern tip of Africa (Cape of Good Hope and Cape Agulhas). That delay caused a further delay in Tahiti, as Bligh had to wait five months for the breadfruit plants to mature sufficiently to be potted in soil and transported. \"Bounty\" departed Tahiti heading west in April 1789.\nMutiny.\nBecause the vessel was rated only as a cutter, \"Bounty\" had no commissioned officers other than Bligh (who was then only a lieutenant), a very small crew, and no Royal Marines to provide protection from hostile natives during stops or to enforce security on board ship. To allow longer uninterrupted sleep, Bligh divided his crew into three watches instead of two, placing his \"prot\u00e9g\u00e9\" Fletcher Christian\u2014rated as a Master's Mate\u2014in charge of one of the watches. The mutiny, which took place on 28 April 1789 during the return voyage, was led by Christian and supported by eighteen of the crew. They had seized firearms during Christian's night watch and surprised and bound Bligh in his cabin.\n Despite being in the majority, none of the loyalists put up a significant struggle once they saw Bligh bound, and the ship was taken over without bloodshed. The mutineers provided Bligh and eighteen loyal crewmen a launch (so heavily loaded that the gunwales were only a few inches above the water). They were allowed four cutlasses, food and water for perhaps a week, a quadrant and a compass, but no charts, or marine chronometer. The gunner, William Peckover, brought his pocket watch, which was used to regulate time. Most of these instruments were obtained by the clerk, Mr Samuel, who acted with great calm and resolution, despite threats from the mutineers. The launch could not hold all the loyal crew members, so four were detained on \"Bounty\" for their useful skills; they were later released in Tahiti.\nTahiti was upwind from Bligh's initial position, and was the obvious destination of the mutineers. Many of the loyalists claimed to have heard the mutineers cry \"Huzzah for Otaheite!\" as \"Bounty\" pulled away. Timor was the nearest European colonial outpost in the Dutch East Indies (modern Indonesia), away. Bligh and his crew first made for Tofua, only a few leagues distant, to obtain supplies. However, they were attacked by hostile natives and John Norton, a quartermaster, was killed. Fleeing from Tofua, Bligh did not dare to stop at the next islands to the west (the Fiji islands), as he had only a pair of cutlasses for defence and expected hostile receptions. He did however keep a log entitled \"Log of the Proceedings of His Majesty's Ship Bounty Lieut. Wm Bligh Commander from Otaheite towards Jamaica\" which he used to record events from 5 April 1789 to 13 March 1790. He also made use of a small notebook to sketch a rough map of his discoveries.\nBligh had confidence in his navigational skills, which he had perfected under the instruction of Captain James Cook. His first responsibility was to bring his men to safety. Thus, he undertook the seemingly impossible voyage to Timor, the nearest European settlement. Bligh succeeded in reaching Timor after a 47-day voyage, the only casualty being the crewman killed on Tofua. From 4 May until 29 May, when they reached the Great Barrier Reef north of Australia, the 18 men lived on of bread per day. The weather was often stormy, and they were in constant fear of foundering due to the boat's heavily laden condition. On 29 May they landed on a small island off the coast of Australia, which they named Restoration Island, 29 May 1660 being the date of the restoration of the English monarchy after the English Civil War. Strains were showing within the party; following a heated disagreement with Purcell, Bligh grabbed a cutlass and challenged the carpenter to fight. Fryer told Cole to arrest their captain but backed down after Bligh threatened to kill him if he interfered. Fryer later said Bligh \"was as tyrannical in his temper in the boat as in the ship.\" Over the next week or more they island-hopped north along the Great Barrier reef\u2014while Bligh, cartographer as always, sketched maps of the coast. Early in June they passed through the Endeavour Strait and sailed again on the open sea until they reached Coupang, a settlement on Timor, on 14 June 1789. Despite the hardships he and his men had endured, upon reaching Kupang, Bligh maintained his stubborn adherence to Navy protocol, insisting that a makeshift Union Jack be made up and hoisted and that Fryer remain aboard the launch to guard her. Three of the men who survived this arduous voyage with him were so weak that they soon died of sickness, possibly malaria, in the pestilential Dutch East Indies port of Batavia, the present-day Indonesian capital of Jakarta, as they waited for transport to Britain. Two others died on the way to England.\nPossible causes of the mutiny.\nThe reasons behind the mutiny are still debated; some sources report that Bligh was a tyrant whose abuse of the crew led them to feel that they had no choice but to take over the ship. Other sources argue that Bligh was no worse (and in many cases gentler) than the average captain and naval officer of the era. They also argue that the crew\u2014inexperienced and unused to the rigours of the sea\u2014were corrupted by the freedom, idleness and sexual licence of their five months in Tahiti, finding themselves unwilling to return to the \"Jack Tar's\" life of an ordinary seaman. This view holds that most of the men supported Christian's prideful personal vendetta against Bligh out of a misguided hope that their new captain would return them to Tahiti to live their lives \"hedonistically\" and in peace, free from Bligh's acid tongue and strict discipline.\nThe mutiny is made more mysterious by the friendship of Christian and Bligh, which dates back to Bligh's days in the merchant service. Christian was well acquainted with the Bligh family. As Bligh was being set adrift, he appealed to this friendship, saying \"you have dandled my children upon your knee\". According to Bligh, Christian \"appeared disturbed\" and replied, \"That,\u2014Captain Bligh,\u2014that is the thing;\u2014I am in hell\u2014I am in hell\".\n\"Bounty\"'s log shows that Bligh was relatively sparing in his punishments. He scolded when other captains would have whipped, and whipped when other captains would have hanged. He was an educated man, deeply interested in science, convinced that good diet and sanitation were necessary for the welfare of his crew. He took a great interest in his crew's exercise, was very careful about the quality of their food and insisted upon the \"Bounty\" being kept very clean. The modern historian John Beaglehole has described the major flaw in this otherwise enlightened naval officer: \"[Bligh made] dogmatic judgements which he felt himself entitled to make; he saw fools about him too easily \u2026 thin-skinned vanity was his curse through life \u2026 [Bligh] never learnt that you do not make friends of men by insulting them.\" Bligh was also capable of holding intense grudges against those he thought had betrayed him, such as Midshipman Peter Heywood and ship's gunner William Peckover; in regard to Heywood, Bligh was convinced that the young man was as guilty as Christian. Bligh's first detailed comments on the mutiny are in a letter to his wife Betsy, in which he names Heywood (a mere boy not yet 16) as \"one of the ringleaders\", adding: \"I have now reason to curse the day I ever knew a Christian or a Heywood or indeed a Manks [\"sic\"] man.\" Bligh's later official account to the Admiralty lists Heywood with Christian, Edward Young and George Stewart as the mutiny's leaders, describing Heywood as a young man of abilities for whom he had felt a particular regard. To the Heywood family, Bligh wrote: \"His baseness is beyond all description.\" Peckover applied for a position as gunner on HMS \"Providence\" (the second breadfruit expedition to Tahiti) but was refused by Bligh. In a letter to Sir Joseph Banks, dated 17 July 1791 (two weeks before departure), Bligh wrote:\nShould Peckover my late Gunner ever trouble you to render him further services I shall esteem it a favour if you will tell him I informed you he was a vicious and worthless fellow\u2014He applied to me to render him service &amp; wanted to be appointed Gunner of the Providence but as I had determined never to suffer an officer who was with me in the \"Bounty\" to sail with again, it was for the cause I did not apply for him.\nBligh's refusal to appoint Peckover was partly due to Edward Christian's polemic testimony against Bligh in an effort to clear his brother's name. Christian states in his appendix:\nIn the evidence of Mr. Peckover and Mr. Fryer, it is proved that Mr. Nelson the botanist said, upon hearing the commencement of the mutiny, \"We know whose fault this is, or who is to blame, Mr. Fryer, what have we brought upon ourselves?\" In addition to this, it ought to be known that Mr. Nelson, in conversation afterwards with an officer (Peckover) at Timor, who was speaking of returning with Captain Bligh if he got another ship, observed, \"I am surprized that you should think of going a second time with [Bligh] (using a term of abuse) who has been the cause of all our losses.\"\nPopular fiction often confuses Bligh with Edward Edwards of , who was sent on the Royal Navy's expedition to the South Pacific to find the mutineers and bring them to trial. Edwards is often made out to be the cruel man that Hollywood has portrayed. The 14 men from \"Bounty\" who were captured by Edwards's men were confined in a cramped 18\u2032 \u00d7 11\u2032 \u00d7 5\u20328\u2033 wooden cell on \"Pandora\"'s quarterdeck. Yet, when \"Pandora\" ran aground on the Great Barrier Reef, three prisoners were immediately let out of the prison cell to help at the pumps. Finally, Captain Edwards gave orders to release the other 11 prisoners, to which end Joseph Hodges, the armourer's mate, went into the cell to remove the prisoners' irons. Unfortunately, before he could finish the job, the ship sank. Four of the prisoners and 31 of the crew died during the sinking. More prisoners would likely have perished, had not William Moulter, a bosun's mate, unlocked their cages before jumping off the sinking vessel.\nAftermath.\nIn October 1790, Bligh was honourably acquitted at the court-martial inquiring into the loss of \"Bounty.\" Shortly thereafter, he published \"A Narrative of the Mutiny on board His Majesty's Ship \"Bounty\"; And the Subsequent Voyage of Part of the Crew, In the Ship's Boat, from Tofoa, one of the Friendly Islands, to Timor, a Dutch Settlement in the East Indies.\" Of the 10 surviving prisoners eventually brought home in spite of \"Pandora\"'s loss, four were acquitted, owing to Bligh's testimony that they were non-mutineers that Bligh was obliged to leave on \"Bounty\" because of lack of space in the launch. Two others were convicted because, while not participating in the mutiny, they were passive and did not resist. They subsequently received royal pardons. One was convicted but excused on a technicality. The remaining three were convicted and hanged.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nBligh's letter to his wife, Betsy.\nThe following is a letter to Bligh's wife, written from Coupang, Timor, Dutch East Indies (circa June 1791), in which the first reference to events on the \"Bounty\" is made.\nMy Dear, Dear Betsy,\nI am now, for the most part, in a part of the world I never expected, it is however a place that has afforded me relief and saved my life, and I have the happiness to assure you that I am now in perfect health...\nKnow then my own Dear Betsy, that I have lost the \"Bounty\" ... on the 28\u00a0April at day light in the morning Christian having the morning watch. He with several others came into my Cabin while I was a Sleep, and seizing me, holding naked Bayonets at my Breast, tied my Hands behind my back, and threatened instant destruction if I uttered a word. I however call'd loudly for assistance, but the conspiracy was so well laid that the Officers Cabbin Doors were guarded by Centinels, so Nelson, Peckover, Samuels or the Master could not come to me. I was now dragged on Deck in my Shirt &amp; closely guarded\u2014I demanded of Christian the case of such a violent act, &amp; severely degraded for his Villainy but he could only answer\u2014\"not a word sir or you are Dead.\" I dared him to the act &amp; endeavoured to rally some one to a sense of their duty but to no effect...\nThe Secrisy of this Mutiny is beyond all conception so that I can not discover that any who are with me had the least knowledge of it. It is unbeknown to me why I must beguile such force. Even Mr. Tom Ellison took such a liking to Otaheite [Tahiti] that he also turned Pirate, so that I have been run down by my own Dogs...\nMy misfortune I trust will be properly considered by all the World\u2014It was a circumstance I could not foresee\u2014I had not sufficient Officers &amp; had they granted me Marines most likely the affair would never have happened\u2014I had not a Spirited &amp; brave fellow about me &amp; the Mutineers treated them as such. My conduct has been free of blame, &amp; I showed everyone that, tied as I was, I defied every Villain to hurt me...\nI know how shocked you will be at this affair but I request of you My Dear Betsy to think nothing of it all is now past &amp; we will again looked forward to future happyness. Nothing but true consciousness as an Officer that I have done well could support me...Give my blessings to my Dear Harriet, my Dear Mary, my Dear Betsy &amp; to my Dear little stranger &amp; tell them I shall soon be home...To You my Love I give all that an affectionate Husband can give \u2013\nLove, Respect &amp; all that is or ever will be in the power of your &lt;br&gt;ever affectionate Friend and Husband Wm Bligh.\nStrictly speaking, the crime of the mutineers (apart from the disciplinary crime of mutiny) was not piracy but barratry, the misappropriation by those entrusted with its care of a ship and its contents to the detriment of the owner (in this case the British Crown).\nSecond breadfruit voyage.\nAfter his exoneration by the court-martial inquiry into the loss of \"Bounty\", Bligh remained in the Royal Navy. From 1791 to 1793, as master and commander of and in company with under the command of Nathaniel Portlock, he undertook again to transport breadfruit from Tahiti to the West Indies. He also transported plants provided by Hugh Ronalds, a nurseryman in Brentford. The operation was generally successful but its immediate objective, which was to provide a cheap and nutritious food for the African slaves in the West Indies islands around the Caribbean Sea was not met, as most slaves refused to eat the new food. During this voyage, Bligh also collected samples of the ackee fruit of Jamaica, introducing it to the Royal Society in Britain upon his return. The ackee's scientific name \"Blighia sapida\" in binomial nomenclature was given in honour of Bligh.\nIn Adventure Bay, Tasmania, third lieutenant George Tobin made the first European drawing of an echidna.\nLater life.\nIn February 1797, while Bligh was captain of , he surveyed the Humber estuary, preparing a map of the stretch from Spurn to the west of Sunk Island. In April\u2013May, Bligh was one of the captains whose crews mutinied over \"issues of pay and involuntary service for common seamen\" during the Spithead and Nore mutinies. The mutinies were not triggered by any specific actions by Bligh; the mutinies \"were widespread, [and] involved a fair number of English ships\". Whilst \"Director\"'s role was relatively minor in this episode, she was the last to raise the white flag at its cessation. It was at this time that he learned \"that his common nickname among men in the fleet was 'that Bounty bastard'.\"\nAs captain of \"Director\" at the Battle of Camperdown on 11 October, Bligh engaged three Batavian Navy vessels: \"Haarlem\", \"Alkmaar\" and \"Vrijheid\". While the Batavians suffered serious casualties, only seven seamen were wounded on \"Director\". \"Director\" captured \"Vrijheid\", the flagship of Batavian Vice-Admiral Jan Willem de Winter. For his actions during the battle, Bligh was awarded the Naval Gold Medal.\nBligh went on to serve under Admiral Nelson at the Battle of Copenhagen on 2 April 1801, in command of , a 56-gun ship of the line, which was experimentally fitted exclusively with carronades. After the battle, Nelson personally praised Bligh for his contribution to the victory. He sailed \"Glatton\" safely between the banks while three other vessels ran aground. When Nelson ignored Admiral Parker's signal \"43\" (stop the battle) and kept the signal \"16\" hoisted to continue the engagement, Bligh was the only captain in the squadron who could see that the two signals were in conflict. By choosing to fly Nelson's signal, he ensured that all the vessels behind him kept fighting.\nBligh was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in May 1801 for distinguished services in navigation, botany, etc.\nGovernor of New South Wales.\nBligh had gained a reputation as a firm disciplinarian. Accordingly, he was offered the position of Governor of New South Wales on the recommendation of Sir Joseph Banks (President of the Royal Society and a main sponsor of the breadfruit expeditions) and appointed in March 1805, at \u00a32,000 per annum (equal to \u00a3 today), twice the pay of the retiring governor, Philip Gidley King. He arrived in Sydney on 6 August 1806, to become the fourth governor. As his wife Elizabeth had been unwilling to undertake a long sea voyage, Bligh was accompanied by his daughter, Mary Putland, who would be the Lady of Government House; Mary's husband John Putland was appointed as William Bligh's aide-de-camp. During his time in Sydney, his confrontational administrative style provoked the wrath of influential settlers and officials. They included the wealthy landowner and businessman John Macarthur, and prominent Crown representatives such as the colony's principal surgeon, Thomas Jamison, as well as senior officers of the New South Wales Corps. Jamison and his military associates were defying government regulations by engaging in private trading ventures for profit, a practice that Bligh was determined to end.\nThe conflict between Bligh and the entrenched colonists culminated in another mutiny, the Rum Rebellion, when, on 26 January 1808, 400 soldiers of the New South Wales Corps under the command of Major George Johnston marched on Government House in Sydney to arrest Bligh. A petition written by John Macarthur and addressed to George Johnston was written on the day of the arrest but most of the 151 signatures were gathered in the days after Bligh's overthrow. A rebel government was subsequently installed and Bligh, now deposed, made for Hobart in Tasmania aboard . Bligh failed to gain support from the authorities in Hobart to retake control of New South Wales, and remained effectively imprisoned on the \"Porpoise\" from 1808 until January 1810.\nShortly after Bligh's arrest, a watercolour illustrating the arrest by an unknown artist was exhibited in Sydney at perhaps Australia's first public art exhibition. The watercolour depicts a soldier dragging Bligh from underneath one of the servants' beds in Government House, with two other figures standing by. The two soldiers in the watercolour are most likely John Sutherland and Michael Marlborough and the other figure on the far right is believed to represent Lieutenant William Minchin. This cartoon is Australia's earliest surviving political cartoon and like all political cartoons it makes use of caricature and exaggeration to convey its message. The New South Wales Corps' officers regarded themselves as gentlemen, and in depicting Bligh as a coward, the cartoon declares that Bligh was not a gentleman and therefore not fit to govern.\nOf interest, however, was Bligh's concern for the more recently arrived settlers in the colony, who did not have the wealth and influence of Macarthur and Jamison. From the tombstones in Ebenezer and Richmond cemeteries, (areas being settled west of Sydney during Bligh's tenure as governor), can be seen the number of boys born around 1807 to 1811 who received \"William Bligh\" as a given name, e.g. William Bligh Turnbull, ancestor of former Prime Minister of Australia, Malcolm Bligh Turnbull; and James Bligh Johnston, who designed Ebenezer Chapel, Australia's oldest extant church and oldest extant school.\nAftermath of the Rum Rebellion.\nBligh received a letter in January 1810, advising him that the rebellion had been declared illegal, and that the British Foreign Office had declared it to be a mutiny. Lachlan Macquarie had been appointed to replace him as governor. At this news Bligh sailed from Hobart. He arrived in Sydney on 17 January 1810, only two weeks into Macquarie's tenure. There he would collect evidence for the coming court martial in England of Major Johnston. He departed to attend the trial on 12 May 1810, arriving on 25 October 1810. In the days immediately prior to their departure, his daughter, Mary Putland (widowed in 1808), was hastily married to the new Lieutenant-Governor, Maurice Charles O'Connell, and remained in Sydney. The following year, the trial's presiding officers sentenced Johnston to be cashiered, a form of disgraceful dismissal that entailed surrendering his commission in the Royal Marines without compensation. (This was a comparatively mild punishment that enabled Johnston to return a free man to New South Wales, where he could continue to enjoy the benefits of his accumulated private wealth.) Bligh was court martialled twice again during his career, being acquitted both times. Soon after Johnston's trial had concluded, Bligh received a backdated promotion to rear admiral. In 1814, he was promoted again to vice-admiral of the blue. Perhaps significantly, he never again received an important command, though with the Napoleonic Wars almost over there would have been few fleet commands available.\nFinal years and death.\nBligh was recruited to chart and map Dublin Bay, and recommended the building walls for a refuge harbour at what was then known as Dunleary; the large harbour and naval base subsequently built there between 1816 and 1821 was called Kingstown, later renamed D\u00fan Laoghaire. Many sources claim that Bligh designed the North Bull Wall at the mouth of the River Liffey in Dublin. He did propose the construction of a sea wall or barrier at the north of the bay in order to clear a sandbar by Venturi action, but his design was not used. The wall that was constructed used a design by George Halpin and resulted in the formation of North Bull Island by the sand cleared by the river's now more narrowly focused force.\nBligh died of cancer in Bond Street, London, on 7 December 1817 and was buried in a family plot at St. Mary's, Lambeth (this church is now the Garden Museum). His tomb was notable for its use of Coade stone (\"Lithodipyra\"), a compound of clay and other materials that was moulded in imitation of carved stonework and fired in a kiln. This stoneware was produced by Eleanor Coade at her factory in Lambeth. The tomb is topped by an eternal flame, not a breadfruit. A plaque marks Bligh's house, half a mile (700m) east of the Garden Museum at 100 Lambeth Road, opposite the Imperial War Museum.\nHe was related to Admiral Sir Richard Rodney Bligh and Captain George Miller Bligh, and his British and Australian descendants include Native Police Commandant John O'Connell Bligh and the former Premier of Queensland, Anna Bligh. He was also distantly related to the architect and psychical researcher Frederick Bligh Bond.\nThe New South Wales suburb of Bligh Park\u00a0is named after William Bligh, as at the time of the\u00a0Rum Rebellion, the Hawkesbury settlers supported the then-deposed governor.\nLegacy.\nBligh's reputation as the archetypal bad commander remains though several historians' attempts to portray Bligh more sympathetically are those of Richard Hough (1972) and Caroline Alexander (2003).\nBligh's logbooks documenting the mutiny were inscribed on the UNESCO Australian Memory of the World register on 26 February 2021.\nPortrayals.\nBligh has been the subject of numerous print and film portrayals.\nFilm.\nBligh was portrayed by:\nThe 1935 and 1962 films largely perpetuate the image of Bligh as a tyrant while the 1984 film attempts a non-judgmental portrayal of Bligh.\nLiterature.\nBligh is humorously portrayed in Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch's short story \"Frenchman's Creek\" as a competent but irascible and tactless surveyor sent to a small fishing village in Cornwall during the Napoleonic Wars. His accent and strong language being misunderstood by the locals as French, he is temporarily imprisoned as a spy.\nThe situation in Sydney in 1810, with Bligh returning from Tasmania to be restored as governor, is the setting of Naomi Novik's fantasy novel \"Tongues of Serpents\" (Harper-Collins, 2011).\nTelevision.\nOn 17 December 1964, the \"Adobe Dick\" episode of the cartoon \"The Flintstones\" (episode 128) paid a humorous homage to Captain Bligh and his ship. On the show, the characters Fred and Barney took a chartered fishing trip with the guys from the lodge on the U.S.S. \"Bountystone\". The captain of the ship, Captain Blah, was a domineering man with a uniform resembling the historical figure William Bligh.\n\"Mutiny\", on Channel 4 in the UK, charts a recreation of Bligh's journey to Timor. It aired in 2017.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nManuscript sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDigitised versions of Bligh's logbooks are available on the Library's website. \nExternal links.\nOnline works"}

He first came to prominence in the 1950s as a novelist before turning to screenwriting. Among other accolades, Goldman won two\u00a0Academy Awards\u00a0in both writing categories: first for\u00a0Best Original Screenplay for \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" (1969)\u00a0and then for\u00a0Best Adapted Screenplay for \"All the President's Men\" (1976).\nHis other well-known works include his thriller novel \"Marathon Man\" (1974) and his cult classic comedy/fantasy novel \"The Princess Bride\" (1973), both of which he also adapted for film versions.\nEarly life.\nGoldman was born in Chicago on August 12, 1931, the second son of Marion (n\u00e9e\u00a0Weil) (1904 - 1993) and Maurice Clarence Goldman (1893 - 1947). He grew up in Highland Park, Illinois, and was raised Jewish. Goldman's father was a successful businessman, working in Chicago and in a partnership, but he suffered from alcoholism, which cost him his business. He \"came home to live and he was in his pajamas for the last five years of his life,\" according to Goldman. His father died by suicide while Goldman was still in high school. It was a 15-year-old Goldman who discovered the body. His mother was deaf, which created additional stress in the home.\nEducation and military service.\nGoldman attended Oberlin College in Oberlin, Ohio. According to his memoir \"Adventures in the Screen Trade\" (1983), Goldman began to write when he took a creative-writing course in college. His grades in the class were \"horrible\". He was an editor of Oberlin's literary magazine. He submitted his short stories to the magazine anonymously; he recalls that the other editors read his submissions and remarked, \"We can't possibly publish this shit.\" He graduated from college in 1952.\nAt that time, the Korean War was occurring, so he was drafted into the U.S. Army shortly thereafter. Because he knew how to type, he was assigned as a clerk in the Pentagon, Defense headquarters. He was discharged with the rank of corporal in September 1954. He returned to graduate studies under the GI Bill, earning a Master of Arts degree at Columbia University, graduating in 1956. Throughout this period, he was writing short stories in the evenings, but struggled to have them published.\nCareer.\nNovelist.\nGoldman did not originally intend to become a screenwriter. His main interests were poetry, short stories, and novels. In 1956, he completed a master's thesis at Columbia University on the comedy of manners in America.\nHis older brother James Goldman was a playwright and screenwriter. They shared an apartment in New York with their friend John Kander. Also an alumnus of Oberlin, Kander was working on his Ph.D. in music, and the Goldman brothers wrote the libretto for his dissertation. Kander was the composer of more than a dozen musicals, including \"Cabaret\" and \"Chicago\", and all three of them eventually won Academy Awards. On June 25, 1956, Goldman began writing his first novel \"The Temple of Gold\", completing it in less than three weeks. He sent the manuscript to agent Joe McCrindle, who agreed to represent him; McCrindle submitted the novel to Knopf, who agreed to publish it if he doubled the length. It sold well enough in paperback to launch Goldman on his career. He wrote his second novel \"Your Turn to Curtsy, My Turn to Bow\" (1958) in a little more than a week. It was followed by \"Soldier in the Rain\" (1960), based on Goldman's time in the military. It sold well in paperback and was turned into a film, though Goldman had no involvement in the screenplay.\nTheater work.\nGoldman and his brother received a grant to do some rewriting on the musical \"Tenderloin\" (1960). They then collaborated on their own play, \"Blood, Sweat and Stanley Poole\" (1961), and on the musical, \"A Family Affair\" (1962), written with John Kander. Both plays had short runs.\nGoldman began writing \"Boys and Girls Together\", but found that he suffered writer's block. His writer's block continued, but he had an idea for the novel \"No Way to Treat a Lady\" (1964) based on the Boston Strangler. He wrote it in two weeks, and it was published under the pseudonym Harry Longbaugh\u2014a variant spelling of the Sundance Kid's real name, which Goldman had been researching since the late 1950s. He then finished \"Boys and Girls Together\", which became a best seller.\nScreenwriter.\nCliff Robertson read an early draft of \"No Way to Treat a Lady\" and hired Goldman to adapt the short story \"Flowers for Algernon\" for the movies. Before he had even finished the script, Robertson recommended him to do some rewriting on the spy spoof \"Masquerade\" (1965), in which Robertson was starring. Goldman did that, then finished the \"Algernon\" script. Robertson disliked it, though, and hired Stirling Silliphant, instead, to work on what became \"Charly\" (1968).\nProducer Elliot Kastner had optioned the film rights to \"Boys and Girls Together\". Goldman suggested that Kastner make a film of the Lew Archer novels of Ross Macdonald and offered to do an adaptation. Kastner agreed, and Goldman chose \"The Moving Target\". The result was \"Harper\" (1966) starring Paul Newman, which was a big hit.\n\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\".\nGoldman returned to novels, writing \"The Thing of It Is...\" (1967). He taught at Princeton and wished to write something, but he could not come up with an idea for a novel. Instead, he wrote \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\", his first original screenplay, which he had been researching for eight years. He sold it for $400,000, the highest price ever paid for an original screenplay at that time. The movie was released in 1969, a critical and commercial success that earned Goldman an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. The money enabled Goldman to take some time off and research the nonfiction \"\" (1969).\nGoldman adapted Steven Linakis's novel \"In the Spring the War Ended\" into a screenplay, but it was not filmed. Neither were scripts of \"The Thing of It Is\", which came close to being made several times in the early '70s, and \"Papillon\", on which he worked for six months and three drafts; the book was filmed, but little of Goldman's work was used. He returned to novels with \"Father's Day\" (1971), a sequel to \"The Thing of It Is\u2026\". He also wrote the screenplay for \"The Hot Rock\" (1972).\n\"The Princess Bride\".\nGoldman's next novel was \"The Princess Bride\" (1973); he also wrote a screenplay, but it was more than a decade before the film was made. That same year, he contracted a rare strain of pneumonia, which resulted in his being hospitalized and affected his health for months. This inspired him into a burst of creativity, including several novels and screenplays.\nGoldman's novel writing moved in a more commercial direction following the death of his editor Hiram Haydn in late 1973. This started with the children's book \"Wigger\" (1974), followed by the thriller \"Marathon Man\" (1974), which he sold to Delacorte as part of a three-book deal worth $2\u00a0million. He sold movie rights to \"Marathon Man\" for $450,000.\nHis second book for Delacorte was the thriller \"Magic\" (1976), which he sold to Joe Levine for $1\u00a0million. He did the screenplays for the film versions of \"Marathon Man\" (1976) and \"Magic\" (1978). He also wrote the screenplay for \"The Stepford Wives\" (1975), which he says was an unpleasant experience because director Bryan Forbes rewrote most of it; Goldman tried to take his name off it, but they would not let him. He was reunited with director George Roy Hill and star Robert Redford on \"The Great Waldo Pepper\" (1975), which Goldman wrote from an idea of Hill.\n\"All the President's Men\".\nRedford hired Goldman to write the script of \"All the President's Men\" (1976).\nGoldman wrote the famous line \"Follow the money\" for the screenplay of \"All the President's Men\"; while the line is often attributed to Deep Throat, it is not found in Bob Woodward's notes nor in Woodward and Carl Bernstein's book or articles. The book does have the far less-quotable line from Woodward to Senator Sam Ervin, who was about to begin his own investigation: \"The key was the secret campaign cash, and it should all be traced...\"\nGoldman was unhappy with the movie. \"The Guardian\" says that he changes the subject when asked about the movie, but suggests that his displeasure may be because he was pressured to add a romantic interest to the film. In his memoir, Goldman says of the film that if he could live his life over, he would have written the same screenplays, \"Only I wouldn't have come near \"All the President's Men\".\" He said that he has never written as many versions of a screenplay as he did for that movie. Speaking of his choice to write the script, he said: \"Many movies that get made are not long on art and are long on commerce. This was a project that seemed it might be both. You don't get many and you can't turn them down.\"\nIn Michael Feeney Callan's book \"Robert Redford: The Biography\", Redford is reported as stating that Goldman did not actually write the screenplay for the movie, a story that was excerpted in \"Vanity Fair\". \"Written By\" magazine conducted a thorough investigation of the screenplay's many drafts and concluded, \"Goldman was the sole author of \"All The President's Men\". Period.\"\nJoseph E. Levine.\nGoldman had a happier experience when hired by Joseph E. Levine to write \"A Bridge Too Far\" (1977) based on the book by Cornelius Ryan. Goldman later wrote a promotional book, \"Story of A Bridge Too Far\" (1977), as a favor to Levine, and signed a three-film contract with the producer worth $1.5\u00a0million.\nHe wrote a novel about Hollywood, \"Tinsel\" (1979), which sold well. He wrote two more films for Levine, \"The Sea Kings\" and \"Year of the Comet\", but did not write a third. He did a script about Tom Horn; \"Mr. Horn\" (1979), was filmed for TV.\nGoldman was the original screenwriter for the film version of Tom Wolfe's novel \"The Right Stuff\"; director Philip Kaufman wrote his own screenplay without using Goldman's material, because Kaufman wanted to include Chuck Yeager as a character; Goldman did not.\nHe wrote a number of other screenplays around this time, including \"The Ski Bum\"; a musical adaptation of \"Grand Hotel\" (1932) that was going to be directed by Norman Jewison; and \"Rescue\", the story of the rescue of Electronic Data Systems employees during the Iranian Revolution. None were made into films.\n\"Adventures in the Screen Trade\" and the \"Leper Period\".\nAfter several of his screenplays were not filmed, Goldman found himself in less demand as a screenwriter. He published a memoir about his professional life in Hollywood, \"Adventures in the Screen Trade\" (1983), which summed up the entertainment industry in the opening sentence of the book, \"Nobody knows anything.\"\nHe focused on novels: \"Control\" (1982), \"The Silent Gondoliers\" (1983), \"The Color of Light\" (1984), \"Heat\" (1985), and \"Brothers\" (1986). The last, a sequel to \"Marathon Man\", was Goldman's last published novel.\nReturn to Hollywood.\nGoldman attributed his return to Hollywood to signing with talent agent Michael Ovitz at Creative Artists Agency. He went to work on \"Memoirs of an Invisible Man\", although he left the project relatively early.\nHollywood's interest in Goldman was reawakened; he wrote the scripts for film versions of \"Heat\" (1986) and \"The Princess Bride\" (1987). The latter was directed by Rob Reiner for Castle Rock, which hired Goldman to write the screenplay for Rob Reiner's 1990 adaptation of Stephen King's novel \"Misery\", considered \"one of [King's] least adaptable novels\". The movie, for which Kathy Bates received an Academy Award, performed well with critics and at the box office.\nGoldman continued to write nonfiction regularly. He published a collection of sports writing, \"Wait Till Next Year\" (1988) and an account of his time as a judge at both the Cannes Film Festival and the Miss America Pageant, \"Hype and Glory\" (1990).\nGoldman began to work steadily as a \"script doctor\", doing uncredited work on films including \"Twins\" (1988), \"A Few Good Men\" (1992), \"Indecent Proposal\" (1993), \"Last Action Hero\" (1993), \"Malice\" (1994), \"Dolores Claiborne\" (1995), and \"Extreme Measures\". Most of these movies were by Castle Rock.\nHe was credited on several other movies: \"Year of the Comet\" (1992), which was eventually filmed by Castle Rock, but was not a success; the biopic \"Chaplin\" (1992), directed by Richard Attenborough; \"Maverick\" (1994), a popular hit; \"The Chamber\" (1996), from a novel by John Grisham; \"The Ghost and the Darkness\" (1996), an original script based on a true story; \"Absolute Power\" (1997) for Clint Eastwood; and \"The General's Daughter\" (1999), from the novel by Nelson DeMille.\nLater career.\nGoldman wrote another volume of memoirs, \"Which Lie Did I Tell?\" (2000), and a collection of his essays, \"\" (2001).\nHis later screenplay credits include \"Hearts in Atlantis\" (2001) and \"Dreamcatcher\" (2003), both from novels by Stephen King. He adapted \"Misery\" into a stage play, which made its debut on Broadway in 2015 in a production starring Bruce Willis and Laurie Metcalf.\nHis script for \"Heat\" was filmed again as \"Wild Card\" (2015), starring Jason Statham.\nAfter his death, screenwriter Peter Morgan wrote that Goldman had completed a final book on Hollywood, comparing the production of three different films, including Morgan's Frost/Nixon, but that the book had run into legal problems and was never published. Writers Tony Gilroy and Scott Frank said Goldman spent considerable time mentoring and advising other writers.\nCritical reception.\nIn their feature on Goldman, \"IGN\" said, \"It's a testament to just how truly great William Goldman is at his best that I actually had to think hard about what to select as his 'Must-See' cinematic work\". The site described his script for \"All the President's Men\" as a \"model of storytelling clarity... and artful manipulation\".\nArt Kleiner, writing in 1987, said, \"William Goldman, a very skilled storyteller, wrote several of the most well-known films of the past 18 years\u2014including \"Marathon Man\", part of \"All the President's Men\", and \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\".\" \nThree of Goldman's scripts have been voted into the Writers Guild of America hall-of-fame's 101 Greatest Screenplays list.\nIn his book evaluating Goldman's work, \"William Goldman: The Reluctant Storyteller\" (2014), Sean Egan said Goldman's achievements were made \"without ever lunging for the lowest common denominator. Although his body of work has been consumed by millions, he has never let his populism overwhelm a glittering intelligence and penchant for upending expectation.\"\nSelf-appraisal.\nIn 2000, Goldman said of his writing:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Someone pointed out to me that the most sympathetic characters in my books always died miserably. I didn't consciously know I was doing that. I didn't. I mean, I didn't wake up each morning and think, today I think I'll make a really terrific guy \"so I can kill him\". It just worked out that way. I haven't written a novel in over a decade... and someone very wise suggested that I might have stopped writing novels because my rage was gone. It's possible. All this doesn't mean a helluva lot, except probably there is a reason I was the guy who gave Babe over to Szell in the \"Is it safe?\" scene and that I was the guy who put Westley into The Machine. I think I have a way with pain. When I come to that kind of sequence I have a certain confidence that I can make it play. Because I come from such a dark corner.\nGoldman also said of his work:\n\"I [don't] like my writing. I wrote a movie called \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" and I wrote a novel called \"The Princess Bride\" and those are the only two things I've ever written, not that I'm proud of, but that I can look at without humiliation.\"\nAwards.\nHe won two Academy Awards: one for Best Original Screenplay for \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\", and Best Adapted Screenplay for \"All the President's Men\". He also won two Edgar Awards, from the Mystery Writers of America, for Best Motion Picture Screenplay: for \"Harper\" in 1967, and for \"Magic\" (adapted from his 1976 novel) in 1979. In 1985, he received the Laurel Award for Screenwriting Achievement from the Writers Guild of America.\nPersonal life.\nHe was married to Ilene Jones from 1961 until their divorce in 1991; the couple had two daughters, Jenny Rebecca (b. 1962) and Susanna (b 1965). Ilene, a native of Texas, modeled for Neiman Marcus; Ilene's brother was actor Allen Case.\nGoldman was survived by his partner of nineteen years, Susan Burden, his daughter Jenny, and a grandson. His daughter Susanna died on 15 January 2015.\nGoldman said that his favorite writers were Miguel de Cervantes, Anton Chekhov, W. Somerset Maugham, Irwin Shaw, and Leo Tolstoy.\nHe was a die-hard fan of the New York Knicks, having held season tickets at Madison Square Garden for over 40 years. He contributed a writing section to Bill Simmons's bestselling book about the history of the NBA, in which he discussed the career of Dave DeBusschere.\nSince his death his collection of personal books is managed by INKQ Rare Books in Addison, Texas.\nDeath.\nGoldman died at his Manhattan apartment on November 16, 2018, due to colon cancer complicated by pneumonia.

He is known for playing Vizzini in \"The Princess Bride\" (1987), Mr. Hall in \"Clueless\" (1995), Dr. John Sturgis in \"Young Sheldon\" (2018\u20132024), and voicing Rex in the \"Toy Story\" franchise (1995\u2013present).\nShawn also appeared in \"The Bostonians\" (1984), \"Prick Up Your Ears\" (1987), \"Scenes from the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills\" (1989), \"Vanya on 42nd Street\" (1994), \"My Favorite Martian\" (1999), \"The Double\" (2013), \"Maggie's Plan\" (2015), and \"Marriage Story\" (2019). He appeared in six Woody Allen films including \"Manhattan\" (1979), \"Radio Days\" (1987), and \"Rifkin's Festival\" (2020). His television work includes recurring roles as Jeff Engels in \"The Cosby Show\" (1987\u20131991), Grand Nagus Zek in \"\" (1993\u20131999), Cyrus Rose in \"Gossip Girl\" (2008\u20132012), and Father Frank Ignatius in \"Evil\" (2022\u20132024).\nShawn is also a playwright; his plays include the Obie Award\u2013winning \"Aunt Dan and Lemon\" (1985), \"The Designated Mourner\" (1996) and \"Grasses of a Thousand Colors\" (2008). He wrote and starred, with Andre Gregory, in the 1981 avant-garde drama \"My Dinner with Andre,\" and played the title role in \"A Master Builder\" (2013), a film adaptation of Henrik Ibsen's play. Haymarket Books published his books \"Essays\" (2009) and \"Night Thoughts\" (2017).\nEarly life and education.\nShawn was born on November 12, 1943, in New York City, to a Jewish family. His parents were journalist Cecille (n\u00e9e Lyon) and William Shawn, the longtime editor of \"The New Yorker\". He has younger twin siblings: composer Allen Shawn, and Mary, who is autistic and lives in an institution. His father's family had emigrated from Central Europe; his paternal grandfather, Benjamin W. Chon, was a Chicago-based cutlery merchant who married Anna Bransky.\nShawn grew up on Manhattan's Upper East Side. He attended The Collegiate School on Manhattan's West Side before transferring to The Putney School, a private liberal arts high school in Putney, Vermont. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in history from Harvard College. He studied philosophy, politics and economics, as well as Latin, at Magdalen College, Oxford, originally intending to become a diplomat. He traveled to India as an English teacher on a Fulbright program.\nCareer.\nPlaywright.\nShawn's early plays, such as \"Marie and Bruce\" (1978), portrayed emotional and sexual conflicts in an absurdist style, with language both lyrical and violent. In a conversation with Andre Gregory, parts of which were used to create \"My Dinner with Andre\", Shawn said these plays depicted \"my interior life as a raging beast.\" Critical response was extremely polarized: some critics hailed Shawn as a major writer, while John Simon called \"Marie and Bruce\" \"garbage\" and Shawn \"one of the unsightliest actors in this city.\" His 1977 play \"A Thought in Three Parts\" caused controversy in London when the production was investigated by a vice squad and attacked in Parliament after allegations of pornographic content. Shawn received an Obie Award for playwrighting in 1975, for \"Our Late Night\".\nShawn's later plays are more overtly political, drawing parallels between his characters' psychology and the behavior of governments and social classes. Among the best-known of these are \"Aunt Dan and Lemon\" (1985) and \"The Designated Mourner\" (1997). Shawn's political work has invited controversy, as he often presents the audience with several contradictory points of view. He has called \"Aunt Dan and Lemon\" a cautionary tale against fascism. Shawn's monologue \"The Fever\", originally meant to be performed for small audiences in apartments, depicts a person who becomes sick while struggling to find a morally consistent way to live when faced with injustice, and harshly criticizes the United States' record in supporting oppressive anti-communist regimes. In 1997, Shawn discussed the political nature of \"Aunt Dan and Lemon\", \"The Fever\" and \"The Designated Mourner\" in an interview in which he talked extensively about the thematic connections among them, as well as his own views on Marxist, communist and socialist politics, their relevance to American liberalism, and how governmental and individual responsibilities for finding solutions to the dichotomy between rich and poor in the world take hold in his characters. \"Aunt Dan and Lemon\" earned Shawn his second Obie Award for playwrighting in 1986, and \"The Fever\" won an Obie for Best American Play in 1991. Three of Shawn's plays have been adapted into films: \"The Designated Mourner\" (basically a film version of David Hare's stage production), \"Marie and Bruce\" and \"The Fever\". Vanessa Redgrave stars in \"The Fever\" (2004), which first aired on HBO on June 13, 2007.\nShawn has also written political commentary for \"The Nation\", and in 2004 he published the one-issue-only progressive political magazine \"Final Edition\", which featured interviews with and articles by Jonathan Schell, Noam Chomsky, Mark Strand and Deborah Eisenberg. Shawn is credited as translator of Bertolt Brecht's \"The Threepenny Opera\", which opened at Studio 54 in Manhattan on March 25, 2006. He appeared briefly in voiceover during \"Song about the Futility of Human Endeavor\". He published his first nonfiction work, \"Essays\", on September 1, 2009. It is a collection of essays that express his perceptions of politics and other aspects of his life.\nActing.\nShawn's involvement with theater began in 1970 when he met Andre Gregory, who has since directed several of his plays. As a stage actor, he has appeared mostly in his own plays and other projects with Gregory. He made his film debut in 1979, playing Diane Keaton's ex-husband in Woody Allen's \"Manhattan\" and an insurance agent in Bob Fosse's \"All That Jazz\". His best-known film roles include Earl in \"Strange Invaders\" (1983) and Mr. Hall in \"Clueless\" (1995). After seeing his performance in \"My Dinner with Andre\" (1981), casting director Janet Hirshenson was so fond of his delivery of the word \"inconceivable\" that she cast him as Vizzini in \"The Princess Bride\" (1987), for whom the word is a catchphrase. Other roles include Baron Von Westphalen in \"Southland Tales\", Cyrus Rose on \"Gossip Girl\", Marty in \"Vegas Vacation\" (1997), and Ezra in \"The Haunted Mansion\" (2003).\nHis rare non-comedic film roles include two collaborations with Andre Gregory and Louis Malle: the semi-autobiographical dialogue \"My Dinner with Andre\", and a combined production-and-backstage-drama of \"Uncle Vanya\" titled \"Vanya on 42nd Street\". Shawn quite often appears on television, where he has appeared in many genres and series. He has had recurring roles as the Grand Nagus Zek on \"\", Stuart Best on \"Murphy Brown\", Jeff Engels on \"The Cosby Show\", Dr. Howard Stiles on \"Crossing Jordan\", Arnie Ross on \"Taxi\", Charles Lester on both \"The Good Wife\" and \"The Good Fight\", a reprisal of his role as Mr. Hall on \"Clueless\" (based on the film), and Father Frank Ignatius on \"Evil\". He appeared in the 1985 music video for Chaka Khan's \"This Is My Night\". On February 4, 2010, Shawn appeared as Alan Rubin on \"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart\". \"A Master Builder\" opened in New York City in June 2014. In 2018, he joined the cast of \"Young Sheldon\" in the recurring role of Meemaw's boyfriend and Sheldon's physics professor, Dr. John Sturgis.\nShawn stars in Woody Allen's 2020 film \"Rifkin's Festival\", set in San Sebastian, Spain.\nShawn was honored in 2005 with the PEN/Laura Pels International Foundation for Theater Award as a Master American Dramatist.\nVoice acting.\nShawn is a voice actor for animated films and television series, including the \"Toy Story\" franchise, \"Monsters, Inc.\" (during the outtakes in the closing credits), \"Kingdom Hearts III\", \"The Incredibles\", \"A Goofy Movie\", \"Family Guy\", \"Happily N'Ever After\", \"\", \"Regular Show\", \"BoJack Horseman\" and \"Animal Crackers\".\nShawn said that \"Toy Story\" director John Lasseter might have seen both \"My Dinner with Andre\" and \"The Princess Bride\" and seen him as \"excitable\" like Shawn's character, Rex.\nIn \"The Fox and the Hound\", Shawn was originally to voice Boomer, but dropped out and was replaced by Paul Winchell. In \"\", he replaced Jon Lovitz as the voice of Calico. He also provided the voice of Mr. Mustela in \"The Addams Family 2\".\nPolitical activity.\nShawn has written many plays with socialist themes; much of his work examines the \"connective tissue between private psychology and the politics of inequality\". He identifies as a socialist in the essay \"Why I Call Myself a Socialist: Is the World Really a Stage?\", which was published online and later in his \"Essays\".\nIn June 2013, Shawn and many other public figures appeared in a video showing support for Chelsea Manning, a U.S. Army soldier imprisoned for leaking classified material.\nShawn voiced his support for the Palestinian people during the 2014 Gaza War. He has been on the advisory board of Jewish Voice for Peace.\nOn October 16, 2023, Shawn spoke at a Washington D.C. rally organized by Jewish Voice for Peace and IfNotNow. The rally called for a ceasefire in the Gaza war and for President Joe Biden to support a ceasefire. Also that month, Shawn was among the artists to sign the Artists4Ceasefire campaign's open letter urging Biden to push for a ceasefire.\nIn April 2024, Shawn narrated a political ad by a group of organizations opposing the American Israel Public Affairs Committee's influence in Democratic Party primaries.\nIn a January 2025 interview, Shawn compared Israel to Nazi Germany, saying the Israelis were \"doing evil that is just as great as what the Nazis did. And in some ways, it's worse, because they kind of boast about it. Hitler had the decency to try to keep it secret... the Israelis are almost proud of it, and it's demonically evil.\"\nPersonal life.\nShawn's longtime companion is writer Deborah Eisenberg. Shawn is a Jewish atheist. As of 2012[ [update]], he lived in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They invented nonsensical free verse poetry and submitted it to the paper in Ashbless's name, where it was reportedly enthusiastically accepted.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The college paper printed poetry, and it was close enough to the '60s that the poetry was all just horrible free verse about children and flowers and rainbows. So we figured we could write poetry that would sound very portentous but be, in fact, meaningless. ... We needed a name for our poet and [came up with] \"Ashbless\". The paper published them, so we wrote another lot that was dumber, and they published that. ... We said [Ashbless] was hideously deformed and couldn't attend any readings or meetings, but he had given us these poems to read in his stead. ... Blaylock and I would often break out laughing in the middle of reading them, which people thought was very insensitive of us, to be laughing at the poetical efforts of our deformed friend.\u2014\u200a\nAs a character.\nAshbless is, however, best known in his incarnation as a 19th-century poet, in which guise he appears in Powers' \"The Anubis Gates\" (1983) and as a lesser character in Blaylock's \"The Digging Leviathan\" (1984). Neither author was aware that the other's novel contained a William Ashbless until the coincidence was noticed by the editor responsible for both books, who suggested that the two consult one another so that their references would be consistent. Ashbless also features (as Sir William Ashbless) in Powers' 1979 novel \"The Drawing of the Dark\", credited with a brief quote before the book's prologue:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If but we Christians have our beer,\n Nothing's to fear.\nIn his 1992 novel \"Last Call\" (), Tim Powers includes a poem attributed to William Ashbless in the introduction to Book One. The poem is \"from\" a later time period, as it mentions airplanes, cars, and blue jeans.\nPowers' novel \"On Stranger Tides\" opens with an excerpt from a poem by William Ashbless, implying that the novel's name is in reference to the poem:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...And unmoor'd souls may drift on stranger tides \nThan those men know of, and be overthrown\nBy winds that would not even stir a hair...\nAs a supposed writer.\nIn 1985, Powers and Blaylock produced \"Offering the Bicentennial Edition of the Complete Twelve Hours of the Night: 1785\u20131985\", a prospectus for a non-existent collection of Ashbless poetry, published by Cheap Street Press. (\"The Twelve Hours of the Night\" had been mentioned in \"The Anubis Gates\" as Ashbless's most famous work.) The prospectus included a sample poem and a replica of Ashbless's signature (the \"William\" was signed by one, and the \"Ashbless\" by the other, of the authors). This was followed in 2001 by \"On Pirates\" ()\u2014supposedly written by Ashbless, with an introduction by Powers, an afterword by Blaylock, and illustrations by Gahan Wilson\u2014and in 2002 by \"The William Ashbless Memorial Cookbook\".\nBlog.\nIn 2017, Big Hit Entertainment, the label behind K-Pop group BTS, created a blog post on Naver that mentions Ashbless as a character. The blog post tells the fictional story of Ashbless as a 16th-century poet and playing card enthusiast who created a special card known as The Flower. The blog adds details to Ashbless' life in order to flesh out the narrative surrounding some of BTS' concepts. The post was deleted and then re-uploaded in 2018 to further support themes of time travel in BTS' fictional universe.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "33908", "revid": "46889628", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33908", "title": "Why We Fight", "text": "Series of films to motivate US soldiers during World War II\nWhy We Fight is a series of seven propaganda films produced by the US Department of War from 1942 to 1945, during World War II. It was originally written for American soldiers to help them understand why the United States was involved in the war, but US President Franklin Roosevelt ordered distribution for public viewing.\nAcademy Award-winning filmmaker Frank Capra, daunted but impressed and challenged by Leni Riefenstahl's 1935 propaganda film \"Triumph of the Will\", worked in direct response. The series faced various challenges, such as convincing a noninterventionist nation to get involved in the war and to become an ally of the Soviet Union. Many entries feature Axis powers' propaganda footage from up to 20 years earlier, recontextualized to promote the Allies.\nAlthough primarily edited by William Hornbeck, some parts were re-enacted \"under War Department supervision\" if no relevant footage was available. Animated segments were produced by Walt Disney Productions, and the animated maps followed a convention of depicting Axis-occupied territory in black. In 2000, the US Library of Congress deemed the films \"culturally significant\" and selected them for preservation in the National Film Registry.\nPurpose.\nAfter the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 and America's subsequent joining World War II, American film director Frank Capra enlisted with the armed forces. He was already an established Hollywood director responsible for directing Academy Award-winning films such as \"It Happened One Night\" (1934) and \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" (1939). He was assigned to work directly under George Marshall, the Chief of Staff of the United States Army. Marshall felt that the Signal Corps, an army branch responsible for communications, was incapable of producing \"sensitive and objective troop information films\". One colonel explained the importance of these future films to Capra:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;You were the answer to the General's prayer.\u00a0... You see, Frank, this idea about films to explain \"Why\" the boys are in uniform is General Marshall's own baby, and he wants the nursery right next to his Chief of Staff's office.\nDuring his first meeting with Marshall, Capra received his mission:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Now, Capra, I want to nail down with you a plan to make a series of documented, factual-information films\u2014the first in our history\u2014that will explain to our boys in the Army \"why\" we are fighting, and the \"principles\" for which we are fighting.\u00a0... You have an opportunity to contribute enormously to your country and the cause of freedom. Are you aware of that, sir?\nCountering enemy propaganda films.\nShortly after his meeting with General Marshall, Capra viewed Leni Riefenstahl's \"terrifying motion picture\", \"Triumph of the Will\". Capra describes the film as \"the ominous prelude of Hitler's holocaust of hate. Satan couldn't have devised a more blood-chilling super-spectacle.\u00a0... Though panoplied with all the pomp and mystical trappings of a Wagnerian opera, its message was as blunt and brutal as a lead pipe: We, the Herrenvolk, are the new invincible gods!\"\nAccording to Capra, \"Triumph of the Will\" \"fired no gun, dropped no bombs. But as a psychological weapon aimed at destroying the will to resist, it was just as lethal.\" Capra still had no assistants or facilities, and he began to see his assignment as overwhelming:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I sat alone and pondered. How could I mount a counterattack against \"Triumph of the Will\"; keep alive \"our\" will to resist the master race? I was alone; no studio, no equipment, no personnel.\nCreating a powerful film idea.\nCapra made his primary focus the creation of \"one basic, powerful idea\" that would spread and evolve into other related ideas. He considered one important idea that had always been in his thoughts:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAs a result, his goal became to \"let the \"enemy\" prove to our soldiers the enormity of his cause\u2014and the justness of ours.\" He would compile enemy speeches, films, newsreels, newspaper articles, with a list of the enemy's hostile actions. He presented his ideas to other officers who were now assigned to help him:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I told them of my hunch: Use the enemy's own films to expose their enslaving ends. Let our boys hear the Nazis and the Japs shout their own claims of master-race crud\u2014and our fighting men will \"know\" why they are in uniform.\nWeeks later, after major efforts and disappointments, Capra located hard-to-reach archives within government facilities, and by avoiding normal channels, he was able to gain access:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nProduction.\nProduced from 1942 to 1945, the seven installments range from 40 to 76 minutes in length, and all are available for free on DVD or online since they have always been public domain material by the US government. All are directed by Frank Capra and narrated by Walter Huston alongside radio actors Elliott Lewis, Harry von Zell, film actor Lloyd Nolan and others. The score is performed by the Army Air Force Orchestra.\nThe films employed a great deal of stock footage, including enemy propaganda (such as the Nazis' \"Triumph of the Will\") recontextualized to discredit its creators. Other scenes were performed. Animation was produced by Disney Studios. The quotation ending each film (\"The victory of the democracies can only be complete with the \"utter defeat\" of the war machines of Germany and Japan\") is from the Army Chief of Staff George Marshall.\nAccuracy.\n\"Prelude to War\" and \"The Battle of China\" refer to the \"Tanaka Memorial\" several times by portraying it as \"Japan's \"Mein Kampf\"\" in order to raise US morale for a protracted war against Japan. The authenticity of that document is not accepted by scholars today, and it is regarded as an anti-Japanese hoax, but the \"Tanaka Memorial\" was widely accepted as authentic in the 1930s and the 1940s because Japanese actions corresponded so closely to its plans.\nTo justify the Western Allies' help to the Soviet Union, the series omitted many facts which could have cast the Soviets in a negative light, such as the Soviet occupation of the Baltic States and the Winter War. However, it shows the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact being signed and the Soviet invasion of Poland.\nImpact.\nAfter World War I, methods used to gain support from troops and civilians needed to change. Giving speeches to soldier recruits and to the US public was no longer effective. Film became the medium of choice to persuade US soldiers and recruits on why fighting was necessary. As Kathleen German stated, \"this was the first massive attempt to influence opinion in the U.S. military\" through film. Film was also chosen because it combined the senses of sight and hearing, which gives it an advantage over radio or print. Capra, who had no experience in documentary films, was chosen because \"of his commitment to American ideals\" and because of the popularity of some of his earlier feature films. He was thought \"to understand the heart and soul of American audiences\". Once the documentary series was completed, it was said to contain the \"Capra touch\".\nThe series's appeal was furthered by its editing. \"Throughout his career, Capra depended upon his skill as an editor to achieve the contrast of the individual and the group, critical in the success of his Hollywood movies.\" Capra thought that it would be most effective to use the enemy's original film and propaganda in the series to expose the enemies with their own images. By taking pieces of the enemy material to edit together and placing his own narration over the results, Capra gave meaning and purpose to the war with added narrative. That \"parallel editing\" created an \"us vs. them\" image by re-framing and showing clips out of their original order and context.\nBy such careful editing, the films compare and contrast the forces of evil with the U.S. and its traditional values. Capra highlighted the differences between the US and the enemy and showed how the enemy would attack these values if \"we\" did not fight. That worked to create a battle not only between Allies and the Axis powers but also between good and evil. Capra treated it as a matter of showing the enormity of the Axis and the justness of the Allies.\nThe \"Why We Fight\" series became a heavily used means of presenting information about Axis powers for the American government during WWII. General Surles, director of the Department of War's Bureau of Public Relations, had hoped that the series would be effective enough to allow similar kinds of army films to be shown to the general public. Surles saw that goal to be realized when US President Franklin Roosevelt watched \"Prelude to War\", the most successful of the seven. Roosevelt considered it so important that he ordered its distribution in civilian arenas for public viewing. However, some objections were raised against the series due to its persuasiveness. Lowell Mellett, coordinator of government films and aide to Roosevelt, saw the films as dangerous. He was most concerned with the effect that the series would have after the war was over and the \"hysteria\" that it would create in its wake. At least 54 million Americans had seen the series by the end of the war, and studies were done to gauge the impact of the films. However, results were inconclusive, and so the effectiveness of the series is still disputed.\nLegacy.\nCreated by the US Army Pictorial Services, the films are in the public domain, and all of them are available for download on the Internet Archive.\nOther Capra World War II films.\nCapra was involved in a number of other World War II propaganda films that were not part of the \"Why We Fight\" series. He directed or co-directed the following films:\nCapra also produced the 43-minute film \"The Negro Soldier\" (1944), directed by Stuart Heisler, and the 42-minute film \"\" (1944), directed by Robert Stevenson and Anthony Veiller.\nCapra also directed, uncredited, the 13-minute 1945 military training film \"Your Job in Germany\", written by Dr. Seuss.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "33909", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33909", "title": "Wiccan Rede", "text": "Wicca moral statement\nThe Wiccan Rede is a statement that provides the key moral system in the new religious movement of Wicca and certain other related witchcraft-based faiths. A common form of the Rede is \"An ye harm none, do what ye will\" which was taken from a longer poem also titled the Wiccan Rede.\nThe word \"rede\" derives from Middle English, meaning \"advice\" or \"counsel\", and being closely related to the German or Scandinavian . \"An'\" is an archaic Middle English conjunction, meaning \"if.\" \"Ye\" is an archaic or dialectal form of \"you\" (nominative plural).\nHistory.\nIn its best known form as the \"eight words\" couplet, the Rede was first publicly recorded in a 1964 speech by Doreen Valiente. Other variants of the Rede include:\nAnother notable antecedent was put forth by the philosopher John Stuart Mill with his \"harm principle\" in the 19th century. \"Mill argues that the sole purpose of law should be to stop people from harming others and that should people want to participate in victimless crimes, crimes with no complaining witness, such as gambling, drug usage, engaging in prostitution, then they should not be encroached in doing so.\" In addition, the first part of the phrase is strikingly similar to the Latin maxim primum non nocere (first do no harm).\nThe Long Rede.\nA complete twenty-six line poem entitled \"The Wiccan Rede\" was published in the Spring 1974 issue of neopagan magazine \"Earth Religion News\". Each line contained a rhymed couplet laid out as a single line, the last line being the familiar \"short rede\" couplet beginning \"Eight words...\".\nThis poem was shortly followed by another, slightly different, version, entitled the \"Rede of the Wiccae\", which was published in \"Green Egg\" magazine by Lady Gwen Thompson. She ascribed it to her grandmother Adriana Porter, and claimed that the earlier published text was distorted from \"its original form\". The poem has since been very widely circulated and has appeared in other versions and layouts, with additional or variant passages. It is commonly known as the \"Long Rede\".\nAlthough Thompson wrote that this version of the Rede was in its original form, this declaration is disputed for several reasons, but primarily as the language of the poem refers to Wiccan concepts that are not known to have existed in her grandmother's lifetime. It is sometime ascribed to Thompson herself. Mathiesen and Theitic concluded that 18 to 20 of the verses are lore which would be common to the area of rural 17th to 19th century New England and compiled by the hand of someone who would have been born no later that the late 19th century, and that at least six of the verses which are deemed \"The Wiccan Verses\" were compiled and added by a second and later hand. Since Thompson was dispensing these 26 as a whole from around 1969 it is a reasonable assumption that hers was that second hand. Another claim is that it is adapted from a speech given by Doreen Valiente at a dinner sponsored by the Witchcraft Research Association and mentioned in volume one (1964) of the Pentagram, a United Kingdom pagan newsletter then being published. Valiente did publish a poem \"The Witches Creed\" in her 1978 book, \"Witchcraft for Tomorrow\", which contains some similar concepts.\nDating the Rede.\nKing Pausole, a character in Pierre Lou\u00ffs' \"Les aventures du roi Pausole\" (The Adventures of King Pausole, published in 1901), issued a similar pair of edicts: \"I. \u2014 Ne nuis pas \u00e0 ton voisin. II. \u2014 Ceci bien compris, fais ce qu'il te pla\u00eet.\" (\"Do not harm your neighbor; this being well understood, do that which pleases you.\") In Thelema, a similar phrase, \"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law\", appears in Aleister Crowley's works by 1904, in \"The Book of the Law\". Although Gardner noted the similarity of the rede to King Pausole's words, Silver Ravenwolf believes it is more directly referencing Crowley.\nAccording to Don Frew, Valiente composed the couplet, following Gardner's statement that witches \"are inclined to the morality of the legendary Good King Pausol, 'Do what you like so long as you harm none'\"; he claims the common assumption that the Rede that was copied from Crowley is misinformed, and has resulted in the words often being misquoted as \"an it harm none, do what thou wilt\" instead of \"do what you will\".\nThompson's attribution of the Long Rede to her grandmother has been disputed, since Adriana Porter died in 1946, well before Gerald Gardner published \"The Old Laws\", and no evidence for Porter's authorship exists other than Thompson's word. The poem refers to Wiccan concepts that, though ostensibly very old, have not been proven to pre-date the 1940s. Its attribution to Porter may have formed part of Thompson's claim to be a hereditary witch. Its precise origin has yet to be determined.\nAdrian Bott, in an article written in \"White Dragon\" magazine, 2003, argues that the Long Rede's creation can be placed somewhere between 1964 and 1975. Bott bases his argument on the alleged misuse of archaic English in the poem, in particular of \" an' \" as an abbreviation of \"and\", and of \"ye\" instead of \"the\". Bott states that the author of the poem was evidently unaware that this contraction of \"and\" is not an archaic, but a modern convention. According to Bott, in the \"eight words\" couplet originally cited by Valiente, \"an'\" is used correctly, in the Middle English sense of \" 'in the event that', or simply 'if' \" (as in the Shakespearean \"an hadst thou not come to my bed\") and thus has no apostrophe. In the poem, this has been transformed into an abbreviated \"and\" and given an apostrophe, with every \"and\" in the poem's additional lines then being written \" an' \" as if to match. Accordingly, Bott concludes that the poem was an attempt to expand Valiente's couplet into a full Wiccan credo, written by someone who misunderstood the archaic language they attempted to imitate.\nRobert Mathiesen repeats Bott's objection to \"ye\", but argues that most other archaisms are used correctly. However, he states that they all derive from late 19th century revivalist usages. Based on this fact Mathiesen concludes that early twentieth century authorship of at least part of the poem is probable. He argues that its references to English folklore are consistent with Porter's family history. His provisional conclusion is that a folkloric form of the poem may have been written by Porter, but that it was supplemented and altered by Thompson to add specifically Wiccan material. Mathiessen also takes the view that the last line was probably a Thompson addition derived from Valiente. According to this account, the 1974 variant of the text, which was published by one of Thompson's former initiates, may represent one of the earlier drafts. Its publication prompted Thompson to publish what she \u2013 falsely, according to Mathiessen \u2013 claimed was Porter's \"original\" poem.\nInterpretations.\nThe Rede is similar to a consequentialist formulation of the Golden Rule, a belief that is found in nearly every religion. Not all traditional Wiccans follow the Rede; some Gardnerians (a sect under Wicca) espouse the Charge of the Goddess as a guide for morality. Its line \"Keep pure your highest ideal, strive ever towards it; let naught stop you or turn you aside, for mine is the secret door which opens upon the door of youth\" is used as a maxim for ethical dilemmas.\nThere is some debate in the neopagan and Wiccan communities as to the meaning of the Rede. The debate centres on the concept of the Rede being advice, not a commandment. The rejection of specific exhortations and prohibitions of conduct such as those given in the Judeo-Christian Ten Commandments and emphasis on the consequences of one's actions makes the Rede's character somewhat different from major religious texts such as the Bible or the Qur'an. The Rede is only a guideline which the individual must interpret to fit each particular situation and unlike most religions, which actions \"do harm\" (and which do not) are not discussed in the Rede. What exactly does and does not do harm is therefore open to personal interpretation.\nThe concept of ethical reciprocity is not explicitly stated, but most Wiccans interpret the Rede to imply the Golden Rule in the belief that the spirit of the Rede is to actively do good for one's fellow humans as well as for oneself. Different sects of Wiccans read \"none\" differently. \"None\" can apply to only the self, or it may include animals and/or plants, and so forth. In essence, the Rede can be fully understood as meaning that one should always follow their true will instead of trying to obtain simple wants and to ensure that following one's will does not harm anyone or anything. In this light, the Rede can be seen as encouraging a Wiccan to take personal responsibility for their actions.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is important for reasoning and the guidance of decision-making and behavior. Working memory is often used synonymously with short-term memory, but some theorists consider the two forms of memory distinct, assuming that working memory allows for the manipulation of stored information, whereas short-term memory only refers to the short-term storage of information. Working memory is a theoretical concept central to cognitive psychology, neuropsychology, and neuroscience.\nHistory.\nThe term \"working memory\" was coined by Miller, Galanter, and Pribram, and was used in the 1960s in the context of theories that likened the mind to a computer. In 1968, Atkinson and Shiffrin used the term to describe their \"short-term store\". The term short-term store was the name previously used for working memory. Other suggested names were short-term memory, primary memory, immediate memory, operant memory, and provisional memory. Short-term memory is the ability to remember information over a brief period (in the order of seconds). Most theorists today use the concept of working memory to replace or include the older concept of short-term memory, marking a stronger emphasis on the notion of manipulating information rather than mere maintenance.\nThe earliest mention of experiments on the neural basis of working memory can be traced back to more than 100 years ago, when Hitzig and Ferrier described ablation experiments of the prefrontal cortex (PFC); they concluded that the frontal cortex was important for cognitive rather than sensory processes. In 1935 and 1936, Carlyle Jacobsen and colleagues were the first to show the deleterious effect of prefrontal ablation on delayed response.\nTheories.\nNumerous models have been proposed for how working memory functions, both anatomically and cognitively. Of those, the two that have been most influential are summarized below.\nThe multicomponent model.\nIn 1974 Baddeley and Hitch introduced the multicomponent model of working memory. The theory proposed a model containing three components: the central executive, the phonological loop, and the visuospatial sketchpad with the central executive functioning as a control center of sorts, directing info between the phonological and visuospatial components. The central executive is responsible for, among other things, directing attention to relevant information, suppressing irrelevant information and inappropriate actions, and coordinating cognitive processes when more than one task is simultaneously performed. A \"central executive\" is responsible for supervising the integration of information and for coordinating subordinate systems responsible for the short-term maintenance of information. One subordinate system, the phonological loop (PL), stores phonological information (that is, the sound of language) and prevents its decay by continuously refreshing it in a rehearsal loop. It can, for example, maintain a seven-digit telephone number for as long as one repeats the number to oneself repeatedly. The other subordinate system, the visuospatial sketchpad, stores visual and spatial information. It can be used, for example, for constructing and manipulating visual images and for representing mental maps. The sketchpad can be further broken down into a visual subsystem (dealing with such phenomena as shape, colour, and texture), and a spatial subsystem (dealing with location).\nIn 2000 Baddeley extended the model by adding a fourth component, the episodic buffer, which holds representations that integrate phonological, visual, and spatial information, and possibly information not covered by the subordinate systems (e.g.,\u00a0semantic information, musical information). The episodic buffer is also the link between working memory and long-term memory. The component is episodic because it is assumed to bind information into a unitary episodic representation. The episodic buffer resembles Tulving's concept of episodic memory, but it differs in that the episodic buffer is a temporary store.\nWorking memory as part of long-term memory.\nCentral Executive\nLong-term Memory\nThe central executive of working memory is retrieving memory from long-term memory.\nAnders Ericsson and Walter Kintsch have introduced the notion of \"long-term working memory\", which they define as a set of \"retrieval structures\" in long-term memory that enable seamless access to the information relevant for everyday tasks. In this way, parts of long-term memory effectively function as working memory. In a similar vein, Cowan does not regard working memory as a separate system from long-term memory. Representations in working memory are a subset of representations in long-term memory. Working memory is organized into two embedded levels. The first consists of long-term memory representations that are activated. There can be many of these\u2014there is theoretically no limit to the activation of representations in long-term memory. The second level is called the focus of attention. The focus is regarded as having a limited capacity and holds up to four of the activated representations.\nOberauer has extended Cowan's model by adding a third component\u2014a more narrow focus of attention that holds only one chunk at a time. The one-element focus is embedded in the four-element focus and serves to select a single chunk for processing. For example, four digits can be held in mind at the same time in Cowan's \"focus of attention\". When the individual wishes to perform a process on each of these digits\u2014for example, adding the number two to each digit\u2014separate processing is required for each digit since most individuals cannot perform several mathematical processes in parallel. Oberauer's attentional component selects one of the digits for processing and then shifts the attentional focus to the next digit, continuing until all digits have been processed.\nCapacity.\nWorking memory is widely acknowledged as having limited capacity. An early quantification of the capacity limit associated with short-term memory was the \"magical number seven\" suggested by Miller in 1956. Miller claimed that the information-processing capacity of young adults is around seven elements, referred to as \"chunks\", regardless of whether the elements are digits, letters, words, or other units. Later research revealed this number depends on the category of chunks used (e.g., span may be around seven for digits, six for letters, and five for words), and even on features of the chunks within a category. For instance, attention span is lower for longer words than short words. In general, memory span for verbal contents (digits, letters, words, etc.) depends on the phonological complexity of the content (i.e., the number of phonemes, the number of syllables), and on the lexical status of the contents (whether the contents are words known to the person or not). Several other factors affect a person's measured span, and therefore it is difficult to pin down the capacity of short-term or working memory to a number of chunks. Nonetheless, Cowan proposed that working memory has a capacity of about four chunks in young adults (and fewer in children and old adults).\nIn the visual domain, some investigations report no fixed capacity limit with respect to the total number of items that can be held in working memory. Instead, the results argue for a limited resource that can be flexibly shared between items retained in memory (see below in Resource theories), with some items in the focus of attention being allocated more resource and recalled with greater precision.\nWhereas most adults can repeat about seven digits in correct order, some individuals have shown impressive enlargements of their digit span\u2014up to 80 digits. This feat is possible by extensive training on an encoding strategy by which the digits in a list are grouped (usually in groups of three to five) and these groups are encoded as a single unit (a chunk). For this to succeed, participants must be able to recognize the groups as some known string of digits. One person studied by Ericsson and his colleagues, for example, used an extensive knowledge of racing times from the history of sports in the process of coding chunks: several such chunks could then be combined into a higher-order chunk, forming a hierarchy of chunks. In this way, only some chunks at the highest level of the hierarchy must be retained in working memory, and for retrieval the chunks are unpacked. That is, the chunks in working memory act as retrieval cues that point to the digits they contain. Practicing memory skills such as these does not expand working memory capacity proper: it is the capacity to transfer (and retrieve) information from long-term memory that is improved, according to Ericsson and Kintsch (1995; see also Gobet &amp; Simon, 2000).\nMeasures and correlates.\nWorking memory capacity can be tested by a variety of tasks. A commonly used measure is a dual-task paradigm, combining a memory span measure with a concurrent processing task, sometimes referred to as \"complex span\". Daneman and Carpenter invented the first version of this kind of task, the \"reading span\", in 1980. Subjects read a number of sentences (usually between two and six) and tried to remember the last word of each sentence. At the end of the list of sentences, they repeated back the words in their correct order. Other tasks that do not have this dual-task nature have also been shown to be good measures of working memory capacity. Whereas Daneman and Carpenter believed that the combination of \"storage\" (maintenance) and processing is needed to measure working memory capacity, we know now that the capacity of working memory can be measured with short-term memory tasks that have no additional processing component. Conversely, working memory capacity can also be measured with certain processing tasks that do not involve maintenance of information. The question of what features a task must have to qualify as a good measure of working memory capacity is a topic of ongoing research.\nRecently, several studies of visual working memory have used delayed response tasks. These use analogue responses in a continuous space, rather than a binary (correct/incorrect) recall method, as often used in visual change detection tasks. Instead of asking participants to report whether a change occurred between the memory and probe array, delayed reproduction tasks require them to reproduce the precise quality of a visual feature, e.g. an object's location, orientation or colour. In addition, the combination of visual perception such as within objects and colors can be used to improve memory strategy through elaboration, thus creating reinforcement within the capacity of working memory.\nMeasures of working-memory capacity are strongly related to performance in other complex cognitive tasks, such as reading comprehension, problem solving, and with measures of intelligence quotient.\nSome researchers have argued that working-memory capacity reflects the efficiency of executive functions, most notably the ability to maintain multiple task-relevant representations in the face of distracting irrelevant information; and that such tasks seem to reflect individual differences in the ability to focus and maintain attention, particularly when other events are serving to capture attention. Both working memory and executive functions rely strongly, though not exclusively, on frontal brain areas.\nOther researchers have argued that the capacity of working memory is better characterized as the ability to mentally form relations between elements, or to grasp relations in given information. This idea has been advanced, among others, by Graeme Halford, who illustrated it by our limited ability to understand statistical interactions between variables. These authors asked people to compare written statements about the relations between several variables to graphs illustrating the same or a different relation, as in the following sentence: \"If the cake is from France, then it has more sugar if it is made with chocolate than if it is made with cream, but if the cake is from Italy, then it has more sugar if it is made with cream than if it is made of chocolate\". This statement describes a relation between three variables (country, ingredient, and amount of sugar), which is the maximum most individuals can understand. The capacity limit apparent here is obviously not a memory limit (all relevant information can be seen continuously) but a limit to how many relationships are discerned simultaneously.\nExperimental studies of working-memory capacity.\nThere are several hypotheses about the nature of the capacity limit. One is that a limited pool of cognitive resources is needed to keep representations active and thereby available for processing, and for carrying out processes. Another hypothesis is that memory traces in working memory decay within a few seconds, unless refreshed through rehearsal, and because the speed of rehearsal is limited, we can maintain only a limited amount of information. Yet another idea is that representations held in working memory interfere with each other.\nDecay theories.\nThe assumption that the contents of short-term or working memory decay over time, unless decay is prevented by rehearsal, goes back to the early days of experimental research on short-term memory. It is also an important assumption in the multi-component theory of working memory. The most elaborate decay-based theory of working memory to date is the \"time-based resource sharing model\". This theory assumes that representations in working memory decay unless they are refreshed. Refreshing them requires an attentional mechanism that is also needed for any concurrent processing task. When there are small time intervals in which the processing task does not require attention, this time can be used to refresh memory traces. The theory therefore predicts that the amount of forgetting depends on the temporal density (rate and duration) of attentional demands of the processing task\u2014this density is called \"cognitive load\". The cognitive load depends on two variables, the rate at which the processing task requires individual steps to be carried out, and the duration of each step. For example, if the processing task consists of adding digits, then having to add another digit every half-second places a higher cognitive load on the system than having to add another digit every two seconds. In a series of experiments, Barrouillet and colleagues have shown that memory for lists of letters depends neither on the number of processing steps nor the total time of processing but on cognitive load.\nResource theories.\nResource theories assume that the capacity of working memory is a limited resource that must be shared between all representations that need to be maintained in working memory simultaneously. Some resource theorists also assume that maintenance and concurrent processing share the same resource; this can explain why maintenance is typically impaired by a concurrent processing demand. Resource theories have been very successful in explaining data from tests of working memory for simple visual features, such as colors or orientations of bars. An ongoing debate is whether the resource is a continuous quantity that can be subdivided among any number of items in working memory, or whether it consists of a small number of discrete \"slots\", each of which can be assigned to one memory item, so that only a limited number of about 3 items can be maintained in working memory at all.\nInterference theories.\nSeveral forms of interference have been discussed by theorists. One of the oldest ideas is that new items simply replace older ones in working memory. Another form of interference is retrieval competition. For example, when the task is to remember a list of 7 words in their order, we need to start recall with the first word. While trying to retrieve the first word, the second word, which is represented in proximity, is accidentally retrieved as well, and the two compete for being recalled. Errors in serial recall tasks are often confusions of neighboring items on a memory list (so-called transpositions), showing that retrieval competition plays a role in limiting our ability to recall lists in order, and probably also in other working memory tasks. A third form of interference is the distortion of representations by superposition: When multiple representations are added on top of each other, each of them is blurred by the presence of all the others. A fourth form of interference assumed by some authors is feature overwriting. The idea is that each word, digit, or other item in working memory is represented as a bundle of features, and when two items share some features, one of them steals the features from the other. As more items are held in working memory, whose features begin to overlap, the more each of them will be degraded by the loss of some features.\nLimitations.\nNone of these hypotheses can explain the experimental data entirely. The resource hypothesis, for example, was meant to explain the trade-off between maintenance and processing: The more information must be maintained in working memory, the slower and more error prone concurrent processes become, and with a higher demand on concurrent processing memory suffers. This trade-off has been investigated by tasks like the reading-span task described above. It has been found that the amount of trade-off depends on the similarity of the information to be remembered and the information to be processed. For example, remembering numbers while processing spatial information, or remembering spatial information while processing numbers, impair each other much less than when material of the same kind must be remembered and processed. Also, remembering words and processing digits, or remembering digits and processing words, is easier than remembering and processing materials of the same category. These findings are also difficult to explain for the decay hypothesis, because decay of memory representations should depend only on how long the processing task delays rehearsal or recall, not on the content of the processing task. A further problem for the decay hypothesis comes from experiments in which the recall of a list of letters was delayed, either by instructing participants to recall at a slower pace, or by instructing them to say an irrelevant word once or three times in between recall of each letter. Delaying recall had virtually no effect on recall accuracy. The interference theory seems to fare best with explaining why the similarity between memory contents and the contents of concurrent processing tasks affects how much they impair each other. More similar materials are more likely to be confused, leading to retrieval competition.\nDevelopment.\nThe capacity of working memory increases gradually over childhood and declines gradually in old age.\nChildhood.\nMeasures of performance on tests of working memory increase continuously between early childhood and adolescence, while the structure of correlations between different tests remains largely constant. Starting with work in the Neo-Piagetian tradition, theorists have argued that the growth of working-memory capacity is a major driving force of cognitive development. This hypothesis has received substantial empirical support from studies showing that the capacity of working memory is a strong predictor of cognitive abilities in childhood. Particularly strong evidence for a role of working memory for development comes from a longitudinal study showing that working-memory capacity at one age predicts reasoning ability at a later age. Studies in the Neo-Piagetian tradition have added to this picture by analyzing the complexity of cognitive tasks in terms of the number of items or relations that have to be considered simultaneously for a solution. Across a broad range of tasks, children manage task versions of the same level of complexity at about the same age, consistent with the view that working memory capacity limits the complexity they can handle at a given age. One experiment has correlated that a decrease of complexity regarding capacity limits are articulated from research concerning language processes, outlining the effect on the capacity of children with language disorders, having performed lower than their age-matched peers. A correlation between memory storage deficits can be viewed as a contribution due to these language disorders, or rather the cause of the language disorder, but has not fully suggested a deficit in being able to rehearse information.\nAlthough neuroscience studies support the notion that children rely on prefrontal cortex for performing various working memory tasks, an fMRI meta-analysis on children compared to adults performing the n back task revealed a lack of consistent prefrontal cortex activation in children, while posterior regions including the insular cortex and cerebellum remain intact.\nAging.\nWorking memory is among the cognitive functions most sensitive to decline in old age. Several explanations for this decline have been offered. One is the processing speed theory of cognitive aging by Tim Salthouse. Drawing on the finding that cognitive processes generally slow as people grow older, Salthouse argues that slower processing leaves more time for working memory content to decay, thus reducing effective capacity. However, the decline of working memory capacity cannot be entirely attributed to slowing because capacity declines more in old age than speed. Another proposal is the inhibition hypothesis advanced by Lynn Hasher and Rose Zacks. This theory assumes a general deficit in old age in the ability to inhibit irrelevant information. Thus, working memory should tend to be cluttered with irrelevant content that reduces effective capacity for relevant content. The assumption of an inhibition deficit in old age has received much empirical support but, so far, it is not clear whether the decline in inhibitory ability fully explains the decline of working memory capacity. An explanation on the neural level of the decline of working memory and other cognitive functions in old age has been proposed by West. She argues that working memory depends to a large degree on the prefrontal cortex, which deteriorates more than other brain regions as we grow old. The prefrontal cortex hemodynamics also play an important role in the impairment of working memory through a prevalence of sleeping disorders that many older adults face but it is not the only region that is influenced since other brain regions have demonstrated an output of influence within neuroimaging studies. Within the studies of fMRI, a connection between sleep deprivation was observed through a reduction of performance on the prefrontal cortex and a overall decrease in working memory performance. Age-related decline in working memory can be briefly reversed using low intensity transcranial stimulation to synchronize rhythms in prefrontal and temporal areas.\nThe neurobiological bases for reduced working memory abilities has been studied in aging macaques, who naturally develop impairments in working memory and the executive functions. Research has shown that aged macaques have reduced working memory-related neuronal firing in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, that arises in part from excessive cAMP-PKA-calcium signaling, which opens nearby potassium channels that weaken the glutamate synapses on spines needed to maintain persistent firing across the delay period when there is no sensory stimulation. Dysregulation of this process with age likely involves increased inflammation with age. Sustained weakness leads to loss of dendritic spines, the site of essential glutamate connections.\nTraining.\nSome studies in the effects of training on working memory, including the first by Torkel Klingberg, suggest that working memory in those with ADHD can improve by training. This study found that a period of working memory training increases a range of cognitive abilities and increases IQ test scores. Another study by the same group has shown that, after training, measured brain activity related to working memory increased in the prefrontal cortex, an area that many researchers have associated with working memory functions. One study has shown that working memory training increases the density of prefrontal and parietal dopamine receptors (specifically, DRD1) in test subjects. However, subsequent experiments with the same training program have shown mixed results, with some successfully replicating, and others failing to replicate the beneficial effects of training on cognitive performance.\nIn another influential study, training with a working memory task (the dual n-back task) improved performance on a fluid intelligence test in healthy young adults. The improvement of fluid intelligence by training with the n-back task was replicated in 2010, but two studies published in 2012 failed to reproduce the effect. The combined evidence from about 30 experimental studies on the effectiveness of working-memory training has been evaluated by several meta-analyses. The authors of these meta-analyses disagree in their conclusions as to whether or not working-memory training improves intelligence. Yet these meta-analyses agree that, the more distant the outcome measure, the weaker is the causal link \u2013 training working memory almost always yields increases in working memory, often in attention, and sometimes in academic performance, but it is still an outstanding question what exact circumstances differs between cases of successful and unsuccessful transfer of effects.\nIn the brain.\nNeural mechanisms of maintaining information.\nThe first insights into the neuronal and neurotransmitter basis of working memory came from animal research. The work of Jacobsen and Fulton in the 1930s first showed that lesions to the PFC impaired spatial working memory performance in monkeys. The later work of Joaquin Fuster recorded the electrical activity of neurons in the PFC of monkeys while they were doing a delayed matching task. In that task, the monkey sees how the experimenter places a bit of food under one of two identical-looking cups. A shutter is then lowered for a variable delay period, screening off the cups from the monkey's view. After the delay, the shutter opens and the monkey is allowed to retrieve the food from under the cups. Successful retrieval in the first attempt \u2013 something the animal can achieve after some training on the task \u2013 requires holding the location of the food in memory over the delay period. Fuster found neurons in the PFC that fired mostly during the delay period, suggesting that they were involved in representing the food location while it was invisible. Later research has shown similar delay-active neurons also in the posterior parietal cortex, the thalamus, the caudate, and the globus pallidus. The work of Goldman-Rakic and others showed that principal sulcal, dorsolateral PFC interconnects with all of these brain regions, and that neuronal microcircuits within PFC are able to maintain information in working memory through recurrent excitatory glutamate networks of pyramidal cells that continue to fire throughout the delay period. These circuits are tuned by lateral inhibition from GABAergic interneurons. The neuromodulatory arousal systems markedly alter PFC working memory function; for example, either too little or too much dopamine or norepinephrine impairs PFC network firing and working memory performance. A brain network analysis demonstrates that the FPC network requires less induced energy during working memory tasks than other functional brain networks. This finding underscores the efficient processing of the FPC network and highlights its crucial role in supporting working memory processes.&lt;ref name=\"10.1038/s41598-024-83696-7\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nThe research described above on persistent firing of certain neurons in the delay period of working memory tasks shows that the brain has a mechanism of keeping representations active without external input. Keeping representations active, however, is not enough if the task demands maintaining more than one chunk of information. In addition, the components and features of each chunk must be bound together to prevent them from being mixed up. For example, if a red triangle and a green square must be remembered at the same time, one must make sure that \"red\" is bound to \"triangle\" and \"green\" is bound to \"square\". One way of establishing such bindings is by having the neurons that represent features of the same chunk fire in synchrony, and those that represent features belonging to different chunks fire out of sync. In the example, neurons representing redness would fire in synchrony with neurons representing the triangular shape, but out of sync with those representing the square shape. So far, there is no direct evidence that working memory uses this binding mechanism, and other mechanisms have been proposed as well. It has been speculated that synchronous firing of neurons involved in working memory oscillate with frequencies in the theta band (4 to 8\u00a0Hz). Indeed, the power of theta frequency in the EEG increases with working memory load, and oscillations in the theta band measured over different parts of the skull become more coordinated when the person tries to remember the binding between two components of information.\nLocalization in the brain.\nLocalization of brain functions in humans has become much easier with the advent of brain imaging methods (PET and fMRI). This research has confirmed that areas in the PFC are involved in working memory functions. During the 1990s much debate had centered on the different functions of the ventrolateral (i.e.,\u00a0lower areas) and the dorsolateral (higher) areas of the PFC. A human lesion study provides additional evidence for the role of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in working memory. One view was that the dorsolateral areas are responsible for spatial working memory and the ventrolateral areas for non-spatial working memory. Another view proposed a functional distinction, arguing that ventrolateral areas are mostly involved in pure maintenance of information, whereas dorsolateral areas are more involved in tasks requiring some processing of the memorized material. The debate is not entirely resolved but most of the evidence supports the functional distinction.\nBrain imaging has revealed that working memory functions are not limited to the PFC. A review of numerous studies shows areas of activation during working memory tasks scattered over a large part of the cortex. There is a tendency for spatial tasks to recruit more right-hemisphere areas, and for verbal and object working memory to recruit more left-hemisphere areas. The activation during verbal working memory tasks can be broken down into one component reflecting maintenance, in the left posterior parietal cortex, and a component reflecting subvocal rehearsal, in the left frontal cortex (Broca's area, known to be involved in speech production). Studies using biologically constrained neural network models indicate that human-specific cortical connectivity supports robust verbal working memory, distinguishing humans from non-human primates.\nThere is an emerging consensus that most working memory tasks recruit a network of PFC and parietal areas. A study has shown that during a working memory task the connectivity between these areas increases. Another study has demonstrated that these areas are necessary for working memory, and not simply activated accidentally during working memory tasks, by temporarily blocking them through transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), thereby producing an impairment in task performance.\nA current debate concerns the function of these brain areas. The PFC has been found to be active in a variety of tasks that require executive functions. This has led some researchers to argue that the role of PFC in working memory is in controlling attention, selecting strategies, and manipulating information in working memory, but not in maintenance of information. The maintenance function is attributed to more posterior areas of the brain, including the parietal cortex. Other authors interpret the activity in parietal cortex as reflecting executive functions, because the same area is also activated in other tasks requiring attention but not memory. Evidence from decoding studying employing multi-voxel-pattern-analysis of fMRI data showed the content of visual working memory can be decoded from activity patterns in visual cortex, but not prefrontal cortex. This led to the suggestion that the maintenance function of visual working memory is performed by visual cortex while the role of the prefrontal cortex is in executive control over working memory though it has been pointed out that such comparisons do not take into account the base rate of decoding across different regions.\nA 2003 meta-analysis of 60 neuroimaging studies found left frontal cortex was involved in low-task demand verbal working memory and right frontal cortex for spatial working memory. Brodmann's areas (BAs) 6, 8, and 9, in the superior frontal cortex was involved when working memory must be continuously updated and when memory for temporal order had to be maintained. Right Brodmann 10 and 47 in the ventral frontal cortex were involved more frequently with demand for manipulation such as dual-task requirements or mental operations, and Brodmann 7 in the posterior parietal cortex was also involved in all types of executive function. Updating information in visual working memory is also influenced by the functional neural network connecting different brain regions. The dorsolateral PFC plays a crucial role in this process. In particular, the middle frontal gyrus may be involved in the maintenance, and the frontal operculum in the controlled processing of materials in working memory. Studies have also shown the role of attentional switching in working memory updating, mediated by the superior parietal lobule. Working memory updating also involves a repetition mechanism mediated by the temporal cortex. And in addition, the process of working memory updating involves the sensory cortex to encode and store certain visual stimuli, such as geometric shapes (inferior occipital gyrus) and faces (fusiform gyrus).\nWorking memory has been suggested to involve two processes with different neuroanatomical locations in the frontal and parietal lobes. First, a selection operation that retrieves the most relevant item, and second an updating operation that changes the focus of attention made upon it. Updating the attentional focus has been found to involve the transient activation in the caudal superior frontal sulcus and posterior parietal cortex, while increasing demands on selection selectively changes activation in the rostral superior frontal sulcus and posterior cingulate/precuneus.\nArticulating the differential function of brain regions involved in working memory is dependent on tasks able to distinguish these functions. Most brain imaging studies of working memory have used recognition tasks such as delayed recognition of one or several stimuli, or the n-back task, in which each new stimulus in a long series must be compared to the one presented n steps back in the series. The advantage of recognition tasks is that they require minimal movement (just pressing one of two keys), making fixation of the head in the scanner easier. Experimental research and research on individual differences in working memory, however, has used largely recall tasks (e.g.,\u00a0the reading span task, see below). It is not clear to what degree recognition and recall tasks reflect the same processes and the same capacity limitations.\nBrain imaging studies have been conducted with the reading span task or related tasks. Increased activation during these tasks was found in the PFC and, in several studies, also in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). People performing better on the task showed larger increase of activation in these areas, and their activation was correlated more over time, suggesting that their neural activity in these two areas was better coordinated, possibly due to stronger connectivity.\nNeural models.\nOne approach to modeling the neurophysiology and the functioning of working memory is prefrontal cortex basal ganglia working memory (PBWM). In this model, the prefrontal cortex works hand-in-hand with the basal ganglia to accomplish the tasks of working memory. Many studies have shown this to be the case. One used ablation techniques in patients who had had seizures and had damage to the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia. Researchers found that such damage resulted in decreased capacity to carry out the executive function of working memory. Additional research conducted on patients with brain alterations due to methamphetamine use found that training working memory increases volume in the basal ganglia.\nEffects of stress on neurophysiology.\nWorking memory is impaired by acute and chronic psychological stress. This phenomenon was first discovered in animal studies by Arnsten and colleagues, who have shown that stress-induced catecholamine release in PFC rapidly decreases PFC neuronal firing and impairs working memory performance through feedforward, intracellular signaling pathways that open potassium channels to rapidly weaken prefrontal network connections. This process of rapid changes in network strength is called Dynamic Network Connectivity, and can be seen in human brain imaging when cortical functional connectivity rapidly changes in response to a stressor. Exposure to chronic stress leads to more profound working memory deficits and additional architectural changes in PFC, including dendritic atrophy and spine loss, which can be prevented by inhibition of protein kinase C signaling. fMRI research has extended this research to humans, and confirms that reduced working memory caused by acute stress links to reduced activation of the PFC, and stress increased levels of catecholamines. Imaging studies of medical students undergoing stressful exams have also shown weakened PFC functional connectivity, consistent with the animal studies. The marked effects of stress on PFC structure and function may help to explain how stress can cause or exacerbate mental illness.\nThe more stress in one's life, the lower the efficiency of working memory in performing simple cognitive tasks. Students who performed exercises that reduced the intrusion of negative thoughts showed an increase in their working memory capacity. Mood states (positive or negative) can have an influence on the neurotransmitter dopamine, which in turn can affect problem solving.\nEffects of alcohol on neurophysiology.\nExcessive alcohol use can result in brain damage which impairs working memory. Alcohol has an effect on the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) response. The BOLD response correlates increased blood oxygenation with brain activity, which makes this response a useful tool for measuring neuronal activity. The BOLD response affects regions of the brain such as the basal ganglia and thalamus when performing a working memory task. Adolescents who start drinking at a young age show a decreased BOLD response in these brain regions. Alcohol dependent young women in particular exhibit less of a BOLD response in parietal and frontal cortices when performing a spatial working memory task. Binge drinking, specifically, can also affect one's performance on working memory tasks, particularly visual working memory. Additionally, there seems to be a gender difference in regards to how alcohol affects working memory. While women perform better on verbal working memory tasks after consuming alcohol compared to men, they appear to perform worse on spatial working memory tasks as indicated by less brain activity. Finally, age seems to be an additional factor. Older adults are more susceptible than others to the effects of alcohol on working memory.\nGenetics.\nBehavioral genetics.\nIndividual differences in working-memory capacity are to some extent heritable; that is, about half of the variation between individuals is related to differences in their genes. The genetic component of variability of working-memory capacity is largely shared with that of fluid intelligence.\nAttempts to identify individual genes.\nLittle is known about which genes are related to the functioning of working memory. Within the theoretical framework of the multi-component model, one candidate gene has been proposed, namely ROBO1 for the hypothetical phonological loop component of working memory.\nMore recently another gene was found regarding working memory. Looking at genetically diverse mice, GPR12 was found in promoting a protein necessary for working memory. When they took mice that were performing worse on memory tests than their control mouse counterparts and increased their GPR12 proteins, those mice improved from 50% to 80%. That brought the low performance mice up to level similar to their control counterparts.\nWith the build up of prior work on mice such as testing the Formimidoyltransferase Cyclodeaminase (FTCD) gene in regards to the Morris water maze performance, testing out if there was a potential variation of genetic coding within the FTCD gene within humans was soon tested out. Results showed that a variation was found but varied depending on the age of the individual. In regards to the FTCD gene, it appeared that only children were affected by it. Working memory seemed to have a higher performance when the FTCD gene was present but had no similar affect to adults.\nRole in academic achievement.\nWorking memory capacity is correlated with learning outcomes in literacy and numeracy. Initial evidence for this relation comes from the correlation between working-memory capacity and reading comprehension, as first observed by Daneman and Carpenter (1980) and confirmed in a later meta-analytic review of several studies. Subsequent work found that working memory performance in primary school children accurately predicted performance in mathematical problem solving. One longitudinal study showed that a child's working memory at 5 years old is a better predictor of academic success than IQ.\nA randomized controlled study of 580 children in Germany indicated that working memory training at age six had a significant positive effect in spatial working memory immediately after training, and that the effect gradually transferred to other areas, with significant and meaningful increases in reading comprehension, mathematics (geometry), and IQ (measured by Raven matrices). Additionally, a marked increase in ability to inhibit impulses was detected in the follow-up after one year, measured as a higher score in the Go-No Go task. Four years after the treatment, the effects persisted and was captured as a 16 percentage point higher acceptance rate to the academic track (German Gymnasium), as compared to the control group.\nIn a large-scale screening study, one in ten children in mainstream classrooms were identified with working memory deficits. The majority of them performed very poorly in academic achievements, independent of their IQ. Similarly, working memory deficits have been identified in national curriculum low-achievers as young as seven years of age. Without appropriate intervention, these children lag behind their peers. A recent study of 37 school-age children with significant learning disabilities has shown that working memory capacity at baseline measurement, but not IQ, predicts learning outcomes two years later. This suggests that working memory impairments are associated with low learning outcomes and constitute a high risk factor for educational underachievement for children. In children with learning disabilities such as dyslexia, ADHD, and developmental coordination disorder, a similar pattern is evident.\nRelation to attention.\nThere is some evidence that optimal working memory performance links to the neural ability to focus attention on task-relevant information and to ignore distractions, and that practice-related improvement in working memory is due to increasing these abilities. One line of research suggests a link between the working memory capacities of a person and their ability to control the orientation of attention to stimuli in the environment. Such control enables people to attend to information important for their current goals, and to ignore goal-irrelevant stimuli that tend to capture their attention due to their sensory saliency (such as an ambulance siren). The direction of attention according to one's goals is assumed to rely on \"top-down\" signals from the pre-frontal cortex (PFC) that biases processing in posterior cortical areas. Capture of attention by salient stimuli is assumed to be driven by \"bottom-up\" signals from subcortical structures and the primary sensory cortices. The ability to override \"bottom-up\" capture of attention differs between individuals, and this difference has been found to correlate with their performance in a working-memory test for visual information. Another study, however, found no correlation between the ability to override attentional capture and measures of more general working-memory capacity.\nRelationship with neural disorders.\nAn impairment of working memory functioning is normally seen in several neural disorders:\nADHD.\nSeveral authors have proposed that symptoms of ADHD arise from a primary deficit in a specific executive function (EF) domain such as working memory, response inhibition or a more general weakness in executive control. A meta-analytical review cites several studies that found significant lower group results for ADHD in spatial and verbal working memory tasks, and in several other EF tasks. However, the authors concluded that EF weaknesses neither are necessary nor sufficient to cause all cases of ADHD.\nSeveral neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and glutamate may be involved in both ADHD and working memory. Both are associated with the frontal brain, self-direction and self-regulation, but cause\u2013effect have not been confirmed, so it is unclear whether working memory dysfunction leads to ADHD, or ADHD distractibility leads to poor functionality of working memory, or if there is some other connection.\nParkinson's disease.\nPatients with Parkinson's show signs of a reduced verbal function of working memory. They wanted to find if the reduction is due to a lack of ability to focus on relevant tasks, or a low amount of memory capacity. Twenty-one patients with Parkinson's were tested in comparison to the control group of 28 participants of the same age. The researchers found that both hypotheses were the reason working memory function is reduced which did not fully agree with their hypothesis that it is either one or the other.\nAlzheimer's disease.\nAs Alzheimer's disease becomes more serious, less working memory functions. In addition to deficits in episodic memory, Alzheimer's disease is associated with impairments in visual short-term memory, assessed using delayed reproduction tasks. These investigations point to a deficit in visual feature binding as an important component of the deficit in Alzheimer's disease. There is one study that focuses on the neural connections and fluidity of working memory in mice brains. Half of the mice were given an injection that mimicked the effects of Alzheimer's, and the other half were not. Then the mice were expected to go through a maze that is a task to test working memory. The study helps answer questions about how Alzheimer's can deteriorate the working memory and ultimately obliterate memory functions.\nHuntington's disease.\nA group of researchers hosted a study that researched the function and connectivity of working memory over a 30-month longitudinal experiment. It found that there were certain places in the brain where most connectivity was decreased in pre-Huntington diseased patients, in comparison to the control group that remained consistently functional.\nRelationship with uncertainty.\nA recent study by Li and colleagues showed evidence that the same brain regions responsible for working memory are also responsible for how much humans trust those memories. In the past, studies have shown that individuals can evaluate how much they trust their own memories, but how humans can do this was largely unknown. Using spatial memory tests and fMRI scans, they processed where and when the information was being stored and used this data to determine memory errors. They also asked the participants to express how uncertain they were about their memories. With both sets of information, the researchers could conclude that memory and the trust in that memory are stored within the same brain region.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

There he appeared as Frederick in an 1809 production of \"Lovers' Vows\". At the Covent Garden Theatre in 1813, in light comedy and melodrama, he made his first definite success. He was Pylades to William Charles Macready's Orestes in Ambrose Philips's \"Distressed Mother\" when Macready made his first appearance there, in 1816. He created the parts of Appius Claudius in Sheridan Knowles's \"Virginius\" (1820) and of Modus in his \"The Hunchback\" (1832).\nIn 1827 Abbot organized the company, including Harriet Smithson, which acted Shakespeare in Paris. His position was as stage manager; he performed at the Salle Favart, but not to plaudits. On his return to London he played Romeo to Fanny Kemble's \"Juliet\" (1830). Two of Abbot's melodramas, \"The Youthful Days of Frederick the Great\" (1817) and \"Swedish Patriotism\" (1819), were produced at Covent Garden.\nAbbot also worked in America, where he first appeared as \"Mr. Beverly\" in an 1832 production of \"The Gamester\" at the Park Theatre in New York. Later he moved to Charleston, South Carolina, where he created the New Charleston Theatre and operated it from 1837 through 1841. This theatre brought stars like Ellen Tree to the company there, but did not enjoy major success.\nWilliam Abbot probably died in New York on 7 June 1843, although some sources say that he died in Baltimore, Maryland.

His almost 49-year-long reign was the longest for a Scottish monarch before the Union of the Crowns in 1603.\nEarly life.\nWilliam was born around 1142, during the reign of his grandfather King David I of Scotland. His parents were Henry of Scotland, a younger son of David I, and Ada de Warenne, a daughter of the powerful Anglo-Norman lord William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey and Elizabeth of Vermandois, Countess of Leicester, herself a granddaughter of Henry I of France. William was around 10 years old when his father died in 1152, making his elder brother Malcolm the heir apparent to their grandfather. From his father, William inherited the Earldom of Northumbria. David I died the next year, and William became heir presumptive to the new king, Malcolm IV. In 1157, William lost the Earldom of Northumbria to Henry II of England.\nReign.\nMalcolm IV did not live for long, and upon his death on 9 December 1165 at age 24, William ascended the throne. The new monarch was inaugurated on 24 December 1165. His brother's steward, constable, and chancellor remained in office, and William confirmed Malcolm IV's last bequest to Dunfermline Abbey. In contrast to his deeply religious, frail brother, William was powerfully built, redheaded, and headstrong. He was an effective monarch whose reign was marred by his ill-fated attempts to regain control of his paternal inheritance of Northumbria from the Anglo-Normans.\nAfter his accession to the throne William spent some time at the court of King Henry II; then, quarrelling with Henry, he arranged in 1168 the first definite treaty of alliance between France and Scotland.\nWilliam was then a key player in the Revolt of 1173\u20131174 against Henry II, which was led by Henry's sons with some short-lived assistance from Louis VII of France. In 1174, at the Battle of Alnwick, during a raid in support of the revolt, William was surprised in this encampment with only 60 men to the English 400. He recklessly charged the English troops himself, shouting, \"Now we shall see which of us are good knights!\" He was unhorsed and captured by Henry's troops led by Ranulf de Glanvill and taken in chains to Newcastle, then Northampton, and then transferred to Caen then Falaise in Normandy. Henry then sent an army to Scotland and occupied it. As ransom and to regain his kingdom, William had to acknowledge Henry as his feudal superior and agree to pay for the cost of the English army's occupation of Scotland by taxing the Scots. The cost was equal to 40,000 Scottish marks (\u00a326,000). The church in Scotland was also subjected to that of England. William acknowledged this by signing the Treaty of Falaise and was then allowed to return to Scotland. On 10 August 1175 he swore fealty to Henry II at York Castle and became his liege man.\nThe humiliation of the Treaty of Falaise triggered a revolt in Galloway which lasted until 1186 and prompted the construction of a castle at Dumfries. In 1179, meanwhile, William and his brother David personally led a force northwards into Easter Ross, establishing two further castles, north of the Beauly and Cromarty Firths: one on the Black Isle at Ederdour; and the other at Dunkeath, near the mouth of the Cromarty Firth opposite Cromarty. The aim was to discourage the Norse earls of Orkney from expanding beyond Caithness.\nA further rising in 1181 involved Donald Meic Uilleim, descendant of King Duncan II. Donald briefly took over Ross; not until he died in 1187 was William able to reclaim Donald's stronghold of Inverness. Further royal expeditions were required in 1197 and 1202 to fully neutralise the Orcadian threat.\nWilliam also quarrelled with Pope Alexander III, a quarrel which arose out of a double choice for the vacant bishopric of St Andrews. The king put forward his chaplain, Hugh, while the pope supported the archdeacon, John Scotus, who had been canonically elected. A hostile interchange followed; then, after the death of Alexander in 1181, his successor, Pope Lucius III, consented to a compromise by which Hugh got the bishopric and John became bishop of Dunkeld. In 1188, William secured a papal bull which declared that the Church of Scotland was directly subject only to Rome, thus rejecting the claims to supremacy put forward by the English archbishop.\nThe Treaty of Falaise remained in force for the next fifteen years. Then the English king Richard the Lionheart, needing money to take part in the Third Crusade, agreed to terminate it in return for 10,000 silver marks (\u00a36,500), on 5 December 1189. William was then able to address the turbulent chiefs in the outlying parts of his kingdom. His authority was recognized in Galloway which, hitherto, had been practically independent; he put an end to a formidable insurrection in Moray and Inverness; and a series of campaigns brought the far north, Caithness and Sutherland, under the power of the crown.\nWilliam attempted to purchase Northumbria from Richard in 1194, as he had a strong claim over it. However, his offer of 15,000 marks (\u00a39,750) was rejected due to wanting the castles within the lands, which Richard was not willing to give. In 1200, William did homage for Northumbria, not for Scotland, to Richard's successor, John, apparently to save face.\nDespite the Scots regaining their independence, Anglo-Scottish relations remained tense during the first decade of the 13th century. In August 1209, King John decided to flex the English muscles by marching a large army to Norham (near Berwick), to exploit the flagging leadership of the ageing Scottish monarch. As well as promising a large sum of money, the ailing William agreed to his elder daughters marrying English nobles and, when the treaty was renewed in 1212, John apparently gained the hand of William's only surviving legitimate son, and heir, Alexander, for his eldest daughter, Joan.\nMarriage and issue.\nDue to the terms of the Treaty of Falaise, Henry II had the right to choose William's bride. In 1184, William attended Henry II's court to request a marriage to Henry's granddaughter Matilda of Saxony, daughter of Duke Henry the Lion of Saxony and Matilda of England. The proposal was referred to the pope and was forbidden on the grounds of consanguinity.\nHenry instead chose Ermengarde de Beaumont, a great-granddaughter of King Henry I of England, although through an illegitimate line. They married at Woodstock Palace on 5 September 1186. Edinburgh Castle was her dowry and Henry II paid for the four days of festivities. After the wedding she was escorted to Scotland by Scottish nobles and Jocelin, Bishop of Glasgow.\nThe marriage was not very successful, and it was many years before they had an heir. William and Ermengarde's children were:\nOut of wedlock, William I had numerous illegitimate children, their descendants being among those who would lay claim to the Scottish crown.\nBy a daughter, name unknown, of Adam de Hythus:\nBy Isabel d'Avenel:\nDeath and legacy.\nWilliam died on 4 December 1214 and was succeeded by his son Alexander.\nDespite continued dependence on English goodwill, William's reign showed much achievement. He threw himself into government with energy and diligently followed the lines laid down by his grandfather, David I. Anglo-French settlements and feudalization were extended, new burghs were founded (for example Perth in 1210), criminal law was clarified, the responsibilities of justices and sheriffs were widened, and trade grew. Traditionally, William is credited with founding Arbroath Abbey, the site of the later Declaration of Arbroath. The Bishopric of Argyll was established (c. 1192) in the same year as papal confirmation of the Scottish church by Pope Celestine III.\nWilliam was not known as \"the Lion\" during his lifetime, and the title did not relate to his tenacious character or his military prowess. It was attached to him because of his flag or standard, a red lion rampant with a forked tail () on a yellow background. This (with the substitution of a \"double tressure fleury counter-fleury\" border instead of an orle) went on to become the Royal Banner of Scotland, still used today but quartered with those of England and of Ireland. It became attached to him because the Scottish chronicler John of Fordun called him the \"Lion of Justice\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A descendant of Rollo, he was Duke of Normandy (as William II) from 1035 onward. By 1060, following a long struggle, his hold on Normandy was secure. In 1066, following the death of Edward the Confessor, William invaded England, leading a Franco-Norman army to victory over the Anglo-Saxon forces of Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings, and suppressed subsequent English revolts in what has become known as the Norman Conquest. The rest of his life was marked by struggles to consolidate his hold over England and his continental lands, and by difficulties with his eldest son, Robert Curthose.\nWilliam was the son of the unmarried Duke Robert I of Normandy and his mistress Herleva. His illegitimate status and youth caused some difficulties for him after he succeeded his father, as did the anarchy which plagued the first years of his rule. During his childhood and adolescence, members of the Norman aristocracy battled each other, both for control of the child duke, and for their own ends. In 1047, William quashed a rebellion and began to establish his authority over the duchy, a process that was not complete until about 1060. His marriage in the 1050s to Matilda of Flanders provided him with a powerful ally in the neighbouring county of Flanders. By the time of his marriage, William was able to arrange the appointment of his supporters as bishops and abbots in the Norman church. His consolidation of power allowed him to expand his horizons, and he secured control of the neighbouring county of Maine by 1062.\nIn the 1050s and early 1060s, William became a contender for the throne of England held by the childless Edward the Confessor, his first cousin once removed. There were other potential claimants, including the powerful English earl Harold Godwinson, whom Edward named as king on his deathbed in January 1066. Arguing that Edward had previously promised the throne to him and that Harold had sworn to support his claim, William built a large fleet and invaded England in September 1066. He decisively defeated and killed Harold at the Battle of Hastings on 14 October 1066. After further military efforts, William was crowned king on Christmas Day, 1066, in London. He made arrangements for the governance of England in early 1067 before returning to Normandy. Several unsuccessful rebellions followed, but William's hold on England was mostly secure by 1075, allowing him to spend the greater part of his reign in continental Europe.\nWilliam's final years were marked by difficulties in his continental domains, troubles with his son, Robert, and threatened invasions of England by the Danes. In 1086, he ordered the compilation of the \"Domesday Book\", a survey listing all of the land-holdings in England along with their pre-Conquest and current holders. He died in September 1087 while leading a campaign in northern France, and was buried in Caen. His reign in England was marked by the construction of castles, settling a new Norman nobility on the land, and change in the composition of the English clergy. He did not try to integrate his domains into one empire but continued to administer each part separately. His lands were divided after his death: Normandy went to Robert, and England went to his second surviving son, William Rufus.\nBackground.\nNorsemen first began raiding in what became Normandy in the late 8th century. Permanent Scandinavian settlement occurred before 911, when Rollo, one of the Viking leaders, and King Charles the Simple of France reached an agreement ceding the county of Rouen to Rollo. The lands around Rouen became the core of the later duchy of Normandy. Normandy may have been used as a base when Scandinavian attacks on England were renewed at the end of the 10th century, which would have worsened relations between England and Normandy. In an effort to improve matters, King \u00c6thelred the Unready took Emma, sister of Richard II, Duke of Normandy, as his second wife in 1002.\nDanish raids on England continued, and \u00c6thelred sought help from Richard, taking refuge in Normandy in 1013 when King Swein I of Denmark drove \u00c6thelred and his family from England. Swein's death in 1014 allowed \u00c6thelred to return home, but Swein's son Cnut contested \u00c6thelred's return. \u00c6thelred died unexpectedly in 1016, and Cnut became king of England. \u00c6thelred and Emma's two sons, Edward and Alfred, went into exile in Normandy while their mother, Emma, became Cnut's second wife.\nAfter Cnut's death in 1035, the English throne fell to Harold Harefoot, his son by his first wife, while Harthacnut, his son by Emma, became king in Denmark. England remained unstable. Alfred returned to England in 1036 to visit his mother and perhaps to challenge Harold as king. One story implicates Earl Godwin of Wessex in Alfred's subsequent death, but others blame Harold. Emma went into exile in Flanders until Harthacnut became king following Harold's death in 1040, and his half-brother Edward followed Harthacnut to England; Edward was proclaimed king after Harthacnut's death in June 1042.\nEarly life.\nWilliam was born in 1027 or 1028 at Falaise, Duchy of Normandy, most likely towards the end of 1028. He was the only son of Robert I, son of Richard II. His mother, Herleva, was a daughter of Fulbert of Falaise, who may have been a tanner or embalmer. Herleva was possibly a member of the ducal household, but did not marry Robert. She later married Herluin de Conteville, with whom she had two sons\u00a0\u2013 Odo of Bayeux and Count Robert of Mortain\u00a0\u2013 and a daughter whose name is unknown. One of Herleva's brothers, Walter, became a supporter and protector of William during his minority. Robert I also had a daughter, Adelaide, by another mistress.\nRobert I succeeded his elder brother Richard III as duke on 6 August 1027. The brothers had been at odds over the succession, and Richard's death was sudden. Robert was accused by some writers of killing Richard, a plausible but now unprovable charge. Conditions in Normandy were unsettled, as noble families despoiled the Church and Alan III of Brittany waged war against the duchy, possibly in an attempt to take control. By 1031 Robert had gathered considerable support from noblemen many of whom would become prominent during William's life. They included the duke's uncle Robert, the archbishop of Rouen, who had originally opposed the duke; Osbern, a nephew of Gunnor the wife of Richard I; and Gilbert of Brionne, a grandson of Richard I. After his accession, Robert continued Norman support for the English princes Edward and Alfred, who were still in exile in northern France.\nRobert may have been briefly betrothed to a daughter of King Cnut, but no marriage took place. It is unclear whether William would have been supplanted in the ducal succession if Robert had had a legitimate son. Earlier dukes had been illegitimate, and William's association with his father on ducal charters appears to indicate that William was considered Robert's most likely heir. In 1034 the duke decided to go on pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Although some of his supporters tried to dissuade him, he convened a council in January 1035 and had the assembled Norman magnates swear fealty to William as his heir before leaving for Jerusalem. He died in early July at Nicaea, on his way back to Normandy.\nDuke of Normandy.\nChallenges.\nWilliam faced several challenges on becoming duke, including his illegitimate birth and his youth: he was either seven or eight years old. He enjoyed the support of his great-uncle, Archbishop Robert, as well as King Henry I of France, enabling him to succeed to his father's duchy. The support given to the exiled English princes in their attempt to return to England in 1036 shows that the new duke's guardians were attempting to continue his father's policies, but Archbishop Robert's death in March 1037 removed one of William's main supporters, and Normandy quickly descended into chaos.\nThe anarchy in the duchy lasted until 1047, and control of the young duke was one of the priorities of those contending for power. At first, Alan of Brittany had custody of the duke, but when Alan died in either late 1039 or October 1040, Gilbert of Brionne took charge of William. Gilbert was killed within months, and another guardian, Turchetil, was also killed around the time of Gilbert's death. Yet another guardian, Osbern, was slain in the early 1040s in William's chamber while the duke slept. It was said that Walter, William's maternal uncle, was occasionally forced to hide the young duke in the houses of peasants, although this story may be an embellishment by Orderic Vitalis. The historian Eleanor Searle speculates that William was raised with the three cousins who later became important in his career\u00a0\u2013 William fitzOsbern, Roger de Beaumont, and Roger of Montgomery. Although many of the Norman nobles engaged in their own private wars and feuds during William's minority, the viscounts still acknowledged the ducal government, and the ecclesiastical hierarchy was supportive of William.\nKing Henry continued to support the young duke, but in late 1046 opponents of William came together in a rebellion centred in lower Normandy, led by Guy of Burgundy with support from Nigel, Viscount of the Cotentin, and Ranulf, Viscount of the Bessin. According to stories that may have legendary elements, an attempt was made to seize William at Valognes, but he escaped under cover of darkness, seeking refuge with King Henry. In early 1047 Henry and William returned to Normandy and were victorious at the Battle of Val-\u00e8s-Dunes near Caen, although few details of the fighting are recorded. William of Poitiers claimed that the battle was won mainly through William's efforts, but earlier accounts claim that King Henry's men and leadership also played an important part. William assumed power in Normandy, and shortly after the battle promulgated the Truce of God throughout his duchy, in an effort to limit warfare and violence by restricting the days of the year on which fighting was permitted. Although the Battle of Val-\u00e8s-Dunes marked a turning point in William's control of the duchy, it was not the end of his struggle to gain the upper hand over the nobility. The period from 1047 to 1054 saw almost continuous warfare, with lesser crises continuing until 1060.\nConsolidation of power.\nWilliam's next efforts were against Guy of Burgundy, who retreated to his castle at Brionne, which William besieged. After a long effort, the duke succeeded in exiling Guy in 1050. To address the growing power of the Count of Anjou, Geoffrey Martel, William joined with King Henry in a campaign against him, the last known cooperation between the two. They succeeded in capturing an Angevin fortress but accomplished little else. Geoffrey attempted to expand his authority into the county of Maine, especially after the death of Hugh IV of Maine in 1051. Central to the control of Maine were the holdings of the Bell\u00eame family, who held Bell\u00eame on the border of Maine and Normandy, as well as the fortresses at Alen\u00e7on and Domfront. Bell\u00eame's overlord was the king of France, but Domfront was under the overlordship of Geoffrey Martel and Duke William was Alen\u00e7on's overlord. The Bell\u00eame family, whose lands were quite strategically placed between their three different overlords, were able to play each of them against the other and secure virtual independence for themselves.\nOn the death of Hugh of Maine, Geoffrey Martel occupied Maine in a move contested by William and King Henry; eventually, they succeeded in driving Geoffrey from the county, and in the process, William secured the Bell\u00eame family strongholds at Alen\u00e7on and Domfront for himself. He was thus able to assert his overlordship over the Bell\u00eame family and compel them to act consistently with Norman interests. However, in 1052 the king and Geoffrey Martel made common cause against William as some Norman nobles began to contest William's increasing power. Henry's about-face was probably motivated by a desire to retain dominance over Normandy, which was now threatened by William's growing mastery of his duchy. William was engaged in military actions against his own nobles throughout 1053, as well as with the new Archbishop of Rouen, Mauger.\nIn February 1054 the king and the Norman rebels launched a double invasion of the duchy. Henry led the main thrust through the county of \u00c9vreux, while the other wing, under the king's half-brother Odo, invaded eastern Normandy. William met the invasion by dividing his forces into two. The first, which he led, faced Henry. The second, which included some who became William's firm supporters, such as Robert, Count of Eu, Walter Giffard, Roger of Mortemer, and William de Warenne, faced the other invading force. This second force defeated the invaders at the Battle of Mortemer. In addition to ending both invasions, the battle allowed the duke's ecclesiastical supporters to depose Archbishop Mauger. Mortemer thus marked another turning point in William's growing control of the duchy, although his conflict with the French king and the Count of Anjou continued until 1060. Henry and Geoffrey led another invasion of Normandy in 1057 but were defeated by William at the Battle of Varaville. This was the last invasion of Normandy during William's lifetime. In 1058, William invaded the County of Dreux and took Tilli\u00e8res-sur-Avre and Thimert. Henry attempted to dislodge William, but the siege of Thimert dragged on for two years until Henry's death. The deaths of Count Geoffrey and the king in 1060 cemented the shift in the balance of power towards William.\nOne factor in William's favour was his marriage to Matilda of Flanders, the daughter of Count Baldwin V of Flanders. The union was arranged in 1049, but Pope Leo IX forbade the marriage at the Council of Rheims in October 1049. The marriage nevertheless went ahead in the early 1050s, possibly unsanctioned by the pope. According to a late source not generally considered to be reliable, papal sanction was not secured until 1059, but as papal-Norman relations in the 1050s were generally good, and Norman clergy were able to visit Rome in 1050 without incident, it was probably secured earlier. Papal sanction of the marriage appears to have required the founding of two monasteries in Caen\u00a0\u2013 one by William and one by Matilda. The marriage was important in bolstering William's status, as Flanders was one of the more powerful French territories, with ties to the French royal house and to the German emperors. Contemporary writers considered the marriage, which produced four sons and five or six daughters, to be a success.\nAppearance and character.\nNo authentic portrait of William has been found; the contemporary depictions of him on the Bayeux Tapestry and on his seals and coins are conventional representations designed to assert his authority. There are some written descriptions of a burly and robust appearance, with a guttural voice. He enjoyed excellent health until old age, although he became quite fat in later life. He was strong enough to draw bows that others were unable to pull and had great stamina. Geoffrey Martel described him as without equal as a fighter and horseman. Examination of William's femur, the only bone to survive when the rest of his remains were destroyed, showed he was approximately tall.\nThere are records of two tutors for William during the late 1030s and early 1040s, but the extent of his literary education is unclear. He was not known as a patron of authors, and there is little evidence that he sponsored scholarships or intellectual activities. Orderic Vitalis records that William tried to learn to read Old English late in life, but he was unable to devote sufficient time to the effort and quickly gave up. William's main hobby appears to have been hunting. His marriage to Matilda appears to have been quite affectionate, and there are no signs that he was unfaithful to her\u00a0\u2013 unusual in a medieval monarch. Medieval writers criticised William for his greed and cruelty, but his personal piety was universally praised by contemporaries.\nNorman administration.\nNorman government under William was similar to the government that had existed under earlier dukes. It was a fairly simple administrative system, built around the ducal household, a group of officers including stewards, butlers, and marshals. The duke travelled constantly around the duchy, confirming charters and collecting revenues. Most of the income came from the ducal lands, as well as from tolls and a few taxes. This income was collected by the chamber, one of the household departments.\nWilliam cultivated close relations with the church in his duchy. He took part in church councils and made several appointments to the Norman episcopate, including the appointment of Maurilius as Archbishop of Rouen. Another important appointment was that of William's half-brother, Odo, as Bishop of Bayeux in 1049 or 1050. He also relied on the clergy for advice, including Lanfranc, a non-Norman who rose to become one of William's prominent ecclesiastical advisors from the late 1040s through the 1060s. William gave generously to the church; from 1035 to 1066, the Norman aristocracy founded at least twenty new monastic houses, including William's two monasteries in Caen, a remarkable expansion of religious life in the duchy.\nEnglish and continental concerns.\nIn 1051 the childless King Edward of England appears to have chosen William as his successor. William was the grandson of Edward's maternal uncle, Richard II of Normandy.\nThe \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", in the \"D\" version, states that William visited England in the later part of 1051, perhaps to secure confirmation of the succession, or perhaps to secure aid for his troubles in Normandy. The trip is unlikely given William's absorption in warfare with Anjou at the time. Whatever Edward's wishes, it was likely that any claim by William would be opposed by Godwin, Earl of Wessex, a member of the most powerful family in England. Edward had married Edith, Godwin's daughter, in 1043, and Godwin appears to have been one of the main supporters of Edward's claim to the throne. By 1050, however, relations between the king and the earl had soured, culminating in a crisis in 1051 that led to the exile of Godwin and his family from England. During this exile, Edward offered the throne to William. Godwin returned from exile in 1052 with armed forces, and a settlement was reached between the king and the earl, restoring the earl and his family to their lands and replacing Robert of Jumi\u00e8ges, a Norman whom Edward had named Archbishop of Canterbury, with Stigand, the Bishop of Winchester. No English source mentions a supposed embassy by Archbishop Robert to William conveying the promise of the succession, and the two Norman sources that mention it, William of Jumi\u00e8ges and William of Poitiers, are not precise in their chronology of when this visit took place.\nCount Herbert II of Maine died in 1062, and William, who had betrothed his eldest son Robert to Herbert's sister Margaret, claimed the county through his son. Local nobles resisted the claim, but William invaded and by 1064 had secured control of the area. William appointed a Norman to the bishopric of Le Mans in 1065. He also allowed his son Robert Curthose to do homage to the new Count of Anjou, Geoffrey the Bearded. William's western border was thus secured, but his border with Brittany remained insecure. In 1064 William invaded Brittany in a campaign that remains obscure in its details. Its effect, though, was to destabilise Brittany, forcing the duke, Conan II, to focus on internal problems rather than on expansion. Conan's death in 1066 further secured William's borders in Normandy. William also benefited from his campaign in Brittany by securing the support of some Breton nobles who went on to support the invasion of England in 1066.\nEarl Godwin died in 1053. Harold succeeded to his father's earldom, and another son, Tostig, became Earl of Northumbria. Other sons were granted earldoms later: Gyrth as Earl of East Anglia in 1057 and Leofwine as Earl of Kent sometime between 1055 and 1057. Some sources claim that Harold took part in William's Breton campaign of 1064 and swore to uphold William's claim to the English throne, but no English source reports this trip, and it is unclear if it actually occurred. It may have been Norman propaganda designed to discredit Harold, who had emerged as the main contender to succeed King Edward. Meanwhile, another contender for the throne had emerged\u00a0\u2013 Edward the Exile, son of Edmund Ironside and a grandson of \u00c6thelred II, returned to England in 1057. Although he died shortly after his return, he brought with him his family, which included two daughters, Margaret and Christina, and a son, Edgar the \u00c6theling.\nIn 1065 Northumbria revolted against Tostig, and the rebels chose Morcar, the younger brother of Edwin, Earl of Mercia, as earl. Harold, perhaps to secure the support of Edwin and Morcar in his bid for the throne, supported the rebels and persuaded King Edward to replace Tostig with Morcar. Tostig went into exile in Flanders with his wife Judith, who was the daughter of Baldwin IV, Count of Flanders. Edward was ailing, and he died on 5 January 1066. It is unclear what exactly happened at Edward's deathbed. One story, deriving from the \"Vita \u00c6dwardi\", a biography of Edward, claims that he was attended by his wife Edith, Harold, Archbishop Stigand, and Robert FitzWimarc, and that the king named Harold as his successor. The Norman sources do not dispute that Harold was named as the next king, but they declare that Harold's oath and Edward's earlier promise of the throne could not be changed on Edward's deathbed. Later English sources stated that Harold had been elected as king by the clergy and magnates of England.\nInvasion of England.\nHarold's preparations.\nHarold was crowned on 6 January 1066 in Edward's new Norman-style Westminster Abbey, although some controversy surrounds who performed the ceremony. English sources claim that Ealdred, the Archbishop of York, performed the ceremony, while Norman sources state that the coronation was performed by Stigand, who was considered a non-canonical archbishop by the papacy. Harold's claim to the throne was not entirely secure, as there were other claimants, perhaps including his exiled brother Tostig. King Harald Hardrada of Norway also had a claim to the throne as the uncle and heir of King Magnus I, who had made a pact with Harthacnut around 1040 that if either Magnus or Harthacnut died without heirs, the other would succeed. The last claimant was William of Normandy, against whose anticipated invasion King Harold Godwinson made most of his preparations.\nHarold's brother Tostig made probing attacks along the southern coast of England in May 1066, landing at the Isle of Wight using a fleet supplied by Baldwin of Flanders. Tostig appears to have received little local support, and further raids into Lincolnshire and near the Humber met with no more success, so he retreated to Scotland. According to the Norman writer William of Jumi\u00e8ges, William had meanwhile sent an embassy to King Harold Godwinson to remind Harold of his oath to support William's claim, although whether this embassy actually occurred is unclear. Harold assembled an army and a fleet to repel William's anticipated invasion force, deploying troops and ships along the English Channel for most of the summer.\nWilliam's preparations.\nWilliam of Poitiers describes a council called by Duke William, in which the writer gives an account of a debate between William's nobles and supporters over whether to risk an invasion of England. Although some sort of formal assembly probably was held, it is unlikely that any debate took place: the duke had by then established control over his nobles, and most of those assembled would have been anxious to secure their share of the rewards from the conquest of England. William of Poitiers also relates that the duke obtained the consent of Pope Alexander II for the invasion, along with a papal banner. The chronicler also claimed that the duke secured the support of Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor, and King Sweyn II of Denmark. Henry was still a minor, however, and Sweyn was more likely to support Harold, who could then help Sweyn against the Norwegian king, so these claims should be treated with caution. Although Alexander gave papal approval to the conquest after it succeeded, no other source claims papal support prior to the invasion. Events after the invasion, which included the penance William performed and statements by later popes, lend circumstantial support to the claim of papal approval. To deal with Norman affairs, William put the government of Normandy into the hands of his wife for the duration of the invasion.\nThroughout the summer, William assembled an army and an invasion fleet in Normandy. Although William of Jumi\u00e8ges's claim that the ducal fleet numbered 3,000 ships is clearly an exaggeration, it was probably large and mostly built from scratch. Although William of Poitiers and William of Jumi\u00e8ges disagree about where the fleet was built\u00a0\u2013 Poitiers states it was constructed at the mouth of the River Dives, while Jumi\u00e8ges states it was built at Saint-Valery-sur-Somme\u00a0\u2013 both agree that it eventually sailed from Valery-sur-Somme. The fleet carried an invasion force that included, in addition to troops from William's territories of Normandy and Maine, large numbers of mercenaries, allies, and volunteers from Brittany, northeastern France, and Flanders, together with smaller numbers from other parts of Europe. Although the army and fleet were ready by early August, adverse winds kept the ships in Normandy until late September. There were probably other reasons for William's delay, including intelligence reports from England revealing that Harold's forces were deployed along the coast. William would have preferred to delay the invasion until he could make an unopposed landing. Harold kept his forces on alert throughout the summer, but with the arrival of the harvest season he disbanded his army on 8 September.\nTostig and Hardrada's invasion.\nTostig Godwinson and Harald Hardrada invaded Northumbria in September 1066 and defeated the local forces under Morcar and Edwin at the Battle of Fulford near York. King Harold received word of their invasion and marched north, defeating the invaders and killing Tostig and Hardrada on 25 September at the Battle of Stamford Bridge. The Norman fleet finally set sail two days later, landing in England at Pevensey Bay on 28 September. William then moved to Hastings, a few miles to the east, where he built a castle as a base of operations. From there, he ravaged the interior and waited for Harold's return from the north, refusing to venture far from the sea, his line of communication with Normandy.\nBattle of Hastings.\nAfter defeating Harald Hardrada and Tostig, Harold left much of his army in the north, including Morcar and Edwin, and marched the rest south to deal with the threatened Norman invasion. He probably learned of William's landing while he was travelling south. Harold stopped in London for about a week before marching to Hastings, so it is likely that he spent about a week on his march south, averaging about per day, for the distance of approximately . Although Harold attempted to surprise the Normans, William's scouts reported the English arrival to the duke. The exact events preceding the battle are obscure, with contradictory accounts in the sources, but all agree that William led his army from his castle and advanced towards the enemy. Harold had taken a defensive position at the top of Senlac Hill (present-day Battle, East Sussex), about from William's castle at Hastings.\nThe battle began at about 9\u00a0am on 14 October and lasted all day. While a broad outline is known, the exact events are obscured by contradictory accounts. Although the numbers on each side were about equal, William had both cavalry and infantry, including many archers, while Harold had only foot soldiers and few, if any, archers. The English soldiers formed up as a shield wall along the ridge and were at first so effective that William's army was thrown back with heavy casualties. Some of William's Breton troops panicked and fled, and some of the English troops appear to have pursued the fleeing Bretons until they themselves were attacked and destroyed by Norman cavalry. During the Bretons' flight, rumours swept through the Norman forces that the duke had been killed, but William succeeded in rallying his troops. Two further Norman retreats were feigned, to draw the English into pursuit and expose them to repeated attacks by the Norman cavalry. The available sources are more confused about events in the afternoon, but it appears that the decisive event was Harold's death, about which differing stories are told. William of Jumi\u00e8ges claimed that Harold was killed by the duke. The Bayeux Tapestry has been claimed to show Harold's death by an arrow to the eye, but that may be a later reworking of the tapestry to conform to 12th-century stories in which Harold was slain by an arrow wound to the head.\nHarold's body was identified the day after the battle, either through his armour or marks on his body. The English dead, including some of Harold's brothers and his housecarls, were left on the battlefield. Gytha Thorkelsd\u00f3ttir, Harold's mother, offered the duke the weight of her son's body in gold for it, but her offer was refused. William ordered the body thrown into the sea, but whether that took place is unclear. Waltham Abbey, which Harold founded, later claimed that his body had been secretly buried there.\nMarch on London.\nWilliam may have hoped the English would surrender following his victory, but they did not. Instead, some of the English clergy and magnates nominated Edgar the \u00c6theling as king, though their support for Edgar was only lukewarm. After waiting a short while, William secured Dover, parts of Kent, and Canterbury, while also sending a force to capture Winchester, where the royal treasury was. These captures secured William's rear areas and his line of retreat to Normandy, if that was needed. William then marched to Southwark, across the Thames from London, which he reached in late November. Next, he led his forces around the south and west of London, burning along the way. He finally crossed the Thames at Wallingford in early December. Stigand submitted to William there, and when the duke moved on to Berkhamsted soon afterwards, Edgar the \u00c6theling, Morcar, Edwin, and Ealdred also submitted. William then sent forces into London to construct a castle; he was crowned at Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day 1066.\nConsolidation.\nFirst actions.\nWilliam remained in England after his coronation and tried to reconcile the native magnates. The remaining earls\u00a0\u2013 Edwin (of Mercia), Morcar (of Northumbria), and Waltheof (of Northampton)\u00a0\u2013 were confirmed in their lands and titles. Waltheof was married to William's niece Judith, daughter of his half-sister Adelaide, and a marriage between Edwin and one of William's daughters was proposed. Edgar the \u00c6theling also appears to have been given lands. Ecclesiastical offices continued to be held by the same bishops as before the invasion, including the uncanonical Stigand. But the families of Harold and his brothers lost their lands, as did some others who had fought against William at Hastings. By March, William was secure enough to return to Normandy, but he took with him Stigand, Morcar, Edwin, Edgar, and Waltheof. He left his half-brother Odo, the Bishop of Bayeux, in charge of England along with another influential supporter, William fitzOsbern, the son of his former guardian. Both men were also named to earldoms\u00a0\u2013 fitzOsbern to Hereford (or Wessex) and Odo to Kent. Although he put two Normans in overall charge, he retained many of the native English sheriffs. Once in Normandy the new English king went to Rouen and the Abbey of Fecamp, and then attended the consecration of new churches at two Norman monasteries.\nWhile William was in Normandy, a former ally, Eustace, the Count of Boulogne, invaded at Dover but was repulsed. English resistance had also begun, with Eadric the Wild attacking Hereford and revolts at Exeter, where Harold's mother Gytha was a focus of resistance. FitzOsbern and Odo found it difficult to control the native population and undertook a programme of castle-building to maintain their hold on the kingdom. William returned to England in December 1067 and marched on Exeter, which he besieged. The town held out for 18 days. After it fell to William he built a castle to secure his control. Harold's sons were meanwhile raiding the southwest of England from a base in Ireland. Their forces landed near Bristol but were defeated by Eadnoth. By Easter, William was at Winchester, where he was soon joined by his wife Matilda, who was crowned in May 1068.\nEnglish resistance.\nIn 1068 Edwin and Morcar rose in revolt, supported by Gospatric, Earl of Northumbria. Orderic Vitalis states that Edwin's reason for revolting was that the proposed marriage between himself and one of William's daughters had not taken place, but another reason probably included the increasing power of fitzOsbern in Herefordshire, which affected Edwin's power within his own earldom. The king marched through Edwin's lands and built Warwick Castle. Edwin and Morcar submitted, but William continued on to York, building York and Nottingham Castles before returning south. On his southbound journey, he began constructing Lincoln, Huntingdon, and Cambridge Castles. William placed supporters in charge of these new fortifications\u00a0\u2013 among them William Peverel at Nottingham and Henry de Beaumont at Warwick\u00a0\u2013 then returned to Normandy late in 1068.\nEarly in 1069, Edgar the \u00c6theling revolted and attacked York. Although William returned to York and built another castle, Edgar remained free, and in the autumn he joined up with King Sweyn. The Danish king had brought a large fleet to England and attacked not only York but Exeter and Shrewsbury. York was captured by the combined forces of Edgar and Sweyn. Edgar was proclaimed king by his supporters. William responded swiftly, ignoring a continental revolt in Maine, and symbolically wore his crown in the ruins of York on Christmas Day 1069. He then bought off the Danes. He marched to the River Tees, ravaging the countryside as he went. Edgar, having lost much of his support, fled to Scotland, where King Malcolm III was married to Edgar's sister Margaret. Waltheof, who had joined the revolt, submitted, along with Gospatric, and both were allowed to retain their lands. William marched over the Pennines during the winter and defeated the remaining rebels at Shrewsbury before building Chester and Stafford Castles. This campaign, which included the burning and destruction of part of the countryside that the royal forces marched through, is usually known as the \"Harrying of the North\"; it was over by April 1070, when William wore his crown ceremonially for Easter at Winchester.\nChurch affairs.\nWhile at Winchester in 1070, William met with three papal legates\u00a0\u2013 John Minutus, Peter, and Ermenfrid of Sion\u00a0\u2013 who had been sent by the pope. The legates ceremonially crowned William during the Easter court. The historian David Bates sees this coronation as the ceremonial papal \"seal of approval\" for William's conquest. The legates and the king then held a series of ecclesiastical councils dedicated to reforming and reorganising the English church. Stigand and his brother, \u00c6thelm\u00e6r, the Bishop of Elmham, were deposed from their bishoprics. Some of the native abbots were also deposed, both at the council held near Easter and at a further one near Whitsun. The Whitsun council saw the appointment of Lanfranc as the new Archbishop of Canterbury, and Thomas of Bayeux as the new Archbishop of York, to replace Ealdred, who had died in September 1069. William's half-brother Odo perhaps expected to be appointed to Canterbury, but William probably did not wish to give that much power to a family member. Another reason for the appointment may have been pressure from the papacy to appoint Lanfranc. Norman clergy were appointed to replace the deposed bishops and abbots, and at the end of the process, only native English bishops remained in office, along with several continental prelates appointed by Edward the Confessor. In 1070 William also founded Battle Abbey, a new monastery at the site of the Battle of Hastings, partly as a penance for the deaths in the battle and partly as a memorial to the dead. At an ecclesiastical council held in Lillebonne in 1080, he was confirmed in his ultimate authority over the Norman church.\nTroubles in England and on the Continent.\nDanish raids and rebellion.\nAlthough Sweyn had promised to leave England, he returned in early 1070, raiding along the Humber and East Anglia toward the Isle of Ely, where he joined up with Hereward the Wake, a local thegn. Hereward's forces captured and looted Peterborough Abbey. William was able to secure the departure of Sweyn and his fleet in 1070, allowing him to return to the continent to deal with troubles in Maine, where the town of Le Mans had revolted in 1069. Another concern was the death of Count Baldwin VI of Flanders in July 1070, which led to a succession crisis as his widow, Richilde, was ruling for their two young sons, Arnulf and Baldwin. Her rule was contested by Robert, Baldwin's brother. Richilde proposed marriage to William fitzOsbern, who was in Normandy, and fitzOsbern accepted. But after he was killed in February 1071 at the Battle of Cassel, Robert became count. He was opposed to King William's power on the continent, thus the Battle of Cassel upset the balance of power in northern France and cost William an important supporter.\nIn 1071 William defeated the last rebellion of the north. Earl Edwin was betrayed by his own men and killed, while William built a causeway to subdue the Isle of Ely, where Hereward the Wake and Morcar were hiding. Hereward escaped, but Morcar was captured, deprived of his earldom, and imprisoned. In 1072 William invaded Scotland, defeating Malcolm, who had recently invaded the north of England. William and Malcolm agreed to peace by signing the Treaty of Abernethy, and Malcolm probably gave up his son Duncan as a hostage for the peace. Perhaps another stipulation of the treaty was the expulsion of Edgar the \u00c6theling from Malcolm's court. William then turned his attention to the continent, returning to Normandy in early 1073 to deal with the invasion of Maine by Fulk le Rechin, the Count of Anjou. With a swift campaign, William seized Le Mans from Fulk's forces, completing the campaign by 30 March 1073. This made William's power more secure in northern France, but the new count of Flanders accepted Edgar the \u00c6theling into his court. Robert also married his half-sister Bertha to King Philip I of France, who was opposed to Norman power.\nWilliam returned to England to release his army from service in 1073 but quickly returned to Normandy, where he spent all of 1074. He left England in the hands of his supporters, including Richard fitzGilbert and William de Warenne, as well as Lanfranc. William's ability to leave England for an entire year was a sign that he felt that his control of the kingdom was secure. While William was in Normandy, Edgar the \u00c6theling returned to Scotland from Flanders. The French king, seeking a focus for those opposed to William's power, proposed that Edgar be given the castle of Montreuil-sur-Mer on the Channel, which would have given Edgar a strategic advantage against William. However, Edgar was forced to submit to William shortly thereafter, and he returned to William's court. Philip, although thwarted in this attempt, turned his attentions to Brittany, leading to a revolt in 1075.\nRevolt of the Earls.\nIn 1075, during William's absence, Ralph de Gael, the Earl of Norfolk, and Roger de Breteuil, the Earl of Hereford, conspired to overthrow William in the \"Revolt of the Earls\". Ralph was at least part Breton and had spent most of his life prior to 1066 in Brittany, where he still had lands. Roger was a Norman, son of William fitzOsbern, but had inherited less authority than his father held. Ralph's authority seems also to have been less than his predecessors in the earldom, and this was likely the cause of his involvement in the revolt.\nThe exact reason for the rebellion is unclear. It was launched at the wedding of Ralph to a relative of Roger, held at Exning in Suffolk. Waltheof, the earl of Northumbria, although one of William's favourites, was involved, and some Breton lords were ready to rebel in support of Ralph and Roger. Ralph also requested Danish aid. William remained in Normandy while his men in England subdued the revolt. Roger was unable to leave his stronghold in Herefordshire because of efforts by Wulfstan, the Bishop of Worcester, and \u00c6thelwig, the Abbot of Evesham. Ralph was bottled up in Norwich Castle by the combined efforts of Odo of Bayeux, Geoffrey de Montbray, Richard fitzGilbert, and William de Warenne. Ralph eventually left Norwich in the control of his wife and left England, ending up in Brittany. Norwich was besieged and surrendered, with the garrison allowed to go to Brittany. Meanwhile, the Danish king's brother, Cnut, had finally arrived in England with a fleet of 200 ships, but Norwich had already surrendered. The Danes raided along the coast before returning home. William returned to England later in 1075 to deal with the Danish threat, leaving his wife Matilda in charge of Normandy. He celebrated Christmas at Winchester and dealt with the aftermath of the rebellion. Roger and Waltheof were kept in prison, where Waltheof was executed in May 1076. Before this, William had returned to the continent, where Ralph had continued the rebellion from Brittany.\nTroubles at home and abroad.\nEarl Ralph had secured control of the castle at Dol, and in September 1076 William advanced into Brittany and laid siege to the castle. King Philip of France later relieved the siege and defeated William at the Battle of Dol in 1076, forcing him to retreat to Normandy. Although this was William's first defeat in battle, it did little to change things. An Angevin attack on Maine was defeated in late 1076 or 1077, with Count Fulk le Rechin wounded in the unsuccessful attack. More serious was the retirement of Simon de Cr\u00e9py, the Count of Amiens, to a monastery. Before he became a monk, Simon handed his county of the Vexin over to King Philip. The Vexin was a buffer state between Normandy and the lands of the French king, and Simon had been a supporter of William. William was able to make peace with Philip in 1077 and secured a truce with Count Fulk in late 1077 or early 1078.\nIn late 1077 or early 1078 trouble began between William and his eldest son, Robert. Although Orderic Vitalis describes it as starting with a quarrel between Robert and his younger brothers William and Henry, including a story that the quarrel was started when William and Henry threw water at Robert, it is much more likely that Robert was feeling powerless. Orderic relates that he had previously demanded control of Maine and Normandy and had been rebuffed. The trouble in 1077 or 1078 resulted in Robert leaving Normandy accompanied by a band of young men, many of them the sons of William's supporters. Included among them were Robert of Belleme, William de Breteuil, and Roger, the son of Richard fitzGilbert. This band went to the castle at Remalard, where they proceeded to raid into Normandy. The raiders were supported by many of William's continental enemies. William immediately attacked the rebels and drove them from Remalard, but King Philip gave them the castle at Gerberoi, where they were joined by new supporters. William then laid siege to Gerberoi in January 1079. After three weeks, the besieged forces sallied from the castle and took the besiegers by surprise. William was unhorsed by Robert and was only saved from death by an Englishman, Toki son of Wigod, who was himself killed. William's forces were forced to lift the siege, and the king returned to Rouen. By 12 April 1080, William and Robert had reached an accommodation, with William once more affirming that Robert would receive Normandy when he died.\nWord of William's defeat at Gerberoi stirred up difficulties in northern England. In August and September 1079 King Malcolm of Scots raided south of the River Tweed, devastating the land between the River Tees and the Tweed in a raid that lasted almost a month. The lack of Norman response appears to have caused the Northumbrians to grow restive, and in the spring of 1080 they rebelled against the rule of Walcher, the Bishop of Durham and Earl of Northumbria. Walcher was killed on 14 May 1080, and the king dispatched his half-brother Odo to deal with the rebellion. William departed Normandy in July 1080, and in the autumn his son Robert was sent on a campaign against the Scots. Robert raided into Lothian and forced Malcolm to agree to terms, building the 'new castle' at Newcastle upon Tyne while returning to England. The king was at Gloucester for Christmas 1080 and at Winchester for Whitsun in 1081, ceremonially wearing his crown on both occasions. A papal embassy arrived in England during this period, asking that William do fealty for England to the papacy, a request that he rejected. William also visited Wales in 1081, although the English and the Welsh sources differ on the purpose of the visit. The \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" states that it was a military campaign, but Welsh sources record it as a pilgrimage to St Davids in honour of Saint David. William's biographer David Bates argues that the former explanation is more likely: the balance of power had recently shifted in Wales and William would have wished to take advantage of this to extend Norman power. By the end of 1081, William was back on the continent, dealing with disturbances in Maine. Although he led an expedition into Maine, the result was instead a negotiated settlement arranged by a papal legate.\nLast years.\nSources for William's actions between 1082 and 1084 are meagre. According to the historian David Bates, this probably means that little of note happened, and that because William was on the continent, there was nothing for the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" to record. In 1082, William ordered the arrest of his half-brother Odo. The exact reasons are unclear, as no contemporary author recorded what caused the quarrel between the half-brothers. Orderic Vitalis later recorded that Odo had aspirations to become pope and that Odo had attempted to persuade some of William's vassals to join Odo in an invasion of southern Italy. This would have been considered tampering with the king's authority over his vassals, which William would not have tolerated. Although Odo remained in confinement for the rest of William's reign, his lands were not confiscated. In 1083, William's son Robert rebelled once more with support from the French king. A further blow was the death of Queen Matilda on 2 November 1083. William was always described as close to his wife, and her death would have added to his problems.\nMaine continued to be difficult, with a rebellion by Hubert de Beaumont-au-Maine, probably in 1084. Hubert was besieged in his castle at Sainte-Suzanne by William's forces for at least two years, but he eventually made peace with the king and was restored to favour. William's movements during 1084 and 1085 are unclear\u00a0\u2013 he was in Normandy at Easter 1084 but may have been in England before then to collect the danegeld assessed that year for the defence of England against an invasion by King Cnut IV of Denmark. Although English and Norman forces remained on alert throughout 1085 and into 1086, the invasion threat was ended by Cnut's death in July 1086.\nWilliam as king.\nChanges in England.\nAs part of his efforts to secure England, William ordered many castles, keeps, and mottes built\u00a0\u2013 among them the central keep of the Tower of London, the White Tower. These fortifications allowed Normans to retreat into safety when threatened with rebellion and allowed garrisons to be protected while they occupied the countryside. The early castles were simple earth and timber constructions, later replaced with stone structures.\nAt first, most of the newly settled Normans kept household knights and did not settle their retainers with fiefs of their own, but gradually these household knights came to be granted lands of their own, a process known as subinfeudation. William also required his newly created magnates to contribute fixed quotas of knights towards not only military campaigns but also castle garrisons. This method of organising the military forces was a departure from the pre-Conquest English practice of basing military service on territorial units such as the hide.\nBy William's death, after weathering a series of rebellions, most of the native Anglo-Saxon aristocracy had been replaced by Norman and other continental magnates. Not all of the Normans who accompanied William in the initial conquest acquired large amounts of land in England. Some appear to have been reluctant to take up lands in a kingdom that did not always appear pacified. Although some of the newly rich Normans in England came from William's close family or from the upper Norman nobility, others were from relatively humble backgrounds. William granted some lands to his continental followers from the holdings of one or more specific Englishmen; at other times, he granted a compact grouping of lands previously held by many different Englishmen to one Norman follower, often to allow for the consolidation of lands around a strategically placed castle.\nThe medieval chronicler William of Malmesbury says that the king also seized and depopulated many miles of land (36 parishes), turning it into the royal New Forest to support his enthusiastic enjoyment of hunting. Modern historians have concluded that the New Forest depopulation was greatly exaggerated. Most of the New Forest comprises poor agricultural lands, and archaeological and geographic studies have shown that it was likely sparsely settled when it was turned into a royal forest. William was known for his love of hunting, and he introduced the forest law into areas of the country, regulating who could hunt and what could be hunted.\nAdministration.\nAfter 1066, William did not attempt to integrate his separate domains into one unified realm with one set of laws. His seal from after 1066, of which six impressions still survive, was made for him after he conquered England and stressed his role as king, while separately mentioning his role as duke. When in Normandy, William acknowledged that he owed fealty to the French king, but in England no such acknowledgement was made\u00a0\u2013 further evidence that the various parts of William's lands were considered separate. The administrative machinery of Normandy, England, and Maine continued to exist separate from the other lands, with each one retaining its own forms. For example, England continued the use of writs, which were not known on the continent. Also, the charters and documents produced for the government in Normandy differed in formulas from those produced in England.\nWilliam took over an English government that was more complex than the Norman system. England was divided into shires or counties, which were further divided into either hundreds or wapentakes. Each shire was administered by a royal official called a sheriff, who roughly had the same status as a Norman viscount. A sheriff was responsible for royal justice and collecting royal revenue. To oversee his expanded domain, William was forced to travel even more than he had as duke. He crossed back and forth between the continent and England at least 19 times between 1067 and his death. William spent most of his time in England between the Battle of Hastings and 1072; after that, he spent the majority of his time in Normandy. Government was still centred on William's household; when he was in one part of his realms, decisions would be made for other parts of his domains and transmitted through a communication system that made use of letters and other documents. William also appointed deputies who could make decisions while he was absent, especially if the absence was expected to be lengthy. Usually, this was a member of William's close family\u00a0\u2013 frequently his half-brother Odo or his wife Matilda. Sometimes deputies were appointed to deal with specific issues.\nWilliam continued the collection of danegeld, a land tax. This was an advantage for William and the only universal tax collected by western European rulers during this period. It was an annual tax based on the value of landholdings and could be collected at differing rates. Most years saw the rate of two shillings per hide, but in crises, it could be increased to as much as six shillings per hide. Coinage across his domains continued to be minted in different cycles and styles. English coins were generally of high silver content, with high artistic standards, and were required to be re-minted every three years. Norman coins had a much lower silver content, were often of poor artistic quality, and were rarely re-minted. In England, no other coinage was allowed, while on the continent other coinage was considered legal tender. Nor is there evidence that many English pennies were circulating in Normandy, which shows little attempt to integrate the monetary systems of England and Normandy.\nBesides taxation, William's large landholdings throughout England strengthened his rule. As King Edward's heir, he controlled all of the former royal lands. He also retained control of much of the lands of Harold and his family, which made the king the largest secular landowner in England by a wide margin.\nDomesday Book.\nAt Christmas 1085, William ordered the compilation of a survey of the landholdings held by himself and by his vassals throughout his kingdom, organised by counties. It resulted in a work now known as the \"Domesday Book\". The listing for each county gives the holdings of each landholder, grouped by owners. The listings describe the holding, who owned the land before the Conquest, its value, its tax assessment, and usually the number of peasants, ploughs, and any other resources the holding had. Towns were listed separately. All the English counties south of the River Tees and River Ribble are included. The whole work seems to have been mostly completed by 1 August 1086, when the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" records that William received the results and that all the chief magnates swore the Salisbury Oath, a renewal of their oaths of allegiance. William's motivation in ordering the survey is unclear, but it probably had several purposes, such as making a record of feudal obligations and justifying increased taxation.\nDeath and aftermath.\nWilliam left England towards the end of 1086. Following his arrival back on the continent he married his daughter Constance to Duke Alan of Brittany, in furtherance of his policy of seeking allies against the French kings. William's son Robert, still allied with the French king, appears to have been active in stirring up trouble, enough so that William led an expedition against the French Vexin in July 1087. While seizing Mantes, William either fell ill or was injured by the pommel of his saddle. He was taken to the priory of Saint Gervase at Rouen, where he died on 9 September 1087. Knowledge of the events preceding his death is confused because there are two different accounts. Orderic Vitalis preserves a lengthy account, complete with speeches made by many of the principals, but this is likely more of an account of how a king should die than of what actually happened. The other, the \"De obitu Willelmi\", or \"On the Death of William\", has been shown to be a copy of two 9th-century accounts with names changed.\nWilliam left Normandy to Robert, and the custody of England was given to William's second surviving son, also called William, on the assumption that he would become king. The youngest son, Henry, received money. After entrusting England to his second son, the elder William sent the younger William back to England on 7 or 8 September, bearing a letter to Lanfranc ordering the archbishop to aid the new king. Other bequests included gifts to the Church and money to be distributed to the poor. William also ordered that all of his prisoners be released, including his half-brother Odo.\nDisorder followed William's death; everyone who had been at his deathbed left the body at Rouen and hurried off to attend to their own affairs. Eventually, the clergy of Rouen arranged to have the body sent to Caen, where William had desired to be buried in his foundation of the Abbaye-aux-Hommes. The funeral, attended by the bishops and abbots of Normandy as well as his son Henry, was disturbed by a citizen of Caen who alleged that his family had been illegally despoiled of the land on which the church was built. After hurried consultations, the allegation was shown to be true, and the man was compensated. A further indignity occurred when the corpse was lowered into the tomb. The corpse was too large for the space, and when attendants forced the body into the tomb it burst, spreading a disgusting odour throughout the church.\nWilliam's grave is marked by a marble slab with a Latin inscription dating from the early 19th century. The tomb has been disturbed several times since 1087, the first time in 1522 when the grave was opened on orders from the papacy. The intact body was restored to the tomb at that time, but in 1562, during the French Wars of Religion, the grave was reopened and the bones scattered and lost, with the exception of one thigh bone. This lone relic was reburied in 1642 with a new marker, which was replaced 100 years later with a more elaborate monument. This tomb was again destroyed during the French Revolution but was eventually replaced with the current ledger stone.\nLegacy.\nThe immediate consequence of William's death was a war between his sons Robert and William over control of England and Normandy. Even after the younger William's death in 1100 and the succession of his youngest brother Henry as king, Normandy and England remained contested between the brothers until Robert's capture by Henry at the Battle of Tinchebray in 1106. The difficulties over the succession led to a loss of authority in Normandy, with the aristocracy regaining much of the power they had lost to the elder William. His sons also lost much of their control over Maine, which revolted in 1089 and managed to remain mostly free of Norman influence thereafter.\nThe impact on England of William's conquest was profound; changes in the Church, aristocracy, culture, and language of the country have persisted into modern times. The Conquest brought the kingdom into closer contact with France and forged ties that lasted throughout the Middle Ages. Another consequence of William's invasion was the sundering of the formerly close ties between England and Scandinavia. William's government blended elements of the English and Norman systems into a new one that laid the foundations of the later medieval English kingdom. How abrupt and far-reaching the changes were is still a matter of debate among historians, with some such as Richard Southern claiming that the Conquest was the single most radical change in European history between the Fall of Rome and the 20th century. Others, such as H. G. Richardson and G. O. Sayles, see the changes as much less radical. The historian Eleanor Searle describes William's invasion as \"a plan that no ruler but a Scandinavian would have considered\".\nWilliam's reign has caused historical controversy since before his death. William of Poitiers wrote glowingly of William's reign and its benefits, but the obituary notice for William in the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" condemns William in harsh terms. During the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, Archbishop Matthew Parker saw the Conquest as having corrupted a purer English Church, which Parker attempted to restore. During the 17th and 18th centuries, some historians and lawyers saw William's reign as imposing a \"Norman yoke\" on the native Anglo-Saxons, an argument that continued during the 19th century with further elaborations along nationalistic lines. These controversies have led to William being seen by some historians either as one of the creators of England's greatness or as inflicting one of the greatest defeats in English history. Others have viewed him as an enemy of the English constitution, or alternatively as its creator.\nFamily and children.\nWilliam and his wife Matilda had at least nine children. The birth order of the sons is clear, but no source gives the relative order of birth of the daughters.\nThere is no evidence of any illegitimate children born to William.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was less successful in extending his control into Wales. The third son of William the Conqueror, he is commonly referred to as William Rufus (\"\" being Latin for \"the Red\"), perhaps because of his ruddy appearance or, more likely, because he had red hair.\nWilliam was a figure of complex temperament, capable of both bellicosity and flamboyance. He did not marry or have children, which \u2014 along with contemporary accounts \u2014 has led some historians to speculate on his sexuality. He died after being hit by an arrow while hunting. Circumstantial evidence in the behaviour of those around him \u2013 including his younger brother Henry I \u2013 raises strong but unproven suspicions of murder. Upon William's death, Henry immediately seized the treasury and had himself crowned king.\nHistorian Frank Barlow writes that William was a \"rumbustious, devil-may-care soldier, without natural dignity or social graces, with no cultivated tastes and little show of conventional religious piety or morality \u2013 indeed, according to his critics, addicted to every kind of vice, particularly lust and especially sodomy.\" On the other hand, he was a wise ruler and victorious general, Barlow writes: \"His chivalrous virtues and achievements were all too obvious. He had maintained good order and satisfactory justice in England and restored good peace to Normandy. He had extended Anglo-Norman rule in Wales, brought Scotland firmly under his lordship, recovered Maine, and kept up the pressure on the Vexin.\"\nEarly years.\nWilliam's date of birth is not known, but according to historian Frank Barlow it occurred by 1060. He was the third of four sons born to William the Conqueror and Matilda of Flanders, the eldest being Robert Curthose, the second Richard, and the youngest Henry. Richard died around 1075 while hunting in the New Forest. William succeeded to the throne of England on his father's death in 1087, but Robert inherited Normandy.\nWilliam had five or six sisters. The existence of sisters Adeliza and Matilda is not absolutely certain, but four sisters are more securely attested:\nRecords indicate strained relations between the three surviving sons of William I. William's contemporary, chronicler Orderic Vitalis, wrote about an incident that took place at L'Aigle in Normandy in 1077 or 1078: William and Henry, having grown bored with casting dice, decided to make mischief by emptying a chamber pot onto their brother Robert from an upper gallery, thus infuriating and shaming him. A brawl broke out, and their father had to intercede to restore order.\nAccording to William of Malmesbury, writing in the 12th century, William Rufus was \"well set; his complexion florid, his hair yellow; of open countenance; different coloured eyes, varying with certain glittering specks; of astonishing strength, though not very tall, and his belly rather projecting.\"\nReign.\nEngland and France.\nThe division of William the Conqueror's lands into two parts upon his death presented a dilemma for those nobles who held land on both sides of the English Channel. Since the younger William and his brother Robert were natural rivals, these nobles worried that they could not hope to please both of their lords and thus ran the risk of losing the favour of one ruler or the other, or both. The solution, as they saw it, was to unite England and Normandy once more under one ruler. The pursuit of this aim led them to revolt against William in favour of Robert in the Rebellion of 1088, under the leadership of the powerful Bishop Odo of Bayeux, who was a half-brother of William the Conqueror. As Robert failed to appear in England to rally his supporters, William won the support of the English with silver and promises of better government, and defeated the rebellion, thus securing his authority. In 1090, William decided to intervene in Normandy and started buying the allegiance of Norman barons in Upper Normandy, but his attempt to plot to take the city of Rouen in November that year failed. In 1091 he invaded Normandy, crushing Robert's forces and forcing him to cede a portion of his lands. The two made up their differences, and William agreed to help Robert recover lands lost to France, notably Maine. This plan was later abandoned, but William continued to pursue a ferociously warlike defence of his French possessions and interests to the end of his life, exemplified by his response to the attempt by Elias de la Fl\u00e8che, Count of Maine, to take Le Mans in 1099.\nWilliam Rufus was thus secure in his kingdom. As in Normandy, his bishops and abbots were bound to him by feudal obligations, and his right of investiture in the Norman tradition prevailed within his kingdom during the age of the Investiture Controversy that brought excommunication upon the Salian Emperor Henry IV. The king's personal power, through an effective and loyal chancery, penetrated to the local level to an extent unmatched in France. The king's administration and law unified the realm, rendering him relatively impervious to papal condemnation. In 1097 he commenced the original Westminster Hall, built \"to impress his subjects with the power and majesty of his authority\".\nReligion.\nLess than two years after becoming king, William II lost his father's adviser and confidant, the Italian-Norman Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury who died in 1089. The king delayed appointing a new archbishop for many years, appropriating ecclesiastical revenues in the interim. In panic, owing to serious illness in 1093, William nominated as archbishop another Norman-Italian, Anselm\u00a0\u2013 considered the greatest theologian of his generation \u2013 but this led to a long period of animosity between Church and State, Anselm being a stronger supporter of the Gregorian reforms in the Church than Lanfranc. William and Anselm disagreed on a range of ecclesiastical issues, in the course of which the king declared of Anselm, \"Yesterday I hated him with great hatred, today I hate him with yet greater hatred and he can be certain that tomorrow and thereafter I shall hate him continually with ever fiercer and more bitter hatred.\"\nThe English clergy, beholden to the king for their preferments and livings, were unable to support Anselm publicly. In 1095 William called a council at Rockingham to bring Anselm to heel, but the archbishop remained firm. In October 1097, Anselm went into exile, taking his case to the pope. The diplomatic and flexible Urban II, a new pope, was involved in a major conflict with Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV, who supported Antipope Clement III. Reluctant to make another enemy, Urban came to a concordat with William, whereby William recognised Urban as pope, and Urban gave sanction to the Anglo-Norman ecclesiastical \"status quo\". Anselm remained in exile, and William was able to claim the revenues of the archbishop of Canterbury to the end of his reign.\nHowever, this conflict was symptomatic of medieval English politics, as exemplified by the murder of Thomas Becket during the reign of the later Plantagenet King Henry II (his great-nephew through his brother Henry) and Henry VIII's actions centuries later, and as such should not be seen as a defect of William's reign in particular. Of course, contemporary churchmen were not above engaging in such politics: it is reported that when Archbishop Lanfranc suggested to William I that he imprison the rebellious Bishop Odo of Bayeux, he exclaimed \"What! He is a clergyman.\" Lanfranc retorted \"You will not seize the bishop of Bayeux, but confine the earl of Kent.\" (Odo held both titles.)\nWhile there are complaints of contemporaries regarding William's personal behaviour, he was instrumental in assisting the foundation of Bermondsey Abbey, endowing it with the manor of Bermondsey, and it is reported that his \"customary oath\" was \"By the Face at Lucca!\"\nWar and rebellion.\nWilliam Rufus inherited the Anglo-Norman settlement detailed in the Domesday Book of 1086, a survey undertaken at his father's command, essentially for the purposes of taxation, which was an example of the control of the English monarchy. If he was less effective than his father in containing the Norman lords' propensity for rebellion and violence, through charisma or political skills, he was forceful in overcoming the consequences. In 1095, Robert de Mowbray, the earl of Northumbria, refused to attend the \"Curia Regis\", the thrice-annual court where the King announced his governmental decisions to the great lords. William led an army against Robert and defeated him. Robert was dispossessed and imprisoned, and another noble, William of Eu, accused of treachery, was blinded and castrated.\nIn external affairs, William had some successes. In 1091 he repulsed an invasion by King Malcolm III of Scotland, forcing Malcolm to pay homage. In 1092 he built Carlisle Castle, taking control of Cumberland and Westmorland, which had previously been claimed by the Scots. Subsequently, the two kings quarrelled over Malcolm's possessions in England, and Malcolm again invaded, ravaging Northumbria. At the Battle of Alnwick, on 13 November 1093, Malcolm was ambushed by Norman forces led by Robert de Mowbray. Malcolm and his son Edward were killed, and Malcolm's brother Donald seized the Scottish throne. William supported Malcolm's son Duncan II, who held power for a short time, and then another of Malcolm's sons, Edgar. Edgar conquered Lothian in 1094 and removed Donald in 1097 with William's aid in a campaign led by Edgar \u00c6theling. Edgar recognised William's authority over Lothian and attended William's court. William made two forays into Wales in 1097. Nothing decisive was achieved, but a series of castles were constructed as a marchland defensive barrier.\nIn 1096 Robert Curthose joined the First Crusade. He needed money to fund this venture and pledged his lands in Normandy to William in return for a payment of 10,000 marks, which equates to about a quarter of William's annual revenue. In a display of the effectiveness of English taxation, William raised the money by levying a special, heavy, and much-resented tax upon the whole of England. He then ruled Normandy as regent in Robert's absence. Robert returned in September 1100, one month after William's death. As regent in Normandy, William campaigned in France from 1097 to 1099. He secured northern Maine but failed to seize the French-controlled part of the Vexin region. According to chronicler William of Malmesbury he was planning to invade the Duchy of Aquitaine at the time of his death.\nDeath.\nWilliam went hunting on 2 August 1100 in the New Forest, probably near Brockenhurst, and was killed by an arrow through the lung, although the circumstances remain unclear. The earliest statement of the event was in the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", which notes that the king was \"shot by an arrow by one of his own men.\" Later chroniclers add the name of the killer, a nobleman named Walter Tirel, although the description of events was later embroidered with other details that may or may not be true. The first mention of any location more exact than the New Forest comes from John Leland, who wrote in 1530 that William died at Thorougham, a placename that is no longer used but that probably referred to a location on what is now Park Farm on the Beaulieu estates. A memorial stone in the grounds of Beaulieu Abbey, Hampshire, states \"Remember King William Rufus who died in these parts then known as Truham whilst hunting on 2nd August 1100\".\nThe king's body was abandoned by the nobles at the place where he fell. An arrow maker, Eli Parratt, later found the body. William's younger brother Henry hastened to Winchester to secure the royal treasury (initially defended by the Norman William of Breteuil in deference to the claims of Duke Robert), then to London, where he was crowned within days before either archbishop could arrive. William of Malmesbury states that the body was taken to Winchester Cathedral by a few countrymen, including Eli who discovered the body.\nTo the chroniclers, men of the Church, such an \"act of God\" was a just end for a wicked king and was regarded as a fitting demise for a ruler who came into conflict with the religious orders to which they belonged. Over the following centuries, the obvious suggestion that one of William's enemies had a hand in this event has repeatedly been made: chroniclers of the time point out that Tirel was renowned as a keen bowman and thus was unlikely to have loosed such an impetuous shot. Moreover, Bartlett says that rivalry between brothers was the pattern of political conflict in this period. Henry was among the hunting party that day and succeeded him as king.\nModern scholars have reopened the question, and some have found the assassination theory credible or compelling, but the theory is not universally accepted. Barlow says that accidents were common and there is not enough hard evidence to prove murder. Bartlett notes that hunting was dangerous. Poole says the facts \"look ugly\" and \"seem to suggest a plot.\" John Gillingham points out that if Henry had planned to murder William it would have been in his interest to wait until a later time. It looked as though there would soon be a war between William and Robert, which would result in one of them being eliminated, thus opening the way for Henry to acquire both England and Normandy through a single assassination. Tirel fled immediately. Henry had the most to gain by William's death. Indeed, Henry's actions \"seem to be premeditated: wholly disregarding his dead brother, he rode straight for Winchester, seized the treasury (always the first act of a usurping king), and the next day had himself elected.\"\nWilliam's remains are in Winchester Cathedral. The tomb long thought to be his is now thought to belong to William's nephew, Henry of Blois. Presently, his remains are scattered among royal mortuary chests positioned on the presbytery screen, flanking the choir. His skull appears to be missing, but some long bones may remain.\nRufus Stone.\nA stone known as the \"Rufus Stone\", close to the A31 near Minstead (grid reference ), is claimed to mark the spot where William fell. The claim that this is the location of his death appears to date from no earlier than a 17th century visit by Charles II to the forest. At the time the most popular account of William's death involved the fatal arrow deflecting off a tree, and Charles appears to have been shown a suitable tree. Letters in \"The Gentleman's Magazine\" report that the tree was cut down and burned during the 18th century. Later in that century the Rufus Stone was set up. Originally it was around tall with a stone ball on top. King George III visited the stone in 1789, along with Queen Charlotte, and an inscription was added to the stone to commemorate the visit. It was protected with a cast iron cover in 1841 after repeated vandalism.\nThe inscription on the Rufus Stone reads:\nHere stood the Oak Tree, on which an arrow shot by Sir Walter Tyrrell at a Stag, glanced and struck King William the Second, surnamed Rufus, on the breast, of which he instantly died, on the second day of August, anno 1100.\nThat the spot where an Event so Memorable might not hereafter be forgotten; the enclosed stone was set up by John Lord Delaware who had seen the Tree growing in this place. This Stone having been much mutilated, and the inscriptions on each of its three sides defaced, this more Durable Memorial, with the original inscriptions, was erected in the year 1841, by Wm [William] Sturges Bourne Warden.\nKing William the Second, surnamed Rufus being slain, as before related, was laid in a cart, belonging to one Purkis, and drawn from hence, to Winchester, and buried in the Cathedral Church, of that City.\nLegacy.\nWilliam was an effective soldier, but he was a ruthless ruler and, it seems, was little liked by those he governed. According to the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", he was \"hated by almost all his people and abhorrent to God.\" Chroniclers tended to take a dim view of William's reign, arguably on account of his long and difficult struggles with the Church: these chroniclers were generally clerics, so might be expected to report him somewhat negatively. His chief minister was Ranulf Flambard, whom he appointed Bishop of Durham in 1099: this was a political appointment, to a see that was also a great fiefdom. The particulars of the king's relationship with the people of England are not credibly documented. Contemporaries of William, as well as those writing after his death, roundly denounced him for presiding over what these dissenters considered a dissolute court. In keeping with the tradition of Norman leaders, William scorned the English and the English culture.\nSexuality.\nWilliam never took a wife or a mistress, nor fathered any children. As a bachelor king without an heir, William would have been pressed to take a wife and would have had numerous proposals for marriage. Several alternative explanations for this have emerged. He may have taken a vow of chastity or celibacy. He may have used the promise of potential marriage as a lever to make alliances. He may not have wanted a powerful woman in his court: his father was regularly at odds with his mother. Some have suggested that William may have been homosexual, although this would appear to be at odds with chroniclers who state that William took female lovers, and the fact that monarchs who were rumored to have taken same-sex lovers, like Edward II, were known to marry for political reasons.\nContemporaries of William raised concerns about a court dominated by homosexuality and effeminacy, epitomised more through seemingly \"luxurious\" attire and unusual footwear than with sexual practices. Citing the traditions of Wilton Abbey in the 1140s, Herman of Tournai writes that the abbess had ordered the Scottish princess Edith (later Matilda, wife of Henry) to become a nun in order to protect her from the lust of William, which angered Edith's father because of the effect it might have on her prospects of marriage. The historian Emma Mason has noted that while during his reign William was never openly accused of homosexuality, in the decades after his death numerous medieval writers spoke of this and a few began to describe him as a \"sodomite\". Modern historians cannot state with certainty whether William was homosexual.\nBarlow states that the Welsh chronicles claim that Henry was able to succeed to the throne because his brother had made use of concubines and thus died childless, although no illegitimate offspring are named. Barlow also allows that William may have been sterile. Noting that no \"favourites\" were identified, and that William's \"baronial friends and companions were mostly married men\", despite having concluded that the chroniclers were \"hostile and biased witnesses\", Barlow considers that \"there seems no reason why they should have invented this particular charge\" (of homosexuality) and states \"On the whole the evidence points to the king's bisexuality\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They compete in the EFL Championship, the second level of the English football league. The club was formed in 1878 and has played at its home ground, The Hawthorns, since 1900.\nAlbion were a founder member of the Football League in 1888, the first professional football league in the world. The club has spent the majority of its existence in the top tier of English football, where it has played for 82 seasons, most recently competing in the Premier League in 2021. They have been champions of England once, in 1919\u201320, and have been runner-up twice, in 1924\u201325 and 1953\u201354. Albion have reached ten FA Cup finals and won the Cup on five occasions. The first win came in 1888, the year the league was founded, followed by wins in 1892, 1931, 1954 and most recently in 1968, the club's last major trophy. Albion also won the Football League Cup at the first attempt in 1966, and have reached a further two finals. The club's longest continuous period in the top division spanned 24 years between 1949 and 1973, and from 1986 to 2002 it had its longest spell out of the top division.\nThe team have played in navy blue and white stripes for most of the club's history, and the club badge features a throstle perched on a hawthorn branch. Albion have long-standing rivalries with their traditional Aston Villa and Wolverhampton Wanderers. Albion contest the Black Country derby with the latter.\nHistory.\nEarly years (1878\u20131950).\nThe club was founded as West Bromwich Strollers in 1878 by workers from George Salter's Spring Works in West Bromwich, in the Black Country.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[A] They were renamed West Bromwich Albion in 1880, becoming the first team to adopt the \"Albion\" suffix; Albion was a district of West Bromwich where some of the players lived or worked, close to what is today Greets Green. The club joined the Birmingham &amp; District Football Association in 1881 and became eligible for their first competition, the Birmingham Cup. They reached the quarter-finals, beating several longer-established clubs on the way. In 1883, Albion won their first trophy, the Staffordshire Cup. Albion joined the Football Association in the same year; this enabled them to enter the FA Cup for the first time in the 1883\u201384 season. In 1885 the club turned professional, and in 1886 the team reached the FA Cup final for the first time, losing 2\u20130 to Blackburn Rovers in a replay. They reached the final again in 1887, but lost 2\u20130 to Aston Villa. In 1888 the team won the trophy for the first time, beating strong favourites Preston North End 2\u20131 in the final. As FA Cup winners, they qualified to play in a Football World Championship game against Scottish Cup winners Renton, which ended in a 4\u20131 defeat.\nIn March 1888, William McGregor wrote to what he considered to be the top five English teams, including Albion, informing them of his intention to form an association of clubs that would play each other home and away each season. Thus when the Football League started later that year, Albion became one of the twelve founder members. Albion's second FA Cup success came in 1892, beating Aston Villa 3\u20130. They met Villa again in the 1895 final, but lost 1\u20130. The team suffered relegation to Division Two in 1900\u201301, their first season at The Hawthorns. They were promoted as champions the following season but relegated again in 1903\u201304. The club won the Division Two championship once more in 1910\u201311, and the following season reached another FA Cup Final, where they were defeated by Second Division Barnsley in a replay.\nAlbion won the Football League title in 1919\u201320 for the only time in their history following the end of World War I, their totals of 104 goals and 60 points both breaking the previous league records. The team finished as Division One runners-up in 1924\u201325, narrowly losing out to Huddersfield Town, but were relegated in 1926\u201327. In 1930\u201331, they won promotion as well as the FA Cup, beating Birmingham 2\u20131 in the final. The \"double\" of winning the FA Cup and promotion has not been achieved before or since. Albion reached the final again in 1935, losing to Sheffield Wednesday, but were relegated three years later. They gained promotion in 1948\u201349, and there followed the club's longest unbroken spell in the top flight of English football, a total of 24 years.\nSuccess and decline (1950\u20131992).\nIn 1953\u201354, Albion came close to being the first team in the 20th century to win the League and Cup double. They succeeded in winning the FA Cup, beating Preston North End 3\u20132, but injuries and a loss of form towards the end of the season meant that they finished as runners-up to fierce rivals Wolverhampton Wanderers in the league. Nonetheless, Albion became known for their brand of fluent, attacking football, with the 1953\u201354 side being hailed as the \"Team of the Century\". One national newspaper went so far as to suggest that the team be chosen \"en masse\" to represent England at the 1954 FIFA World Cup finals. They remained one of the top English sides for the remainder of the decade, reaching the semi-final of the 1957 FA Cup and achieving three consecutive top five finishes in Division One between 1957\u201358 and 1959\u201360.\nAlthough their league form was less impressive during the 1960s, the second half of the decade saw West Brom establish a reputation as a successful cup side. Albion entered the Football League Cup for the first time in 1965\u201366 and, under manager Jimmy Hagan, won the final by defeating West Ham United 5\u20133 on aggregate. That was the last two-legged final and, the following year, Albion reached the final again, the first played at Wembley. They lost 3\u20132 to Third Division Queens Park Rangers after being 2\u20130 up at half-time. Albion's cup form continued under Hagan's successor Alan Ashman. He guided the club to their last major trophy to date, the 1968 FA Cup, when they beat Everton in extra time thanks to a single goal from Jeff Astle. Albion reached the FA Cup semi-final and European Cup Winners Cup quarter-final in 1969, and were defeated 2\u20131 by Manchester City in the 1970 League Cup Final. \nThe club were less successful during the reign of Don Howe, and were relegated to Division Two at the end of 1972\u201373, but gained promotion three years later under the guidance of player-manager Johnny Giles. Under Ron Atkinson, Albion reached the 1978 FA Cup semi-final but lost to Ipswich Town. In May of that year, Albion became the first English professional team to play in China, going unbeaten on their five-game trip. In 1978\u201379, the team finished third in Division One, their highest placing for over 20 years, and also reached the UEFA Cup quarter-final, where they were defeated by Red Star Belgrade. The team around this time was notable for simultaneously fielding three black players: Cyrille Regis, Laurie Cunningham and Brendon Batson; and is considered to be an integral part of the acceptance of black footballers in the English leagues. In his second spell as manager, Ronnie Allen guided the team to both domestic cup semi-finals in 1981\u201382. The mid-1980s saw the start of Albion's longest and deepest decline. They were relegated in 1985\u201386 with the worst record in the club's history, beginning a period of 16 years outside the top flight. Five years later, the club were relegated to the Third Division for the first and only time.\nRecent years (1992\u2013present).\nAlbion had spent the majority of their history in the top-flight of English football, but when the Premier League was founded in 1992 the club found themselves in the third tier, which had been renamed Division Two. In 1992\u201393, Albion finished fourth and entered the play-offs for the first time. Albion's first appearance at Wembley for over 20 years \u2013 and their last at the original stadium \u2013 saw them beat Port Vale 3\u20130 to return to the second level \u2013 now renamed the First Division. Manager Ossie Ardiles then joined Tottenham Hotspur, however, and a succession of managers over the next few seasons saw Albion consolidate their Division One status without mounting a serious promotion challenge.\nThe appointment of Gary Megson in March 2000 heralded an upturn in the club's fortunes. Megson guided Albion to Division One safety in 1999\u20132000, and to the play-offs a year later. He went on to lead the club to promotion to the Premier League in 2001\u201302. After being relegated in their first Premier League season, they made an immediate return to the top flight in 2003\u201304. In 2004\u201305, Megson's successor, former Albion midfielder Bryan Robson, led the team to a last-day \"Great Escape\", when Albion became the first Premier League club to avoid relegation having been bottom of the table at Christmas, as well as bottom on the final day of the season.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[G] They failed to avoid the drop the following season, and Robson was replaced by Tony Mowbray in October 2006. The club competed in the Championship play-off final at Wembley Stadium on 28 May 2007, but lost 1\u20130 to Derby County. The following season, Mowbray led the Baggies to Wembley again, this time in the semi-finals of the FA Cup, where they lost 1\u20130 to Portsmouth. One month later, Albion were promoted to the Premier League as winners of the Championship, but were relegated at the end of the 2008\u201309 campaign. Mowbray left the club and was replaced by Roberto Di Matteo, who led the club back to the Premier League at the first attempt, but was dismissed in February 2011 and replaced by Roy Hodgson.\nHodgson guided Albion to an 11th-place finish for the 2010\u201311 season. Then followed an eight-season continuous run in the Premier League. It included an 8th-place finish in 2012\u201313 under Steve Clarke, and 10th-place finishes under Roy Hodgson in 2011\u201312 and Tony Pulis in 2016\u201317. In August 2016, it was announced that long-term owner Jeremy Peace had sold the club to a Chinese investment group headed up by Lai Guochuan. By this time, the club had begun to fall into a state of torpor, and were relegated at the end of the 2017\u201318 season, ending their eight-year Premier League stay. Pulis and his replacement Alan Pardew were both dismissed during the season. Albion finished fourth in their first season back in the Championship under the management of Darren Moore, losing the Championship play-off semi-final on penalties. \nSlaven Bili\u0107 took over as manager in June 2019, and led Albion to automatic promotion back to the Premier League during the 2019\u201320 season. Back in the Premier League, Bili\u0107 was controversially sacked on 16 December 2020, with Sam Allardyce named as his replacement the same day. After Albion were relegated from the Premier League at the end of the 2020\u201321 season, Allardyce resigned from his position. The club endured disappointing results back in the Championship during the tenures of Val\u00e9rien Isma\u00ebl and Steve Bruce, who left the club in the relegation places in the 2022\u201323 season. Carlos Corber\u00e1n was named as successor on 25 October 2022. He guided Albion to a 5th-place finish and the play-off semi-finals at the end of the 2023\u201324 season.\nCrest and colours.\nBadge.\nAlbion's main club badge dates back to the late 1880s, when club secretary Tom Smith suggested that a throstle (song thrush) sitting on a crossbar be adopted for the badge.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[B] The badge has been subject to various revisions since then. It has always featured a throstle, usually on a blue and white striped shield, although the crossbar was replaced with a hawthorn branch at some point after the club's move to the Hawthorns. The throstle was chosen because the public house in which the team used to change kept a pet thrush in a cage. It also gave rise to Albion's early nickname, \"the Throstles\". The hawthorn bush is also a favourite bush of throstles, which were regularly seen on the pre-stadium estate and local area. As late as the 1930s, a caged throstle was placed beside the touchline during matches and it was said that it only used to sing if Albion were winning. In 1979, an effigy of a throstle was erected above the half-time scoreboard of the Woodman corner at the Hawthorns, and was returned to the same area of the ground following redevelopment in the early 2000s.\nIn 1975, a version of the badge (on a roundel rather than a shield) was granted by the College of Arms to the Football League for licensing to the club. The badge was described in heraldic blazon as, \"On a roundel paly of thirteen argent and azure a mistle thrush perched on a raspberry branch leaved and fructed proper.\" This is the only known occasion on which the branch has been described as a raspberry branch rather than a hawthorn branch: Rodney Dennys, the officer of arms responsible, may have been imperfectly briefed.\nThe badge was re-designed in 2006, incorporating the name of the club for the first time. The new design aimed to safeguard and consolidate the club's identity. Prior to this, the main club badge rarely coincided with that worn on the first team strip. No badge appeared on the kit for most of the club's history, although the Stafford knot featured on the team jerseys for part of the 1880s. The West Bromwich town arms were worn on the players' shirts for the 1931, 1935 and 1954 FA Cup finals. The town's Latin motto, \"Labor omnia vincit\", translates as \"labour conquers all things\" or \"work conquers all\". The town arms were revived as the shirt badge from 1994 until 2000,&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[C] with the throstle moved to the collar of the shirts.\nAlbion's first regular shirt badge appeared in the late 1960s and early 1970s where it was blue. Although it featured the throstle, it did not include the blue and white striped shield of the club badge. A similar design was also used during the late 1980s and early 1990s. In the mid-1970s, a more abstract version of the throstle was used on the club's shirts, while in the late 1970s through to the mid-1980s, an embroidered WBA logo was displayed, a common abbreviation of the club's name in print. Not until the early 21st century did the full club badge appear on the team's shirts.\nColours.\n \n Albion's strip from 1882 to 1883 was one of many variations worn during the 1880s. Note that the actual kit had long sleeves.\n Albion's most common away colours during the late 20th and early 21st century.\nWest Brom have played in navy blue and white striped shirts for the majority of their existence, usually with white shorts and white socks. The team is occasionally referred to as \"the Stripes\" by supporters. A number of different colours were trialled during the club's formative years however, including cardinal red and blue quarters in 1880\u201381, yellow and white quarters in 1881\u201382, chocolate and blue halves in 1881\u201382 and 1882\u201383, red and white hoops in 1882\u201383, chocolate and white in 1883\u201384 and cardinal red and blue halves in 1884\u201385. The blue and white stripes made their first appearance in the 1885\u201386 season, although at that time they were of a lighter shade of blue; the navy blue stripes did not appear until after the First World War. For the regional leagues played during the Second World War, Albion were forced to switch to all-blue shirts, as rationing meant that striped material was considered a luxury.\nLike all football clubs, Albion sport a secondary or \"change\" strip when playing away from home against a team whose colours clash with their own. As long ago as the 1890s, and throughout much of the club's early history, a change strip of white jerseys with black shorts was worn. The away shirt additionally featured a large 'V' during the First World War. In the 1935 FA Cup Final, however, when both of Albion and Sheffield Wednesday's kits clashed, a switch was made to plain navy blue shirts. An all-red strip was adopted at the end of the 1950s, but was dropped following defeat in the 1967 League Cup Final, to be replaced by the all-white design that was worn during the club's FA Cup run of 1967\u201368. Since then the away strip has changed regularly, with yellow and green stripes the most common of a number of different designs used. In the 1990s and 2000s a third kit has occasionally been introduced.\nAlbion players \u2013 along with those of other Football League teams \u2013 first wore numbers on the back of their shirts in the abandoned season of 1939\u201340, and names on the back of their shirts from 1999\u20132000. Red numbers were added to the side of Albion players' shorts in 1969.\nKit Sponsors.\nBSR Housewares became the club's first shirt sponsor during the 1981\u201382 season. The club's shirts have been sponsored for the majority of the time since then, although there was no shirt sponsor at the end of the 1993\u201394 season, after local solicitors Coucher &amp; Shaw were closed down by the Law Society of England and Wales. Unusually for a Premier League club, Albion were again without a shirt sponsor for the start of the 2008\u201309 campaign, as negotiations with a new sponsor were still ongoing when the season began. The longest-running shirt sponsorship deal agreed by the club ran for seven seasons between 1997 and 2004 with the West Bromwich Building Society. Today the club's principal sponsor is Ideal Heating.\nSince June 2024, West Brom's kit has been manufactured by Macron. Previous manufacturers have included Scoreline, Influence, Pelada, Patrick, Diadora, Umbro, Adidas and Puma.\nStadium.\nThe speed with which the club became established following its foundation is illustrated by the fact that it outgrew four successive grounds in its first seven years. The first was Cooper's Hill, where they played from 1878 to 1879. From 1879 to 1881, they appear to have alternated between Cooper's Hill and Dartmouth Park. During the 1881\u201382 season, they played at Bunn's Field, also known as the Birches. This had a capacity of between 1,500 and 2,000, and was Albion's first enclosed ground, allowing the club to charge an entrance fee for the first time. From 1882 to 1885, as the popularity of football increased, Albion rented the Four Acres ground from the well-established West Bromwich Dartmouth Cricket Club. But they quickly outgrew this new home and soon needed to move again. From 1885 to 1900, Albion played at Stoney Lane; their tenure of this ground was arguably the most successful period in the club's history, as they won the FA Cup twice and were runners-up three times.\nBy 1900, when the lease on Stoney Lane expired, the club needed a bigger ground yet again and so made its last move to date. All of Albion's previous grounds had been close to the centre of West Bromwich, but on this occasion they took up a site on the town's border with Handsworth and Smethwick. The new ground was named The Hawthorns, after the hawthorn bushes that covered the area and were cleared to make way for it. Albion drew 1\u20131 with Derby County in the first match at the stadium, on 3 September 1900. The record attendance at the Hawthorns was on 6 March 1937, when 64,815 spectators saw Albion beat Arsenal 3\u20131 in the FA Cup quarter-final. The Hawthorns became an all-seater stadium in the 1990s, in order to comply with the recommendations of the Taylor Report. Its capacity today is 26,688, the four stands being known respectively as the Birmingham Road End, Smethwick End, East Stand and West Stand (Halfords Lane). At an altitude of 551\u00a0feet (168\u00a0m) above sea level, the Hawthorns is the highest of all the 92 Premier League and Football League grounds.\nThe Hawthorns is certificated under the highest UEFA pitch surfaces which means it is ready to host almost any competition if required. The stadium's West Stand has the potential to be developed over the Halfords Lane at the back of the stand to allow for an upper tier, bringing the capacity of The Hawthorns to around 30,000.\nWest Bromwich Albion own retail outlets around The Hawthorns, including its Stadium Megastore and seasonally a club store in West Bromwich town centre. They also own the former Hawthorns Pub, a Grade II listed building behind the West Stand on the corner of Halfords Lane and the Birmingham Road. This has served as the official club fanzone with licensed bars, live music, fan favourites \u2013 such as mascots and children activities \u2013 as well as being shared with a high street food outlet. The pub competes with The Vine pub in Roebuck Lane, a popular destination for visiting and home football fans year-round.\nSupporters.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Rquote/styles.css\"/&gt;{ class=\"rquote pullquote floatright\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"display:table; border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; float:right; margin:0.5em 0.75em; width:33%; \"\nFan culture.\nThe official West Bromwich Albion Supporters Club was founded on 4 October 1951. In the years since then, over 30 branches have been established throughout the United Kingdom, and internationally in Jersey, Ireland, Spain, Malta, Croatia, USA, UAE, India, Thailand and Australia. There are also supporters groups for those with disabilities, for mental health support, Punjabi supporters, supporters in the emergency services and armed forces, and LGBT people.\nAlbion's \"club anthem\" is \"The Lord's my Shepherd\", a setting of Psalm 23. The song originated following a rare Sunday game in the 1970s and has been sung at matches ever since. Supporters of the team celebrate goals by bouncing up and down and chanting \"Boing Boing\". This dates back to the 1992\u201393 season, when the team was promoted from the new Second Division, with the origin of the chant still unclear. \"The Liquidator\" instrumental by the Harry J. Allstars has also been popularly played in the stadium and sung to since the late 1960s. The reggae song \"West Bromwich Albion\" by Ray King is another club anthem popularly played before matches. In recent years fans of the team have celebrated the end of each season by adopting a fancy dress theme for the final away match, including dressing as Vikings in 2004 in honour of Player of the Season Thomas Gaards\u00f8e.\nIn 2002\u201303 Albion's fans were voted the best in the Premier League by their peers, while in the BBC's 2002 \"national intelligence test\" \"Test the Nation\", they were found to be \"more likely to be smarter than any other football supporters, registering an average score of 138\".\nFamous fans include goalkeepers Aaron Ramsdale, Hannah Hampton and Ben Foster, comedian Frank Skinner, TV presenters Adrian Chiles, Anne Aston and Cat Deeley, One Direction singer Liam Payne, comedian Lenny Henry, actress Julie Walters, The Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood, tennis players Ann Jones and Goran Ivani\u0161evi\u0107, DJ Dave Haslam, boxers Richie Woodhall and Tommy Langford, and guitarist Eric Clapton.\nPublications.\nThe club has published an official matchday programme for supporters since 1905. The publication was entitled \"Albion News\" for many years, but was renamed \"Albion\" from the 2002\u201303 season until the close season of 2013, when it was renamed back to \"Albion News\". It won Premier League Programme of the Year in 2002\u201303 and Third Division Programme of the Year in 1991\u201392. In 2007\u201308, it was awarded Championship Programme of the Year by both Programme Monthly and the Football Programme Directory. The programme has a circulation in excess of 8,000 copies. The first West Bromwich Albion fanzine, \"Fingerpost\", was published from 1983 until 1992, and was followed by several others, most notably \"Grorty Dick\" (1989\u20132005) and \"Last Train to Rolfe Street\" (1992\u20131995). Since \"Grorty Dick\" ceased publication in 2005, the club now only has one fanzine dedicated to it; 'Baggie Shorts' which is produced by the West Bromwich Albion Supporters' Club London Branch.\n\"Baggies\" nickname.\nAlthough known in their early days as \"the Throstles\", the club's more popular nickname among supporters came to be \"the Baggies\", a term which the club itself looked down upon for many years but later embraced. The phrase was first heard at the Hawthorns in the 1900s, but its exact origins are uncertain. One suggestion is that the name was bestowed on Albion supporters by their rivals at Aston Villa, because of the large baggy trousers that many Albion fans wore at work to protect themselves from molten iron in the factories and foundries of the Black Country. Club historian Tony Matthews, however, suggests that it derives from the \"bagmen\", who carried the club's matchday takings in big leather bags from the turnstiles to the cash office on the halfway line. Other theories relate to the baggy shorts worn by various players during the club's early years. The official club mascots are named \"Baggie Bird\" and \"Albi\"; both are based on the throstle depicted on the club crest.\nRivalries.\nHistorically, Albion's greatest rivals were Aston Villa from nearby Birmingham. The two clubs contested three FA Cup Finals between 1887 and 1895 (Villa winning two and Albion one). More recently, however, most Albion fans tend to see Wolverhampton Wanderers as their main rivals, particularly as between 1989 and 2002 Albion and Villa were never in the same division, but Albion were in the same division as Wolves for 11 out of 14 seasons. This had led to Aston Villa supporters now considering Birmingham City to be their fiercest rivals. A less-heated rivalry also exists with Birmingham City, with whom Albion contested the 1931 FA Cup final, as well as a semi-final in 1968.\nA number of hooligan firms associate themselves with Albion, including Section 5, Clubhouse and the Smethwick Mob.\nBlack Country derby.\nAlbion and Wolves contest the Black Country derby, one of the longest standing derbies in world football. It is considered one of the fiercest rivalries in English football. A 2008 survey found it to be the most intense rivalry in the country, with one in four fans from both clubs claiming that their rivalry went much deeper than football. The two sides have played each other 160 times, with their first major clash being an FA Cup tie in 1886. Both Albion and Wolves were founding members of the Football League in 1888, making the derby the joint oldest in English league football. \nThe rivalry came to prominence when the two clubs contested the league title in 1953\u201354, and during the 1990s it intensified to new heights among supporters, with both clubs languishing in Division One for much of the decade and only local pride at stake. Moreover, in 2002 Albion came from being 11 points adrift to overhaul Wolves to gain promotion. The rivalry was further heightened after the sides met in the play-offs in 2007. A 2004 survey by Planetfootball.com confirmed that the majority of both Albion and Wolves supporters consider the other to be their main rival. In February 2012 the Baggies beat Wolves 5\u20131 away from home, with Peter Odemwingie scoring a hat-trick. The game became known as the 'demolition derby', and remains the highest scoring Black Country derby of the 21st century. Despite their geographical location, fellow Black Country club Walsall are seen as lesser rivals, having played in a lower division than Albion for most of their history.\nRivalry with Aston Villa.\nRanked by \"The Daily Telegraph\" in 2010 as the most fierce in the region, games between Aston Villa and West Brom are particularly ferocious. The two first met on 9 December 1882, in the second round of the Staffordshire Cup: Villa hosted a 3\u20133 draw in front of 13,900 fans, while in the replay West Brom won by a single goal with an attendance of 10,500. On 3 January 1885, they met for the first time in the third round of the FA Cup: a goalless draw at West Brom was followed by a 3\u20130 victory for them away at Villa. The following year, both teams became founder members of the Football League. They met first in a league fixture on 19 January 1889, Villa winning 2\u20130 at home, before a draw the next week ending 3\u20133. The two teams met in two further FA Cup finals in the 19th century, a 3\u20130 win for West Brom in 1892 and a 1\u20130 win for Aston Villa in 1895.\nBirmingham City were relegated from the Premier League in 2011 and Wolverhampton Wanderers a season later, leaving Aston Villa and West Brom as the only West Midlands teams in England's top division. Without their respective main rivals and with Albion finishing above their nearest rivals for the second season in a row, the historic rivalry was rekindled to pre-1990s competitiveness. At the end of the 2015\u201316 season, Aston Villa were relegated, leaving West Brom as the only West Midlands team in the top flight for the 2016\u201317 season. After Albion's relegation at the end of the 2017\u201318 Premier League, the teams faced each other in the Championship. In the 2018\u201319 EFL Championship play-off semi-finals, Villa controversially knocked out Albion on penalties, after the Albion had two men sent-off over both legs.\nOwnership and governance.\n\"As of 1 September 2024\": \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHistory of Albion's ownership and governance.\nIn the club's formative years, West Bromwich Albion were run by a seven-man playing committee, and funded by each member contributing a weekly subscription of 6d (six pence) (2&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442p). Albion's first chairman was Henry Jackson, appointed in 1885, with the club becoming a limited company in June 1891. Other early chairmen of Albion included Jem Bayliss and Billy Bassett, both of whom had earlier played for the club. Indeed, from 1878 to 1986 there was always an Albion player or ex-player on the club's committee or board of directors. Bassett became an Albion director in 1905, following the resignation of the previous board in its entirety. The club was in deep financial trouble and had had a writ served upon them by their bank, but Bassett and returning chairman Harry Keys rescued the club, aided by local fund-raising activities. Bassett became chairman in 1908, and helped the club to avoid bankruptcy once more in 1910 by paying the players' summer wages from his own pocket. He remains Albion's longest-serving chairman, having held the position until his death in 1937. The club's longest-serving director was Major H. Wilson Keys, during the period 1930\u20131965, including 15 years as chairman. He became vice-president of the Football Association in 1969. Sir Bert Millichip served as Albion chairman from 1974 to 1983, after which he chose to concentrate on his role as chairman of the Football Association. \nIn 1996, the club became a public limited company, issuing shares to supporters at \u00a3500 and \u00a33,000 each, under the Chairmanship of Paul Thompson. The shares were quoted on the Alternative Investment Market, but the club withdrew from the stock exchange in order to become a private company again in 2004. The name of the company thus reverted from West Bromwich Albion plc to West Bromwich Albion Limited, the latter becoming a subsidiary of West Bromwich Albion Holdings Limited. Jeremy Peace took up the post in 2002, after a rift between previous chairman Paul Thompson and manager Gary Megson forced Thompson to quit the club.\nIn September 2007, Peace acquired additional shares in West Bromwich Albion Holdings Limited, taking his total stake in the company to 50.56%. This triggered a requirement, under the Takeover Code, for him to make a mandatory cash offer for the remaining shares in both WBA Holdings Ltd and WBA Ltd. Later that year, Michelle Davies became Albion's first female director. She stepped down in 2010. Jeremy Peace announced in June 2008 that he was looking for a major new investor for the club, but no firm proposals were received by the 31 July deadline. On 24 July 2015, Jeremy Peace announced that his sale exclusivity deal was called off after a potential buyer was unable to fulfil the terms of sale.\nIn July 2016, Peace announced that he had found a buyer in the form of a Chinese investment group headed by Lai Guochuan. The figure agreed upon is believed to have been in the region of \u00a3175\u00a0million \u2013 \u00a3200\u00a0million. The takeover was successfully completed on 15 September the same year. John Williams was originally appointed Chairman of the club before Lai replaced him with associate Li Piyue after the club's relegation in the 2017\u201318 season. Lai himself took over as Chairman on 2 February 2022. The 2022\u201323 season saw increased scrutiny of the club's ownership, and the practices of majority shareholder Guochuan Lai. The club's financial situation began to receive national media attention, having already been commented on frequently in local press. Supporter action groups and in-stadium protests by fans to raise awareness of the club's off-field issues took shape during the season, but were briefly paused in April 2023 as the club's fans supported the side's promotion push.\nOn 15 February 2024, it was announced that Florida-based entrepreneur Shilen Patel and his father, philanthropist Kiran C Patel had reached an agreement to acquire an 87.8% stake in the club, under the name Bilkul Football WBA. Shilen Patel would also be named as the Chairman of the club.\n \"As of 4 November 2025\"\nPlayers.\nCurrent squad.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Football squad player/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCoaching staff.\n\"As of 1 September 2025\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotable former players.\nAs part of the club's 125th anniversary celebrations in 2004, a survey was commissioned via the official West Bromwich Albion website and the \"Express &amp; Star\" newspaper to determine the greatest West Brom players of all time. A modern-day, 16-man squad was compiled from the results; all selected players are depicted on a commemorative mural displayed at The Hawthorns. Fourteen of the sixteen players are English-born, with a fifteenth, Cyrille Regis, a French Guiana-born full England international. The list of 16 is as follows:\nOther notable honours bestowed upon West Brom players include the PFA Young Player of the Year award, which was presented to Cyrille Regis in 1979. In 1998, Billy Bassett and Bryan Robson were named among the list of Football League 100 Legends, along with Arthur Rowley, Geoff Hurst and Johnny Giles. Bryan Robson was also an inaugural inductee into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002, to be joined two years later by Geoff Hurst. Bobby Robson, a player with Albion, has also been inducted, although this was for his achievements as a manager. In 1919\u201320, Fred Morris became the first Albion player to finish as top goalscorer in Division One, a feat which has since been repeated by Ronnie Allen, Derek Kevan, Jeff Astle and Tony Brown.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[D] Brown, who holds the club records for goals and appearances, was voted into the PFA Centenary Hall of Fame in July 2007.\nPartial list of managers.\nThe following managers have all led West Bromwich Albion to at least one of the following achievements while in charge of the club: winning a major trophy or reaching the final, achieving a top three league finish in the top flight, winning promotion or reaching the quarter-finals of a major European competition.\nRecords.\nWest Bromwich Albion's record victory was their 12\u20130 league win against Darwen on 4 April 1892. This is still the widest margin of victory for a game in the top-flight of English football, although the record was equalled by Nottingham Forest when they beat Leicester Fosse by the same scoreline in 1909. Albion's biggest FA Cup victory came when they beat Chatham 10\u20131 on 2 March 1889. The club's record league defeat was a 3\u201310 loss against Stoke City on 4 February 1937, while a 0\u20135 defeat to Leeds United on 18 February 1967 represents Albion's heaviest FA Cup loss.\nTony Brown holds a number of Albion's club records. He has made the most appearances overall for the club (720), as well as most appearances in the league (574), FA Cup (54) and in European competition (17). Brown is the club's top scorer in the league (218), the FA Cup (27) and in Europe (8). He is also the club's record scorer overall, with 279 goals. W. G. Richardson scored 328 goals for the club, but this includes 100 during World War II, which are not normally counted towards competitive totals. Richardson holds the club record for most league goals in a single season, scoring 39 times in 1935\u201336.\nAlbion's most capped international player, taking into account only those caps won whilst at the club, is Chris Brunt. He appeared 55 times for Northern Ireland as an Albion player, earning 65 caps in total before retiring from international football in 2017. Jesse Pennington is the club's most capped England international, with 25 caps. The highest transfer fee paid by the club is \u00a315\u00a0million to RB Leipzig for Oliver Burke on 25 August 2017. The record transfer fee received by Albion from another club was for the transfer of Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n to Dalian Yifang in July 2019 for \u00a316.5 million.\nHonours.\nReference:\nLeague\nCup\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nA.\u00a0&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ : Older sources quote the year of formation as 1879, as evidence of a Strollers match from 1878 came to light only as recently as 1993.\nB.\u00a0&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ : \"Throstle\" is a colloquial Black Country name for the song thrush.\nC.\u00a0&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ : The town crest remained on the away strip until 2001.\nD.\u00a0&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ : Kevan was joint-top scorer with Ray Crawford of Ipswich Town.\nE.\u00a0&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ : Secretary-manager.

It began with a Soviet invasion of Finland on 30 November 1939, three months after the outbreak of World War II, and ended three and a half months later with the Moscow Peace Treaty on 13 March 1940. Despite superior military strength, especially in tanks and aircraft, the Soviet Union suffered severe losses and initially made little headway. The League of Nations deemed the attack illegal and expelled the Soviet Union from its organization.\nThe Soviets made several demands, including that Finland cede substantial border territories in exchange for land elsewhere, claiming security reasons \u2014 primarily the protection of Leningrad, from the Finnish border. When Finland refused, the Soviets invaded. Most sources conclude that the Soviet Union had intended to conquer all of Finland, and cite the establishment of the puppet Finnish Communist government and the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact's secret protocols as evidence of this, while other sources argue against the idea of a full Soviet conquest. Finland repelled Soviet attacks for more than two months and inflicted substantial losses on the invaders in temperatures as low as . The battles focused mainly on Taipale along the Karelian Isthmus, on Kollaa in Ladoga Karelia and on Raate Road in Kainuu, but there were also battles in Lapland and North Karelia.\nFollowing the initial setbacks, the Soviets reduced their strategic objectives and put an end to the puppet Finnish communist government in late January 1940, and informed the legitimate Finnish government that they were willing to negotiate peace. After the Soviet military reorganized and adopted different tactics, they renewed their offensive in February 1940 and overcame the Finnish defences on the Karelian Isthmus. This left the Finnish army in the main theatre of war near the breaking point, with a retreat seeming inevitable. Consequently, Finnish commander-in-chief Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim urged a peace deal with the Soviets, while the Finns still retained bargaining power.\nHostilities ceased in March 1940 with the signing of the Moscow Peace Treaty in which Finland ceded 9% of its territory to the Soviet Union. Soviet losses were heavy, and the country's international reputation suffered. Their gains exceeded their pre-war demands, and the Soviets received substantial territories along Lake Ladoga and further north. Finland retained its sovereignty and enhanced its international reputation. The poor performance of the Red Army encouraged German Chancellor Adolf Hitler to believe that an attack on the Soviet Union would be successful and confirmed negative Western opinions of the Soviet military. After 15 months of Interim Peace, in June 1941, Germany commenced Operation Barbarossa, and the Continuation War between Finland and the Soviets began.\nBackground.\nFinnish-Soviet relations and politics.\nUntil the early nineteenth century, Finland was the eastern part of the Kingdom of Sweden. From 21 February 1808 to 17 September 1809, the Russian Empire waged the Finnish War against the Kingdom of Sweden, ostensibly to protect the Russian capital, Saint Petersburg. Eventually Russia conquered and annexed Finland, and converted it into an autonomous buffer state. The resulting Grand Duchy of Finland enjoyed wide autonomy within Russia until the end of the nineteenth century, when Russia began attempts to assimilate Finland as part of a general policy to strengthen the central government and unify the Empire by Russification. Those attempts were aborted because of Russia's internal strife, but they ruined Russia's relationship with Finland. In addition, support increased in Finland for self-determination movements.\nWorld War I led to the collapse of the Russian Empire during the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the Russian Civil War. On 15 November 1917, the Bolshevik Russian government declared that national minorities possessed the right of self-determination, including the right to secede and form a separate state, which gave Finland a window of opportunity. On 6 December 1917, the Senate of Finland declared the nation's independence. Soviet Russia, later the Soviet Union, recognised the new Finnish government just three weeks after the declaration. Finland achieved full sovereignty in May 1918 after a four-month civil war in which the conservative Whites defeated the socialist Reds with the help of the Imperial German Army, pro-German J\u00e4gers, and some Swedish troops, in addition to the expulsion of Bolshevik troops.\nFinland joined the League of Nations in 1920 and sought security guarantees, but Finland's primary goal was co-operation with the Scandinavian countries, mainly Sweden, and it focused on the exchange of information and on defence planning (the joint defence of \u00c5land, for example), rather than on military exercises or on the stockpiling and the deployment of materiel. Nevertheless, Sweden carefully avoided committing itself to Finnish foreign policy. Finland's military policy included clandestine defence co-operation with Estonia.\nThe period after the Finnish Civil War to the early 1930s was a politically unstable time in Finland because of the continued rivalry between the conservatives and the socialists. The Communist Party of Finland was declared illegal in 1931, and the nationalist Lapua Movement organised anticommunist violence, which culminated in a failed coup attempt in 1932. The successor of the Lapua Movement, the Patriotic People's Movement, had a minor presence in national politics and never had more than 14 seats of the 200 in the Finnish Parliament. By the late 1930s, the export-oriented Finnish economy was growing and the nation's extreme political movements had diminished.\nAfter Soviet involvement in the Finnish Civil War in 1918, no formal peace treaty was signed. In 1918 and 1919, Finnish volunteers conducted two unsuccessful military incursions across the Soviet border, the Viena and Aunus expeditions, to annex areas in Karelia that according to the Greater Finland ideology would combine all Baltic Finnic peoples into a single state. In 1920, Finnish communists based in Soviet Russia attempted to assassinate the former Finnish White Guard Commander-in-Chief, Marshal Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim. On 14 October 1920, Finland and Soviet Russia signed the Treaty of Tartu, confirming the old border between the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland and Imperial Russia proper as the new Finnish\u2013Soviet border. Finland also received Petsamo Province, with its ice-free harbour on the Arctic Ocean. Despite the signing of the treaty, relations between the two countries remained strained. The Finnish government allowed volunteers to cross the border to support the East Karelian uprising in Russia in 1921, and Finnish communists in the Soviet Union continued to prepare for revenge and staged a cross-border raid into Finland, the Pork Mutiny, in 1922. In 1932, the Soviet\u2013Finnish Non-Aggression Pact was signed between both countries, and it was reaffirmed for ten years in 1934. Foreign trade in Finland was booming, but less than 1% of it was with the Soviet Union. In 1934, the Soviet Union also joined the League of Nations.\nJustification.\nSoviet General Secretary Joseph Stalin regarded it a disappointment that the Soviet Union could not halt the Finnish Revolution. He thought that the pro-Finland movement in Karelia posed a direct threat to Leningrad and that the area and defences of Finland could be used to invade the Soviet Union or restrict fleet movements. Soviet propaganda then painted Finland's leadership as a \"vicious and reactionary fascist clique\". Field Marshal Mannerheim and V\u00e4in\u00f6 Tanner, the leader of the Finnish Social Democratic Party, were targeted for particular scorn. When Stalin gained absolute power through the Great Purge of 1938, the Soviets changed their foreign policy toward Finland and began to pursue the reconquest of the provinces of Tsarist Russia that had been lost during the chaos of the October Revolution of 1917 and the Russian Civil War almost two decades earlier. Soviet leaders believed that the old empire's extended borders provided territorial security and wanted Leningrad, only from the Finnish border, to enjoy a similar level of security against the rising power of Nazi Germany.\nNegotiations.\nIn April 1938, NKVD agent Boris Yartsev contacted Finnish Foreign Minister Rudolf Holsti and Finnish Prime Minister Aimo Cajander, stating that the Soviets did not trust Germany and that war was considered possible between the two countries. The Red Army would not wait passively behind the border but would rather \"advance to meet the enemy\". Finnish representatives assured Yartsev that Finland was committed to a policy of neutrality and that the country would resist any armed incursion. Yartsev suggested that Finland cede or lease some islands in the Gulf of Finland along the seaward approaches to Leningrad, but Finland refused.\nNegotiations continued throughout 1938 without results. The Finnish reception of Soviet entreaties was decidedly cool, as the violent collectivisation and purges in Stalin's Soviet Union resulted in a poor opinion of the country. Most of the Finnish communist elite in the Soviet Union had been executed during the Great Purge, further tarnishing the Soviets' image in Finland. Meanwhile, Finland was attempting to negotiate a military co-operation plan with Sweden and hoping to jointly defend \u00c5land.\nThe Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact in August 1939. It was publicly a non-aggression treaty, but it included a secret protocol in which Central and Eastern European countries were divided into spheres of influence. Finland fell into the Soviet sphere. On 1 September 1939, Germany began its invasion of Poland, and two days later, the United Kingdom and France declared war on Germany. On 17 September, the Soviet invasion of Poland began. After the fall of Poland, Germany and the Soviet Union exchanged occupied Polish lands to establish a new border in accordance with the provisions of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were soon forced to accept treaties that allowed the Soviets to establish military bases on their soil. Estonia accepted the ultimatum by signing the agreement on 28 September. Latvia and Lithuania followed in October. Unlike the three Baltic countries, Finland started a gradual mobilisation under the guise of \"additional refresher training\". The Soviets had already started intensive mobilisation near the Finnish border in 1938\u201339. Assault troops thought to be necessary for the invasion did not begin deployment until October 1939. Operational plans made in September called for the invasion to start in November.\nOn 5 October 1939, the Soviets invited a Finnish delegation to Moscow for negotiations. Juho Kusti Paasikivi, the Finnish envoy to Sweden, was sent to Moscow to represent the Finnish government Furthermore, the negotiations were attended by Stalin in person, signalling the seriousness of the effort. Paasikivi would later recount his surprise over the friendly atmosphere in which the delegation was received, and mentioned the pleasant manners of Stalin towards them.\nThe meetings began on 12 October, with Molotov's offer of a mutual assistance pact, which the Finns immediately refused. To the Finns' surprise, Molotov dropped the offer and instead proposed an exchange of territory. The offer stipulated that the Finnish-Soviet border on the Karelian Isthmus be moved westward to a point only east of Viipuri () and that Finland destroy all existing fortifications on the Karelian Isthmus. Likewise, the delegation demanded the cession of islands in the Gulf of Finland as well as Rybachy Peninsula (). The Finns would also have to lease the Hanko Peninsula for 30 years and to permit the Soviets to establish a military base there. In exchange, the Soviet Union would cede Repola and Poraj\u00e4rvi from Eastern Karelia (2120 square miles), an area twice the size as that of the territory demanded from Finland (1000 square miles).\nThe Soviet offer divided the Finnish government: Gustaf Mannerheim had argued for an agreement, being pessimistic of the Finnish prospects in a war against the Soviet Union. But the Finnish government was reticent in reaching an agreement out of mistrust for Stalin: there was a fear of repeated follow-up demands, which would have put the future of Finnish sovereignty in danger. There were also those, such as Foreign Minister Eljas Erkko and Prime Minister Aimo Cajander, and the Finnish intelligence in general, who mistook the demands and the Soviet military build-up as a mere bluff on the part of Stalin, and were thus disinclined to reach an agreement.\nThe Finns made two counteroffers that would cede the Terijoki area to the Soviet Union. This would have doubled the distance between Leningrad and the Finnish border, but was far less than the Soviets had demanded. The Finns would also cede the islands in the Gulf of Finland, but they would not agree to lease any territory to the USSR for military purposes.\nOn the next meeting on 23 October, Stalin lessened his demands: a reduction in the amount of land demanded in Karelia; a reduction of the Hanko garrison from 5000 to 4000 men; and reducing the length of lease from 30 years to whatever date the ongoing (second world) war in Europe would end. However, this sudden change, contrary to previous statements that Soviet demands were minimalist and thus unalterable, had surprised the Finnish government, and lead them to believe more concession may be forthcoming. Thus, Paasikivi's idea of reaching some sort of compromise by offering the Soviets the island of Jussar\u00f6 and the fort of Ino were refused by Helsinki.\nOn 31 October, Molotov publicly announced the Soviet demands to the Supreme Soviet. This surprised the Finns, and lent credibility to Soviet claims that their demands were minimalist and thus unalterable, as it would have been impossible to reduce them without a loss of prestige after having made them public. However, the Soviet offer was eventually rejected with respect to the opinion of the public and Parliament.\nAt the meeting on 9 November, Paasikivi announced to the attending Stalin and Molotov the Finnish refusal to accept even their reduced demands. The Soviets were visibly surprised. Finnish Foreign Minister V\u00e4ino Tanner later wrote that \"the eyes of our opposite numbers opened wide\". Stalin had asked \"You don't even offer Ino?\" This would become the final meeting: the Soviets stopped responding to further Finnish letters and on 13 November, when the Finnish delegation was recalled from Moscow, no Soviet officials came to see them off. The Finns had left under the expectation that the negotiations would continue. Instead, the Soviet Union ramped up its military preparations.\nThe negotiations had failed, as neither side was willing to substantially reduce their demands, nor was either side able to fully trust the other. The Finns were fearful of an encroachment on their sovereignty, while the Soviets were (claiming to be) fearful of a springboard for international enemies in Finland, in close proximity to Leningrad. No promises to the contrary managed to persuade the other. Additionally, both sides had misunderstood the others position: the Finns had assumed that the Soviets had opened up on a maximalist demand, ready to be traded down smaller. The Soviets instead had stressed the minimalist nature of their demands, and were incredulous over Finnish reluctance to agree. Finally, there was also Stalin's unwillingness or inability to accept that any territorial concessions on the part of Finland would have only been possible by a 4/5th majority in the Finnish parliament. He had mocked such a requirement, proposing that they count his and Molotov's votes, too.\nShelling of Mainila and Soviet intentions.\nOn 26 November 1939, an incident was reported near the Soviet village of Mainila, near the border with Finland. A Soviet border guard post had been shelled by an unknown party resulting, according to Soviet reports, in the deaths of four and injuries of nine border guards. Research conducted by several Finnish and Russian historians later concluded that the shelling was a false flag operation since there were no artillery units there, and it was carried out from the Soviet side of the border by an NKVD unit with the purpose of providing the Soviets with a \"casus belli\" and a pretext to withdraw from the non-aggression pact. Soviet war games held in March 1938 and 1939 had been based on a scenario in which border incidents taking place at the village of Mainila would spark the war.\nMolotov claimed that the incident was a Finnish artillery attack. He demanded that Finland apologise for the incident and to move its forces beyond a line from the border. Finland denied responsibility for the attack, rejected the demands and called for a joint Finnish\u2013Soviet commission to examine the incident. In turn, the Soviet Union claimed that the Finnish response was hostile, renounced the non-aggression pact and severed diplomatic relations with Finland on 28 November. In the following years, Soviet historiography described the incident as Finnish provocation. Doubt on the official Soviet version was cast only in the late 1980s, during the policy of \"glasnost\". The issue has continued to divide Russian historiography even after the end of the Soviet Union in 1991.\nSoviet intentions.\nIn 2013, Russian President Vladimir Putin stated at a meeting with military historians that the Soviets had launched the Winter War to \"correct mistakes\" made in determining the border with Finland after 1917. Opinion on the scale of the initial Soviet invasion decision is divided. The puppet Finnish communist government and the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact's secret protocol is used as proof that the Soviet Union had intended to conquer all of Finland.\nOn 1 December 1939, the Soviet Union formed a puppet government, named the Finnish Democratic Republic, to govern Finland after Soviet conquest. A declaration delivered via TASS stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The People's Government in its present composition regards itself as a provisional government. Immediately upon arrival in Helsinki, capital of the country, it will be reorganised and its composition enlarged by the inclusion of representatives of the various parties and groups participating in the people's front of toilers.\nSoviet leaflets dropped over Helsinki on the first day of the war stated: \"Finnish Comrades! We come to you not as conquerors, but as liberators of the Finnish people from the oppression of the capitalists and the landlords\".\nIn 1939, Soviet military leadership had formulated a realistic and comprehensive plan for the occupation of Finland. However, Joseph Stalin was not pleased with the conservative pace that the operation required and demanded new plans be drawn up. With the new plans, the key deadline for Finland's capitulation was to be Stalin's 60th birthday on 21 December. Convinced of the invasion's forthcoming success, Andrei Zhdanov, chairman of the highest legislative body in the Soviet Union, commissioned a celebratory piece of music from Dmitri Shostakovich, \"Suite on Finnish Themes\", intended to be performed as the marching bands of the Red Army paraded through Helsinki. The Soviets were confident that the Western powers would not come to Finland's aid. Ivan Maisky, the Soviet ambassador to the UK, said: \"Who would help? The Swedes? The British? The Americans? There's no way in hell. There will be a fuss in the press, moral support, moaning and whining. But troops, aircraft, cannons, and machine guns \u2013 no.\"\nHungarian historian Istv\u00e1n Ravasz wrote that the Soviet Central Committee had set out in 1939 that the former borders of the Tsarist Empire were to be restored, including Finland. American political scientist Dan Reiter stated that the Soviets \"sought to impose a regime change\" and thus \"achieve absolute victory\". He quoted Molotov, who had commented in November 1939 on the regime change plan to a Soviet ambassador that the new government \"will not be Soviet, but one of a democratic republic. Nobody is going to set up Soviets over there, but we hope it will be a government we can come to terms with as to ensure the security of Leningrad\". According to Russian historian Yuri Kilin, the Soviet terms encompassed the strongest fortified approaches of the Finnish defences for a reason. He claimed that Stalin had little hope for such a deal but would play for time for the ongoing mobilisation. He stated the objective as being to secure Finland from being used as a staging ground by means of regime change.\nOthers argue against the idea of a complete Soviet conquest. American historian William R. Trotter asserted that Stalin's objective was to secure Leningrad's flank from a possible German invasion through Finland. He stated that \"the strongest argument\" against a Soviet intention of full conquest is that it did not happen in either 1939 or during the Continuation War in 1944 even though Stalin \"could have done so with comparative ease\". Bradley Lightbody wrote that the \"entire Soviet aim had been to make the Soviet border more secure\". In 2002, Russian historian A. Chubaryan stated that no documents had been found in Russian archives that support a Soviet plan to annex Finland. Rather, the objective was to gain Finnish territory and to reinforce Soviet influence in the region.\nAmerican historian Stephen Kotkin also shares the position that the Soviet Union did not aim for annexation. He points out the different treatment Finland was given, compared to the Baltics: unlike the pacts of mutual assistance that the Baltics were pressured into, resulting in their total Sovietization, the Soviets demanded limited territorial concessions from Finland, and even offered land in return, which would not have made sense if full Sovietization was intended. And according to Kotkin, Stalin seemed to be genuinely interested in reaching an agreement during the negotiations: he had personally attended six of the seven meetings with the Finns, and had multiple times reduced his demands. However, mutual mistrust and misunderstandings would mar the negotiations, producing an impasse.\nOpposing forces.\nSoviet military plan.\nBefore the war, Soviet leadership had expected total victory within a few weeks. The Red Army had just completed the invasion of eastern Poland at a cost of fewer than 4,000 casualties after Germany attacked Poland from the west. Stalin's expectations of a quick Soviet triumph were backed up by politician Andrei Zhdanov and military strategist Kliment Voroshilov, but other generals were more reserved. Red Army Chief of Staff Boris Shaposhnikov advocated a narrow-front assault right on the Karelian isthmus. Additionally, Shaposhnikov argued for a fuller build-up, extensive fire support and logistical preparations, a rational order of battle and the deployment of the army's best units. Zhdanov's military commander, Kirill Meretskov, reported, \"The terrain of coming operations is split by lakes, rivers, swamps, and is almost entirely covered by forests... The proper use of our forces will be difficult\". These doubts were not reflected in Meretskov's troop deployments, and he publicly announced that the Finnish campaign would take two weeks at most. Soviet soldiers had even been warned not to cross the border mistakenly into Sweden.\nStalin's purges in the 1930s had devastated the officer corps of the Red Army; those purged included three of its five marshals, 220 of its 264 division or higher-level commanders and 36,761 officers of all ranks. Fewer than half of all the officers remained. They were commonly replaced by soldiers who were less competent but more loyal to their superiors. Unit commanders were overseen by political commissars, whose approval was needed to approve and ratify military decisions, which they evaluated based on their political merits. The dual system further complicated the Soviet chain of command and annulled the independence of commanding officers.\nAfter the Soviet success at the Battles of Khalkhin Gol against Japan, on the USSR's eastern border, Soviet High Command had divided into two factions. One side was represented by the Spanish Civil War veterans General Pavel Rychagov from the Soviet Air Forces; the tank expert General Dmitry Pavlov and Stalin's favourite general, Marshal Grigory Kulik, the chief of artillery. The other faction was led by Khalkhin Gol veterans General Georgy Zhukov of the Red Army and General Grigory Kravchenko of the Soviet Air Forces. Under this divided command structure, the lessons of the Soviet Union's \"first real war on a massive scale using tanks, artillery, and aircraft\" at Khalkin Gol went unheeded. As a result, Russian BT tanks were less successful during the Winter War, and it took the Soviet Union three months and over a million men to accomplish what Zhukov had managed at Khalkhin Gol in ten days (albeit in completely different circumstances).\nSoviet order of battle.\nSoviet generals were impressed by the success of German \"Blitzkrieg\" tactics, but they had been tailored to conditions in Central Europe, with its dense well-mapped network of paved roads. Armies fighting there had recognised supply and communications centres, which could be easily targeted by armoured vehicle regiments. Finnish Army centres, in contrast, were deep inside the country. There were no paved roads, and even gravel or dirt roads were scarce. Most of the terrain consisted of trackless forests and swamps. The war correspondent John Langdon-Davies observed the landscape: \"Every acre of its surface was created to be the despair of an attacking military force\". Waging \"Blitzkrieg\" in Finland was a highly-difficult proposition, and according to Trotter, the Red Army failed to meet the level of tactical co-ordination and local initiative that would be required to execute such tactics in Finland.\nCommander of the Leningrad Military District Kiril Meretskov initially ran the overall operation against the Finns. The command was passed on 9 December 1939 to the General Staff Supreme Command (later known as Stavka), directly under Kliment Voroshilov (chairman), Nikolai Kuznetsov, Stalin and Boris Shaposhnikov. On 28 December, when Stalin asked for volunteers to take over military command, Semyon Timoshenko offered himself on the condition that he be allowed to implement Shaposhnikov's initial plan of a focused attack on the Karelian Isthmus to break the Mannerheim Line; it was accepted. In January 1940, the Leningrad Military District was reformed and renamed \"North-Western Front\".\nThe Soviet forces were organised as follows:\nFinnish order of battle.\nThe Finnish strategy was dictated by geography. The border with the Soviet Union was mostly impassable except along a handful of unpaved roads. In prewar calculations, the Finnish Defence Command, which had established its wartime headquarters at Mikkeli, had estimated seven Soviet divisions on the Karelian Isthmus and no more than five along the whole border north of Lake Ladoga. In the estimation, the manpower ratio would have favoured the attacker by three to one. The true ratio was much higher, however, since for example, 12 Soviet divisions were deployed north of Lake Ladoga.\nFinland had a large force of reservists, which was trained in regular maneuvers, some of which had experience from the recent Finnish Civil War. The soldiers were also almost universally trained in basic survival techniques, such as skiing. The Finnish Army was not able to equip all its soldiers with proper uniforms at the outbreak of war, but its reservists were equipped with warm civilian clothing. However, the sparsely populated, highly agrarian Finland had to draft so many of its working men that the Finnish economy was massively strained because of a lack of workers. An even greater problem than lack of soldiers was the lack of materiel since foreign shipments of anti-tank weapons and aircraft were arriving only in small quantities. The ammunition situation was alarming, as stockpiles had cartridges, shells and fuel to last only 19 to 60 days. The ammunition shortage meant the Finns could seldom afford counter-battery or saturation fire. Finnish tank forces were operationally nonexistent. The ammunition situation was alleviated somewhat since Finns were largely armed with Mosin\u2013Nagant rifles dating from the Finnish Civil War, which used the same 7.62\u00d754mmR cartridge that was used by Soviet forces. The situation was so severe that Finnish soldiers sometimes had to maintain their ammunition supply by looting the bodies of dead Soviet soldiers.\nThe Finnish forces were positioned as follows:\nSoviet invasion.\nStart of invasion and political operations.\nOn 30 November 1939, Soviet forces invaded Finland with 21 divisions, totalling 450,000 men, and bombed Helsinki, killing about 100 citizens and destroying more than 50 buildings. In response to international criticism, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov stated that the Soviet Air Force was not bombing Finnish cities but rather dropping humanitarian aid to the starving Finnish population; the bombs were sarcastically dubbed Molotov bread baskets by Finns. The Finnish statesman J. K. Paasikivi commented that the Soviet attack without a declaration of war violated three separate non-aggression pacts: the Treaty of Tartu, which was signed in 1920, the non-aggression pact between Finland and the Soviet Union, which was signed in 1932 and again in 1934; and also the Covenant of the League of Nations, which the Soviet Union signed in 1934. Field Marshal C.G.E. Mannerheim was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Finnish Defence Forces after the Soviet attack. In a further reshuffling, Aimo Cajander's caretaker cabinet was replaced by Risto Ryti and his cabinet, with V\u00e4in\u00f6 Tanner as foreign minister because of opposition to Cajander's prewar politics. Finland brought the matter of the Soviet invasion before the League of Nations. The League expelled the Soviet Union on 14 December 1939 and exhorted its members to aid Finland.\nHeaded by Otto Wille Kuusinen, the Finnish Democratic Republic puppet government operated in the parts of Finnish Karelia occupied by the Soviets, and was also referred to as the \"Terijoki Government\", after the village of Terijoki, the first settlement captured by the advancing Red Army. After the war, the puppet government was reabsorbed into the Soviet Union. From the very outset of the war, working-class Finns stood behind the legitimate government in Helsinki. Finnish national unity against the Soviet invasion was later called the spirit of the Winter War.\nFirst battles and Soviet advance to Mannerheim Line.\nThe array of Finnish defence structures that during the war started to be called the Mannerheim Line was located on the Karelian Isthmus approximately from the Soviet border. The Red Army soldiers on the Isthmus numbered 250,000, facing 130,000 Finns. The Finnish command deployed a defence in depth of about 21,000 men in the area in front of the Mannerheim Line to delay and damage the Red Army before it reached the line. In combat, the most severe cause of confusion among Finnish soldiers was Soviet tanks. The Finns had few anti-tank weapons and insufficient training in modern anti-tank tactics. According to Trotter, the favoured Soviet armoured tactic was a simple frontal charge, the weaknesses of which could be exploited. The Finns learned that at close range, tanks could be dealt with in many ways; for example, logs and crowbars jammed into the bogie wheels would often immobilise a tank. Soon, Finns fielded a better ad hoc weapon, the Molotov cocktail, a glass bottle filled with flammable liquids and with a simple hand-lit fuse. Molotov cocktails were eventually mass-produced by the Finnish \"Alko\" alcoholic-beverage corporation and bundled with matches with which to light them. 80 Soviet tanks were destroyed in the border zone engagements.\nBy 6 December, all of the Finnish covering forces had withdrawn to the Mannerheim Line. The Red Army began its first major attack against the Line in Taipale\u00a0\u2013 the area between the shore of Lake Ladoga, the Taipale river and the Suvanto waterway. Along the Suvanto sector, the Finns had a slight advantage of elevation and dry ground to dig into. The Finnish artillery had scouted the area and made fire plans in advance, anticipating a Soviet assault. The Battle of Taipale began with a forty-hour Soviet artillery preparation. After the barrage, Soviet infantry attacked across open ground but was repulsed with heavy casualties. From 6 to 12 December, the Red Army continued to try to engage using only a single division. Next, the Red Army strengthened its artillery and deployed tanks and the 150th Rifle Division forward to the Taipale front. On 14 December, the bolstered Soviet forces launched a new attack but were pushed back again. A third Soviet division entered the fight but performed poorly and panicked under shell fire. The assaults continued without success, and the Red Army suffered heavy losses. One typical Soviet attack during the battle lasted just an hour but left 1,000 dead and 27 tanks strewn on the ice. North of Lake Ladoga on the Ladoga Karelia front, the defending Finnish units relied on the terrain. Ladoga Karelia, a large forest wilderness, did not have road networks for the modern Red Army. The Soviet 8th Army had extended a new railroad line to the border, which could double the supply capability on the front. On 12 December, the advancing Soviet 139th Rifle Division, supported by the 56th Rifle Division, was defeated by a much smaller Finnish force under Paavo Talvela in Tolvaj\u00e4rvi, the first Finnish victory of the war.\nIn Central and Northern Finland, roads were few and the terrain hostile. The Finns did not expect large-scale Soviet attacks, but the Soviets sent eight divisions, heavily supported by armour and artillery. The 155th Rifle Division attacked at Ilomantsi and Lieksa, and further north the 44th attacked at Kuhmo. The 163rd Rifle Division was deployed at Suomussalmi and ordered to cut Finland in half by advancing on Raate road. In Finnish Lapland, the Soviet 88th and 122nd Rifle Divisions attacked at Salla. The Arctic port of Petsamo was attacked by the 104th Mountain Rifle Division by sea and land, supported by naval gunfire.\nOperations from December to January.\nWeather conditions.\nThe winter of 1939\u201340 was exceptionally cold with the Karelian Isthmus experiencing a record low temperature of on 16 January 1940. At the beginning of the war, only those Finnish soldiers who were in active service had uniforms and weapons. The rest had to make do with their own clothing, which for many soldiers was their normal winter clothing with a semblance of insignia added. Finnish soldiers were skilled in cross-country skiing. The cold, snow, forest, and long hours of darkness were factors that the Finns could use to their advantage. The Finns dressed in layers, and the ski troopers wore a lightweight white snow cape. This snow-camouflage made the ski troopers almost invisible so that they could more easily execute guerrilla attacks against Soviet columns. At the beginning of the war, Soviet tanks were painted in standard olive drab and men dressed in regular khaki uniforms. Not until late January 1940 did the Soviets paint their equipment white and issue snowsuits to their infantry.\nMost Soviet soldiers had proper winter clothes, but this was not the case with every unit. In the Battle of Suomussalmi, thousands of Soviet soldiers died of frostbite. The Soviet troops also lacked skill in skiing, so soldiers were restricted to movement by road and were forced to move in long columns. The Red Army lacked proper winter tents, and troops had to sleep in improvised shelters. Some Soviet units incurred frostbite casualties as high as ten per cent even before crossing the Finnish border. However, the cold weather did give an advantage to Soviet tanks, as they could move over frozen terrain and bodies of water, rather than being immobilised in swamps and mud. According to Krivosheev, at least 61,506 Soviet troops were sick or frostbitten during the war.\nFinnish guerrilla tactics.\nIn battles from Ladoga Karelia to the Arctic port of Petsamo, the Finns used guerrilla tactics. The Red Army was superior in numbers and material, but Finns used the advantages of speed, manoeuvre warfare and economy of force. Particularly on the Ladoga Karelia front and during the Battle of Raate Road, the Finns isolated smaller portions of numerically superior Soviet forces. With Soviet forces divided into smaller groups, the Finns dealt with them individually and attacked from all sides.\nFor many of the encircled Soviet troops in a pocket (called a \"motti\" in Finnish, originally meaning of firewood), staying alive was an ordeal comparable to combat. The men were freezing and starving and endured poor sanitary conditions. Historian William R. Trotter described these conditions as follows: \"The Soviet soldier had no choice. If he refused to fight, he would be shot. If he tried to sneak through the forest, he would freeze to death. And surrender was no option for him; Soviet propaganda had told him how the Finns would torture prisoners to death.\" The problem however was that the Finns were mostly too weak to fully exploit their success. Some of the pockets of encircled Soviet soldiers held out for weeks and even months, binding a huge number of Finnish forces.\nBattles of the Mannerheim Line.\nThe terrain on the Karelian Isthmus did not allow guerrilla tactics, so the Finns were forced to resort to the more conventional Mannerheim Line, with its flanks protected by large bodies of water. Soviet propaganda claimed that it was as strong as or even stronger than the Maginot Line. Finnish historians, for their part, have belittled the line's strength, insisting that it was mostly conventional trenches and log-covered dugouts. The Finns had built 221 strong-points along the Karelian Isthmus, mostly in the early 1920s. Many were extended in the late 1930s. Despite these defensive preparations, even the most fortified section of the Mannerheim Line had only one reinforced-concrete bunker per kilometre. Overall, the line was weaker than similar lines in mainland Europe. According to the Finns, the real strength of the line was the \"stubborn defenders with a lot of \"sisu\"\" \u2013 a Finnish idiom roughly translated as \"guts, fighting spirit\".\nOn the eastern side of the Isthmus, the Red Army attempted to break through the Mannerheim Line at the battle of Taipale. On the western side, Soviet units faced the Finnish line at Summa, near the city of Viipuri, on 16 December. The Finns had built 41 reinforced-concrete bunkers in the Summa area, making the defensive line in this area stronger than anywhere else on the Karelian Isthmus. Because of a mistake in planning, the nearby Munasuo swamp had a -wide gap in the line. During the First Battle of Summa, a number of Soviet tanks broke through the thin line on 19 December, but the Soviets could not benefit from the situation because of insufficient co-operation between branches of service. The Finns remained in their trenches, allowing the Soviet tanks to move freely behind the Finnish line, as the Finns had no proper anti-tank weapons. The Finns succeeded in repelling the main Soviet assault. The tanks, stranded behind enemy lines, attacked the strongpoints at random until they were eventually destroyed, 20 in all. By 22 December, the battle ended in a Finnish victory.\nThe Soviet advance was stopped at the Mannerheim Line. Red Army troops suffered from poor morale and a shortage of supplies, eventually refusing to participate in more suicidal frontal attacks. The Finns, led by General Harald \u00d6hquist, decided to launch a counter-attack and encircle three Soviet divisions into a \"motti\" near Viipuri on 23 December. \u00d6hquist's plan was bold; however it failed. The Finns lost 1,300 men, and the Soviets were later estimated to have lost a similar number.\nBattles in Ladoga Karelia and North Karelia.\nThe strength of the Red Army north of Lake Ladoga in Ladoga Karelia surprised the Finnish Headquarters. Two Finnish divisions were deployed there, the 12th Division led by Lauri Tiainen and the 13th Division led by Hannu Hannuksela. They also had a support group of three brigades, bringing their total strength to over 30,000. The Soviets deployed a division for almost every road leading west to the Finnish border. The 8th Army was led by Ivan Khabarov, who was replaced by Grigory Shtern on 13 December. The Soviets' mission was to destroy the Finnish troops in the area of Ladoga Karelia and advance into the area between Sortavala and Joensuu within 10 days. The Soviets had a 3:1 advantage in manpower and a 5:1 advantage in artillery, as well as air supremacy.\nFinnish forces panicked and retreated in front of the overwhelming Red Army. The commander of the Finnish IV Army Corps Juho Heiskanen was replaced by Woldemar H\u00e4gglund on 4 December. On 7 December, in the middle of the Ladoga Karelian front, Finnish units retreated near the small stream of Kollaa. The waterway itself did not offer protection, but alongside it, there were ridges up to high. The ensuing Battle of Kollaa lasted until the end of the war. A memorable quote, \"Kollaa holds\" () became a legendary motto among Finns. Further contributing to the legend of Kollaa was the sniper Simo H\u00e4yh\u00e4, dubbed \"the White Death\" in Finnish media, credited with over 500 kills in the war. Captain Aarne Juutilainen, dubbed \"the Terror of Morocco\", also became a living legend in the Battle of Kollaa. To the north, the Finns retreated from \u00c4gl\u00e4j\u00e4rvi to Tolvaj\u00e4rvi on 5 December and then repelled a Soviet offensive in the battle of Tolvaj\u00e4rvi on 11 December.\nIn the south, two Soviet divisions were united on the northern side of the Lake Ladoga coastal road. As before, these divisions were trapped as the more mobile Finnish units counterattacked from the north to flank the Soviet columns. On 19 December, the Finns temporarily ceased their assaults due to exhaustion. It was not until the period of 6\u201316 January 1940 that the Finns resumed their offensive, dividing Soviet divisions into smaller \"mottis.\" Contrary to Finnish expectations, the encircled Soviet divisions did not try to break through to the east but instead entrenched. They were expecting reinforcements and supplies to arrive by air. As the Finns lacked the necessary heavy artillery equipment and were short of men, they often did not directly attack the \"mottis\" they had created; instead, they worked to eliminate only the most dangerous threats. Often the \"motti\" tactic was not applied as a strategy, but as a Finnish adaptation to the behaviour of Soviet troops under fire. In spite of the cold and hunger, the Soviet troops did not surrender easily but fought bravely, often entrenching their tanks to be used as pillboxes and building timber dugouts. Some specialist Finnish soldiers were called in to attack the \"mottis\"; the most famous of them was Major Matti Aarnio, or \"Motti-Matti\" as he became known.\nIn North Karelia, Soviet forces were outmanoeuvred at Ilomantsi and Lieksa. The Finns used effective guerrilla tactics, taking special advantage of their superior skiing skills and snow-white layered clothing and executing surprise ambushes and raids. By the end of December, the Soviets decided to retreat and transfer resources to more critical fronts.\nBattles in Kainuu.\nThe Suomussalmi\u2013Raate engagement was a double operation which would later be used by military academics as a classic example of what well-led troops and innovative tactics can do against a much larger adversary. In 1939, Suomussalmi was a municipality of 4,000 inhabitants, with long lakes, wild forests and few roads. The Finnish command believed that the Soviets would not attack there, but the Red Army committed two divisions to the Kainuu area with orders to cross the wilderness, capture the city of Oulu and effectively cut Finland in two. There were two roads leading to Suomussalmi from the frontier: the northern Juntusranta road and the southern Raate road.\nThe Battle of Raate Road, which occurred during the month-long Battle of Suomussalmi, resulted in one of the largest Soviet losses in the Winter War. The Soviet 44th and parts of the 163rd Rifle Division, comprising about 14,000 troops, were almost completely destroyed by a Finnish ambush as they marched along the forest road. A small unit blocked the Soviet advance while Finnish Colonel Hjalmar Siilasvuo and his 9th Division cut off the retreat route, split the enemy force into smaller \"mottis\", and then proceeded to destroy the remnants in detail as they retreated. The Soviets suffered 7,000\u20139,000 casualties; the Finnish units, 400. The Finnish troops captured dozens of tanks, artillery pieces, anti-tank guns, hundreds of trucks, almost 2,000 horses, thousands of rifles, and much-needed ammunition and medical supplies. So sure of their victory had the Soviets been that a military band, complete with instruments, banners and notes, was traveling with the 44th Division to perform in a victory parade. The Finns found their instruments among the captured materiel.\nBattles in Finnish Lapland.\nThe Finnish area of Lapland, bestriding the Arctic Circle, is sparsely developed, with little daylight and persistent snow-cover during winter; the Finns expected nothing more than raiding parties and reconnaissance patrols. Instead, the Soviets sent full divisions. On 11 December, the Finns rearranged the defence of Lapland and detached the Lapland Group from the North Finland Group. The group was placed under the command of Kurt Wallenius.\nIn southern Lapland, near the village of Salla, the Soviet 88th and 122nd Divisions, totaling 35,000 men, advanced. In the Battle of Salla, the Soviets proceeded easily to Salla, where the road split. Further ahead was Kemij\u00e4rvi, while the fork to Pelkosenniemi led northwest. On 17 December, the Soviet northern group, comprising an infantry regiment, a battalion, and a company of tanks, was outflanked by a Finnish battalion. The 122nd retreated, abandoning much of its heavy equipment and vehicles. Following this success, the Finns shuttled reinforcements to the defensive line in front of Kemij\u00e4rvi. The Soviets hammered the defensive line without success. The Finns counter-attacked, and the Soviets retreated to a new defensive line where they stayed for the rest of the war.\nTo the north was Finland's only ice-free port in the Arctic, Petsamo. The Finns lacked the manpower to defend it fully, as the main front was distant at the Karelian Isthmus. In the Battle of Petsamo, the Soviet 104th Division attacked the Finnish 104th Independent Cover Company. The Finns abandoned Petsamo and concentrated on delaying actions. The area was treeless, windy, and relatively low, offering little defensible terrain. The almost constant darkness and extreme temperatures of the Lapland winter benefited the Finns, who executed guerrilla attacks against Soviet supply lines and patrols. As a result, the Soviet movements were halted by the efforts of one-fifth as many Finns.\nAerial warfare.\nSoviet Air Force.\nThe USSR enjoyed air superiority throughout the war. The Soviet Air Force, supporting the Red Army's invasion with about 2,500 aircraft (the most common type being Tupolev SB), was not as effective as the Soviets might have hoped. The material damage by the bomb raids was slight as Finland offered few valuable targets for strategic bombing. For example, the city of Tampere was one of the most important targets because it was an important railway junction, and also housed State Aircraft Factory and the Tampere Linen and Iron Industry premises, which manufactured munitions and weapons, including grenade launchers. Often, targets were village depots with little value. The country had few modern highways in the interior, therefore making the railways the main targets for bombers. Rail tracks were cut thousands of times but the Finns hastily repaired them and service resumed within a matter of hours. The Soviet Air Force learned from its early mistakes, and by late February instituted more effective tactics.\nThe largest bombing raid against the capital of Finland, Helsinki, occurred on the first day of the war. The capital was bombed only a few times thereafter. All in all, Soviet bombings cost Finland five per cent of its total man-hour production. Nevertheless, Soviet air attacks affected thousands of civilians, killing 957. The Soviets recorded 2,075 bombing attacks in 516 localities. The city of Viipuri, a major Soviet objective close to the Karelian Isthmus front, was almost levelled by nearly 12,000 bombs. No attacks on civilian targets were mentioned in Soviet radio or newspaper reports. In January 1940, the Soviet \"Pravda\" newspaper continued to lie that no civilian targets in Finland had been struck, even accidentally. It is estimated that the Soviet air force lost about 400 aircraft because of inclement weather, lack of fuel and tools, and during transport to the front. The Soviet Air Force flew approximately 44,000 sorties during the war.\nFinnish Air Force.\nAt the beginning of the war, Finland had a small air force, with only 114 combat planes fit for duty. Missions were limited, and fighter aircraft were mainly used to repel Soviet bombers. Strategic bombings doubled as opportunities for military reconnaissance. Old-fashioned and few in number, aircraft offered little support for Finnish ground troops. In spite of losses, the number of planes in the Finnish Air Force rose by over 50 per cent by the end of the war. The Finns received shipments of British, French, Italian, Swedish and American aircraft.\nFinnish fighter pilots often flew their motley collection of planes into Soviet formations that outnumbered them 10 or even 20 times. Finnish fighters shot down 200 Soviet aircraft, while losing 62 of their own on all causes. Finnish anti-aircraft guns downed more than 300 enemy aircraft. Often, a Finnish forward air base consisted of a frozen lake, a windsock, a telephone set and some tents. Air-raid warnings were given by Finnish women organised by the Lotta Sv\u00e4rd. The top scoring fighter ace was Jorma Sarvanto, with 12.83 victories. He would increase his tally during the Continuation War.\nNaval warfare.\nNaval activity.\nThere was little naval activity during the Winter War. The Baltic Sea began to freeze over by the end of December, impeding the movement of warships; by mid-winter, only ice breakers and submarines could still move. The other reason for low naval activity was the nature of Soviet Navy forces in the area. The Baltic Fleet was a coastal defence force which did not have the training, logistical structure, or landing craft to undertake large-scale operations. The Baltic Fleet possessed two battleships, one heavy cruiser, almost 20 destroyers, 50 motor torpedo boats, 52 submarines, and other miscellaneous vessels. The Soviets used naval bases in Paldiski, Tallinn and Liep\u0101ja for their operations.\nThe Finnish Navy was a coastal defence force with two coastal defence ships, five submarines, four gunboats, seven motor torpedo boats, one minelayer and six minesweepers and at least 5 icebreakers. The two coastal defence ships, and , were moved to harbour in Turku where they were used to bolster the air defence. Their anti-aircraft guns shot down one or two planes over the city, and the ships remained there for the rest of the war. At 18 January, Finnish armed icebreaker \"Tarmo\" was severely damaged at Kotka, received 2 bombs from a Soviet bomber with 39 Finnish troops killed in action. As well as coastal defence, the Finnish Navy protected the \u00c5landish and Finnish merchant vessels in the Baltic Sea.\nSoviet aircraft bombed Finnish vessels and harbours and dropped mines into Finnish seaways. Still, only five merchant ships were lost to Soviet action. World War II, which had started before the Winter War, proved more costly for the Finnish merchant vessels, with 26 lost due to hostile action in 1939 and 1940.\nCoastal artillery.\nFinnish coastal artillery batteries defended important harbours and naval bases. Most batteries were left over from the Imperial Russian period, with guns being the most numerous. Finland attempted to modernise its old guns and installed a number of new batteries, the largest of which featured a gun battery on the island of Kuivasaari in front of Helsinki, originally intended to block the Gulf of Finland to Soviet ships with the help of batteries on the Estonian side.\nThe first naval battle occurred in the Gulf of Finland on 1 December, near the island of Russar\u00f6, south of Hanko. That day, the weather was fair and visibility was excellent. The Finns spotted the Soviet cruiser and two destroyers. When the ships were at a range of , the Finns opened fire with four coastal guns. After five minutes of firing by the coastal guns, the cruiser had been damaged by near misses and retreated. The destroyers remained undamaged, but the \"Kirov\" suffered 17 dead and 30 wounded. The Soviets already knew the locations of the Finnish coastal batteries, but were surprised by their range.\nCoastal artillery had a greater effect on land by reinforcing defence in conjunction with army artillery. Two sets of fortress artillery made significant contributions to the early battles on the Karelian Isthmus and in Ladoga Karelia. These were located at Kaarnajoki on the Eastern Isthmus and at Mantsi on the northeastern shore of Lake Ladoga. The fortress of Koivisto provided similar support from the southwestern coast of the Isthmus.\nSoviet breakthrough in February.\nRed Army reforms and offensive preparations.\nJoseph Stalin was not pleased with the results of December 1939 in the Finnish campaign. The Red Army had been humiliated in defeats by smaller Finnish forces. By the third week of the war, Soviet propaganda was already working to explain the failures of the Soviet military to the populace: blaming bad terrain and harsh climate, and falsely claiming that the Mannerheim Line was stronger than the Maginot Line, and that the Americans had sent 1,000 of their best pilots to Finland. However, the Soviets were confronted with the unavoidable reality of the poor performance of their troops against the Finns. Stalin in particular was concerned about the effects of the war on Soviet reputation. In late December, the Soviets decided to reduce their strategic objectives and focused on bringing the war to an end.\nChief of Staff Boris Shaposhnikov was given full authority over operations in the Finnish theatre, and he ordered the suspension of frontal assaults in late December. Kliment Voroshilov was replaced with Semyon Timoshenko as the commander of the Soviet forces in the war on 7 January 1940. The main focus of the Soviet attack was switched to the Karelian Isthmus. Timoshenko and Zhdanov reorganised and tightened control between different branches of service in the Red Army. They also changed tactical doctrines to meet the realities of the situation.\nThe Soviet forces on the Karelian Isthmus were divided into two armies: the 7th and the 13th Army. The 7th Army, now under Kirill Meretskov, would concentrate 75 per cent of its strength against the stretch of the Mannerheim Line between Taipale and the Munasuo swamp. Tactics would be basic: an armoured wedge for the initial breakthrough, followed by the main infantry and vehicle assault force. The Red Army would prepare by pinpointing the Finnish frontline fortifications. The 123rd Rifle Division then rehearsed the assault on life-size mock-ups. The Soviets shipped large numbers of new tanks and artillery pieces to the theatre. Troops were increased from ten divisions to 25\u201326 divisions with six or seven tank brigades and several independent tank platoons as support, totalling 600,000 soldiers. On 1 February, the Red Army began a large offensive, firing 300,000 shells into the Finnish line in the first 24\u00a0hours of the bombardment.\nSoviet offensive on the Karelian Isthmus.\nAlthough the Karelian Isthmus front was less active in January than in December, the Soviets increased bombardments, wearing down the defenders and softening their fortifications. During daylight hours, the Finns took shelter inside their fortifications from the bombardments and repaired damage during the night. The situation led quickly to war exhaustion among the Finns, who lost over 3,000 soldiers in trench warfare. The Soviets also made occasional small infantry assaults with one or two companies. Because of the shortage of ammunition, Finnish artillery emplacements were under orders to fire only against directly threatening ground attacks. On 1 February, the Soviets further escalated their artillery and air bombardments.\nEven though the Soviets refined their tactics and morale improved, the generals were still willing to accept massive losses to reach their objectives. Soviet attacks were now being screened by smoke, heavy artillery, and armour support, but the infantry charged in the open and in dense formations. Unlike their tactics in December, Soviet tanks advanced in smaller numbers. The Finns could not easily eliminate tanks if infantry troops protected them. After 10 days of constant artillery barrage, the Soviets achieved a breakthrough on the Western Karelian Isthmus in the Second Battle of Summa.\nBy 11 February, the Soviets had approximately 460,000 soldiers, 3,350 artillery pieces, 3,000 tanks and 1,300 aircraft deployed on the Karelian Isthmus. The Red Army was constantly receiving new recruits after the breakthrough. Opposing them, the Finns had eight divisions, totalling about 150,000 soldiers. One by one, the defenders' strongholds crumbled under the Soviet attacks and the Finns were forced to retreat. On 15 February, Mannerheim authorised a general retreat of the II Corps to a fallback line of defence. On the eastern side of the isthmus, the Finns continued to resist Soviet assaults, achieving a stalemate in the Battle of Taipale.\nPeace negotiations.\nWhile the Finns attempted to re-open negotiations with Moscow by every means during the war, the Soviets did not respond. In early January, Finnish communist Hella Wuolijoki contacted the Finnish Government. She offered to contact Moscow through the Soviet Union's ambassador to Sweden, Alexandra Kollontai. Wuolijoki departed for Stockholm and met Kollontai secretly at a hotel. On 29 January, Molotov put an end to the puppet Terijoki Government and recognized the Ryti\u2013Tanner government as the legal government of Finland, informing it that the USSR was willing to negotiate peace.\nBy mid-February, it became clear that the Finnish forces were rapidly approaching exhaustion. For the Soviets, casualties were high, the situation was a source of political embarrassment to the Soviet regime, and there was a risk of Franco-British intervention (which was overestimated by Soviet intelligence in February and March 1940). With the spring thaw approaching, the Soviet forces risked becoming bogged down in the forests. Finnish Foreign Minister V\u00e4in\u00f6 Tanner arrived in Stockholm on 12 February and negotiated the peace terms with the Soviets through the Swedes. German representatives, not aware that the negotiations were underway, suggested on 17 February that Finland negotiate with the Soviet Union.\nBoth Germany and Sweden were keen to see an end to the Winter War. The Germans feared losing the iron ore fields in Northern Sweden and threatened to attack at once if the Swedes granted the Allied forces right of passage. The German invasion plan, named \"Studie Nord\", was later implemented as Operation Weser\u00fcbung. Leon Trotsky opined after the war that Hitler would view a Soviet occupation of Finland as a threat to this plan. Any potential German plans for bases in Finland would also be thwarted if the Soviets occupied Finland, though Trotsky himself believed that Hitler was not interested in occupying Finland, but rather its role as a buffer between Germany and the USSR.\nAs the Finnish Cabinet dithered in the face of harsh Soviet conditions, Sweden's King Gustav\u00a0V made a public statement on 19 February in which he confirmed having declined Finnish pleas for support from Swedish troops. On 25 February, the Soviet peace terms were spelt out in detail. On 29 February, the Finnish Government accepted the Soviet terms in principle and was willing to enter into negotiations. Red Army commanders wished to continue the war as their forces were starting to make progress against the Finns, whereas the Communist Party pointed out that the war was becoming too costly and called for the signing of a peace treaty. The party believed that Finland could be taken over later by means of a revolution. The heated discussion that ensued failed to yield any clear result and the matter went to a vote, in which the party's opinion prevailed and the decision was taken to bring hostilities to an end.\nEnd of war in March.\nOn 5 March, the Red Army advanced past the Mannerheim Line and entered the suburbs of Viipuri. The same day, the Red Army established a beachhead on the Western Gulf of Viipuri. The Finns proposed an armistice on 6 March, but the Soviets, wanting to keep the pressure on the Finnish government, declined the offer. The Finnish peace delegation travelled to Moscow via Stockholm and arrived on 7 March. They were disappointed to find that Stalin was not present during peace negotiations, likely due to the Red Army's humiliation by the Finns. The Soviets had further demands, as their military position was strong and improving. On 9 March, the Finnish military situation on the Karelian Isthmus was dire, as troops were experiencing heavy casualties. Artillery ammunition was exhausted and weapons were wearing out. The Finnish government, realizing that the hoped-for Franco-British military expedition would not arrive in time, as Norway and Sweden had not given the Allies right of passage, had little choice but to accept the Soviet terms. Finnish President Ky\u00f6sti Kallio resisted the idea of giving up any territory to the Soviet Union, but eventually agreed to sign the Moscow Peace Treaty. When he signed the document, the tormented president uttered the well-known words: \"Let the hand wither that signs this monstrous treaty!\"\nMoscow Peace Treaty.\nThe Moscow Peace Treaty was signed in Moscow on 12 March 1940. A cease-fire took effect the next day at noon Leningrad time, 11\u00a0a.m. Helsinki time. With it, Finland ceded the Karelian Isthmus and most of Ladoga Karelia. The area included Viipuri (Finland's second-largest city [Population Register] or fourth-largest city [Church and Civil Register], depending on the census data), much of Finland's industrialised territory, and significant land still held by Finland's military\u00a0\u2013 all in all, nine per cent of Finnish territory. The ceded territory included 13 per cent of Finland's economic assets. 12 per cent of Finland's population, 422,000 to 450,000 Karelians, were evacuated and lost their homes. Finland also ceded a part of the region of Salla, the Rybachy Peninsula in the Barents Sea, and four islands in the Gulf of Finland. The Hanko peninsula was leased to the Soviet Union as a military base for 30 years. The region of Petsamo, captured by the Red Army during the war, was returned to Finland according to the treaty.\nFinnish concessions and territorial losses exceeded Soviet pre-war demands. Before the war, the Soviet Union demanded for the frontier with Finland on the Karelian Isthmus to be moved westward to a point east of Viipuri to the line between Koivisto and Lipola; for existing fortifications on the Karelian Isthmus to be demolished and for the islands of Suursaari, Tyt\u00e4rsaari, and Koivisto in the Gulf of Finland and Rybachy Peninsula to be ceded. In exchange, the Soviet Union proposed to cede Repola and Poraj\u00e4rvi from Eastern Karelia, an area twice as large as the territories that were originally demanded from the Finns.\nForeign support.\nForeign volunteers.\nWorld opinion largely supported the Finnish cause, and the Soviet aggression was generally deemed unjustified. World War II had not yet directly affected France, the United Kingdom or the United States; the Winter War was practically the only conflict in Europe at that time and thus held major world interest. Several foreign organisations sent material aid, and many countries granted credit and military materiel to Finland. Nazi Germany allowed arms to pass through its territory to Finland, but after a Swedish newspaper made this public, Adolf Hitler initiated a policy of silence towards Finland, as part of improved German\u2013Soviet relations following the signing of the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact.\nThe largest foreign contingent came from neighboring Sweden, which provided nearly 8,760 volunteers during the war. The Volunteer Corps was formed of predominantly Swedes, as well as 1,010 Danes and 727 Norwegians. They fought on the northern front at Salla during the last days of the war. A Swedish unit of Gloster Gladiator fighters, named \"the Flight Regiment 19\" also participated. Swedish anti-air batteries with Bofors guns were responsible for air defence in northern Finland and the city of Turku. Volunteers arrived from Hungary, Italy and Estonia. 350 American nationals of Finnish background volunteered, and 210 volunteers of other nationalities arrived in Finland before the war ended. Max Manus, a Norwegian, fought in the Winter War before returning to Norway and later achieved fame as a resistance fighter during the German occupation of Norway. In total, Finland received 12,000 volunteers, 50 of whom died during the war. The British actor Christopher Lee volunteered in the war for two weeks, but did not face combat.\nWhite \u00e9migr\u00e9s and Russian prisoners-of-war.\nFinland officially refused overtures from the anti-Soviet Russian All-Military Union (ROVS) for aid. Nevertheless, Mannerheim eventually agreed to establish a small Russian detachment (\"Russkaya narodnaya armiya\", RNA) of 200 men after being introduced to Boris Bazhanov, a high-ranking ROVS member, in person in January 1940. The project was deemed top secret, and was under the auspices of the intelligence division of the Finnish army headquarters.\nThe ranks of RNA were to be filled by prisoners-of-war, but it would be commanded by White \u00e9migr\u00e9s instead of captured Soviet Army officers, who were deemed unreliable. Bazhanov's Finnish assistant Feodor Schulgin chose Captain Vladimir Kiseleff, Lieutenant Vladimir Lugovskoy, Anatoly Budyansky and brothers Nikolay and Vladimir Bastamov as officers for the unit. Of the five, the Bastamovs were not Finnish citizens, but had Nansen passports. The prisoners-of-war were trained in Huittinen, although it is possible that some were also trained in Lemp\u00e4\u00e4l\u00e4.\nRNA never participated in battle, despite Boris Bazhanov's later claims to the contrary in his memoirs. About 35 to 40 members of it were present during a battle in in early March 1940, where they spread flyers and broadcast propaganda to encircled Soviet troops, but did not carry weapons. The men were subsequently detained by Finnish forces, who mistook them for Soviet infiltrators. After the war's end, Bazhanov was immediately asked to leave Finland, which he did. Finnish military historian presumes that most members of the RNA were executed after they were returned to the Soviet Union after the war. Additionally, Vladimir Bastamov was later extradited into the Soviet Union as one of the Leino prisoners in 1945, and was sentenced to 20 years of hard labour. He was released after Stalin's death and returned to Finland in 1956.\nFranco-British intervention plans.\nFrance had been one of the earliest supporters of Finland during the Winter War. The French saw an opportunity to weaken Germany's resource imports via a Finnish counteroffensive, as both Sweden and the Soviet Union were strategic trading partners to Germany. France had another motive, preferring to have a major war in a remote part of Europe rather than on French soil. France planned to re\u2011arm the Polish exile units and transport them to the Finnish Arctic port of Petsamo. Another proposal was a massive air strike with Turkish co-operation against the Caucasus oil fields.\nThe British, for their part, wanted to block the flow of iron ore from Swedish mines to Germany as the Swedes supplied up to 40 per cent of Germany's iron demand. The matter was raised by British Admiral Reginald Plunkett on 18 September 1939, and the next day Winston Churchill brought up the subject in the Chamberlain War Cabinet. On 11 December, Churchill opined that the British should gain a foothold in Scandinavia with the objective to help the Finns, but without a war with the Soviet Union. Because of the heavy German reliance on Northern Sweden's iron ore, Hitler had made it clear to the Swedish government in December that any Allied troops on Swedish soil would immediately provoke a German invasion.\nOn 19 December, French Prime Minister \u00c9douard Daladier introduced his plan to the General Staff and the War Cabinet. In his plan, Daladier created linkage between the war in Finland and the iron ore in Sweden. There was a danger of Finland's possible fall under Soviet hegemony. In turn, Nazi Germany could occupy both Norway and Sweden. These two powers could divide Scandinavia between them, as they had already done with Poland. The main motivation of the French and the British was to reduce German war-making ability.\nThe Military Co-ordination Committee met on 20 December in London, and two days later the French plan was put forward. The Anglo-French Supreme War Council elected to send notes to Norway and Sweden on 27 December, urging the Norwegians and Swedes to help Finland and offer the Allies their support. Norway and Sweden rejected the offer on 5 January 1940. The Allies came up with a new plan, in which they would demand that Norway and Sweden give them right of passage by citing a League of Nations resolution as justification. The expedition troops would disembark at the Norwegian port of Narvik and proceed by rail toward Finland, passing through the Swedish ore fields on the way. This demand was sent to Norway and Sweden on 6 January, but it was likewise rejected six days later.\nStymied but not yet dissuaded from the possibility of action, the Allies formulated a final plan on 29 January. First, the Finns would make a formal request for assistance. Then, the Allies would ask Norway and Sweden for permission to move the \"volunteers\" across their territory. Finally, to protect the supply line from German actions, the Allies would send units ashore at Namsos, Bergen, and Trondheim. The operation would have required 100,000 British and 35,000 French soldiers with naval and air support. The supply convoys would sail on 12 March and the landings would begin on 20 March. The end of the war on 13 March cancelled Franco-British plans to send troops to Finland through Northern Scandinavia.\nAftermath and casualties.\nResult.\nThe outcome of the Winter War is viewed differently among historians. Some view it as a Soviet victory and Finnish defeat. However, others view the war as a Soviet failure for failing to absorb Finland.\nHistorically, the Soviet invasion of Finland has been deemed one of the most embarrassing periods in Russian history and a severe failure or a \"less than convincing\" victory, while also being considered a \"botched campaign\" and the outcome hurting Soviet prestige.\nFinland.\nThe 105-day war had a profound and depressing effect in Finland. Meaningful international support was minimal and arrived late, and the German blockade had prevented most armament shipments. The 15-month period between the Winter War and Operation Barbarossa, part of which was the Continuation War, was later called the Interim Peace. After the end of the war, the situation of the Finnish Army on the Karelian Isthmus became a subject of debate in Finland. Orders had already been issued to prepare a retreat to the next line of defence in the Taipale sector. Estimates of how long the Red Army could have been delayed by retreat-and-stand operations varied from a few days to a few weeks, or to a couple of months at most.\nImmediately after the war, Helsinki officially announced 19,576 dead. According to revised estimates in 2005 by Finnish historians, 25,904 people died or went missing and 43,557 were wounded on the Finnish side during the war. Finnish and Russian researchers have estimated that there were 800\u20131,100 Finnish prisoners of war, of whom between 10 and 20 per cent died. The Soviet Union repatriated 847 Finns after the War. Air raids killed 957 civilians. Between 20 and 30 tanks were destroyed and 62 aircraft were lost. Also, Finland had to cede all ships of the Finnish Ladoga Naval Detachment to the Soviet Union by virtue of the Moscow Peace Treaty.\nDuring the Interim Peace, Finland aimed to improve its defensive capabilities and conducted negotiations with Sweden on a military alliance, but negotiations ended once it became clear that both Germany and the Soviet Union opposed such an alliance. On 31 July 1940, German Chancellor Adolf Hitler gave the order to plan an assault on the Soviet Union and so Germany had to reassess its position regarding Finland. Until then, Germany had rejected Finnish appeals to purchase arms. However, the prospect of an invasion of the Soviet Union reversed the policy. In August, the secret sale of weapons to Finland was permitted.\nKarelian evacuees established an interest group, the Finnish Karelian League, to defend Karelian rights and interests and to find a way to return ceded regions of Karelia to Finland. Finland wished to re-enter the war mainly because of the Soviet invasion of Finland during the Winter War, which had taken place after Finland had failed by relying on the League of Nations and on Nordic neutrality. Finland aimed primarily to reverse its territorial losses from the Moscow Peace Treaty and, depending on the success of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, possibly to expand its borders, especially into East Karelia. Some right-wing groups, such as the Academic Karelia Society, supported a Greater Finland ideology. The Continuation War began in June 1941 and led to Finnish participation in the Siege of Leningrad as well as the Finnish occupation of East Karelia.\nSoviet Union.\nThe Soviet General Staff Supreme Command (\"Stavka\") met in April 1940, reviewed the lessons of the Finnish campaign and recommended reforms. The role of frontline political commissars was reduced, and old-fashioned ranks and forms of discipline were reintroduced. Clothing, equipment and tactics for winter operations were improved. Not all of the reforms had been completed when Germans initiated Operation Barbarossa 14 months later.\nBetween the Winter War and \"perestroika\" in the late 1980s, Soviet historiography relied solely on Molotov's speeches on the Winter War. In his radio speech of 29 November 1939, Molotov argued that the Soviet Union had tried to negotiate guarantees of security for Leningrad for two months. The Finns had taken a hostile stance to \"please foreign imperialists\". Finland had undertaken military provocation, and the Soviet Union could no longer abide by the non-aggression pacts. According to Molotov, the Soviet Union did not want to occupy or annex Finland, but the goal was purely to secure Leningrad.\nThe official Soviet figure, with reference to the command of the Leningrad Military District, was published at a session of the Supreme Soviet on 26 March 1940, with 48,475 dead and 158,863 sick and wounded. More recent Russian estimates vary: in 1990, Mikhail Semiryaga claimed 53,522 dead, and N. I. Baryshnikov, 53,500. In 1997, Grigoriy Krivosheyev claimed 126,875 dead and missing and total casualties of 391,783, with 188,671 wounded. In 1991, Yuri Kilin claimed 63,990 dead and total casualties of 271,528. In 2007, he revised the estimate of dead to 134,000 and in 2012, he updated the estimate to 138,533. In 2013, Pavel Petrov stated that the Russian State Military Archive has a database confirming 167,976 killed or missing along with the soldiers' names, dates of birth and ranks. Nikita Khrushchev stated in his memoirs that over one million Soviet soldiers were killed.\nThere were 5,572 Soviet prisoners of war in Finland. After the Winter War, the Soviet prisoners were returned to the USSR in accordance with the Moscow Peace Treaty. Of these, 450 were released, 4,354 were sentenced to imprisonment in labour camps ranging from 3 to 10 years and 414 were exposed to be \"active in traitorous activities while in captivity\", with 334 criminal cases being transferred to the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union; 232 of those cases ended in a death penalty.\nBetween 1,200 and 3,543 Soviet tanks were destroyed. The official figure was 611 tank casualties, but Yuri Kilin found a note received by the head of the Soviet General Staff, Boris Shaposhnikov, reporting 3,543 tank casualties and 316 tanks destroyed. According to Finnish historian Ohto Manninen, the 7th Soviet Army lost 1,244 tanks during the breakthrough battles of the Mannerheim Line in mid-winter. In the immediate aftermath of the war, the Finnish estimate of the number of lost Soviet tanks was 1,000 to 1,200. The Soviet Air Forces lost around 1,000 aircraft, but fewer than half of them were combat casualties. According to Carl Fredrik Geust, based on the studies of Soviet air force units, Finnish anti-aircraft units shot down 119 and Finnish fighter pilots 131 Soviet aircraft, though all Soviet aircraft losses had been more than 900.\nGermany.\nThe Winter War was a political success for the Germans. Both the Red Army and the League of Nations were humiliated, and the Anglo-French Supreme War Council had been revealed to be chaotic and powerless. The German policy of neutrality was unpopular in the homeland, and relations with Italy had suffered. After the Moscow Peace Treaty, Germany improved its ties with Finland, and within two weeks, Finnish-German relations were at the top of the agenda. More importantly, the very poor performance of the Red Army convinced Hitler that an invasion of the Soviet Union would be successful. In June 1941, Hitler declared, \"we have only to kick in the door and the whole rotten structure will come crashing down\".\nAllies.\nThe Winter War laid bare the disorganisation and ineffectiveness of the Red Army and that of the Allies. The Anglo-French Supreme War Council was unable to formulate a workable plan, revealing its unsuitability to make effective war in either Britain or France. This failure led to the collapse of the Third Daladier Government in France and the nomination of Paul Reynaud as the new Prime Minister of France.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral and cited references.\nEnglish.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFinnish, Russian and other languages.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "33925", "revid": "47023628", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33925", "title": "William Wordsworth", "text": "English Romantic poet (1770\u20131850)\nWilliam Wordsworth (7 April 1770\u00a0\u2013 23 April 1850) was an English Romantic poet who, with Samuel Taylor Coleridge, helped to launch the Romantic Age in English literature with their joint publication \"Lyrical Ballads\" (1798).\nWordsworth's \"magnum opus\" is generally considered to be \"The Prelude\", a semi-autobiographical poem of his early years that he revised and expanded a number of times. It was posthumously titled and published by his wife in the year of his death, before which it was generally known as \"The Poem to Coleridge\".\nWordsworth was Poet Laureate from 1843 until his death from pleurisy on 23 April 1850. He remains one of the most recognizable names in English poetry and was a key figure of the Romantic poets.\nEarly life.\nFamily and education.\nThe second of five children born to John Wordsworth and Ann Cookson, William Wordsworth was born on 7 April 1770 in what is now named Wordsworth House in Cockermouth, Cumberland (now in Cumbria), part of the scenic region in northwestern England known as the Lake District. William's sister, the poet and diarist Dorothy Wordsworth, to whom he was close all his life, was born the following year, and the two were baptised together. They had three other siblings: Richard, the eldest, who became a lawyer; John Wordsworth, born after Dorothy, who went to sea and died in 1805 when the ship of which he was captain, the \"Earl of Abergavenny\", was wrecked off the south coast of England; and Christopher, the youngest, who entered the Church and rose to be Master of Trinity College, Cambridge.\nWordsworth's father was a legal representative of James Lowther, 1st Earl of Lonsdale and, through his connections, lived in a large mansion in the small town. He was frequently away from home on business, so the young William and his siblings had little involvement with him and remained distant until he died in 1783. However, he did encourage William in his reading, and in particular, set him to commit large portions of verse to memory, including works by Milton, Shakespeare and Spenser which William would pore over in his father's library. William also spent time at his mother's parents' house in Penrith, Cumberland, where he was exposed to the moors but did not get along with his grandparents or uncle, who also lived there. His hostile interactions with them distressed him to the point of contemplating suicide.\nWordsworth was taught to read by his mother, and he first attended a tiny school of low quality in Cockermouth, then a school in Penrith for the children of upper-class families. He was taught there by Ann Birkett, who instilled in her students traditions that included pursuing scholarly and local activities, especially the festivals around Easter, May Day and Shrove Tuesday. Wordsworth was taught both the Bible and the \"Spectator\", but little else. At the school in Penrith, he met the Hutchinsons, including Mary Hutchinson, who later became his wife.\nAfter the death of Wordsworth's mother, in 1778, his father sent him to Hawkshead Grammar School in Lancashire (now in Cumbria) and sent Dorothy to live with relatives in Yorkshire. She and William did not meet again for nine years.\nWordsworth debuted as a writer in 1787 when he published a sonnet in \"The European Magazine\". That same year he began attending St John's College, Cambridge. He received his BA degree in 1791. He returned to Hawkshead for the first two summers of his time at Cambridge and often spent later holidays on walking tours, visiting places famous for the beauty of their landscape. In 1790, he went on a walking tour of Europe, during which he toured the Alps extensively and visited nearby areas of France, Switzerland, and Italy.\nRelationship with Annette Vallon.\nIn November 1791, Wordsworth visited Revolutionary France and became enchanted with the Republican movement. He fell in love with a French woman, Annette Vallon, the daughter of a French Royalist, who, in 1792, gave birth to their daughter Caroline. Financial problems and Britain's tense relations with France forced him to return to England alone the following year. The circumstances of his return and subsequent behaviour raised doubts about his declared wish to marry Annette. However, he supported her and his daughter as best he could in later life. The Reign of Terror left Wordsworth thoroughly disillusioned with the French Revolution, and in December 1792 or January 1793 his family discontinued the allowance he had been living on and recalled him to England.\nWith the Peace of Amiens again allowing travel to France, in 1802, Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy visited Annette and Caroline in Calais. The purpose of the visit was to prepare Annette for the fact of his forthcoming marriage to Mary Hutchinson. Afterwards, he wrote the sonnet \"It is a beauteous evening, calm and free\", recalling a seaside walk with the nine-year-old Caroline, whom he had never seen before that visit. Mary was anxious that Wordsworth should do more for Caroline. Upon Caroline's marriage, in 1816, Wordsworth settled \u00a330 a year on her (equivalent to \u00a3 in 2021), payments which continued until 1835, when they were replaced by a capital settlement.\nEarly career.\nFirst publication and \"Lyrical Ballads\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;poem&gt;\nWe Are Seven\nI met a little cottage girl:\n She was eight years old, she said;\nHer hair was thick with many a curl\n That clustered round her head.\nShe had a rustic, woodland air,\n And she was wildly clad;\nHer eyes were fair, and very fair; - \n Her beauty made me glad.\n\u201cSisters and brothers, little maid,\n How many may you be?\u201d\n\u201cHow many?

In 1795, he received a legacy of \u00a3900 from Raisley Calvert and was able to pursue a career as a poet.\nIt was also in 1795 that he met Samuel Taylor Coleridge in Somerset. The two poets quickly developed a close friendship. For two years from 1795, William and his sister Dorothy lived at Racedown House in Dorset\u2014a property of the Pinney family\u2014to the west of Pilsdon Pen. They walked in the area for about two hours daily, and the nearby hills consoled Dorothy as she pined for the fells of her native Lakeland. She wrote,\n\"We have hills which, seen from a distance, almost take the character of mountains, some cultivated nearly to their summits, others in their wild state covered with furze and broom. These delight me the most as they remind me of our native wilds.\"\nIn 1797, the pair moved to Alfoxton House, Somerset, just a few miles away from Coleridge's home in Nether Stowey. Together Wordsworth and Coleridge (with insights from Dorothy) produced \"Lyrical Ballads\" (1798), an important work in the English Romantic movement. The volume gave neither Wordsworth's nor Coleridge's name as author. One of Wordsworth's most famous poems, \"Tintern Abbey\", was published in this collection, along with Coleridge's \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\". The second edition, published in 1800, had only Wordsworth listed as the author and included a preface to the poems. It was augmented significantly in the next edition, published in 1802. In this preface, which some scholars consider a central work of Romantic literary theory, Wordsworth discusses what he sees as the elements of a new type of verse, one that is based on the ordinary language \"really used by men\" while avoiding the poetic diction of much 18th-century verse. Wordsworth also gives his famous definition of poetry as \"the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings: it takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquility\", and calls his own poems in the book \"experimental\". A fourth and final edition of \"Lyrical Ballads\" was published in 1805.\n\"The Borderers\".\nBetween 1795 and 1797, Wordsworth wrote his only play, \"The Borderers\", a verse tragedy set during the reign of King Henry III of England, when Englishmen in the North Country came into conflict with Scottish border reivers. He attempted to get the play staged in November 1797. However, it was rejected by Thomas Harris, the manager of the Covent Garden Theatre, who proclaimed it \"impossible that the play should succeed in the representation\". The rebuff was not received lightly by Wordsworth, and the play was not published until 1842, after substantial revisions.\nGermany and move to the Lake District.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;poem&gt;\nI travelled among unknown men\nI travelled among unknown men,\n In lands beyond the sea;\nNor, England! did I know till then\n What love I bore to thee.\n'T is past, that melancholy dream!\n Nor will I quit thy shore\nA second time, for still I seem\n To love thee more and more.\nAmong thy mountains did I feel\n The joy of my desire;\nAnd she I cherished turned her wheel\n Beside an English fire.\nThy mornings showed, thy nights concealed,\n The bowers where Lucy played;\nAnd thine too is the last green field\n That Lucy's eyes surveyed.&lt;/poem&gt;\nWordsworth, Dorothy, and Coleridge travelled to Germany in the autumn of 1798. While Coleridge was intellectually stimulated by the journey, its main effect on Wordsworth was to produce homesickness. During the harsh winter of 1798\u201399, Wordsworth lived with Dorothy in Goslar, and, despite extreme stress and loneliness, began work on the autobiographical piece that was later titled \"The Prelude\". He wrote several other famous poems in Goslar, including \"The Lucy poems\". In the Autumn of 1799, Wordsworth and his sister returned to England and visited the Hutchinson family at Sockburn. When Coleridge arrived back in England, he travelled to the North with their publisher, Joseph Cottle, to meet Wordsworth and undertake a proposed tour of the Lake District. This was the immediate cause of the brother and sister's settling at Dove Cottage in Grasmere in the Lake District, this time with another poet, Robert Southey, nearby. Wordsworth, Coleridge and Southey came to be known as the \"Lake Poets\". Throughout this period, many of Wordsworth's poems revolved around themes of death, endurance, separation and grief.\nMarried life.\nIn 1802, Lowther's heir, William Lowther, 1st Earl of Lonsdale, paid the \u00a34,000 () owed to Wordsworth's father through Lowther's failure to pay his aide. It was this repayment that afforded Wordsworth the financial means to marry. On 4 October, following his visit with Dorothy to France to arrange matters with Annette, Wordsworth married his childhood friend, Mary Hutchinson, at All Saints' Church, Brompton. Dorothy continued to live with the couple and grew close to Mary. The following year, Mary gave birth to the first of five children, three of whom predeceased her and William:\nLater career.\nAutobiographical work and \"Poems, in Two Volumes\".\nWordsworth had for years been making plans to write a long philosophical poem in three parts, which he intended to call \"The Recluse\". In 1798\u201399 he started an autobiographical poem, which he referred to as the \"poem to Coleridge\" and which he planned would serve as an appendix to a larger work called \"The Recluse\". In 1804, he began expanding this autobiographical work, having decided to make it a prologue rather than an appendix. He completed this work, now generally referred to as the first version of \"The Prelude\", in 1805, but refused to publish such a personal work until he had completed the whole of \"The Recluse\". The death of his brother John, also in 1805, affected him strongly and may have influenced his decisions about these works.\nWordsworth's philosophical allegiances, as articulated in \"The Prelude\" and in such shorter works as \"Lines written a few miles above Tintern Abbey\" have been a source of critical debate. It was long supposed that Wordsworth relied chiefly on Coleridge for philosophical guidance. However, scholars have recently suggested that Wordsworth's ideas may have been formed years before he and Coleridge became friends in the mid-1790s. In particular, while he was in revolutionary Paris in 1792, the 22-year-old Wordsworth met the mysterious traveller John \"Walking\" Stewart (1747\u20131822), who was nearing the end of his thirty years of wandering, on foot, from Madras, India, through Persia and Arabia, across Africa and Europe, and up through the fledgling United States. By the time of their association, Stewart had published an ambitious work of original materialist philosophy entitled \"The Apocalypse of Nature\" (London, 1791), to which many of Wordsworth's philosophical sentiments may well be indebted.\nIn 1807, Wordsworth published \"Poems, in Two Volumes\", including \"\". Until now, Wordsworth was known only for \"Lyrical Ballads\", and he hoped this new collection would cement his reputation. Its reception was lukewarm.\nIn 1810, Wordsworth and Coleridge were estranged over the latter's opium addiction, and in 1812, his son Thomas died at the age of 6, six months after the death of 3-year-old Catherine. The following year, he received an appointment as Distributor of Stamps for Westmorland, and the stipend of \u00a3400 a year made him financially secure, albeit at the cost of political independence. In 1813, he and his family, including Dorothy, moved to Rydal Mount, Ambleside (between Grasmere and Rydal Water), where he spent the rest of his life.\nThe Prospectus.\nIn 1814, Wordsworth published \"The Excursion\" as the second part of the three-part work \"The Recluse\" even though he never completed the first or third parts. He did, however, write a poetic Prospectus to \"The Recluse\" in which he laid out the structure and intention of the whole work. The Prospectus contains some of Wordsworth's most famous lines on the relation between the human mind and nature:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\n ... my voice proclaims\nHow exquisitely the individual Mind\n(And the progressive powers perhaps no less\nOf the whole species) to the external World\nIs fitted:\u2014and how exquisitely, too\u2014\nTheme this but little heard of among Men,\nThe external World is fitted to the Mind;\nAnd the creation (by no lower name\nCan it be called) which they with blended might\nAccomplish ...&lt;/poem&gt;\nSome modern critics suggest that there was a decline in his work beginning around the mid-1810s, perhaps because most of the concerns that characterised his early poems (loss, death, endurance, separation and abandonment) had been resolved in his writings and his life. By 1820, he was enjoying considerable success accompanying a reversal in the contemporary critical opinion of his earlier works.\nThe poet and artist William Blake, who knew Wordsworth's work, was struck by Wordsworth's boldness in centring his poetry on the human mind. In response to Wordsworth's poetic programme that, \u201cwhen we look / Into our Minds, into the Mind of Man\u2013 / My haunt, and the main region of my song\u201d (\"The Excursion\"), William Blake wrote to his friend Henry Crabb Robinson that the passage \" caused him a bowel complaint which nearly killed him\u201d.\nFollowing the death of his friend, the painter William Green in 1823, Wordsworth also mended his relations with Coleridge. The two were fully reconciled by 1828 when they toured the Rhineland together. Dorothy suffered from a severe illness in 1829 and she remained ill for the remainder of her life. Coleridge and Charles Lamb both died in 1834, their loss being a difficult blow to Wordsworth. The following year saw the passing of James Hogg. Despite the death of many contemporaries, the popularity of his poetry ensured a steady stream of young friends and admirers to replace those he lost.\nReligious and philosophical beliefs.\nWordsworth's youthful political radicalism, unlike Coleridge's, never led him to rebel against his religious upbringing. He remarked in 1812 that he was willing to shed his blood for the established Church of England, reflected in his \"Ecclesiastical Sketches\" of 1822. This religious conservatism also colours \"The Excursion\" (1814), a long poem that became extremely popular during the nineteenth century. It features three central characters: the Wanderer, who \"loved to pace the public roads\", the Solitary, who has experienced the hopes and miseries of the French Revolution, and the Pastor, who dominates the last third of the poem.\nWordsworth's poetic philosophy.\nBehler has pointed out the fact that Wordsworth wanted to invoke the basic feeling that a human heart possesses and expresses. He had reversed the philosophical standpoint expressed by his friend S. T. Coleridge, of 'creating the characters in such an environment so that the public feels them belonging to the distant place and time'. And this philosophical realisation by Wordsworth indeed allowed him to choose the language and structural patterning of the poetry that a common person used every day. Kurland wrote that the conversational aspect of a language emerges through social necessity. Social necessity posits the theme of possessing the proper knowledge, interest and biases also among the speakers. William Wordsworth has used conversation in his poetry to let the poet 'I' merge into 'We'. The poem \"Farewell\" exposes the identical emotion that the poet and his sister nourish:\n\"We leave you here in solitude to dwell/ With these our latest gifts of tender thought; \nThou, like the morning, in thy saffron coat,/ Bright gowan, and marsh-marigold, farewell!\" (L. 19\u201322). \nThis kind of conversational tone persists throughout the poet's poetic journey, which positions him as a man in society who speaks to the purpose of communion with the very common mass of that society. Again; \"Preface to Lyrical Ballads\" is the evidence where the poet expresses why he is writing and what he is writing and what purpose it will serve humanity.\nLaureateship and other honours.\nWordsworth remained a formidable presence in his later years. In 1837, the Scottish poet and playwright Joanna Baillie reflected on her long acquaintance with Wordsworth. \"He looks like a man that one must not speak to unless one has some sensible thing to say. However, he does occasionally converse cheerfully &amp; well, and when one knows how benevolent &amp; excellent he is, it disposes one to be very much pleased with him.\"\nIn 1838, Wordsworth received an honorary doctorate in Civil Law from the University of Durham. The following year he was awarded the same honorary degree by the University of Oxford, when John Keble praised him as the \"poet of humanity\", praise greatly appreciated by Wordsworth. (It has been argued that Wordsworth was a significant influence on Keble's immensely popular book of devotional poetry, \"The Christian Year\" (1827).) In 1842, the government awarded him a Civil List pension of \u00a3300 a year.\nFollowing the death of Robert Southey in 1843, Wordsworth became Poet Laureate. He initially refused the honour, saying that he was too old, but accepted when the Prime Minister, Robert Peel, assured him that \"you shall have nothing required of you\". Wordsworth thus became the only poet laureate to write no official verses. The sudden death of his daughter Dora in 1847 at age 42 was difficult for the ageing poet to take, and in his depression, he ultimately gave up writing new material.\nDeath.\nWilliam Wordsworth died at home at Rydal Mount from an aggravated case of pleurisy on 23 April 1850, and was buried at St Oswald's Church, Grasmere. His widow, Mary, published his lengthy autobiographical \"Poem to Coleridge\" as \"The Prelude\" several months after his death. Though it failed to interest people at the time, it has since come to be widely recognised as his masterpiece.\nIn popular culture.\nKen Russell's 1978 film \"William and Dorothy\" portrays the relationship between William and his sister Dorothy.\nWordsworth and Coleridge's friendship is examined by Julien Temple in his 2000 film \"Pandaemonium\".\nWordsworth has appeared as a character in works of fiction, including:\nIsaac Asimov's 1966 novelisation of the 1966 film \"Fantastic Voyage\" sees Dr. Peter Duval quoting Wordsworth's \"The Prelude\" as the miniaturised submarine sails through the cerebral fluid surrounding a human brain, comparing it to the \"strange seas of thought\".\nTaylor Swift's 2020 album \"Folklore\" alludes to Wordsworth in her bonus track \"The Lakes\", which is thought to be about the Lake District.\nCommemoration.\nIn April 2020, the Royal Mail issued a series of postage stamps to mark the 250th anniversary of the birth of Wordsworth. Ten 1st class stamps were issued featuring Wordsworth and all the major British poets of the Romantic era: William Blake, John Keats, Lord Byron, John Clare, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Mary Robinson, Letitia Elizabeth Landon, Percy Bysshe Shelley and Walter Scott. Each stamp included an extract from one of their most popular and enduring works, with Wordsworth's \"The Rainbow\" selected for the poet.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The musical explores the rivalry between the Jets and the Sharks, two teenage street gangs of different ethnic backgrounds. The Sharks, who are recent migrants from Puerto Rico, and the Jets, who are white, vie for dominance of the neighborhood, and the police try to keep order. The young protagonist, Tony, a former member of the Jets and best friend of the gang's leader, Riff, falls in love with Maria, the sister of Bernardo, the leader of the Sharks. The dark theme, sophisticated music, extended dance scenes, tragic love story, and focus on social problems marked a turning point in musical theatre.\nThe original 1957 Broadway production, directed and choreographed by Robbins, marked Sondheim's Broadway debut. It ran for 732 performances before going on tour. The production was nominated for six Tony Awards, including Best Musical, in 1958, winning two. The show had an even longer-running West End production, a number of revivals, and international productions. A 1961 musical film adaptation, co-directed by Robert Wise and Robbins, was nominated for eleven Academy Awards and won ten, including Best Picture. A 2021 film adaptation, directed by Steven Spielberg was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, along with six additional nominations, winning for Best Supporting Actress.\nBackground.\nGenesis.\nIn 1949, Jerome Robbins approached Leonard Bernstein and Arthur Laurents about collaborating on a contemporary musical adaptation of \"Romeo and Juliet\". He proposed that the plot focus on the conflict between a Catholic family and a Jewish family living on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, during the Easter\u2013Passover season; the girl has survived the Holocaust and emigrated from Israel. The conflict was to be centered on antisemitism of the Catholic \"Jets\" towards the Jewish \"Emeralds\". Eager to write his first musical, Laurents immediately agreed. Bernstein wanted to present the material in operatic form, but Robbins and Laurents resisted the suggestion. They described the project as \"lyric theater\", and Laurents wrote a first draft he called \"East Side Story\". Only after he completed it did the group realize it was little more than a musicalization of themes that had already been covered in plays like \"Abie's Irish Rose\". When Robbins opted to drop out, the three men went their separate ways, and the piece was shelved for almost five years.\nIn 1955, theatrical producer Martin Gabel was working on a stage adaptation of the James M. Cain novel \"Serenade\", about an opera singer who comes to the realization he is homosexual, and he invited Laurents to write the book. Laurents accepted and suggested Bernstein and Robbins join the creative team. Robbins felt that if the three were going to join forces, they should return to \"East Side Story\", and Bernstein agreed. Laurents, however, was committed to Gabel, who introduced him to the young composer/lyricist Stephen Sondheim. Sondheim auditioned by playing the score for \"Saturday Night\", his musical that was scheduled to open in the fall. Laurents liked the lyrics but was not impressed with the music. Sondheim did not care for Laurents' opinion. \"Serenade\" ultimately was shelved.\nLaurents was soon hired to write the screenplay for a remake of the 1934 Greta Garbo film \"The Painted Veil\" for Ava Gardner. While in Hollywood, he contacted Bernstein, who was in town conducting at the Hollywood Bowl. The two met at The Beverly Hills Hotel, and the conversation turned to juvenile delinquent gangs, a fairly recent social phenomenon that had received major coverage on the front pages of the morning newspapers due to a Chicano turf war. Bernstein suggested they rework \"East Side Story\" and set it in Los Angeles, but Laurents felt he was more familiar with Puerto Ricans in the United States and Harlem than he was with Mexican Americans and Olvera Street. The two contacted Robbins, who was enthusiastic about a musical with a Latin beat. He arrived in Hollywood to choreograph the dance sequences for the 1956 film \"The King and I\", and he and Laurents began developing the musical while working on their respective projects, keeping in touch with Bernstein, who had returned to New York. When the producer of \"The Painted Veil\" replaced Gardner with Eleanor Parker and asked Laurents to revise his script with her in mind, he backed out of the film, freeing him to devote all his time to the stage musical. Bernstein and Laurents, who had been blacklisted for alleged communist activities, worked with Robbins even though he had cooperated with the House Un-American Activities Committee.\nCollaboration and development.\nIn New York City, Laurents went to the opening night party for a new play by Ugo Betti. There he met Sondheim, who had heard that \"East Side Story\", now retitled \"West Side Story\", was back on track. Bernstein had decided he needed to concentrate solely on the music, and he and Robbins had invited Betty Comden and Adolph Green to write the lyrics, but the team opted to work on \"Peter Pan\" instead. Laurents asked Sondheim if he would be interested in tackling the task. Initially he resisted, because he was determined to write the full score for his next project (\"Saturday Night\" had been scrapped). But Oscar Hammerstein convinced him that he would benefit from the experience, and he accepted. Meanwhile, Laurents had written a new draft of the book changing the characters' backgrounds: the male lead, once an Irish American, was now of Polish and Irish descent, and the formerly Jewish female lead had become Puerto Rican.\nThe original book Laurents wrote closely adhered to \"Romeo and Juliet\", but the characters based on Shakespeare's Rosaline and the parents of the doomed lovers were eliminated early on. Later the scenes related to Juliet's faking her death and committing suicide also were deleted. Language posed a problem; profanity was uncommon in the theater at the time, and slang expressions were avoided for fear they would be dated by the time the production opened. Laurents ultimately invented what sounded like real street talk but actually was not: \"cut the frabba-jabba\", for example. Sondheim converted long passages of dialogue, and sometimes just a simple phrase like \"A boy like that would kill your brother\", into lyrics. With the help of Oscar Hammerstein, Laurents convinced Bernstein and Sondheim to move \"One Hand, One Heart\", which he considered too pristine for the balcony scene, to the scene set in the bridal shop, and as a result \"Tonight\" was written to replace it. Laurents felt that the building tension needed to be alleviated in order to increase the impact of the play's tragic outcome, so comic relief in the form of Officer Krupke was added to the second act. He was outvoted on other issues: he felt the lyrics to \"America\" and \"I Feel Pretty\" were too witty for the characters singing them, but they stayed in the score and proved to be audience favorites. Another song, \"Kid Stuff\", was added and quickly removed during the Washington, D.C., tryout when Laurents convinced the others it was helping tip the balance of the show into typical musical comedy.\nBernstein composed \"West Side Story\" and \"Candide\" concurrently, which led to some switches of material between the two works. Tony and Maria's duet, \"One Hand, One Heart\", was originally intended for Cunegonde in \"Candide\". The music of \"Gee, Officer Krupke\" was pulled from the Venice scene in \"Candide\". Laurents explained the style that the creative team finally decided on:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Just as Tony and Maria, our Romeo and Juliet, set themselves apart from the other kids by their love, so we have tried to set them even further apart by their language, their songs, their movement. Wherever possible in the show, we have tried to heighten emotion or to articulate inarticulate adolescence through music, song or dance.\nThe show was nearly complete in the fall of 1956, but almost everyone on the creative team needed to fulfill other commitments first. Robbins was involved with \"Bells Are Ringing\", then Bernstein with \"Candide\", and in January 1957 \"A Clearing in the Woods\", Laurents' latest play, opened and quickly closed. When a backers' audition failed to raise any money for \"West Side Story\" late in the spring of 1957, only two months before the show was to begin rehearsals, producer Cheryl Crawford pulled out of the project. Every other producer had already turned down the show, deeming it too dark and depressing. Bernstein was despondent, but Sondheim convinced his friend Hal Prince, who was in Boston overseeing the out-of-town tryout of the new George Abbott musical \"New Girl in Town\", to read the script. He liked it but decided to ask Abbott, his longtime mentor, for his opinion, and Abbott advised him to turn it down. Prince, aware that Abbott was the primary reason \"New Girl\" was in trouble, decided to ignore him, and he and his producing partner Robert E. Griffith flew to New York to hear the score. In his memoirs, Prince recalled: \"Sondheim and Bernstein sat at the piano playing through the music, and soon I was singing along with them\".\nProduction period.\nPrince began cutting the budget and raising money. Robbins then announced he did not want to choreograph the show, but changed his mind when Prince agreed to an eight-week dance rehearsal period (instead of the customary four), since there was to be more dancing in \"West Side Story\" than in any previous Broadway show, and allowed Robbins to hire Peter Gennaro as his assistant. Originally, when considering the cast, Laurents wanted James Dean for the lead role of Tony, but the actor soon died. Sondheim found Larry Kert and Chita Rivera, who created the roles of Tony and Anita, respectively. Getting the work on stage was still not easy. Bernstein said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Everyone told us that [\"West Side Story\"] was an impossible project ... And we were told no one was going to be able to sing augmented fourths, as with \"Ma-ri-a\" ... Also, they said the score was too rangy for pop music ... Besides, who wanted to see a show in which the first-act curtain comes down on two dead bodies lying on the stage?... And then we had the really tough problem of casting it, because the characters had to be able not only to sing but dance and act and be taken for teenagers. Ultimately, some of the cast were teenagers, some were 21, some were 30 but looked 16. Some were wonderful singers but couldn't dance very well, or vice versa ... and if they could do both, they couldn't act.\nThroughout the rehearsal period, the New York newspapers were filled with articles about gang warfare, keeping the show's plot timely. Robbins kept the cast members playing the Sharks and the Jets separate to discourage them from socializing with each other and reminded everyone of the reality of gang violence by posting news stories on the bulletin board backstage. Robbins wanted a gritty realism from his sneaker- and jeans-clad cast. He gave the ensemble more freedom than Broadway dancers had previously been given to interpret their roles, and the dancers were thrilled to be treated like actors instead of just choreographed bodies. Robbins gave each dancer a unique gesture repertoire specific to their character. As the rehearsals wore on, Bernstein fought to keep his score together, as other members of the team called on him to cut out more and more of the sweeping or complex \"operatic\" passages. Columbia Records initially declined to record the cast album, saying the score was too depressing and too difficult.\nThere were problems with Oliver Smith's designs. His painted backdrops were stunning, but the sets were, for the most part, either shabby looking or too stylized. Prince refused to spend money on new construction, and Smith was obliged to improve what he had as best he could with very little money to do it. The pre-Broadway run in Washington, D.C., was a critical and commercial success, although none of the reviews mentioned Sondheim, listed as co-lyricist, who was overshadowed by the better-known Bernstein. Bernstein magnanimously removed his name as co-author of the lyrics, although Sondheim was uncertain he wanted to receive sole credit for what he considered to be overly florid contributions by Bernstein. Robbins demanded and received a \"Conceived by\" credit, and used it to justify his making major decisions regarding changes in the show without consulting the others. As a result, by opening night on Broadway, none of his collaborators were talking to him.\nIt was rumored that while Bernstein was away trying to fix the musical \"Candide\", Sondheim wrote some of the music for \"West Side Story\", and that Bernstein's co-lyricist billing disappeared from the credits of \"West Side Story\" during the tryout as a trade-off. However, Steven Suskin writes in his book \"Show Tunes\" that \"as the writing progressed and the extent of Bernstein's lyric contributions became less, the composer agreed to rescind his credit. ... Contrary to rumor, Sondheim did not write music for the show; his only contribution came on 'Something's Coming'\", where he developed the main strain of the chorus from music Bernstein wrote for the verse.\nSynopsis.\nAct 1.\nTwo rival teenage gangs, the Jets (white Americans) and the Sharks (Puerto Ricans), struggle for control of the San Juan Hill neighborhood on the Upper West Side of Manhattan (Prologue). Police officers Krupke and Lt. Schrank warn them to stop fighting on their beat. The police chase the Sharks off, and then the Jets plan how they can assure their continued dominance of the street. The Jets' leader, Riff, suggests setting up a rumble with the Sharks. He plans to make the challenge to Bernardo, the Sharks' leader, that night at the neighborhood dance. Riff wants to convince his best friend and former member of the Jets, Tony, to meet the Jets at the dance. Some of the Jets are unsure of his loyalty, but Riff is adamant that Tony is still one of them (\"Jet Song\"). Riff meets Tony while he's working at Doc's Drugstore to persuade him to come. Tony initially refuses, but Riff wins him over. Tony is convinced that something important is round the corner (\"Something's Coming\").\nMaria works in a bridal shop with Anita, the girlfriend of her brother, Bernardo. Maria has just arrived from Puerto Rico for her arranged marriage to Chino, a friend of Bernardo's. Maria confesses to Anita that she is not in love with Chino. Anita makes Maria a dress to wear to the neighborhood dance.\nAt the dance, after introductions, the teenagers begin to dance; soon a challenge dance is called (\"Dance at the Gym\"), during which Tony and Maria (who aren't taking part in the challenge dance) see each other across the room and are drawn to each other. They dance together, forgetting the tension in the room, and fall in love. Bernardo pulls his sister from Tony and sends her home. Riff and Bernardo agree to meet for a War Council at Doc's, a drug store which is considered neutral ground, but meanwhile, an infatuated and happy Tony finds Maria's building and serenades her outside her bedroom (\"Maria\"). She appears on her fire escape, and the two profess their love for one another (\"Tonight\"). Meanwhile, Anita, Rosalia, and the other Shark girls discuss the differences between the territory of Puerto Rico and the mainland United States of America, with Anita defending America, and Rosalia yearning for Puerto Rico (\"America\").\nThe Jets get antsy while waiting for the Sharks inside Doc's drugstore. Riff helps them let out their aggression (\"Cool\"). The Sharks arrive to discuss weapons to use in the rumble. Tony suggests \"a fair fight\" (fists only), which the leaders agree to, despite the other members' protests. Bernardo believes that he will fight Tony, but must settle for fighting Diesel, Riff's second-in-command, instead. This is followed by a monologue by the ineffective Lt. Schrank trying to find out the location of the rumble. Tony tells Doc about Maria. Doc is worried for them while Tony is convinced that nothing can go wrong; he is in love.\nThe next day, Maria is in a very happy mood at the bridal shop, as she anticipates seeing Tony again, but she is dismayed when she learns about the upcoming rumble from Anita. When Tony arrives, Maria insists that he must stop the fight altogether, which he agrees to do. Before he goes, they dream of their wedding (\"One Hand, One Heart\"). Tony, Maria, Anita, Bernardo and the Sharks, and Riff and the Jets all anticipate the events to come that night (\"Tonight Quintet\"). The gangs meet under the highway and, as the fight between Bernardo and Diesel begins, Tony arrives and tries to stop it. Though Bernardo taunts and provokes Tony, ridiculing his attempt to make peace, Tony keeps his composure. When Bernardo pushes Tony, Riff punches him in Tony's defense. The two draw their switchblades and get in a fight (\"The Rumble\"). Tony attempts to intervene, inadvertently leading to Riff being fatally stabbed by Bernardo. Tony kills Bernardo in a fit of rage, which in turn provokes an all-out fight like the fight in the Prologue. The sound of approaching police sirens is heard, and everyone scatters, except Tony, who stands in shock at what he has done. The tomboy Anybodys, who stubbornly wishes that she could become a Jet, tells Tony to flee from the scene at the last moment and leaves with the knives. Only the bodies of Riff and Bernardo remain.\nAct 2.\nBlissfully unaware that the rumble has taken place with fatal consequences, Maria giddily sings to her friends Rosalia, Teresita, and Francisca that she is in love (\"I Feel Pretty\"). Chino brings the news that Tony has killed Bernardo, then leaves. Maria prays that what he has told her is a lie. Tony arrives to see Maria and she initially pounds on his chest with rage, but she still loves him. They plan to run away together. As the walls of Maria's bedroom disappear, they find themselves in a dreamlike world of peace (\"Somewhere\").\nTwo of the Jets, A-Rab and Baby John, are set on by Officer Krupke, but they manage to escape him. They meet the rest of the gang. To cheer themselves up, they lampoon Krupke and the other adults who don't understand them (\"Gee, Officer Krupke\"). Anybodys arrives and tells the Jets that she has been spying on the Puerto Ricans; she has discovered that Chino has a gun and is looking for Tony. The gang separates to find Tony and protect him. Action has taken charge; he accepts Anybodys into the Jets and includes her in the search.\nA grieving Anita arrives at Maria's apartment. As Tony leaves, he tells Maria to meet him at Doc's so they can run away to the country. In spite of her attempts to conceal it, Anita sees that Tony has been with Maria, and launches an angry tirade against him (\"A Boy Like That\"). Maria counters by telling Anita how powerful love is (\"I Have a Love\"), and Anita realizes that Maria loves Tony as much as she had loved Bernardo. She admits that Chino has a gun and is looking for Tony. Lt. Schrank arrives to question Maria about her brother's death, and Anita agrees to go to Doc's to warn Tony that Maria will be late. Unfortunately, the Jets, who have found Tony, have congregated at Doc's, and they taunt Anita with racist slurs and eventually attempt rape. Doc arrives and stops them. Furious, Anita spitefully delivers the wrong message, telling the Jets that Chino has shot Maria dead.\nDoc relates the news to Tony, who has been dreaming of heading to the countryside to have children with Maria. Feeling there is no longer anything to live for, Tony leaves to find Chino, begging for him to shoot him as well. Just as Tony sees Maria alive, Chino arrives and shoots Tony. The Jets, Sharks, and adults flock around the lovers. Maria holds Tony in her arms (and sings a quiet, brief reprise of \"Somewhere\") as he dies. Angry at the death of another friend, the Jets move towards the Sharks but Maria takes Chino's gun and tells everyone that \"all of [them]\" killed Tony and the others because of their hate for each other, and, \"Now I can kill too, because now I have hate!\" she yells. However, she is unable to bring herself to fire the gun and drops it, crying in grief. Gradually, all the members of both gangs assemble on either side of Tony's body, showing that the feud is over. As Krupke takes a remorseful Chino into custody, the Jets and Sharks form a procession, and together carry Tony away, with Maria the last one in the procession.\nCharacters.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMusical numbers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes\nProductions.\nOriginal Broadway production.\nAfter tryouts in Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia beginning in August 1957, the original Broadway production opened at the Winter Garden Theatre on September 26, to positive reviews. The production was directed and choreographed by Jerome Robbins, orchestrated by Sid Ramin and Irwin Kostal, and produced by Robert E. Griffith and Harold Prince, with lighting designed by Jean Rosenthal. The cast starred Larry Kert as Tony, Carol Lawrence as Maria, Chita Rivera as Anita and David Winters as Baby John. The other notable cast members in the original production were: Riff: Michael Callan, A-Rab: Tony Mordente, Big Deal: Martin Charnin, Gee-Tar: Tommy Abbott, Chino: Jamie Sanchez, Rosalia: Marilyn Cooper, Consuela [\"sic\"]: Reri Grist, Doc: Art Smith and Francisca: Elizabeth Taylor. The production closed on June 27, 1959, after 732 performances. Robbins won the Tony Award for Best Choreographer, and Oliver Smith won the Tony for Best Scenic Designer. Also nominated were Carol Lawrence as Best Actress in a Supporting Role in a Musical, Max Goberman as Best Musical Director and Conductor, and Irene Sharaff for Best Costume Design. Carol Lawrence received the 1958 Theatre World Award.\nThe production's national tour was launched on July 1, 1959, in Denver and then played in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Detroit, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Baltimore, Philadelphia, and Boston. It returned to the Winter Garden Theater in New York in April 1960 for another 249 performance engagement, closing in December.\nUK productions.\nA 1958 production at the Manchester Opera House transferred to London, where it opened at Her Majesty's Theatre in the West End on December 12, and ran until June 1961 with a total of 1,039 performances. Robbins directed and choreographed, and it was co-choreographed by Peter Gennaro, with scenery by Oliver Smith. Featured performers were George Chakiris, who won an Academy Award as Bernardo in the 1961 film version, as Riff, Marlys Watters as Maria, Don McKay as Tony, and Chita Rivera reprising her Broadway role as Anita. David Holliday, who had been playing Gladhand since the London opening, took over as Tony.\nThe refurbished Shaftesbury Theatre reopened with a run of \"West Side Story\" from December 19, 1974, to mid-1975. It was directed by Bill Kenwright, choreographed by Roger Finch, and starred Lionel Morton as Tony and Christiana Matthews as Maria. A London production originated at Leicester Haymarket Theatre in early 1984 and transferred on May 16, to Her Majesty's Theatre. It closed on September 28, 1985. The 1980 Broadway production was recreated by Tom Abbott. The cast starred Steven Pacey as Tony and Jan Hartley as Maria. Maxine Gordon was Anybodys.\nA UK national tour started in 1997 and starred David Habbin as Tony, Katie Knight Adams as Maria and Anna-Jane Casey as Anita. The production transferred to London's West End opening at the Prince Edward Theatre in October 1998, transferring to the Prince of Wales Theatre where it closed in January 2000. The production subsequently toured the UK for a second time.\nA production at the Curve Theatre, starring Jamie Muscato as Tony and Adriana Ivelisse as Maria, ran from November 23, 2019, to January 11, 2020.\n1980 Broadway revival.\nA Broadway revival opened at the Minskoff Theatre on February 14, 1980, and closed on November 30, after 333 performances. It was directed and choreographed by Robbins, with the book scenes co-directed by Gerald Freedman; produced by Gladys Nederlander and Tom Abbott; Lee Theodore assisted in the choreography reproduction. The original scenic, lighting, and costume designs were used. It starred Ken Marshall as Tony, Josie de Guzman as Maria and Debbie Allen as Anita. Both de Guzman and Allen received Tony Award nominations as Best Featured Actress in a Musical, and the musical was nominated as Best Reproduction (Play or Musical). Allen won the Drama Desk Award as Outstanding Featured Actress in a Musical. Other notable cast members included Brent Barrett as Diesel, Harolyn Blackwell as Francisca, Stephen Bogardus as Mouth Piece and Reed Jones as Big Deal.\nThe Minskoff production subsequently opened the Nervi Festival in Genoa, Italy, in July 1981 with Josie de Guzman as Maria and Brent Barrett as Tony.\n2009 Broadway revival.\nIn 2007, Arthur Laurents stated: \"I've come up with a way of doing [\"West Side Story\"] that will make it absolutely contemporary without changing a word or a note\". He directed a pre-Broadway production of \"West Side Story\" at the National Theatre in Washington, D.C., that ran from December 15, 2008, through January 17, 2009. The Broadway revival began previews at the Palace Theatre on February 23, 2009, and opened on March 19. The production wove Spanish lyrics and dialogue into the English libretto. The translations are by Tony Award winner Lin-Manuel Miranda. Laurents said: \"The musical theatre and cultural conventions of 1957 made it next to impossible for the characters to have authenticity. Every member of both gangs was always a potential killer even then. Now they actually will be. Only Tony and Maria try to live in a different world\". In August 2009, some of the lyrics for \"A Boy Like That\" (\"Un Hombre Asi\") and \"I Feel Pretty\" (\"Me Siento Hermosa\"), which were previously sung in Spanish in the revival, were changed back to the original English. The Spanish lyrics sung by the Sharks in the \"Tonight\" (Quintet) remained in Spanish.\nThe cast featured Matt Cavenaugh as Tony, Josefina Scaglione as Maria, and Karen Olivo as Anita. Olivo won the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress, while Scaglione was nominated for the award for Leading Actress. Jeremy Jordan later was an alternate as Tony. The cast recording won the Grammy Award for Best Musical Show Album. In July 2010, the producers reduced the size of the orchestra, replacing five musicians with an off-stage synthesizer. The production closed on January 2, 2011, after 748 performances and 27 previews. The revival sold 1,074,462 tickets on Broadway over the course of nearly two years and was a financial success.\n2020 Broadway revival.\nA Broadway revival of \"West Side Story\" began previews on December 10, 2019, and officially opened on February 20, 2020, at the Broadway Theatre. It was directed by Ivo van Hove, with choreography by Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker and was produced by Scott Rudin, Barry Diller and David Geffen. The cast included Shereen Pimentel as Maria, Isaac Cole Powell as Tony, Amar Ramasar as Bernardo, Thomas Jay Ryan as Lt. Schrank and Yesenia Ayala as Anita. Scenic and lighting design were by Jan Versweyveld, with costumes by An d'Huys.\nThe production cut the song \"I Feel Pretty\" and trimmed the book to one hour and forty-five minutes (with no intermission). The setting was \"loosely updated to the present\", and direction was \"determined to snuff out any lightness that might temper the full-blown tragedy to come\". The original balletic, finger snapping choreography was replaced by swaggering, hip-hop and Latin-influenced dancing. The set consisted mostly of large screens featuring video, several cast members carried iPhones, and the Jets were not all white. Some theatergoers felt that the set turned the theatre into a cinema, but critic Charles McNulty argued that it wove technology into a multimedia \"performance work that defies our usual vocabulary\". The production also drew criticism for its casting of Ramasar, who had been accused of sexually inappropriate behavior and was fired from the New York City Ballet and suspended from \"Carousel\", as well as the graphic staging of the Jets' assault and attempted rape of Anita which, together, \"sends a message that women's bodies are collateral damage in male artistic success\". Van Hove's casting of African American Jets, \"dangerously, shifts our focus away from the enduring problem of white supremacist violence\". While praising the cast, except for Ramasar, Alexandra Schwartz, writing in \"The New Yorker\", felt that the use of the videos \"dwarfs the actors with their own gigantic images... the technique is banal\", while the mixed casting of the Jets creates \"a bitter, unintended irony in the context of African-American history\".\nMarch 11, 2020, was the show's last performance before production was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of its opening date, it was not eligible for 2020 Tony Award consideration. The production did not reopen, and so its total run was 78 previews and 24 performances.\nOther notable US productions and tours.\nThe New York City Center Light Opera Company production played for a limited engagement of 31 performances from April 8 to May 3, 1964. The cast featured Don McKay (Tony), Julia Migenes (Maria) and Luba Lisa (Anita). It was staged by Gerald Freedman with choreography re-mounted by Tom Abbott. The Musical Theater of Lincoln Center and Richard Rodgers production opened at the New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, in June 1968 and closed in September after 89 performances. Direction and choreography were reproduced by Lee Theodore, and scenery was by Oliver Smith. Tony was played by Kurt Peterson, with Victoria Mallory as Maria. A 1987 US tour starred Jack Wagner as Tony, with Valarie Pettiford as Anita and was directed by Alan Johnson.\nA national tour, directed by Alan Johnson, was produced in 2002. A national tour of the 2009 Broadway revival began in October 2010 at the Fisher Theatre in Detroit, Michigan, and toured for two seasons. The cast featured Kyle Harris as Tony and Ali Ewoldt as Maria. Chicago Lyric Opera staged the musical in 2019 and again in 2023, directed by Francesca Zambello and choreographed by Joshua Bergasse; Ryan McCartan starred as Tony.\nThe musical has also been adapted to be performed as \"Deaf Side Story\" using both English and American Sign Language, with deaf Sharks and hearing Jets.\nInternational productions.\nThe first Australian production opened in October 1960 at the Princess Theatre in Melbourne, before touring to the Tivoli Theatre in Sydney in February 1961. Subsequent Australian tours have been staged in 1983, 1994, 2010 and twice in 2019. It returned to Handa Opera on Sydney Harbour in 2024.\nStaatstheater N\u00fcrnberg staged the first German production in 1972 in a German translation by Marcel Prawy which had been used for the first Austrian staging in 1968 at the Vienna Volksoper with Julia Migenes and Adolf Dallapozza, conducted by Lawrence Leonard. The first East German production took place in Leipzig in 1984 with Dagmar Schellenberger and Stephan Spiewok and the Gewandhaus Orchestra.\nA 2000 Hong Kong production with Cantonese lyrics featured Paul Wong as Tony at the outdoor plaza of Hong Kong Cultural Centre. Canada's Stratford Shakespeare Festival performed \"West Side Story\" in 1999, starring Tyley Ross as Tony and Ma-Anne Dionisio as Maria, and again in 2009, The Austrian Bregenz Festival presented the musical in the German translation by Prawy in 2003 and 2004, directed by Francesca Zambello, followed by a German tour. An international tour (2005\u20132010), directed and choreographed by Joey McKneely played in Tokyo, Paris, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Singapore, S\u00e3o Paulo, France, Taiwan, China, Italy, Rotterdam and Spain.\nNovosibirsk Globus Theatre staged the musical in Russia in 2007 with conductor Keith Clark, a former pupil of Bernstein's, who also conducted the 2010 Moscow production. A French language adaptation, translated by Philippe Gobeille, opened in Montreal, Quebec, in March 2008. A Philippine version played in 2008 at the Meralco Theater. It featured Christian Bautista as Tony, Karylle and Joanna Ampil as Maria. In 2011, a Lima production was produced by \"Preludio Asociaci\u00f3n Cultural\" with Marco Zunino as Tony, Rossana Fern\u00e1ndez-Maldonado as Maria, Jes\u00fas Neyra as Bernardo, Tati Alc\u00e1ntara as Anita and Joaqu\u00edn de Orbegoso as Riff.\nA Japanese production ran from November 2019 to January 2020, at the IHI Stage Around Tokyo, featuring a double cast with Mamoru Miyano and Shouta Aoi as Tony, and Kii Kitano and Rena Sasamoto as Maria, with Suzuko Mimori as Anita, Ryuji Kamiyama as Riff, and Masataka Nakagauchi as Bernardo.\nA South Korean production is set to run from November 2022 to February 2023 at the Chungmu Art Center in Seoul. Kim Junsu, Go Eunsung, and Park Kanghyun are cast as Tony, with Lee Jisoo and Han Jae-ah as Maria and Jung Taekwoon as Riff.\nCritical reaction.\nThe creators' innovations in dance, music and theatrical style drew enthusiastic reactions from the critics. Walter Kerr wrote in the \"New York Herald Tribune\" on September 27, 1957:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The radioactive fallout from \"West Side Story\" must still be descending on Broadway this morning. Director, choreographer, and idea-man Jerome Robbins has put together, and then blasted apart, the most savage, restless, electrifying dance patterns we've been exposed to in a dozen seasons ... the show rides with a catastrophic roar over the spider-web fire-escapes, the shadowed trestles, and the plain dirt battlegrounds of a big city feud ... there is fresh excitement in the next debacle, and the next. When a gang leader advises his cohorts to play it \"Cool\", the intolerable tension between an effort at control and the instinctive drives of these potential killers is stingingly graphic. When the knives come out, and bodies begin to fly wildly through space under buttermilk clouds, the sheer visual excitement is breathtaking ... Mr. Bernstein has permitted himself a few moments of graceful, lingering melody: in a yearning \"Maria\", in the hushed falling line of \"Tonight\", in the wistful declaration of \"I Have a Love\". But for the most part he has served the needs of the onstage threshing machine ... When hero Larry Kert is stomping out the visionary insistence of \"Something's Coming\" both music and tumultuous story are given their due. Otherwise it's the danced narrative that takes urgent precedence ...\nThe other reviews generally joined in speculation about how the new work would influence the course of musical theater. Typical was John Chapman's review in the \"New York Daily News\" on September 27, 1957, headed: \"\"West Side Story\" a Splendid and Super-Modern Musical Drama\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The American theatre took a venturesome forward step when the firm of Griffith &amp; Prince presented \"West Side Story\" at the Winter Garden last evening. This is a bold new kind of musical theatre \u2013 a juke-box Manhattan opera. It is, to me, extraordinarily exciting ... the manner of telling the story is a provocative and artful blend of music, dance and plot \u2013 and the music and the dancing are superb. In [the score], there is the drive, the bounce, the restlessness and the sweetness of our town. It takes up the American musical idiom where it was left when George Gershwin died. It is fascinatingly tricky and melodically beguiling, and it marks the progression of an admirable composer ...\n\"Time\" magazine found the dance and gang warfare more compelling than the love story and noted that the show's \"putting choreography foremost, may prove a milestone in musical-drama history\". One writer noted: \"The story appealed to society's undercurrent of rebellion from authority that surfaced in 1950s films like \"Rebel Without a Cause\". ... Robbins' energetic choreography and Bernstein's grand score accentuated the satiric, hard-edged lyrics of Sondheim, and Laurents' capture of the angry voice of urban youth. The play was criticized for glamorizing gangs, and its portrayal of Puerto Ricans and lack of authentic Latin casting were weaknesses. Yet, the same writer commented, the song \"America\" shows the triumph of the spirit over the obstacles often faced by immigrants. The musical also made points in its description of troubled youth and the devastating effects of poverty and racism. Juvenile delinquency is seen as an ailment of society: \"No one wants a fella with a social disease!\" The writer concluded: \"On the cusp of the 1960s, American society, still recovering from the enormous upheaval of World War II, was seeking stability and control\".\nScore.\nBernstein's score for \"West Side Story\" blends \"jazz, Latin rhythms, symphonic sweep and musical-comedy conventions in groundbreaking ways for Broadway\". It was orchestrated by Sid Ramin and Irwin Kostal following detailed instructions from Bernstein, who then wrote revisions on their manuscript (the original, heavily annotated by Ramin, Kostal and Bernstein, is in the Rare Books and Manuscripts Library at Columbia University). Ramin, Kostal and Bernstein are billed as orchestrators for the show. The original orchestra consisted of 31 players: a large Broadway pit orchestra enhanced to include 5 percussionists.\nIn 1960, Bernstein prepared a suite of orchestral music from the show, the \"Symphonic Dances from West Side Story\". It consists of nine movements: Prologue (\"Allegro moderato\"), \"Somewhere\" (\"Adagio\"), Scherzo (\"Vivace e leggero\"), Mambo (\"Meno presto\"), Cha-Cha (\"Andantino con grazia\"), Meeting Scene (\"Meno mosso\"), \"Cool\" Fugue (\"Allegretto\"), Rumble (\"Molto allegro\"), and Finale (\"Adagio\"). It premiered on February 13, 1961, at Carnegie Hall with the New York Philharmonic conducted by Lukas Foss. The suite was later included as bonus tracks on the original Broadway cast recording.\nAnalysis of the book.\nAs in \"Romeo and Juliet\", the love between members of two rival groups in \"West Side Story\" leads to violent confrontations \"and a tragic ending with an underlying message: Violence breeds violence, so make peace and learn to share turf\". Among the social themes explored in the musical are \"bigotry, cultural misunderstanding and the social failure to fully integrate and empower young people in constructive ways\".\nMisha Berson names four key differences from \"Romeo and Juliet\" in the musical: the feud derives from cultural difference; the plot omits the parents and former romances; the assault on Anita leads her to withhold the news of Maria's death from Tony; and Maria survives at the end. Carla Della Gatta adds an additional three: the Jets are the holders of public space (whereas the Capulets begin Shakespeare's play); Tony does not kill Chino (whereas Romeo kills Paris); and Chino kills Tony (whereas Paris does not kill Romeo).\nRecordings.\nRecordings of \"West Side Story\" include cast albums of the 1957 and 2009 Broadway productions and foreign productions sung in other languages, as well as live concert versions and studio albums. The 1958 West End production never released a cast album, but many of its stars recorded excerpts of the work across several recordings. Bernstein conducted the New York Philharmonic for a 1985 studio recording released by Deutsche Grammophon led by opera singers Jos\u00e9 Carreras and Kiri Te Kanawa. It won the Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album in 1986, and a television documentary about the making of that album won the BAFTA Award for Best Documentary the same year. The 2009 cast album won the same Grammy award in 2010. A 2013 concert recording by the San Francisco Symphony was nominated for a Grammy Award.\n\"West Side Story\" was adapted into films released in 1961 and 2021, and soundtrack albums were released for both movies. The musical's score has also been adapted by music arrangers and musical ensembles for albums over the decades. Bernstein arranged music from the show into a suite titled \"Symphonic Dances from West Side Story\", which has been recorded several times. The 1961 jazz album \"Kenton's West Side Story\", by Stan Kenton and the Stan Kenton Orchestra, won the 1962 Grammy Award for Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album.\nFilms.\n1961.\nThe 1961 film adaptation of the musical received praise from critics and the public and became the second-highest-grossing film of the year in the United States. The film won ten Academy Awards in its eleven nominated categories, including Best Picture. It received the most Academy Awards (10 wins) of any musical film, including Best Picture. Rita Moreno, as Anita, was the first Latina actress ever to win an Oscar. The soundtrack album won a Grammy Award and was ranked No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" chart for a record 54 weeks. Differences in the film from the stage version include moving \"Tonight\" to follow \"America\" and \"I Feel Pretty\" to precede the rumble. Diesel is renamed Ice. \"Gee, Officer Krupke\" is moved before \"Cool\" and is sung by Riff instead of Action, and \"Cool\" is sung by Ice instead of Riff. After Riff is killed, Ice takes control of the Jets, rather than Action.\n1979.\nA 1979 Egyptian adaptation ( transliterated as \"Quessat al-Ay al-Gharby\") was directed by Adel Sadeq based on the musical and the 1961 film. The cast features Hussein Fahmy as Sami, Soheir Ramzi as Amal, Samir Ghanem as Talib, Hassan Youssef as Recep, Saeed Saleh and Soheir Zaki.\n2021.\nA 2021 film adaptation, written by Tony Kushner, directed by Steven Spielberg and choreographed by Justin Peck, is based more closely on the Broadway musical than the 1961 film. The cast includes Ansel Elgort as Tony, newcomer Rachel Zegler as Maria, Ariana DeBose as Anita and Mike Faist as Riff. Moreno, who played Anita in the 1961 film, plays Valentina, a reconceived and expanded version of the character Doc, who serves as a mentor to the teenage characters, and sings \"Somewhere\" in this version. A new Black character, Abe, makes the cast \"more representative of ... 1950s New York\". Peck's choreography does not attempt to replicate Robbins' choreography. \"Gee, Officer Krupke\" and \"Cool\" are performed in the first half; \"One Hand, One Heart\" appears in between the two. The film received seven nominations at the 94th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, winning one Oscar for DeBose's performance.\nReferences in popular culture.\nThe television show \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" extensively referenced \"West Side Story\" in the 2009 season seven episode \"Officer Krupke\". In the third season of the series \"Glee\", three episodes feature characters auditioning, rehearsing and performing a school production of \"West Side Story\". The 2005 short musical comedy film \"West Bank Story\", which won the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film, concerns a love story between a Jew and a Palestinian and parodies several aspects of \"West Side Story\".\nIn 1963, the magazine \"Mad\" published \"East Side Story\" which was set at the United Nations building on the East Side of Manhattan, a parody of the Cold War, with the two rival gangs led by John F. Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev, by writer Frank Jacobs and illustrator Mort Drucker. In the \"Discworld\" series of books by Terry Pratchett, two feuding noble families are named Selachii and Venturi, the scientific names for \"sharks\" and \"jets\".\nFrom 1973 to 2004, \"Wild Side Story\", a camp parody musical, based loosely on \"West Side Story\" and adapting parts of the musical's music and lyrics, was performed a total of more than 500 times in Miami Beach, Florida, Stockholm, Gran Canaria and Los Angeles. The show lampoons the musical's tragic love story, and also lip-synching and drag shows.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Others define weight as a scalar quantity, the magnitude of the gravitational force. Yet others define it as the magnitude of the reaction force exerted on a body by mechanisms that counteract the effects of gravity: the weight is the quantity that is measured by, for example, a spring scale. Thus, in a state of free fall, the weight would be zero. In this sense of weight, terrestrial objects can be weightless: so if one ignores air resistance, one could say the legendary apple falling from the tree, on its way to meet the ground near Isaac Newton, was weightless.\nThe unit of measurement for weight is that of force, which in the International System of Units (SI) is the newton. For example, an object with a mass of one kilogram has a weight of about 9.8 newtons on the surface of the Earth, and about one-sixth as much on the Moon. Although weight and mass are scientifically distinct quantities, the terms are often confused with each other in everyday use (e.g. comparing and converting force weight in pounds to mass in kilograms and vice versa).\nFurther complications in elucidating the various concepts of weight have to do with the theory of relativity according to which gravity is modeled as a consequence of the curvature of spacetime. In the teaching community, a considerable debate has existed for over half a century on how to define weight for their students. The current situation is that a multiple set of concepts co-exist and find use in their various contexts.\nHistory.\nDiscussion of the concepts of heaviness (weight) and lightness (levity) date back to the ancient Greek philosophers. These were typically viewed as inherent properties of objects. Plato described weight as the natural tendency of objects to seek their kin. To Aristotle, weight and levity represented the tendency to restore the natural order of the basic elements: air, earth, fire and water. He ascribed absolute weight to earth and absolute levity to fire. Archimedes saw weight as a quality opposed to buoyancy, with the conflict between the two determining if an object sinks or floats. The first operational definition of weight was given by Euclid, who defined weight as: \"the heaviness or lightness of one thing, compared to another, as measured by a balance.\" Operational balances (rather than definitions) had, however, been around much longer.\nAccording to Aristotle, weight was the direct cause of the falling motion of an object, the speed of the falling object was supposed to be directly proportionate to the weight of the object. As medieval scholars discovered that in practice the speed of a falling object increased with time, this prompted a change to the concept of weight to maintain this cause-effect relationship. Weight was split into a \"still weight\" or , which remained constant, and the actual gravity or , which changed as the object fell. The concept of was eventually replaced by Jean Buridan's impetus, a precursor to momentum.\nThe rise of the Copernican view of the world led to the resurgence of the Platonic idea that like objects attract but in the context of heavenly bodies. In the 17th century, Galileo made significant advances in the concept of weight. He proposed a way to measure the difference between the weight of a moving object and an object at rest. Ultimately, he concluded weight was proportionate to the amount of matter of an object, not the speed of motion as supposed by the Aristotelean view of physics.\nNewton.\nThe introduction of Newton's laws of motion and the development of Newton's law of universal gravitation led to considerable further development of the concept of weight. Weight became fundamentally separate from mass. Mass was identified as a fundamental property of objects connected to their inertia, while weight became identified with the force of gravity on an object and therefore dependent on the context of the object. In particular, Newton considered weight to be relative to another object causing the gravitational pull, e.g. the weight of the Earth towards the Sun.\nNewton considered time and space to be absolute. This allowed him to consider concepts as true position and true velocity. Newton also recognized that weight as measured by the action of weighing was affected by environmental factors such as buoyancy. He considered this a false weight induced by imperfect measurement conditions, for which he introduced the term \"apparent weight\" as compared to the \"true weight\" defined by gravity.\nAlthough Newtonian physics made a clear distinction between weight and mass, the term weight continued to be commonly used when people meant mass. This led the 3rd General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) of 1901 to officially declare \"The word \"weight\" denotes a quantity of the same nature as a \"force\": the weight of a body is the product of its mass and the acceleration due to gravity\", thus distinguishing it from mass for official usage.\nRelativity.\nIn the 20th century, the Newtonian concepts of absolute time and space were challenged by relativity. Einstein's equivalence principle put all observers, moving or accelerating, on the same footing. This led to an ambiguity as to what exactly is meant by the force of gravity and weight. A scale in an accelerating elevator cannot be distinguished from a scale in a gravitational field. Gravitational force and weight thereby became essentially frame-dependent quantities. This prompted the abandonment of the concept as superfluous in the fundamental sciences such as physics and chemistry. Nonetheless, the concept remained important in the teaching of physics. The ambiguities introduced by relativity led, starting in the 1960s, to considerable debate in the teaching community as how to define weight for their students, choosing between a nominal definition of weight as the force due to gravity or an operational definition defined by the act of weighing.\nDefinitions.\nSeveral definitions exist for \"weight\", not all of which are equivalent.\nGravitational definition.\nThe most common definition of weight found in introductory physics textbooks defines weight as the force exerted on a body by gravity. This is often expressed in the formula \"W\" = \"mg\", where \"W\" is the weight, \"m\" the mass of the object, and \"g\" gravitational acceleration.\nIn 1901, the 3rd General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) established this as their official definition of \"weight\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The word \"weight\" denotes a quantity of the same nature as a \"force\": the weight of a body is the product of its mass and the acceleration due to gravity.\nThis resolution defines weight as a vector, since force is a vector quantity. However, some textbooks also take weight to be a scalar by defining:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The weight \"W\" of a body is equal to the magnitude \"Fg\" of the gravitational force on the body.\nThe gravitational acceleration varies from place to place. Sometimes, it is simply taken to have a standard value of 9.80665 m/s2, which gives the standard weight.\nThe force whose magnitude is equal to \"mg\" newtons is also known as the m kilogram weight (which term is abbreviated to kg-wt)\nOperational definition.\nIn the operational definition, the weight of an object is the force measured by the operation of weighing it, which is the force it exerts on its support. Since \"W\" is the downward force on the body by the centre of Earth and there is no acceleration in the body, there exists an opposite and equal force by the support on the body. It is equal to the force exerted by the body on its support because action and reaction have same numerical value and opposite direction. This can make a considerable difference, depending on the details; for example, an object in free fall exerts little if any force on its support, a situation that is commonly referred to as weightlessness. However, being in free fall does not affect the weight according to the gravitational definition. Therefore, the operational definition is sometimes refined by requiring that the object be at rest. However, this raises the issue of defining \"at rest\" (usually being at rest with respect to the Earth is implied by using standard gravity). In the operational definition, the weight of an object at rest on the surface of the Earth is lessened by the effect of the centrifugal force from the Earth's rotation.\nThe operational definition, as usually given, does not explicitly exclude the effects of buoyancy, which reduces the measured weight of an object when it is immersed in a fluid such as air or water. As a result, a floating balloon or an object floating in water might be said to have zero weight.\nISO definition.\nIn the ISO International standard ISO 80000-4:2006, describing the basic physical quantities and units in mechanics as a part of the International standard ISO/IEC 80000, the definition of \"weight\" is given as:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Definition\nformula_1,\nwhere \"m\" is mass and \"g\" is local acceleration of free fall.\nRemarks\nThe definition is dependent on the chosen frame of reference. When the chosen frame is co-moving with the object in question then this definition precisely agrees with the operational definition. If the specified frame is the surface of the Earth, the weight according to the ISO and gravitational definitions differ only by the centrifugal effects due to the rotation of the Earth.\nApparent weight.\nIn many real world situations the act of weighing may produce a result that differs from the ideal value provided by the definition used. This is usually referred to as the apparent weight of the object. For instance, when the gravitational definition of weight is used, the operational weight measured by an accelerating scale is often also referred to as the apparent weight. A common example of this is the effect of buoyancy, when an object is immersed in a fluid the displacement of the fluid will cause an upward force on the object, making it appear lighter when weighed on a scale. The apparent weight may be similarly affected by levitation and mechanical suspension.\nMass.\nIn modern scientific usage, weight and mass are fundamentally different quantities: mass is an intrinsic property of matter, whereas weight is a \"force\" that results from the action of gravity on matter: it measures how strongly the force of gravity pulls on that matter. However, in most practical everyday situations the word \"weight\" is used when, strictly, \"mass\" is meant. For example, most people would say that an object \"weighs one kilogram\", even though the kilogram is a unit of mass.\nThe distinction between mass and weight is unimportant for many practical purposes because the strength of gravity does not vary too much on the surface of the Earth. In a uniform gravitational field, the gravitational force exerted on an object (its weight) is directly proportional to its mass. For example, object A weighs 10 times as much as object B, so therefore the mass of object A is 10 times greater than that of object B. This means that an object's mass can be measured indirectly by its weight, and so, for everyday purposes, weighing (using a weighing scale) is an entirely acceptable way of measuring mass. Similarly, a balance measures mass indirectly by comparing the weight of the measured item to that of an object(s) of known mass. Since the measured item and the comparison mass are in virtually the same location, so experiencing the same gravitational field, the effect of varying gravity does not affect the comparison or the resulting measurement.\nThe Earth's gravitational field is not uniform but can vary by as much as 0.5% at different locations on Earth (see Earth's gravity). These variations alter the relationship between weight and mass, and must be taken into account in high-precision weight measurements that are intended to indirectly measure mass. Spring scales, which measure local weight, must be calibrated at the location at which the objects will be used to show this standard weight, to be legal for commerce.\nThis table shows the variation of acceleration due to gravity (and hence the variation of weight) at various locations on the Earth's surface.\nThe historical use of \"weight\" for \"mass\" also persists in some scientific terminology \u2013 for example, the chemical terms \"atomic weight\", \"molecular weight\", and \"formula weight\", can still be found rather than the preferred \"atomic mass\", etc.\nIn a different gravitational field, for example, on the surface of the Moon, an object can have a significantly different weight than on Earth. The gravity on the surface of the Moon is only about one-sixth as strong as on the surface of the Earth. A one-kilogram mass is still a one-kilogram mass (as mass is an intrinsic property of the object) but the downward force due to gravity, and therefore its weight, is only one-sixth of what the object would have on Earth. So a man of mass 180 pounds weighs only about 30 pounds-force when visiting the Moon.\nSI units.\nIn most modern scientific work, physical quantities are measured in SI units. The SI unit of weight is the same as that of force: the newton (N) \u2013 a derived unit which can also be expressed in SI base units as kg\u22c5m/s2 (kilograms times metres per second squared).\nIn commercial and everyday use, the term \"weight\" is usually used to mean mass, and the verb \"to weigh\" means \"to determine the mass of\" or \"to have a mass of\". Used in this sense, the proper SI unit is the kilogram (kg).\nPound and other non-SI units.\nIn United States customary units, the pound can be either a unit of force or a unit of mass. Related units used in some distinct, separate subsystems of units include the poundal and the slug. The poundal is defined as the force necessary to accelerate an object of one-pound \"mass\" at 1ft/s2, and is equivalent to about 1/32.2 of a pound-\"force\". The slug is defined as the amount of mass that accelerates at 1ft/s2 when one pound-force is exerted on it, and is equivalent to about 32.2 pounds (mass).\nThe kilogram-force is a non-SI unit of force, defined as the force exerted by a one-kilogram mass in standard Earth gravity (equal to 9.80665 newtons exactly). The dyne is the cgs unit of force and is not a part of SI, while weights measured in the cgs unit of mass, the gram, remain a part of SI.\nSensation.\nThe sensation of weight is caused by the force exerted by fluids in the vestibular system, a three-dimensional set of tubes in the inner ear. It is actually the sensation of g-force, regardless of whether this is due to being stationary in the presence of gravity, or, if the person is in motion, the result of any other forces acting on the body such as in the case of acceleration or deceleration of a lift, or centrifugal forces when turning sharply.\nMeasuring.\nWeight is commonly measured using one of two methods. A spring scale or hydraulic or pneumatic scale measures local weight, the local force of gravity on the object (strictly \"apparent\" weight force). Since the local force of gravity can vary by up to 0.5% at different locations, spring scales will measure slightly different weights for the same object (the same mass) at different locations. To standardize weights, scales are always calibrated to read the weight an object would have at a nominal standard gravity of 9.80665m/s2 (approx. 32.174ft/s2). However, this calibration is done at the factory. When the scale is moved to another location on Earth, the force of gravity will be different, causing a slight error. So to be highly accurate and legal for commerce, spring scales must be re-calibrated at the location at which they will be used.\nA \"balance\" on the other hand, compares the weight of an unknown object in one scale pan to the weight of standard masses in the other, using a lever mechanism \u2013 a lever-balance. The standard masses are often referred to, non-technically, as \"weights\". Since any variations in gravity will act equally on the unknown and the known weights, a lever-balance will indicate the same value at any location on Earth. Therefore, balance \"weights\" are usually calibrated and marked in mass units, so the lever-balance measures mass by comparing the Earth's attraction on the unknown object and standard masses in the scale pans. In the absence of a gravitational field, away from planetary bodies (e.g. space), a lever-balance would not work, but on the Moon, for example, it would give the same reading as on Earth. Some balances are marked in weight units, but since the weights are calibrated at the factory for standard gravity, the balance will measure standard weight, i.e. what the object would weigh at standard gravity, not the actual local force of gravity on the object.\nIf the actual force of gravity on the object is needed, this can be calculated by multiplying the mass measured by the balance by the acceleration due to gravity \u2013 either standard gravity (for everyday work) or the precise local gravity (for precision work). Tables of the gravitational acceleration at different locations can be found on the web.\nGross weight is a term that is generally found in commerce or trade applications, and refers to the total weight of a product and its packaging. Conversely, net weight refers to the weight of the product alone, discounting the weight of its container or packaging; and tare weight is the weight of the packaging alone.\nRelative weights on the Earth and other celestial bodies.\nThe table below shows comparative gravitational accelerations at the surface of the Sun, the Moon, and at each of the planets in the Solar System. The \"surface\" is taken to mean the cloud tops of the giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune). For the Sun, the surface is taken to mean the photosphere. The values in the table have not been de-rated for the centrifugal effect of planet rotation (and cloud-top wind speeds for the giant planets) and therefore, generally speaking, are similar to the actual gravity that would be experienced near the poles.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its name refers to the practice of wearing it inserted through one's \"obi\" or sash at one's side, whereas the larger \"tachi\" sword was worn slung from a cord.\nHistory.\nThe production of swords in Japan is divided into specific time periods:\n\"Wakizashi\" have been in use as far back as the 15th or 16th century. \nThe term \"wakizashi\" did not originally specify swords of any official blade length and was an abbreviation of \"wakizashi no katana\" (\"sword thrust at one's side\"); the term was applied to companion swords of all sizes.\nHowever, it was not until the Edo period in 1638 when the rulers of Japan tried to regulate the types of swords and the social strata which were allowed to wear them that the lengths of \"katana\" and \"wakizashi\" were officially set.\nDesign.\nThe \"wakizashi\" has a blade between in length. \"Wakizashi\" are not necessarily just a smaller version of the \"katana\"; they could be forged differently and have a different cross-section.\n\"Wakizashi\" were worn on the left side, secured to the waist sash (\"\"). \nVariants.\n\"Wakizashi\" close to the length of a \"katana\" are called \"\u014d-wakizashi\".\n\"Wakizashi\" closer to the length of a \"tant\u014d\" are called \"ko-wakizashi\".\nUsage.\nBy samurai.\nThe \"wakizashi\" was used as a backup or auxiliary sword; it was also used for close quarters fighting, to behead a defeated opponent and sometimes to commit seppuku. \nThe \"wakizashi\" was one of several short swords available for use by samurai including the \"yoroi t\u014dshi\", and the \"chisa-katana\". \nDuring the Edo period, the Tokugawa shogunate required samurai to wear \"Katana\" and shorter swords in pairs. These short swords were \"wakizashi\" and \"tanto\", and \"wakizashi\" were mainly selected. \nThe \"wakizashi\" being worn together with the \"katana\" was the official sign that the wearer was a samurai. When worn together, the pair of swords were called \"daish\u014d\", which translates literally as \"big-little\". Only \"samurai\" could wear the \"daish\u014d\": it represented their social power and personal honour. \nKanzan Sat\u014d, in his book titled \"The Japanese Sword\", notes that there did not seem to be any particular need for the \"wakizashi\" and suggests that the \"wakizashi\" may have become more popular than the \"tant\u014d\" because it was more suited for indoor fighting. He mentions the custom of leaving the \"katana\" at the door of a castle or palace when entering, while continuing to wear the \"wakizashi\" inside.\nBy civilians.\nDuring the Edo period, commoners were allowed to wear one legal-length \"ko-wakizashi\", which made it popular for the general public to wear wakizashi. This was common when traveling because of the risk of encountering bandits. \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the direct successor to Windows NT 4.0, and was released to manufacturing on December 15, 1999, and then to retail on February 17, 2000 for all versions, with Windows 2000 Datacenter Server being released to retail on September 26, 2000.\nWindows 2000 introduces NTFS 3.0, Encrypting File System, and basic and dynamic disk storage. Support for people with disabilities is improved over Windows NT 4.0 with a number of new assistive technologies, and Microsoft increased support for different languages and locale information. The Windows 2000 Server family has additional features, most notably the introduction of Active Directory, which in the years following became a widely used directory service in business environments. Although not present in the final release, support for Alpha (which was a 64-bit platform but only distributed as a 32-bit OS) was present in its alpha, beta, and release candidate versions. Its successor, Windows XP, only supports x86, x64 and Itanium processors. Windows 2000 was also the first NT release to drop the \"NT\" name from its product line.\nFour editions of Windows 2000 have been released: \"Professional\", \"Server\", \"Advanced Server\", and \"Datacenter Server\"; the latter of which was launched months after the other editions. While each edition of Windows 2000 is targeted at a different market, they share a core set of features, including many system utilities such as the Microsoft Management Console and standard system administration applications.\nMicrosoft marketed Windows 2000 as the most secure Windows version ever at the time; however, it became the target of a number of high-profile virus attacks such as Code Red and Nimda. Windows 2000 was succeeded by Windows XP a little over a year and a half later on October 2001 while Windows 2000 Server was succeeded by Windows Server 2003 more than three years after its initial release on April 2003. For ten years after its release, it continued to receive patches for security vulnerabilities nearly every month until reaching the end of support on July 13, 2010, the same day that support ended for Windows XP SP2.\nBoth the original Xbox and the Xbox 360 use a modified version of the Windows 2000 kernel as their system software; the former's source code was leaked in 2020.\nHistory.\nWindows 2000, originally named Windows NT 5.0, is a continuation of the Microsoft Windows NT family of operating systems, replacing Windows NT 4.0. Chairman and CEO Bill Gates was originally \"pretty confident\" Windows NT 5.0 would ship in the first half of 1998, revealing that the first set of beta builds had been shipped in early 1997; these builds were identical to Windows NT 4.0. The first official beta was released in September 1997, followed by Beta 2 in August 1998. On October 27, 1998, Microsoft announced that the name of the final version of the operating system would be Windows 2000, a name which referred to its projected release date. Windows 2000 Beta 3 was released in May 1999. Windows NT 5.0 Beta 1 was similar to Windows NT 4.0, including a very similarly themed logo. Windows NT 5.0 Beta 2 introduced a new 'mini' boot screen, and removed the 'dark space' theme in the logo. The Windows NT 5.0 betas had very long startup and shutdown sounds, though these were changed in the early Windows 2000 beta, but during Beta 3, a new piano-made startup and shutdown sounds were made, composed by Steven Ray Allen. It was featured in the final version as well as in Windows Me. The new login prompt from the final version made its first appearance in Beta 3 build 1946 (the first build of Beta 3). The new, updated icons (for \"My Computer\", \"Recycle Bin\" etc.) first appeared in Beta 3 build 1964. The Windows 2000 boot screen in the final version first appeared in Beta 3 build 1983. Windows 2000 did not have an actual codename because, according to Dave Thompson of Windows NT team, \"Jim Allchin didn't like codenames\". Service Pack 1 for Windows 2000 was codenamed \"Asteroid\".\nDuring development, builds for the Alpha architecture were compiled, but the project was abandoned in the final stages of development (between RC1 and RC2) after Compaq announced they had dropped support for Windows NT on Alpha. The Alpha 64-bit builds of Windows 2000 were also in development simultaneously with the 32-bit versions (versions of Windows NT for Alpha were 32-bit only due to it using 32-bit application binary interfaces on an otherwise 64-bit processor) until it to was discontinued; development of Windows for Alpha 64-bit continued on for some time as a development platform for the 64-bit Intel Itanium platform when no other Itanium hardware was available at the time. From here, Microsoft issued three release candidates between July and November 1999, and finally released the operating system to partners on December 12, 1999, followed by manufacturing three days later on December 15. The public could buy the full version of Windows 2000 on February 17, 2000. Three days before this event, which Microsoft advertised as \"a standard in reliability,\" a leaked memo from Microsoft reported on by Mary Jo Foley revealed that Windows 2000 had \"over 63,000 potential known defects.\" After Foley's article was published, she claimed that Microsoft blacklisted her for a considerable time. However, Abraham Silberschatz et al. claim in their computer science textbook that \"Windows 2000 was the most reliable, stable operating system Microsoft had ever shipped to that point. Much of this reliability came from maturity in the source code, extensive stress testing of the system, and automatic detection of many serious errors in drivers.\" InformationWeek summarized the release \"our tests show the successor to Windows NT 4.0 is everything we hoped it would be. Of course, it isn't perfect either.\" \"Wired News\" later described the results of the February launch as \"lackluster.\" Novell criticized Microsoft's Active Directory, the new directory service architecture, as less scalable or reliable than its own Novell Directory Services (NDS) alternative.\nWindows 2000 was initially planned to replace both Windows 98 and Windows NT 4.0. However, this would be changed later, as an updated version of Windows 98 called Windows 98 Second Edition was released in 1999.\nOn or shortly before February 12, 2004, \"portions of the Microsoft Windows 2000 and Windows NT 4.0 source code were illegally made available on the Internet.\" The source of the leak was later traced to Mainsoft, a Windows Interface Source Environment partner. Microsoft issued the following statement:\n \"Microsoft source code is both copyrighted and protected as a trade secret. As such, it is illegal to post it, make it available to others, download it or use it.\" \nDespite the warnings, the archive containing the leaked code spread widely on the file-sharing networks. On February 16, 2004, an exploit \"allegedly discovered by an individual studying the leaked source code\" for certain versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer was reported. On April 15, 2015, GitHub took down a repository containing a copy of the Windows NT 4.0 source code that originated from the leak.\nMicrosoft planned to release in 2000 a version of Windows 2000 which would run on 64-bit Intel Itanium microprocessors, specially codenamed \"Janus\". 64-bit builds of Windows 2000 were already in development for the Alpha 64-bit platform (which served as testing grounds for Itanium), however the first officially released 64-bit version of Windows was \"Windows XP 64-Bit Edition\", released alongside the 32-bit editions of Windows XP on October 25, 2001, followed by the server versions \"Windows Datacenter Server Limited Edition\" and later \"Windows Advanced Server Limited Edition\", which were based on the pre-release Windows Server 2003 (then known as \"Windows .NET Server\") codebase. These editions were released in 2002, were shortly available through the OEM channel and then were superseded by the final versions of Server 2003 on April 24, 2003.\nNew and updated features.\nWindows 2000 introduced many of the new features of Windows 98 and 98 SE into the NT line, such as the Windows Desktop Update, Internet Explorer\u00a05 (Internet Explorer\u00a06, which followed in 2001, is also available for Windows 2000), Outlook Express, NetMeeting, FAT32 support, 3DNow!, SSE and SSE2 support, Windows Driver Model, Internet Connection Sharing, Windows Media Player 6.4, WebDAV support etc. Certain new features are common across all editions of Windows 2000, among them NTFS 3.0, the Microsoft Management Console (MMC), UDF support, the Encrypting File System (EFS), Logical Disk Manager, Image Color Management 2.0, support for PostScript 3-based printers, OpenType codice_1 and Type 1 PostScript codice_2 font support (including a new font\u2014Palatino Linotype\u2014to showcase some OpenType features), the Data protection API (DPAPI), an LDAP/Active Directory-enabled Address Book, usability enhancements and multi-language and locale support. Windows 2000 also introduced USB device class drivers for USB printers, Mass storage class devices, and improved FireWire SBP-2 support for printers and scanners, along with a \"Safe removal\" applet for removable storage devices. Windows 2000 SP4 added native USB 2.0 support, Wireless Zero Configuration support and SSE3 support. Windows 2000 is also the first Windows version to support hibernation at the operating system level (OS-controlled ACPI S4 sleep state) unlike Windows 98 which required special drivers from the hardware manufacturer or driver developer.\nA new capability designed to protect critical system files called Windows File Protection was introduced. This protects critical Windows system files by preventing programs other than Microsoft's operating system update mechanisms such as the \"Package Installer\", Windows Installer and other update components from modifying them. The System File Checker utility provides users the ability to perform a manual scan of the integrity of all protected system files, and optionally repair them, either by restoring from a cache stored in a separate \"DLLCACHE\" directory, or from the original install media.\nMicrosoft recognized that a serious error (a Blue screen of death or stop error) could cause problems for servers that needed to be constantly running and so provided a system setting that would allow the server to automatically reboot when a stop error occurred. Also included is an option to dump any of the first 64 KB of memory to disk (the smallest amount of memory that is useful for debugging purposes, also known as a minidump), a dump of only the kernel's memory, or a dump of the entire contents of memory to disk, as well as write that this event happened to the Windows 2000 event log. In order to improve performance on servers running Windows 2000, Microsoft gave administrators the choice of optimizing the operating system's memory and processor usage patterns for background services or for applications. Windows 2000 also introduced core system administration and management features, such as the Windows Installer, Windows Management Instrumentation and Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) into the operating system.\nPlug and Play and hardware support improvements.\nThe most notable improvement from Windows NT 4.0 is the addition of Plug and Play with full ACPI and Windows Driver Model support. Similar to Windows 9x, Windows 2000 supports automatic recognition of installed hardware, hardware resource allocation, loading of appropriate drivers, PnP APIs and device notification events. The addition of the kernel PnP Manager along with the Power Manager are two significant subsystems added in Windows 2000.\nWindows 2000 introduced version 3 print drivers (user mode printer drivers) based on Unidrv, which made it easier for printer manufacturers to write device drivers for printers. Generic support for 5-button mice is also included as standard and installing IntelliPoint allows reassigning the programmable buttons. Windows 98 lacked generic support. Driver Verifier was introduced to stress test and catch device driver bugs.\nShell.\nWindows 2000 introduces layered windows that allow for transparency, translucency and various transition effects like shadows, gradient fills and alpha-blended GUI elements to top-level windows. Menus support a new \"Fade\" transition effect.\nThe Start menu in Windows 2000 introduces \"personalized menus\", expandable special folders and the ability to launch multiple programs without closing the menu by holding down the codice_3 key. A \"Re-sort\" button forces the entire Start Menu to be sorted by name. The Taskbar introduces support for balloon notifications which can also be used by application developers. Windows 2000 Explorer introduces customizable Windows Explorer toolbars, auto-complete in Windows Explorer address bar and Run box, advanced file type association features, displaying comments in shortcuts as tooltips, extensible columns in Details view (IColumnProvider interface), icon overlays, integrated search pane in Windows Explorer, sort by name function for menus, and \"Places bar\" in common dialogs for \"Open\" and \"Save\".\nWindows Explorer has been enhanced in several ways in Windows 2000. It is the first Windows NT release to include Active Desktop, first introduced as a part of Internet Explorer 4.0 (specifically Windows Desktop Update), and only pre-installed in Windows 98 by that time. It allowed users to customize the way folders look and behave by using HTML templates, having the file extension codice_4. This feature was abused by computer viruses that employed malicious scripts, Java applets, or ActiveX controls in folder template files as their infection vector. Two such viruses are VBS/Roor-C&lt;ref name=\"VBS/Roor-C\"&gt;\"Sophos\", http:// . Retrieved August 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and VBS.Redlof.a.\nThe \"Web-style\" folders view, with the left Explorer pane displaying details for the object currently selected, is turned on by default in Windows 2000. For certain file types, such as pictures and media files, the preview is also displayed in the left pane. Until the dedicated interactive preview pane appeared in Windows Vista, Windows 2000 had been the only Windows release to feature an interactive media player as the previewer for sound and video files, enabled by default. However, such a previewer can be enabled in previous versions of Windows with the Windows Desktop Update installed through the use of folder customization templates. The default file tooltip displays file title, author, subject and comments; this metadata may be read from a special NTFS stream, if the file is on an NTFS volume, or from an OLE structured storage stream, if the file is a structured storage document. All Microsoft Office documents since Office 4.0 make use of structured storage, so their metadata is displayable in the Windows 2000 Explorer default tooltip. File shortcuts can also store comments which are displayed as a tooltip when the mouse hovers over the shortcut. The shell introduces extensibility support through metadata handlers, icon overlay handlers and column handlers in Explorer \"Details view\".\nThe right pane of Windows 2000 Explorer, which usually just lists files and folders, can also be customized. For example, the contents of the system folders aren't displayed by default, instead showing in the right pane a warning to the user that modifying the contents of the system folders could harm their computer. It's possible to define additional Explorer panes by using DIV elements in folder template files. This degree of customizability is new to Windows 2000; neither Windows 98 nor the Desktop Update could provide it. The new DHTML-based search pane is integrated into Windows 2000 Explorer, unlike the separate search dialog found in all previous Explorer versions. The Indexing Service has also been integrated into the operating system and the search pane built into Explorer allows searching files indexed by its database.\nNTFS 3.0.\nMicrosoft released the version 3.0 of NTFS (sometimes incorrectly called \"NTFS 5\" in relation to the kernel version number) as part of Windows 2000; this introduced disk quotas (provided by QuotaAdvisor), file-system-level encryption, sparse files and reparse points. Sparse files allow for the efficient storage of data sets that are very large yet contain many areas that only have zeros. Reparse points allow the object manager to reset a file namespace lookup and let file system drivers implement changed functionality in a transparent manner. Reparse points are used to implement volume mount points, junctions, Hierarchical Storage Management, Native Structured Storage and Single Instance Storage. Volume mount points and directory junctions allow for a file to be transparently referred from one file or directory location to another.\nWindows 2000 also introduces a \"Distributed Link Tracking\" service to ensure file shortcuts remain working even if the target is moved or renamed. The target object's unique identifier is stored in the shortcut file on NTFS 3.0 and Windows can use the Distributed Link Tracking service for tracking the targets of shortcuts, so that the shortcut file may be silently updated if the target moves, even to another hard drive.\nEncrypting File System.\nThe Encrypting File System (EFS) introduced strong file system-level encryption to Windows. It allows any folder or drive on an NTFS volume to be encrypted transparently by the user. EFS works together with the EFS service, Microsoft's CryptoAPI and the EFS File System Runtime Library (FSRTL). To date, its encryption has not been compromised.\nEFS works by encrypting a file with a bulk symmetric key (also known as the File Encryption Key, or FEK), which is used because it takes less time to encrypt and decrypt large amounts of data than if an asymmetric key cipher were used. The symmetric key used to encrypt the file is then encrypted with a public key associated with the user who encrypted the file, and this encrypted data is stored in the header of the encrypted file. To decrypt the file, the file system uses the private key of the user to decrypt the symmetric key stored in the file header. It then uses the symmetric key to decrypt the file. Because this is done at the file system level, it is transparent to the user.\nFor a user losing access to their key, support for recovery agents that can decrypt files is built into EFS. A Recovery Agent is a user who is authorized by a public key recovery certificate to decrypt files belonging to other users using a special \"private key\". By default, local administrators are \"recovery agents\" however they can be customized using Group Policy.\nBasic and dynamic disk storage.\nWindows 2000 introduced the Logical Disk Manager and the diskpart command line tool for dynamic storage. All versions of Windows 2000 support three types of dynamic disk volumes (along with basic disks): \"simple volumes\", \"spanned volumes\" and \"striped volumes\":\nIn addition to these disk volumes, Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Advanced Server, and Windows 2000 Datacenter Server support \"mirrored volumes\" and \"striped volumes with parity\":\nAccessibility.\nWith Windows 2000, Microsoft introduced the Windows 9x accessibility features for people with visual and auditory impairments and other disabilities into the NT-line of operating systems. These included:\nAdditionally, Windows 2000 introduced the following new accessibility features:\nLanguages and locales.\nWindows 2000 introduced the Multilingual User Interface (MUI). Besides English, Windows 2000 incorporates support for Arabic, Armenian, Baltic, Central European, Cyrillic, Georgian, Greek, Hebrew, Indic, Japanese, Korean, simplified Chinese, Thai, traditional Chinese, Turkic, Vietnamese and Western European languages. It also has support for many different locales.\nSince Windows 2000, English versions of Windows (NT) can support display and input right-to-left languages (such as Arabic) and CJKV languages, but related files needed to be installed in Control Panel.\nGames.\nWindows 2000 included version 7.0 of the DirectX API, commonly used by game developers on Windows 98. The last version of DirectX that was released for Windows 2000 was DirectX 9.0c (Shader Model 3.0), which shipped with Windows XP Service Pack 2. Microsoft published quarterly updates to DirectX 9.0c through the February 2010 release after which support was dropped in the June 2010 SDK. These updates contain bug fixes to the core runtime and some additional libraries such as D3DX, XAudio 2, XInput and Managed DirectX components. The majority of games written for versions of DirectX 9.0c (up to the February 2010 release) therefore run on Windows 2000.\nWindows 2000 included the same games as Windows NT 4.0 did: FreeCell, Minesweeper, Pinball, and Solitaire.\nSystem utilities.\nWindows 2000 introduced the Microsoft Management Console (MMC), which is used to create, save, and open administrative tools. Each of these is called a \"console\", and most allow an administrator to administer other Windows 2000 computers from one centralised computer. Each console can contain one or many specific administrative tools, called \"snap-ins\". These can be either standalone (with one function), or an extension (adding functions to an existing snap-in). In order to provide the ability to control what snap-ins can be seen in a console, the MMC allows consoles to be created in \"author mode\" or \"user mode\". Author mode allows snap-ins to be added, new windows to be created, all portions of the console tree to be displayed and consoles to be saved. User mode allows consoles to be distributed with restrictions applied. User mode consoles can grant full access to the user for any change, or they can grant limited access, preventing users from adding snapins to the console though they can view multiple windows in a console. Alternatively users can be granted limited access, preventing them from adding to the console and stopping them from viewing multiple windows in a single console.\nThe main tools that come with Windows 2000 can be found in the \"Computer Management\" console (in Administrative Tools in the Control Panel). This contains the Event Viewer\u2014a means of viewing system or application-related events and the Windows equivalent of a log file, a system information utility, a backup utility, Task Scheduler and management consoles to view open shared folders and shared folder sessions, configure and manage COM+ applications, configure Group Policy, manage all the local users and user groups, and a device manager. It contains \"Disk Management\" and \"Removable Storage\" snap-ins, a disk defragmenter as well as a performance diagnostic console, which displays graphs of system performance and configures data logs and alerts. It also contains a service configuration console, which allows users to view all installed services and to stop and start them, as well as configure what those services should do when the computer starts. CHKDSK has significant performance improvements.\nWindows 2000 comes with two utilities to edit the Windows registry, \"REGEDIT.EXE\" and \"REGEDT32.EXE\". REGEDIT has been directly ported from Windows 98, and therefore does not support editing registry permissions. REGEDT32 has the older multiple document interface (MDI) and can edit registry permissions in the same manner that Windows NT's REGEDT32 program could. REGEDIT has a left-side tree view of the Windows registry, lists all loaded hives and represents the three components of a value (its name, type, and data) as separate columns of a table. REGEDT32 has a left-side tree view, but each hive has its own window, so the tree displays only keys and it represents values as a list of strings. REGEDIT supports right-clicking of entries in a tree view to adjust properties and other settings. REGEDT32 requires all actions to be performed from the top menu bar. Windows XP is the first system to integrate these two programs into a single utility, adopting the REGEDIT behavior with the additional NT features.\nThe System File Checker (SFC) also comes with Windows 2000. It is a command line utility that scans system files and verifies whether they were signed by Microsoft and works in conjunction with the Windows File Protection mechanism. It can also repopulate and repair all the files in the \"Dllcache\" folder.\nRecovery Console.\nThe Recovery Console is run from outside the installed copy of Windows to perform maintenance tasks that can neither be run from within it nor feasibly be run from another computer or copy of Windows 2000. It is usually used to recover the system from problems that cause booting to fail, which would render other tools useless, like Safe Mode or Last Known Good Configuration, or codice_11. It includes commands like codice_12, which are not present in MS-DOS.\nIt has a simple command-line interface, used to check and repair the hard drive(s), repair boot information (including NTLDR), replace corrupted system files with fresh copies from the CD, or enable/disable services and drivers for the next boot.\nThe console can be accessed in either of the two ways:\nWindows Scripting Host 2.0.\nWindows 2000 introduced Windows Script Host 2.0 which included an expanded object model and support for logon and logoff scripts.\nServer family features.\nThe Windows 2000 Server family consists of Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Advanced Server, Windows 2000 Small Business Server, and Windows 2000 Datacenter Server.\nAll editions of Windows 2000 Server have the following services and features built in:\nThe Server editions include more features and components, including the Microsoft Distributed File System (DFS), Active Directory support and fault-tolerant storage.\nDistributed File System.\nThe Distributed File System (DFS) allows shares in multiple different locations to be logically grouped under one folder, or \"DFS root\". When users try to access a network share off the DFS root, the user is really looking at a \"DFS link\" and the DFS server transparently redirects them to the correct file server and share. A DFS root can only exist on a Windows 2000 version that is part of the server family, and only one DFS root can exist on that server.\nThere can be two ways of implementing a DFS namespace on Windows 2000: either through a standalone DFS root or a domain-based DFS root. Standalone DFS allows for only DFS roots on the local computer, and thus does not use Active Directory. Domain-based DFS roots exist within Active Directory and can have their information distributed to other domain controllers within the domain \u2013 this provides fault tolerance to DFS. DFS roots that exist on a domain must be hosted on a domain controller or on a domain member server. The file and root information is replicated via the Microsoft File Replication Service (FRS).\nActive Directory.\nA new way of organizing Windows network domains, or groups of resources, called Active Directory, is introduced with Windows 2000 to replace Windows NT's earlier domain model. Active Directory's hierarchical nature allowed administrators a built-in way to manage user and computer policies and user accounts, and to automatically deploy programs and updates with a greater degree of scalability and centralization than provided in previous Windows versions. User information stored in Active Directory also provided a convenient phone book-like function to end users. Active Directory domains can vary from small installations with a few hundred objects, to large installations with millions. Active Directory can organise and link groups of domains into a contiguous domain name space to form \"trees\". Groups of trees outside of the same namespace can be linked together to form \"forests.\"\nActive Directory services could always be installed on a Windows 2000 Server Standard, Advanced, or Datacenter computer, and cannot be installed on a Windows 2000 Professional computer. However, Windows 2000 Professional is the first client operating system able to exploit Active Directory's new features. As part of an organization's migration, Windows NT clients continued to function until all clients were upgraded to Windows 2000 Professional, at which point the Active Directory domain could be switched to native mode and maximum functionality achieved.\nActive Directory requires a DNS server that supports SRV resource records, or that an organization's existing DNS infrastructure be upgraded to support this. There should be one or more domain controllers to hold the Active Directory database and provide Active Directory directory services.\nVolume fault tolerance.\nAlong with support for simple, spanned and striped volumes, the Windows 2000 Server family also supports fault-tolerant volume types. The types supported are \"mirrored volumes\" and \"RAID-5 volumes\":\nDeployment.\nWindows 2000 can be deployed to a site via various methods. It can be installed onto servers via traditional media (such as CD) or via distribution folders that reside on a shared folder. Installations can be attended or unattended. During a manual installation, the administrator must specify configuration options. Unattended installations are scripted via an answer file, or a predefined script in the form of an INI file that has all the options filled in. An answer file can be created manually or using the graphical \"Setup manager\". The Winnt.exe or Winnt32.exe program then uses that answer file to automate the installation. Unattended installations can be performed via a bootable CD, using Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS), via the System Preparation Tool (Sysprep), via the Winnt32.exe program using the /syspart switch or via Remote Installation Services (RIS). The ability to slipstream a service pack into the original operating system setup files is also introduced in Windows 2000.\nThe Sysprep method is started on a standardized reference computer \u2013 though the hardware need not be similar \u2013 and it copies the required installation files from the reference computer to the target computers. The hard drive does not need to be in the target computer and may be swapped out to it at any time, with the hardware configured later. The Winnt.exe program must also be passed a /unattend switch that points to a valid answer file and a /s file that points to one or more valid installation sources.\nSysprep allows the duplication of a disk image on an existing Windows 2000 Server installation to multiple servers. This means that all applications and system configuration settings will be copied across to the new installations, and thus, the reference and target computers must have the same HALs, ACPI support, and mass storage devices \u2013 though Windows 2000 automatically detects \"plug and play\" devices. The primary reason for using Sysprep is to quickly deploy Windows 2000 to a site that has multiple computers with standard hardware. (If a system had different HALs, mass storage devices or ACPI support, then multiple images would need to be maintained.)\nSystems Management Server can be used to upgrade multiple computers to Windows 2000. These must be running Windows NT 3.51, Windows NT 4.0, Windows 98 or Windows 95 OSR2.x along with the SMS client agent that can receive software installation operations. Using SMS allows installations over a wide area and provides centralised control over upgrades to systems.\nRemote Installation Services (RIS) are a means to automatically install Windows 2000 Professional (and not Windows 2000 Server) to a local computer over a network from a central server. Images do not have to support specific hardware configurations and the security settings can be configured after the computer reboots as the service generates a new unique security ID (SID) for the machine. This is required so that local accounts are given the right identifier and do not clash with other Windows 2000 Professional computers on a network.\nRIS requires that client computers are able to boot over the network via either a network interface card that has a Pre-Boot Execution Environment (PXE) boot ROM installed or that the client computer has a network card installed that is supported by the remote boot disk generator. The remote computer must also meet the Net PC specification. The server that RIS runs on must be Windows 2000 Server and it must be able to access a network DNS Service, a DHCP service and the Active Directory services.\nEditions.\nMicrosoft released various editions of Windows 2000 for different markets and business needs: Professional, Server, Advanced Server and Datacenter Server. Each was packaged separately.\nWindows 2000 Professional was designed as the desktop operating system for businesses and power users. It is the client version of Windows 2000. It offers greater security and stability than many of the previous Windows desktop operating systems. It supports up to two processors, and can address up to 4GB of RAM. The system requirements are a Pentium processor (or equivalent) of 133MHz or greater, at least 32MB of RAM, 650MB of hard drive space, and a CD-ROM drive (recommended: Pentium II, 128MB of RAM, 2GB of hard drive space, and CD-ROM drive). However, despite the official minimum processor requirements, it is still possible to install Windows 2000 on 4th-generation x86 CPUs such as the 80486.\nWindows 2000 Embedded and Windows 2000 Professional Embedded/Windows 2000 Professional For Embedded Systems are versions of Windows 2000 Professional that was designed for embedded use, and targeted at ATMs, vending machines and other large embedded devices. Windows 2000 Embedded was cancelled during development in favor of Windows XP Embedded, however the binary identical FES versions were released and function exactly the same as its retail counterpart, but licensed for embedded use.\nWindows 2000 Server shares the same user interface with Windows 2000 Professional, but contains additional components for the computer to perform server roles and run infrastructure and application software. A significant new component introduced in the server versions is Active Directory, which is an enterprise-wide directory service based on LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol). Additionally, Microsoft integrated Kerberos network authentication, replacing the often-criticised NTLM (NT LAN Manager) authentication system used in previous versions. This also provided a purely transitive-trust relationship between Windows 2000 Server domains in a \"forest\" (a collection of one or more Windows 2000 domains that share a common schema, configuration, and global catalog, being linked with two-way transitive trusts). Furthermore, Windows 2000 introduced a Domain Name Server which allows dynamic registration of IP addresses. Windows 2000 Server supports up to 4 processors and 4GB of RAM, with a minimum requirement of 128MB of RAM and 1GB hard disk space, however requirements may be higher depending on installed components.\nWindows 2000 Server Embedded and Windows 2000 Server For Embedded Systems are binary identical versions of Windows 2000 Server that was targeted at the embedded market. Both versions function exactly the same as its retail counterpart, but is licensed for embedded use.\nWindows 2000 Advanced Server is a variant of Windows 2000 Server operating system designed for medium-to-large businesses. It offers the ability to create clusters of servers, support for up to 8 CPUs, a main memory amount of up to 8GB on Physical Address Extension (PAE) systems and the ability to do 8-way SMP. It supports TCP/IP load balancing and builds on Microsoft Cluster Server (MSCS) in Windows NT Enterprise Server 4.0, adding enhanced functionality for two-node clusters. System requirements are similar to those of Windows 2000 Server, however they may need to be higher to scale to larger infrastructure.\nWindows 2000 Datacenter Server is a variant of Windows 2000 Server designed for large businesses that move large quantities of confidential or sensitive data frequently via a central server. Like Advanced Server, it supports clustering, failover and load balancing. Its minimum system requirements are similar to those of Advanced Server, but it was designed to be capable of handing advanced, fault-tolerant and scalable hardware\u2014for instance computers with up to 32 CPUs and 32GBs RAM, with rigorous system testing and qualification, hardware partitioning, coordinated maintenance and change control. Windows 2000 Datacenter Server was released to manufacturing on August 11, 2000 and launched on September 26, 2000. This edition was based on Windows 2000 with Service Pack 1 and was not available at retail.\nService packs.\nWindows 2000 has received four full service packs and one rollup update package following SP4, which is the last service pack. Microsoft phased out all development of its Java Virtual Machine (JVM) from Windows 2000 in SP3. Internet Explorer 5.01 has also been upgraded to the corresponding service pack level.\nService Pack 4 with Update Rollup was released on September 13, 2005, nearly four years following the release of Windows XP and sixteen months prior to the release of Windows Vista.\nMicrosoft had originally intended to release a fifth service pack for Windows 2000, but cancelled this project early in its development, and instead released Update Rollup 1 for SP4, a collection of all the security-related hotfixes and some other significant issues. The Update Rollup does not include all non-security related hotfixes and is not subjected to the same extensive regression testing as a full service pack. Microsoft states that this update will meet customers' needs better than a whole new service pack, and will still help Windows 2000 customers secure their PCs, reduce support costs, and support existing computer hardware.\nUpgradeability.\nSeveral Windows 2000 components are upgradable to the latest versions, which include new versions introduced in later versions of Windows, and other major Microsoft applications are available. These latest versions for Windows 2000 include:\nSecurity.\nDuring the Windows 2000 period, the nature of attacks on Windows servers changed: more attacks came from remote sources via the Internet. This has led to an overwhelming number of malicious programs exploiting the IIS services \u2013 specifically a notorious buffer overflow tendency. This tendency is not operating-system-version specific, but rather configuration-specific: it depends on the services that are enabled. Following this, a common complaint is that \"by default, Windows 2000 installations contain numerous potential security problems. Many unneeded services are installed and enabled, and there is no active local security policy.\" In addition to insecure defaults, according to the SANS Institute, the most common flaws discovered are remotely exploitable buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Other criticized flaws include the use of vulnerable encryption techniques.\nCode Red and Code Red II were famous (and much discussed) worms that exploited vulnerabilities of the Windows Indexing Service of Windows 2000's Internet Information Services (IIS). In August 2003, security researchers estimated that two major worms called Sobig and Blaster infected more than half a million Microsoft Windows computers. The 2005 Zotob worm was blamed for security compromises on Windows 2000 machines at ABC, CNN, the New York Times Company, and the United States Department of Homeland Security.\nOn September 8, 2009, Microsoft skipped patching two of the five security flaws that were addressed in the monthly security update, saying that patching one of the critical security flaws was \"infeasible.\" According to Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09-048: \"The architecture to properly support TCP/IP protection does not exist on Microsoft Windows 2000 systems, making it infeasible to build the fix for Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 to eliminate the vulnerability. To do so would require re-architecting a very significant amount of the Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 operating system, there would be no assurance that applications designed to run on Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 would continue to operate on the updated system.\" No patches for this flaw were released for the newer Windows XP (32-bit) and Windows XP Professional x64 Edition either, despite both also being affected; Microsoft suggested turning on Windows Firewall in those versions.\nSupport lifecycle.\nWindows 2000 and Windows 2000 Server were superseded by newer Microsoft operating systems: Windows 2000 Server products by Windows Server 2003, and Windows 2000 Professional by Windows XP Professional.\nThe Windows 2000 family of operating systems moved from mainstream support to the extended support phase on June 30, 2005. Microsoft says that this marks the progression of Windows 2000 through the Windows lifecycle policy. Under mainstream support, Microsoft freely provides design changes if any, service packs and non-security related updates in addition to security updates, whereas in extended support, service packs are not provided and non-security updates require contacting the support personnel by e-mail or phone. Under the extended support phase, Microsoft continued to provide critical security updates every month for all components of Windows 2000 (including Internet Explorer 5.0 SP4) and paid per-incident support for technical issues. Because of Windows 2000's age, updated versions of components such as Windows Media Player 11 and Internet Explorer 7 have not been released for it. In the case of Internet Explorer, Microsoft said in 2005 that, \"some of the security work in IE 7 relies on operating system functionality in XP SP2 that is non-trivial to port back to Windows 2000.\" (though ironically, support for both Windows 2000 and Windows XP SP2 ended on July 13, 2010).\nWhile users of Windows 2000 Professional and Server were eligible to purchase the upgrade license for Windows Vista Business or Windows Server 2008, neither of these operating systems can directly perform an upgrade installation from Windows 2000; a clean installation must be performed instead or a two-step upgrade through XP/2003. Microsoft has dropped the upgrade path from Windows 2000 (and earlier) to Windows 7. Users of Windows 2000 must buy a full Windows 7 license.\nAlthough Windows 2000 is the last NT-based version of Microsoft Windows which does not include product activation, Microsoft has introduced Windows Genuine Advantage for certain downloads and non-critical updates from the Download Center for Windows 2000.\nWindows 2000 reached the end of its lifecycle (EoL) on July 13, 2010 (alongside Service Pack 2 of Windows XP). It will not receive new security updates and new security-related hotfixes after this date. In Japan, over 130,000 servers and 500,000 PCs in local governments were affected; many local governments said that they will not update as they do not have funds to cover a replacement.\nAs of 2011, Windows Update still supports the Windows 2000 updates available on Patch Tuesday in July 2010, e.g., if older optional Windows 2000 features are enabled later. Microsoft Office products under Windows 2000 have their own product lifecycles. While Internet Explorer 6 for Windows XP did receive security patches up until it lost support, this is not the case for IE6 under Windows 2000. The Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool installed monthly by Windows Update for XP and later versions can be still downloaded manually for Windows 2000.\nIn 2020, Microsoft announced that it would disable the Windows Update service for SHA-1 endpoints for older Windows versions. Since Windows 2000 did not get an update for SHA-2, Windows Update Services are no longer available on the OS as of late July 2020. As of March 2024, many of the old updates for Windows 2000 are still available on the Microsoft Update Catalog. A third-party tool named Legacy Update allows previously released updates for Windows 2000 to be installed from the Update Catalog. An independent project named Windows Update Restored is also available since 2022 and aims to restore the Windows Update websites for older versions of Windows, including Windows 2000.\nTotal cost of ownership.\nIn October 2002, Microsoft commissioned IDC to determine the total cost of ownership (TCO) for enterprise applications on Windows 2000 versus the TCO of the same applications on Linux. IDC's report is based on telephone interviews of IT executives and managers of 104 North American companies in which they determined what they were using for a specific workload for file, print, security and networking services.\nIDC determined that the four areas where Windows 2000 had a better TCO than Linux \u2013 over a period of five years for an average organization of 100 employees \u2013 were file, print, network infrastructure and security infrastructure. They determined, however, that Linux had a better TCO than Windows 2000 for web serving. The report also found that the greatest cost was not in the procurement of software and hardware, but in staffing costs and downtime. While the report applied a 40% productivity factor during IT infrastructure downtime, recognizing that employees are not entirely unproductive, it did not consider the impact of downtime on the profitability of the business. The report stated that Linux servers had less unplanned downtime than Windows 2000 servers. It found that most Linux servers ran less workload per server than Windows 2000 servers and also that none of the businesses interviewed used 4-way SMP Linux computers. The report also did not take into account specific application servers \u2013 servers that need low maintenance and are provided by a specific vendor. The report did emphasize that TCO was only one factor in considering whether to use a particular IT platform, and also noted that as management and server software improved and became better packaged the overall picture shown could change.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "33948", "revid": "39605961", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33948", "title": "Walloons", "text": "Ethnic group native to Wallonia, Belgium\nWalloons ( ; ; ) are a Gallo-Romance ethnic group native to Wallonia, Belgium. Walloons primarily speak \"langues d'o\u00efl\" such as Belgian French, Picard and Walloon. Walloons are primarily Roman Catholic, with a historical minority of Protestantism which dates back to the Reformation era.\nIn modern Belgium, Walloons are, by law, termed a \"distinctive linguistic and ethnic community\" within the country, as are the neighbouring Flemish, a Dutch (Germanic) speaking community.\nWhen understood as a regional identification, the ethnonym is also extended to refer to the inhabitants of the Walloon region in general, regardless of ethnicity or ancestry.\nEtymology.\nThe term \"Walloon\" is derived from \"*walha\", a Proto-Germanic term used to refer to Celtic and Latin speakers.\n\"Walloon\" originated in Romance languages alongside other related terms, but it supplanted them. Its oldest written trace is found in Jean de Haynin's \"M\u00e9moires de Jean, sire de Haynin et de Louvignies\" in 1465, where it refers to Roman populations of the Burgundian Netherlands. Its meaning narrowed yet again during the French and Dutch periods and, at Belgian independence, the term designated only Belgians speaking a Romance language (French, Walloon, Picard, etc.) The linguistic cleavage in the politics of Belgium adds a political content to \"the emotional cultural, and linguistic concept\". The words \"Walloon\" and \"Wallons\" can be seen in the book of Charles White, \"The Belgic Revolution\" (1835): \"The restless Wallons, with that adventurous daring which is their historical characteristic, abandoned their occupations, and eagerly seizing the pike and the musket marched towards the centre of the commotion.\" The Spanish terms of Walon and Walona from the 17th century referred to a Royal Guard Corps recruited in the Spanish Flanders. They were involved in many of the most significant battles of the Spanish Empire.\nAlbert Henry wrote that although in 1988 the word \"Walloon\" evoked a constitutional reality, it originally referred to Roman populations of the Burgundian Netherlands and was also used to designate a territory by the terms \"provinces wallonnes\" or \"pays wallon\" (Walloon country), from the 16th century to the Belgian revolution, and later Wallonia. The term 'Walloon country' was also used in Dutch viz. \"Walsch land\". The term existed also in German, perhaps \"Wulland\" in Hans Heyst's 1571 book, where that word is later (1814) translated to Wallonia in English. In German it is however generally \"Wallonenland\". In English, it is Walloon country (see further James Shaw). In French it is \"le Pays wallon\". For F\u00e9lix Rousseau, Walloon country is, after \"le Roman pays\" the old name of the country of the Walloons.\nInstitutional aspects.\nThe term \"state reform\" in the Belgian context indicates a process towards finding constitutional and legal solutions for the problems and tensions among the different segments of the Belgian population, mostly Dutch-speakers of Flanders and French-speakers of Wallonia. In general, Belgium evolved from a unitary state to a federal state with communities, regions and language areas.\nConceptual aspects.\nWallonia.\nThe area now known as Wallonia has been settled by various Celtic tribes and later by Roman and Frankish settlers. From the early Middle Ages up until the early modern period, the region has been separated between many city-states and external powers. Such changing rule brought variations to borders, culture, and language. The Walloon language, widespread in use up until the Second World War, has been dying out of common use due in part to its prohibition by the public school system, in favor of French.\nStarting from the end of the 19th century, the Walloon Movement, aiming to assert the identity of Walloons as French-speaking (rather than Walloon speaking) people of Belgium. In this context, the concept of Wallonia, as a heartland of the Walloon people was invented in 1886.\nLater, this was complicated by the federal structure given to Belgium, which splits Belgium into three communities with the privilege of using their own tongues in official correspondence, but also into three autonomous regions. The communities are: French community (though not Walloon, but sometimes controversially called \"Wallonia-Brussels\"), Flemish community (which uses Dutch), and German-speaking community. The division into political regions does not correspond with the communities: Flemish Region, Walloon Region (including the German community but generally called Wallonia), and the bilingual (French-Dutch) Brussels-Capital Region.\nBrussels - not Walloon and mostly French-speaking.\nMany non-French-speaking observers (over)generalize \"Walloons\" as a term of convenience for all Belgian French-speakers (even those born and living in the Brussels-Capital Region). The mixing of the population over the centuries means that most families can trace ancestors on both sides of the linguistic divide. But, the fact that Brussels is around 85% French-speaking, but is located in Dutch-speaking Flanders, has led to friction between the regions and communities. The local dialect in Brussels, \"Brussels Vloms\", is a Brabantic dialect, reflecting the Dutch heritage of the city.\nWalloons are historically credited with pioneering the Industrial Revolution in Continental Europe in the early 19th century. In modern history, Brussels has been the major town or the capital of the region. Because of long Spanish and minor French rule, French became the sole official language. After a brief period with Dutch as the official language while the region was part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, the people reinstated French after achieving independence in 1830. The Walloon region, a major coal and steel-producing area, developed rapidly into the economic powerhouse of the country. Walloons (in fact French-speaking elites who were called \"Walloons\") became politically dominant. Many Flemish immigrants came to work in Wallonia. Between the 1930s and the 1970s, the gradual decline of steel and more especially coal, coupled with too little investment in service industries and light industry (which came to predominate in Flanders), started to tip the balance in the other direction. Flanders became gradually politically and economically dominant. In their turn, Walloon families have moved to Flanders in search of jobs. This evolution has not been without political repercussions.\nWalloon identity.\nThe heartland of Walloon culture are the Meuse and Sambre river valleys, Charleroi, Dinant, Namur (the regional capital), Huy, Verviers, and Li\u00e8ge.\nRegional language statistics.\nThe Walloon language is an element of Walloon identity. However, the entire French-speaking population of Wallonia cannot be culturally considered Walloon, since a significant portion in the west (around Tournai and Mons) and smaller portions in the extreme south (around Arlon) possess other languages as mother tongues (namely, Picard, Champenois, Lorrain, Flemish, German and Luxembourgish).\nA survey of the \"Centre li\u00e9geois d'\u00e9tude de l'opinion\" pointed out in 1989 that 71.8% of the younger people of Wallonia understand and speak only a little or no Walloon language; 17.4% speak it well; and only 10.4% speak it exclusively. Based on other surveys and figures, Laurent Hendschel wrote in 1999 that between 30 and 40% people were bilingual in Wallonia (Walloon, Picard), among them 10% of the younger population (18\u201330 years old). According to Hendschel, there are 36 to 58% of young people have a passive knowledge of the regional languages. On the other hand, Givet \"commune\", several villages in the Ardennes \"d\u00e9partement\" in France, which publishes the journal \"Causons wallon\" (Let us speak Walloon); and two villages in Luxembourg are historically Walloon-speaking.\nWalloons in the Renaissance.\nIn 1572 Jean Bodin made a funny play on words which has been well known in Wallonia to the present:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Ouallonnes enim a Belgis appelamur [nous, les \"Gaulois\"], quod Gallis veteribus contigit, quuum orbem terrarum peragrarent, ac mutuo interrogantes qaererent \"o\u00f9 allons-nous\", id est quonam profiscimur? ex eo credibile est Ouallones appellatos quod Latini sua lingua nunquam efferunt, sed g lettera utuntur.\nTranslation: \"We are called \"Walloons\" by the Belgians because when the ancient people of Gallia were travelling the length and breadth of the earth, it happened that they asked each other: 'O\u00f9 allons-nous?' [Where are we going? : the pronunciation of these French words is the same as the French word \"Wallons\" (plus 'us')], i.e. 'To which goal are we walking?.' It is probable they took from it the name \"Ouallons\" (\"Wallons\"), which the Latin speaking are not able to pronounce without changing the word by the use of the letter G.\" One of the best translations of his (humorous) sayings used daily in Wallonia is \"These are strange times we are living in.\"\nShakespeare used the word Walloon: \"A base Walloon, to win the Dauphin's grace/Thrust Talbot with a spear in the back.\" A note in \"Henry VI, Part I\" says, \"At this time, the Walloons [were] the inhabitants of the area, now in south Belgium, still known as the 'Pays wallon'.\" Albert Henry agrees, quoting Maurice Piron, also quoted by A.J. Hoenselaars: \"'Walloon' meaning 'Walloon country' in Shakespeare's 'Henry VI'...\"\nWalloons and the Enlightenment.\nA 1786 history of the Netherlands noted, \"[The] Haynault and Namur, with Artois, now no longer an Austrian Province, compose the Walloon country. The Walloon name and language are also extended into the adjacent districts of the neighbouring Provinces. A large part of Brabant, where that Province borders on Haynault and Namur, is named Walloon Brabant. The affinity of language seems also on some occasions to have wrought a nearer relation.\"\nThe Belgian revolution of 1830.\nThe Belgian revolution was recently described as firstly a conflict between the Brussels municipality which was secondly disseminated in the rest of the country, \"particularly in the Walloon provinces\". We read the nearly same opinion in Edmundson's book: The royal forces, on the morning of September 23, entered the city at three gates and advanced as far as the Park. But beyond that point they were unable to proceed, so desperate was the resistance, and such the hail of bullets that met them from barricades and from the windows and roofs of the houses. For three days almost without cessation the fierce contest went on, the troops losing ground rather than gaining it. On the evening of the 26th the prince gave orders to retreat, his troops having suffered severely. The effect of this withdrawal was to convert a street insurrection into a national revolt. The moderates now united with the liberals, and a Provisional Government was formed, having amongst its members Charles Rogier, Van de Weyer, Gendebien, Emmanuel van der Linden d'Hooghvorst, F\u00e9lix de M\u00e9rode and Louis de Potter, who a few days later returned triumphantly from banishment. The Provisional Government issued a series of decrees declaring Belgium independent, releasing the Belgian soldiers from their allegiance, and calling upon them to abandon the Dutch standard. They were obeyed. The revolt, which had been confined mainly to the Walloon districts, now spread rapidly over Flanders. Jacques Logie wrote: \"On the 6th October, the whole Wallonia was under the Provisional Government's control. In the Flemish part of the country the collapse of the Royal Government was as total and quick as in Wallonia, except Ghent and Antwerp.\" Robert Demoulin, who was professor at the University of Li\u00e8ge, wrote: \"Li\u00e8ge is in the forefront of the battle for liberty\", more than Brussels but with Brussels. He wrote the same thing for Leuven. According to Demoulin, these three cities are the \"r\u00e9publiques municipales\" at the head of the Belgian revolution. In this chapter VI of his book, \"Le soul\u00e8vement national\" (pp.\u00a093\u2013117), before writing \"On the 6th October, the whole Wallonia is free\", he quotes the following municipalities from which volunteers were going to Brussels, the \"centre of the commotion\", in order to take part in the battle against the Dutch troops: Tournai, Namur, Wavre (p.\u00a0105) Braine-l'Alleud, Genappe, Jodoigne, Perwez, Rebecq, Grez-Doiceau, Limelette, Nivelles (p.\u00a0106), Charleroi (and its region), Gosselies, Lodelinsart (p.\u00a0107), Soignies, Leuze, Thuin, Jemappes (p.\u00a0108), Dour, Saint-Ghislain, P\u00e2turages (p.\u00a0109) and he concluded: \"So, from the Walloon little towns and countryside, people came to the capital..\" The Dutch fortresses were liberated in Ath ( 27 September), Mons (29 September), Tournai (2 October), Namur (4 October) (with the help of people coming from Andenne, Fosses, Gembloux), Charleroi (5 October) (with people who came in their thousands).The same day that was also the case for Philippeville, Mariembourg, Dinant, Bouillon. In Flanders, the Dutch troops capitulated at the same time in Bruges, Ypres, Ostend, Menen, Oudenaarde, Geeraardsbergen (pp.\u00a0113\u2013114), but nor in Ghent nor in Antwerp (only liberated on 17 October and 27 October).\nAgainst these interpretation, in any case for the troubles in Brussels, John W. Rooney Jr wrote: It is clear from the quantitative analysis that an overwhelming majority of revolutionaries were domiciled in Brussels or in the nearby suburbs and that the aid came from outside was minimal. For example, for the day of 23 September, 88% of dead and wounded lived in Brussels identified and if we add those residing in Brabant, it reached 95%. It is true that if you look at the birthplace of revolutionary given by the census, the number of Brussels falls to less than 60%, which could suggest that there was support \"national\" (to different provinces Belgian), or outside the city, more than 40%.But it is nothing, we know that between 1800 and 1830 the population of the capital grew by 75,000 to 103,000, this growth is due to the designation in 1815 in Brussels as a second capital of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the rural exodus that accompanied the Industrial Revolution. It is therefore normal that a large part of the population of Brussels be originating provinces. These migrants came mainly from Flanders, which was hit hard by the crisis in the textile 1826-1830. This interpretation is also nationalist against the statements of witnesses: Charles Rogier said that there were neither in 1830 nor nation Belgian national sentiment within the population. The revolutionary Jean-Baptiste Nothomb ensures that \"the feeling of national unity is born today.\" As for Joseph Lebeau, he said that \"patriotism Belgian is the son of the revolution of 1830..\" Only in the following years as bourgeois revolutionary will \"legitimize ideological state power.\nIn the Belgian State.\nA few years after the Belgian revolution in 1830, the historian Louis Dewez underlined that \"Belgium is shared into two people, Walloons and Flemings. The former are speaking French, the latter are speaking Flemish. The border is clear (...) The provinces which are back the Walloon line, i.e.: the Province of Li\u00e8ge, the Brabant wallon, the Province of Namur, the Province of Hainaut are Walloon [...] And the other provinces throughout the line [...] are Flemish. It is not an arbitrarian division or an imagined combination in order to support an opinion or create a system: it is a fact...\" Jules Michelet traveled in Wallonia in 1840 and mentions many times in his \"History of France\" his interest for Wallonia and the Walloons (this page on the Culture of Wallonia), 476 (1851 edition published online)\nRelationship with the German-speaking community.\nThe Walloon Region institutionally comprises also the German-speaking community of Belgium around Eupen, in the east of the region, next to Germany which ceded the area to Belgium after the First World War. Many of the 60,000 or so inhabitants of this very small community reject being considered as Walloon and \u2013 with their community executive leader Karl-Heinz Lambertz want to remain a federating unit, and to have all the powers of the Belgian Regions and Communities. Even if they do not want them absolutely and immediately (10 July 2008, official speech for the Flanders' national holiday).\nWalloon diaspora.\nWalloons in Germany.\nSince the 11th century, the great towns along the river Meuse, for example, Dinant, Huy, and Li\u00e8ge, traded with Germany, where \"Wallengassen\" (Walloons' neighborhoods) were founded in certain cities. In Cologne, the Walloons were the most important foreign community, as noted by three roads named \"Walloonstreet\" in the city. The Walloons traded for materials they lacked, such as copper, found in Germany, especially at Goslar. New Walloon immigrants settled in several cities in the late 17th century, including Magdeburg and Cottbus.\nWalloons in Poland.\nWalloons were one of the first foreign immigrant groups in Poland, with Walloons settling in Wroc\u0142aw probably since the 12th century, however, the first written mention of Walloon immigrants in Wroc\u0142aw comes from c.\u20091270. In the 12th century, Walloon brothers Aleksander and Walter from Malonne served as Catholic bishops of P\u0142ock and Wroc\u0142aw in Poland, respectively, and there is a possibility that it was Bishop Walter who brought the first Walloon settlers to Poland. In the early 13th century Duke Henry the Bearded invited further Walloon immigrants to the area of O\u0142awa and Wierzbno to the south of Wroc\u0142aw, and some descendants of Walloons from Wroc\u0142aw also moved to O\u0142awa, Wierzbno, and Krak\u00f3w. The guild of Walloon clothiers in Wroc\u0142aw ceased to exist after 1422.\nWalloons in Transylvania.\nIn the 13th century, the medieval German colonization of Transylvania, then part of the Kingdom of Hungary, now central and north-western Romania, also included numerous Walloons. Place names such as \"Wallendorf\" (Walloon Village) and family names such as \"Valendorfean\" (Wallon peasant) can be found among the Romanian citizens of Transylvania.\nWalloons in Sweden.\nStarting from the 1620s, numerous Walloon miners and iron-workers, with their families, settled in Sweden to work in iron mining and refining. Walloon methods of iron production were incorporated into Swedish practice, to supplement the existing German techniques. Many Walloon workers settled around the mine at Dannemora producing \u00d6regrund iron which represented 15 per cent of Sweden's iron production at that time.\nThey were originally led by the entrepreneur Louis de Geer, who commissioned them to work in the iron mines of Uppland and \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland. The wave of migration continued substantially into the 18th century. Walloon ancestry is traceable through Walloon surnames. Some people of Walloon descent belong to the \"S\u00e4llskapet Vallon\u00e4ttlingar\" (Society of Walloon Descendants).\nWalloons in Finland.\nDuring the 17th century Walloons from Sweden started arriving in Finland, during which Finland was part of Sweden. Some also came directly from Wallonia. Most of them settled along the coast in ironworks. Many of the ironworks in Finland were established by Walloons. Walloons largely used the same methods as in Sweden, although Walloon forging was not used, instead Walloon smiths used the German method. As in Sweden, the Walloon population in Finland eventually integrated to the wider society. Former Finnish prime minister Paavo Lipponen is of Walloon descent.\nWalloon culture.\nThe Manifesto for Walloon culture in 1983 was a major event of the History of Wallonia quoted in the important books about the region's history.\nFamous Walloons.\nThis list includes people from the region before it became known as Wallonia.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 1945 as a prisoner of war, Hennig began work on his theory of cladistics, which he published in German in 1950, with a substantially revised English translation published in 1966. With his works on evolution and systematics he revolutionised the view of the natural order of beings. As a taxonomist, he specialised in dipterans (true flies).\nHennig coined the key terms synapomorphy, symplesiomorphy, and paraphyly. He also asserted, in his \"auxiliary principle\", that \"the presence of apomorphous characters in different species 'is always reason for suspecting kinship [i.e., that species belong to a monophyletic group], and that their origin by convergence should not be presumed a priori' (Hennig, 1953). This was based on the conviction that 'phylogenetic systematics would lose all ground on which it stands' if the presence of apomorphous characters in different species were considered first of all as convergences (or parallelisms), with proof to the contrary required in each case.\" This has been viewed as an application of the parsimony principle to the interpretation of characters, an important component of phylogenetic inference.\nHe is also remembered for Hennig's progression rule in cladistics, which argues controversially that the most primitive species are found in the earliest, central part of a group's area.\nBiography.\nEarly years and studies.\nHennig was born in D\u00fcrrhennersdorf, Upper Lusatia. His mother Marie Emma, n\u00e9e Gro\u00df, worked as a maid and, later, factory worker. His father Karl Ernst Emil Hennig was a rail worker. Willi had two brothers, Fritz Rudolf Hennig, who became a minister, and Karl Herbert, who went missing at the Battle of Stalingrad in 1943.\nIn the spring of 1919, Willi Hennig started school in D\u00fcrrhennersdorf, and subsequently was at school in Taubenheim an der Spree and Oppach. Rudolf Hennig described the family as calm; his father possessed an even temperament.\nAs of 1927, Willi Hennig continued his education at the Realgymnasium and boarding school in Klotzsche near Dresden. Here he met his first mentor M. Rost, a science teacher, whom he lived with in a house known as the \"Abteilung\". Rost had an interest in insects and introduced Hennig to Wilhelm Meise, who worked as a scientist at the Dresdener Museum f\u00fcr Tierkunde (State Museum of Zoology, Dresden). In 1930, Hennig skipped a year, and graduated on 26 February 1932. As early as 1931, Willi Hennig composed an essay entitled \"Die Stellung der Systematik in der Zoologie\" (\"The state of systematics in zoology\") as part of his school work, published posthumously in 1978. It showed his interest as well as his deliberate treatment of systematic problems. Besides school, Hennig worked as a volunteer at the museum and, in collaboration with Meise, saw to the systematic and biogeographical investigation of the \"flying\" snakes of the genus \"Dendrophis\" that became his first published work.\nFrom the summer semester of 1932 onwards, Hennig read zoology, botany and geology at the University of Leipzig. He would continue to visit the Museum in Dresden. There, he met the curator of the entomological collection, the Dipteran expert Fritz Isidor van Emden. Hennig saw him regularly until van Emden was expelled from National Socialist Germany for having a Jewish mother and wife.\nHennig developed a deep friendship with Emden's successor, Klaus G\u00fcnther. Hennig concluded his studies with a dissertation entitled, \"\". By this time, Hennig had published eight scientific papers. Besides his 300-page revision of the \"Tylidae\" (now classed as Micropezidae), there were further papers on Diptera and the agamid genus \"Draco\" of gliding lizards. After his studies, Hennig was Volont\u00e4r at the State Museum for Zoology in Dresden. On 1 January 1937, he obtained a scholarship from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) to work at the German Entomological Institute of the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gesellschaft in Berlin-Dahlem. On 13 May 1939, Hennig married his former fellow student Irma Wehnert. By 1945, they had three sons, Wolfgang (born 1941), Bernd (born 1943) and Gerd (born 1945).\nAs a military entomologist.\nWilli Hennig was drafted in 1938 to train for the infantry and concluded this course in 1939. As of the start of World War II, he was deployed in the infantry in Poland, France, Denmark and Russia. He was injured by grenade shrapnel in 1942 and was subsequently used as entomologist at the Institute for Tropical Medicine and Hygiene in Berlin, carrying the rank of a Sonderf\u00fchrer (Z). Just before the war ended, he was sent to Italy to the 10th Army, Heeresgruppe C, to fight malaria and other epidemic diseases. At the end of the war in May 1945, he was captured by the British while he was with the Malaria training corps at the Gulf of Trieste, and was only released in the autumn.\nThrough his active participation in war as soldier and scientist Hennig was later subjected to accusations that he had been a member of the National Socialist party, especially by the Italian biologist and founder of panbiogeography, Leon Croizat. No evidence has been officially presented to support the claim. There is no report of Hennig supporting the National Socialist party views publicly on any occasion. Hennig did believe that Nazi Germany would win World War II.\nDuring his time as prisoner of war, Hennig began to draft his most important contribution to systematics, not published until 1950. The rough draft was composed with pencil and ballpoint pen into an A4 exercise book, spanning 170 pages. During the war, he also published a further 25 scientific papers. Most of the correspondence and literature research was conducted by his wife, Irma.\n1950s: \"Basic outline of a theory of phylogenetic systematics\".\nFrom 1 December 1945, to 31 March 1947, Willi Hennig stood in for his thesis supervisor Paul Buchner as assistant to Professor Friedrich Hempelmann at the University of Leipzig, giving lectures in general biology, zoology and special zoology of insects. He returned to the German Entomological Institute in Berlin on 1 April 1947, and gave up his position in Leipzig. From 1 November 1949, he led the section for systematic entomology and was second director of the institute. On 1 August 1950, he habilitated in zoology at the Brandenburgische Landeshochschule in Potsdam. On 10 October that year he was offered a professorship with teaching responsibilities, which he fulfilled lecturing on special zoology of invertebrates, systematic zoology and taxonomic practicals. In the same year, he published his \"Basic outline of a theory of phylogenetic systematics\", and further works on the methodology of phylogenetic systematics followed in the ensuing years, accompanied by numerous taxonomic works about Diptera. His two-volume \"Pocket book of zoology\", in which he applied phylogenetic systematics to invertebrates for the first time, was particularly successful.\nHe continued working at the German Entomological Institute in the Soviet Sector of Berlin, Berlin-Friedrichshagen, all the while living in the American sector in Berlin-Steglitz. On a trip to France with his son on 13 August 1961, he heard of the impending Berlin Wall and returned to Berlin immediately to quit his appointment. Moving to East Berlin was out of the question, as Hennig held anti-communist views and already had a troubled relationship with the Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands (Socialist Unity Party of Germany, SED) that was the ruling political party of East Germany, as Hennig had repeatedly helped employees of the institute gain employment in the West.\n1961 to 1976.\nIn West Berlin, Hennig was given an interim post at the Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin as Distinguished Professor. He rejected offers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Washington, D.C., and an offer made by his friend Elmo Hardy, to become a Research Fellow at the University of Hawai\u02bbi in Honolulu, citing as reasons that the education of his sons took priority for him, and that he needed to have the \"cultural witnesses of the antique Greek-Roman Europe within ready access\". He instead decided on a post at the State Museum of Natural History in Stuttgart, where he was given a department for phylogenetic research. In April 1963, he moved to Ludwigsburg-Pflugfelden for this position. The scientific collections of the museum had been provisorily kept in Ludwigsburg and remained here until their re-housing at the new site of the museum at Stuttgart's L\u00f6wentor, in 1985.\nHennig's works in Stuttgart dealt almost exclusively with taxonomic revisions of Dipterans. For the \"Stuttgarter Beitr\u00e4ge zur Naturkunde\", where he published the majority of his works, he completed 29 issues by the end of his life. Significant are the review articles published in Erwin Lindner's \"Flies of the Palaearctic Regions\" and the \"Handbuch der Zoologie\". The cladistic methodology was also represented in several published works, foremost among them the article, \"Cladistic analysis or cladistic classification? A reply to Ernst Mayr\" (1974), intended as an internationally accessible reply to the criticism Ernst Mayr had made of Hennig's phylogenetic systematics.\nWilli Hennig only visited international institutions abroad twice, in spite of receiving many invitations for guest lectures. From 1 September to 30 November 1967, he worked at the Entomology Research Institute at Canada's Department of Agriculture in Ottawa and participated in the International Congress of Entomology in Canberra from 22 to 30 August 1972. With his wife, he also visited Bangkok, New Guinea (where much of Mayr's understanding of bird taxonomy originated) and Singapore on this latter trip. His stay in Canada was also used for visits to various entomological collections in museums of the US, including Cambridge, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and New York, always in the hope of finding further amber inclusions of Dipterans, that featured prominently in his research of the late 1960s and early 1970s. On the initiative of Klaus G\u00fcnther, who by then held a chair at the Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Hennig was given an honorary doctorate on 4 December 1968; for health reasons, he could not accept this honour in person, and it was presented to him by G\u00fcnther on 21 March 1969, in Stuttgart. On the initiative of students whom he had lectured on several animal taxa, Hennig was made an honorary professor at the University of T\u00fcbingen on 27 February 1970.\nOn the night of 5 November 1976, Hennig died of a heart attack at Ludwigsburg. He had previously repeatedly cancelled lectures with reference to his fading health, and had already had an attack on his journey to Ottawa. He was interred on 10 November at the Bergfriedhof in T\u00fcbingen.\nThe dipteran genus \"Hennigiola\" is named after him, as is the Evaniid wasp \"Hyptia hennigi\".\nLegacy.\nThe Willi Hennig Society, an organization devoted to the advancement of cladistic principles in systematic biology, was founded in 1981. The society publishes the journal \"Cladistics\".\nA symposium, \"Willi Hennig (1913-1976): His Life, Legacy and the Future of Phylogenetic Systematics\", was held in London by the Linnean Society of London on 27 November 2013. A symposium volume was published in 2016 by the Systematics Association.\nSelected works.\nBooks:\nArticles:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He also was Chancellor of the Exchequer four times, for more than 12 years. Gladstone was also Leader of the House of Commons. He was a Member of Parliament (MP) for 60 years, from 1832 to 1845 and from 1847 to 1895; during that time he represented a total of five constituencies.\nGladstone was born in Liverpool to Scottish parents. He first entered the House of Commons in 1832, beginning his political career as a High Tory, a grouping that became the Conservative Party under Robert Peel in 1834. Gladstone served as a minister in both of Peel's governments, and in 1846 joined the breakaway Peelite faction, which eventually merged into the new Liberal Party in 1859. He was chancellor under Lord Aberdeen (1852\u20131855), Lord Palmerston (1859\u20131865) and Lord Russell (1865\u20131866). Gladstone's own political doctrine\u00a0\u2013 which emphasised equality of opportunity and opposition to trade protectionism\u00a0\u2013 came to be known as Gladstonian liberalism. His popularity among the working-class earned him the sobriquet \"The People's William\".\nIn 1868, Gladstone became prime minister for the first time. Many reforms were passed during his first ministry, including the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland and the introduction of secret voting. After electoral defeat in 1874, Gladstone resigned as leader of the Liberal Party. From 1876 he began a comeback based on opposition to the Ottoman Empire's reaction to the Bulgarian April Uprising. His Midlothian Campaign of 1879\u20131880 was an early example of many modern political campaigning techniques. After the 1880 general election, Gladstone formed his second ministry (1880\u20131885), which saw the passage of the Third Reform Act as well as crises in Egypt (culminating in the Fall of Khartoum) and Ireland, where his government passed repressive measures but also improved the legal rights of Irish tenant farmers.\nBack in office in early 1886, Gladstone proposed home rule for Ireland but was defeated in the House of Commons. The resulting split in the Liberal Party helped keep them out of office\u00a0\u2013 with one short break\u00a0\u2013 for 20 years. Gladstone formed his last government in 1892, at the age of 82. The Government of Ireland Bill 1893 passed through the Commons but was defeated in the House of Lords in 1893, after which Irish Home Rule became a lesser part of his party's agenda. Gladstone left office in March 1894, aged 84, as both the oldest person to serve as prime minister and the only prime minister to have served four non-consecutive terms. He left Parliament in 1895 and died three years later.\nGladstone was known affectionately by his supporters as \"The People's William\" or the \"G.O.M.\" (\"Grand Old Man\", or, to political rivals \"God's Only Mistake\"). Historians often rank Gladstone as one of the greatest prime ministers in British history.\nEarly life.\nBorn on 29 December 1809 at 62 Rodney Street in Liverpool, William Ewart Gladstone was the fourth son of Sir John Gladstone, a wealthy Scottish merchant, slave owner, planter and Tory politician; and his second wife, Anne MacKenzie Robertson. He was named after a close friend of his father, William Ewart, another Liverpool merchant and the father of William Ewart, later a Liberal politician. In 1835, the family name was changed from Gladstones to Gladstone by royal licence. His father was made a baronet, of Fasque and Balfour, in 1846.\nAlthough born and raised in Liverpool, William Gladstone was of purely Scottish ancestry. His grandfather Thomas Gladstones was a prominent merchant from Leith, and his maternal grandfather, Andrew Robertson, was Provost of Dingwall and a Sheriff-Substitute of Ross-shire. His biographer John Morley described him as \"a highlander in the custody of a lowlander\", and an adversary as \"an ardent Italian in the custody of a Scotsman\". One of his earliest childhood memories was being made to stand on a table and say \"Ladies and gentlemen\" to the assembled audience, probably at a gathering to promote the election of George Canning as MP for Liverpool in 1812. In 1814, young \"Willy\" visited Scotland for the first time, as he and his brother John travelled with their father to Edinburgh, Biggar and Dingwall to visit their relatives. Willy and his brother were both made freemen of the burgh of Dingwall. In 1815, Gladstone also travelled to London and Cambridge for the first time with his parents. While in London, he attended a service of thanksgiving with his family at St Paul's Cathedral following the Battle of Waterloo, where he saw the Prince Regent.\nWilliam Gladstone was educated from 1816 to 1821 at a preparatory school at the vicarage of St. Thomas' Church at Seaforth, close to his family's residence, Seaforth House. In 1821, William followed in the footsteps of his elder brothers and attended Eton College before matriculating in 1828 at Christ Church, Oxford, where he read Classics and Mathematics, although he had no great interest in the latter subject. In December 1831, he achieved the double first-class degree he had long desired. Gladstone served as President of the Oxford Union, where he developed a reputation as an orator, which followed him into the House of Commons. At university, Gladstone was a Tory and denounced Whig proposals for parliamentary reform in a famous debate at the Oxford Union in May 1831. On the second day of the three-day debate on the Whig Reform Bill Gladstone moved the motion:\nThat the Ministry has unwisely introduced, and most unscrupulously forwarded, a measure which threatens not only to change the form of our Government, but ultimately to break up the very foundations of social order, as well as materially to forward the views of those who are pursuing the project throughout the civilised world.\nGladstone's 45-minute speech made a great impression on those present and his Amendment carried 94 votes to 38. Among those impressed was Lord Lincoln, who told his father the Duke of Newcastle about it, and it was through this recommendation that the Duke offered Gladstone the safe seat of Newark which he then controlled. \nFollowing the success of his double first, William travelled with his brother John on a Grand Tour of western Europe.\nAlthough Gladstone entered Lincoln's Inn in 1833, with intentions of becoming a barrister, by 1839 he had requested that his name should be removed from the list because he no longer intended to be called to the Bar.\nIn September 1842 he lost the forefinger of his left hand in an accident while reloading a gun. Thereafter he wore a glove or finger sheath (stall).\nHouse of Commons.\nFirst term.\nWhen Gladstone was 22 the Duke of Newcastle, a Conservative party activist, provided him with one of two seats at Newark where he controlled about a fourth of the very small electorate. The Duke spent thousands of pounds entertaining the voters. Gladstone displayed remarkably strong technique as a campaigner and stump speaker. He won his seat at the 1832 United Kingdom general election with 887 votes. After new bills to protect child workers were proposed following the publication of the Sadler report, he voted against the 1833 Factory Acts that would regulate the hours of work and welfare of minors employed in cotton mills.\nOpposition to the opium trade.\nGladstone was an intense opponent of the opium trade. Referring to the opium trade between British India and Qing China, Gladstone described it as \"infamous and atrocious\". Gladstone emerged as a fierce critic of the Opium Wars, which Britain waged to re-legalise the British opium trade into China, which had been made illegal by the Chinese government. He publicly lambasted the wars as \"Palmerston's Opium War\" and said that he felt \"in dread of the judgements of God upon England for our national iniquity towards China\" in May 1840. A famous speech was made by Gladstone in Parliament against the First Opium War. Gladstone criticised it as \"a war more unjust in its origin, a war more calculated in its progress to cover this country with permanent disgrace\". His hostility to opium stemmed from the effects of opium upon his sister Helen. Before 1841, Gladstone was reluctant to join the Peel government because of the First Opium War, which Palmerston had brought on.\nMinister under Peel (1841\u20131846).\nGladstone was re-elected in 1841. In the second ministry of Robert Peel, he served as President of the Board of Trade (1843\u20131845).\nGladstone was responsible for the Railway Regulation Act 1844 (7 &amp; 8 Vict. c. 85), regarded by historians as the birth of the regulatory state, of network industry regulation, of rate of return regulation, and telegraph regulation. Examples of its foresight are the clauses empowering the government to take control of railways in times of war, the concept of Parliamentary trains, limited in cost to a penny a mile, of universal service, and of control of the recently invented electric telegraph which ran alongside railway lines. Railways were the largest investment (as a percentage of GNP) in human history and this bill the most heavily lobbied in parliamentary history. Gladstone succeeded in guiding the Act through Parliament at the height of the railway bubble.\nGladstone became concerned with the situation of \"coal whippers\". These were the men who worked on London docks, \"whipping\" in baskets from ships to barges or wharves all incoming coal from the sea. They were called up and relieved through public houses, so a man could not get this job unless he had the favourable opinion of the publican, who looked most favourably upon those who drank. The man's name was written down and the \"score\" followed. Publicans issued employment solely on the capacity of the man to pay, and men were often drunk when they left the pub to work. They spent their savings on drinks to secure the favourable opinion of publicans and further employment.\nGladstone initiated the Coal Vendors Act 1843 (6 &amp; 7 Vict. c. 2), which set up a central office for employment. When that act expired in 1856, a select committee was appointed by the Lords in 1857 to look into the question. Gladstone gave evidence to the committee, stating:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"I approached the subject in the first instance as I think everyone in Parliament of necessity did, with the strongest possible prejudice against the proposal [to interfere]; but the facts stated were of so extraordinary and deplorable a character, that it was impossible to withhold attention from them. Then the question being whether legislative interference was required I was at length induced to look at a remedy of an extraordinary character as the only one I thought applicable to the case\u00a0... it was a great innovation\".\nLooking back in 1883, Gladstone wrote that \"In principle, perhaps my Coalwhippers Act of 1843 was the most Socialistic measure of the last half century\".\nHe resigned in 1845 over the Maynooth Grant issue, which was a matter of conscience for him. To improve relations with the Catholic Church, Peel's government proposed increasing the annual grant paid to the Maynooth Seminary for training Catholic priests in Ireland. Gladstone, who had previously argued in a book that a Protestant country should not pay money to other churches, nevertheless supported the increase in the Maynooth grant and voted for it in Commons, but resigned rather than face charges that he had compromised his principles to remain in office. After accepting Gladstone's resignation, Peel confessed to a friend, \"I really have great difficulty sometimes in exactly comprehending what he means\". In December 1845, Gladstone returned to Peel's government as Colonial Secretary. The \"Dictionary of National Biography\" notes: \"As such, he had to stand for re-election, but the strong protectionism of the Duke of Newcastle, his patron in Newark, meant that he could not stand there and no other seat was available. Throughout the corn law crisis of 1846, therefore, Gladstone was in the highly anomalous and possibly unique position of being a secretary of state without a seat in either house and thus unanswerable to parliament.\"\nReturn to the backbenches (1846\u20131851).\nWhen Peel's government fell in 1846, Gladstone and other Peel loyalists followed their leader in separating from the protectionist Conservatives; instead offering tentative support to the new Whig prime minister Lord John Russell, with whom Peel had cooperated over the repeal of the Corn Laws. After Peel's death in 1850, Gladstone emerged as the leader of the Peelites in the House of Commons. He was re-elected for the University of Oxford (i.e. representing the MA graduates of the university) at the General Election in 1847\u00a0\u2013 Peel had once held the seat but had lost it because of his espousal of Catholic Emancipation in 1829. Gladstone became a constant critic of Lord Palmerston.\nIn 1847, Gladstone helped to establish Glenalmond College, then The Holy and Undivided Trinity College at Glenalmond. The school was set up as an episcopal foundation to spread the ideas of Anglicanism in Scotland, and to educate the sons of the gentry.\nAs a young man, Gladstone had treated his father's estate, Fasque, in Kincardineshire, southwest of Aberdeen, as home but, as a younger son, he would not inherit it. Instead, from the time of his marriage, he lived at his wife's family's estate at Hawarden in Flintshire, Wales. He never owned Hawarden, which belonged first to his brother-in-law Sir Stephen Glynne, and was then inherited by Gladstone's eldest son in 1874. During the late 1840s, when he was out of office, he worked extensively to turn Hawarden into a viable business.\nIn 1848, he founded the Church Penitentiary Association for the Reclamation of Fallen Women. In May 1849, he began his most active \"rescue work\", and met prostitutes late at night on the street, in his house or in their houses, writing their names in a private notebook. He aided the House of Mercy at Clewer near Windsor, which exercised extreme in-house discipline, and spent much time arranging employment for ex-prostitutes. In a \"Declaration\" signed on 7 December 1896, and only to be opened after his death, Gladstone wrote, \"I desire to record my solemn declaration and assurance, as in the sight of God and before His Judgement Seat, that at no period of my life have I been guilty of the act which is known as that of infidelity to the marriage bed.\"\nIn 1850\u201351, Gladstone visited Naples, Italy, for the benefit of his daughter Mary's eyesight. Giacomo Lacaita, a legal adviser to the British embassy, was at the time imprisoned by the Neapolitan government, as were other political dissidents. Gladstone became concerned about the political situation in Naples, and the arrest and imprisonment of Neapolitan liberals. In February 1851, Gladstone visited the prisons where thousands of them were held, and was outraged. In April and July, he published two \"Letters to the Earl of Aberdeen\", criticising the Neapolitan government and, in 1852, responded to his critics in \"An Examination of the Official Reply of the Neapolitan Government\". Gladstone's first letter described what he saw in Naples as \"the negation of God erected into a system of government\".\nChancellor of the Exchequer (1852\u20131855).\nIn 1852, following the appointment of Lord Aberdeen as prime minister, head of a coalition of Whigs and Peelites, Gladstone became Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Whig Sir Charles Wood and the Tory Disraeli had both been perceived to have failed in the office and so this provided Gladstone with a great political opportunity.\nHis first budget in 1853 almost completed the work begun by Peel eleven years before in simplifying Britain's tariff of duties and customs.123 duties were abolished and 133 duties were reduced. The income tax had legally expired but Gladstone proposed to extend it for seven years to fund tariff reductions:\nWe propose, then, to re-enact it for two years, from April 1853 to April 1855, at the rate of 7d. in the \u00a3; from April 1855, to enact it for two more years at 6d. in the \u00a3; and then for three years more ... from April 1857, at 5d. Under this proposal, on 5 April 1860, the income tax will by law expire.\nGladstone wanted to maintain a balance between direct and indirect taxation and to abolish income tax. He knew that its abolition depended on a considerable retrenchment in government expenditure. He therefore increased the number of people eligible to pay it by lowering the threshold from \u00a3150 to \u00a3100. The more people that paid income tax, Gladstone believed, the more the public would pressure the government into abolishing it.\nGladstone argued that the \u00a3100 line was \"the dividing line ... between the educated and the labouring part of the community\" and that therefore the income taxpayers and the electorate were to be the same people, who would then vote to cut government expenditure.\nThe budget speech (delivered on 18 April), nearly five hours long, raised Gladstone \"at once to the front rank of financiers as of orators\". Colin Matthew has written that Gladstone \"made finance and figures exciting, and succeeded in constructing budget speeches epic in form and performance, often with lyrical interludes to vary the tension in the Commons as the careful exposition of figures and argument was brought to a climax\".\nThe contemporary diarist Charles Greville wrote of Gladstone's speech:\n... by universal consent it was one of the grandest displays and most able financial statement that ever was heard in the House of Commons; a great scheme, boldly, skilfully, and honestly devised, disdaining popular clamour and pressure from without, and the execution of it absolute perfection. Even those who do not admire the Budget, or who are injured by it, admit the merit of the performance. It has raised Gladstone to a great political elevation, and, what is of far greater consequence than the measure itself, has given the country assurance of a man equal to great political necessities, and fit to lead parties and direct governments.\nDuring wartime, he insisted on raising taxes and not borrowing funds to pay for the war. The goal was to turn wealthy Britons against expensive wars. Britain entered the Crimean War in February 1854, and Gladstone introduced his budget on 6 March. He had to increase expenditure on the military and a vote of credit of \u00a31,250,000 was taken to send a force of 25,000 to the front. The deficit for the year would be \u00a32,840,000 (estimated revenue \u00a356,680,000; estimated expenditure \u00a359,420,000). Gladstone refused to borrow the money needed to rectify this deficit and instead increased income tax by half, from sevenpence to tenpence-halfpenny in the pound (from 2.92% to 4.38%). By May another \u00a36,870,000 was needed for the war and Gladstone raised the income tax from tenpence halfpenny to fourteen pence in the pound to raise \u00a33,250,000. Spirits, malt, and sugar were taxed to raise the rest of the money needed. He proclaimed:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The expenses of a war are the moral check which it has pleased the Almighty to impose upon the ambition and lust of conquest that are inherent in so many nations ... The necessity of meeting from year to year the expenditure which it entails is a salutary and wholesome check, making them feel what they are about, and making them measure the cost of the benefit upon which they may calculate.\nHe served until 1855, a few weeks into Lord Palmerston's first premiership, and resigned along with the rest of the Peelites after a motion was passed to appoint a committee of inquiry into the conduct of the war.\nOpposition (1855\u20131859).\nThe Conservative Leader Lord Derby became Prime Minister in 1858, but Gladstone\u00a0\u2013 who like the other Peelites was still nominally a Conservative\u00a0\u2013 declined a position in his government, opting not to sacrifice his free-trade principles.\nBetween November 1858 and February 1859, Gladstone, on behalf of Lord Derby's government, was made Extraordinary Lord High Commissioner of the Ionian Islands embarking via Vienna and Trieste on a twelve-week mission to the southern Adriatic entrusted with complex challenges that had arisen in connection with the future of the British protectorate of the United States of the Ionian Islands.\nIn 1858, Gladstone took up the hobby of tree felling, mostly of oak trees, an exercise he continued with enthusiasm until he was 81 in 1891. Eventually, he became notorious for this activity, prompting Lord Randolph Churchill to observe: For the purposes of recreation he has selected the felling of trees; and we may usefully remark that his amusements, like his politics, are essentially destructive. Every afternoon the whole world is invited to assist at the crashing fall of some beech or elm or oak. The forest laments in order that Mr Gladstone may perspire.\" Less noticed at the time was his practice of replacing the trees felled by planting new saplings.\nGladstone was a lifelong bibliophile. In his lifetime, he read around 20,000 books, and eventually owned a library of more than 32,000 volumes.\nChancellor of the Exchequer (1859\u20131866).\nIn 1859, Lord Palmerston formed a new mixed government with Radicals included, and Gladstone again joined the government (with most of the other remaining Peelites) as Chancellor of the Exchequer, to become part of the new Liberal Party.\nGladstone inherited a deficit of nearly \u00a35,000,000, with income tax now set at 5d (fivepence). Like Peel, Gladstone dismissed the idea of borrowing to cover the deficit. Gladstone argued that \"In time of peace nothing but dire necessity should induce us to borrow\". Most of the money needed was acquired through raising the income tax to 9d. Usually, not more than two-thirds of a tax imposed could be collected in a financial year so Gladstone therefore imposed the extra four pence at a rate of 8d. during the first half of the year so that he could obtain the additional revenue in one year. Gladstone's dividing line set up in 1853 had been abolished in 1858 but Gladstone revived it, with lower incomes to pay 6\u00bdd. instead of 9d. For the first half of the year, the lower incomes paid 8d. and the higher incomes paid 13d. in income tax.\nOn 12 September 1859 the Radical MP Richard Cobden visited Gladstone, who recorded it in his diary: \"... further conv. with Mr. Cobden on Tariffs &amp; relations with France. We are closely &amp; warmly agreed\". Cobden was sent as Britain's representative to the negotiations with France's Michel Chevalier for a free trade treaty between the two countries. Gladstone wrote to Cobden:\n... the great aim\u00a0\u2013 the moral and political significance of the act, and its probable and desired fruit in binding the two countries together by interest and affection. Neither you nor I attach for the moment any superlative value to this Treaty for the sake of the extension of British trade. ... What I look to is the social good, the benefit to the relations of the two countries, and the effect on the peace of Europe.\nGladstone's budget of 1860 was introduced on 10 February along with the Cobden\u2013Chevalier Treaty between Britain and France that would reduce tariffs between the two countries. This budget \"marked the final adoption of the Free Trade principle, that taxation should be levied for Revenue purposes alone, and that every protective, differential, or discriminating duty ... should be dislodged\". At the beginning of 1859, there were 419 duties in existence. The 1860 budget reduced the number of duties to 48, with 15 duties constituting the majority of the revenue. To finance these reductions in indirect taxation, the income tax, instead of being abolished, was raised to 10d. for incomes above \u00a3150 and at 7d. for incomes above \u00a3100.\nIn 1860 Gladstone intended to abolish the duty on paper\u00a0\u2013 a controversial policy\u00a0\u2013 because the duty traditionally inflated the cost of publishing and hindered the dissemination of radical working-class ideas. Although Palmerston supported the continuation of the duty, using it and income tax revenue to buy arms, a majority of his Cabinet supported Gladstone. The Bill to abolish duties on paper narrowly passed the Commons but was rejected by the House of Lords. No money bill had been rejected by the Lords for more than 200 years, and a furore arose over this vote. The next year, Gladstone included the abolition of paper duty in a consolidated Finance Bill (the first ever) to force the Lords to accept it and accept it they did. The proposal in the Commons of one bill only per session for the national finances was a precedent uniformly followed from that date until 1910, and it has been ever since the rule.\nGladstone steadily reduced Income tax over the course of his tenure as Chancellor. In 1861 the tax was reduced to ninepence (\u00a30\u20130s\u20139d), in 1863 to sevenpence, in 1864 to fivepence and in 1865 to fourpence. Gladstone believed that government was extravagant and wasteful with taxpayers' money and so sought to let money \"fructify in the pockets of the people\" by keeping taxation levels down through \"peace and retrenchment\". In 1859 he wrote to his brother, who was a member of the Financial Reform Association at Liverpool: \"Economy is the first and great article (economy such as I understand it) in my financial creed. The controversy between direct and indirect taxation holds a minor, though important place\". He wrote to his wife on 14 January 1860: \"I am \"certain\", from experience, of the immense advantage of strict account-keeping in early life. It is just like learning the grammar then, which when once learned need not be referred to afterwards\".\nBecause of his actions as Chancellor, Gladstone earned the reputation as the liberator of British trade and the working man's breakfast table, the man responsible for the emancipation of the popular press from \"taxes upon knowledge\" and for placing a duty on the succession of the estates of the rich. Gladstone's popularity rested on his taxation policies which meant to his supporters balance, social equity and political justice. The most significant expression of working-class opinion was at Northumberland in 1862 when Gladstone visited. George Holyoake recalled in 1865:\nWhen Mr Gladstone visited the North, you well remember when word passed from the newspaper to the workman that it circulated through mines and mills, factories and workshops, and they came out to greet the only British minister who ever gave the English people a right because it was just they should have it ... and when he went down the Tyne, all the country heard how twenty miles of banks were lined with people who came to greet him. Men stood in the blaze of chimneys; the roofs of factories were crowded; colliers came up from the mines; women held up their children on the banks that it might be said in after life that they had seen the Chancellor of the People go by. The river was covered like the land. Every man who could ply an oar pulled up to give Mr Gladstone a cheer. When Lord Palmerston went to Bradford the streets were still, and working men imposed silence upon themselves. When Mr Gladstone appeared on the Tyne he heard cheer no other English minister ever heard ... the people were grateful to him, and rough pitmen who never approached a public man before, pressed round his carriage by thousands ... and thousands of arms were stretched out at once, to shake hands with Mr Gladstone as one of themselves.\nWhen Gladstone first joined Palmerston's government in 1859, he had opposed further electoral reform, but he changed his position during Palmerston's last premiership, and by 1865 he was firmly in favour of enfranchising the working classes in towns. The policy caused friction with Palmerston, who strongly opposed enfranchisement. At the beginning of each session, Gladstone would passionately urge the Cabinet to adopt new policies, while Palmerston would fixedly stare at a paper before him. At a lull in Gladstone's speech, Palmerston would smile, rap the table with his knuckles, and interject pointedly, \"Now, my Lords and gentlemen, let us go to business\". Although he personally was not a Nonconformist, and rather disliked them in person, he formed a coalition with the Nonconformists that gave the Liberals a powerful base of support.\nAmerican Civil War.\nPalmerston's government adopted a position of British neutrality throughout the war while declining to recognise the independence of the Confederacy. In October 1862 Gladstone made a speech in Newcastle in which he said that Jefferson Davis and the other Confederate leaders had \"made a nation\", and that the Confederacy seemed certain to succeed in asserting its independence from the North, and that the time might come when it would be the duty of the European powers to \"offer friendly aid in compromising the quarrel.\" The speech caused consternation on both sides of the Atlantic and led to speculation that Britain might be about to recognise the Confederacy. Gladstone was accused of sympathising with the South, a charge he rejected. Gladstone was forced to clarify in the press that his comments in Newcastle had not been intended to signal a change in government policy, but to express his belief that the North's efforts to defeat the South would fail, due to the strength of Southern resistance.\nElectoral reform.\nIn May 1864 Gladstone said that he saw no reason in principle why all mentally able men could not be enfranchised, but admitted that this would only come about once the working classes themselves showed more interest in the subject. Queen Victoria was not pleased with this statement, and an outraged Palmerston considered it a seditious incitement to agitation.\nGladstone's support for electoral reform and disestablishment of the (Anglican) Church of Ireland won support from Nonconformists but alienated him from constituents in his Oxford University seat, and he lost it in the 1865 general election. A month later he stood as a candidate in South Lancashire, where he was elected third MP (South Lancashire at this time elected three MPs). Palmerston campaigned for Gladstone in Oxford because he believed that his constituents would keep him \"partially muzzled\"; many Oxford graduates were Anglican clergymen at that time. A victorious Gladstone told his new constituency, \"At last, my friends, I am come among you; and I am come\u00a0\u2013 to use an expression which has become very famous and is not likely to be forgotten\u00a0\u2013 I am come 'unmuzzled'.\"\nOn Palmerston's death in October, Earl Russell formed his second ministry. Russell and Gladstone (now the senior Liberal in the House of Commons) attempted to pass a reform bill, which was defeated in the Commons because the \"Adullamite\" Whigs, led by Robert Lowe, refused to support it. The Conservatives then formed a ministry, in which after a long parliamentary debate Disraeli passed the Reform Act 1867; Gladstone's proposed bill had been totally outmanoeuvred; he stormed into the chamber, but too late to see his arch-enemy pass the bill. Gladstone was furious; his animus commenced a long rivalry that would only end on Disraeli's death and Gladstone's encomium in the Commons in 1881.\nLeader of the Liberal Party, from 1867.\nLord Russell retired in 1867 and Gladstone became leader of the Liberal Party. In 1868 the Irish Church Resolutions were proposed as a measure to reunite the Liberal Party in government (on the issue of disestablishment of the Church of Ireland\u00a0\u2013 this would be done during Gladstone's First Government in 1869 and meant that Irish Roman Catholics did not need to pay their tithes to the Anglican Church of Ireland). When it was passed, Disraeli took the hint and called a General Election.\nFirst premiership (1868\u20131874).\nIn the next general election in 1868, the South Lancashire constituency had been broken up by the Second Reform Act into two: South East Lancashire and South West Lancashire. Gladstone stood for South West Lancashire and for Greenwich, it being quite common then for candidates to stand in two constituencies simultaneously. To his great surprise he was defeated in South West Lancashire but, by winning in Greenwich, was able to remain in Parliament. He became prime minister for the first time and remained in office until 1874. Evelyn Ashley recorded that he had been felling a tree at Hawarden when brought the news that he was about to be appointed prime minister. He broke off briefly to declare \"My mission is to pacify Ireland\" before resuming his exertions.\nIn the 1860s and 1870s, Gladstonian Liberalism was characterised by a number of policies intended to improve individual liberty and loosen political and economic restraints. First was the minimisation of public expenditure on the premise that the economy and society were best helped by allowing people to spend as they saw fit. Secondly, his foreign policy aimed at promoting peace to help reduce expenditures and taxation and enhance trade. Thirdly, laws that prevented people from acting freely to improve themselves were reformed. When an unemployed miner (Daniel Jones) wrote to him to complain of his unemployment and low wages, Gladstone gave what H.C.G. Matthew has called \"the classic mid-Victorian reply\" on 20 October 1869:\nThe only means which have been placed in my power of 'raising the wages of colliers' has been by endeavouring to beat down all those restrictions upon trade which tend to reduce the price to be obtained for the product of their labour, &amp; to lower as much as may be the taxes on the commodities which they may require for use or for consumption. Beyond this I look to the forethought not yet so widely diffused in this country as in Scotland, &amp; in some foreign lands; &amp; I need not remind you that in order to facilitate its exercise the Government have been empowered by Legislation to become through the Dept. of the P.O. the receivers &amp; guardians of savings.\nGladstone's first premiership instituted reforms in the British Army, civil service, and local government to cut restrictions on individual advancement. The Local Government Board Act 1871 put the supervision of the Poor Law under the Local Government Board (headed by G.J. Goschen) and Gladstone's \"administration could claim spectacular success in enforcing a dramatic reduction in supposedly sentimental and unsystematic outdoor poor relief, and in making, in co-operation with the Charity Organization Society (1869), the most sustained attempt of the century to impose upon the working classes the Victorian values of providence, self-reliance, foresight, and self-discipline\".\nGladstone was associated with the Charity Organization Society's first annual report in 1870. Some leading Conservatives at this time were contemplating an alliance between the aristocracy and the working class against the capitalist class, an idea called the New Social Alliance. At a speech at Blackheath on 28 October 1871, he warned his constituents against these social reformers:\n... they are not your friends, but they are your enemies in fact, though not in intention, who teach you to look to the Legislature for the radical removal of the evils that afflict human life. ... It is the individual mind and conscience, it is the individual character, on which mainly human happiness or misery depends. (Cheers.) The social problems that confront us are many and formidable. Let the Government labour to its utmost, let the Legislature labour days and nights in your service; but, after the very best has been attained and achieved, the question whether the English father is to be the father of a happy family and the centre of a united home is a question which must depend mainly upon himself. (Cheers.) And those who ... promise to the dwellers in towns that every one of them shall have a house and garden in free air, with ample space; those who tell you that there shall be markets for selling at wholesale prices retail quantities\u00a0\u2013 I won't say are impostors, because I have no doubt they are sincere; but I will say they are quacks (cheers); they are deluded and beguiled by a spurious philanthropy, and when they ought to give you substantial, even if they are humble and modest boons, they are endeavouring, perhaps without their own consciousness, to delude you with fanaticism, and offering to you a fruit which, when you attempt to taste it, will prove to be but ashes in your mouths. (Cheers.)\nGladstone instituted the abolition of the sale of commissions in the army: he also instituted the Cardwell Reforms in 1869 that made peacetime flogging illegal. In 1870, his government passed the Irish Land Act and Forster's Education Act. In 1871 his government passed the Trade Union Act allowing trade unions to organise and operate legally for the first time (although picketing remained illegal). Gladstone later counted this reform as one of the most significant of the previous half-century, saying that before its passage the law had effectively \"compelled the British workman to work...in chains.\" In 1871, he instituted the Universities Tests Act. He secured passage of the Ballot Act for secret ballots, and the Licensing Act 1872. In foreign affairs, his over-riding aim was to promote peace and understanding, characterised by his settlement of the \"Alabama\" Claims in 1872 in favour of the Americans. During this time, his government gave the approval to launch the expedition of HMS \"Challenger\" at a time when public interest had turned away from scientific explorations. His leadership also led to the passage of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 restructuring the courts to create the modern High Court and Court of Appeal.\nGladstone unexpectedly dissolved Parliament in January 1874 and called a general election.\nGladstone's proposals went some way to meet working-class demands, such as the realisation of the free breakfast table through repealing duties on tea and sugar, and reform of local taxation which was increasing for the poorer ratepayers. According to the working-class financial reformer Thomas Briggs, writing in the trade unionist newspaper \"The Bee-Hive\", the manifesto relied on \"a much higher authority than Mr. Gladstone...viz., the late Richard Cobden\". The dissolution itself was reported in \"The Times\" on 24 January. On 30 January, the names of the first fourteen MPs for uncontested seats were published. By 9 February a Conservative victory was apparent. In contrast to 1868 and 1880 when the Liberal campaign lasted several months, only three weeks separated the news of the dissolution and the election. The working-class newspapers were so taken by surprise they had little time to express an opinion on Gladstone's manifesto before the election was over. Unlike the efforts of the Conservatives, the organisation of the Liberal Party had declined since 1868 and they had also failed to retain Liberal voters on the electoral register. George Howell wrote to Gladstone on 12 February: \"There is one lesson to be learned from this Election, that is Organization. ... We have lost not by a change of sentiment so much as by want of organised power\". The Liberals received a majority of the vote in each of the constituent countries of the United Kingdom and 189,000 more votes nationally than the Conservatives. However, they obtained a minority of seats in the House of Commons.\nOpposition (1874\u20131880).\nIn the wake of Benjamin Disraeli's victory, Gladstone retired from the leadership of the Liberal party, although he retained his seat in the House.\nAnti-Catholicism.\nGladstone had a complex ambivalence about Catholicism. He was attracted by its international success in majestic traditions. More important, he was strongly opposed to the authoritarianism of its pope and bishops, its profound public opposition to liberalism, and its supposed refusal to distinguish between secular allegiance on the one hand and spiritual obedience on the other.\nIn November 1874, he published the pamphlet \"The Vatican Decrees in their Bearing on Civil Allegiance\", directed at the First Vatican Council's dogmatising Papal Infallibility in 1870, which had outraged him. Gladstone claimed that this decree had placed British Catholics in a dilemma over conflicts of loyalty to the Crown. He urged them to reject papal infallibility as they had opposed the Spanish Armada of 1588. The pamphlet sold 150,000 copies by the end of 1874. Cardinal Manning denied that the council had changed the relation of Catholics to their civil governments, and Archbishop James Roosevelt Bayley, in a letter which was obtained by the \"New York Herald\" and published without Bayley's express permission, called Gladstone's declaration \"a shameful calumny\" and attributed his \"monomania\" to the \"political hari-kari\" he had committed by dissolving Parliament, accusing him of \"putting on 'the cap and bells' and attempting to play the part of Lord George Gordon\" in order to restore his political fortunes. John Henry Newman wrote the \"Letter to the Duke of Norfolk\" in reply to Gladstone's charges that Catholics have \"no mental freedom\" and cannot be good citizens.\nA second pamphlet followed in Feb 1875, a defence of the earlier pamphlet and a reply to his critics, entitled \"Vaticanism: an Answer to Reproofs and Replies\". He described the Catholic Church as \"an Asian monarchy: nothing but one giddy height of despotism, and one dead level of religious subservience\". He further claimed that the Pope wanted to destroy the rule of law and replace it with arbitrary tyranny, and then to hide these \"crimes against liberty beneath a suffocating cloud of incense\".\nOpposition to socialism.\nGladstone was opposed to socialism after 1842 when he heard a socialist lecturer. Lord Kilbracken, one of Gladstone's secretaries, commented:\nThe Liberal doctrines of that time, with their violent anti-socialist spirit and their strong insistence on the gospel of thrift, self-help, settlement of wages by the higgling of the market, and non-interference by the State... I think that Mr. Gladstone was the strongest anti-socialist that I have ever known...It is quite true, as has been often said, that \"we are all socialists up to a certain point\"; but Mr. Gladstone fixed that point lower, and was more vehement against those who went above it, than any other politician or official of my acquaintance. I remember his speaking indignantly to me of the budget of 1874 as \"That socialistic budget of Northcote's,\" merely because of the special relief which it gave to the poorer class of income-tax payers. His strong belief in Free Trade was only one of the results of his deep-rooted conviction that the Government's interference with the free action of the individual, whether by taxation or otherwise, should be kept at an irreducible minimum. It is, indeed, not too much to say that his conception of Liberalism was the negation of Socialism.\nBulgarian Horrors.\nA pamphlet Gladstone published on 6 September 1876, \"Bulgarian Horrors and the Question of the East\", attacked the Disraeli government for its indifference to the Ottoman Empire's violent repression of the Bulgarian April uprising. Gladstone made clear his Anti-Turkism hostility against Turkish people, rather than on the Muslim religion. The Turks he said,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;were, upon the whole, from the black day when they first entered Europe, the one great anti-human specimen of humanity. Wherever they went, a broad line of blood marked the track behind them; and as far as their dominion reached, civilisation disappeared from view. They represented everywhere government by force, as opposed to government by law. For the guide of this life they had a relentless fatalism: for its reward hereafter, a sensual paradise.\nThe historian Geoffrey Alderman has described Gladstone as \"unleashing the full fury of his oratorical powers against Jews and Jewish influence\" during the Bulgarian Crisis (1885\u201388), telling a journalist in 1876 that: \"I deeply deplore the manner in which, what I may call Judaic sympathies, beyond as well as within the circle of professed Judaism, are now acting on the question of the East\". Gladstone similarly refused to speak out against the persecution of Romanian Jews in the 1870s and Russian Jews in the early 1880s. The \"Jewish Chronicle\" attacked Gladstone in 1888, arguing that \"Are we, because there was once a Liberal Party, to bow down and worship Gladstone\u00a0\u2013 the great Minister who was too Christian in his charity, too Russian in his proclivities, to raise voice or finger\" to defend Russian Jews...\nDuring the 1879 election campaign, called the Midlothian campaign, he rousingly denounced Disraeli's foreign policies during the Second Anglo-Afghan War in Afghanistan (see Great Game). He saw the war as \"great dishonour\" and also criticised British conduct in the Zulu War. Gladstone also (on 29 November) condemned what he saw as the Conservative government's profligate spending,\n...the Chancellor of the Exchequer shall boldly uphold economy in detail; and it is the mark ... of ... a chicken-hearted Chancellor of the Exchequer, when he shrinks from upholding economy in detail, when, because it is a question of only \u00a32,000 or \u00a33,000, he says that is no matter. He is ridiculed, no doubt, for what is called saving candle-ends and cheese-parings. No Chancellor of the Exchequer is worth his salt who is not ready to save what are meant by candle-ends and cheese-parings in the cause of his country. No Chancellor of the Exchequer is worth his salt who makes his own popularity either his first consideration, or any consideration at all, in administrating the public purse. You would not like to have a housekeeper or steward who made her or his popularity with the tradesmen the measure of the payments that were to be delivered to them. In my opinion the Chancellor of the Exchequer is the trusted and confidential steward of the public. He is under a sacred obligation with regard to all that he consents to spend... I am bound to say hardly ever in the six years that Sir Stafford Northcote has been in office have I heard him speak a resolute word on behalf of economy.\nSecond premiership (1880\u20131885).\nIn 1880, the Liberals won again and the Liberal leaders, Lord Hartington (leader in the House of Commons) and Lord Granville, retired in Gladstone's favour. Gladstone won his constituency election in Midlothian and also in Leeds, where he had also been adopted as a candidate. As he could lawfully only serve as MP for one constituency, Leeds was passed to his son Herbert. One of his other sons, Henry, was also elected as an MP. Queen Victoria asked Lord Hartington to form a ministry, but he persuaded her to send for Gladstone. Gladstone's second administration\u00a0\u2013 both as Prime Minister and again as Chancellor of the Exchequer until 1882\u00a0\u2013 lasted from June 1880 to June 1885. He originally intended to retire at the end of 1882, the 50th anniversary of his entry into politics, but did not do so.\nForeign policy.\nHistorians have debated the wisdom of Gladstone's foreign policy during his second ministry. Paul Hayes says it \"provides one of the most intriguing and perplexing tales of muddle and incompetence in foreign affairs, unsurpassed in modern political history until the days of Grey and, later, Neville Chamberlain.\" Gladstone opposed himself to the \"colonial lobby\" pushing for the scramble for Africa. His term saw the end of the Second Anglo-Afghan War, the First Boer War, and the war against the Mahdi in Sudan.\nOn 11 July 1882, Gladstone ordered the bombardment of Alexandria, starting the short, Anglo-Egyptian War of 1882. The British won decisively, and although they repeatedly promised to depart in a few years, the actual result was British control of Egypt for four decades, largely ignoring Ottoman nominal ownership. France was seriously unhappy, having lost control of the canal that it built and financed and had dreamed of for decades. Gladstone's role in the decision to invade was described as relatively hands-off, and the ultimate responsibility was borne by certain members of his cabinet such as Lord Hartington, Secretary of State for India; Thomas Baring, 1st Earl of Northbrook, First Lord of the Admiralty; Hugh Childers, Secretary of State for War; and Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville, the Foreign Secretary.\nHistorian A. J. P. Taylor says that the seizure of Egypt \"was a great event; indeed, the only real event in international relations between the Battle of Sedan and the defeat of Russia in the Russo-Japanese war.\"\nTaylor emphasizes long-term impact:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The British occupation of Egypt altered the balance of power. It not only gave the British security for their route to India, it made them masters of the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East. It made it unnecessary for them to stand on the front line against Russia at the Straits...And thus prepared the way for the Franco-Russian Alliance ten years later.\nGladstone and the Liberals had a reputation for strong opposition to imperialism, so historians have long debated the explanation for this reversal of policy. The most influential was a study by John Robinson and Ronald Gallagher, \"Africa and the Victorians\" (1961), which focused on The Imperialism of Free Trade and was promoted by the Cambridge School of historiography. They argue there was no long-term Liberal plan in support of imperialism. Instead, they saw the urgent necessity to act to protect the Suez Canal in the face of what appeared to be a radical collapse of law and order, and a nationalist revolt focused on expelling the Europeans, regardless of the damage it would do to international trade and the British Empire. Gladstone's decision came against strained relations with France and manoeuvring by \"men on the spot\" in Egypt. Critics such as Cain and Hopkins have stressed the need to protect large sums invested by British financiers and Egyptian bonds while downplaying the risk to the viability of the Suez Canal. Unlike the Marxists, they stress \"gentlemanly\" financial and commercial interests, not the industrial capitalism that Marxists believe was always central. More recently, specialists on Egypt have been interested primarily in the internal dynamics among Egyptians that produce the failed Urabi Revolt.\nIreland.\nIn 1881, he established the Irish Coercion Act, which permitted the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland to detain people for as \"long as was thought necessary\", as there was rural disturbance in Ireland between landlords and tenants as Cavendish, the Irish Secretary, had been assassinated by Irish rebels in Dublin. He also passed the Second Land Act (the First, in 1870, had entitled Irish tenants, if evicted, to compensation for improvements which they had made on their property, but had little effect) which gave Irish tenants the \"3Fs\"\u00a0\u2013 fair rent, fixity of tenure and free sale. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1881.\nFranchise.\nGladstone extended the vote to agricultural labourers and others in the 1884 Reform Act, which gave the counties the same franchise as the boroughs\u00a0\u2013 adult male householders and \u00a310 lodgers\u00a0\u2013 and added six million to the total number of people who could vote in parliamentary elections. Parliamentary reform continued with the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885.\nGladstone was increasingly uneasy about the direction in which British politics was moving. In a letter to Lord Acton on 11 February 1885, Gladstone criticised Tory Democracy as \"demagogism\" that \"put down pacific, law-respecting, economic elements that ennobled the old Conservatism\" but \"still, in secret, as obstinately attached as ever to the evil principle of class interests\". He found contemporary Liberalism better, \"but far from being good\". Gladstone claimed that this Liberalism's \"pet idea is what they call construction,\u00a0\u2013 that is to say, taking into the hands of the state the business of the individual man\". Both Tory Democracy and this new Liberalism, Gladstone wrote, had done \"much to estrange me, and had for many, many years\".\nFailure.\nHistorian Sneh Mahajan has concluded that \"Gladstone's second ministry remained barren of any achievement in the domestic sphere\". His downfall came in Africa, where he delayed the mission to rescue General Gordon's force which had been under siege in Khartoum for 10 months. It arrived in January 1885 two days after a massacre killed approximately 7,000 British and Egyptian soldiers and 4,000 civilians. The disaster proved a major blow to Gladstone's popularity. Queen Victoria sent him a telegram of rebuke which found its way into the press. Critics said Gladstone had neglected military affairs and had not acted promptly enough to save the besieged Gordon. Critics inverted his acronym, \"G.O.M.\" (for \"Grand Old Man\"), to \"M.O.G.\" (for \"Murderer of Gordon\"). He resigned as prime minister in June 1885 and declined Queen Victoria's offer of an earldom.\nThird premiership (1886).\nThe Hawarden Kite was a December 1885 press release by Gladstone's son and aide Herbert Gladstone announcing that he had become convinced that Ireland needed a separate parliament. The bombshell announcement resulted in the fall of Lord Salisbury's Conservative government. Irish Nationalists, led by Charles Parnell's Irish Parliamentary Party, held the balance of power in Parliament. Gladstone's conversion to Home Rule convinced them to switch away from the Conservatives and support the Liberals using the 86 seats in Parliament they controlled. The main purpose of this administration was to deliver Ireland a reform that would give it a devolved assembly, similar to those which would eventually be put in place in Scotland and Wales in 1999. In 1886 Gladstone's party allied with Irish Nationalists to defeat Lord Salisbury's government. Gladstone regained his position as prime minister and combined the office with that of Lord Privy Seal. During this administration, he first introduced his Home Rule Bill for Ireland. The issue split the Liberal Party (a breakaway group went on to create the Liberal Unionist party) and the bill was thrown out on the second reading, ending his government after only a few months and inaugurating another headed by Lord Salisbury.\nGladstone, says his biographer, \"totally rejected the widespread English view that the Irish had no taste for justice, common sense, moderation or national prosperity and looked only to perpetual strife and dissension\". The problem for Gladstone was that his rural English supporters would not support Home Rule for Ireland. A large faction of Liberals, led by Joseph Chamberlain, formed a Unionist faction that supported the Conservative party. Whenever the Liberals were out of power, Home Rule proposals languished.\nOpposition (1886\u20131892).\nGladstone supported the London dockers in their strike of 1889. After their victory he gave a speech at Hawarden on 23 September in which he said: \"In the common interests of humanity, this remarkable strike and the results of this strike, which have tended somewhat to strengthen the condition of labour in the face of capital, is the record of what we ought to regard as satisfactory, as a real social advance [that] tends to a fair principle of division of the fruits of industry\". This speech has been described by Eugenio Biagini as having \"no parallel in the rest of Europe except in the rhetoric of the toughest socialist leaders\". Visitors at Hawarden in October were \"shocked...by some rather wild language on the Dock labourers question\". Gladstone was impressed with workers unconnected with the dockers' dispute who \"intended to make common cause\" in the interests of justice.\nOn 23 October at Southport, Gladstone delivered a speech where he said that the right to combination, which in London was \"innocent and lawful, in Ireland would be penal and...punished by imprisonment with hard labour\". Gladstone believed that the right to combination used by British workers was in jeopardy when it could be denied to Irish workers. In October 1890 Gladstone at Midlothian claimed that competition between capital and labour, \"where it has gone to sharp issues, where there have been strikes on one side and lock-outs on the other, I believe that in the main and as a general rule, the labouring man has been in the right\".\nOn 11 December 1891 Gladstone said that: \"It is a lamentable fact if, in the midst of our civilisation, and at the close of the nineteenth century, the workhouse is all that can be offered to the industrious labourer at the end of a long and honourable life. I do not enter into the question now in detail. I do not say it is an easy one; I do not say that it will be solved in a moment; but I do say this, that until society is able to offer to the industrious labourer at the end of a long and blameless life something better than the workhouse, society will not have discharged its duties to its poorer members\". On 24 March 1892, Gladstone said that the Liberals had:\n...come generally...to the conclusion that there is something painful in the condition of the rural labourer in this great respect, that it is hard even for the industrious and sober man, under ordinary conditions, to secure a provision for his own old age. Very large propositions, involving, some of them, very novel and very wide principles, have been submitted to the public, for the purpose of securing such a provision by means independent of the labourer himself...our duty [is] to develop in the first instance, every means that we may possibly devise whereby, if possible, the labourer may be able to make this provision for himself, or to approximate towards making such provision far more efficaciously and much more closely than he can now do. Gladstone wrote on 16 July 1892 in \"autobiographica\" that \"In 1834 the Government...did themselves high honour by the new Poor Law Act, which rescued the English peasantry from the total loss of their independence\". There were many who disagreed with him.\nGladstone wrote to Herbert Spencer, who contributed the introduction to a collection of anti-socialist essays (\"A Plea for Liberty\", 1891), that \"I ask to make reserves, and of one passage, which will be easily guessed, I am unable even to perceive the relevancy. But speaking generally, I have read this masterly argument with warm admiration and with the earnest hope that it may attract all the attention which it so well deserves\". The passage Gladstone alluded to was one where Spencer had spoken of \"the behaviour of the so-called Liberal party\".\nFourth premiership (1892\u20131894).\nThe general election of 1892 resulted in a minority Liberal government with Gladstone as prime minister. The electoral address had promised Irish Home Rule and the disestablishment of the Scottish and Welsh Churches. In February 1893 he introduced the Second Home Rule Bill, which was passed in the Commons at the second reading on 21 April by 43 votes and the third reading on 1 September by 34 votes. The House of Lords defeated the bill by voting against it by 419 votes to 41 on 8 September.\nThe Elementary Education (Blind and Deaf Children) Act, passed in 1893, required local authorities to provide separate education for blind and deaf children.\nConservative MP Colonel Howard Vincent questioned Gladstone in the Commons on what his government would do about unemployment on 1 September 1893. Gladstone replied: I cannot help regretting that the honourable and gallant Gentleman has felt it his duty to put the question. It is put under circumstances that naturally belong to one of those fluctuations in the condition of trade which, however unfortunate and lamentable they may be, recur from time to time. Undoubtedly I think that questions of this kind, whatever be the intention of the questioner, have a tendency to produce in the minds of people or to suggest to the people, that these fluctuations can be corrected by the action of the Executive Government. Anything that contributes to such an impression inflicts an injury upon the labouring population.\nIn December 1893, an Opposition motion proposed by Lord George Hamilton called for an expansion of the Royal Navy. Gladstone opposed increasing public expenditure on the naval estimates, in the tradition of free trade liberalism of his earlier political career as Chancellor. All his Cabinet colleagues believed in some expansion of the navy. He declared in the Commons on 19 December that naval rearmament would commit the government to expenditure over a number of years and would subvert \"the principle of annual account, annual proposition, annual approval by the House of Commons, which...is the only way of maintaining regularity, and that regularity is the only talisman which will secure Parliamentary control\".\n In January 1894, Gladstone wrote that he would not \"break to pieces the continuous action of my political life, nor trample on the tradition received from every colleague who has ever been my teacher\" by supporting naval rearmament. Gladstone also opposed Chancellor Sir William Harcourt's proposal to implement a graduated death duty. In a fragment of autobiography dated 25 July 1894, Gladstone denounced the tax as\n...by far the most Radical measure of my lifetime. I do not object to the principle of graduated taxation: for the just principle of the ability to pay is not determined simply by the amount of income... But, so far as I understand the present measure of finance from the partial reports I have received, I find it too violent. It involves a great departure from the methods of political action established in this country, where reforms, and especially financial reforms, have always been considerate and even tender... I do not yet see the ground on which it can be justly held that any one description of \"property\" should be more heavily burdened than others unless moral and social grounds can be shown first: but in this case, the reasons drawn from those sources seem rather to verge in the opposite direction, for real property has more of presumptive connection with the discharge of duty than that which is ranked as personal...the aspect of the measure is not satisfactory to a man of my traditions (and these traditions lie near the roots of my being)... For the sudden introduction of such change, there is I think no precedent in the history of this country. And the severity of the blow is greatly aggravated in moral effect by the fact that it is dealt only to a handful of individuals.\nGladstone had his last audience with Queen Victoria on 28 February 1894 and chaired his last Cabinet on 1 March\u00a0\u2013 the last of 556 he had chaired. On that day he gave his last speech to the House of Commons, saying that the government would withdraw opposition to the Lords' amendments to the Local Government Bill \"under protest\" and that it was \"a controversy which, when once raised, must go forward to an issue\". He resigned from the premiership on 2 March. The Queen did not ask Gladstone who should succeed him but sent for Lord Rosebery (Gladstone would have advised on Lord Spencer). He retained his seat in the House of Commons until 1895. He was not offered a peerage, having earlier declined an earldom.\nGladstone is both the oldest person to form a government\u00a0\u2013 aged 82 at his appointment\u00a0\u2013 and the oldest person to occupy the Premiership\u00a0\u2013 being 84 at his resignation.\nFinal years (1894\u20131898).\nIn 1895, at the age of 85, Gladstone bequeathed \u00a340,000 (equivalent to approximately \u00a3 today) and much of his 32,000 volume library to found St Deiniol's Library in Hawarden, Wales. It had begun with just 5,000 items at his father's home Fasque, which were transferred to Hawarden for research in 1851.\nOn 8 January 1896, in conversation with L. A. Tollemache, Gladstone explained: \"I am not so much afraid of Democracy or of Science as of the love of money. This seems to me to be a growing evil. Also, there is a danger from the growth of that dreadful military spirit.\" On 13 January, Gladstone claimed he had strong Conservative instincts and that \"In all matters of custom and tradition, even the Tories look upon me as the chief Conservative that is\". On 15 January Gladstone wrote to James Bryce, describing himself as \"a dead man, one fundamentally a Peel\u2013Cobden man\". In 1896, in his last noteworthy speech, he denounced Armenian massacres by Ottomans in a talk delivered at Liverpool. On 2 January 1897, Gladstone wrote to Francis Hirst on being unable to draft a preface to a book on liberalism: \"I venture on assuring you that I regard the design formed by you and your friends with sincere interest, and in particular wish well to all the efforts you may make on behalf of individual freedom and independence as opposed to what is termed Collectivism\".\nIn the early months of 1897, Gladstone and his wife stayed in Cannes. Gladstone met Queen Victoria, and she shook hands with him for (to his recollection) the first time in the 50 years he had known her. One of the Gladstones' neighbours observed that \"He and his devoted wife never missed the morning service on Sunday\u00a0... One Sunday, returning from the altar rail, the old, partially blind man stumbled at the chancel step. One of the clergy sprang involuntarily to his assistance but retreated with haste, so withering was the fire which flashed from those failing eyes.\" The Gladstones returned to Hawarden Castle at the end of March and he received the Colonial Premiers in their visit for the Queen's Jubilee. At a dinner in November with Edward Hamilton, his former private secretary, Hamilton noted that \"What is now uppermost in his mind is what he calls the spirit of jingoism under the name of Imperialism which is now so prevalent\". Gladstone riposted \"It was enough to make Peel and Cobden turn in their graves\".\nOn the advice of his doctor Samuel Habershon in the aftermath of an attack of facial neuralgia, Gladstone stayed at Cannes from the end of November 1897 to mid-February 1898. He gave an interview for \"The Daily Telegraph\". Gladstone then travelled to Bournemouth, where a swelling on his palate was diagnosed as cancer by the leading cancer surgeon Sir Thomas Smith on 18 March. On 22 March, Gladstone retired to Hawarden Castle. Despite being in pain he received visitors and quoted hymns, especially Cardinal Newman's \"Praise to the Holiest in the Height\".\nHis last public statement was dictated to his daughter Helen in reply to receiving the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford's \"sorrow and affection\": \"There is no expression of Christian sympathy that I value more than that of the ancient University of Oxford, the God-fearing and God-sustaining University of Oxford. I served her perhaps mistakenly, but to the best of my ability. My most earnest prayers are hers to the uttermost and to the last\". He left the house for the last time on 9 April. After 18 April he did not come down to the ground floor but still came out of bed to lie on the sofa. The Bishop of St Andrews, Dunkeld and Dunblane George Wilkinson recorded when he ministered to him along with Stephen Gladstone: Shall I ever forget the last Friday in Passion Week, when I gave him the last Holy Communion that I was allowed to administer to him? It was early in the morning. He was obliged to be in bed, and he was ordered to remain there, but the time had come for the confession of sin and the receiving of absolution. Out of his bed he came. Alone he knelt in the presence of his God till the absolution has been spoken, and the sacred elements received.\nGladstone died on 19 May 1898 at Hawarden Castle, aged 88. He had been cared for by his daughter Helen who had resigned from her job to care for her father and mother. The cause of death is officially recorded as \"Syncope, Senility\". \"Syncope\" meant failure of the heart and \"senility\" in the 19th century was an infirmity of advanced old age, rather than a loss of mental faculties. The House of Commons adjourned on the afternoon of Gladstone's death, with A. J. Balfour giving notice for an Address to the Queen praying for a public funeral and a public memorial in Westminster Abbey. The day after, both Houses of Parliament approved the Address and Herbert Gladstone accepted a public funeral on behalf of the Gladstone family. His coffin was transported on the London Underground before his state funeral at Westminster Abbey, at which the Prince of Wales (the future King Edward VII) and the Duke of York (the future King George V) acted as pallbearers. His wife, Catherine Gladstone (\"n\u00e9e\" Glynne), died two years later on 14 June 1900 and was buried next to him.\nReligion.\nGladstone's intensely religious mother was an evangelical of Scottish Episcopal origins, and his father joined the Church of England, having been a Presbyterian when he first settled in Liverpool. As a boy, William was baptised into the Church of England. He rejected a call to enter the ministry, and on this his conscience always tormented him. In compensation, he aligned his politics with the evangelical faith in which he fervently believed. In 1838 Gladstone nearly ruined his career when he tried to force a religious mission upon the Conservative Party. His book \"The State in its Relations with the Church\" argued that England had neglected its great duty to the Church of England. He announced that since that church possessed a monopoly of religious truth, nonconformists and Roman Catholics ought to be excluded from all government positions. The historian Thomas Babington Macaulay and other critics ridiculed his arguments and refuted them. Sir Robert Peel, Gladstone's chief, was outraged because this would upset the delicate political issue of Catholic Emancipation and anger the Nonconformists. Since Peel greatly admired his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, he redirected his focus from theology to finance.\nGladstone altered his approach to religious problems, which always held first place in his mind. Before entering Parliament he had already substituted a high church Anglican attitude, with its dependence on authority and tradition, for the evangelical outlook of his boyhood, with its reliance upon the direct inspiration of the Bible. In middle life, he decided that the individual conscience would have to replace authority as the inner citadel of the Church. That view of the individual conscience affected his political outlook and changed him gradually from a Conservative into a Liberal.\nAttitude towards slavery.\nInitially a disciple of High Toryism, Gladstone's maiden speech as a young Tory was a defence of the rights of West Indian sugar plantation magnates (slave owners) among whom his father was prominent. He immediately came under attack from anti-slavery elements. He also surprised the duke by urging the need to increase pay for unskilled factory workers.\nGladstone's early attitude towards slavery was highly shaped by his father, Sir John Gladstone, one of the largest slave owners in the British Empire. Gladstone wanted gradual rather than immediate emancipation, and proposed that slaves should serve a period of apprenticeship after being freed. They also opposed the international slave trade (which lowered the value of the slaves the father already owned). The anti-slavery movement demanded the immediate abolition of slavery. Gladstone opposed this and said in 1832 that emancipation should come after moral emancipation through the adoption of education and the inculcation of \"honest and industrious habits\" among the slaves. Then \"with the utmost speed that prudence will permit, we shall arrive at that exceedingly desired consummation, the utter extinction of slavery.\" In 1831, when the Oxford Union considered a motion in favour of the immediate emancipation of the slaves in the West Indies, Gladstone moved an amendment in favour of gradual manumission along with better protection for the personal and civil rights of the slaves and better provision for their Christian education. His early Parliamentary speeches followed a similar line: in June 1833, Gladstone concluded his speech on the 'slavery question' by declaring that though he had dwelt on \"the dark side\" of the issue, he looked forward to \"a safe and gradual emancipation\".\nIn 1834, when slavery was abolished across the British Empire, the owners were paid full value for the slaves. Gladstone helped his father obtain \u00a3106,769 () in official reimbursement by the government for the 2,508 slaves he owned across nine plantations in the Caribbean.\nIn later years Gladstone's attitude towards slavery became more critical as his father's influence over his politics diminished. In 1844 Gladstone broke with his father when, as President of the Board of Trade, he advanced proposals to halve duties on foreign sugar not produced by slave labour, in order to \"secure the effectual exclusion of slave-grown sugar\" and to encourage Brazil and Spain to end slavery. Sir John Gladstone, who opposed any reduction in duties on foreign sugar, wrote a letter to \"The Times\" criticizing the measure. Looking back late in life, Gladstone named the abolition of slavery as one of ten great achievements of the previous sixty years where the masses had been right and the upper classes had been wrong.\nShortly after the outbreak of the American Civil War Gladstone wrote to his friend the Duchess of Sutherland that \"the principle announced by the vice-president of the South...which asserts the superiority of the white man, and therewith founds on it his right to hold the black in slavery, I think that principle detestable, and I am wholly with the opponents of it\" but that he felt that the North was wrong to try to restore the Union by military force, which he believed would end in failure.\nIn a memorandum to the Cabinet later that month Gladstone wrote that, although he believed the Confederacy would probably win the war, it was \"seriously tainted by its connection with slavery\" and argued that the European powers should use their influence on the South to effect the \"mitigation or removal of slavery\".\nMarriage and family.\nGladstone's early attempts to find a wife proved unsuccessful; he was rejected in 1835 by Caroline Eliza Farquhar (daughter of Sir Thomas Harvie Farquhar, 2nd Baronet) and again in 1837 by Lady Frances Harriet Douglas (daughter of George Douglas, 17th Earl of Morton).\nOn 25 July 1839, Gladstone was married to Catherine Glynne, whom he had met in 1834 at the London home of Old Etonian friend and then fellow-Conservative MP James Milnes Gaskell. The ceremony was a joint wedding shared with Catherine's sister Mary Glynne and her husband George Lyttelton. \nCatherine and William remained married until Gladstone's death 59 years later and had eight children together:\nGladstone's eldest son William (known as \"Willy\" to distinguish him from his father), and youngest, Herbert, both became Members of Parliament. Henry and Herbert became Peers (a Baron and a Viscount) and so members of the House of Lords. William Henry predeceased his father by seven years. Gladstone's private secretary was his nephew Spencer Lyttelton.\nDescendants.\nTwo of Gladstone's sons and a grandson, William Glynne Charles Gladstone, followed him into parliament, making for four generations of MPs in total. One of his collateral descendants, George Freeman, has been the Conservative Member of Parliament for Mid Norfolk since 2010.\nSir Albert Gladstone, 5th baronet, an Olympic Games rowing champion, and Sir Charles Gladstone, 6th baronet (from whom the 7th and 8th baronets are descended) were also grandsons.\nLegacy.\nThe historian H.C.G. Matthew states that Gladstone's chief legacy lay in three areas: his financial policy, his support for Home Rule (devolution) that modified the view of the unitary state of the United Kingdom and his idea of a progressive, reforming party broadly based and capable of accommodating and conciliating varying interests, along with his speeches at mass public meetings.\nHistorian Walter L. Arnstein concludes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Notable as the Gladstonian reforms had been, they had almost all remained within the 19th-century Liberal tradition of gradually removing the religious, economic and political barriers that prevented men of varied creeds and classes from exercising their individual talents in order to improve themselves and their society. As the third quarter of the century drew to a close, the essential bastions of Victorianism still held firm: respectability; a government of aristocrats and gentlemen now influenced not only by middle-class merchants and manufacturers but also by industrious working people: a prosperity that seemed to rest largely on the tenets of laissez-faire economics; and a Britannia that ruled the waves and many a dominion beyond.\nLord Acton wrote in 1880 that he considered Gladstone one \"of the three greatest Liberals\" (along with Edmund Burke and Lord Macaulay).\nIn 1909 the Liberal Chancellor David Lloyd George introduced his \"People's Budget\", the first budget which aimed to redistribute wealth. The Liberal statesman Lord Rosebery ridiculed it by asserting Gladstone would reject it, \"Because in his eyes, and in my eyes, too as his humble disciple, Liberalism and Liberty were cognate terms; they were twin-sisters.\"\nLloyd George had written in 1913 that the Liberals were \"carving the last few columns out of the Gladstonian quarry\".\nLloyd George said of Gladstone in 1915: \"What a man he was! Head and shoulders above anyone else I have ever seen in the House of Commons. I did not like him much. He hated Nonconformists and Welsh Nonconformists in particular and he had no real sympathy with the working classes. But he was far and away the best Parliamentary speaker I have ever heard. He was not so good in exposition.\" Writing in 1944, the classical liberal economist Friedrich Hayek said of the change in political attitudes that had occurred since the Great War: \"Perhaps nothing shows this change more clearly than that, while there is no lack of sympathetic treatment of Bismarck in contemporary English literature, the name of Gladstone is rarely mentioned by the younger generation without a sneer over his Victorian morality and naive utopianism.\"\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, Thatcherite Conservatives began to claim association with Gladstone and his economic policies. Margaret Thatcher proclaimed in 1983: \"We have a duty to make sure that every penny piece we raise in taxation is spent wisely and well. For it is our party which is dedicated to good housekeeping\u00a0\u2013 indeed, I would not mind betting that if Mr. Gladstone were alive today he would apply to join the Conservative Party.\" In 1996, she said: \"The kind of Conservatism which he and I...favoured would be best described as 'liberal', in the old-fashioned sense. And I mean the liberalism of Mr Gladstone, not of the latter-day collectivists.\" Nigel Lawson, one of Thatcher's Chancellors, called Gladstone the \"greatest Chancellor of all time\".\nA. J. P. Taylor wrote:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;William Ewart Gladstone was the greatest political figure of the nineteenth century. I do not mean by that that he was necessarily the greatest statesman, certainly not the most successful. What I mean is that he dominated the scene.\nRivalry with Disraeli.\nHistorical writers have often played Disraeli and Gladstone against each other as great rivals. Roland Quinault, however, cautions us not to exaggerate the confrontation:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;they were not direct antagonists for most of their political careers. Indeed initially they were both loyal to the Tory party, the Church and the landed interest. Although their paths diverged over the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 and later over fiscal policy more generally, it was not until the later 1860s that their differences over parliamentary reform, Irish and Church policy assumed great partisan significance. Even then their personal relations remained fairly cordial until their dispute over the Eastern Question in the later 1870s.\nStreets in Bulgaria.\nStreets in Sofia, Plovdiv, Kazanlak, Bulgaria are named after him.\nIn popular culture.\nGladstone was popularly known in his later years as the \"Grand Old Man\" or \"G.O.M.\". The term was used occasionally during the Midlothian election campaign, first became widely associated with him during the 1880 general election, and was ubiquitous in the press by 1882. Henry Labouch\u00e8re and Sir Stafford Northcote have both been credited with coining it; it appears to have been in use before either of them used it publicly, though they may have helped popularise it. While it was originally used to show affectionate reverence, it was quickly adopted more sarcastically by his opponents, using it to emphasise his age. The acronym was sometimes satirised as \"God's Only Mistake\", or after the fall of Khartoum, inverted to \"M.O.G.\", \"Murderer of Gordon\". (Disraeli is often credited with the former, but Lord Salisbury is a more likely origin.) The term is still widely used today and is virtually synonymous with Gladstone.\nGladstone's burial in 1898 was commemorated in a poem by William McGonagall.\nPortrayal in film and television.\nSince 1937, Gladstone has been portrayed some 37 times in film and television.\nPortrayals include:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nBiographies.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSpecial studies.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMidlothian campaign.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPrimary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nrole=\"presentation\" class=\"wikitable succession-box noprint\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; font-size:small;clear:both;\""}
{"id": "33955", "revid": "28903366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33955", "title": "WordNet", "text": "Computational lexicon of English\nWordNet is a lexical database of semantic relations between words that links words into semantic relations including synonyms, hyponyms, and meronyms. The synonyms are grouped into \"synsets\" with short definitions and usage examples. It can thus be seen as a combination and extension of a dictionary and thesaurus. Its primary use is in automatic text analysis and artificial intelligence applications. It was first created in the English language and the English WordNet database and software tools have been released under a BSD style license and are freely available for download. The latest official release from Princeton was released in 2011. Princeton currently has no plans to release any new versions due to staffing and funding issues. New versions are still being released annually through the Open English WordNet website. Until about 2024 an online version was previously available through wordnet.princeton.edu. That version of WordNet has been deprecated, but a new online version is available at en-word.net. There are now WordNets in more than 200 languages.\nHistory and team members.\nWordNet was first created in 1985, in English only, in the Cognitive Science Laboratory of Princeton University under the direction of psychology professor George Armitage Miller. It was later directed by Christiane Fellbaum. The project was initially funded by the U.S. Office of Naval Research, and later also by other U.S. government agencies including the DARPA, the National Science Foundation, the Disruptive Technology Office (formerly the Advanced Research and Development Activity) and REFLEX. George Miller and Christiane Fellbaum received the 2006 Antonio Zampolli Prize for their work with WordNet.\nThe Global WordNet Association is a non-commercial organization that provides a platform for discussing, sharing and connecting WordNets for all languages in the world. Christiane Fellbaum and Piek Th.J.M. Vossen are its co-presidents.\nDatabase contents.\nThe database contains 155,327 words organized in 175,979 synsets for a total of 207,016 word-sense pairs; in compressed form, it is about 12 megabytes in size.\nIt includes the lexical categories nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs but ignores prepositions, determiners and other function words.\nWords from the same lexical category that are roughly synonymous are grouped into synsets, which include simplex words as well as collocations like \"eat out\" and \"car pool.\" The different senses of a polysemous word form are assigned to different synsets. A synset's meaning is further clarified with a short defining \"gloss\" and one or more usage examples. An example adjective synset is:\n good, right, ripe \u2013 (most suitable or right for a particular purpose; \"a good time to plant tomatoes\"; \"the right time to act\"; \"the time is ripe for great sociological changes\")\nAll synsets are connected by means of semantic relations. These relations, which are not all shared by all lexical categories, include:\nThese semantic relations hold among all members of the linked synsets. Individual synset members (words) can also be connected with lexical relations. For example, (one sense of) the noun \"director\" is linked to (one sense of) the verb \"direct\" from which it is derived via a \"morphosemantic\" link.\nThe morphology functions of the software distributed with the database try to deduce the lemma or stem form of a word from the user's input. Irregular forms are stored in a list, and looking up \"ate\" will return \"eat,\" for example.\nKnowledge structure.\nBoth nouns and verbs are organized into hierarchies, defined by hypernym or \"IS A\" relationships. For instance, one sense of the word \"dog\" is found following hypernym hierarchy; the words at the same level represent synset members. Each set of synonyms has a unique index.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Tree list/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAt the top level, these hierarchies are organized into 25 beginner \"trees\" for nouns and 15 for verbs (called \"lexicographic files\" at a maintenance level). All are linked to a unique beginner synset, \"entity\".\nNoun hierarchies are far deeper than verb hierarchies.\nAdjectives are not organized into hierarchical trees. Instead, two \"central\" antonyms such as \"hot\" and \"cold\" form binary poles, while 'satellite' synonyms such as \"steaming\" and \"chilly\" connect to their respective poles via a \"similarity\" relations. The adjectives can be visualized in this way as \"dumbbells\" rather than as \"trees\".\nPsycholinguistic aspects.\nThe initial goal of the WordNet project was to build a lexical database that would be consistent with theories of human semantic memory developed in the late 1960s. Psychological experiments indicated that speakers organized their knowledge of concepts in an economic, hierarchical fashion. Retrieval time required to access conceptual knowledge seemed to be directly related to the number of hierarchies the speaker needed to \"traverse\" to access the knowledge. Thus, speakers could more quickly verify that \"canaries can sing\" because a canary is a songbird, but required slightly more time to verify that \"canaries can fly\" (where they had to access the concept \"bird\" on the superordinate level) and even more time to verify \"canaries have skin\" (requiring look-up across multiple levels of hyponymy, up to \"animal\").\nWhile such psycholinguistic experiments and the underlying theories have been subject to criticism, some of WordNet's organization is consistent with experimental evidence. For example, anomic aphasia selectively affects speakers' ability to produce words from a specific semantic category, a WordNet hierarchy. Antonymous adjectives (WordNet's central adjectives in the dumbbell structure) are found to co-occur far more frequently than chance, a fact that has been found to hold for many languages.\nAs a lexical ontology.\nWordNet is sometimes called an ontology, a persistent claim that its creators do not make. The hypernym/hyponym relationships among the noun synsets can be interpreted as specialization relations among conceptual categories. In other words, WordNet can be interpreted and used as a lexical ontology in the computer science sense. However, such an ontology should be corrected before being used, because it contains hundreds of basic semantic inconsistencies; for example there are, (i) common specializations for exclusive categories and (ii) redundancies in the specialization hierarchy. Furthermore, transforming WordNet into a lexical ontology usable for knowledge representation should normally also involve (i)\u00a0distinguishing the specialization relations into \"subtypeOf\" and \"instanceOf\" relations, and (ii)\u00a0associating intuitive unique identifiers to each category. Although such corrections and transformations have been performed and documented as part of the integration of WordNet\u00a01.7 into the cooperatively updatable knowledge base of WebKB-2, most projects claiming to reuse WordNet for knowledge-based applications (typically, knowledge-oriented information retrieval) simply reuse it directly.\nWordNet has also been converted to a formal specification, by means of a hybrid bottom-up top-down methodology to automatically extract association relations from it and interpret these associations in terms of a set of conceptual relations, formally defined in the DOLCE foundational ontology.\nIn most works that claim to have integrated WordNet into ontologies, the content of WordNet has not simply been corrected when it seemed necessary; instead, it has been heavily reinterpreted and updated whenever suitable. This was the case when, for example, the top-level ontology of WordNet was restructured according to the OntoClean-based approach, or when it was used as a primary source for constructing the lower classes of the SENSUS ontology.\nLimitations.\nThe most widely discussed limitation of WordNet (and related resources like ImageNet) is that some of the semantic relations are more suited to concrete concepts than to abstract concepts. For example, it is easy to create hyponyms/hypernym relationships to capture that a \"conifer\" is a type of \"tree\", a \"tree\" is a type of \"plant\", and a \"plant\" is a type of \"organism\", but it is difficult to classify emotions like \"fear\" or \"happiness\" into equally deep and well-defined hyponyms/hypernym relationships.\nMany of the concepts in WordNet are specific to certain languages and the most accurate reported mapping between languages is 94%. Synonyms, hyponyms, meronyms, and antonyms occur in all languages with a WordNet so far, but other semantic relationships are language-specific. This limits the interoperability across languages. However, it also makes WordNet a resource for highlighting and studying the differences between languages, so it is not necessarily a limitation for all use cases.\nWordNet does not include information about the etymology or the pronunciation of words and it contains only limited information about usage. WordNet aims to cover most everyday words and does not include much domain-specific terminology.\nWordNet is the most commonly used computational lexicon of English for word-sense disambiguation (WSD), a task aimed at assigning the context-appropriate meanings (i.e. synset members) to words in a text. However, it has been argued that WordNet encodes sense distinctions that are too fine-grained. This issue prevents WSD systems from achieving a level of performance comparable to that of humans, who do not always agree when confronted with the task of selecting a sense from a dictionary that matches a word in a context. The granularity issue has been tackled by proposing clustering methods that automatically group together similar senses of the same word.\nOffensive content.\nWordNet includes words that can be perceived as pejorative or offensive. The interpretation of a word can change over time and between social groups, so it is not always possible for WordNet to define a word as \"pejorative\" or \"offensive\" in isolation. Therefore, people using WordNet must apply their own methods to identify offensive or pejorative words.\nHowever, this limitation is true of other lexical resources like dictionaries and thesauruses, which also contain pejorative and offensive words. Some dictionaries indicate words that are pejoratives, but do not include all the contexts in which words might be acceptable or offensive to different social groups. Therefore, people using dictionaries must apply their own methods to identify all offensive words.\nLicensed vs. Open WordNets.\nSome wordnets were subsequently created for other languages. A 2012 survey lists the wordnets and their availability. In an effort to propagate the usage of WordNets, the Global WordNet community had been slowly re-licensing their WordNets to an open domain where researchers and developers can easily access and use WordNets as language resources to provide ontological and lexical knowledge in natural-language processing (NLP) tasks.\nThe Open Multilingual WordNet provides access to open licensed wordnets in a variety of languages, all linked to the Princeton Wordnet of English (PWN). The goal is to make it easy to use wordnets in multiple languages.\nApplications.\nWordNet has been used for a number of purposes in information systems, including word-sense disambiguation, information retrieval, automatic text classification, automatic text summarization, machine translation and even automatic crossword puzzle generation.\nA common use of WordNet is to determine the similarity between words. Various algorithms have been proposed, including measuring the distance among words and synsets in WordNet's graph structure, such as by counting the number of edges among synsets. The intuition is that the closer two words or synsets are, the closer their meaning. A number of WordNet-based word similarity algorithms are implemented in a Perl package called WordNet::Similarity, and in a Python package called NLTK. Other more sophisticated WordNet-based similarity techniques include ADW, whose implementation is available in Java. WordNet can also be used to inter-link other vocabularies.\nInterfaces.\nPrinceton maintains a list of related projects that includes links to some of the widely used application programming interfaces available for accessing WordNet using various programming languages and environments.\nRelated projects and extensions.\nWordNet is connected to several databases of the Semantic Web. WordNet is also commonly reused via mappings between the WordNet synsets and the categories from ontologies. Most often, only the top-level categories of WordNet are mapped.\nGlobal WordNet Association.\nThe Global WordNet Association (GWA) is a public and non-commercial organization that provides a platform for discussing, sharing and connecting wordnets for all languages in the world. The GWA also promotes the standardization of wordnets across languages, to ensure its uniformity in enumerating the synsets in human languages. The GWA keeps a list of wordnets developed around the world.\nOther languages.\nProjects such as BalkaNet and EuroWordNet made it feasible to create standalone wordnets linked to the original one. Two such projects were the Russian WordNet, patronized by Petersburg State University of Means of Communication and led by S.A. Yablonsky, and Russnet, by Saint Petersburg State University.\nDistributions.\nWordNet Database is distributed as a dictionary package (usually a single file) for the following software:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "33956", "revid": "49389032", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33956", "title": "Whippet", "text": "British breed of dog\nThe Whippet is a British breed of dog of sighthound type. It closely resembles the Greyhound and the smaller Italian Greyhound, and is intermediate between them in size. In the nineteenth century it was sometimes called \"the poor man's racehorse\". It is commonly kept as a companion dog, for competitive showing or for amateur racing, and may participate in various dog sports, including lure coursing, agility, and flyball. It has the fastest running speed within its weight and size range, and is believed to have the fastest idle-to-running acceleration of any dog. \nWhippets are characterized by their gentle, affectionate, and calm temperament. While typically relaxed and serene at home, they exhibit high energy and excitement when outdoors. Originally bred as hunting and racing dogs, Whippets have a strong prey drive, which may lead them to chase small animals.\nWhippets have a minimal-shedding coat that is easy to manage due to its short, smooth texture and lack of an undercoat. However, their short coat and low body fat make them particularly sensitive to cold temperatures, so they may require extra protection, such as a dog jacket, in cooler weather. The breed is generally healthy, benefiting from a strong, athletic constitution, and is free from many hereditary issues seen in other breeds.\nThe concept of greyhound-type dogs of various sizes\u2014large, medium, and small\u2014has been well-documented in hunting manuals and natural history works dating back to the Middle Ages. In the early 15th century, Edward of Norwich, 2nd Duke of York, translated and expanded the late 14th-century French \"Livre de chasse\", a comprehensive manual on instructions for hunting with dogs. In his work, he highlighted the benefits of keeping \u2018great,\u2019 \u2018middle,\u2019 and \u2018small-sized Greyhounds\u2019 for hunting different kinds of game. Later, in the 16th century, English physician and academic John Caius referenced both greater and lesser types of \"Leporarius, Grehounde\" (Greyhound) in his book \"De Canibus Britannicis\". Notably, he described a type connected to the Whippet: the tumbler, a 'lesser sort of mungrell greyhounde' that was an excellent warren dog used for catching rabbits. The tumbler was also recorded by Thomas Brown, a Scottish curator and editor, in the early 19th century. \nName.\nThe name \"Whippet\" is derived from an early seventeenth-century term, now obsolete, meaning \"to move briskly.\" \nIn the Victorian era, English writers began describing an emerging modern breed of Whippet, also known as the \"snap-dog,\" a term derived from their tendency to readily 'snap up' nearby prey due to their naturally high prey drive. This breed was primarily developed for catching rabbits, coursing competitions, straight racing, and the growing trend of show fancy.\nHistory.\nWhippets, like all other sighthounds, were bred to hunt using their sight-driven prey instinct, coursing game in open areas at high speeds. Numerous representations of small, sighthound-like hunting dogs can be found in Ancient Egyptian artworks dating back thousands of years, possibly depicting ancient forms of the Greyhound, Basenji, Pharaoh Hound, or Saluki. In medieval England, a small greyhound-type breed became popular as a ratting dog. The first written use of the word 'whippet' in English, referring to a type of dog, was in 1610. In a painting by Jean-Baptiste Oudry (1686\u20131755) of two dogs named \u2018Misse\u2019 and \u2018Turlu\u2019, presented to Louis XV, the dogs depicted were either Whippets or another small, smooth-coated sighthound, but they were likely an early form of the Whippet. Oudry also completed a second painting of Misse with a different, non-sighthound breed of dog. A 1758 painting by Pompeo Batoni, \"Portrait of Charles Compton, 7th Earl of Northampton\", also features a similar, whippet-like dog.\nIn the 19th century, Whippet racing was a popular sport in parts of England. The breed was highly regarded in the northern parts of England, as well as in Wales, but was generally disregarded in the rest of the country. At the time, there were two varieties of Whippet: one type had a smoother coat and was more popular in Lancashire, Yorkshire, and the Midlands, later becoming the modern Whippet. The second form had a rougher coat due to crossbreeding with Bedlington Terriers. This type was more popular in Durham and Northumberland, and was frequently referred to as a 'rabbit dog'. Early specimens were taken from the racetrack by dog fanciers of the time and later exported around the world. John Taylor, an English writer, noted that \"In all the shapes and forms of dogges; of all which there are but two sorts that are useful to man's profits, which two are the mastiffe and the little curre, whippet, or house-dogge; all the rest are for pleasure and recreation.\"\nThe modern Whippet seemingly came into its own in 1891 when The Kennel Club officially recognized the breed. This recognition allowed Whippets to compete in dog shows and have their pedigrees recorded. In the United States, the Whippet was recognized three years earlier, in 1888, by the American Kennel Club (AKC). The breed arrived in the U.S. from England, brought by mill operators, with the first populations established in Massachusetts. According to the AKC ranking, the Whippet has consistently ranked within the top 60 breeds over the past decade, with a ranking of 50th place in 2024.\nIn 1964, the Whippet Ch. Courtenay Fleetfoot of Pennyworth won Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. Later, in 1992, Pencloe Dutch Gold won best in show at Crufts, followed by Cobyco Call the Tune in 2004 and Ch. Collooney Tartan Tease in 2018. In 2011, the female Whippet GCh. Starline's Chanel was named Hound Group Show Dog of the Year by the Westminster Kennel Club.\nDescription.\nAppearance.\nThe Whippet is a medium-sized dog with a sleek, aerodynamic body typical of sighthounds, adapted for speed and agility. It has a deep chest for efficient lung capacity, long, slender legs, and a narrow, muscular build characteristic of breeds developed for running. The ideal height for bitches is , and for dogs . The standards of the American Kennel Club and Canadian Kennel Club allow for larger animals, with an upper limit of for bitches and for dogs. Because colour is considered immaterial in judging Whippets, they come in a wide variety of colours and marking patterns, ranging from solid black to solid white, with red, fawn, brindle, blue, or cream. In 2019, The Kennel Club announced that it would no longer accept registrations for merle Whippets, as it is not a naturally occurring colour in the breed.\nThe coat is short, smooth, and close-fitting, contributing to the breed's streamlined appearance. Due to their short coat and low body fat, Whippets are not well-insulated against cold temperatures. While they are well-suited for indoor living due to their minimal grooming needs and low shedding, they may require additional protection, such as a coat or sweater, when exposed to cold weather.\nTemperament.\nWhippets are quiet and reserved, but they also exhibit a playful side and require regular exercise to maintain their physical and mental health. They are generally gentle dogs and are often content to spend much of the day relaxing. The American Kennel Club (AKC) describes them as \"quiet and dignified in their owner's living room\" and says they make \"excellent house dogs.\" Despite their calm nature indoors, they enjoy outdoor activities, especially short bursts of explosive running that allow them to reach high speeds. These brief, intense sprints are followed by long periods of rest, reflecting their energetic profile and need for recovery. They have been called a \"poor man's racehorse\" by the colliers in Lancashire and Yorkshire.\nThe Whippet will form a strong bond and devotion to its owner and, as such, can often suffer from separation anxiety, like many other breeds when left alone. Though not prone to excessive barking, Whippets will occasionally vocalize in the presence of intruders, making them passable watchdogs, similar to other small-to-medium dogs. However, a Whippet is unlikely to attack or guard against anyone due to their gentle and often shy demeanor, preferring to retreat rather than confront danger. While their gentle demeanor makes them a good choice for households with children or other pets, it is important to note that Whippets possess a highly developed prey drive. This instinct, though manageable with proper training and socialization, can make them prone to chasing small animals, such as cats, rabbits, or squirrels, especially in uncontrolled environments. Owners should take care during walks or when allowing them off-leash in unenclosed areas.\nSpeed and gait.\nWhippets are known as the fastest dogs of their weight class, capable of achieving speeds of up to , due to their ability to run in a double suspension gallop. This distinctive gait, in which all four legs are off the ground twice during each stride\u2014once when fully extended and again when tucked under the body\u2014allows for maximum speed and efficiency. Combined with their muscular build, this running style enhances their agility and athleticism, making them highly skilled competitors in racing and field trials.\nHealth.\nThe Whippet is a generally healthy breed, with a robust constitution. Having been bred for coursing, working, and racing for many years, it has maintained a structurally sound build. This long history of selective breeding has helped it avoid many of the physical exaggerations that often lead to health issues in other breeds. As a result, the Whippet is typically free from the common hereditary conditions found in more exaggerated dog types, making it a relatively low-maintenance breed in terms of health. \nThe Whippet, like other sighthounds, is intolerant of barbiturate anaesthetics. This is partly due to its low body fat concentration, which affects its ability to metabolize these anaesthetics. Additionally, the Whippet\u2019s liver is not well-equipped to process barbiturates, making it more susceptible to adverse reactions during anaesthesia.\nA 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 13.4 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 years for purebreeds and 12 years for crossbreeds. They are generally healthy, and are not prone to the frequent ear infections, skin allergies, or digestive problems that can afflict other breeds. Genetic eye defects, though quite rare, have been noted in the breed. Hip dysplasia is rare in Whippets, with only 1.2% of 161 evaluations performed by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals being determined as dysplastic.\nThe Whippet's heart is notably large and slow-beating, often exhibiting arrhythmic or even intermittent patterns when the dog is at rest. This trait can occasionally alarm owners or veterinarians unfamiliar with the breed. During exercise, however, the Whippet's heart demonstrates a regular and efficient rhythm, supporting its exceptional athletic abilities. A health survey conducted by The Kennel Club revealed that cardiac issues are the second leading cause of mortality in the breed, highlighting the importance of regular veterinary check-ups to monitor heart health. Heart failure is particularly common among Whippets in their senior years, with mitral valve disease (MVD) being one of the most prevalent heart conditions affecting the breed. MVD involves the weakening and deformation of the mitral valve, preventing it from closing tightly, which leads to mitral regurgitation (MR) and increased strain on the heart. While many Whippets exhibit heart murmurs, distinguishing functional murmurs from those associated with MR can be challenging, as functional murmurs often occur in healthy, athletic dogs. The study indicated that additional evaluation methods, such as echocardiography, are necessary to differentiate between functional murmurs and murmurs indicative of MVD in this population.\nA 2007 study identified a myostatin mutation specific to the Whippet that is strongly associated with its athletic performance. Whippets with a single copy of this mutation are generally unaffected, while those with two copies develop disproportionately large musculature and are referred to as \"Bully Whippets\". Despite their unusual appearance, bully Whippets experience no significant health issues beyond those typical of the breed, although they may be slightly more prone to muscle cramping. Interestingly, this mutation has not been observed in Greyhounds, other sighthound breeds, or heavily muscled dogs such as Bulldogs, Rottweilers, or American Staffordshire Terriers.\nRacing.\nDog racing was originally an extension of hare coursing. Whippets began to be bred to race in the mid-nineteenth century and became popular for racing. The first form of the sport was a rudimentary version of coursing known as 'ragging', and dogs who participated were said to be 'trained to the rag'. Dogs were kept on a leash by a person known as a \"slip\", who was often also the race judge. The slip would release the dogs from their collars at the same time, and they would race towards their owners, who were standing at the opposite end of the track waving towels to encourage the dogs to run toward them.\nWhippet rags were a popular Sunday event in the north and Midlands at the time. There were also international events; in Australia, at a track known as Gurney's Paddock, races with more than 300 Whippets were held every Saturday, and three nights a week at the White City track. Eventually, the sport evolved, and dogs were divided into four groups: those who hunted rabbits, which was not governed by rules; those who coursed hares, for which a set of rules was established; those trained to the rag; and those trained to chase a mechanical lure in a fashion similar to Greyhound races. Few of the Whippets in any of the four groups were purebred, as maintaining a purebred bloodline was not considered as important as breeding dogs that could win races. Many racing dogs were part-terrier, part-Greyhound, or part-Lurcher.\nIn 1967, the \"British Whippet Racing Association\" was established to introduce reforms and standardize race rules and procedures for races involving non-purebred Whippets. A year later, viewing the non-purebred dogs as a threat, the \"Whippet Club Racing Association\" was established to regulate racing exclusively for purebred Whippets.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

With a total height of , it is the second tallest building in both Warsaw and Poland (after the Varso Tower), the eighth tallest building in the European Union and one of the tallest on the European continent. At the time of its completion in 1955, the Palace was the eighth tallest building in the world, retaining the position until 1961; it was also briefly the tallest clock tower in the world, from 2000 until the 2002 installation of a clock mechanism on the NTT Docomo Yoyogi Building in Tokyo, Japan.\nInspired by Polish historical architecture and American art deco high-rise buildings, the Palace of Culture and Science was designed by Soviet-Russian architect Lev Rudnev in \"Seven Sisters\" style.\nThe Palace houses various public and cultural institutions, including theatres, museums, universities, a cinema, a concert hall, a public swimming pool, and the offices of the Polish Academy of Sciences. The building is decorated with sculptures representing the fields of culture and science. The main entrance features sculptures of the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus, by Ludwika Nitschowa, and the poet Adam Mickiewicz, by Stanis\u0142aw Horno-Pop\u0142awski. Since 2007, the PKiN has been listed in the Registry of Objects of Cultural Heritage.\nName.\nThe building was originally known as the Joseph Stalin Palace of Culture and Science (\"Pa\u0142ac Kultury i Nauki imienia J\u00f3zefa Stalina\"). During the period of destalinization, the dedication to Stalin was revoked. Stalin's name was removed from the colonnade, the interior lobby and one of the building's sculptures.\nThe Palace has a variety of nicknames. The most popular ones are \"Pekin\" (\"Beijing\", from its acronym \"PKiN\") and \"Patyk\" (\"stick\", presumably from its appearance). Other nicknames include \"pajac\" (\"clown\", a word that sounds similar to \"pa\u0142ac\"), \"strzykawka\" (\"syringe\"), \"s\u0142o\u0144 w koronkowych gatkach\" (\"elephant in lacy underwear\"), \"ruski tort\" (\"Russian birthday cake\"), \"rakieta Stalina\" (\"Stalin' rocket\"), \"koszmarny sen pijanego cukiernika\" (\"drunk confectioner's nightmare\", attributed to poet W\u0142adys\u0142aw Broniewski), and vulgar terms such as \"chuj Stalina\" (\"Stalin's dick\").\nHistory.\nConstruction.\nThe agreement to construct the tower was signed between the governments of the Polish People's Republic and the Soviet Union on 5 April 1952. It was offered as a gift to the people of Poland. Upon its completion in 1955, it was dedicated to Joseph Stalin.\nTo visually determine the optimal height of the building, Soviet and Polish architects gathered near the eastern approach of the Silesian-D\u0105browa Bridge. A small airplane flew over the planned site of the Palace, towing a balloon. It made the first pass at , then at . The Soviets, led by Lev Rudnev, decided that was enough for the tallest building in the city. However, the Poles, led by the chief architect of Warsaw, J\u00f3zef Sigalin, kept shouting \"Higher!\" after every pass. Finally, the tower's height was set at , with a main structure, a turret and a spire.\nConstruction started in May 1952 and lasted until July 1955. The tower was built using Soviet plans. It is estimated that between 3,500 and 5,000 Soviet guest workers and 4,000 local Polish workers participated in the project. 16 workers died in accidents during construction. The builders were housed at a new residential complex built at Poland's expense in the Bemowo district of Warsaw, called Osiedle Przyja\u017a\u0144 (\"Friendship Neighborhood\"). The complex had its own cinema, a food court, a community center and a swimming pool.\nThe architecture of the building has many similarities to Moscow's Seven Sisters, a group of Stalinist skyscrapers by the same architect, in particular the main building of Moscow State University. Other similar buildings are the House of the Free Press in Bucharest and the Latvian Academy of Sciences Building in Riga. However, Lev Rudnev incorporated Polish architectural details into the project after travelling around the country. For example, the parapets are modeled on Renaissance houses and the palaces of Krak\u00f3w and Zamo\u015b\u0107.\nEarly years.\nAt the time of its completion, the Palace of Culture and Science was the eighth tallest building in the world and the second tallest building in Europe (after the Moscow State University Building). The Palace retained these positions until 1961 and 1990, respectively.\nShortly after opening, many visiting dignitaries toured the Palace, and the building hosted the 5th World Festival of Youth and Students, held from July to August 1955. In 1956, several people committed suicide by jumping from the observation deck on the 30th floor, at the height of . The first victim was a Frenchman, followed by seven Poles. After these incidents, the observation deck was enclosed in steel bars.\nThe Palace's concert hall has hosted performances by notable international artists. In 1967, The Rolling Stones became the first major western rock group to hold a concert behind the Iron Curtain. The 1985 concert by Leonard Cohen, held during the period of martial law in Poland, was surrounded by intense expectations that the artist would make a political statement about the growing Solidarity movement.\nPresent day.\nThe building currently serves as an exhibition centre and office complex. The Palace contains a multiplex cinema with eight screens (Kinoteka), four theatres (Studio, Dramatyczny, Lalka and 6. pi\u0119tro), two museums (Museum of Evolution and Museum of Technology), offices, bookshops, a large swimming pool, an auditorium hall for 3,000 people called Congress Hall, and an accredited universities: Collegium Civitas, on the 11th and 12th floors of the building and WSB University, Warsaw, on the 8th floor. The terrace on the 30th floor, at , is a well-known tourist attraction with a panoramic view of the city. The Warsaw City Council and city offices are located in the building.\nA collection of sculptures representing figures of the fields of culture and science surrounds the Palace. Two of them are located in front of the main entrance: one of Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus, by Ludwika Nitschowa, and another of Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz, by Stanis\u0142aw Horno-Pop\u0142awski.\nFour clock faces were added to the top of the building ahead of the millennium celebrations in 2000. The clocks began working on 31 December 2000.\nThe Congress Hall held the finals of Miss World 2006.\nIn 2010, the illumination of the building was modernized and high-power LED lights were installed, allowing the Palace to take various colours at night. The first use of the new lighting was during Christmas in 2010, when the Palace was illuminated in green and white to resemble a Christmas tree. In December 2013, during the Euromaidan protests, it was illuminated in blue and yellow, the colours of the Ukrainian national flag as a sign of solidarity with the protesters. On 29 January 2021, during the Women's Strike protests, the symbol of the movement\u2014a single red bolt on a black background\u2014was projected on the building.\nRadio and TV transmitter.\nDue to its height, the Palace has always been an attractive location for telecommunication antennas. The first antenna was installed in 1956 to transmit state television signals. In 1974, a microwave link was installed to send Polskie Radio Program I programming to the longwave Warsaw radio mast in Konstantyn\u00f3w. FM radio transmissions began in 1992.\nDigital television transmissions began on 22 July 2008, using the DVB-T standard. Nowadays, all six digital multiplexes of the country's free-to-air broadcasters are transmitted from the Palace. Analog television transmissions were shut down on 19 March 2013.\nSoviet Central Television Programme One, later Channel One Russia, was rebroadcast from the PKiN transmitter between 1 April 1987 and 31 May 1997. Its target audience was the Soviet Armed Forces (later Russian Armed Forces) personnel stationed in the country until 1993.\nFauna.\nThe 42nd floor of the Palace is a nesting place for peregrine falcons. In 2009, cameras were installed at the site, with a live view from the nest being available on the website of the Association for Wild Animals Sok\u00f3\u0142. In 2016, after a five-year break, a pair of falcons had offspring there. In a competition of internet users, the young falcons were given the names Bazyl, Orion and Wawa. In 2017, due to the maintenance works on the spire of the building, the falcons were moved to the highest floor of the Warsaw Trade Tower skyscraper. They returned to the Palace of Culture and Science after the renovation of the spire was completed.\nCats live on the second basement floor, with the administration of the Palace of Culture and Science responsible for their care. In the past, there were several dozen of them, while in June 2015 the number of these animals was 11.\nSince 2015, an apiary is kept on the roof of the Studio Theatre at the Palace of Culture and Science.\nControversy.\nThe Palace of Culture and Science is highly controversial. It was built at the peak of Stalinism, when Polish citizens suffered severe violations of their human rights. As a result, it is often viewed as a symbol of Soviet domination over the Polish People's Republic.\n\"Porozumienie Organizacji Kombatanckich i Niepodleg\u0142o\u015bciowych w Krakowie\", a coalition of veteran and nationalist groups, and the Law and Justice party have called for its demolition. In 2009, then Foreign Minister Rados\u0142aw Sikorski supported the demolition of the Palace noting the expense involved in its maintenance. Other prominent government leaders have continued to endorse demolition plans, including former Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "33958", "revid": "910180", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33958", "title": "Wake-on-LAN", "text": "Mechanism to wake up computers via a network\nWake-on-LAN (WoL) is an Ethernet or Token Ring computer networking standard that allows a computer to be turned on or awakened from sleep mode by a network message.\nThe message is usually sent to the target computer by a program executed on a device connected to the same local area network (LAN). It is also possible to initiate the message from another network by using subnet directed broadcasts or a WoL gateway service. It is based upon AMD's \"Magic Packet Technology\", which was co-developed by AMD and Hewlett-Packard, following its proposal as a standard in 1995. The standard saw quick adoption thereafter through IBM, Intel and others.\nIf the computer being awakened is communicating via Wi-Fi, a supplementary standard called Wake on Wireless LAN (WoWLAN) must be employed.\nThe WoL and WoWLAN standards are often supplemented by vendors to provide protocol-transparent on-demand services, for example in the Apple Bonjour wake-on-demand (Sleep Proxy) feature.\nHistory.\nThe basis for the \"Wake-on-LAN\" industry standard mechanism today was created around 1994 by AMD in cooperation with Hewlett-Packard, who co-developed AMD's \"Magic Packet Technology\" and brought forth their following proposal for it in November 1995 in an AMD white paper. It enabled a remote network device to be woken up through the underlying \u201cpower management circuitry\u201d, by sending it a standard Ethernet frame, which \u201ccontains a specific data pattern detected by the Ethernet-controller on the receiving end\u201d.\nAMD implemented the WoL mechanism in their \"AMD PCnet II\"-Family of Ethernet controllers before. The term \"\u201cMagic Packet\u201d\" is a AMD trademark.\nWake-on-LAN saw wide adoption starting in October 1996, when IBM formed the \"Advanced Manageability Alliance\" (AMA) with Intel. In April 1997, this alliance adopted the Wake-on-LAN technology.\nContrary to most networking protocols, no formal Request for Comments (RFC) documents have been created for Wake-on-LAN, but nevertheless it remains a standard that is widely used in the industry.\nPrinciple of operation.\nEthernet connections, including home and work networks, wireless data networks, and the Internet itself, are based on frames sent between computers. WoL is implemented using a specially designed frame called a magic packet, which is commonly sent to all computers in a network, among them the computer to be awakened. The magic packet contains the MAC address of the destination computer. This is an identifying number, built into each network interface controller (NIC), that enables the NIC to be uniquely recognized and addressed on a network. In computers capable of Wake-on-LAN, the NIC(s) \"listen\" to incoming packets, even when the rest of the system is powered down. If a magic packet arrives and is addressed to the device's MAC address, the NIC signals the computer's power supply or motherboard to awaken. This has the same effect as pressing the power button.\nThe magic packet is broadcast on the data link layer to all attached devices on a given network, using the network broadcast address; the IP address (which relates to the internet layer) is not used. Because Wake-on-LAN is built upon broadcast messaging, it can generally only be used within a subnet. Wake-on-LAN can, however, operate across any network in practice, given appropriate configuration and hardware, including remote wake-up across the Internet.\nIn order for Wake-on-LAN to work, parts of the network interface need to stay on. This consumes a small amount of standby power. To further reduce power consumption, the link speed is usually reduced to the lowest possible speed (e.g. a Gigabit Ethernet NIC maintains only a 10\u00a0Mbit/s link). Disabling Wake-on-LAN, when not needed, can slightly reduce power consumption on computers that are switched off but still plugged into a power socket. The power drain becomes a consideration on battery-powered devices such as laptops as this can deplete the battery even when the device is completely shut down.\nMagic packet.\nThe \"magic packet\" is a frame that is most often sent as a broadcast and that contains anywhere within its payload 6 bytes of all 255 (FF FF FF FF FF FF in hexadecimal), followed by sixteen repetitions of the target computer's 48-bit MAC address, for a total of 102 bytes.\nSince the magic packet is only scanned for the string above, and not actually parsed by a full protocol stack, it could be sent as payload of any network- and transport-layer protocol, although it is typically sent as a UDP datagram to port 0 (reserved port number), 7 (Echo Protocol) or 9 (Discard Protocol), or directly over Ethernet using EtherType 0x0842. A connection-oriented transport-layer protocol like TCP is less suited for this task as it requires establishing an active connection before sending user data.\nA standard magic packet has the following basic limitations:\nThe Wake-on-LAN implementation is designed to be simple and to be quickly processed by the circuitry present on the network interface controller using minimal power. Because Wake-on-LAN operates below the IP protocol layer, IP addresses and DNS names are meaningless and so the MAC address is required.\nSubnet directed broadcasts.\nA principal limitation of standard broadcast Wake-on-LAN is that broadcast packets are generally not routed. This prevents the technique being used in larger networks or over the Internet. Subnet-directed broadcasts (SDBs) may be used to overcome this limitation. SDB may require changes to the intermediate router configuration. SDBs are treated like unicast network packets until processed by the final (local) router. This router then broadcasts the packet using a layer-2 broadcast. This technique allows a broadcast to be initiated on a remote network but requires all intervening routers to forward the SDB. When preparing a network to forward SDB packets, care must be taken to filter packets so that only desired (e.g. WoL) SDB packets are permitted\u00a0\u2013 otherwise the network may become a participant in DDoS attacks such as the Smurf attack.\nTroubleshooting magic packets.\nWake-on-LAN can be a difficult technology to implement because it requires appropriate BIOS/UEFI, network interface hardware and, sometimes, operating system and router support to function reliably. In some cases, hardware may wake from one low-power state but not from others. This means that due to hardware issues the computer may be wakeable from its soft off state (S5) but doesn't wake from sleep or hibernation or vice versa.\nSecurity considerations.\nUnauthorized access.\nMagic packets are sent via the data link or OSI-2 layer, which can be used or abused by anyone on the same LAN, unless the L2 LAN equipment is capable of and configured for filtering such traffic to match site-wide security requirements.\nFirewalls may be used to prevent clients among the public WAN from accessing the broadcast addresses of inside LAN segments, or routers may be configured to ignore subnet-directed broadcasts.\nCertain NICs support a security feature called \"SecureOn\". It allows users to store within the NIC a hexadecimal password of 6 bytes. Clients append this password to the magic packet. The NIC wakes the system only if the MAC address and password are correct. This security measure significantly decreases the risk of successful brute force attacks, by increasing the search space by 48 bits (6 bytes), up to 296 combinations if the MAC address is entirely unknown. However, any network eavesdropping will expose the cleartext password.\nAbuse of the Wake-on-LAN feature only allows computers to be switched on; it does not in itself bypass password and other forms of security, and is unable to power off the machine once on. However, many client computers attempt booting from a PXE server when powered up by WoL. Therefore, a combination of DHCP and PXE servers on the network can sometimes be used to start a computer with an attacker's boot image, bypassing any security of the installed operating system and granting access to unprotected, local disks over the network.\nInteractions with network access control.\nThe use of Wake-on-LAN technology on enterprise networks can sometimes conflict with network access control solutions such as 802.1X MAC-based authentication, which may prevent magic packet delivery if a machine's WoL hardware has not been designed to maintain a live authentication session while in a sleep state.\nSecurity.\nSome PCs include technology built into the chipset to improve security for Wake-on-LAN. For example, Intel AMT (a component of Intel vPro technology). AMT uses TLS encryption to secure an out-of-band communication tunnel to an AMT-based PC for remote management commands such as Wake-on-LAN.\nAMT secures the communication tunnel with Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 128-bit encryption and RSA keys with modulus lengths of 2,048 bits. Because the encrypted communication is out-of-band, the PC's hardware and firmware receive the magic packet before network traffic reaches the software stack for the operating system (OS). Since the encrypted communication occurs \"below\" the OS level, it is less vulnerable to attacks by viruses, worms, and other threats that typically target the OS level.\nIT shops using Wake-on-LAN through the Intel AMT implementation can wake an AMT PC over network environments that require TLS-based security, such as IEEE 802.1X, Cisco Self Defending Network (SDN), and Microsoft Network Access Protection (NAP) environments. The Intel implementation also works for wireless networks.\nHardware requirements.\nWake-on-LAN support is implemented on the motherboard of a computer and in the network interface controller. It is consequently not dependent on the operating system running on the computer. In order to get Wake-on-LAN to work, enabling this feature on the network interface card or on-board silicon is sometimes required. Details of how to do this depend upon the operating system and the device driver.\nWake-on-LAN usually needs to be enabled in the Power Management section of a PC motherboard's BIOS/UEFI setup utility, although on some systems, such as Apple computers, it is enabled by default. On older systems the BIOS/UEFI setting may be referred to as WoL; on newer systems supporting PCI version 2.2, it may be referred to as PME (Power Management Events, which include WoL). It may also be necessary to configure the computer to reserve standby power for the network card when the system is shut down.\nWith older motherboards, if the network interface is a plug-in card rather than being integrated into the motherboard there may be a header onboard connected to the network card via a special three-pin cable the card. Systems supporting the PCI 2.2 standard and with a PCI 2.2 compliant network adapter card do not usually require a cable as the required standby power is relayed through the PCI bus. The power supply must meet ATX 2.01 specifications.\nLaptops powered by the Intel Centrino processor technology or newer (with explicit BIOS/UEFI support) allow waking up the machine using Wake on Wireless LAN (WoWLAN).\nIn most modern PCs, ACPI is notified of the \"waking up\" and takes control of the power-up. In ACPI, OSPM must record the \"wake source\" or the device that is causing the power-up\u00a0\u2013 the device being the \"soft\" power switch, the NIC (via Wake-on-LAN), the cover being opened, a temperature change, etc.\nThe three-pin WoL interface on the motherboard consists of: pin 1, +5V DC (red); pin 2, ground (black); pin 3, wake signal (green or yellow). By supplying the pin-3 wake signal with +5V DC the computer will be triggered to power up provided WoL is enabled in the BIOS/UEFI configuration.\nSoftware requirements.\nSoftware that sends a WoL magic packet is referred to in different circles as \"client\" or \"server\", which can be a source of confusion. While WoL hardware or firmware is arguably performing the role of a \"server\", Web-based interfaces that act as a gateway through which users can issue WoL packets without downloading a local client often become known as \"the Wake-on-LAN server\" to users. Additionally, software that administers WoL capabilities from the host OS side may be carelessly referred to as a \"client\" on occasion; sleeping machines capable of being awakened with WoL generally tend to be end-user desktops and, as such, are generally \"client machines\" in IT parlance but WoL is for the \"services\" they are running as, by definition, \"servers\".\nCreating and sending the magic packet.\nSoftware to send WoL magic packets is available for all modern platforms, including Windows, Macintosh and Linux, plus many smartphones. Examples include: Wake on LAN GUI, LAN Helper, Magic Packet Utility, NetWaker for Windows, Nirsoft WakeMeOnLAN, WakeOnLANx, EMCO WOL, Aquila Tech Wake on LAN, ManageEngine WOL utility, FusionFenix and SolarWinds WOL Tool.\nEnsuring the magic packet travels from source to destination.\nIf the sender is on the same subnet or local area network as the computer to be awakened there are generally no issues. When sending over the Internet, and in particular where a network address translation (NAT) router is involved (as typically in most homes), special settings are often necessary.\nFurther, the WoL protocol operates on a deeper level in the multi-layer networking architecture. To ensure the magic packet gets from source to destination while the destination is sleeping, the ARP binding must typically be set in a NAT router. This allows the router to forward the magic packet to the sleeping computer at the link layer, below Internet Protocol. There are some security implications of ARP binding (see ARP spoofing); however, an attacker must use a computer that is connected directly to the target LAN (plugged into the LAN via cable or connecting to a Wi\u2011Fi link) to gain access to the LAN.\nMost home routers are able to send magic packets to a LAN; for example, routers with the DD-WRT, Tomato or PfSense firmware have a built-in Wake-on-LAN client.\nResponding to the magic packet.\nMost WoL hardware functionally is typically blocked by default and needs to be enabled using the system BIOS/UEFI setup. Further configuration from the OS is required in some cases, for example via the Device Manager network card properties on Windows operating systems.\nMicrosoft Windows.\nNewer versions of Microsoft Windows integrate WoL functionality into the Device Manager. This is available in the power management tab of each network device's driver properties. For full support of a device's WoL capabilities (such as the ability to wake from an ACPI S5 power-off state), installation of the full driver suite from the network device manufacturer may be necessary, rather than the bare driver provided by Microsoft or the computer manufacturer. In most cases correct BIOS/UEFI configuration is also required for WoL to function.\nThe ability to wake from hybrid sleep is not officially supported in Windows. This is because of a change in the OS behavior which causes network adapters to be explicitly not armed for WoL when shutdown to these states occurs, so that those adapters don't consume power in what appears to the user to be a shutdown state, even though the system is just hibernating. WoL from a non-hybrid hibernation state when a user explicitly requests hibernation or a sleep state is supported. However, some hardware will enable WoL from states that are unsupported by Windows.\nMac hardware and macOS.\nModern Mac hardware supports WoL functionality when the computer is in a sleep state, but it is not possible to wake up a Mac computer from a powered-off state.\nMac OS X Snow Leopard and later support WoL, which is called Wake on Demand. On laptops, the feature is controlled via the macOS System Settings Battery panel, in the Options pop-up window. The \"Wake for network access\" item can be set to \"Always\", \"Only on Power Adapter\", or \"Never\"; \"Always\" enables Wake-on-LAN even when on battery power, but \"Only on Power Adapter\" enables it only when connected to a power supply. On desktops, the feature is controlled via the System Settings Energy Saver panel. Marking the \"Wake for network access\" checkbox enables Wake-on-LAN. It can also be configured through the terminal using the \"pmset womp\" (wake on magic packet) command.\nThe Apple Remote Desktop client management system can be used to send Wake-on-LAN packets, but there are also freeware and shareware macOS applications available. A mechanism called Bonjour Sleep Proxy, provided by Apple AirPort access points and Apple TVs, allows other machines on a LAN to cause a WoL packet to be sent to a host when that machine accesses one of the host's shared resources.\nLinux.\nWake-on-LAN support may be changed using a subfunction of the ethtool command, for example:\nethtool -s eth0 wol g\nOther machine states and LAN wakeup signals.\nA modern computer can be in various power states, with names such as \"sleep\", \"standby\", and \"hibernate\". In some reduced-power modes, the system state is stored in RAM and the machine can wake up very quickly; in others the state is saved to disk and the motherboard powered down, taking at least several seconds to wake up. The machine can be awakened from a reduced-power state by various signals.\nThe machine's BIOS/UEFI must be set to allow Wake-on-LAN. To allow wakeup from powered-down state, wakeup on power management event (PME) is also required.

Traditionally, \"witchcraft\" means the use of magic to inflict supernatural harm or misfortune on others, and this remains the most common and widespread meaning. Though the idea of witchcraft is largely imaginary, it has nevertheless served in many cultures as a way to explain the presence of evil. The belief in witches has been found throughout history in a great number of societies worldwide. Most of these societies have used protective magic or counter-magic against witchcraft, and have shunned, banished, imprisoned, physically punished or killed alleged witches. Anthropologists use the term \"witchcraft\" for similar beliefs about harmful occult practices in different cultures, and these societies often use the term when speaking in English.\nBelief in witchcraft as malevolent magic is attested from ancient Mesopotamia, and in Europe, belief in witches traces back to classical antiquity. In medieval and early modern Europe, accused witches were usually women who were believed to have secretly used black magic (\"maleficium\") against their own community. Usually, accusations of witchcraft were made by neighbors of accused witches, and followed from social tensions. Witches were sometimes said to have communed with demons or with the Devil, though such accusations were mainly made against perceived opponents of the Church. It was thought witchcraft could be thwarted by white magic, provided by 'cunning folk' or 'wise people'. Suspected witches were often prosecuted and punished, if found guilty or simply believed to be guilty. European witch-hunts and witch trials in the early modern period led to tens of thousands of executions. While magical healers and midwives were sometimes accused of witchcraft, they made up a minority of those accused. European belief in witchcraft gradually dwindled during and after the Age of Enlightenment.\nMany indigenous belief systems that include the concept of witchcraft likewise define witches as malevolent, and seek healers (such as medicine people and witch doctors) to ward off and undo bewitchment. Some African and Melanesian peoples believe witches are driven by an evil spirit or substance inside them. Modern witch-hunting takes place in parts of Africa and Asia.\nSince the 1930s, followers of certain kinds of modern paganism identify as witches and redefine the term \"witchcraft\" as part of their neopagan beliefs and practices. Other neo-pagans avoid the term due to its negative connotations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nConcept.\nThe most common meaning of \"witchcraft\" worldwide is the use of harmful magic. Belief in malevolent magic and the concept of witchcraft has lasted throughout recorded history and has been found in cultures worldwide, regardless of development. Most societies have feared an ability by some individuals to cause supernatural harm and misfortune to others. This may come from mankind's tendency \"to want to assign occurrences of remarkable good or bad luck to agency, either human or superhuman\". Historians and anthropologists see the concept of \"witchcraft\" as one of the ways humans have tried to explain strange misfortune. Some cultures have feared witchcraft much less than others because they tend to have other explanations for strange misfortune. For example, the Gaels of Ireland and the Scottish Highlands historically held a strong belief in fairy folk, who could cause supernatural harm, and witch-hunting was very rare in these regions compared to other regions of the British Isles.\nHistorian Ronald Hutton outlined five key characteristics ascribed to witches and witchcraft by most cultures that believe in this concept: the use of magic to cause harm or misfortune to others; it was used by the witch against their own community; powers of witchcraft were believed to have been acquired through inheritance or initiation; it was seen as immoral and often thought to involve communion with evil beings; and witchcraft could be thwarted by defensive magic, persuasion, intimidation or physical punishment of the alleged witch.\nA common belief worldwide is that witches use objects, words, and gestures to cause supernatural harm, or that they simply have an innate power to do so. Hutton notes that both kinds of practitioners are often believed to exist in the same culture and that the two often overlap, in that someone with an inborn power could wield that power through material objects. \nOne of the most influential works on witchcraft and concepts of magic was E. E. Evans-Pritchard's \"Witchcraft, Oracles and Magic Among the Azande\", a study of Azande witchcraft beliefs published in 1937. This provided definitions for witchcraft which became a convention in anthropology. However, some researchers argue that the general adoption of Evans-Pritchard's definitions constrained discussion of witchcraft beliefs, and even broader discussion of magic and religion, in ways that his work does not support. Evans-Pritchard reserved the term \"witchcraft\" for the actions of those who inflict harm by their inborn power and used \"sorcery\" for those who needed tools to do so. Historians found these definitions difficult to apply to European witchcraft, where witches were believed to use physical techniques, as well as some who were believed to cause harm by thought alone. The distinction \"has now largely been abandoned, although some anthropologists still sometimes find it relevant to the particular societies with which they are concerned\".\nWhile most cultures believe witchcraft to be something willful, some Indigenous peoples in Africa and Melanesia believe witches have a substance or an evil spirit in their bodies that drives them to do harm. Such substances may be believed to act on their own while the witch is sleeping or unaware. The Dobu people believe women work harmful magic in their sleep while men work it while awake. Further, in cultures where substances within the body are believed to grant supernatural powers, the substance may be good, bad, or morally neutral. Hutton draws a distinction between those who unwittingly cast the evil eye and those who deliberately do so, describing only the latter as witches.\nThe universal or cross-cultural validity of the terms \"witch\" and \"witchcraft\" are debated. Hutton states: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAccording to the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions there is \"difficulty of defining 'witches' and 'witchcraft' across cultures\u2014terms that, quite apart from their connotations in popular culture, may include an array of traditional or faith healing practices\".\nAnthropologist Fiona Bowie notes that the terms \"witchcraft\" and \"witch\" are used differently by scholars and the general public in at least four ways. Neopagan writer Isaac Bonewits proposed dividing witches into even more distinct types including, but not limited to: Neopagan, Feminist, Neogothic, Neoclassical, Classical, Family Traditions, Immigrant Traditions, and Ethnic.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"witchcraft\" is over a thousand years old: Old English formed the compound from ('witch') and ('craft'). The masculine form was ('male sorcerer').\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary, \"wicce\" and \"wicca\" were probably derived from the Old English verb , meaning 'to practice witchcraft'. \"Wiccian\" has a cognate in Middle Low German (attested from the 13th century). The further etymology of this word is problematic. It has no clear cognates in other Germanic languages outside of English and Low German, and there are numerous possibilities for the Indo-European root from which it may have derived.\nAnother Old English word for 'witch' was or , which became the modern English word \"hag\" and is linked to the word \"hex\". In most other Germanic languages, their word for 'witch' comes from the same root as these; for example German and Dutch .\nIn colloquial modern English, the word \"witch\" is particularly used for women. A male practitioner of magic or witchcraft is more commonly called a 'wizard', or sometimes, 'warlock'. When the word \"witch\" is used to refer to a member of a neo-pagan tradition or religion (such as Wicca), it can refer to a person of any gender.\nBeliefs about practices.\nWitches are commonly believed to cast curses; a spell or set of magical words and gestures intended to inflict supernatural harm. Cursing could also involve inscribing runes or sigils on an object to give that object magical powers; burning or binding a wax or clay image (a poppet) of a person to affect them magically; or using herbs, animal parts and other substances to make potions or poisons. Witchcraft has been blamed for many kinds of misfortune. In Europe, by far the most common kind of harm attributed to witchcraft was illness or death suffered by adults, their children, or their animals. \"Certain ailments, like impotence in men, infertility in women, and lack of milk in cows, were particularly associated with witchcraft\". Illnesses that were poorly understood were more likely to be blamed on witchcraft. Edward Bever writes: \"Witchcraft was particularly likely to be suspected when a disease came on unusually swiftly, lingered unusually long, could not be diagnosed clearly, or presented some other unusual symptoms\".\nA common belief in cultures worldwide is that witches tend to use something from their target's body to work magic against them; for example hair, nail clippings, clothing, or bodily waste. Such beliefs are found in Europe, Africa, South Asia, Polynesia, Melanesia, and North America. Another widespread belief among Indigenous peoples in Africa and North America is that witches cause harm by introducing cursed magical objects into their victim's body; such as small bones or ashes. James George Frazer described this kind of magic as imitative. \nIn some cultures, witches are believed to use human body parts in magic, and they are commonly believed to murder children for this purpose. In Europe, \"cases in which women did undoubtedly kill their children, because of what today would be called postpartum psychosis, were often interpreted as yielding to diabolical temptation\".\nWitches are believed to work in secret, sometimes alone and sometimes with other witches. Hutton writes: \"Across most of the world, witches have been thought to gather at night, when normal humans are inactive, and also at their most vulnerable in sleep\". In most cultures, witches at these gatherings are thought to transgress social norms by engaging in cannibalism, incest and open nudity. \nWitches around the world commonly have associations with animals. Rodney Needham identified this as a defining feature of the witch archetype. In some parts of the world, it is believed witches can shapeshift into animals, or that the witch's spirit travels apart from their body and takes an animal form, an activity often associated with shamanism. Another widespread belief is that witches have an animal helper. In English these are often called \"familiars\", and meant an evil spirit or demon that had taken an animal form. As researchers examined traditions in other regions, they widened the term to servant spirit-animals which are described as a part of the witch's own soul. \nNecromancy is the practice of conjuring the spirits of the dead for divination or prophecy, although the term has also been applied to raising the dead for other purposes. The biblical Witch of Endor performed it (1 Samuel 28th chapter), and it is among the witchcraft practices condemned by \u00c6lfric of Eynsham: \"Witches still go to cross-roads and to heathen burials with their delusive magic and call to the devil; and he comes to them in the likeness of the man that is buried there, as if he arises from death.\"\nJ.D. Krige argues that belief in witchcraft also serves various functions. One such function, he notes, is psychological: it enables people to account for failures not as a result of any fault of their own but due to the doings of others or other external malevolent forces. In this way, people can \"compensate for their inadequacy and continue to feel that they are masters of their own fate\". \nWitchcraft and folk healers.\nMost societies that have believed in harmful or black magic have also believed in helpful or white magic. Where belief in harmful magic is common, it is typically forbidden by law as well as hated and feared by the general populace, while helpful or apotropaic (protective) magic is tolerated or accepted by the population, even if the orthodox establishment opposes it.\nIn these societies, practitioners of helpful magic provide (or provided) services such as breaking the effects of witchcraft, healing, divination, finding lost or stolen goods, and love magic. In Britain, and some other parts of Europe, they were commonly known as 'cunning folk' or 'wise people'. Alan Macfarlane wrote that while cunning folk is the usual name, some are also known as 'blessers' or 'wizards', but might also be known as 'white', 'good', or 'unbinding witches'. Historian Owen Davies says the term \"white witch\" was rarely used before the 20th century. Ronald Hutton uses the general term \"service magicians\". Often these people were involved in identifying alleged witches.\nSuch helpful magic-workers \"were normally contrasted with the witch who practiced \"maleficium\"\u2014that is, magic used for harmful ends\". In the early years of the European witch hunts \"the cunning folk were widely tolerated by church, state and general populace\". Some of the more hostile churchmen and secular authorities tried to smear folk-healers and magic-workers by falsely branding them 'witches' and associating them with harmful 'witchcraft', but generally the masses did not accept this and continued to make use of their services. The English MP and skeptic Reginald Scot sought to disprove magic and witchcraft altogether, writing in \"The Discoverie of Witchcraft\" (1584), \"At this day, it is indifferent to say in the English tongue, 'she is a witch' or 'she is a wise woman'\". Historian Keith Thomas adds \"Nevertheless, it is possible to isolate that kind of 'witchcraft' which involved the employment (or presumed employment) of some occult means of doing harm to other people in a way which was generally disapproved of. In this sense the belief in witchcraft can be defined as the attribution of misfortune to occult human agency\".\nEmma Wilby says folk magicians in Europe were viewed ambivalently by communities, and were considered as capable of harming as of healing, which could lead to their being accused as malevolent witches. She suggests some English \"witches\" convicted of consorting with demons may have been cunning folk whose supposed fairy familiars had been demonised.\nHutton says that magical healers \"were sometimes denounced as witches, but seem to have made up a minority of the accused in any area studied\". Likewise, Davies says \"relatively few cunning-folk were prosecuted under secular statutes for witchcraft\" and were dealt with more leniently than alleged witches. The Constitutio Criminalis Carolina (1532) of the Holy Roman Empire, and the Danish Witchcraft Act of 1617, stated that workers of folk magic should be dealt with differently from witches. It was suggested by Richard Horsley that 'diviner-healers' () made up a significant proportion of those tried for witchcraft in France and Switzerland, but more recent surveys conclude that they made up less than 2% of the accused. However, \u00c9va P\u00f3cs says that half the accused witches in Hungary seem to have been healers, and Kathleen Stokker says the \"vast majority\" of Norway's accused witches were folk healers.\nWitch-hunts and thwarting witchcraft.\nSocieties that believe (or believed) in witchcraft may also believe that it can be thwarted in various ways. One common way is to use protective magic or counter-magic, often with the help of magical healers such as cunning folk or witch-doctors. This includes performing rituals, reciting charms, or the use of talismans, amulets, anti-witch marks, witch bottles, witch balls, and burying objects such as horse skulls inside the walls of buildings. Another believed cure for bewitchment is to persuade or force the alleged witch to lift their spell. Often, people have attempted to thwart the witchcraft by physically punishing the alleged witch, such as by banishing, wounding, torturing or killing them. Hutton wrote that \"In most societies, however, a formal and legal remedy was preferred to this sort of private action\", whereby the alleged witch would be prosecuted and then formally punished if found guilty.\nAccusations of witchcraft.\nThroughout the world, accusations of witchcraft are often linked to social and economic tensions. Females are most often accused, especially in more male-dominated societies like 16th-century America. However, in some cultures it was mostly males, such as in 17th-century Iceland. In many societies, accusations are directed mainly against the elderly, but in others age is not a factor, and in some cultures it is mainly adolescents who are accused. \n\u00c9va P\u00f3cs writes that reasons for accusations of witchcraft fall into four general categories. The first three of which were proposed by Richard Kieckhefer, and the fourth added by Christina Larner:\nModern witch-hunts.\nWitch-hunts, scapegoating, and the shunning or murder of suspected witches still occurs. Many cultures worldwide continue to have a belief in the concept of \"witchcraft\" or malevolent magic.\nApart from extrajudicial violence, state-sanctioned execution also occurs in some jurisdictions. For instance, in Saudi Arabia practicing witchcraft and sorcery is a crime punishable by death and the country has executed people for this crime as recently as 2014.\nWitchcraft-related violence is often discussed as a serious issue in the broader context of violence against women. In Tanzania, an estimated 500 older women are murdered each year following accusations of witchcraft or accusations of being a witch, according to a 2014 World Health Organization report.\nChildren who live in some regions of the world, such as parts of Africa, are also vulnerable to violence stemming from witchcraft accusations. Such incidents have also occurred in immigrant communities in Britain, including the much publicized case of the murder of Victoria Climbi\u00e9.\nReligious perspectives.\nAncient Mesopotamian religion.\nMagic was an important part of ancient Mesopotamian religion and society, which distinguished between 'good' (helpful) and 'bad' (harmful) rites. In ancient Mesopotamia, practitioners mainly used counter-magic against witchcraft (\"ki\u0161p\u016b\"); the law codes also prescribed the death penalty for those found guilty of witchcraft. According to Tzvi Abusch, ancient Mesopotamian ideas about witches and witchcraft shifted over time, and the early stages were \"comparable to the archaic shamanistic stage of European witchcraft\". In this early stage, witches were not necessarily considered evil, but took 'white' and 'black' forms, could help others using magic and medical knowledge, generally lived in rural areas, and sometimes exhibited ecstatic behavior.\nIn ancient Mesopotamia, a witch (m. \"ka\u0161\u0161\u0101pu\", f. \"ka\u0161\u0161\u0101ptu\", from \"ka\u0161\u0101pu\" ['to bewitch']) was \"usually regarded as an anti-social and illegitimate practitioner of destructive magic ... whose activities were motivated by malice and evil intent and who was opposed by the \"a\u0161ipu\", an exorcist or incantation-priest\". These \"a\u0161ipu\" were predominantly male representatives of the state religion, whose main role was to work magic against harmful supernatural forces such as demons. The stereotypical witch mentioned in the sources tended to be those of low status who were weak or otherwise marginalized, including women, foreigners, actors, and peddlers.\nThe Code of Hammurabi (18th century BCE) allowed someone accused of harmful magic-practice to undergo trial by ordeal\u2014by jumping into a holy river. If they drowned, they were deemed guilty, and the accuser inherited the guilty person's estate. If they survived, the \"accuser's\" estate was handed over instead.\nThe \"Maql\u00fb\" (\"burning\") is an ancient Akkadian text written early in the first millennium BCE, which sets out a Mesopotamian anti-witchcraft ritual. This lengthy ritual includes invoking various gods, burning an effigy of the witch, then dousing and disposing of the remains.\nAbrahamic religions.\nThe historical development of witchcraft in the Middle East shows a multi-stage process shaped by culture, spirituality, and societal norms. Ancient witchcraft in the Middle East intertwined mysticism with nature through rituals and incantations aligned with local beliefs. The position of magic among ancient Jews and within Judaism was complex, with some forms accepted as mysticism and others disapproved of as heresy. The medieval Middle East experienced shifting perceptions of witchcraft under Islamic and Christian influences, sometimes revered for healing and other times condemned as heresy.\nJewish.\nJewish attitudes toward witchcraft were rooted in its association with idolatry and necromancy, and some rabbis even practiced forms of magic themselves. References to witchcraft in the Hebrew Bible highlighted strong condemnations rooted in the \"abomination\" of magical practices. Christianity later similarly condemned witchcraft, considering it an abomination and using select verses to justify witch hunting during the early modern period.\nChristian.\nHistorically, the Christian concept of witchcraft derives from Old Testament laws against it. In medieval and early-modern Europe, many Christians believed in magic. As opposed to the helpful magic of the cunning folk, witchcraft was seen as evil and associated with Satan and devil worship. This often resulted in deaths, torture and scapegoating (casting blame for misfortune), and many years of large-scale witch trials and witch hunts, especially in Protestant Europe, before largely ending during the Age of Enlightenment. Christian views are diverse, ranging from intense belief and opposition (especially by Christian fundamentalists) to non-belief. During the Age of Colonialism, many cultures were exposed to the Western world via colonialism, usually accompanied by intensive Christian missionary activity (see Christianization). In these cultures, beliefs about witchcraft were partly influenced by the prevailing Western concepts of the time.\nIn Christianity, sorcery came to be associated with heresy and apostasy and viewed as evil. Among Catholics, Protestants, and the secular leadership of late-medieval/early-modern Europe, fears about witchcraft rose to fever pitch and sometimes led to large-scale witch hunts. The fifteenth century saw a dramatic rise in awareness and terror of witchcraft. Tens of thousands of people were executed, and others were imprisoned, tortured, banished, and had lands and possessions confiscated. The majority of those accused were women, though in some regions the majority were men.https:// In Scots, the word \"warlock\" came to be used as the male equivalent of witch (which can be male or female, but is used predominantly for females).\nThe \"Malleus Maleficarum\" (Hammer of the Witches) was a witch-hunting manual written in 1486 by German monk-inquisitors Heinrich Kramer and Jacob Sprenger. It was used by both Catholics and Protestants for several hundred years, outlining how to identify a witch, what makes a woman more likely than a man to be a witch, how to put a witch on trial, and how to punish a witch. The book defines a witch as evil and typically female. It became the handbook for secular courts throughout Europe, but was not used by the Inquisition, which even cautioned against relying on it. It was the most sold book in Europe for over 100 years (after the Christian Bible).\nIslamic.\nIslamic perspectives on magic encompass a wide range of practices, with belief in black magic and the evil eye coexisting alongside strict prohibitions against its practice. The Quran acknowledges the existence of magic and seeks protection from its harm. Islam's stance is against the practice of magic, considering it forbidden, and emphasizes miracles rather than magic or witchcraft. The historical continuity of witchcraft in the Middle East underlines the complex interaction between spiritual beliefs and societal norms across different cultures and epochs.\nModern paganism.\nDuring the 20th century, interest in witchcraft rose in English-speaking and European countries. From the 1920s, Margaret Murray popularized the 'witch-cult hypothesis': the idea that those persecuted as 'witches' in early modern Europe were followers of a benevolent pagan religion that had survived the Christianization of Europe. This has been discredited by further historical research.\nFrom the 1930s, occult neopagan groups began to emerge who called their religion a kind of 'witchcraft'. They were initiatory secret societies inspired by Murray's 'witch cult' theory, ceremonial magic, Aleister Crowley's Thelema, and historical paganism. The biggest religious movement to emerge from this is Wicca. Today, some Wiccans and members of related traditions self-identify as \"witches\" and use the term \"witchcraft\" for their magico-religious beliefs and practices, primarily in Western anglophone countries.\nRegional perspectives.\nA 2022 study found that belief in witchcraft, as in the use of malevolent magic or powers, is still widespread in some parts of the world. It found that belief in witchcraft varied from 9% of people in some countries to 90% in others, and was linked to cultural and socioeconomic factors. Stronger belief in witchcraft correlated with poorer economic development, weak institutions, lower levels of education, lower life expectancy, lower life satisfaction, and high religiosity.\nIt contrasted two hypotheses about future changes in witchcraft belief:\nAfrica.\nAfrican witchcraft encompasses various beliefs and practices. These beliefs often play a significant role in shaping social dynamics and can influence how communities address challenges and seek spiritual assistance. Much of what \"witchcraft\" represents in Africa has been susceptible to misunderstandings and confusion, due to a tendency among western scholars to approach the subject through a comparative lens \"vis-a-vis\" European witchcraft. For example, the Maka people of Cameroon believe in an occult force known as \"djambe\", that dwells inside a person. It is often translated as \"witchcraft\" or \"sorcery\", but it has a broader meaning that encompasses supernatural harm, healing and shapeshifting; this highlights the problem of using European terms for African concepts.\nWhile some 19th\u201320th century European colonialists tried to stamp out witch-hunting in Africa by introducing laws banning accusations of witchcraft, some former African colonies introduced laws banning witchcraft after they gained independence. This has produced an environment that encourages persecution of suspected witches.\nIn the Central African Republic, hundreds of people are convicted of witchcraft yearly, with reports of violence against accused women. The Democratic Republic of the Congo witnessed a disturbing trend of child witchcraft accusations in Kinshasa, leading to abuse and exorcisms supervised by self-styled pastors. In Ghana, there are several \"witch camps\", where women accused of witchcraft can seek refuge, though the government plans to close them.\nIn west Kenya, there have been cases of accused witches being burned to death in their homes by mobs. Malawi faces a similar issue of child witchcraft accusations, with traditional healers and some Christian counterparts involved in exorcisms, causing abandonment and abuse of children. In Nigeria, Pentecostal pastors have intertwined Christianity with witchcraft beliefs for profit, leading to the torture and killing of accused children. Sierra Leone's Mende people see witchcraft convictions as beneficial, as the accused receive support and care from the community.\nLastly, in Zulu culture, healers known as s protect people from witchcraft and evil spirits through divination, rituals and mediumship. However, concerns arise regarding the training and authenticity of some sangomas.\nIn parts of Africa, beliefs about illness being caused by witchcraft continue to fuel suspicion of modern medicine, with serious healthcare consequences. HIV/AIDS and Ebola are two examples of often-lethal infectious disease epidemics whose medical care and containment has been severely hampered by regional beliefs in witchcraft. Other severe medical conditions whose treatment is hampered in this way include tuberculosis, leprosy, epilepsy and the common severe bacterial Buruli ulcer.\nAmericas.\nNorth America.\nNorth America hosts a diverse array of beliefs about witchcraft, some of which have evolved through interactions between cultures.\nNative American peoples such as the Cherokee, Hopi, the Navajo among others, believed in malevolent \"witch\" figures who could harm their communities by supernatural means; this was often punished harshly, including by execution. In these communities, medicine people were healers and protectors against witchcraft.\nThe term \"witchcraft\" arrived with European colonists, along with European views on witchcraft. This term would be adopted by many Indigenous communities for their own beliefs about harmful magic and harmful supernatural powers. Witch hunts took place among Christian European settlers in colonial America and the United States, most infamously the Salem witch trials in Massachusetts. These trials led to the execution of numerous individuals accused of practicing witchcraft. Despite changes in laws and perspectives over time, accusations of witchcraft persisted into the 19th century in some regions, such as Tennessee, where prosecutions occurred as late as 1833. \nSome North American witchcraft beliefs were influenced by beliefs about witchcraft in Latin America, and by African witchcraft beliefs through the slave trade. Native American cultures adopted the term for their own witchcraft beliefs. Neopagan witchcraft practices such as Wicca then emerged in the mid-20th century.\nLatin America.\nWitchcraft beliefs in Latin America are influenced by Spanish Catholic, Indigenous, and African beliefs. In Colonial Mexico, the Mexican Inquisition showed little concern for witchcraft; the Spanish Inquisitors treated witchcraft accusations as a \"religious problem that could be resolved through confession and absolution\". Anthropologist Ruth Behar writes that Mexican Inquisition cases \"hint at a fascinating conjecture of sexuality, witchcraft, and religion, in which Spanish, indigenous, and African cultures converged\". There are cases where European women and Indigenous women were accused of collaborating to work \"love magic\" or \"sexual witchcraft\" against men in colonial Mexico. According to anthropology professor Laura Lewis, \"witchcraft\" in colonial Mexico represented an \"affirmation of hegemony\" for women and especially Indigenous women over their white male counterparts in the \"casta\" system.\nBelief in witchcraft is a constant in the history of colonial Brazil, for example the several denunciations and confessions given to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith of Bahia (1591\u20131593), Pernambuco and Para\u00edba (1593\u20131595).\n\"Brujer\u00eda\", often called a Latin American form of witchcraft, is a syncretic Afro-Caribbean tradition that combines Indigenous religious and magical practices from the Caribbean, together with Catholicism, and European witchcraft. The tradition and terminology is considered to encompass both helpful and harmful practices. A male practitioner is called a , a female practitioner, a . Healers may be further distinguished by the terms or , a man or woman who performs (\"little works\") and (\"large treatments\") to promote or restore health, bring fortune or misfortune, deal with unrequited love, and more serious concerns. Sorcery usually involves reference to an entity referred to as the or .\nAsia.\nEast Asia.\nIn Chinese culture, the practice of \"Gong Tau\" involves black magic for purposes such as revenge and financial assistance. Japanese folklore features witch figures who employ foxes as familiars. Korean history includes instances of individuals being condemned for using spells. The Philippines has its own tradition of Philippine witches, distinct from Western portrayals, with their practices often countered by indigenous Philippine shamans.\nMiddle East.\nWitchcraft beliefs in the Middle East have a long history, and magic was a part of the ancient cultures and religions of the region. \nIn ancient Mesopotamia (Sumeria, Assyria, Babylonia), a witch (m. \"ka\u0161\u0161\u0101pu\", f. \"ka\u0161\u0161\u0101ptu\") was \"usually regarded as an anti-social and illegitimate practitioner of destructive magic ... motivated by malice and evil intent\". Ancient Mesopotamian societies mainly used counter-magic against witchcraft (\"ki\u0161p\u016b\"), but the law codes also prescribed the death penalty for those found guilty of witchcraft. \nFor the ancient Hittites, magic could only be sanctioned by the state, and accusations of witchcraft were often used to control political enemies. \nAs the ancient Hebrews focused on their worship on Yahweh, Judaism clearly distinguished between forms of magic and mystical practices which were accepted, and those which were viewed as forbidden or heretical, and thus \"witchcraft\". \nIn the medieval Middle East, under Islamic and Christian influences, witchcraft's perception fluctuated between healing and heresy, revered by some and condemned by others. In the present day diverse witchcraft communities have emerged.\nEurope.\nAncient Roman world.\nEuropean belief in witchcraft can be traced back to classical antiquity, when concepts of magic and religion were closely related. During the pagan era of ancient Rome, there were laws against harmful magic. According to Pliny, the 5th century BCE laws of the Twelve Tables laid down penalties for uttering harmful incantations and for stealing the fruitfulness of someone else's crops by magic. The only recorded trial involving this law was that of Gaius Furius Cresimus.\nThe Classical Latin word meant both poisoning and causing harm by magic (such as magic potions), although ancient people would not have distinguished between the two. In 331\u00a0BCE, a deadly epidemic hit Rome and at least 170 women were executed for causing it by \"veneficium\". In 184\u2013180 BCE, another epidemic hit Italy, and about 5,000 were executed for \"veneficium\". If the reports are accurate, writes Hutton, \"then the Republican Romans hunted witches on a scale unknown anywhere else in the ancient world\".\nUnder the \"Lex Cornelia de sicariis et veneficis\" of 81\u00a0BCE, killing by \"veneficium\" carried the death penalty. During the early Imperial era, the \"Lex Cornelia\" began to be used more broadly against other kinds of magic, including sacrifices made for evil purposes. The magicians were to be burnt at the stake.\nWitch characters\u2014women who work powerful evil magic\u2014appear in ancient Roman literature from the first century BCE onward. They are typically hags who chant harmful incantations; make poisonous potions from herbs and the body parts of animals and humans; sacrifice children; raise the dead; can control the natural world; can shapeshift themselves and others into animals; and invoke underworld deities and spirits. They include Lucan's Erichtho, Horace's Canidia, Ovid's Dipsas, and Apuleius's Meroe.\nEarly modern and contemporary Europe.\nBy the early modern period, major witch hunts and witch trials began to take place in Europe, partly fueled by religious tensions, societal anxieties, and economic upheaval. One influential text was the \"Malleus Maleficarum\", a 1486 treatise that provided a framework for identifying, prosecuting, and punishing witches. Witches were typically seen as people who caused harm or misfortune through black magic, and were sometimes believed to have made a pact with the Devil. Usually, accusations of witchcraft were made by neighbors and followed from social tensions. Accusations were often made against marginalized individuals, women, the elderly, and those who did not conform to societal norms. Women made accusations as often as men. The common people believed that magical healers (called 'cunning folk' or 'wise people') could undo bewitchment. Hutton says that magical healers were sometimes denounced as witches themselves, \"but seem to have made up a minority of the accused in any area studied\". The witch-craze reached its peak between the 16th and 17th centuries, resulting in the execution of tens of thousands of people. This dark period of history reflects the confluence of superstition, fear, and authority, as well as the societal tendency to find scapegoats for complex problems. A feminist interpretation of the witch trials is that misogynist views led to the association of women and malevolent witchcraft.\nDuring the 16th century and mid 18th century Scotland had 4000-6000 prosecutions against accused witches, a much higher rate then the European average.\nRussia also experienced its own iteration of witchcraft trials during the 17th century. Witches were often accused of sorcery and engaging in supernatural activities, leading to their excommunication and execution. The blending of ecclesiastical and secular jurisdictions in Russia's approach to witchcraft trials highlighted the intertwined nature of religious and political power during that time. As the 17th century progressed, the fear of witches shifted from mere superstition to a tool for political manipulation, with accusations used to target individuals who posed threats to the ruling elite.\nSince the 1940s, neopagan witchcraft movements have emerged in Europe, seeking to revive and reinterpret ancient pagan and mystical practices. Wicca, pioneered by Gerald Gardner, is the most influential. Drawing inspiration from ceremonial magic, historical paganism, and the now-discredited witch-cult theory, Wicca emphasizes a connection to nature, the divine, and personal growth. Similarly, Stregheria in Italy reflects a desire to reconnect with the country's pagan past. Many of these neopagans self-identify as \"witches\". Neopagan witchcraft in Europe encompasses a wide range of traditions.\nOceania.\nBeliefs in witchcraft and sorcery are widespread across Oceania, where traditional spiritual systems often coexist with introduced religions such as Christianity. In many societies, witchcraft serves as an explanation for illness, death, or misfortune, and may be associated with social tensions or unresolved conflicts.\nIn the Cook Islands, the M\u0101ori term for black magic is \"purepure\". Practitioners known as \"ta\u02bbunga\" historically served as priests, healers, and spiritual advisors. They were believed to possess sacred knowledge and were responsible for conducting rituals, healing the sick, and maintaining spiritual balance within the community.\nIn Papua New Guinea, belief in witchcraft\u2014often referred to locally as \"sanguma\"\u2014remains deeply ingrained in many communities, particularly in the Highlands region. Sorcery is commonly blamed for unexplained deaths, illness, crop failure, or other misfortunes. It is estimated that 50 to 150 people are killed each year in the country as a result of witchcraft accusations. In 2008, reports indicated that more than fifty individuals were killed in two Highlands provinces alone for allegedly practicing sorcery. Victims are often women, and attacks may involve torture, public shaming, or execution. Although the government repealed the Sorcery Act in 2013, which previously allowed sorcery as a defense in murder cases, enforcement of protective laws remains inconsistent, and community-led violence continues.\nIn Milne Bay Province, including the Samarai Islands, witchcraft beliefs persist, but violence against the accused is significantly lower compared to the Highlands. Anthropological research suggests that local interpretations of witchcraft in these areas are less associated with malevolence and more integrated into broader spiritual and cultural practices. This has been linked to greater social standing for women and fewer gender-based witchcraft accusations.\nOther parts of Oceania, including Fiji, Tonga, and Samoa, also maintain traditions involving spiritual power and magical influence. In Fiji, for example, concepts such as \"valavala vakalou\" (spiritual acts) and traditional healing practices are still recognized in some rural areas. However, the influence of Christianity and formal legal systems has reduced the prevalence of witchcraft-related violence. In many Pacific Island societies today, witchcraft is viewed through a cultural or religious lens rather than a criminal one, and cases involving supernatural claims are more likely to be addressed through customary dispute resolution or church-based mediation.\nWitches in art and literature.\nWitches have a long history of being depicted in art, although most of their earliest artistic depictions seem to originate in Early Modern Europe, particularly the Medieval and Renaissance periods. Many scholars attribute their manifestation in art as inspired by texts such as , a demonology-centered work of literature, and , a \"witch-craze\" manual published in 1487, by Heinrich Kramer and Jacob Sprenger. Witches in fiction span a wide array of characterizations. They are typically, but not always, female, and generally depicted as either villains or heroines.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

An inner-ring suburb of Detroit, Warren borders Detroit to the north, roughly north of downtown Detroit. The population was 139,387 at the 2020 census, making Warren the largest community in Macomb County, the third-largest city in Michigan, and Detroit's largest suburb.\nThe city is home to a wide variety of businesses, including the General Motors Technical Center, the United States Army Detroit Arsenal, home of the United States Army TACOM Life Cycle Management Command and the Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC), and the headquarters of Asset Acceptance.\nHistory.\nBeebe's Corners, the original settlement in what would become the city of Warren, was founded in 1830 at the corner of Mound Road and Chicago Road; its first resident was Charles Groesbeck. Beebe's Corners was a carriage stop between Detroit and Utica, and included a distillery, mill, tavern, and trading post. It was not until 1837 that the now-defunct Warren Township was organized around the settlement, first under the name Hickory, then renamed Aba in April 1838, and finally renamed Warren shortly thereafter. It was named for War of 1812 veteran, and frontier cleric, Rev. Abel Warren. However, when it was originally organized the township was named for Rev. Warren, a Methodist Episcopal preacher who left his native New York in 1824 for Shelby Township. He went throughout the present-day Macomb, Lapeer, Oakland, and St. Clair Counties, baptizing, marrying, and burying pioneers of the area, as well as establishing congregations and preaching extensively. He was the first licensed preacher in the State of Michigan.\nAnother version of the source of the city's name claims it was \"named for General Joseph Warren, who fell at the Battle of Bunker Hill.\"\nThe settlement was formally incorporated as the Village of Warren from Warren Township on April 28, 1893, out of one square mile bound by 14 Mile Road and 13 Mile Road to the north and south, and in half-a-mile east and west of Mound Road. The small village grew slowly, and had a population of 582 in 1940 and 727 in 1950, while the larger surrounding township grew at a much quicker pace. Much of this growth was due to the construction of the Chrysler's Truck Assembly plant in 1938, the Detroit Arsenal Tank Plant in 1940 to support the WW II effort, and the General Motors Technical Center between 1949 and 1956.\nThe Red Run and Bear Creek, just small creeks back in the 1800s, has blossomed into an open major inter-county stormdrain flowing through Warren, into the Clinton River, and onwards to Lake St. Clair.\nThe Village of Warren and most of the surrounding Township of Warren, together with Van Dyke, incorporated as a city in 1957, less the city of Center Line, which had incorporated as a village from Warren Township in 1925 and as a city in 1936. Between 1950 and 1960, Warren's population soared from 42,653 to 89,426. This population explosion was largely fueled by the post-WWII Baby Boom and later, by white flight from its southern neighbor of Detroit in that decade. This change in population continued into the next decade when the city's population doubled again, ultimately reaching a high of 179,000 in 1970.\nHistorically, Warren was a sundown town: an all-white municipality that excluded non-whites through a combination of discriminatory practices, local ordinances, and violence. In 1970, Warren had a population of 180,000, with only 28 minority families, most of whom lived on a U.S. military base. As late as 1974, African Americans were practically nonexistent in Warren, In 2000 Warren had less than 3% Black population, compared to 80% in adjacent Detroit.\nList of mayors in Warren, Michigan.\nThe following is a list of the previous mayors of the city. The current mayor is Lori Stone. Mayoral elections are currently non-partisan.\nGeography.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. The city covers a square (from 8 Mile Road to 14 Mile Road, south to north) in the southwest corner of Macomb County (minus the city of Center Line, which is a small city totally enclosed within Warren). Warren shares its entire southern border with the northern border of the Detroit city limits. Other cities bordering Warren are Hazel Park and Madison Heights to the west, Sterling Heights to the north, and Fraser, Roseville, and Eastpointe to the east.\nClimate.\nWarren features a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Dfa\"). Summers are somewhat hot with temperatures exceeding on average 8.6 days. Winters are cold, with temperatures not rising above freezing on 39.1 days annually, while dropping to or below on average 1.2 days a year.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2020 census.\nAs of the 2020 census, there were 139,387 people, 54,933 households, and 34,601 families residing in the city.

Warren was one of the fastest-growing municipalities in the country between 1940 and 1970, roughly doubling its population every 10 years. In 1940 the official population of Warren Township was 22,146; in 1950, it was 42,653; in 1960, after Warren Township had become the City of Warren, population had risen to 89,240; and by 1970 it had grown to 179,260.\nIn the late 20th century, Warren was one of the fastest-declining cities in population in the country. After peaking in 1970, the city\u2019s population declined by 10% during each of the next two decades (1980: 161,060; 1990: 144,864), then dropped by 4.6% between 1990 and 2000.\nIn 1970, whites made up 99.5% of the city's total population of 179,270; only 838 non-whites lived within the city limits.

He frequently collaborated with his younger sister and fellow astronomer Caroline Herschel. Born in the Electorate of Hanover, he followed his father into the military band of Hanover, before immigrating to Britain in 1757 at the age of 19.\nTaking an interest in astronomy in 1766, Herschel constructed his first large telescope in 1774, after which he spent nine years carrying out sky surveys to investigate double stars. Herschel published catalogues of nebulae in 1802 (2,500 objects) and in 1820 (5,000 objects). The resolving power of the Herschel telescopes revealed that many objects called nebulae in the Messier catalogue were actually clusters of stars. On 13 March 1781 while making observations he made note of a new object in the constellation of Gemini. This would, after several weeks of verification and consultation with other astronomers, be confirmed to be a new planet, eventually given the name of Uranus. This was the first planet to be discovered since antiquity, and Herschel became famous overnight. As a result of this discovery, George III appointed him Court Astronomer. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and grants were provided for the construction of new telescopes.\nHerschel pioneered the use of astronomical spectrophotometry, using prisms and temperature measuring equipment to measure the wavelength distribution of stellar spectra. In the course of these investigations, Herschel discovered infrared radiation.\nOther work included an improved determination of the rotation period of Mars, the discovery that the Martian polar caps vary seasonally, the discovery of Titania and Oberon (moons of Uranus) and Enceladus and Mimas (moons of Saturn). Herschel was made a Knight of the Royal Guelphic Order in 1816. He was the first President of the Royal Astronomical Society when it was founded in 1820. He died in August 1822, and his work was continued by his only son, John Herschel.\nEarly life and musical activities.\nHerschel was born in the Electorate of Hanover in Germany, then part of the Holy Roman Empire, one of ten children of Isaak Herschel and his wife, Anna Ilse Moritzen, of German Lutheran ancestry. His ancestors came from Pirna, in Saxony. Theories that they were Protestants from Bohemia have been questioned by Hamel as the surname Herschel already occurred a century earlier in the very same area in which the family lived.\nHerschel's father was an oboist in the Hanover Military Band. In 1755 the Hanoverian Guards regiment, in whose band Wilhelm and his brother Jakob were engaged as oboists, was ordered to England. At the time the crowns of Great Britain and Hanover were united under King George II. As the threat of war with France loomed, the Hanoverian Guards were recalled from England to defend Hanover.\nAfter they were defeated at the Battle of Hastenbeck, Herschel's father Isaak sent his two sons to seek refuge in England in late 1757. Although his older brother Jakob had received his dismissal from the Hanoverian Guards, Wilhelm was accused of desertion (for which he was pardoned by George III in 1782). Wilhelm, nineteen years old at this time, was a quick student of the English language. In England, he anglicised his name to Frederick William Herschel.\nIn addition to the oboe, he played the violin and harpsichord and later the organ. He composed numerous musical works, including 24 symphonies and many concertos, as well as some church music. Six of his symphonies were recorded in April 2002 by the London Mozart Players, conducted by Matthias Bamert (Chandos 10048).\nHe was head of the Durham Militia band from 1760 to 1761. Herschel moved to Sunderland in 1761; Charles Avison engaged him as the first violin and soloist for his Newcastle orchestra, where he played for one season. In \"Sunderland in the County of Durh: apprill [\"sic\"] 20th 1761\" he wrote his Symphony No. 8 in C Minor. He visited the home of Sir Ralph Milbanke at Halnaby Hall near Darlington in 1760, where he wrote two symphonies, as well as giving performances himself.\nAfter Newcastle, he moved to Leeds and Halifax where he was the first organist at St John the Baptist church (now Halifax Minster).\nIn 1766, Herschel became organist of the Octagon Chapel, Bath, a fashionable chapel in a well-known spa, in which city he was also Director of Public Concerts. He was appointed as the organist in 1766 and gave his introductory concert on 1 January 1767. As the organ was still incomplete, he showed off his versatility by performing his own compositions including a violin concerto, an oboe concerto, and a harpsichord sonata. On 4 October 1767, he performed on the organ for the official opening of the Octagon Chapel.\nHis sister Caroline arrived in England on 24 August 1772 to live with William in New King Street, Bath. The house they shared is now the location of the Herschel Museum of Astronomy. Herschel's brothers Dietrich (1755\u20131827), Alexander (1745\u20131821) and Jakob (1734\u20131792) also appeared as musicians of Bath. In 1780, Herschel was appointed director of the Bath orchestra, with his sister often appearing as soprano soloist.\nAstronomy.\nHerschel's reading in natural philosophy during the 1770s not only indicates his personal interests, but also suggests an intention to be upwardly mobile, both socially and professionally. He was well-positioned to engage with eighteenth-century \"philosophical gentlemen\" or philomaths, of wide-ranging logical and practical tastes.\nHerschel's intellectual curiosity and interest in music eventually led him to astronomy, making his first recorded observation in 1766. After reading Robert Smith's \"Harmonics, or the Philosophy of Musical Sounds\" (1749), he took up Smith's \"A Compleat System of Opticks\" (1738), which described techniques of telescope construction. He also read James Ferguson's \"Astronomy explained upon Sir Isaac Newton's principles and made easy to those who have not studied mathematics\" (1756) and William Emerson's \"The elements of trigonometry\" (1749), \"The elements of optics\" (1768) and \"The principles of mechanics\" (1754).\nHerschel took lessons from a local mirror-builder and having obtained both tools and a level of expertise, started building his own reflecting telescopes. He would spend up to 16 hours a day grinding and polishing the speculum metal primary mirrors. He relied on the assistance of other family members, particularly his sister Caroline and his brother Alexander, a skilled mechanical craftsperson.\nHe \"began to look at the planets and the stars\" in May 1773 and on 1 March 1774 began an astronomical journal by noting his observations of Saturn's rings and the Great Orion Nebula (M42).\nThe English Astronomer Royal Nevil Maskelyne visited the Herschels while they were at Walcot (which they left on 29 September 1777).\nBy 1779, Herschel had also made the acquaintance of Sir William Watson, who invited him to join the Bath Philosophical Society. Herschel became an active member, and through Watson would greatly enlarge his circle of contacts. A few years later, in 1785, Herschel was elected an international member of the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia.\nDouble stars.\nHerschel's early observational work soon focused on the search for pairs of stars that were very close together visually. Astronomers of the era expected that changes over time in the apparent separation and relative location of these stars would provide evidence for both the proper motion of stars and, by means of parallax shifts in their separation, for the distance of stars from the Earth. The latter was a method first suggested by Galileo Galilei.\nFrom the back garden of his house in New King Street, Bath, and using a , (f/13) Newtonian telescope \"with a most capital speculum\" of his own manufacture, in October 1779, Herschel began a systematic search for such stars among \"every star in the Heavens\", with new discoveries listed through 1792. He soon discovered many more binary and multiple stars than expected, and compiled them with careful measurements of their relative positions in two catalogues presented to the Royal Society in London in 1782 (269 double or multiple systems) and 1784 (434 systems). A third catalogue of discoveries made after 1783 was published in 1821 (145 systems).\nThe Rev. John Michell of Thornhill published work in 1767 on the distribution of double stars, and in 1783 on \"dark stars\", that may have influenced Herschel. After Michell's death in 1793, Herschel bought a ten-foot-long, 30-inch reflecting telescope from Michell's estate.\nIn 1797, Herschel measured many of the systems again, and discovered changes in their relative positions that could not be attributed to the parallax caused by the Earth's orbit. He waited until 1802 (in \"Catalogue of 500 new Nebulae, nebulous Stars, planetary Nebulae, and Clusters of Stars; with Remarks on the Construction of the Heavens\") to announce the hypothesis that the two stars were \"binary sidereal systems\" orbiting under mutual gravitational attraction, a hypothesis he confirmed in 1803 in his \"Account of the Changes that have happened, during the last Twenty-five Years, in the relative Situation of Double-stars; with an Investigation of the Cause to which they are owing\". In all, Herschel discovered over 800 confirmed double or multiple star systems, almost all of them physical rather than optical pairs. His theoretical and observational work provided the foundation for modern binary star astronomy; new catalogues adding to his work were not published until after 1820 by Friedrich Wilhelm Struve, James South and John Herschel.\nUranus.\nIn March 1781, during his search for double stars, Herschel noticed an object appearing as a disk. Herschel originally thought it was a comet or a stellar disc, which he believed he might actually resolve. He reported the sighting to Nevil Maskelyne the Astronomer Royal. He made many more observations of it, and afterwards Russian Academician Anders Lexell computed the orbit and found it to be probably planetary.\nHerschel agreed, determining that it must be a planet beyond the orbit of Saturn. He called the new planet the \"Georgian star\" (Georgium sidus) after King George III, which also brought him favour; the name did not stick. In France, where reference to the British king was to be avoided if possible, the planet was known as \"Herschel\" until the name \"Uranus\" was universally adopted. The same year, Herschel was awarded the Copley Medal and elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1782, he was appointed \"The King's Astronomer\" (not to be confused with the Astronomer Royal).\nOn 1 August 1782 Herschel and his sister Caroline moved to Datchet (then in Buckinghamshire but now in Berkshire). There, he continued his work as an astronomer and telescope maker. He achieved an international reputation for their manufacture, profitably selling over 60 completed reflectors to British and Continental astronomers.\nDeep sky surveys.\nFrom 1782 to 1802, and most intensively from 1783 to 1790, Herschel conducted systematic surveys in search of \"deep-sky\" or non-stellar objects with two , telescopes (in combination with his favoured 6-inch-aperture instrument). Excluding duplicated and \"lost\" entries, Herschel ultimately discovered over 2,400 objects defined by him as nebulae. (At that time, nebula was the generic term for any visually diffuse astronomical object, including galaxies beyond the Milky Way, until galaxies were confirmed as extragalactic systems by Edwin Hubble in 1924.)\nHerschel published his discoveries as three catalogues: \"Catalogue of One Thousand New Nebulae and Clusters of Stars\" (1786), \"Catalogue of a Second Thousand New Nebulae and Clusters of Stars\" (1789) and the previously cited \"Catalogue of 500 New Nebulae ...\" (1802). He arranged his discoveries under eight \"classes\": (I) bright nebulae, (II) faint nebulae, (III) very faint nebulae, (IV) planetary nebulae, (V) very large nebulae, (VI) very compressed and rich clusters of stars, (VII) compressed clusters of small and large [faint and bright] stars, and (VIII) coarsely scattered clusters of stars. Herschel's discoveries were supplemented by those of Caroline Herschel (11 objects) and his son John Herschel (1754 objects) and published by him as \"General Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters\" in 1864. This catalogue was later edited by John Dreyer, supplemented with discoveries by many other 19th-century astronomers, and published in 1888 as the \"New General Catalogue\" (abbreviated NGC) of 7,840 deep-sky objects. The NGC numbering is still the most commonly used identifying label for these celestial landmarks.\nHerschel's discoveries later compiled in the New General Catalogue include NGC 12, NGC 13, NGC 14, NGC 16, NGC 23, NGC 24, NGC 1357, and NGC 7457.\nWorks with his sister Caroline Herschel.\nFollowing the death of their father, William suggested that Caroline join him in Bath, England. In 1772, Caroline was first introduced to astronomy by her brother.\nCaroline spent many hours polishing the mirrors of high performance telescopes so that the amount of light captured was maximized. She also copied astronomical catalogues and other publications for William. After William accepted the office of King's Astronomer to George III, Caroline became his constant assistant.\nIn October 1783, a new 20-foot telescope came into service for William. During this time, William was attempting to observe and then record all of the observations. He had to run inside and let his eyes readjust to the artificial light before he could record anything, and then he would have to wait until his eyes were adjusted to the dark before he could observe again. Caroline became his recorder by sitting at a desk near an open window. William would shout out his observations and she would write them down along with any information he needed from a reference book.\nCaroline began to make astronomical discoveries in her own right, particularly comets. In 1783, William built her a small Newtonian reflector telescope, with a handle to make a vertical sweep of the sky. Between 1783 and 1787, she made an independent discovery of M110 (NGC 205), which is the second companion of the Andromeda Galaxy. During the years 1786\u20131797, she discovered or observed eight comets.\nShe found fourteen new nebulae and, at her brother's suggestion, updated and corrected Flamsteed's work detailing the position of stars. She also rediscovered Comet Encke in 1795.\nCaroline Herschel's eight comets were published between 28 August 1782 to 5 February 1787. Five of her comets were published in \"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society\". William was even summoned to Windsor Castle to demonstrate Caroline's comet to the royal family. William recorded this phenomenon himself, terming it \"My Sister's Comet.\" She wrote letters to the Astronomer Royal to announce the discovery of her second comet, and wrote to Joseph Banks upon the discovery of her third and fourth comets.\nThe \"Catalogue of stars taken from Mr Flamsteed's observations\" contained an index of more than 560 stars that had not been previously included. Caroline Herschel was honoured by the Royal Astronomical Society for this work in 1828.\nCaroline also continued to serve as William Herschel's assistant, often taking notes while he observed at the telescope.\nFor her work as William's assistant, she was granted an annual salary of \u00a350 by George III. Her appointment made her the first female in England to be honoured with a government position. It also made her the first woman to be given a salary as an astronomer.\nIn June 1785, owing to damp conditions, William and Caroline moved to Clay Hall in Old Windsor. On 3 April 1786, the Herschels moved to a new residence on Windsor Road in Slough. Herschel lived the rest of his life in this residence, which came to be known as Observatory House. It was demolished in 1963.\nWilliam Herschel's marriage in 1788 caused a lot of tension in the brother-sister relationship. Caroline has been referred to as a bitter, jealous woman who worshipped her brother and resented her sister-in-law for invading her domestic life. With the arrival of Mary, Caroline lost her managerial and social responsibilities in the household, and with them much of her status. Caroline destroyed her journals between the years 1788 to 1798, so her feelings during this period are not entirely known. According to her memoir, Caroline then moved to separate lodgings, but continued to work as her brother's assistant. When her brother and his family were away from their home, she would often return to take care of it for them. In later life, Caroline and Lady Herschel exchanged affectionate letters.\nCaroline continued her astronomical work after William's death in 1822. She worked to verify and confirm his findings as well as putting together catalogues of nebulae. Towards the end of her life, she arranged two-and-a-half thousand nebulae and star clusters into zones of similar polar distances. She did this so that her nephew, John, could re-examine them systematically. Eventually, this list was enlarged and renamed the \"New General Catalogue\". In 1828, she was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society for her work.\nHerschel's telescopes.\nThe most common type of telescope at that time was the refracting telescope, which involved the refraction of light through a tube using a convex glass lens.\nThis design was subject to chromatic aberration, a distortion of an image due to the failure of light of different component wavelengths to converge. Optician John Dollond (1706\u20131761) tried to correct for this distortion by combining two separate lenses, but it was still difficult to achieve good resolution for far distant light sources.\nReflector telescopes, invented by Isaac Newton in 1668, used a single concave mirror rather than a convex lens. This avoids chromatic aberration. The concave mirror gathered more light than a lens, reflecting it onto a flat mirror at the end of the telescope for viewing. A smaller mirror could provide greater magnification and a larger field of view than a convex lens. Newton's first mirror was 1.3 inches in diameter; such mirrors were rarely more than 3 inches in diameter.\nBecause of the poor reflectivity of mirrors made of speculum metal, Herschel eliminated the small diagonal mirror of a standard newtonian reflector from his design and tilted his primary mirror so he could view the formed image directly. This \"front view\" design has come to be called the Herschelian telescope.\nThe creation of larger, symmetrical mirrors was extremely difficult. Any flaw would result in a blurred image. Because no one else was making mirrors of the size and magnification desired by Herschel, he determined to make his own. This was no small undertaking. He was assisted by his sister Caroline and other family members. Caroline Herschel described the pouring of a 30-foot-focal-length mirror:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A day was set apart for casting, and the metal was in the furnace, but unfortunately it began to leak at the moment when ready for pouring, and both my brothers and the caster with his men were obliged to run out at opposite doors, for the stone flooring (which ought to have been taken up) flew about in all directions, as high as the ceiling. My poor brother fell, exhausted with heat and exertion, on a heap of brickbats. Before the second casting was attempted, everything which could ensure success had been attended to, and a very perfect metal was found in the mould, which had cracked in the cooling.\nHerschel is reported to have cast, ground, and polished more than four hundred mirrors for telescopes, varying in size from 6 to 48 inches in diameter. Herschel and his assistants built and sold at least sixty complete telescopes of various sizes.\nCommissions for the making and selling of mirrors and telescopes provided Herschel with an additional source of income. The King of Spain reportedly paid \u00a33,150 for a telescope.\nAn essential part of constructing and maintaining telescopes was the grinding and polishing of their mirrors. This had to be done repeatedly, whenever the mirrors deformed or tarnished during use.\nThe only way to test the accuracy of a mirror was to use it.\n40-foot telescope.\nThe largest and most famous of Herschel's telescopes was a reflecting telescope with a 49&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442-inch-diameter (1.26 m) primary mirror and a focal length. The 40-foot telescope was, at that time, the largest scientific instrument that had been built. It was hailed as a triumph of \"human perseverance and zeal for the sublimest science\".\nIn 1785 Herschel approached King George for money to cover the cost of building the 40-foot telescope. He received \u00a34,000. Without royal patronage, the telescope could not have been created. As it was, it took five years, and went over budget.\nThe Herschel home in Slough became a scramble of \"labourers and workmen, smiths and carpenters\". A 40-foot telescope tube had to be cast of iron. The tube was large enough to walk through. Mirror blanks were poured from Speculum metal, a mix of copper and tin. They were almost in diameter and weighed . When the first disk deformed due to its weight, a second thicker one was made with a higher content of copper. The mirrors had to be hand-polished, a painstaking process. A mirror was repeatedly put into the telescope and removed again to ensure that it was properly formed. When a mirror deformed or tarnished, it had to be removed, repolished and replaced in the apparatus. A huge rotating platform was built to support the telescope, enabling it to be repositioned by assistants as a sweep progressed. A platform near the top of the tube enabled the viewer to look down into the tube and view the resulting image.\nIn 1789, shortly after this instrument was operational, Herschel discovered a new moon of Saturn: Mimas, only in diameter. Discovery of a second moon (Enceladus) followed, within the first month of observation.\nThe telescope proved very cumbersome, and in spite of its size, not very effective at showing clearer images. Herschel's technological innovations had taken him to the limits of what was possible with the technology of his day. The 40-foot would not be improved upon until the Victorians developed techniques for the precision engineering of large, high-quality mirrors. \nWilliam Herschel was disappointed with it.\nMost of Herschel's observations were done with a smaller , reflector. Nonetheless, the 40-foot caught the public imagination. It inspired scientists and writers including Erasmus Darwin and William Blake, and impressed foreign tourists and French dignitaries. King George was pleased.\nHerschel discovered that unfilled telescope apertures can be used to obtain high angular resolution, something which became the essential basis for interferometric imaging in astronomy (in particular aperture masking interferometry and hypertelescopes).\nReconstruction of the 20-foot telescope.\nIn 2012, the BBC television programme \"Stargazing Live\" built a replica of the 20-foot telescope using Herschel's original plans but modern materials. It is to be considered a close modern approximation rather than an exact replica. A modern glass mirror was used, the frame uses metal scaffolding and the tube is a sewer pipe. The telescope was shown on the programme in January 2013 and stands on the Art, Design, and Technology campus of the University of Derby where it will be used for educational purposes.\nLife on other celestial bodies.\nHerschel was sure that he had found ample evidence of life on the Moon and compared it to the English countryside. He did not refrain himself from theorising that the other planets were populated, with a special interest in Mars, which was in line with most of his contemporary scientists. During Herschel's time, scientists tended to believe in a plurality of civilised worlds; in contrast, most religious thinkers referred to unique properties of the Earth.\nHerschel went so far as to speculate that the interior of the Sun was populated.\nSunspots, climate and wheat yields.\nHerschel examined the correlation of solar variation and solar cycle and climate. Over a period of 40 years (1779\u20131818), Herschel regularly observed sunspots and their variations in number, form and size. Most of his observations took place in a period of low solar activity, the Dalton Minimum, when sunspots were relatively few in number. This was one of the reasons why Herschel was not able to identify the standard 11-year period in solar activity.\nHerschel compared his observations with the series of wheat prices published by Adam Smith in \"The Wealth of Nations\".\nIn 1801, Herschel reported his findings to the Royal Society and indicated five prolonged periods of few sunspots correlated with the price of wheat. Herschel's study was ridiculed by some of his contemporaries but did initiate further attempts to find a correlation. Later in the 19th century, William Stanley Jevons proposed the 11-year cycle with Herschel's basic idea of a correlation between the low number of sunspots and lower yields explaining recurring booms and slumps in the economy.\nHerschel's speculation on a connection between sunspots and regional climate, using the market price of wheat as a proxy, continues to be cited.\nAccording to one study, the influence of solar activity can actually be seen on the historical wheat market in England over ten solar cycles between 1600 and 1700. The evaluation is controversial and the significance of the correlation is doubted by some scientists.\nFurther discoveries.\nIn his later career, Herschel discovered two moons of Saturn, Mimas and Enceladus; as well as two moons of Uranus, Titania and Oberon. He did not give these moons their names; they were named by his son John in 1847 and 1852, respectively, after his death. Herschel measured the axial tilt of Mars and discovered that the Martian ice caps, first observed by Giovanni Domenico Cassini (1666) and Christiaan Huygens (1672), changed size with that planet's seasons. It has been suggested that Herschel discovered rings around Uranus.\nHerschel introduced but did not create the word \"asteroid\", meaning \"star-like\" (from the Greek \"asteroeides\", \"aster\" \"star\" + \"-eidos\" \"form, shape\"), in 1802 (shortly after Olbers discovered the second minor planet, 2 Pallas, in late March), to describe the star-like appearance of the small moons of the giant planets and of the minor planets; the planets all show discs, by comparison. By the 1850s 'asteroid' became a standard term for describing certain minor planets.\nFrom studying the proper motion of stars, the nature and extent of the solar motion was first demonstrated by Herschel in 1783, along with first determining the direction for the solar apex to Lambda Herculis, only 10\u00b0 away from today's accepted position.\nHerschel also studied the structure of the Milky Way and was the first to propose a model of the galaxy based on observation and measurement. He concluded that it was in the shape of a disk, but incorrectly assumed that the Sun was in the centre of the disk. This heliocentric view was eventually replaced by galactocentrism due to the work of Harlow Shapley, Heber Doust Curtis and Edwin Hubble in the 20th century. All three men used significantly more far-reaching and accurate telescopes than Herschel's.\nDiscovery of infrared radiation in sunlight.\nIn early 1800, Herschel was testing different filters to pass sunlight through, and noticed that filters of different colours seemed to generate varying amounts of heat. He decided to pass the light through a prism to measure the different colours of light using a thermometer, and in the process, took a measurement just beyond the red end of the visible spectrum. He detected a temperature one degree higher than that of red light. Further experimentation led to Herschel's conclusion that there must be an invisible form of light beyond the visible spectrum, infrared. He published these results in April 1800.\nBiology.\nHerschel used a microscope to establish that coral was not a plant \u2013 as many at the time believed \u2013 because it lacked the cell walls characteristic of plants. It is in fact an animal, a marine invertebrate.\nFamily and death.\nOn 8 May 1788, William Herschel married the widow Mary Pitt (n\u00e9e Baldwin) at St Laurence's Church, Upton in Slough. They had one child, John, born at Observatory House on 7 March 1792. William's personal background and rise as man of science had a profound impact on the upbringing of his son and grandchildren. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1788. In 1816, William was made a Knight of the Royal Guelphic Order by the Prince Regent and was accorded the honorary title 'Sir' although this was not the equivalent of an official British knighthood. \nHe helped to found the Astronomical Society of London in 1820, which in 1831 received a royal charter and became the Royal Astronomical Society. In 1813, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\nOn 25 August 1822, Herschel died at Observatory House, Windsor Road, Slough, Buckinghamshire, after a long illness. Caroline was deeply distressed by his death, and soon after his burial she returned to Hanover, a decision she later regretted. She had lived in England for fifty years. Her interests were much more in line with her nephew John Herschel, also an astronomer, than with her surviving family in Hanover. She continued to work on the organization and cataloguing of nebulae, creating what would later become the basis of the \"New General Catalogue\". She died on 9 January 1848.\nMemorial.\nWilliam Herschel lived most of his life in the town of Slough, then in Buckinghamshire (now in Berkshire). He died in the town and was buried under the tower of the nearby St Laurence's Church, Upton-cum-Chalvey. Herschel's epitaph is:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHerschel is especially honoured in Slough and there are several memorials to him and his discoveries. In 2011 a new bus station, the design of which was inspired by the infrared experiment of William Herschel, was built in the centre of Slough.\nJohn Keats alludes to Herschel's discovery of Uranus in his 1816 sonnet \"On First Looking into Chapman's Homer\": \"Then felt I like some watcher of the skies/ When a new planet swims into his ken.\" Richard Holmes says that Keats \"picks out the finding of Uranus, thirty-five years before, as one of the defining moments of the age.\"\nHis house at 19 New King Street in Bath, Somerset, where he made many telescopes and first observed Uranus, is now home to the Herschel Museum of Astronomy. There is a commemorative plaque of Herschel installed by the Institute of Physics in London. There is a memorial plaque of William near the choir screen in Westminster Abbey.\nMusical works.\nHerschel's complete musical works are as follows:\nVarious vocal works including a \"Te Deum\", psalms, motets and sacred chants along with some catches.\nKeyboard works for organ and harpsichord: \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "33972", "revid": "16185737", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33972", "title": "Wolfgang Pauli", "text": "Austrian\u2013Swiss theoretical physicist (1900\u20131958)\nWolfgang Ernst Pauli ( ; ; 25 April 1900 \u2013 15 December 1958) was an Austrian\u2013Swiss theoretical physicist and a pioneer of quantum mechanics. In 1945, after having been nominated by Albert Einstein, Pauli received the Nobel Prize in Physics \"for the discovery of the Exclusion Principle, also called the Pauli Principle\". The discovery involved spin theory, which is the basis of a theory of the structure of matter. \nTo preserve the conservation of energy in beta decay, Pauli proposed the existence of a small neutral particle, dubbed the neutrino by Enrico Fermi, in 1930. Neutrinos were first detected in 1956.\nBiography.\nFamily.\nWolfgang Ernst Pauli was born on 25 April 1900 in Vienna, the son of Wolfgang Josef Pauli (n\u00e9 Pascheles) and Bertha Camilla Sch\u00fctz. His sister was Hertha Pauli, a writer and actress. His middle name was given in honor of his godfather, physicist Ernst Mach. His paternal grandparents were from prominent Jewish families of Prague; his great-grandfather was the Jewish publisher Wolf Pascheles. Bertha was raised in her mother's Roman Catholic religion; her father was Jewish writer Friedrich Sch\u00fctz. Pauli was also raised as a Roman Catholic.\nEducation.\nPauli attended the D\u00f6blinger-Gymnasium in Vienna, graduating with distinction in 1918. Two months later, he published his first paper, on Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity. He studied under Arnold Sommerfeld at the University of Munich, where he received his Ph.D. in 1921 with a thesis on the quantum theory of ionized diatomic hydrogen (H2+).\nSommerfeld asked Pauli to review the theory of relativity for the \"Encyclopedia of Mathematical Sciences\". Two months after receiving his doctorate, Pauli completed the article, which came to 237 pages. Einstein praised it and published it as a monograph. It remains a standard reference on the subject.\nPauli spent a year at the University of G\u00f6ttingen as an assistant to Max Born, and the following year at the University of Copenhagen.\nCareer.\nFrom 1923 to 1928, Pauli was a lecturer at the University of Hamburg. During this period, he was instrumental in the development of the modern theory of quantum mechanics. In particular, he formulated the exclusion principle and the theory of nonrelativistic spin.\nIn 1928, Pauli was appointed Professor of Theoretical Physics at ETH Zurich in Switzerland. He was awarded the Lorentz Medal in 1930. He held visiting professorships at the University of Michigan in 1931 and the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton in 1935.\nIn 1929, Pauli married K\u00e4the Margarethe Deppner, a cabaret dancer; the marriage was unhappy, ending in divorce after less than a year. He remarried in 1934 to Franziska \"Franca\" Bertram.\nJung.\nAt the end of 1930, immediately after his divorce and his mother's death, Pauli experienced a personal crisis. In January 1932, he consulted psychiatrist and psychotherapist Carl Jung, who also lived near Zurich. Jung immediately began interpreting Pauli's deeply archetypal dreams and Pauli became a collaborator of Jung's. He soon began to critique the epistemology of Jung's theory scientifically, and this contributed to a certain clarification of Jung's ideas, especially about synchronicity. A great many of these discussions are documented in the Pauli/Jung letters, today published as \"Atom and Archetype\". Jung's elaborate analysis of more than 400 of Pauli's dreams is documented in \"Psychology and Alchemy\". In 1933 Pauli published the second part of his book on physics, \"Handbuch der Physik\", which was considered the definitive book on the new field of quantum physics. Robert Oppenheimer called it \"the only adult introduction to quantum mechanics.\"\nLater life and death.\nThe German annexation of Austria in 1938 made Pauli a German citizen, which became a problem for him in 1939 when World War II broke out. In 1940, he tried in vain to obtain Swiss citizenship, which would have allowed him to remain at the ETH. The same year, he moved to the United States and was appointed Professor of Theoretical Physics at the Institute for Advanced Study. In 1946, he became a naturalized US citizen and returned to Zurich, where he remained for the rest of his life. In 1949, he was granted Swiss citizenship.\nIn 1958, Pauli was awarded the Max Planck Medal. The same year, he fell ill with pancreatic cancer. When his last assistant, Charles Enz, visited him at the Rotkreuz hospital in Zurich, Pauli asked him, \"Did you see the room number?\" It was 137. Throughout his life, Pauli had been preoccupied with the question of why the fine-structure constant, a dimensionless fundamental constant, has a value nearly equal to 1/137. Pauli died in that room on 15 December 1958.\nResearch.\nPauli made many important contributions as a physicist, primarily in the field of quantum mechanics. He seldom published papers, preferring lengthy correspondences with colleagues such as Niels Bohr from the University of Copenhagen in Denmark and Werner Heisenberg, with whom he had close friendships. Many of his ideas and results were never published and appeared only in his letters, which were often copied and circulated by their recipients. In 1921 Pauli worked with Bohr to create the Aufbau Principle, which described building up electrons in shells based on the German word for building up, as Bohr was also fluent in German.\nPauli proposed in 1924 a new quantum degree of freedom (or quantum number) with two possible values, to resolve inconsistencies between observed molecular spectra and the developing theory of quantum mechanics. He formulated the Pauli exclusion principle, perhaps his most important work, which stated that no two electrons could exist in the same quantum state, identified by four quantum numbers including his new two-valued degree of freedom. The idea of spin originated with Ralph Kronig. A year later, George Uhlenbeck and Samuel Goudsmit identified Pauli's new degree of freedom as electron spin, in which Pauli for a very long time wrongly refused to believe.\nIn 1926, shortly after Heisenberg published the matrix theory of modern quantum mechanics, Pauli used it to derive the observed spectrum of the hydrogen atom. This result was important in securing credibility for Heisenberg's theory.\nPauli introduced the 2\u00d72 Pauli matrices as a basis of spin operators, thus solving the nonrelativistic theory of spin. This work, including the Pauli equation, is sometimes said to have influenced Paul Dirac in his creation of the Dirac equation for the relativistic electron, though Dirac said that he invented these same matrices himself independently at the time. Dirac invented similar but larger (4x4) spin matrices for use in his relativistic treatment of fermionic spin.\nIn 1930, Pauli considered the problem of beta decay. In a letter of 4 December to Lise Meitner \"et al.\", beginning, \"Dear radioactive ladies and gentlemen\", he proposed the existence of a hitherto unobserved neutral particle with a small mass, no greater than 1% the mass of a proton, to explain the continuous spectrum of beta decay. In 1934, Enrico Fermi incorporated the particle, which he called a neutrino, \"little neutral one\" in Fermi's native Italian, into his theory of beta decay. The neutrino was first confirmed experimentally in 1956 by Frederick Reines and Clyde Cowan, two and a half years before Pauli's death. On receiving the news, he replied by telegram: \"Thanks for message. Everything comes to him who knows how to wait. Pauli.\"\nIn 1940, Pauli re-derived the spin-statistics theorem, a critical result of quantum field theory that states that particles with half-integer spin are fermions, while particles with integer spin are bosons.\nIn 1949, he published a paper on Pauli\u2013Villars regularization: regularization is the term for techniques that modify infinite mathematical integrals to make them finite during calculations, so that one can identify whether the intrinsically infinite quantities in the theory (mass, charge, wavefunction) form a finite and hence calculable set that can be redefined in terms of their experimental values, which criterion is termed renormalization, and which removes infinities from quantum field theories, but also importantly allows the calculation of higher-order corrections in perturbation theory.\nPauli made repeated criticisms of the modern synthesis of evolutionary biology, and his contemporary admirers point to modes of epigenetic inheritance as supporting his arguments.\nPaul Drude in 1900 proposed the first theoretical model for a classical electron moving through a metallic solid. Drude's classical model was also augmented by Pauli and other physicists. Pauli realized that the free electrons in metal must obey the Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics. Using this idea, he developed the theory of paramagnetism in 1926. Pauli said, \"Festk\u00f6rperphysik ist eine Schmutzphysik\"\u2014solid-state physics is the physics of dirt.\nPauli was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1953 and president of the Swiss Physical Society in 1955 for two years. In 1958 he became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.\nPersonality and friendships.\nThe Pauli effect was named after his anecdotal bizarre ability to break experimental equipment simply by being in its vicinity. Pauli was aware of his reputation and was delighted whenever the Pauli effect manifested. These strange occurrences were in line with his controversial investigations into the legitimacy of parapsychology, particularly his collaboration with C. G. Jung on synchronicity. Max Born considered Pauli \"only comparable to Einstein himself... perhaps even greater\". Einstein declared Pauli his \"spiritual heir\".\nPauli was famously a perfectionist. This extended not just to his own work, but also to that of his colleagues. As a result, he became known in the physics community as the \"conscience of physics\", the critic to whom his colleagues were accountable. He could be scathing in his dismissal of any theory he found lacking, often labelling it \"ganz falsch\", \"utterly wrong\".\nBut this was not his most severe criticism, which he reserved for theories or theses so unclearly presented as to be untestable or unevaluatable and thus not properly belonging within the realm of science, even though posing as such. They were worse than wrong because they could not be proved wrong. Famously, he once said of such an unclear paper: \"It is not even wrong!\"\nHis supposed remark when meeting another leading physicist, Paul Ehrenfest, illustrates this notion of an arrogant Pauli. The two met at a conference for the first time. Ehrenfest was familiar with Pauli's papers and quite impressed with them. After a few minutes of conversation, Ehrenfest remarked, \"I think I like your Encyclopedia article [on relativity theory] better than I like you,\" to which Pauli retorted, \"That's strange. With me, regarding you, it is just the opposite.\" The two became very good friends from then on.\nA somewhat warmer picture emerges from this story, which appears in the article on Dirac:\nWerner Heisenberg [in \"Physics and Beyond\", 1971] recollects a friendly conversation among young participants at the 1927 Solvay Conference, about Einstein and Planck's views on religion. Wolfgang Pauli, Heisenberg, and Dirac took part in it. Dirac's contribution was a poignant and clear criticism of the political manipulation of religion, that was much appreciated for its lucidity by Bohr, when Heisenberg reported it to him later. Among other things, Dirac said: \"I cannot understand why we idle discussing religion. If we are honest \u2013 and as scientists honesty is our precise duty \u2013 we cannot help but admit that any religion is a pack of false statements, deprived of any real foundation. The very idea of God is a product of human imagination. [ ... ] I do not recognize any religious myth, at least because they contradict one another. [ ... ]\" Heisenberg's view was tolerant. Pauli had kept silent, after some initial remarks. But when finally he was asked for his opinion, jokingly he said: \"Well, I'd say that also our friend Dirac has got a religion and the first commandment of this religion is 'God does not exist and Paul Dirac is his prophet'\". Everybody burst into laughter, including Dirac.\nMany of Pauli's ideas and results were never published and appeared only in his letters, which were often copied and circulated by their recipients. Pauli may have been unconcerned that much of his work thus went uncredited, but when it came to Heisenberg's world-renowned 1958 lecture at G\u00f6ttingen on their joint work on a unified field theory, and the press release calling Pauli a mere \"assistant to Professor Heisenberg\", Pauli became offended, denouncing Heisenberg's physics prowess. The deterioration of their relationship resulted in Heisenberg ignoring Pauli's funeral, and writing in his autobiography that Pauli's criticisms were overwrought, though ultimately the field theory was proved untenable, validating Pauli's criticisms.\nGeorge Gamow wrote that \"it is just as difficult to find the branch of modern physics in which the Pauli Principle is not used as to find a man as gifted, amiable, and amusing as Wolfgang Pauli was.\"\nPhilosophy and religion.\nIn his discussions with Carl Jung, Pauli developed an ontological theory that has been dubbed the \"Pauli\u2013Jung Conjecture\" and has been seen as a kind of dual-aspect theory. The theory holds that there is \"a psychophysically neutral reality\" and that mental and physical aspects are derivative of this reality. Pauli thought that elements of quantum physics pointed to a deeper reality that might explain the mind/matter gap and wrote, \"we must postulate a cosmic order of nature beyond our control to which \"both\" the outward material objects \"and\" the inward images are subject.\"\nPauli and Jung held that this reality was governed by common principles (\"archetypes\") that appear as psychological phenomena or as physical events. They also held that synchronicities might reveal some of this underlying reality's workings.\nPauli is considered to have been a deist and a mystic. In \"No Time to Be Brief: A Scientific Biography of Wolfgang Pauli\", he is quoted as writing to science historian Shmuel Sambursky, \"In opposition to the monotheist religions \u2013 but in unison with the mysticism of all peoples, including the Jewish mysticism \u2013 I believe that the ultimate reality is not personal.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was one of the earliest cartoonists to work in the American comic book industry, and his series \"The Spirit\" (1940\u20131952) was noted for its experiments in content and form. In 1978, he popularized the term \"graphic novel\" with the publication of his book \"A Contract with God\". He was an early contributor to formal comics studies with his book \"Comics and Sequential Art\" (1985). The Eisner Award was named in his honor and is given to recognize achievements each year in the comics medium; he was one of the three inaugural inductees to the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame.\n1917\u20131936: Early life.\nFamily background.\nEisner's father, Shmuel \"Samuel\" Eisner, was born to Galician Jewish parents on March 6, 1886, in Kolomyia, Austria-Hungary (present-day Ukraine), and was one of eleven children. He aspired to be an artist, and as a teenager painted murals for rich patrons and Catholic churches in Vienna. To avoid conscription in the army, he moved to New York before the outbreak of World War I. There he found getting work difficult, as his English skills were poor. He made what living he could painting backdrops for vaudeville and the Jewish theater.\nEisner's mother, Fannie Ingber, was born to Romanian Jewish parents on April 25, 1891, on a ship bound for the US. Her mother died on her tenth birthday and was quickly followed by her father. An older stepsister thereafter raised her and kept her so busy with chores that she had little time for socializing or schooling; she did what she could later in life to keep knowledge of her illiteracy from her children.\nShmuel and Fannie, who were distant relatives, met through family members. They had three children: son Will Erwin, born on his father's birthday in 1917; son Julian, born February 3, 1921; and daughter Rhoda, born November 2, 1929.\nEarly life.\nEisner was born in Brooklyn. He grew up poor, and the family moved frequently. Young Eisner often got into physical confrontations when subjected to antisemitism from his schoolmates.\nYoung Eisner was tall and of sturdy build, but lacked athletic skills. He was a voracious consumer of pulp magazines and film, including avant-garde films such as those by Man Ray. To his mother's disappointment, Eisner had his father's interest in art, and his father encouraged him by buying him art supplies.\nEisner's mother frequently berated his father for not providing the family a better income, as he went from one job to another. Without success he also tried his hand at such ventures as a furniture retailer and a coat factory. The family situation was especially dire following the Wall Street crash of 1929 that marked the beginning of the Great Depression. In 1930, the situation was so desperate that Eisner's mother demanded that he, at thirteen, find some way to contribute to the family's income. He entered working life selling newspapers on street corners, a competitive job where the toughest boys fought for the best locations.\nEisner attended DeWitt Clinton High School. With influences that included the early 20th-century commercial artist J. C. Leyendecker, he drew for the school newspaper (\"The Clinton News\"), the literary magazine (\"The Magpie\") and the yearbook \"(The Clintonian)\" and did stage design, leading him to consider doing that kind of work for theater. Upon graduation, he studied under Canadian artist George Brandt Bridgman for a year at the Art Students League of New York. Contacts made there led to a position as an advertising writer-cartoonist for the \"New York American\" newspaper. Eisner also drew $10-a-page illustrations for pulp magazines, including \"Western Sheriffs and Outlaws\".\nIn 1936, high-school friend and fellow cartoonist Bob Kane, of future Batman fame, suggested that the 19-year-old Eisner try selling cartoons to the new comic book \"Wow, What A Magazine!\" \"Comic books\" at the time were tabloid-sized collections of comic strip reprints in color. By 1935, they had begun to include occasional new comic strip-like material. \"Wow\" editor Jerry Iger bought an Eisner adventure strip called \"Captain Scott Dalton\", an H. Rider Haggard-styled hero who traveled the world after rare artifacts. Eisner subsequently wrote and drew the pirate strip \"The Flame\" and the secret agent strip \"Harry Karry\" for \"Wow\" as well.\nEisner said that on one occasion a man whom Eisner described as \"a mob type straight out of Damon Runyon, complete with pinkie ring, broken nose, black shirt, and white tie, who claimed to have \"exclusive distribution rights for all Brooklyn\" asked Eisner to draw Tijuana bibles for $3 a page. Eisner said that he declined the offer; he described the decision as \"one of the most difficult moral decisions of my life\".\n1936\u20131941: Comics industry and \"The Spirit\".\nEisner &amp; Iger.\n\"Wow\" lasted four issues (cover-dated July\u2013September and November 1936). After it ended, Eisner and Iger worked together producing and selling original comics material, anticipating that the well of available reprints would soon run dry, though their accounts of how their partnership was founded differ. One of the first such comic-book \"packagers\", their partnership was an immediate success, and the two soon had a stable of comics creators supplying work to Fox Comics, Fiction House, Quality Comics (for whom Eisner co-created such characters as Doll Man and Blackhawk), and others. Turning a profit of $1.50 a page, Eisner claimed that he \"got very rich before I was 22,\" later detailing that in Depression-era 1939 alone, he and Iger \"had split $25,000 between us\", a considerable amount for the time.\nAmong the studio's products was a self-syndicated Sunday comic strip, \"Hawks of the Seas\", that initially reprinted Eisner's old strip \"Wow, What A Magazine!\" feature \"The Flame\" and then continued it with new material. Eisner's original work even crossed the Atlantic, with Eisner drawing the new cover of the October 16, 1937, issue of Boardman Books' comic-strip reprint tabloid \"Okay Comics Weekly.\" Another Eisner &amp; Iger product \u2013 created by Eisner, but soon left to his stable of assistants \u2013 was the 1938 short-form comedy strip \"Archie O'Toole\".\nIn 1939, Eisner was commissioned to create Wonder Man for Victor Fox, an accountant who had previously worked at DC Comics and was becoming a comic book publisher himself. Following Fox's instructions to create a Superman-type character, and using the pen name Willis, Eisner wrote and drew the first issue of \"Wonder Comics.\" Eisner said in interviews throughout his later life that he had protested the derivative nature of the character and story, and that when subpoenaed after National Periodical Publications, the company that would evolve into DC Comics, sued Fox, alleging Wonder Man was an illegal copy of Superman, Eisner testified that this was so, undermining Fox's case; Eisner even depicts himself doing so in his semi-autobiographical graphic novel \"The Dreamer\". However, a transcript of the proceeding, uncovered by comics historian Ken Quattro in 2010, indicates Eisner in fact supported Fox and claimed Wonder Man as an original Eisner creation.\n\"The Spirit\".\nIn \"late '39, just before Christmas time,\" Eisner recalled in 1979, Quality Comics publisher Everett M. \"Busy\" Arnold \"came to me and said that the Sunday newspapers were looking for a way of getting into this comic book boom,\" In a 2004 interview, he elaborated on that meeting:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Busy\" invited me up for lunch one day and introduced me to Henry Martin [sales manager of The Des Moines Register and Tribune Syndicate, who] said, \"The newspapers in this country, particularly the Sunday papers, are looking to compete with comics books, and they would like to get a comic-book insert into the newspapers.\" ... Martin asked if I could do it. ... It meant that I'd have to leave Eisner &amp; Iger [which] was making money; we were very profitable at that time and things were going very well. A hard decision. Anyway, I agreed to do the Sunday comic book and we started discussing the deal [which] was that we'd be partners in the 'Comic Book Section,' as they called it at that time. And also, I would produce two other magazines in partnership with Arnold.\nEisner negotiated an agreement with the syndicate in which Arnold would copyright \"The Spirit,\" but \"[w]ritten down in the contract I had with 'Busy' Arnold\u00a0\u2014and this contract exists today as the basis for my copyright ownership\u2014Arnold agreed that it was my property. They agreed that if we had a split-up in any way, the property would revert to me on that day that happened. My attorney went to 'Busy' Arnold and his family, and they all signed a release agreeing that they would not pursue the question of ownership\". This would include the eventual backup features \"Mr. Mystic\" and \"Lady Luck\".\nSelling his share of their firm to Iger, who would continue to package comics as the S.M. Iger Studio and as Phoenix Features through 1955, for $20,000, Eisner left to create \"The Spirit.\" \"They gave me an adult audience\", Eisner said in 1997, \"and I wanted to write better things than superheroes. Comic books were a ghetto. I sold my part of the enterprise to my associate and then began The Spirit. They wanted an heroic character, a costumed character. They asked me if he'd have a costume. And I put a mask on him and said, 'Yes, he has a costume!'\"\n\"The Spirit\", an initially eight- and later seven-page urban-crimefighter series, ran with the initial backup features \"Mr. Mystic\" and \"Lady Luck\" in a 16-page Sunday supplement (colloquially called \"The Spirit Section\") that was eventually distributed in 20 newspapers with a combined circulation of as many as five million copies. It premiered June 2, 1940, and continued through 1952. Eisner has cited the Spirit story \"Gerhard Shnobble\" as a particular favorite, as it was one of his first attempts at injecting his personal point of view into the series.\n1942\u20131970s: Military publications, \"The Spirit\", and new endeavors.\nWorld War II and \"Joe Dope\".\nEisner was drafted into the U.S. Army in \"late '41, early '42\" and then \"had about another half-year which the government gave me to clean up my affairs before going off\" to fight in World War II. He was assigned to the camp newspaper at Aberdeen Proving Ground, where \"there was also a big training program there, so I got involved in the use of comics for training. ... I finally became a warrant officer, which involved taking a test \u2013 that way you didn't have to go through Officer Candidate School.\"\nEn route to Washington, D.C., he stopped at the Holabird Ordnance Depot in Baltimore, where a mimeographed publication titled \"Army Motors\" was put together. \"Together with the people there ... I helped develop its format. I began doing cartoons \u2013 and we began fashioning a magazine that had the ability to talk to the G.I.s in their language. So I began to use comics as a teaching tool, and when I got to Washington, they assigned me to the business of teaching \u2013 or selling \u2013 preventive maintenance.\"\nEisner then created the educational comic strip and titular character \"Joe Dope\" for \"Army Motors\", and spent four years working in The Pentagon editing the ordnance magazine \"Firepower\" and doing \"all the general illustrations \u2013 that is, cartoons\" for \"Army Motors\". He continued to work on that and its 1950 successor magazine, \"PS, The Preventive Maintenance Monthly\", until 1971. Eisner also illustrated an official Army pamphlet in 1968 and 1969 called \"The M16A1 Rifle\" specifically for troops in Vietnam to help minimize the M16 rifle's notorious early reliability problems with proper maintenance. Eisner's style helped to popularize these officially-distributed works in order to better educate soldiers on equipment maintenance.\nWhile Eisner's later graphic novels were entirely his own work, he had a studio working under his supervision on \"The Spirit\". In particular, letterer Abe Kanegson came up with the distinctive lettering style which Eisner himself would later imitate in his book-length works, and Kanegson would often rewrite Eisner's dialogue.\nEisner's most trusted assistant on \"The Spirit,\" however, was Jules Feiffer, later a renowned cartoonist, playwright and screenwriter in his own right. Eisner later said of their memories of their working methods on the feature, \"You should hear me and Jules Feiffer going at it in a room. 'No, you designed the splash page for this one, then you wrote the ending\u00a0\u2013 I came up with the idea for the story, and you did it up to this point, then I did the next page and this sequence here and...' And I'll be swearing up and down that 'he' wrote the ending on that one. We never agree.\"\nSo trusted were Eisner's assistants that Eisner allowed them to \"ghost\" \"The Spirit\" from the time that he was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1942 until his return to civilian life in 1945. The primary wartime artists were the uncredited Lou Fine and Jack Cole, with future \"Kid Colt, Outlaw\" artist Jack Keller drawing backgrounds. Ghost writers included Manly Wade Wellman and William Woolfolk. The wartime ghosted stories have been reprinted in DC Comics' hardcover collections \"The Spirit Archives\" Vols. 5 to 11 (2001\u20132003), spanning July 1942 to December 1945.\nPost-war comics.\nOn Eisner's return from service and resumption of his role in the studio, he created the bulk of the \"Spirit\" stories on which his reputation was solidified. The post-war years also saw him attempt to launch the comic-strip/comic-book series \"Baseball,\" \"John Law,\" \"Kewpies,\" and \"Nubbin the Shoeshine Boy;\" none succeeded, but some material was recycled into \"The Spirit\".\n\"The Spirit\" ceased publishing in 1952. During the 1960s and 1970s, various publishers reprinted the adventures, often with covers by Eisner and with a few new stories from him.\nAmerican Visuals Corporation.\nDuring his World War II military service, Eisner had introduced the use of comics for training personnel in the publication \"Army Motors\", for which he created the cautionary bumbling soldier Joe Dope, who illustrated various methods of preventive maintenance of various military equipment and weapons. In 1948, while continuing to do \"The Spirit\" and seeing television and other post-war trends eat away at the readership base of newspapers, he formed the American Visuals Corporation in order to produce instructional materials for the government, related agencies, and businesses.\nOne of his longest-running jobs was \"PS, The Preventive Maintenance Monthly,\" a digest sized magazine with comic book elements that he started for the Army in 1951 and continued to work on until the 1970s with Klaus Nordling, Mike Ploog, and other artists. In addition, Eisner produced other military publications such as the graphic manual in 1969, \"http://\", which was distributed along with cleaning kits to address serious reliability concerns with the M16 rifle during the Vietnam War.\nOther clients of his Connecticut-based company included RCA Records, the Baltimore Colts football team, and New York Telephone.\n1970s\u20132005: Godfather of the graphic novel.\nGraphic novels.\nEisner credited the 1971 Comic Art Convention (CAC) for his return to comics. In a 1983 interview with CAC organizer Phil Seuling, he said, \"I came back into the field because of you. I remember you calling me in New London, where I was sitting there as chairman of the board of Croft Publishing Co. My secretary said, 'There's a Mr. Seuling on the phone and he's talking about a comics convention. What is that?' She said, 'I didn't know you were a cartoonist, Mr. Eisner.' 'Oh, yes,' I said, 'secretly; I'm a closet cartoonist.' I came down and was stunned at the existence of the whole world. ... That was a world that I had left, and I found it very exciting, very stimulating\".\nEisner later elaborated about meeting underground comics creators and publishers, including Denis Kitchen:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I went down to the convention, which was being held in one of the hotels in New York, and there was a group of guys with long hair and scraggly beards, who had been turning out what spun as literature, really popular 'gutter' literature if you will, but pure literature. And they were taking on illegal [sic] subject matter that no comics had ever dealt with before. ... I came away from that recognizing that a revolution had occurred then, a turning point in the history of this medium. ... I reasoned that the 13-year-old kids that I'd been writing to back in the 1940s were no longer 13-year-old kids, they were now 30, 40 years old. They would want something more than two heroes, two supermen, crashing against each other. I began working on a book that dealt with a subject that I felt had never been tried by comics before, and that was man's relationship with God. That was the book \"A Contract with God\"...\nIn the late 1970s, Eisner turned his attention to longer storytelling forms. \"A Contract with God: and Other Tenement Stories\" (Baronet Books, October 1978) is an early example of an American graphic novel, combining thematically linked short stories into a single square-bound volume. Eisner continued with a string of graphic novels that tell the history of New York's immigrant communities, particularly Jews, including \"The Building\", \"A Life Force\", \"Dropsie Avenue\" and \"To the Heart of the Storm\". He continued producing new books into his seventies and eighties, at an average rate of nearly one a year. Each of these books was done twice\u00a0\u2013 once as a rough version to show editor Dave Schreiner, then as a second, finished version incorporating suggested changes.\nSome of his last work was the retelling in sequential art of novels and myths, including \"Moby-Dick\". In 2002, at the age of 85, he published \"Sundiata\", based on the part-historical, part-mythical stories of a West African king, \"The Lion of Mali\". \"Fagin the Jew\" is an account of the life of Dickens's character Fagin, in which Eisner tries to get past the stereotyped portrait of Fagin in \"Oliver Twist\".\nHis last graphic novel, \"\", an account of the making, and refutation, of the antisemitic hoax \"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\", was completed shortly before his death and published in 2005.\nIn 2008, Will Eisner's \"The Spirit: A Pop-Up Graphic Novel\" was published, with Bruce Foster as paper engineer.\nTeaching.\nIn his later years especially, Eisner was a frequent lecturer about the craft and uses of sequential art. He taught at the School of Visual Arts in New York City, where he published \"Will Eisner's Gallery\", a collection of work by his students and wrote two books based on these lectures, \"Comics and Sequential Art\" and \"Graphic Storytelling and Visual Narrative\", which are widely used by students of cartooning. In 2002, Eisner participated in the Will Eisner Symposium of the 2002 University of Florida Conference on Comics and Graphic Novels. Before his death, Eisner worked on and outlined a third book, \"Expressive Anatomy for Comics and Narrative\", but would die before its completion. Editor Denis Kitchen and Eisner's family would decide that the book was near completion, and had cartoonist Peter Poplaski finish inking Eisner's art for publication in 2008.\nDeath.\nEisner died January 3, 2005, in Lauderdale Lakes, Florida, of complications from a quadruple bypass surgery performed December 22, 2004. DC Comics held a memorial service in Manhattan's Lower East Side, a neighborhood Eisner often visited in his work, at the Angel Orensanz Foundation on Norfolk Street.\nEisner was survived by his wife, Ann Weingarten Eisner, and their son, John. In the introduction to the 2001 reissue of \"A Contract with God\", Eisner revealed that the inspiration for the title story grew out of the 1970 death of his leukemia-stricken teenaged daughter, Alice, next to whom he is buried. Until then, only Eisner's closest friends were aware of his daughter's life and death.\nAwards and honors.\nEisner has been recognized for his work with the National Cartoonists Society Comic Book Award for 1967, 1968, 1969, 1987 and 1988, as well as its Story Comic Book Award in 1979, and its Reuben Award in 1998. In 1975, he was awarded the Inkpot Award and the second Grand Prix de la ville d'Angoul\u00eame.\nHe was inducted into the Academy of Comic Book Arts Hall of Fame in 1971, and the Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1987. The following year, the Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards were established in his honor. In 2015, Eisner was posthumously elected to the Society of Illustrators Hall of Fame.\nComics by Will Eisner are archived in the James Branch Cabell Library of Virginia Commonwealth University. VCU's James Branch Cabell Library has served as the repository for the Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards since 2005. Each year following Comic-Con, nominated and award-winning titles are donated to the library's Special Collections and Archives and made available to researchers and visitors. Approximately 1,000 comic books, graphic novels, archival editions, scholarly titles, and journals are included in the VCU library's expansive Comic Arts Collection.\nOn the 94th anniversary of Eisner's birth, in 2011, Google used an image featuring the Spirit as its logo.\nWith Jack Kirby, Robert Crumb, Harvey Kurtzman, Gary Panter, and Chris Ware, Eisner was among the artists honored in the exhibition \"Masters of American Comics\" at the Jewish Museum in New York City, from September 16, 2006, to January 28, 2007. In honor of Eisner's centennial in 2017, Denis Kitchen and John Lind co-curated the largest retrospective exhibitions of Will Eisner's original artwork, shown simultaneously at The Society of Illustrators in New York City and Le Mus\u00e9e de la Bande Dessin\u00e9e in Angoul\u00eame, France. Both exhibitions were titled \"Will Eisner Centennial Celebration\" and collectively over 400 original pieces were included. A catalogue of the same name was released by Dark Horse Books and nominated for multiple Eisner Awards in 2018.\nOriginal books.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

On Earth, most weather phenomena occur in the lowest layer of the planet's atmosphere, the troposphere, just below the stratosphere. Weather refers to day-to-day temperature, precipitation, and other atmospheric conditions, whereas climate is the term for the averaging of atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time. When used without qualification, \"weather\" is generally understood to mean the weather of Earth.\nWeather is driven by air pressure, temperature, and moisture differences between one place and another. These differences can occur due to the Sun's angle at any particular spot, which varies with latitude. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the largest scale atmospheric circulations: the Hadley cell, the Ferrel cell, the polar cell, and the jet stream. Weather systems in the middle latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet streamflow. Because Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane (called the ecliptic), sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. On Earth's surface, temperatures usually range \u00b140\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221240\u00a0\u00b0F to 104\u00a0\u00b0F) annually. Over thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbit can affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by Earth, thus influencing long-term climate and global climate change.\nSurface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences. Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes, as most atmospheric heating is due to contact with the Earth's surface while radiative losses to space are mostly constant. Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location. Earth's weather system is a chaotic system; as a result, small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole. Human attempts to control the weather have occurred throughout history, and there is evidence that human activities such as agriculture and industry have modified weather patterns.\nStudying how the weather works on other planets has been helpful in understanding how weather works on Earth. A famous landmark in the Solar System, Jupiter's Great Red Spot, is an anticyclonic storm known to have existed for at least 300 years. However, the weather is not limited to planetary bodies. A star's corona is constantly being lost to space, creating what is essentially a very thin atmosphere throughout the Solar System. The movement of mass ejected from the Sun is known as the solar wind.\nCauses.\nOn Earth, common weather phenomena include wind, cloud, rain, snow, fog and dust storms. Some more common events include natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes, typhoons and ice storms. Almost all familiar weather phenomena occur in the troposphere (the lower part of the atmosphere). Weather does occur in the stratosphere and can affect weather lower down in the troposphere, but the exact mechanisms are poorly understood.\nWeather occurs primarily due to air pressure, temperature and moisture differences from one place to another. These differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude in the tropics. In other words, the farther from the tropics one lies, the lower the sun angle is, which causes those locations to be cooler due to the spread of the sunlight over a greater surface. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the large scale atmospheric circulation cells and the jet stream. Weather systems in the mid-latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow (see baroclinity). Weather systems in the tropics, such as monsoons or organized thunderstorm systems, are caused by different processes.\nBecause the Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. In June the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun, so at any given Northern Hemisphere latitude sunlight falls more directly on that spot than in December (see Effect of sun angle on climate). This effect causes seasons. Over thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbital parameters affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long-term climate. (See Milankovitch cycles).\nThe uneven solar heating (the formation of zones of temperature and moisture gradients, or frontogenesis) can also be due to the weather itself in the form of cloudiness and precipitation. Higher altitudes are typically cooler than lower altitudes, which is the result of higher surface temperature and radiational heating, which produces the adiabatic lapse rate. In some situations, the temperature actually increases with height. This phenomenon is known as an inversion and can cause mountaintops to be warmer than the valleys below. Inversions can lead to the formation of fog and often act as a cap that suppresses thunderstorm development. On local scales, temperature differences can occur because different surfaces (such as oceans, forests, ice sheets, or human-made objects) have differing physical characteristics such as reflectivity, roughness, or moisture content.\nSurface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences. A hot surface warms the air above it causing it to expand and lower the density and the resulting surface air pressure. The resulting horizontal pressure gradient moves the air from higher to lower pressure regions, creating a wind, and the Earth's rotation then causes deflection of this airflow due to the Coriolis effect. The simple systems thus formed can then display emergent behaviour to produce more complex systems and thus other weather phenomena. Large scale examples include the Hadley cell while a smaller scale example would be coastal breezes.\nThe atmosphere is a chaotic system. As a result, small changes to one part of the system can accumulate and magnify to cause large effects on the system as a whole. This atmospheric instability makes weather forecasting less predictable than tidal waves or eclipses. Although it is difficult to accurately predict weather more than a few days in advance, weather forecasters are continually working to extend this limit through meteorological research and refining current methodologies in weather prediction. However, it is theoretically impossible to make useful day-to-day predictions more than about two weeks ahead, imposing an upper limit to potential for improved prediction skill.\nShaping the planet Earth.\nWeather is one of the fundamental processes that shape the Earth. The process of weathering breaks down the rocks and soils into smaller fragments and then into their constituent substances. During rains precipitation, the water droplets absorb and dissolve carbon dioxide from the surrounding air. This causes the rainwater to be slightly acidic, which aids the erosive properties of water. The released sediment and chemicals are then free to take part in chemical reactions that can affect the surface further (such as acid rain), and sodium and chloride ions (salt) deposited in the seas/oceans. The sediment may reform in time and by geological forces into other rocks and soils. In this way, weather plays a major role in erosion of the surface.\nEffect on humans.\nWeather, seen from an anthropological perspective, is something all humans in the world constantly experience through their senses, at least while being outside. There are socially and scientifically constructed understandings of what weather is, what makes it change, the effect the weather, and especially inclement weather, has on humans in different situations, etc. Therefore, weather is something people often communicate about.\nIn the United States, the National Weather Service has an annual report for fatalities, injury, and total damage costs which include crop and property. They gather this data via National Weather Service offices located throughout the 50 states in the United States as well as it's territories. As of 2019, tornadoes have had the greatest impact on humans with 42 fatalities while costing crop and property damage over 3 billion dollars.\nEffects on populations.\nThe weather has played a large and sometimes direct part in human history. Aside from climatic changes that have caused the gradual drift of populations (for example the desertification of the Middle East, and the formation of land bridges during glacial periods), extreme weather events have caused smaller scale population movements and intruded directly in historical events. One such event is the saving of Japan from invasion by the Mongol fleet of Kublai Khan by the Kamikaze winds in 1281. French claims to Florida came to an end in 1565 when a hurricane destroyed the French fleet, allowing Spain to conquer Fort Caroline. More recently, Hurricane Katrina redistributed over one million people from the central Gulf coast elsewhere across the United States, becoming the largest diaspora in the history of the United States.\nThe Little Ice Age caused crop failures and famines in Europe. During the period known as the Grindelwald Fluctuation (1560\u20131630), volcanic forcing events seem to have led to more extreme weather events. These included droughts, storms and unseasonal blizzards, as well as causing the Swiss Grindelwald Glacier to expand. The 1690s saw the worst famine in France since the Middle Ages. Finland suffered a severe famine in 1696\u20131697, during which about one-third of the Finnish population died.\nForecasting.\nWeather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location. Human beings have attempted to predict the weather informally for millennia, and formally since at least the nineteenth century. Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere and using scientific understanding of atmospheric processes to project how the atmosphere will evolve.\nOnce an all-human endeavor based mainly upon changes in barometric pressure, current weather conditions, and sky condition, forecast models are now used to determine future conditions. On the other hand, human input is still required to pick the best possible forecast model to base the forecast upon, which involves many disciplines such as pattern recognition skills, teleconnections, knowledge of model performance, and knowledge of model biases.\nThe chaotic nature of the atmosphere, the massive computational power required to solve the equations that describe the atmosphere, the error involved in measuring the initial conditions, and an incomplete understanding of atmospheric processes mean that forecasts become less accurate as of the difference in current time and the time for which the forecast is being made (the \"range\" of the forecast) increases. The use of ensembles and model consensus helps to narrow the error and pick the most likely outcome.\nThere are a variety of end users to weather forecasts. Weather warnings are important forecasts because they are used to protect life and property. Forecasts based on temperature and precipitation are important to agriculture, and therefore to commodity traders within stock markets. Temperature forecasts are used by utility companies to estimate demand over coming days.\nIn some areas, people use weather forecasts to determine what to wear on a given day. Since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain, snow and the wind chill, forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events and to plan ahead to survive through them.\nTropical weather forecasting is different from that at higher latitudes. The sun shines more directly on the tropics than on higher latitudes (at least on average over a year), which makes the tropics warm (Stevens 2011). And, the vertical direction (up, as one stands on the Earth's surface) is perpendicular to the Earth's axis of rotation at the equator, while the axis of rotation and the vertical are the same at the pole; this causes the Earth's rotation to influence the atmospheric circulation more strongly at high latitudes than low latitudes. Because of these two factors, clouds and rainstorms in the tropics can occur more spontaneously compared to those at higher latitudes, where they are more tightly controlled by larger-scale forces in the atmosphere. Because of these differences, clouds and rain are more difficult to forecast in the tropics than at higher latitudes. On the other hand, the temperature is easily forecast in the tropics, because it does not change much.\nModification.\nThe aspiration to control the weather is evident throughout human history: from ancient rituals intended to bring rain for crops to the U.S. Military Operation Popeye, an attempt to disrupt supply lines by lengthening the North Vietnamese monsoon. The most successful attempts at influencing weather involve cloud seeding; they include the fog- and low stratus dispersion techniques employed by major airports, techniques used to increase winter precipitation over mountains, and techniques to suppress hail. A recent example of weather control was China's preparation for the 2008 Summer Olympic Games. China shot 1,104 rain dispersal rockets from 21 sites in the city of Beijing in an effort to keep rain away from the opening ceremony of the games on 8 August 2008. Guo Hu, head of the Beijing Municipal Meteorological Bureau (BMB), confirmed the success of the operation with 100 millimeters falling in Baoding City of Hebei Province, to the southwest and Beijing's Fangshan District recording a rainfall of 25 millimeters.\nWhereas there is inconclusive evidence for these techniques' efficacy, there is extensive evidence that human activity such as agriculture and industry results in inadvertent weather modification:\nThe effects of inadvertent weather modification may pose serious threats to many aspects of civilization, including ecosystems, natural resources, food and fiber production, economic development, and human health.\nMicroscale meteorology.\nMicroscale meteorology is the study of short-lived atmospheric phenomena smaller than mesoscale, about 1\u00a0km or less. These two branches of meteorology are sometimes grouped together as \"mesoscale and microscale meteorology\" (MMM) and together study all phenomena smaller than synoptic scale; that is they study features generally too small to be depicted on a weather map. These include small and generally fleeting cloud \"puffs\" and other small cloud features.\nExtremes on Earth.\nOn Earth, temperatures usually range \u00b140\u00a0\u00b0C (100\u00a0\u00b0F to \u221240\u00a0\u00b0F) annually. The range of climates and latitudes across the planet can offer extremes of temperature outside this range. The coldest air temperature ever recorded on Earth is , at Vostok Station, Antarctica on 21 July 1983. The hottest air temperature ever recorded was at \u02bdAziziya, Libya, on 13 September 1922, but that reading was deemed illegitimate by the World Meteorological Organization. The highest recorded average annual temperature was at Dallol, Ethiopia. The coldest recorded average annual temperature was at Vostok Station, Antarctica.\nThe coldest average annual temperature in a permanently inhabited location is at Eureka, Nunavut, in Canada, where the annual average temperature is .\nThe windiest place ever recorded is in Antarctica, Commonwealth Bay (George V Coast). Here the gales reach . Furthermore, the greatest snowfall in a period of twelve months occurred in Mount Rainier, Washington, US. It was recorded as of snow.\nExtraterrestrial weather.\nStudying how the weather works on other planets has been seen as helpful in understanding how it works on Earth. Weather on other planets follows many of the same physical principles as weather on Earth, but occurs on different scales and in atmospheres having different chemical composition. The \"Cassini\u2013Huygens\" mission to Titan discovered clouds formed from methane or ethane which deposit rain composed of liquid methane and other organic compounds. Earth's atmosphere includes six latitudinal circulation zones, three in each hemisphere. In contrast, Jupiter's banded appearance shows many such zones, Titan has a single jet stream near the 50th parallel north latitude, and Venus has a single jet near the equator.\nOne of the most famous landmarks in the Solar System, Jupiter's Great Red Spot, is an anticyclonic storm known to have existed for at least 300 years. On other giant planets, the lack of a surface allows the wind to reach enormous speeds: gusts of up to 600\u00a0metres per second (about ) have been measured on the planet Neptune. This has created a puzzle for planetary scientists. The weather is ultimately created by solar energy and the amount of energy received by Neptune is only about &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u2044900 of that received by Earth, yet the intensity of weather phenomena on Neptune is far greater than on Earth. As of 2007[ [update]], the strongest planetary winds discovered are on the extrasolar planet HD 189733 b, which is thought to have easterly winds moving at more than .\nSpace weather.\nWeather is not limited to planetary bodies. Like all stars, the Sun's corona is constantly being lost to space, creating what is essentially a very thin atmosphere throughout the Solar System. The movement of mass ejected from the Sun is known as the solar wind. Inconsistencies in this wind and larger events on the surface of the star, such as coronal mass ejections, form a system that has features analogous to conventional weather systems (such as pressure and wind) and is generally known as space weather. Coronal mass ejections have been tracked as far out in the Solar System as Saturn. The activity of this system can affect planetary atmospheres and occasionally surfaces. The interaction of the solar wind with the terrestrial atmosphere can produce spectacular aurorae, and can play havoc with electrically sensitive systems such as electricity grids and radio signals.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Each phase is completed before the next is started, and the result of each phase drives subsequent phases. Compared to alternative SDLC methodologies such as Agile, it is among the least iterative and flexible, as progress flows largely in one direction (like a waterfall) through the phases of conception, requirements analysis, design, construction, testing, deployment, and maintenance.\nThe waterfall model is the earliest SDLC methodology.\nWhen first adopted, there were no recognized alternatives for knowledge-based creative work.\nHistory.\nThe first known presentation describing the use of such phases in software engineering was held by Herbert D. Benington at the Symposium on Advanced Programming Methods for Digital Computers on 29 June 1956.\nThis presentation was about the development of software for SAGE. In 1983, Benington republished his paper with a foreword explaining that the phases were on purpose organized according to the specialization of tasks, and pointing out that the process was not in fact performed in a strict top-down fashion, but depended on a prototype.\nAlthough the term \"waterfall\" is not used in the paper, the first formal, detailed diagram of the process is often cited as coming from a 1970 article by Winston W. Royce. However, he commented that it had major flaws stemming from how testing only happened at the end of the process, which he described as being \"risky and [inviting] failure\". The rest of his paper introduced five steps which he felt were necessary to \"eliminate most of the development risks\" associated with the unaltered waterfall approach. Royce's five additional steps (which included writing complete documentation at various stages of development) never took mainstream hold, but his diagram of what he considered a flawed process became the starting point when describing a \"waterfall\" approach.\nThe earliest use of the term \"waterfall\" may have been in a 1976 paper by Bell and Thayer.\nIn 1985, the United States Department of Defense adopted the waterfall model in the DOD-STD-2167 standard for working with software development contractors. This standard referred for iterations of a software development to \"\"the sequential phases of a software development cycle\" and stated that \"the contractor shall implement a software development cycle that includes the following six phases: Software Requirement Analysis, Preliminary Design, Detailed Design, Coding and Unit Testing, Integration, and Testing\"\".\nPhases.\nThe model describes a linear sequence of steps. Although various different versions can be found, the following describes the essence.\nPreliminary analysis.\nConduct with a preliminary analysis, consider alternative solutions, estimate costs and benefits, and submit a preliminary plan with recommendations.\n* Conduct preliminary analysis: Identify the organization's objectives and define the nature and scope of the project. Ensure that the project fits with the objectives.\n* Consider alternative solutions: Alternatives may come from interviewing employees, clients, suppliers, and consultants, as well as competitive analysis.\n* Cost-benefit analysis: Analyze the costs and benefits of the project.\nSystems analysis, requirements definition.\nDecompose project goals into defined functions and operations. This involves gathering and interpreting facts, diagnosing problems, and recommending changes. Analyze end-user information needs and resolve inconsistencies and incompleteness:\n* Collect facts: Obtain end-user requirements by document review, client interviews, observation, and questionnaires.\n* Scrutinize existing system(s): Identify pros and cons.\n* Analyze the proposed system: Find solutions to issues and prepare specifications, incorporating appropriate user proposals.\nSystems design.\nAt this step, desired features and operations are detailed, including screen layouts, business rules, process diagrams, pseudocode, and other deliverables.\nDevelopment.\nWrite the code.\nIntegration and testing.\nAssemble the modules in a testing environment. Check for errors, bugs, and interoperability.\nAcceptance, installation, deployment.\nPut the system into production. This may involve training users, deploying hardware, and loading information from the prior system.\nMaintenance.\nMonitor the system to assess its ongoing fitness. Make modest changes and fixes as needed. To maintain the quality of the system. Continual monitoring and updates ensure the system remains effective and high-quality.\nEvaluation.\nThe system and the process are reviewed. Relevant questions include whether the newly implemented system meets requirements and achieves project goals, whether the system is usable, reliable/available, properly scaled and fault-tolerant. Process checks include review of timelines and expenses, as well as user acceptance.\nDisposal.\nAt end of life, plans are developed for discontinuing the system and transitioning to its replacement. Related information and infrastructure must be repurposed, archived, discarded, or destroyed, while appropriately protecting security.\nSupporting arguments.\nTime spent early in the software production cycle can reduce costs at later stages. For example, a problem found in the early stages (such as requirements specification) is cheaper to fix than the same bug found later on in the process (by a factor of 50 to 200).\nIn common practice, waterfall methodologies result in a project schedule with 20\u201340% of the time invested for the first two phases, 30\u201340% of the time to coding, and the rest dedicated to testing and implementation. With the project organization needing to be highly structured, most medium and large projects will include a detailed set of procedures and controls, which regulate every process on the project.\nA further argument supporting the waterfall model is that it places emphasis on documentation (such as requirements documents and design documents) as well as source code. In less thoroughly designed and documented methodologies, knowledge is lost if team members leave before the project is completed, and it may be difficult for a project to recover from the loss. If a fully working design document is present (as is the intent of big design up front and the waterfall model), new team members and new teams should be able to familiarise themselves to the project by reading the documents.\nThe waterfall model provides a structured approach; the model itself progresses linearly through discrete, easily understandable and explainable phases and thus is easy to understand. It also provides easily identifiable milestones in the development process, often being used as a beginning example of a development model in many software engineering texts and courses.\nSimilarly, simulation can play a valuable role within the waterfall model. By creating computerized or mathematical simulations of the system being developed, teams can gain insights into how the system will perform before proceeding to the next phase. Simulations allow for testing and refining the design, identifying potential issues or bottlenecks, and making informed decisions about the system's functionality and performance.\nCriticism.\nClients may not know the exact requirements before they see working software and thus change their requirements further on, leading to redesign, redevelopment, and retesting, and increased costs.\nDesigners may not be aware of future difficulties when designing a new software product or feature, in which case revising the design initially can increase efficiency in comparison to a design not built to account for newly discovered constraints, requirements, or problems.\nOrganisations may attempt to deal with a lack of concrete requirements from clients by employing systems analysts to examine existing manual systems and analyse what they do and how they might be replaced. However, in practice, it is difficult to sustain a strict separation between systems analysis and programming, as implementing any non-trivial system will often expose issues and edge cases that the systems analyst did not consider.\nSome organisations, such as the United States Department of Defense, now have a stated preference against waterfall-type methodologies, starting with MIL-STD-498 released in 1994, which encourages \"evolutionary acquisition\" and \"iterative and incremental development\".\nModified waterfall models.\nIn response to perceived problems with the original, pure waterfall model, many modified versions have been devised to address the problems. These include the rapid development models that Steve McConnell calls \"modified waterfalls\": Peter DeGrace's \"sashimi model\" (waterfall with overlapping phases), waterfall with subprojects, and waterfall with risk reduction. Other software development model combinations such as \"incremental waterfall model\" also exist.\nRoyce's final model illustrated that feedback could (should, and often would) lead from code testing to design (as testing of code uncovered flaws in the design) and from design back to requirements specification (as design problems may necessitate the removal of conflicting or otherwise unsatisfiable/undesignable requirements). In the same paper Royce also advocated large quantities of documentation, doing the job \"twice if possible\" (a sentiment similar to that of Fred Brooks, famous for writing the Mythical Man Month \u2014 an influential book in software project management \u2014 who advocated planning to \"throw one away\"), and involving the customer as much as possible (a sentiment similar to that of extreme programming).\nRoyce notes on the final model are:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 1981, Holland co-founded the Chaos Computer Club (CCC).\nFrom 1983 he was a columnist for the Berlin-based \"Die Tageszeitung\", often reporting on the BBS scene and the computer underground. In the same year, he also supervised the phototypesetting of one of the early books created entirely on a computer (Osborne 1). \nHolland also co-founded the CCC's hacker magazine \"Datenschleuder\" in 1984, which praised the possibilities of global information networks and powerful computers, and included detailed wiring diagrams for building modems cheaply. The then-monopolist telephone company of Germany's Deutsche Bundespost had to approve modems and sold expensive, slow modems of their own. \"Connecting a do-it-yourself modem was punished more severely than negligent triggering of a nuclear explosion\", Wau Holland famously said about this situation. The telecommunications branch of Deutsche Bundespost was privatized and is now Deutsche Telekom.\nBecause of Holland's continuing participation in the club, the CCC gained popularity and credibility. He gave speeches on information control for the government and the private sector. Holland fought against copy protection and all forms of censorship and for an open information infrastructure. He compared the censorship demands by some governments to those of the Christian church in the Middle Ages and regarded copy protection as a product defect. In his last years, he spent a lot of his time at a youth centre teaching children both the ethics and the technology of hacking.\nPersonal life.\nHolland was born in Kassel, and grew up in Marburg, Hesse. He graduated from the Gymnasium Philippinum secondary school and attended the University of Marburg, though he did not graduate. \nHolland was an amateur radio operator and held the call sign DB4FA.\nAfter the Peaceful Revolution, Holland lived in Ilmenau and taught ethics in computer science with Gabriele Schade at the Technical University of Ilmenau (therefore calling himself ironically honorary professor). He was close friends with Bernd Fix and Wolfgang Rudolph. He became an advocate for encrypted messaging.\nHolland died in Bielefeld on 29 July 2001 of complications caused by a brain stem stroke from which he suffered in May.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Originally known as the Weathermen, or simply Weatherman, the group was organized as a faction of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) national leadership. Officially known as the Weather Underground Organization (WUO) beginning in 1970, the group's express political goal was to create a revolutionary party to overthrow the United States government, which WUO believed to be imperialist.\nThe FBI described the WUO as a domestic terrorist group, with revolutionary positions characterized by Black Power and opposition to the Vietnam War. The WUO took part in domestic attacks such as the jailbreak of Timothy Leary in 1970. The \"Days of Rage\" was the WUO's first riot in October 1969 in Chicago, timed to coincide with the trial of the Chicago Seven. In 1970, the group issued a \"Declaration of a State of War\" against the United States government under the name \"Weather Underground Organization\".\nIn the 1970s, the WUO conducted a bombing campaign targeting government buildings and several banks. Some attacks were preceded by evacuation warnings, along with threats identifying the particular matter that the attack was intended to protest. Three members of the group were killed in an accidental Greenwich Village townhouse explosion, but none were killed in any of the bombings. The WUO communiqu\u00e9 issued in connection with the bombing of the United States Capitol on March 1, 1971, indicated that it was \"in protest of the U.S. invasion of Laos\". The WUO asserted that its May 19, 1972, bombing of the Pentagon was \"in retaliation for the U.S. bombing raid in Hanoi\". On September 28, 1973, an ITT Inc building in New York City was bombed for the involvement of this company in the 1973 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tat. The WUO announced that its January 29, 1975 bombing of the United States Department of State building was \"in response to the escalation in Vietnam\".\nThe WUO began to disintegrate after the United States reached a peace accord in Vietnam in 1973, and it was defunct by 1977. Some members of the WUO joined the May 19th Communist Organization and continued their activities until that group disbanded in 1985.\nThe group took its name from Bob Dylan's lyric \"You don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows\", from the song \"Subterranean Homesick Blues\" (1965). That Dylan line was also the title of a position paper distributed at an SDS convention in Chicago on June 18, 1969. This founding document called for a \"White fighting force\" to be allied with the \"Black Liberation Movement\" and other radical movements to achieve \"the destruction of U.S. imperialism and form a classless communist world\".\nBackground and formation.\nThe Weathermen emerged from the campus-based opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War as well as from the civil rights movement of the 1960s. One of the factors that contributed to the radicalization of SDS members was the Economic Research and Action Project that the SDS undertook in Northern urban neighborhoods from 1963 to 1968. This project was aimed at creating an interracial movement of the poor that would mobilize for full and fair employment or guaranteed annual income and political rights for poverty class Americans. Their goal was to create a more democratic society \"which guarantees political freedom, economic and physical security, abundant education, and incentives for wide cultural variety\". While the initial phase of the SDS involved campus organizing, phase two involved community organizing. These experiences led some SDS members to conclude that deep social change would not happen through community organizing and electoral politics, and that more radical and disruptive tactics were needed.\nIn the late 1960s, United States military action in Southeast Asia escalated, especially in Vietnam. In the U.S., the anti-war sentiment was particularly pronounced during the 1968 U.S. presidential election.\nThe origins of the Weathermen can be traced to the collapse and fragmentation of the Students for a Democratic Society following a split between office holders of the SDS, or the \"National Office\", and their supporters and the Progressive Labor Party (PLP). During the factional struggle, National Office leaders such as Bernardine Dohrn and Mike Klonsky began announcing their emerging perspectives, and Klonsky published a document titled \"Toward a Revolutionary Youth Movement\" (RYM).\nRYM promoted the philosophy that young workers possessed the potential to be a revolutionary force which could overthrow capitalism, if not by themselves then by transmitting radical ideas to the working class. Klonsky's document reflected the philosophy of the National Office and it was eventually adopted as the SDS's official doctrine. During the summer of 1969, the National Office began to split. A group led by Klonsky became known as RYM II, and the other side, RYM I, was led by Dohrn and endorsed more aggressive tactics such as direct action, as some members felt that years of nonviolent resistance had done little or nothing to stop the Vietnam War. The Weathermen strongly sympathized with the radical Black Panther Party. The police killing of Panther Fred Hampton prompted the Weatherman to issue a declaration of war upon the United States government.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We petitioned, we demonstrated, we sat in. I was willing to get hit over the head, I did; I was willing to go to prison, I did. To me, it was a question of what had to be done to stop the much greater violence that was going on.\nSDS Convention, June 1969.\nAt an SDS convention in Chicago on June 18, 1969, the National Office attempted to persuade unaffiliated delegates not to endorse a takeover of SDS by Progressive Labor who had packed the convention with their supporters. It was at the 1966 convention of SDS that members of PLP began to make their presence known for the first time. The PLP was a Stalinist group that had turned to SDS as fertile ground for recruiting new members after meeting with little success in organizing industrial workers, their preferred base. SDS members of that time were nearly all anti-communist, but they also refused to be drawn into actions that appeared like red-baiting, which they viewed as mostly irrelevant and out of date. The PLP soon began to organize a Worker Student Alliance. By 1968 and 1969 they would profoundly affect SDS, particularly at national gatherings of the membership, forming a well-groomed, disciplined faction which followed the Progressive Labor Party line. At the beginning of the convention, two position papers were passed out by the National Office leadership, one a revised statement of Klonsky's RYM manifesto, the other called \"You Don't Need a Weatherman to Know Which Way the Wind Blows\".\nThe latter document outlined the position of the group that would become the Weathermen. It had been signed by Karen Ashley, Bill Ayers, Bernardine Dohrn, John Jacobs, Jeff Jones, Gerry Long, Howie Machtinger, Jim Mellen, Terry Robbins, Mark Rudd, and Steve Tappis. The document called for creating a clandestine revolutionary party.\nThe most important task for us toward making the revolution, and the work our collectives should engage in, is the creation of a mass revolutionary movement, without which a clandestine revolutionary party will be impossible. A revolutionary mass movement is different from the traditional revisionist mass base of \"sympathizers\". Rather it is akin to the Red Guard in China, based on the full participation and involvement of masses of people in the practice of making revolution; a movement with a full willingness to participate in the violent and illegal struggle.\nAt this convention the Weatherman's faction of the Students for a Democratic Society, planned for October 8\u201311, as a \"National Action\" built around John Jacobs' slogan, \"bring the war home\". The National Action grew out of a resolution drafted by Jacobs and introduced at the October 1968 SDS National Council meeting in Boulder, Colorado. The resolution, titled \"The Elections Don't Mean Shit\u2014Vote Where the Power Is\u2014Our Power Is In The Street\" and adopted by the council, was prompted by the success of the Democratic National Convention protests in August 1968 and reflected Jacobs' strong advocacy of direct action.\nAs part of the \"National Action Staff\", Jacobs was an integral part of the planning for what quickly came to be called \"Four Days of Rage\". For Jacobs, the goal of the \"Days of Rage\" was clear:\nWeatherman would shove the war down their dumb, fascist throats and show them, while we were at it, how much better we were than them, both tactically and strategically, as a people. In an all-out civil war over Vietnam and other fascist U.S. imperialism, we were going to bring the war home. 'Turn the imperialists' war into a civil war', in Lenin's words. And we were going to kick ass.\nIn July 1969, 30 members of Weatherman leadership traveled to Cuba and met with North Vietnamese representatives to gain from their revolutionary experience. The North Vietnamese requested armed political action in order to stop the U.S. government's war in Vietnam. Subsequently, they accepted funding, training, recommendations on tactics and slogans from Cuba, and perhaps explosives as well.\nSDS Convention, December 1969.\nAfter the Days of Rage riots the Weatherman held the last of its National Council meetings from December 26 to December 31, 1969, in Flint, Michigan. The meeting, dubbed the \"War Council\" by the 300 people who attended, adopted Jacobs' call for violent revolution. Dohrn opened the conference by telling the delegates they needed to stop being afraid and begin the \"armed struggle\". Over the next five days, the participants met in informal groups to discuss what \"going underground\" meant, how best to organize collectives, and justifications for violence. In the evening, the groups reconvened for a mass \"wargasm\"\u2014practicing karate, engaging in physical exercise, singing songs, and listening to speeches.\nThe War Council ended with a major speech by John Jacobs. Jacobs condemned the \"pacifism\" of white middle-class American youth, a belief which he claimed they held because they were insulated from the violence which afflicted blacks and the poor. He predicted a successful revolution, and declared that youth were moving away from passivity and apathy and toward a new high-energy culture of \"depersonalization\" brought about by drugs, sex, and armed revolution. \"We're against everything that's 'good and decent' in honky America,\" Jacobs said in his most commonly quoted statement. \"We will burn and loot and destroy. We are the incubation of your mother's nightmare.\"\nTwo major decisions came out of the War Council. The first was to go underground and to begin a violent, armed struggle against the state without attempting to organize or mobilize a broad swath of the public. The Weather Underground hoped to create underground collectives in major cities throughout the country. In fact, the Weathermen eventually created only three significant, active collectives; one in California, one in the Midwest, and one in New York City. The New York City collective was led by Jacobs and Terry Robbins, and included Ted Gold, Kathy Boudin, Cathy Wilkerson (Robbins's girlfriend), and Diana Oughton. Jacobs was one of Robbins's biggest supporters, and pushed the Weathermen to let Robbins be as violent as he wanted to be. The Weatherman national leadership agreed, as did the New York City collective. The collective's first target was Judge John Murtagh, who was overseeing the trial of the \"Panther 21\".\nThe second major decision was the dissolution of SDS. After the summer of 1969 fragmentation of SDS, Weatherman's adherents explicitly claimed themselves the \"real leaders\" of SDS and retained control of the SDS National Office. Thereafter, any leaflet, label, or logo bearing the name \"Students for a Democratic Society\" (SDS) was in fact the views and politics of Weatherman, not of the slate elected by Progressive Labor. Weatherman contained the vast majority of former SDS National Committee members, including Mark Rudd, David Gilbert, Vernon T. Grizzard and Bernardine Dohrn. The group, while small, was able to commandeer the mantle of SDS and all of its membership lists, but with Weatherman in charge there was little or no support from local branches or members of the organization, and local chapters soon disbanded. At the War Council, the Weathermen had decided to close the SDS National Office, ending the major campus-based organization of the 1960s which at its peak was a mass organization with 100,000 members.\nIdeology.\nThe thesis of Weatherman theory, as expounded in its founding document, \"You Don't Need a Weatherman to Know Which Way the Wind Blows\", was that \"the main struggle going on in the world today is between U.S. imperialism and the national liberation struggles against it\", based on Lenin's theory of imperialism, first expounded in 1916 in \"Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism\". In Weatherman theory \"oppressed peoples\" are the creators of the wealth of empire, \"and it is to them that it belongs.\" \"The goal of revolutionary struggle must be the control and use of this wealth in the interest of the oppressed peoples of the world.\" \"The goal is the destruction of U.S. imperialism and the achievement of a classless world: world communism\"\nThe Vietnamese and other third world countries, as well as third world people within the United States play a vanguard role. They \"set the terms for class struggle in America\u00a0...\". The role of the \"Revolutionary Youth Movement\" is to build a centralized organization of revolutionaries, a \"Marxist\u2013Leninist Party\" supported by a mass revolutionary movement to support international liberation movements and \"open another battlefield of the revolution.\"\nThe theoretical basis of the Revolutionary Youth Movement was an insight that most of the American population, including both students and the supposed \"middle class\", comprised, due to their relationship to the instruments of production, the working class, thus the organizational basis of the SDS, which had begun in the elite colleges and had been extended to public institutions as the organization grew could be extended to youth as a whole including students, those serving in the military, and the unemployed. Students could be viewed as workers gaining skills prior to employment. This contrasted to the Progressive Labor view which viewed students and workers as being in separate categories which could ally, but should not jointly organize.\nFBI analysis of the travel history of the founders and initial followers of the organization emphasized contacts with foreign governments, particularly the Cuban and North Vietnamese and their influence on the ideology of the organization. Participation in the Venceremos Brigade, a program which involved U.S. students volunteering to work in the sugar harvest in Cuba, is highlighted as a common factor in the background of the founders of the Weather Underground, with China a secondary influence. This experience was cited by both Kathy Boudin and Bernardine Dohrn as a major influence on their political development.\nTerry Robbins took the organization's name from the lyrics of the Bob Dylan song \"Subterranean Homesick Blues\", which featured the lyrics \"You don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.\" The lyrics had been quoted at the bottom of an influential essay in the SDS newspaper, \"New Left Notes\". By using this title the Weathermen meant, partially, to appeal to the segment of U.S. youth inspired to action for social justice by Dylan's songs.\nThe Weatherman group had long held that militancy was becoming more important than nonviolent forms of anti-war action, and that university campus-based demonstrations needed to be punctuated with more dramatic actions, which had the potential to interfere with the U.S. military and internal security apparatus. The belief was that these types of urban guerrilla actions would act as a catalyst for the coming revolution. Many international events indeed seemed to support the Weathermen's overall assertion that worldwide revolution was imminent, such as the tumultuous Cultural Revolution in China; the 1968 student revolts in France, Mexico City and elsewhere; the Prague Spring; the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association; the emergence of the Tupamaros organization in Uruguay; the emergence of the Guinea-Bissauan Revolution and similar Marxist-led independence movements throughout Africa; and within the United States, the prominence of the Black Panther Party, together with a series of \"ghetto rebellions\" throughout poor black neighborhoods across the country.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We felt that doing nothing in a period of repressive violence is itself a form of violence. That's really the part that I think is the hardest for people to understand. If you sit in your house, live your white life and go to your white job, and allow the country that you live in to murder people and to commit genocide, and you sit there and you don't do anything about it, that's violence.\nThe Weathermen were outspoken critics of the concepts that later came to be known as \"white privilege\" (described as white-skin privilege) and identity politics. As the civil disorder in poor black neighborhoods intensified in the early 1970s, Bernardine Dohrn said, \"White youth must choose sides \"now.\" They must either fight on the side of the oppressed or be on the side of the oppressor.\"\nThe Weathermen called for the overthrow of the United States government.\nAnti-imperialism, anti-racism, and white privilege.\nWeather maintained that their stance differed from the rest of the movements at the time in the sense that they predicated their critiques on the notion that they were engaged in \"an anti-imperialist, anti-racist struggle\". Weather put the \"international\" proletariat at the center of their political theory. Weather warned that other political theories, including those addressing class interests or youth interests, were \"bound to lead in a racist and chauvinist direction\". Weather denounced other political theories of the time as \"objectively racist\" if they did not side with the international proletariat; such political theories, they argued, needed to be \"smashed\".\nMembers of Weather further contended that efforts at \"organizing whites against their own perceived oppression\" were \"attempts by whites to carve out even more privilege than they already derive from the imperialist nexus\". Weather's political theory sought to make every struggle an anti-imperialist, anti-racist struggle; out of this premise came their interrogation of critical concepts that would later be known as \"white privilege\". As historian Dan Berger writes, Weather raised the question \"what does it mean to be a white person opposing racism and imperialism?\"\nAt one point, the Weathermen adopted the belief that all white babies were \"tainted with the original sin of \"skin privilege\", declaring \"all white babies are pigs\" with one Weatherwoman telling feminist poet Robin Morgan \"You have no right to that pig male baby\" after she saw Morgan breastfeeding her son and told Morgan to put the baby in the garbage. Charles Manson was an obsession within the group and Dohrn claimed he truly understood the iniquity of white America, with the Manson family being praised for the murder of Sharon Tate; Dohrn's cell subsequently made its salute a four-fingered gesture that represented the \"fork\" used to stab Tate.\nPractice.\nShortly after its formation as an independent group, Weatherman created a central committee, the Weather Bureau, which assigned its cadres to a series of collectives in major cities. These cities included New York, Boston, Seattle, Philadelphia, Cincinnati, Buffalo, and Chicago, the home of the SDS's head office. The collectives set up under the Weather Bureau drew their design from Che Guevara's \"foco\" theory, which focused on the building of small, semi-autonomous cells guided by a central leadership.\nTo try to turn their members into hardened revolutionaries and to promote solidarity and cohesion, members of collectives engaged in intensive criticism sessions which attempted to reconcile their prior and current activities to Weathermen doctrine. These \"criticism self-criticism\" sessions (also called \"CSC\" or \"Weatherfries\") were the most distressing part of life in the collective. Derived from Maoist techniques, it was intended to root out racist, individualist and chauvinist tendencies within group members. At its most intense, members would be berated for a dozen or more hours non-stop about their flaws. It was intended to make group members believe that they were, deep down, white supremacists by subjecting them to constant criticism to break them down. The sessions were used to ridicule and bully those who didn't agree with the party line and force them into acceptance. However, the sessions were also almost entirely successful at purging potential informants from the Weathermen's ranks, making them crucial to the Weathermen's survival as an underground organization. The Weathermen were also determined to destroy \"bourgeois individualism\" amongst members that would potentially interfere with their commitment to both the Weathermen and the goal of revolution. Personal property was either renounced or given to the collective, with income being used to purchase the needs of the group and members enduring spartan living conditions. Conventional comforts were forbidden, and the leadership was exalted, giving them immense power over their subordinates (in some collectives the leadership could even dictate personal decisions such as where one went). Martial arts were practiced and occasional direct actions were engaged in. Critical of monogamy, they launched a \"smash monogamy\" campaign, in which couples (whose affection was deemed unacceptably possessive, counterrevolutionary or even selfish) were to be split apart; collectives underwent forced rotation of sex partners (including allegations that some male leaders rotated women between collectives in order to sleep with them) and in some cases engaged in sexual orgies. This formation continued during 1969 and 1970 until the group went underground and a more relaxed lifestyle was adopted as the group blended into the counterculture.\nLife in the collectives could be particularly hard for women, who made up about half the members. Their political awakening had included a growing awareness of sexism, yet they often found that men took the lead in political activities and discussion, with women often engaging in domestic work, as well as finding themselves confined to second-tier leadership roles. Certain feminist political beliefs had to be disavowed or muted and the women had to prove, regardless of prior activist credentials, that they were as capable as men in engaging in political action as part of \"women's cadres\", which were felt to be driven by coerced machismo and failed to promote genuine solidarity amongst the women. While the Weathermen's sexual politics did allow women to assert desire and explore relationships with each other, it also made them vulnerable to sexual exploitation.\nRecruitment.\nWeather used various means by which to recruit new members and set into motion a nationwide revolt against the government. Weather members aimed to mobilize people into action against the established leaders of the nation and the patterns of injustice which existed in America and abroad due to America's presence overseas. They also aimed to convince people to resist reliance upon their given privilege and to rebel and take arms if necessary. According to Weatherman, if people tolerated the unjust actions of the state, they became complicit in those actions. In the manifesto compiled by Ayers, Dohrn, Jones, and Celia Sojourn, entitled \"Prairie Fire: The Politics of Revolutionary Anti-Imperialism,\" Weatherman explained that their intention was to encourage the people and provoke leaps in confidence and consciousness in an attempt to stir the imagination, organize the masses, and join in the people's day-to-day struggles in every way possible.\nIn the year 1960, over a third of America's population was under 18 years of age. The number of young citizens set the stage for a widespread revolt against perceived structures of racism, sexism, and classism, the violence of the Vietnam War and America's interventions abroad. At college campuses throughout the country, anger against \"the Establishment's\" practices prompted both peaceful and violent protest.\nThe members of Weatherman targeted high school and college students, assuming they would be willing to rebel against the authoritative figures who had oppressed them, including cops, principals, and bosses. Weather aimed to develop roots within the class struggle, targeting white working-class youths. The younger members of the working class became the focus of the organizing effort because they felt the oppression strongly in regard to the military draft, low-wage jobs, and schooling.\nSchools became a common place of recruitment for the movement. In direct actions, dubbed Jailbreaks, Weather members invaded educational institutions as a means by which to recruit high school and college students. The motivation of these jailbreaks was the organization's belief that school was where the youth were oppressed by the system and where they learned to tolerate society's faults instead of rise against them. According to \"Prairie Fire\", young people are channeled, coerced, misled, miseducated, misused in the school setting. It is in schools that the youth of the nation become alienated from the authentic processes of learning about the world.\nFactions of the Weatherman organization began recruiting members by applying their own strategies. Women's groups such as The Motor City Nine and Cell 16 took the lead in various recruitment efforts. Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz, a member of the radical women's liberation group Cell 16 spoke about her personal recruitment agenda saying that she wanted their group to go out in every corner of the country and tell women the truth, recruit the local people, poor and working-class people, in order to build a new society.\nBerger explains the controversy surrounding recruitment strategies saying, \"As an organizing strategy it was less than successful: white working class youths were more alienated than organized by Weather's spectacles, and even some of those interested in the group were turned off by its early hi-jinks.\"\nArmed propaganda.\nIn 2006, Dan Berger (writer, activist, and longtime anti-racism organizer) states that following their initial set of bombings, which resulted in the Greenwich Village townhouse explosion, the organization adopted a new paradigm of direct action set forth in the communiqu\u00e9 \"New Morning, Changing Weather\", which abjured attacks on people. The shift in the organization's outlook was in good part due to the 1970 death of Weatherman Terry Robbins, Diana Oughton and Ted Gold, all graduate students, in the Greenwich Village townhouse explosion.\nAccording to Dan Berger a relatively sophisticated program of armed propaganda was adopted. This consisted of a series of bombings of government and corporate targets in retaliation for specific imperialist and oppressive acts. Small, well-constructed time bombs were used, generally in vents in restrooms, which exploded at times the spaces were empty. Timely warnings were made, and communiqu\u00e9s issued explaining the reason for the actions.\nMajor activities.\nHaymarket Police Memorial bombing.\nShortly before the Days of Rage demonstrations on October 6, 1969, the Weatherman planted a bomb which blew up a statue in Chicago commemorating the deaths of police officers during the 1886 Haymarket Riot. The blast broke nearly 100 windows and scattered pieces of the statue onto the Kennedy Expressway below. The city rebuilt the statue and unveiled it on May 4, 1970, but the Weathermen blew it up as well on October 6, 1970. The city rebuilt the statue once again, and Mayor Richard J. Daley posted a 24-hour police guard to protect it, but the Weathermen destroyed the third one, as well. The city compromised and rebuilt the monument once more, but this time they located it at Chicago Police Headquarters.\n\"Days of Rage\".\nOne of the first acts of the Weathermen after splitting from SDS was to announce they would hold the \"Days of Rage\" that autumn. This was advertised to \"Bring the war home!\" Hoping to cause sufficient chaos to \"wake\" the American public out of what they saw as complacency toward the role of the U.S. in the Vietnam War, the Weathermen meant it to be the largest protest of the decade. They had been told by their regional cadre to expect thousands to attend; however, when they arrived, they found only a few hundred people.\nAccording to Ayers in 2003, \"The Days of Rage was an attempt to break from the norms of kind of acceptable theatre of 'here are the anti-war people: containable, marginal, predictable, and here's the little path they're going to march down, and here's where they can make their little statement.' We wanted to say, \"No, what we're going to do is whatever we had to do to stop the violence in Vietnam.'\" The protests did not meet Ayers' stated expectations.\nThough the October 8, 1969, rally in Chicago had failed to draw as many as the Weathermen had anticipated, the two or three hundred who did attend shocked police by rioting through the affluent Gold Coast neighborhood. They smashed the windows of a bank and those of many cars. The crowd ran four blocks before encountering police barricades. They charged the police but broke into small groups; more than 1,000 police counter attacked. Many protesters were wearing motorcycle or football helmets, but the police were well trained and armed. Large amounts of tear gas were used, and at least twice police ran squad cars into the mob. The rioting lasted about half an hour, during which 28 policemen were injured. Six Weathermen were shot by the police and an unknown number injured; 68 rioters were arrested.\nFor the next two days, the Weathermen held no rallies or protests. Supporters of the RYM II movement, led by Klonsky and Noel Ignatin, held peaceful rallies in front of the federal courthouse, an International Harvester factory, and Cook County Hospital. The largest event of the Days of Rage took place on Friday, October 9, when RYM II led an interracial march of 2,000 people through a Spanish-speaking part of Chicago.\nOn October 10, the Weathermen attempted to regroup and resume their demonstrations. About 300 protesters marched through The Loop, Chicago's main business district, watched by a double line of heavily armed police. The protesters suddenly broke through the police lines and rampaged through the Loop, smashing the windows of cars and stores. The police were prepared, and quickly isolated the rioters. Within 15 minutes, more than half the crowd had been arrested.\nThe Days of Rage cost Chicago and the state of Illinois about $183,000 ($100,000 for National Guard expenses, $35,000 in damages, and $20,000 for one injured citizen's medical expenses). Most of the Weathermen and SDS leaders were now in jail, and the Weathermen would have to pay over $243,000 for their bail.\nFlint War Council.\nThe Flint War Council was a series of meetings of the Weather Underground Organization and associates in Flint, Michigan, that took place 27\u201331 December 1969. During these meetings, the decisions were made for the Weather Underground Organization to go underground and to \"engage in guerilla warfare against the U.S. government.\" This decision was made in response to increased pressure from law enforcement, and a belief that underground guerilla warfare was the best way to combat the U.S. government.\nDuring a closed-door meeting of the Weather Underground's leadership, the decision was also taken to abolish Students for a Democratic Society. This decision reflected the splintering of SDS into hostile rival factions.\nNew York City arson attacks.\nOn February 21, 1970, at around 4:30\u00a0a.m., three gasoline-filled Molotov cocktails exploded in front of the home of New York Supreme Court Justice John M. Murtagh, who was presiding over the pretrial hearings of the so-called \"Panther 21\" members of the Black Panther Party over a plot to bomb New York landmarks and department stores. Justice Murtagh and his family were unharmed, but two panes of a front window were shattered, an overhanging wooden eave was scorched, and the paint on a car in the garage was charred. \"Free the Panther 21\" and \"Viet Cong have won\" were written in large red letters on the sidewalk in front of the judge's house at 529 W. 217th Street in the Inwood neighborhood of Manhattan. The judge's house had been under hourly police surveillance and an unidentified woman called the police a few minutes before the explosions to report several prowlers there, which resulted in a police car being sent immediately to the scene.\nIn the preceding hours, Molotov cocktails had been thrown at the second floor of Columbia University's International Law Library at 434 W. 116th Street and at a police car parked across the street from the Charles Street police station in the West Village in Manhattan, and at Army and Navy recruiting booths on Nostrand Avenue on the eastern fringe of the Brooklyn College campus in Brooklyn, causing no or minimal damage in incidents of unknown relation to that at Judge Murtagh's home.\nAccording to the December 6, 1970, \"New Morning\u2014Changing Weather\" Weather Underground communiqu\u00e9 signed by Dohrn, and Wilkerson's 2007 memoir, the fire-bombing of Judge Murtagh's home, in solidarity with the Panther 21, was carried out by four members of the New York cell that was devastated two weeks later by the March 6, 1970, townhouse explosion.\nGreenwich Village townhouse explosion.\nWeather Underground members Diana Oughton, Ted Gold, Terry Robbins, Wilkerson, and Kathy Boudin were making bombs in a Greenwich Village townhouse on March 6, 1970, when one of the bombs detonated. Oughton, Gold, and Robbins were killed; Wilkerson and Boudin escaped unharmed.\nThese bombs were made to target a Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) dance at Fort Dix, which would be attended by non-commissioned officers and their companions, as well as Butler Library at Columbia University. An FBI report stated that they had enough explosives to \"level\u00a0... both sides of the street\". Weather Underground leadership members Bill Ayers, Bernardine Dohrn, and Jeff Jones claimed the planned bombings of the Fort Dix NCO dance and Columbia University building were a rogue operation led by more extreme Greenwich Village townhouse residents, Ayers singling out Terry Robbins. However, later researchers concluded Weather Underground leaders planned and approved the bombings of an NCO dance, a Columbia University building, and several bombings in Detroit which were defused by the Detroit Police aided by informant Larry Grathwohl.\nThe site of the Village explosion was the former residence of Charles Merrill, co-founder of the Merrill Lynch brokerage firm, and the childhood home of his son James Merrill. James Merrill memorialized the event in his poem \"18 West 11th Street\", the address of the brownstone townhouse.\nUnderground strategy change.\nAfter the Greenwich Village townhouse explosion, per the December 1969 Flint War Council decisions the group was now well underground, and began to refer to themselves as the Weather Underground Organization. At this juncture, WUO shrank considerably, becoming even fewer than they had been when first formed. The group was devastated by the loss of their friends, and in late April 1970, members of the Weathermen met in California to discuss what had happened in New York and the future of the organization.\nIn 2003, Weather Underground members stated in interviews that they had wanted to convince the American public that the United States was truly responsible for the calamity in Vietnam. The group began striking at night, bombing empty offices, with warnings always issued in advance to ensure a safe evacuation. According to David Gilbert, who took part in the 1981 Brink's robbery that killed two police officers and a Brink's guard, and was jailed for murder, \"[their] goal was to not hurt any people, and a lot of work went into that. But we wanted to pick targets that showed to the public who was responsible for what was really going on.\" After the Greenwich Village explosion, in a review of the documentary film \"The Weather Underground\" (2002), a \"Guardian\" journalist restated the film's contention that no one was killed by WUO bombs.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We were very careful from the moment of the townhouse on to be sure we weren't going to hurt anybody, and we never did hurt anybody. Whenever we put a bomb in a public space, we had figured out all kinds of ways to put checks and balances on the thing and also to get people away from it, and we were remarkably successful.\nDeclaration of war.\nIn response to the death of Black Panther members Fred Hampton and Mark Clark in December 1969 during a police raid, and the Kent State Shootings 5 months later, on May 21, 1970, the Weather Underground issued a \"Declaration of War\" against the United States government, using for the first time its new name, the \"Weather Underground Organization\" (WUO), adopting fake identities, and pursuing covert activities only. These initially included preparations for a bombing of a U.S. military non-commissioned officers' dance at Fort Dix, New Jersey, in what Brian Flanagan said had been intended to be \"the most horrific hit the United States government had ever suffered on its territory\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We've known that our job is to lead white kids into armed revolution. We never intended to spend the next five to twenty-five years of our lives in jail. Ever since SDS became revolutionary, we've been trying to show how it is possible to overcome frustration and impotence that comes from trying to reform this system. Kids know the lines are drawn: revolution is touching all of our lives. Tens of thousands have learned that protest and marches don't do it. Revolutionary violence is the only way.\u2014\u200a\nDohrn subsequently stated that it was Fred Hampton's death that prompted the Weather Underground to declare war on the U.S. government.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We felt that the murder of Fred required us to be more grave, more serious, more determined to raise the stakes and not just be the white people who wrung their hands when black people were being murdered.\nIn December 1969, the Chicago Police Department, in conjunction with the FBI, conducted a raid on the home of Black Panther Fred Hampton, in which he and Mark Clark were killed, with four of the seven other people in the apartment wounded. The survivors of the raid were all charged with assault and attempted murder. The police claimed they shot in self-defense, although a controversy arose when the Panthers, other activists and a Chicago newspaper reporter presented visual evidence, as well as the testimony of an FBI ballistics expert, showing that the sleeping Panthers were not resisting arrest and fired only one shot, as opposed to the more than one hundred the police fired into the apartment. The charges were later dropped, and the families of the dead won a $1.8 million settlement from the government. It was discovered in 1971 that Hampton had been targeted by the FBI's COINTELPRO. True to Dohrn's words, this single event, in the continuing string of public killings of black leaders of any political stripe, was the trigger that pushed a large number of Weatherman and other students who had just attended the last SDS national convention months earlier to go underground and develop its logistical support network nationally.\nOn May 21, 1970, a communiqu\u00e9 from the Weather Underground was issued promising to attack a \"symbol or institution of American injustice\" within two weeks. The communiqu\u00e9 included taunts towards the FBI, daring them to try to find the group, whose members were spread throughout the United States. Many leftist organizations showed curiosity in the communiqu\u00e9, and waited to see if the act would in fact occur. However, two weeks would pass without any occurrence. Then on June 9, 1970, their first publicly acknowledged bombing occurred at a New York City police station. The FBI placed the Weather Underground organization on the ten most-wanted list by the end of 1970.\nActivity in 1970.\nOn June 9, 1970, a bomb made with ten sticks of dynamite exploded in the 240 Centre Street headquarters of the New York City Police Department. The explosion was preceded by a warning about six minutes prior to the detonation and was followed by a WUO claim of responsibility.\nOn July 23, 1970, a Detroit federal grand jury indicted 13 Weathermen members in a national bombing conspiracy, along with several unnamed co-conspirators. Ten of the thirteen already had outstanding federal warrants.\nIn September 1970, the group accepted a $25,000 payment from the largest international psychedelic drug distribution organization, called The Brotherhood of Eternal Love, to break LSD advocate Timothy Leary out of a California prison in San Luis Obispo, north of Santa Barbara, California, and transport him and his wife to Algeria, where Leary joined Eldridge Cleaver.\nIn October 1970, Dohrn was put on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List.\nUnited States Capitol bombing.\nOn March 1, 1971, members of the Weather Underground set off a bomb on the Senate side of the United States Capitol. While the bomb smashed windows and caused hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of damage, there were no casualties.\nPentagon bombing.\nOn May 19, 1972, Ho Chi Minh's birthday, the Weather Underground placed a bomb in the women's bathroom in the Air Force wing of the Pentagon. The damage caused flooding that destroyed computer tapes holding classified information. Other radical groups worldwide applauded the bombing, illustrated by German youths protesting against American military systems in Frankfurt. This was \"in retaliation for the U.S. bombing raid in Hanoi.\"\nWithdrawal of charges.\nIn 1973, the government requested dropping charges against most of the WUO members. The requests cited a recent decision by the Supreme Court of the United States that barred electronic surveillance without a court order. This Supreme Court decision would hamper any prosecution of the WUO cases. In addition, the government did not want to reveal foreign intelligence secrets that a trial would require. Bernardine Dohrn was removed from the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List on 7 December 1973. As with the earlier federal grand juries that subpoenaed Leslie Bacon and Stew Albert in the U.S. Capitol bombing case, these investigations were known as \"fishing expeditions\", with the evidence gathered through \"black bag\" jobs including illegal mail openings that involved the FBI and United States Postal Service, burglaries by FBI field offices, and electronic surveillance by the Central Intelligence Agency against the support network, friends, and family members of the Weather Underground as part of Nixon's COINTELPRO apparatus.\nThese grand juries caused Sylvia Jane Brown, Robert Gelbhard, and future members of the Seattle Weather Collective to be subpoenaed in Seattle and Portland for the investigation of one of the first (and last) captured WUO members. Four months afterwards the cases were dismissed. The decisions in these cases led directly to the subsequent resignation of FBI Director, L. Patrick Gray, and the federal indictments of W. Mark Felt or \"Deep Throat\" and Edwin Miller and which, earlier, was the factor leading to the removal of federal \"most-wanted\" status against members of the Weather Underground leadership in 1973.\n\"Prairie Fire\".\nWith the help of Clayton Van Lydegraf, the Weather Underground sought a more Marxist\u2013Leninist ideological approach to the post-Vietnam reality. The leading members of the Weather Underground (Bill Ayers, Bernardine Dohrn, Jeff Jones, and Celia Sojourn) collaborated on ideas and published a manifesto: \"Prairie Fire: The Politics of Revolutionary Anti-Imperialism.\" The name came from a quote by Mao Zedong, \"a single spark can set a prairie fire.\" By the summer of 1974, five thousand copies had surfaced in coffee houses, bookstores and public libraries across the U.S. Leftist newspapers praised the manifesto.\nAbbie Hoffman publicly praised \"Prairie Fire\" and believed every American should be given a copy. The manifesto's influence initiated the formation of the Prairie Fire Organizing Committee in several American cities. Hundreds of above-ground activists helped further the new political vision of the Weather Underground. Essentially, after the 1969 failure of the Days of Rage to involve thousands of youths in massive street fighting, Weather renounced most of the Left and decided to operate as an isolated underground group. Prairie Fire urged people to never \"dissociate mass struggle from revolutionary violence\". To do so, asserted Weather, was to do the state's work. Just as in 1969\u20131970, Weather still refused to renounce revolutionary violence for \"to leave people unprepared to fight the state is to seriously mislead them about the inevitable nature of what lies ahead\". However, the decision to build only an underground group caused the Weather Underground to lose sight of its commitment to mass struggle and made future alliances with the mass movement difficult and tenuous.\nBy 1974, Weather had recognized this shortcoming and in \"Prairie Fire\" detailed a different strategy for the 1970s which demanded both mass and clandestine organizations. The role of a clandestine organization would be to build the \"consciousness of action\" and prepare the way for the development of a people's militia. Concurrently, the role of the mass movement (i.e., above-ground Prairie Fire collective) would include support for, and encouragement of, armed action. Such an alliance would, according to Weather, \"help create the 'sea' for the guerrillas to swim in\".\nAccording to Bill Ayers, writing in 2001, by the late 1970s, the Weatherman group had further split into two factions\u2014the May 19th Communist Organization and the Prairie Fire Collective\u2014with Bernardine Dohrn and Bill Ayers in the latter. The Prairie Fire Collective favored coming out of hiding and establishing an above-ground revolutionary mass movement. With most WUO members facing limited criminal charges (most charges had been dropped by the government in 1973) against them creating an above-ground organization was more feasible. The May 19 Communist Organization continued in hiding as the clandestine organization. A decisive factor in Dohrn's coming out of hiding was her concerns about her children. The Prairie Fire Collective faction started to surrender to the authorities from the late 1970s to the early 1980s. The remaining Weather Underground members continued to attack U.S. institutions.\nCOINTELPRO.\nEvent.\nIn April 1971, the \"Citizens' Commission to Investigate the FBI\" broke into an FBI office in Media, Pennsylvania. The group stole files with several hundred pages. The files detailed the targeting of civil rights leaders, labor rights organizations, and left-wing groups in general, and included documentation of acts of intimidation and disinformation by the FBI and attempts to erode public support for those popular movements. By the end of April, the FBI offices were to terminate all files dealing with leftist groups. The files were part of an FBI program called COINTELPRO.\nAfter COINTELPRO was dissolved in 1971 by J. Edgar Hoover, the FBI continued its counterintelligence on groups like the Weather Underground. In 1973, the FBI established the \"Special Target Information Development\" program, where agents were sent undercover to penetrate the Weather Underground. Due to the illegal tactics of FBI agents involved with the program, government attorneys requested all weapons- and bomb-related charges be dropped against the Weather Underground. The most well-publicized of these tactics were the \"black-bag jobs\", referring to searches conducted in the homes of relatives and acquaintances of Weatherman. The Weather Underground was no longer a fugitive organization and could turn themselves in with minimal charges against them. Additionally, the illegal domestic spying conducted by the CIA in collaboration with the FBI also lessened the legal repercussions for Weatherman turning themselves in.\nInvestigation and trial.\nAfter the Church Committee revealed the FBI's illegal activities, many agents were investigated. In 1976, former FBI Associate Director W. Mark Felt publicly stated he had ordered break-ins and that individual agents were merely obeying orders and should not be punished for it. Felt also stated that acting Director L. Patrick Gray had also authorized the break-ins, but Gray denied this. Felt said on the CBS television program \"Face the Nation\" that he would probably be a \"scapegoat\" for the Bureau's work. \"I think this is justified and I'd do it again tomorrow,\" he said on the program. While admitting the break-ins were \"extralegal\", he justified it as protecting the \"greater good\". Felt said, \"To not take action against these people and know of a bombing in advance would simply be to stick your fingers in your ears and protect your eardrums when the explosion went off and then start the investigation.\"\nThe Attorney General in the new Carter administration, Griffin Bell, investigated, and on April 10, 1978, a federal grand jury charged Felt, Edward S. Miller, and Gray with conspiracy to violate the constitutional rights of American citizens by searching their homes without warrants. Gray's case did not go to trial and was dropped by the government for lack of evidence on December 11, 1980.\nThe indictment charged violations of Title 18, Section 241 of the United States Code. The indictment charged Felt and the others \"did unlawfully, willfully, and knowingly combine, conspire, confederate, and agree together and with each other to injure and oppress citizens of the United States who were relatives and acquaintances of the Weatherman fugitives, in the free exercise and enjoyments of certain rights and privileges secured to them by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America.\"\nFelt and Miller attempted to plea bargain with the government, willing to agree to a misdemeanor guilty plea to conducting searches without warrants\u2014a violation of 18 U.S.C. sec. 2236\u2014but the government rejected the offer in 1979. After eight postponements, the case against Felt and Miller went to trial in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on September 18, 1980. On October 29, former President Richard Nixon appeared as a rebuttal witness for the defense, and testified that presidents since Franklin D. Roosevelt had authorized the bureau to engage in break-ins while conducting foreign intelligence and counterespionage investigations.\nIt was Nixon's first courtroom appearance since his resignation in 1974. Nixon also contributed money to Felt's legal defense fund, with Felt's legal expenses running over $600,000. Also testifying were former Attorneys General Herbert Brownell Jr., Nicholas Katzenbach, Ramsey Clark, John N. Mitchell, and Richard G. Kleindienst, all of whom said warrantless searches in national security matters were commonplace and not understood to be illegal, but Mitchell and Kleindienst denied they had authorized any of the break-ins at issue in the trial.\nThe jury returned guilty verdicts on November 6, 1980. Although the charge carried a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, Felt was fined $5,000. (Miller was fined $3,500.) Writing in \"The New York Times\" a week after the conviction, Roy Cohn claimed that Felt and Miller were being used as scapegoats by the Carter administration and that it was an unfair prosecution. Cohn wrote it was the \"final dirty trick\" and that there had been no \"personal motive\" for their actions.\n\"The Times\" saluted the convictions, saying that it showed \"the case has established that zeal is no excuse for violating the Constitution\". Felt and Miller appealed the verdict, and they were later pardoned by Ronald Reagan.\nDissolution.\nDespite the change in their legal status, the Weather Underground remained underground for a few more years. However, by 1976 the organization was disintegrating. The Weather Underground held a conference in Chicago called Hard Times. The idea was to create an umbrella organization for all radical groups. However, the event turned sour when Hispanic and Black groups accused the Weather Underground and the Prairie Fire Committee of limiting their roles in racial issues. The Weather Underground faced accusations of abandonment of the revolution by reversing their original ideology.\nThe conference increased divisions within the Weather Underground. East coast members favored a commitment to violence and challenged the commitments of old leaders, Dohrn, Ayers, and Jones. These older members found they were no longer liable for federal prosecution because of illegal wire taps and the government's unwillingness to reveal sources and methods favored a strategy of inversion where they would be above-ground \"revolutionary leaders\". Jeremy Varon argues that by 1977 the WUO had disbanded.\nMatthew Steen appeared on the lead segment of CBS's \"60 Minutes\" in 1976 and was interviewed by Mike Wallace about the ease of creating fake identification, the first ex-Weatherman interview on national television. (The House document has the date wrong, it aired February 1, 1976, and the title was Fake ID.)\nThe federal government estimated that only 38 Weathermen had gone underground in 1970, though the estimates varied widely, according to a variety of official and unofficial sources, as between 50 and 600 members. Most modern sources lean towards a much larger number than the FBI reference. An FBI estimate in 1976, or slightly later, of the current membership was down to 30 or fewer.\nPlot to bomb the office of a California State Senator.\nIn November 1977, five WUO members were arrested on conspiracy to bomb the office of California State Senator John Briggs. It was later revealed that the Revolutionary Committee and the PFOC had both been infiltrated by the FBI for almost six years. FBI agents Richard J. Gianotti and William D. Reagan lost their cover in November when federal judges needed their testimony to issue warrants for the arrest of Clayton Van Lydegraf and four Weather people. The arrests were the results of the infiltration. WUO members Judith Bissell, Thomas Justesen, Leslie Mullin, and Marc Curtis pleaded guilty while Van Lydegraf, who helped write the 1974 Prairie Fire Manifesto, went to trial.\nWithin two years, many members took advantage of President Jimmy Carter's amnesty for draft dodgers by turning themselves in. Mark Rudd turned himself into authorities on January 20, 1978. Rudd was fined $4,000 and received two years' probation. Bernardine Dohrn and Bill Ayers turned themselves in on December 3, 1980, in New York, with substantial media coverage. Charges were dropped for Ayers. Dohrn received three years' probation and a $15,000 fine.\nBrink's robbery.\nSome members remained underground and joined splinter radical groups. The U.S. government states that years after the dissolution of the Weather Underground, three former members, Kathy Boudin, Judith Alice Clark, and David Gilbert, joined the May 19 Communist Organization, and on October 20, 1981, in Nanuet, New York, the group helped the Black Liberation Army rob a Brink's armored truck containing $1.6 million. The robbery resulted in a shootout and the deaths of Brink's Guard Peter Paige, Police Sergeant Edward O'Grady Jr., and Police Officer Waverly Brown, the first black police officer on the Nyack police force.\nBoudin, Clark, and Gilbert were found guilty and sentenced to lengthy terms in prison. Media reports listed them as former Weatherman Underground members considered the \"last gasps\" of the Weather Underground. The documentary \"The Weather Underground\" described the Brink's robbery as the \"unofficial end\" of the Weather Underground.\nMay 19th Communist Organization.\nThe Weather Underground members who were involved in the May 19th Communist Organization's alliance with the Black Liberation Army continued to perpetrate a series of jail breaks, armed robberies and bombings until 1985, when most of them were finally arrested and sentenced for their involvement in the Brink's robbery and the Resistance Conspiracy case.\nCoalitions with non-WUO members.\nThroughout their years in the underground, the members of the Weather Underground worked closely with their counterparts in other organizations, including Jane Alpert, to bring attention to their further actions to the press. She helped the Weathermen pursue their main goal of overthrowing the U.S. government through her writings. However, there were tensions within the organization, brought about by her famous manifesto, \"Mother Right\", that specifically called on the female members of the organization to focus on their own cause rather than anti-imperialist causes. Weather members then wrote in response to her manifesto.\nLegacy.\nWidely known members of the Weather Underground include Kathy Boudin, Linda Sue Evans, Brian Flanagan, David Gilbert, Ted Gold, Naomi Jaffe, Jeff Jones, Joe Kelly, Diana Oughton, Eleanor Raskin, Terry Robbins, Mark Rudd, Matthew Steen, Susan Stern, Laura Whitehorn, Eric Mann, Cathy Wilkerson, and the married couple Bernardine Dohrn and Bill Ayers.\nThe Weather Underground was referred to as a terrorist group by articles in \"The New York Times\", United Press International, and \"Time\". The group fell under the jurisdiction of the FBI-New York City Police Anti-Terrorist Task Force, a forerunner of the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Forces. The FBI refers to the organization in a 2004 news story titled \"Byte out of History\" published on its website as having been a \"domestic terrorist group\" that is no longer an active concern. Some members have disputed the \"terrorist\" categorization and justified the group's actions as an appropriate response to what they described as the \"terrorist activities\" of the war in Vietnam, domestic racism, and the deaths of black leaders.\nAyers objected to the description of the WUO as a terrorist organization in his 2001 book \"Fugitive Days\". \"Terrorists terrorize,\" he argues, \"they kill innocent civilians, while we organized and agitated. Terrorists destroy randomly, while our actions bore, we hoped, the precise stamp of a cut diamond. Terrorists intimidate, while we aimed only to educate.\" Dan Berger asserts in \"Outlaws of America\" that the group \"purposefully and successfully avoided injuring anyone\" as an argument that their actions were not terrorism. \"Its war against property by definition means that the WUO was not a terrorist organization.\"\nOthers, however, have suggested that these arguments are specious. Former Weather Underground member Mark Rudd admitted that the group intended to target people prior to the accidental explosion in the town house. \"On the morning of March 6, 1970, three of my comrades were building pipe bombs packed with dynamite and nails, destined for a dance of non-commissioned officers and their dates at Fort Dix, New Jersey, that night.\" Grand juries were convened in 2001 and 2009 to investigate whether Weather Underground was responsible for the San Francisco Police Department Park Station bombing, in which one officer was killed, one was maimed, and eight more were wounded by shrapnel from a pipe bomb. They ultimately concluded that members of the Black Liberation Army were responsible, with whom WUO members were affiliated. They were also responsible for the bombing of another police precinct in San Francisco, as well as bombing the Catholic Church funeral services of the police officer killed in the Park Precinct bombing in the early summer of 1970. Ayers said in a 2001 \"New York Times\" interview, \"I don't regret setting bombs\". He has since claimed that he was misquoted. Mark Rudd teaches mathematics at Central New Mexico Community College, and he has said that he doesn't speak publicly about his experiences because he has \"mixed feelings, guilt and shame\". \"These are things I am not proud of, and I find it hard to speak publicly about them and to tease out what was right from what was wrong.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "33986", "revid": "4689348", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33986", "title": "War hammer", "text": "A war hammer (French: \"martel-de-fer\", \"iron hammer\") is a weapon that was used by both foot soldiers and cavalry. It is a very old weapon and gave its name, owing to its constant use, to Judah Maccabee, a 2nd-century BC Jewish rebel, and to Charles Martel, one of the rulers of France. In the 15th and 16th centuries, the war hammer became an elaborately decorated and handsome weapon.\nThe war hammer was a popular weapon in the late medieval period. It became somewhat of a necessity in combat when armor became so strong that swords and axes were no longer able to pierce and ricocheted upon impact. The war hammer could inflict significant damage on the enemy through their heavy impact without the need to pierce the armor.\nDesign.\nA war hammer consists of a handle and a head. The length of the handle may vary, the longest being roughly equivalent to that of a halberd (five to six feet or 1.5 to 1.8 meters), and the shortest about the same as that of a mace (two to three feet or 60 to 90 centimeters). Long war hammers were polearms meant for use by foot soldiers, whereas shorter ones were primarily used by those mounted.\nWar hammers, especially when mounted on a pole, could in some cases transmit their impact through helmets and cause concussions. Later war hammers often had a spike on one side of the head, making them more versatile weapons.\nThe back spike could be used for hooking a target's armor, reins, or shield. The blunt side of a war hammer was usually used first to knock down and stun an enemy and, once the opponent were immobilized on the ground, the hammer is rotated around to hit the target with the pointed side, which can punch a hole through the helmet and deliver the coup de gr\u00e2ce. A powerful swing from a war hammer (especially with the spike) can deliver a strike force of several hundred kilograms per square millimeter\u00a0\u2013 this is the same penetrating force as a rifle bullet.\nMaul.\nA maul is a long-handled hammer with a heavy head, of wood, lead, iron, or steel. It is similar in appearance and function to a modern sledgehammer, it is sometimes shown as having a spear-like spike on the fore-end of the shaft.\nThe use of the maul as a weapon seems to date from the later 14th century. During the Harelle of 1382, rebellious citizens of Paris seized 3,000 mauls () from the city armory, leading to the rebels' being dubbed \"Maillotins\". Later in the same year, Froissart records French men-at-arms using mauls at the Battle of Roosebeke, demonstrating that they were not simply weapons of the lower classes.\nA particular use of the maul was by archers in the 15th and 16th centuries. At the Battle of Agincourt, English longbowmen are recorded as using lead mauls, initially as a tool to drive in stakes but later as improvised weapons. Other references during the century (for example, in Charles the Bold's 1472 Ordinance) suggest continued use. They are recorded as a weapon of Tudor archers as late as 1562.\nHistory.\nFull-fledged warhammers emerged in the mid-14th century as a direct response to the growing prevalence and effectiveness of plate armor on European battlefields. By 1395, French infantry deployed sophisticated warhammers equipped with thrusting tips, side flanges, and a basic beak, known as \"Picoise.\" These initially single-handed warhammers would later evolve into longer two-handed pole hammers, becoming not only widespread on European battlefields but also prominent in duels, particularly those involving armored combatants in tournaments or judicial settings. \nIn the context of duels, the pole hammer was often categorized as a subtype of the pole-axe, commonly referred to as \"axes\" in period fencing manuals (German: (Mord)Axt, Italian: (Azza)). Pole hammers designed for duels frequently featured a rondel-shaped guard to protect the forward hand and a spike at the rear for increased versatility. Some variants also incorporated additional hooks at the rear to facilitate binding enemy weapons and limbs. While earlier pole hammers had flat surfaces, by the 15th century, there was a trend towards dividing the hammerhead into three or four diamond-shaped tips to avoid the head of the weapon from sliding on armor plate and to focus the impact onto a smaller area. According to Austrian army officer and weapons expert Wendelin Boeheim, these modifications were primarily driven by aesthetic considerations rather than functional improvements. In some instances, the hammer surface featured the monogram of its owner, enabling the identification of victims on the battlefield. \nStarting from the 15th century, shorter warhammers found use as cavalry weapons. Initially rejected by the nobility due to their commoner origins, practicality eventually compelled their adoption. This perception would later shift, with cavalry commanders, known as Rottmeister (lit. packmaster), carrying warhammers both as weapons and symbols of rank. These hammers became known as \"Rottmeister hammers\" or \"packmaster hammers.\" In landsknecht armies, a similar connotation existed, where hammers evolved into status symbols among the lower nobility in eastern parts of central Europe (Poland-Lithuania/Hungary), second only to sabers in prestige. According to Polish aristocrat Andrzej Kitowicz, a nobleman would not leave his house without his saber and his warhammer, which could also serve as a walking stick. Late Central European hammers can be categorized into three subtypes: the Czekan, a warhammer with a flattened square or hexagonal surface and a bearded axe blade on the back; the Nadziak, a classic warhammer with a flattened square or hexagonal surface and a beak at the back; and the Ogbur, similar to the Nadziak but with an S-shaped or strictly curved beak on the back. All these types shared the characteristic of having staffs made from hard wood, often extending over the socket, and lacking a thrusting tip. \nWhile the warhammer fell out of favor in most parts of Europe, it remained popular in Poland and Hungary until the first half of the 18th century. \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His travel accounts, as well as those of another trader, Ohthere of H\u00e5logaland, were included in the \"Old English Orosius\". It is unclear if Wulfstan was English or indeed if he was from Hedeby, in what is now northern Germany near the city of Schleswig but in the 9th century was Danish.\nAccording to this account, Wulfstan undertook a journey by sea from Hedeby to the Prussian trading centre of Truso around the year 880.

{"id": "33994", "revid": "49402000", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33994", "title": "Warren Farrell", "text": "American author, spokesperson, and political candidate\nWarren Thomas Farrell (born June 26, 1943) is an American author, educator, and activist best known for his writings on gender, particularly men's issues. Initially active in the second wave feminist movement of the late 1960s and 1970s, Farrell was a board member of the National Organization for Women in New York City and authored \"The Liberated Man\" (1974), which explored how traditional gender roles constrained both men and women. \u00a0He obtained his\u00a0doctorate in political science on the topic in 1974.\u00a0 His role-reversal workshops in the 1970s and early 1980s brought him mainstream attention. \u00a0Over time, he grew critical of feminism and shifted his focus toward highlighting the disadvantages and challenges faced by men.\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Farrell established himself as a leading voice in the emerging men's movement. His books \"Why Men Are the Way They Are\" (1986) and \"The Myth of Male Power\" (1993) argued that men are systematically disadvantaged in areas such as family law, education, health, and cultural representation. Farrell contended that men, often seen as \"success objects,\" bore hidden costs of traditional masculinity, from hazardous work to military conscription, while facing rising cultural hostility. These writings were widely reviewed and translated.\nFarrell's later books and talks broadened into broader relationship advice and advocacy on men's issues.\u00a0 \"Women Can't Hear What Men Don't Say\" (1999) and \"Father and Child Reunion\" (2001) addressed communication and parenting, with Farrell calling for greater recognition of fathers as caregivers. His subsequent books, including \"Why Men Earn More\" (2005) and \"Does Feminism Discriminate Against Men?\" (2008, with James P. Sterba), continued to argue that pay disparities and gender inequalities were rooted more in life choices and systemic biases against men than in widespread discrimination against women. In \"The Boy Crisis\" (2018, with John Gray), he emphasized the effects of father absence on boys' health, education, and well-being. His most recent work, \"Role Mate to Soul Mate\" (2024), extends his focus to couples' communication and conflict resolution.\nFarrell and his work have regularly been featured at fora associated with the men's rights movement, including conferences, websites, podcasts and he is often described as the intellectual father of the movement. Farrell himself denies the activist label. His work, on gender and his abandoned research on incest have sparked interest, praise, criticism and controversy. Farrell has remained a prominent public speaker and commentator, advocating for what he describes as genuine gender equality by addressing the overlooked disadvantages faced by men and boys.\nEarly life.\nFarrell was born on June 26, 1943. He is the eldest of three children born to an accountant father and a mother who struggled with her role as a housewife. His mother suffered from depression, particularly when she was not working, and died age 48 after a fall. He grew up in New Jersey, but spent time in Europe as a teenager, which taught him to challenge orthodoxies and to listen to others. Farrell graduated from Midland Park High School in New Jersey in 1961.\nFarrell received a B.A. from Montclair State University in social sciences in 1965. As a college student, Farrell was a national vice-president of the Student-National Education Association, leading President Lyndon B. Johnson to invite him to the White House Conference on Education.\nWhen he was a junior, Farrell met his first wife Ursula (\"Ursie\") at a convention. He encouraged her to speak up as she had stage fright, and the couple married in 1966. The same year, Farrell received an M.A. from the University of California, Los Angeles in political science.\nFeminist years.\nThe Farrells' marriage began with the couple following traditional gender roles. Ursula worked but did most of the domestic tasks. Farrell, in contrast, focused on developing his career as quickly as possible so he could be the main breadwinner when they had children. A mathematician and IBM executive, Ursula enjoyed working, and offered to provide for the couple while Farrell did a doctorate in political science at New York University. Farrell initially studied American government, but became interested in sex roles and the feminist movement and changed his dissertation topic. He joined the National Organization of Women (NOW) in 1969. Farrell quickly came to the conclusion that women could not be liberated until men were liberated from the constraints of their own ideas about masculinity. In 1971, he became coordinator of NOW's Task Force on the Masculine Mystique, and began a network of more than 200 men's consciousness raising groups throughout the US. For three years, he served on the board of directors of the NYC chapter of National Organization for Women (1971\u201374).\nFarrell obtained his doctorate in 1974: his dissertation topic was \"The political potential of the women's liberation movement as indicated by its effectiveness in changing men's attitude\"\".\" The same year, Farrell published \"The Liberated Man\"; written from a feminist perspective and based on his experiences with the consciousness raising groups, the book noted that men are also victimized by sexism. For example, he observed that men were forced into a role as breadwinner/provider and socialized to repress their emotions. In parallel to women's experience as \"sex objects\", Farrell labeled men's experience as \"success objects\", judged by their status and potential to earn money. As a tool for change, he provided guidelines and suggestions for consciousness raising groups in which men confronted their sexist relationships. He also proposed using gender-neutral language, including pronouns such as 'te' instead of she/he; this approach was critiqued by reviews in the New York Times by Larry McMurtry and John Leonard.\nIn 1974, Farrell left New York and his teaching at Rutgers when his wife became a White House Fellow to incoming President Gerald Ford in Washington D.C. He taught part-time at American University (1973\u201374), Georgetown University, (1973\u201375) and Brooklyn College (1975). The couple separated in 1976, and divorced in 1977.\nDuring this period, Farrell was frequently featured in the media, and mingled with luminaries and media personalities, such as Gloria Steinem and Barbara Walters. He made numerous talk show appearances, including \"The Phil Donahue Show\", and was featured in \"People.\" He was known for creating audience participation role-reversal experiences to \"let men and women walk around in each other's moccasins\".\nIn the men's beauty contest, men were invited to experience a woman's perspective, because \"for women, life...is a beauty contest in which, willing or not, every women takes part, every day of her life\". The male volunteers stripped, posed in swimming suits and were cat-called and criticized. In the \"role-reversal date\" simulations, women judged \"boys\" as sex objects based on their appearance while the men viewed women as \"success objects\" in terms of their earning potential. In another activity, women were placed into rows based on their salaries, with the lowest earners branded as 'losers'. Farrell's advocacy of men's liberation led Carol Kleiman of the Chicago Tribune to call him 'the Gloria Steinem of the men's movement\". However, Farrell became disenchanted with the feminist movement due to its stance on custody policy stances. NOW supported giving child custody to the primary caregiver, which was usually the mother. In a 1997 interview, Farrell stated: \"Everything went well until the mid-seventies when NOW came out against the presumption of joint custody. I couldn't believe the people I thought were pioneers in equality were saying that women should have the first option to have children or not to have children\u00a0\u2014\u00a0that children should not have equal rights to their dad.\" Farrell started to believe that feminists were more interested in power for women than in equality between the sexes. \nFarrell moved to California in 1978, and taught courses in sex roles and male sexuality at the California School of Professional Psychology from 1978 to 1979, and San Diego State University from 1979 to 1980. In addition, he continued giving role-reversal workshops and other lectures in the US and Canada. \nResearch into incest.\nBeginning in 1976, Farrell began writing a book on incest, with the goal of \"helping people who were traumatized\" by the experience. Wishing to go beyond those identified by legal, psycho-social or medical services, he advertised for people who had had incestuous experiences in newspapers and magazines. He interviewed more than 200 people,\u00a0and also obtained data on incestuous relations from the Kinsey studies. Between 1977 and 1986, Farrell reported his research in interviews and talks including at the 1983 World Sexology conference. He also wrote on the topic, including a chapter in the \"Handbook of Sexology: Childhood and adolescent sexology\". He challenged the notion that incest is inherently traumatic and harmful, and reported that it was often viewed positively by his informants. He stated that\u00a0outcomes of incest were almost always negative when they involved a preteen girl and an older male relative. In contrast, incest between mothers and sons, and other combinations (siblings, cousins etc.) were viewed positively by most of his\u00a0interviewees. Farrell suggested the reason for this gender difference was that women and girls are socialized to feel sexual guilt, and thus later reinterpreted their experience negatively when they learn of the incest taboo. He compared of the effects of incest to a magnifying glass in that they exacerbate difficulties in some families while strengthening relationships in others. He proposed that the terms 'incest', \u00a0'victims', 'perpetrators' should be replaced by 'family sex' and 'incest participants'.\u00a0 After some difficulty, Farrell's book found a publisher. However during the writing period, the research, its methodology and interpretations were criticized by mental health professionals, academics and feminists and Farrell abandoned the\u00a0project. Nearly twenty years later, Farrell reflected that he better understood the reaction, having raised stepchildren in the meantime. \"[I] tried to be neutral, to disengage from the horror, let the data speak for itself, then draw thoughtful, balanced conclusions. Now that I've raised two sets of stepchildren I would have a more gut-level negative reaction. The idea of touching is repulsive. If someone touched one of my daughters when she was 13, I'd be so furious.\" Farrell also stated that his views had been conflated with those of his subjects, and he was simply reporting how they justified incest.\nMen's issues.\nBy 1983 Farrell had turned his attention to the situation of men, and in 1986 published \"Why Men Are the Way They Are.\" In his book, he argued that men are the victims of a \"new sexism\", and feminists are ignoring discrimination against men, and are promoting intolerant, anti-male attitudes. He described what he believed to be each sex's primary fantasies: women to find the economic security associated with one successful man, and men to have sexual access to multiple beautiful women without risking rejection. Conflicts between the sexes are caused by each sex failing to fulfill the desires of the other. According to Farrell, it is a myth that men hold all the power in society as female expectations control men, for example to be a 'success object' \u2013 judged by their earning potential so as to attract the sexual interest of women. He taught a course based on the book at the School of Medicine at the University of California, San Diego between 1986 and 1988. He also wrote a series of articles about myths about men which were published in the media.\nIn his next book, \"The Myth of Male Power: Why Men Are the Disposable Sex,\" Farrell elaborated this theme. Published in 1993, the book asserts that the widespread perception of men having inordinate social and economic power is false, and women's sexual power negates any such leverage. He argued that men feel themselves to be disposable, and are systematically disadvantaged in many ways. He noted that men are more likely die or be injured during war and urban violence, and that only men are subject to conscription in the US.\"\" Men's life expectation is lower than women's, and more men than women die by suicide. He suggested that research funding is skewed towards women, pointing to more funding for breast cancer than for prostate cancer. He asserted that while some men have high paying jobs with prestige, but most have far less power, and do dangerous and dirty jobs in order to support women or children\".\"\"\" He posited that the reason for the pay gap between men and women is the career/family choices women make. He noted that men are also the victims of domestic violence\"\" and rape.\"\" He stated that many rape accusations and sexual harassment claims are false, the result of misunderstandings\".\"\"\" He attacked affirmative action programs, arguing that they increase inequality. He controversially compared the society's treatment of men to Jews during the Second World War, and to that of African Americans, writing that \"men are the new n*ggers\".\nBoth books were widely reviewed, often critically, and went into multiple editions and translations. Farrell reported that he had lost income and exposure when he researched incest and began speaking about men's issues, but following publication of these books was again solicited for presentations and interviews in the US and internationally. He appeared once more on talk shows, including the \"Oprah Winfrey Show.\"\nIn 1999, Farrell published his next book, \"Women Can't Hear What Men Don't Say: Destroying myths, creating love\". According to Farrell, the book was an attempt to build bridges between genders, by freeing all from rigid gender roles and drawing to attention to discrimination against men. In the first of three sections, Farrell tackled the issue of communication skills, including expressing feelings and giving and receiving criticism. He provided specific structure and techniques to manage disagreements. In the second section, Farrell argued against the notion that women undertake most of the housework, even when the couple are both working an equal number of hours outside the home. He suggested that men do more home work that is appreciated when all tasks are taken into account. Reviewers commented that this list of \"men's\" tasks were often ones that did not often need to be done. Farrell returned to the topic of domestic violence, stating that women are equally or more likely to assault men than men are to assault women. He provided examples of negative portrayal of men in cartoons, greeting cards, books, movies and the media. In the third section, Farrell stated that organizations including governments and the media have institutionalized \"man bashing\". He criticized the women's movement's distinction between empowerment feminism which was, in his view, positive in freeing women, and victim feminism which sees women as the victims of men. He used the term the \"Lace Curtain\" to describe and critique how institutions see gender issues from a feminist/female lens. Farrell promoted his book in presentations, workshops and tours, including to Canada.\nIn his next book \"Father and Child Reunion\", published in 2001, Farrell wrote about fathers and children. In it, he noted the desire of fathers to be seen as nurturers and raisers, not just breadwinners. He described this as a revolution in men's desire to reenter the family, parallel to women's desired to enter the workforce. He noted strengths in fathers such as teaching informed risk-taking, and maintaining firm boundaries/rules. Noting the increasing numbers of single fathers, he listed research that suggested that medical, psychological, social and educational outcomes for children being raised by single fathers in the US were better than those raised by single mothers. These fathers were older, better off, and better educated, and typically less negative towards their co-parent. He acknowledged that they were, however, self-selected and highly motivated. Farrell stated that children of divorce do better when three conditions prevail: equally-shared parenting (or joint custody); close parental proximity; and no bad-mouthing between the parents. In the years after publication, he published columns on the subject in the US media and spoke and consulted on the topic. He toured to Canada and Australia to publicize the book, making presentations, and appearing on radio and TV. His work in this area has led to him acting as an expert witness in child custody disputes.\nIn 2005, Farrell published \"Why Men Earn More: The Startling Truth Behind the Pay Gap\u2014and What Women Can Do About It,\" in which he examined the gender pay gap in the United States. In it, he listed 25 differences in men and women's work-life choices which, he argued, accounted for most or all of the pay gap more accurately than did claims of widespread discrimination against women. Farrell wrote that men chose to earn more money, while each of women's choices prioritized having a more fulfilling and balanced life. He suggested that men could learn from women the benefits of more balanced lives, and not just considering careers with high incomes, given that \"the road to high pay is a toll road.\" Farrell offered suggestions for women for achieving higher pay\u2014and accompanied each with their possible trade-offs. These included working more hours and for more years, taking technical or more hazardous jobs, and relocating overseas or traveling overnight. The book was recommended by Marty Nemko in the \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" and by Richard Bolles in \"What Color Is Your Parachute?\" as a useful career book for women. It was critiqued by others who commented on the inaccuracies and omissions in the use and interpretation of statistics and the societal and psychological claims made.\nFarrell's 2008 book, \"Does Feminism Discriminate Against Men?\", is a debate book with feminist co-author and philosopher James P. Sterba. In the book, Farrell and Sterba debated 13 topics, including criminal justice, power, work and pay, the military, health, marriage and divorce, domestic violence, rape and media bias against men. In his section, Farrell repeated themes and evidence from his past books, emphasizing his view that feminism is damaging men by failing to accept the privileges of womanhood. In this book, as at other times, Farrell addressed abortion arguing that it is unjust that a woman can unilaterally decide to keep a pregnancy, thus forcing unwilling fathers to pay child support, or end a pregnancy without input from the father. Reviewers differed on whether Farrell or Sterba's arguments were the stronger, as well as whether the book would be useful as a text at universities, with critiques of its binary, confrontational format.\nIn 2018 Farrell co-authored \"The Boy Crisis\" with John Gray, writing that boys are falling behind girls in education, physical, mental and emotional health and behavior across developed nations. The book discussed contributing factors such as educational under-performance and mental/emotional health challenges, particularly in father-absent households. Farrell and Gray argued that \"dad deprivation\", the result of high divorce rates, significantly impacts boys' outcomes in emotional and behavioral areas. They proposed that boys to be taught \"health intelligence\" to keep them happy and safe, not just the traditional \"heroic intelligence\" in which men rescue, protect and provide for others. They argued for fathers (and mothers) to be deeply involved with their children, and proposed a range of solutions for reclaiming the relationship.\nCouples coaching.\nIn recent years, Farrell has become known for his work coaching couples. In 2024, Farrell published \"Role Mate to Soul Mate\", which is based on his decades of experience teaching couples workshops. The book offers practical tips and suggestions about how to transform relationship challenges into opportunities for intimacy, and extends these methods beyond romantic relationships to communication with family, co-workers and across political divides.\nReception and influence.\nFarrell's books are known for their popular style, including short chapters with bold headings and slogans. Reviewers praise his books and presentations for raising the important topic of men's issues. They comment on the wealth of statistics and other evidence, and the thought provoking questions these raise. In addition, the books often contain useful, specific resources and suggestions. Reviewers also comment on a polemic and strident tone. They report dubious, overstated assertions, often supported by anecdotal evidence and questionable statistics.\nFarrell's books are influential in the men's rights and incel movements, with the Myth of Male Power frequently described as \"MRA bible\". He is widely regarded as the intellectual father of the men's rights movement\".\" Farrell has regularly appeared at their events. In November 2012, he spoke on men's issues at a talk the University of Toronto organized by the Canadian Association for Equality. About a hundred students protested his talk, barricading the entrance and loudly heckling attendees: a protestor was arrested. With the help of police, Farrell entered through a rear door and delivered his speech. The protest was featured by the men's rights website A Voice for Men, and few months later, Farrell met the site's founder Paul Elam. Elam had long been inspired by Farrell's writings and Farrell became his mentor. He added Farrell's writings to his website and the two began co-hosting a monthly online chat. Farrell was a featured speaker at a men's rights conference organized by A Voice for Men held in Detroit in June 2014. He appeared in Cassie Jaye's 2016 documentary film about the men's rights movement, \"The Red Pill.\" The same year, Farrell gave a keynote speech at the Male Psychology Conference at University College London. Farrell has been cited as an influence by psychologist Jordan Peterson; Farrell has appeared several times on his podcast, and teaches at the Jordan Peterson Academy. Farrell's gentle, thoughtful, softly-spoken demeanor and non-confrontational personal style are often contrasted with those of his men's rights admirers. Farrell himself denies being a men's rights activist, and has recommended avoiding the term \"men's rights\", arguing that it is easily misunderstood as denying the advantages held by men, when the focus should be on the disadvantages men experience. He concedes that the men's rights movement includes a minority of angry and misogynistic members but states that it is vital to acknowledge that men are hurting and are crying out in pain. He suggests that frequent shooting rampages in the US are the result of society not paying attention to the boy crisis and the issue of fatherlessness\".\" He states that through history rights movements have had and have needed more extreme factions.\nIn 2009, the Obama White House asked Farrell to be an advisor to the White House Council on Women and Girls. This led to Farrell starting a commission to create a similar one for boys and men. The multi-partisan group included more than 30 persons knowledgeable and concerned about boys' and men's issues. They submitted a proposal for President Obama to create a White House Council on Boys and Men in 2011, but it was not accepted. In April 2015, the coalition pursued the project by going to Iowa to discuss the proposal with 2016 U.S. presidential candidates. Farrell tried convince the Clinton campaign to acknowledge issues faced by boys and men, including the importance of fathers, but the idea was not adopted. According to Farrell, he spoke about the issue to White House staffers during the 2016 Trump presidency and the 2020 Biden presidency, but neither administration adopted the proposal. During the 2024 presidential campaign, Farrell suggested that the Democrats orientation towards feminism, and lack of focus on issues facing men and boys explained why men were supporting Donald Trump.\nFarrell has served on the board of advisers/directors of the National Coalition for Men, and the Children's Rights Council. He is on the steering committee for the Coalition to Create a White House Council on Boys &amp; Men.\nThe documentary \"\"Warren Farrell Interrupted: The Boy Crisis\",\" covering his life, career and ideas, won the humanitarian documentary award at the Idyllwild International Festival of Cinema in 2025.\nPersonal life.\nAfter his divorce in 1977, Farrell had, by his own account had \"twenty years of adventuresome singlehood\". During this time, he had several serious live-in relationships, including one in which he lived with a stepdaughter. In August 2002, Farrell married Liz Dowling, and he has two stepdaughters. The couple resides in Mill Valley, California.\nDuring the 2003 California gubernatorial recall election, Farrell ran as a Democratic candidate, on a platform of fathers' rights, and received 626 votes.\"\" Farrell backed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 US presidential election.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
